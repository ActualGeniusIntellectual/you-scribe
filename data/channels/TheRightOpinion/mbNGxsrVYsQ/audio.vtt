00:00.000 --> 00:23.900
That goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills because

00:23.900 --> 00:30.100
that challenge is one that we're willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone,

00:30.100 --> 00:32.100
and one we intend to win.

00:42.100 --> 00:49.100
However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at.

00:49.100 --> 00:57.100
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Right of Human, the hope of HVAC in too much of your time.

01:05.100 --> 01:11.100
Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist.

01:20.100 --> 01:30.100
The struggle and the progress, the times we were told that we can't, the people who pressed on with that, yes we can.

01:30.100 --> 01:51.100
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

01:51.100 --> 01:55.100
I'm in a transitional period with my content and I hoped that I would have something else ready today,

01:55.100 --> 01:59.100
however that has been delayed as I underestimated how much work that would actually take.

01:59.100 --> 02:04.100
So today I provide you with an alternative video, a theory that was fluttering around in my mind,

02:04.100 --> 02:08.100
and even if it's not entirely applicable by the time it's released, I hope you take something away from it.

02:08.100 --> 02:13.100
There is one certainty with YouTube, and any media outlet are that, that there will always be news,

02:13.100 --> 02:16.100
whether it's a rat feud, a boxing match, or a dead body.

02:16.100 --> 02:19.100
There is no escaping it, and we as viewers want to know what's going on,

02:19.100 --> 02:23.100
but we also want to cut the crap and have the information that matters fed to us.

02:23.100 --> 02:25.100
We're busy people, we have lives.

02:25.100 --> 02:30.100
When looking for ways to have this information planted into our minds, we may turn towards news channels,

02:30.100 --> 02:34.100
like Drama Alert or Scarce, on the other hand we might look for more thoughtful responses,

02:34.100 --> 02:37.100
such as that found in Colossalist Crazy or The Random Shark.

02:37.100 --> 02:43.100
Now both of these stars have advantages and disadvantages, the news providing us information fairly immediately,

02:43.100 --> 02:46.100
but also depriving us with many additional thoughts and insights,

02:46.100 --> 02:48.100
and although these thoughts may be found in more introspective content,

02:48.100 --> 02:52.100
they're often released towards or even after the end of a topic's shelf life.

02:52.100 --> 02:59.100
So to provide a compromise between the instantaneous nature of news channels and the narrative of informational content,

02:59.100 --> 03:03.100
we turn to commentary, more specifically, trending topics,

03:03.100 --> 03:06.100
which provided the core information that our brains so desperately craved,

03:06.100 --> 03:11.100
while still providing an opinionated narrative that could give audiences reflection to feed off.

03:11.100 --> 03:14.100
It takes both components and packages them nicely.

03:14.100 --> 03:19.100
Emerging out of the ashes of the old reaction genre, Pyrocynical was one of the first to lead the charge,

03:19.100 --> 03:24.100
gradually leaving behind gameplay footage for more personal interactions with his viewers,

03:24.100 --> 03:27.100
often conversing about stuff that was trending and providing his opinions.

03:27.100 --> 03:30.100
This wasn't a huge shift from his old content,

03:30.100 --> 03:35.100
it was just a bit more focused on occurrences that appealed due to its momentous popularity rather than its absurdity.

03:35.100 --> 03:40.100
As this gradually grew in size, Pyrocynical found contemporaries by his side, in many forms,

03:40.100 --> 03:44.100
one of the main channels, I Am Alex, who rose to fame in part thanks to Pyro's shoutout.

03:44.100 --> 03:49.100
He's joined by a slew of smaller channels who've formed what is known as the commentary community.

03:49.100 --> 03:53.100
These players have formed a little lineup that goes around, covers trending topics,

03:53.100 --> 03:55.100
and occasionally collaborates to keep the growth constant.

03:55.100 --> 03:58.100
This is understandable, but nothing lasts forever.

03:58.100 --> 04:01.100
In a way, there are many unique facets to the commentary community that makes it successful,

04:01.100 --> 04:05.100
but there are other drawbacks that also render these creators fragile.

04:05.100 --> 04:09.100
As a friend and even collaborator to many, I have had the experience of spectating the good and bad.

04:09.100 --> 04:12.100
Often these portraits paint a character study of many individuals

04:12.100 --> 04:17.100
and their contribution to something that is a lot more technical than people give it credit for.

04:17.100 --> 04:20.100
So to begin with, let's talk about what goes on behind the scenes.

04:25.100 --> 04:30.100
One of the unsung heroes to the drastic rise of many channels is something known as the algorithm.

04:30.100 --> 04:34.100
The algorithm is sparingly thrown around, but should not be underestimated.

04:34.100 --> 04:38.100
There are many individual tactics that can be spotted if you go on many of these channels,

04:38.100 --> 04:41.100
particularly in the tags and description. What does this mean?

04:41.100 --> 04:42.100
Well, let's take an example.

04:42.100 --> 04:45.100
You search the right opinion net neutrality, you will see four results,

04:45.100 --> 04:48.100
but only two of them have net neutrality in the title.

04:48.100 --> 04:52.100
So how do the algorithms manage to work out that these videos were about net neutrality?

04:52.100 --> 04:56.100
Well, you see, in my description of my tags, I have net neutrality,

04:56.100 --> 04:59.100
and because at the time net neutrality was about to be repealed,

04:59.100 --> 05:02.100
my video But It Was Fine Before did actually better than the others,

05:02.100 --> 05:04.100
even the ones with net neutrality in the title.

05:04.100 --> 05:07.100
The commentary community, and particularly those who cover trending topics,

05:07.100 --> 05:09.100
thrived on this dynamic.

05:09.100 --> 05:12.100
If you click on 90% of commentary community videos,

05:12.100 --> 05:15.100
you'll see lines of very intricate tags, some even with specific styles.

05:15.100 --> 05:19.100
For example, this one mimics the instant results that you see in the search bar.

05:19.100 --> 05:21.100
Or you could take a Tozy's video on Logan Paul,

05:21.100 --> 05:23.100
that despite being released considerably after a lot of creators,

05:23.100 --> 05:25.100
fell into favour with the algorithm,

05:25.100 --> 05:29.100
possibly because its description reflected fellow creator Kavos's very closely.

05:29.100 --> 05:33.100
Now, description and tags aren't specifically unique to the commentary community,

05:33.100 --> 05:36.100
but there is a uniqueness within their meticulousness.

05:36.100 --> 05:37.100
Now, why is this the case?

05:37.100 --> 05:41.100
Well, one person has a specific style towards the algorithms that seems to be successful,

05:41.100 --> 05:44.100
and because we're a community, they have friends.

05:44.100 --> 05:46.100
Let's say they share it with their friend, who shares it with their friend,

05:46.100 --> 05:49.100
and their friends, and so on, until it's basically common knowledge.

05:49.100 --> 05:52.100
And at that point, people double down on their tactics,

05:52.100 --> 05:54.100
and you have to be a part of it,

05:54.100 --> 05:57.100
or else the possibility of missing out on views hovers over your head.

05:57.100 --> 06:00.100
These algorithms aren't particularly groundbreaking on principle,

06:00.100 --> 06:04.100
however, there are many side effects for why creators view them as important.

06:04.100 --> 06:06.100
One of them was the concept of blowing up,

06:06.100 --> 06:08.100
which contrary to its literal interpretations,

06:08.100 --> 06:11.100
meant a severe spike in growth through a strong flow of new subscribers,

06:11.100 --> 06:14.100
bolstered by YouTube's promotion of your content.

06:14.100 --> 06:16.100
When using description and tags correctly,

06:16.100 --> 06:20.100
the algorithm supposedly allowed a knock-on effect that would give the channel momentum,

06:20.100 --> 06:23.100
and thus give your content publicity in a cyclical way,

06:23.100 --> 06:26.100
in which viewers would come and motivate YouTube to promote that content,

06:26.100 --> 06:29.100
and YouTube promoting that content would subsequently cause the viewers to come.

06:29.100 --> 06:31.100
In effect, it's why I'm Alex with Pyro,

06:31.100 --> 06:33.100
and Cavos working with Drama Alert,

06:33.100 --> 06:36.100
may not have brought in a huge amount of immediate subscribers,

06:36.100 --> 06:41.100
but created a collateral effect that brought them thousands of additional fans and followers over the weeks after.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.100
Creating links between all your videos,

06:43.100 --> 06:46.100
and giving them relevance in certain searches and topics that YouTube identified,

06:46.100 --> 06:49.100
was particularly beneficial when it came your time to shine,

06:49.100 --> 06:52.100
and YouTube couldn't be keener to feed off that momentum.

06:52.100 --> 06:55.100
Now as I noted earlier, this became a competitive market,

06:55.100 --> 06:59.100
with people trying to continue this momentum through uploading content at a constant rate,

06:59.100 --> 07:01.100
and not letting their channel quote, die.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.100
On concept, this doesn't sound like a bad idea,

07:03.100 --> 07:06.100
but once the floodgates were open, there was no stopping it.

07:06.100 --> 07:09.100
Now the algorithm seemed to like more trending topic commentators at first.

07:09.100 --> 07:13.100
As certain characters emerged, there was this nature to create algorithms that fed off themselves.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.100
They no longer had to rely on sub-genres.

07:15.100 --> 07:20.100
Whereas a year ago, people were creating content on topics that often leaned into other persuasions,

07:20.100 --> 07:21.100
such as the skeptic community,

07:21.100 --> 07:25.100
now the commentary community was emerging, they could choose who they decided who they made famous.

07:25.100 --> 07:27.100
We want to make Zoella a big deal? We can.

07:27.100 --> 07:30.100
We want to make Onision a big deal? Sure, go for it.

07:30.100 --> 07:35.100
If you were looking through a window, the commentary community for a brief few months seemed self-sufficient.

07:35.100 --> 07:40.100
There was a new power harness thanks to these connections harbored by some very ingenious marketing.

07:40.100 --> 07:44.100
But there was still a dependence that actually made the community rather fragile.

07:44.100 --> 07:47.100
Although commentary had partly established itself, it remained on life support.

07:47.100 --> 07:53.100
That life support being larger YouTubers who were the individual targets of the commentary community on many occasions.

07:53.100 --> 07:57.100
Tana Mongeau, Onision, Zoella, KSI, the Paul brothers, the list goes on.

07:57.100 --> 08:02.100
Whereas other communities had zeroed in on their own appeal, the commentary community could only feed off other peoples.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.100
After all, that's what commentary is.

08:04.100 --> 08:07.100
But there are plenty of other communities that feed off larger issues.

08:07.100 --> 08:08.100
Look at the skeptic community, for example.

08:08.100 --> 08:11.100
What happens when they run out of people to feed off?

08:11.100 --> 08:16.100
Well, they turn on themselves sometimes, because the skeptic community thrives on a difference of opinion,

08:16.100 --> 08:19.100
and not one that I personally like, and I'll expand on that in the future.

08:19.100 --> 08:23.100
Nonetheless, ideological differences are inherently easy to make content about,

08:23.100 --> 08:26.100
and when differences seem less likely, they can be manufactured.

08:26.100 --> 08:31.100
Even remnants of the FIFA community manage to revive their career by forging a feud.

08:31.100 --> 08:35.100
The commentary community has this appearance that it only goes after bad people.

08:35.100 --> 08:39.100
The scammers, the liars, the manipulators, the people who film corpses.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.100
And therefore, it doesn't often turn on itself.

08:41.100 --> 08:44.100
None of the commentators are inherently evil as such.

08:44.100 --> 08:48.100
On the surface, many of them just seem like normal human beings who have stumbled online.

08:48.100 --> 08:51.100
That's not to say that drama within the community doesn't happen at all.

08:51.100 --> 08:55.100
IMAX's two most popular videos involve his nemesis, Kavos,

08:55.100 --> 09:00.100
and Pyrocynical's old video on Keemstar harbored more views than any Drama Alert video released.

09:00.100 --> 09:02.100
Bar dollar in the woods, the timeless classic.

09:02.100 --> 09:05.100
But setting aside the two antagonistic figures that I have listed,

09:05.100 --> 09:10.100
many of the members in the community have seemingly dodged criticism due to quote moral principles,

09:10.100 --> 09:14.100
and anyone who has attempted to make comprehensive videos on other more grounded figures

09:14.100 --> 09:19.100
have been pretty harshly hit by the fanbases, even when the points themselves have been perfectly valid.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.100
Take Woolly One's video, for example. Why is this an issue?

09:22.100 --> 09:24.100
Well, let's talk about the morality complex.

09:27.100 --> 09:31.100
You know the sort of distaste you feel when you go after a quote good person?

09:31.100 --> 09:35.100
Many come across and say, well, he's just doing what he's doing, there's no point criticising him,

09:35.100 --> 09:38.100
just leave them be, they're not hurting anyone, they're good people really.

09:38.100 --> 09:42.100
They may be the best person to exist, but if you feel their content is inadequate,

09:42.100 --> 09:44.100
you are completely in your right to speak up.

09:44.100 --> 09:48.100
Nonetheless, even if the points are valid, if it's someone you like, it can be hard to watch,

09:48.100 --> 09:52.100
and that is understandable, but it also could be crippling to the notion of improvement

09:52.100 --> 09:55.100
if you do decide to refrain from criticism.

09:55.100 --> 09:58.100
When you go after a person who is perceived as nice or well liked,

09:58.100 --> 10:01.100
you'll see illogical comments like the ones shown on screen,

10:01.100 --> 10:03.100
where people are trying to articulate that gut objection,

10:03.100 --> 10:07.100
but end up either just calling him a hypocrite or some other slur,

10:07.100 --> 10:10.100
despite the fact that they cannot justify nor qualify their arguments.

10:10.100 --> 10:14.100
Another popular attack is somehow that because these channels are in the same genre,

10:14.100 --> 10:18.100
they have no grounds to attack each other, as if there is no spectrum of quality at all,

10:18.100 --> 10:22.100
or the classic, they have more subscribers than you, so you're just doing this for views argument,

10:22.100 --> 10:27.100
which is just unbelievably hilarious considering the commentary is built on making content

10:27.100 --> 10:29.100
about people with more subscribers than yourself.

10:29.100 --> 10:31.100
How is this morality complex arisen then?

10:31.100 --> 10:34.100
Many of these YouTubers take the courtesy of delivering damning criticism

10:34.100 --> 10:38.100
in a way that condemns actions of people who may be behaving immorally.

10:38.100 --> 10:42.100
The reason that IMAX's video-slash-response to Kavos on Philip DeFranco's Patreon

10:42.100 --> 10:47.100
was more well received than the original was that in spite of the unsubstantiated assumptions in both videos,

10:47.100 --> 10:52.100
Alex simply executed his comments in a way that seemed more believable and impartial.

10:52.100 --> 10:55.100
He levied the respect that people have for him to his advantage.

10:55.100 --> 10:59.100
And given the fact that a lot of these commentators often go after people conducting bad actions

10:59.100 --> 11:04.100
or just behaving terribly, people feel hesitant to call them out if they make mistakes,

11:04.100 --> 11:08.100
as they feel that in doing it, they'd be thrown into the corner of defending someone like Logan Paul,

11:08.100 --> 11:11.100
and let's face it, no one wants to do that.

11:11.100 --> 11:15.100
And mistakes can be very damaging, particularly if an audience believes them.

11:15.100 --> 11:20.100
Even the plethora of videos on Kavos only typically complain about his behaviour or demeanour,

11:20.100 --> 11:23.100
or a few videos where he goes after more ambiguous characters.

11:23.100 --> 11:27.100
People don't generally want to say, well here, this is what they got wrong about Logan Paul,

11:27.100 --> 11:30.100
because it's Logan Paul, and they're going against the moral right.

11:30.100 --> 11:36.100
People often allow their own judgement of character to prevent them from criticising the content that they may be watching.

11:36.100 --> 11:40.100
You hate Tana Mongeau? You'll love this video attacking her with certain factual mistakes.

11:40.100 --> 11:46.100
The closeness and proximity of many of these YouTubers also contributes to people refraining from making content of them.

11:46.100 --> 11:52.100
Many of these creators may be afraid to alienate their own fanbases or even friends in trying to talk about a certain YouTuber.

11:52.100 --> 11:54.100
Even larger YouTubers have this apprehension.

11:54.100 --> 12:00.100
In essence, by having a community, many of the largest creators have the power to monopolise a narrative.

12:00.100 --> 12:04.100
These creators being so transcendent to the drama has essentially done two things.

12:04.100 --> 12:06.100
One made people feel bad when they want to criticise them,

12:06.100 --> 12:11.100
and two created culture where the fans seem to defend regardless of how bad the criticisms are.

12:11.100 --> 12:13.100
The vitriol can be pretty strong.

12:13.100 --> 12:19.100
In my opinion, that's not healthy, because even from the most derivative video, they might still take something away from it.

12:19.100 --> 12:23.100
If you're a nice person, it does not mean your content is equally as nice.

12:23.100 --> 12:26.100
At this point, some may say, well, why don't they just resolve it in private?

12:26.100 --> 12:29.100
Ignoring the fact that a lot of larger YouTubers are more inaccessible,

12:29.100 --> 12:33.100
and that obviously criticism videos can be done just for the notion of entertaining an audience,

12:33.100 --> 12:39.100
they often have a unique effect on the creator within the realisation that content does have value.

12:39.100 --> 12:41.100
Among the shit that I've shown on screen,

12:41.100 --> 12:46.100
there were also multiple comments on Woolly's video about people pretending to be fans of WildSpark's content,

12:46.100 --> 12:48.100
but still agreeing with the points that he makes.

12:48.100 --> 12:52.100
These comments were equally or even more plentiful than the negative ones,

12:52.100 --> 12:53.100
and probably more important.

12:53.100 --> 12:58.100
To me, these reflected an accelerated sentiment that was going to arise on his content regardless,

12:58.100 --> 13:00.100
the one that people just couldn't pin down at the time.

13:00.100 --> 13:04.100
Critiques can be important, not just for outlining your weaknesses, but your strengths,

13:04.100 --> 13:09.100
and should help paint a clearer image of yourself, perceived by your own and other viewers.

13:09.100 --> 13:13.100
This was a mild tangent, but an important one, because it has not always been that way.

13:13.100 --> 13:16.100
From the grounds that the new commentary community sprouted from, there was a lot of drama.

13:16.100 --> 13:21.100
It was easier to do it back then because there wasn't a standard in a lot of what people did.

13:21.100 --> 13:26.100
The content was more easy-going, you know, you could just be reacting to whatever crazy video existed on YouTube,

13:26.100 --> 13:27.100
survived on its own terms.

13:27.100 --> 13:31.100
However, since the new community has erupted, conduct has become a staple.

13:31.100 --> 13:34.100
However, due to the staple, other staples have been deserted.

13:34.100 --> 13:38.100
A community that thrives on drama has trouble creating any drama of its own.

13:38.100 --> 13:42.100
One of the only people who has been completely untouched through this drought is Pyrocynical,

13:42.100 --> 13:47.100
and that's in part because his persona has its own appeal, something that many commentators can lack.

13:47.100 --> 13:51.100
In addition to that, the fact that he has a widely established fanbase over areas of content

13:51.100 --> 13:54.100
has granted him the mobility to cover whatever he wants.

13:54.100 --> 13:59.100
And that is fine, as long as drama is happening somewhere else, what happens when it dries up?

13:59.100 --> 14:04.100
What happens when the only people creating any alternative narrative are either quitting or gone?

14:04.100 --> 14:09.100
What do you do when you have centered your channel around current topics and algorithmic appeal?

14:09.100 --> 14:14.100
Due to the monopolization of narratives, the smaller channels often cover the same sorts of topics that the larger channels cover,

14:14.100 --> 14:17.100
and once the larger channels ran dry, so did a lot of other people.

14:17.100 --> 14:20.100
Certain ideas in the community are not fashionable anymore.

14:20.100 --> 14:24.100
People have limited themselves in the content that they make. No one wants to upset anyone.

14:24.100 --> 14:26.100
Even in the last year, the scope has narrowed.

14:26.100 --> 14:31.100
People that had content made on them a year ago that are still around to this day have seemingly been forgotten about.

14:31.100 --> 14:36.100
That's fine for a civilized society, but the simple truth is that people want to watch a train wreck.

14:36.100 --> 14:40.100
Now normally that would be okay too, they could just make some content and weather the storm,

14:40.100 --> 14:43.100
but for the first time in a long time, there's real competition.

14:44.100 --> 14:51.100
Reactions

14:51.100 --> 14:55.100
Reaction is a new type of commentary that has taken the algorithms tidily,

14:55.100 --> 15:00.100
pivoting around the very cunning bait-and-switch raw footage thumbnail and reaction commentary that follows.

15:00.100 --> 15:04.100
It is headed by Trigger Trope, with channels like Benji and Just Destiny on the coattails.

15:04.100 --> 15:08.100
It most often focuses on reacting to TV footage of peculiar people.

15:08.100 --> 15:12.100
Though there are some variants, it originated as mostly Dr. Phil reactions,

15:12.100 --> 15:17.100
but now seems to be gradually branching out, particularly with the explosive success of another YouTuber, Aiden Projects.

15:17.100 --> 15:20.100
Now they've been growing at a decent rate for a few months.

15:20.100 --> 15:23.100
Don't count this as something that has happened overnight,

15:23.100 --> 15:28.100
but for the first time in the last couple weeks, they've had complete advantage over the competing genres of YouTube.

15:28.100 --> 15:33.100
The commentators identified this, but in a brief moment of panic, instead of considering the genre that they were a part of,

15:33.100 --> 15:39.100
trending topic commentators favoured individualism and switched over to this content in an attempt to stay afloat.

15:39.100 --> 15:42.100
But it mostly failed. Why? Why did it fail?

15:42.100 --> 15:48.100
Well, a few reasons. Firstly, in narrowing their content over the months prior, they had subsequently narrowed their channel's appeal,

15:48.100 --> 15:52.100
and therefore when attempting to branch out, many of the fanbase were disinterested,

15:52.100 --> 15:59.100
and if that core fanbase doesn't turn out, then it's very hard to build up the momentum favourable with the aforementioned algorithm that they value so much.

15:59.100 --> 16:02.100
Algorithms aren't just based on topic alone.

16:02.100 --> 16:06.100
Although the content that these creators make do share some common ingredients with reaction,

16:06.100 --> 16:10.100
the fanbase of such is assumedly more mature than the persuasion of many of the reaction channels.

16:10.100 --> 16:14.100
For example, reaction channel Benji recently did a poll of his audience on Twitter,

16:14.100 --> 16:17.100
and although obviously there are methodological flaws with such a poll,

16:17.100 --> 16:20.100
I would still expect it to be somewhat reasonable representation.

16:20.100 --> 16:22.100
And well, the results speak for themselves.

16:22.100 --> 16:26.100
Another huge reason is that the personality of hosts do not suit them.

16:26.100 --> 16:29.100
Whereas reaction channels were energetic and relied on some form of comedy,

16:29.100 --> 16:31.100
trending topics never fully leaned on the comedy.

16:31.100 --> 16:35.100
They relied on the opinion of their host and the trust that they pertain from the audience.

16:35.100 --> 16:38.100
Comedy was just an enhancement to them, it was never a necessity,

16:38.100 --> 16:44.100
therefore the fanbase they accumulated was much more on this basis of reason rather than just instant humour.

16:44.100 --> 16:47.100
Instead of railing against this content that their position always seemed above,

16:47.100 --> 16:54.100
they tried to get on board with it, essentially killing off any possibility of them criticising it in the future without looking like huge hypocrites.

16:54.100 --> 16:57.100
And make no mistake, I'm not saying that reaction would kill off trending topics,

16:57.100 --> 17:00.100
not even the YouTubers, trending topics will always exist,

17:00.100 --> 17:03.100
but the brand of commentary responding to it is fragile,

17:03.100 --> 17:05.100
and what they've done is hem themselves in.

17:05.100 --> 17:10.100
Why would the same audience that watches these people who deride Lele Pons and her contemporaries as not funny

17:10.100 --> 17:13.100
want to see them partake in humour equally as juvenile?

17:13.100 --> 17:19.100
Aidan Project's transition from commentary to reaction only worked because of his core fanbase, mostly from Keemstar, wanted it.

17:19.100 --> 17:24.100
This may have been possible a year ago when the subjects these channels covered were broader and more diverse,

17:24.100 --> 17:26.100
but the appeal has appeared to converge in the months prior.

17:26.100 --> 17:30.100
Now obviously, when specific topics are trending, this can be to their advantage,

17:30.100 --> 17:35.100
as the algorithm recognises a noticeable amount of content and views, and thus rewards it with more views,

17:35.100 --> 17:41.100
hence subscribers, such as the Onision situation, in which videos on Onision were garnering more views than actual Onision videos.

17:41.100 --> 17:45.100
However, this also does create subscribers who are there for the topic over the commentator,

17:45.100 --> 17:52.100
and once that dried up, it was hard for these YouTubers to mix up their content without disengaging a significant proportion of subscribers.

17:52.100 --> 17:56.100
I often look in the related channels as an indicator of what sort of fanbase these people have,

17:56.100 --> 18:02.100
and you might notice the related channels of these reaction commentaries are significantly different to the trending topic commentators.

18:02.100 --> 18:06.100
I'm not saying that proves anything, but it is food for thought.

18:06.100 --> 18:13.100
In this new wave of reaction commentary, trending topic commentators found content that was similar enough to compete with them in the commentary subgenre,

18:13.100 --> 18:17.100
but not close enough for them to assimilate to and retain a compelling view count.

18:17.100 --> 18:21.100
For better and for worse, there is a different audience for a lot of these commentators,

18:21.100 --> 18:28.100
and even if the topics themselves weren't bad on premise, the expectation of humour that the genre has due to channels like Trigger Tro

18:28.100 --> 18:33.100
and such setting it up has essentially given it a brand of what people expect,

18:33.100 --> 18:38.100
so even if these trending topic commentators made reaction style videos their own,

18:38.100 --> 18:43.100
people probably won't give it the click they need, because they already had that expectation.

18:43.100 --> 18:46.100
To summarise, they were kind of finished before they'd even started.

18:46.100 --> 18:48.100
But what does this all mean in the grand scheme of things?

18:48.100 --> 18:52.100
We put out a lot of points, but how do we tie them together in a neat bow?

18:52.100 --> 18:54.100
Well, my friends, let's give it a try.

18:58.100 --> 19:03.100
Throughout the last year, content has been discovered that hinges partly on the power of algorithms.

19:03.100 --> 19:10.100
The use of meticulous description and tags has enabled many trending topic commentators to cover areas that gives them traction with many fanbases.

19:10.100 --> 19:15.100
However, the problem with relying on algorithms alone is that if you fall out of favour with them, then you're screwed.

19:15.100 --> 19:19.100
Many of these creators recognised this and tried to add some personality,

19:19.100 --> 19:23.100
however most of it ended up being overshadowed by the notion of moral righteousness

19:23.100 --> 19:26.100
that simultaneously shielded them from criticism of content a lot of the time

19:26.100 --> 19:31.100
and held them out of drama they may have had the opportunity to involve themselves in in the past,

19:31.100 --> 19:33.100
unless it was a clear wrongdoing.

19:33.100 --> 19:37.100
Otherwise, people only seemed to enjoy pointing out hypocrisy and inadequate content

19:37.100 --> 19:40.100
when it was signalled by larger people outside the community,

19:40.100 --> 19:44.100
mainly because of the unification of the smaller community and the domination of certain narratives,

19:44.100 --> 19:49.100
to the point that going against these narratives, or the YouTubers that make them, could be seen as blasphemous.

19:49.100 --> 19:54.100
In the last few months, the trending topics became very focused and directed at a few people.

19:54.100 --> 19:57.100
This is also okay providing these people continue to appeal to the public,

19:57.100 --> 20:03.100
however with the escalation at the peak of the Logan Paul drama, there was an eventual inertia that people stopped watching.

20:03.100 --> 20:08.100
In the past, even when the topics weren't trending, the lack of other options for commentary content

20:08.100 --> 20:12.100
would encourage the viewer to check out a trending topic commentator anyway,

20:12.100 --> 20:15.100
even if the subject itself wasn't particularly riveting.

20:15.100 --> 20:21.100
However, when the new challenger entered the ring, it perplexed the commentators into trying to integrate their channels into it.

20:21.100 --> 20:25.100
This did not work, as much akin to a KFC opening next to a McDonald's,

20:25.100 --> 20:28.100
although you may face competition the appeal isn't identical.

20:28.100 --> 20:31.100
If you can't see what I'm saying here, commentary is not a tale of death,

20:31.100 --> 20:35.100
it is a tale of survival, and unfortunately when you're surviving and even thriving,

20:35.100 --> 20:38.100
you don't think of all the factors that's keeping your channel alive,

20:38.100 --> 20:41.100
you only realise it when it's gone, or something's wrong.

20:41.100 --> 20:45.100
Trending topics are propped up on multiple other conditions, often beyond their control,

20:45.100 --> 20:49.100
and when these conditions withdraw at once, the effect is felt by many.

20:49.100 --> 20:53.100
This drought will probably pass, and will return to the oasis of trending topics in the future.

20:53.100 --> 20:56.100
Maybe by this time the video's out, we'll be past it all and living it up.

20:56.100 --> 21:00.100
But this was a warning, and I've watched friends and people I admire

21:00.100 --> 21:03.100
put their lives and careers on the line to pursue the YouTube dream,

21:03.100 --> 21:06.100
and the simple truth is that some may not cut it.

21:06.100 --> 21:10.100
Times are changing, content is changing, you have to remember what brought people to your channel,

21:10.100 --> 21:13.100
and what's gonna keep them there, and even if you can keep them there.

21:13.100 --> 21:17.100
From the get-go, commentary channels were stuck between the rock of news channels

21:17.100 --> 21:22.100
and the hard place of informational content, and when the walls close in, the pressure shows.

21:22.100 --> 21:26.100
The commentary rat race promoted by algorithms and topics has driven people insane,

21:26.100 --> 21:29.100
trying to keep the news coming even when there isn't any,

21:29.100 --> 21:32.100
and when they ran out of targets, they ran out of ammunition,

21:32.100 --> 21:35.100
creating a dependency and a fear of channel death.

21:35.100 --> 21:37.100
No death is certain, and no death is immediate,

21:37.100 --> 21:41.100
but a run of careless decisions and algorithmic exploitation has led us here.

21:41.100 --> 21:44.100
How you respond is your own destiny from here on.

21:44.100 --> 21:47.100
Maybe it'll right itself, maybe we will have to change.

21:47.100 --> 21:50.100
Whatever it does, I hope it succeeds.

21:50.100 --> 21:53.100
There are many prices paid within failure.

21:53.100 --> 21:56.100
I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

22:07.100 --> 22:09.100
Thanks for watching!
