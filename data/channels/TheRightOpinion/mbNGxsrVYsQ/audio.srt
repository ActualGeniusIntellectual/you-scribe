1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,900
That goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills because

2
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:30,100
that challenge is one that we're willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone,

3
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,100
and one we intend to win.

4
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:49,100
However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at.

5
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:57,100
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Right of Human, the hope of HVAC in too much of your time.

6
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:11,100
Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist.

7
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:30,100
The struggle and the progress, the times we were told that we can't, the people who pressed on with that, yes we can.

8
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:51,100
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

9
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,100
I'm in a transitional period with my content and I hoped that I would have something else ready today,

10
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,100
however that has been delayed as I underestimated how much work that would actually take.

11
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,100
So today I provide you with an alternative video, a theory that was fluttering around in my mind,

12
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,100
and even if it's not entirely applicable by the time it's released, I hope you take something away from it.

13
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,100
There is one certainty with YouTube, and any media outlet are that, that there will always be news,

14
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,100
whether it's a rat feud, a boxing match, or a dead body.

15
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,100
There is no escaping it, and we as viewers want to know what's going on,

16
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,100
but we also want to cut the crap and have the information that matters fed to us.

17
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,100
We're busy people, we have lives.

18
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:30,100
When looking for ways to have this information planted into our minds, we may turn towards news channels,

19
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,100
like Drama Alert or Scarce, on the other hand we might look for more thoughtful responses,

20
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,100
such as that found in Colossalist Crazy or The Random Shark.

21
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:43,100
Now both of these stars have advantages and disadvantages, the news providing us information fairly immediately,

22
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,100
but also depriving us with many additional thoughts and insights,

23
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,100
and although these thoughts may be found in more introspective content,

24
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,100
they're often released towards or even after the end of a topic's shelf life.

25
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:59,100
So to provide a compromise between the instantaneous nature of news channels and the narrative of informational content,

26
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,100
we turn to commentary, more specifically, trending topics,

27
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,100
which provided the core information that our brains so desperately craved,

28
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:11,100
while still providing an opinionated narrative that could give audiences reflection to feed off.

29
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,100
It takes both components and packages them nicely.

30
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:19,100
Emerging out of the ashes of the old reaction genre, Pyrocynical was one of the first to lead the charge,

31
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:24,100
gradually leaving behind gameplay footage for more personal interactions with his viewers,

32
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,100
often conversing about stuff that was trending and providing his opinions.

33
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,100
This wasn't a huge shift from his old content,

34
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:35,100
it was just a bit more focused on occurrences that appealed due to its momentous popularity rather than its absurdity.

35
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,100
As this gradually grew in size, Pyrocynical found contemporaries by his side, in many forms,

36
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,100
one of the main channels, I Am Alex, who rose to fame in part thanks to Pyro's shoutout.

37
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,100
He's joined by a slew of smaller channels who've formed what is known as the commentary community.

38
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,100
These players have formed a little lineup that goes around, covers trending topics,

39
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,100
and occasionally collaborates to keep the growth constant.

40
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,100
This is understandable, but nothing lasts forever.

41
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,100
In a way, there are many unique facets to the commentary community that makes it successful,

42
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,100
but there are other drawbacks that also render these creators fragile.

43
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,100
As a friend and even collaborator to many, I have had the experience of spectating the good and bad.

44
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,100
Often these portraits paint a character study of many individuals

45
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,100
and their contribution to something that is a lot more technical than people give it credit for.

46
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,100
So to begin with, let's talk about what goes on behind the scenes.

47
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:30,100
One of the unsung heroes to the drastic rise of many channels is something known as the algorithm.

48
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,100
The algorithm is sparingly thrown around, but should not be underestimated.

49
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,100
There are many individual tactics that can be spotted if you go on many of these channels,

50
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,100
particularly in the tags and description. What does this mean?

51
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,100
Well, let's take an example.

52
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,100
You search the right opinion net neutrality, you will see four results,

53
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,100
but only two of them have net neutrality in the title.

54
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,100
So how do the algorithms manage to work out that these videos were about net neutrality?

55
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,100
Well, you see, in my description of my tags, I have net neutrality,

56
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,100
and because at the time net neutrality was about to be repealed,

57
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,100
my video But It Was Fine Before did actually better than the others,

58
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,100
even the ones with net neutrality in the title.

59
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,100
The commentary community, and particularly those who cover trending topics,

60
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,100
thrived on this dynamic.

61
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,100
If you click on 90% of commentary community videos,

62
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,100
you'll see lines of very intricate tags, some even with specific styles.

63
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,100
For example, this one mimics the instant results that you see in the search bar.

64
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,100
Or you could take a Tozy's video on Logan Paul,

65
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,100
that despite being released considerably after a lot of creators,

66
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,100
fell into favour with the algorithm,

67
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,100
possibly because its description reflected fellow creator Kavos's very closely.

68
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,100
Now, description and tags aren't specifically unique to the commentary community,

69
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,100
but there is a uniqueness within their meticulousness.

70
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,100
Now, why is this the case?

71
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,100
Well, one person has a specific style towards the algorithms that seems to be successful,

72
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,100
and because we're a community, they have friends.

73
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,100
Let's say they share it with their friend, who shares it with their friend,

74
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,100
and their friends, and so on, until it's basically common knowledge.

75
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,100
And at that point, people double down on their tactics,

76
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,100
and you have to be a part of it,

77
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,100
or else the possibility of missing out on views hovers over your head.

78
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,100
These algorithms aren't particularly groundbreaking on principle,

79
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,100
however, there are many side effects for why creators view them as important.

80
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,100
One of them was the concept of blowing up,

81
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,100
which contrary to its literal interpretations,

82
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,100
meant a severe spike in growth through a strong flow of new subscribers,

83
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,100
bolstered by YouTube's promotion of your content.

84
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,100
When using description and tags correctly,

85
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,100
the algorithm supposedly allowed a knock-on effect that would give the channel momentum,

86
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,100
and thus give your content publicity in a cyclical way,

87
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,100
in which viewers would come and motivate YouTube to promote that content,

88
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,100
and YouTube promoting that content would subsequently cause the viewers to come.

89
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,100
In effect, it's why I'm Alex with Pyro,

90
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,100
and Cavos working with Drama Alert,

91
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,100
may not have brought in a huge amount of immediate subscribers,

92
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:41,100
but created a collateral effect that brought them thousands of additional fans and followers over the weeks after.

93
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,100
Creating links between all your videos,

94
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,100
and giving them relevance in certain searches and topics that YouTube identified,

95
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,100
was particularly beneficial when it came your time to shine,

96
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,100
and YouTube couldn't be keener to feed off that momentum.

97
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,100
Now as I noted earlier, this became a competitive market,

98
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,100
with people trying to continue this momentum through uploading content at a constant rate,

99
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,100
and not letting their channel quote, die.

100
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,100
On concept, this doesn't sound like a bad idea,

101
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,100
but once the floodgates were open, there was no stopping it.

102
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,100
Now the algorithm seemed to like more trending topic commentators at first.

103
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,100
As certain characters emerged, there was this nature to create algorithms that fed off themselves.

104
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,100
They no longer had to rely on sub-genres.

105
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,100
Whereas a year ago, people were creating content on topics that often leaned into other persuasions,

106
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,100
such as the skeptic community,

107
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,100
now the commentary community was emerging, they could choose who they decided who they made famous.

108
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,100
We want to make Zoella a big deal? We can.

109
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,100
We want to make Onision a big deal? Sure, go for it.

110
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:35,100
If you were looking through a window, the commentary community for a brief few months seemed self-sufficient.

111
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,100
There was a new power harness thanks to these connections harbored by some very ingenious marketing.

112
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,100
But there was still a dependence that actually made the community rather fragile.

113
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,100
Although commentary had partly established itself, it remained on life support.

114
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:53,100
That life support being larger YouTubers who were the individual targets of the commentary community on many occasions.

115
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,100
Tana Mongeau, Onision, Zoella, KSI, the Paul brothers, the list goes on.

116
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:02,100
Whereas other communities had zeroed in on their own appeal, the commentary community could only feed off other peoples.

117
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,100
After all, that's what commentary is.

118
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,100
But there are plenty of other communities that feed off larger issues.

119
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,100
Look at the skeptic community, for example.

120
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,100
What happens when they run out of people to feed off?

121
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:16,100
Well, they turn on themselves sometimes, because the skeptic community thrives on a difference of opinion,

122
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,100
and not one that I personally like, and I'll expand on that in the future.

123
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,100
Nonetheless, ideological differences are inherently easy to make content about,

124
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,100
and when differences seem less likely, they can be manufactured.

125
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:31,100
Even remnants of the FIFA community manage to revive their career by forging a feud.

126
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,100
The commentary community has this appearance that it only goes after bad people.

127
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,100
The scammers, the liars, the manipulators, the people who film corpses.

128
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,100
And therefore, it doesn't often turn on itself.

129
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,100
None of the commentators are inherently evil as such.

130
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,100
On the surface, many of them just seem like normal human beings who have stumbled online.

131
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,100
That's not to say that drama within the community doesn't happen at all.

132
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,100
IMAX's two most popular videos involve his nemesis, Kavos,

133
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,100
and Pyrocynical's old video on Keemstar harbored more views than any Drama Alert video released.

134
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,100
Bar dollar in the woods, the timeless classic.

135
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,100
But setting aside the two antagonistic figures that I have listed,

136
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,100
many of the members in the community have seemingly dodged criticism due to quote moral principles,

137
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,100
and anyone who has attempted to make comprehensive videos on other more grounded figures

138
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,100
have been pretty harshly hit by the fanbases, even when the points themselves have been perfectly valid.

139
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,100
Take Woolly One's video, for example. Why is this an issue?

140
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,100
Well, let's talk about the morality complex.

141
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,100
You know the sort of distaste you feel when you go after a quote good person?

142
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,100
Many come across and say, well, he's just doing what he's doing, there's no point criticising him,

143
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,100
just leave them be, they're not hurting anyone, they're good people really.

144
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,100
They may be the best person to exist, but if you feel their content is inadequate,

145
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,100
you are completely in your right to speak up.

146
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,100
Nonetheless, even if the points are valid, if it's someone you like, it can be hard to watch,

147
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,100
and that is understandable, but it also could be crippling to the notion of improvement

148
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,100
if you do decide to refrain from criticism.

149
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,100
When you go after a person who is perceived as nice or well liked,

150
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,100
you'll see illogical comments like the ones shown on screen,

151
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,100
where people are trying to articulate that gut objection,

152
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,100
but end up either just calling him a hypocrite or some other slur,

153
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,100
despite the fact that they cannot justify nor qualify their arguments.

154
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,100
Another popular attack is somehow that because these channels are in the same genre,

155
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,100
they have no grounds to attack each other, as if there is no spectrum of quality at all,

156
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,100
or the classic, they have more subscribers than you, so you're just doing this for views argument,

157
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:27,100
which is just unbelievably hilarious considering the commentary is built on making content

158
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,100
about people with more subscribers than yourself.

159
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,100
How is this morality complex arisen then?

160
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Many of these YouTubers take the courtesy of delivering damning criticism

161
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,100
in a way that condemns actions of people who may be behaving immorally.

162
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,100
The reason that IMAX's video-slash-response to Kavos on Philip DeFranco's Patreon

163
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,100
was more well received than the original was that in spite of the unsubstantiated assumptions in both videos,

164
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,100
Alex simply executed his comments in a way that seemed more believable and impartial.

165
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,100
He levied the respect that people have for him to his advantage.

166
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,100
And given the fact that a lot of these commentators often go after people conducting bad actions

167
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,100
or just behaving terribly, people feel hesitant to call them out if they make mistakes,

168
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,100
as they feel that in doing it, they'd be thrown into the corner of defending someone like Logan Paul,

169
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,100
and let's face it, no one wants to do that.

170
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,100
And mistakes can be very damaging, particularly if an audience believes them.

171
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:20,100
Even the plethora of videos on Kavos only typically complain about his behaviour or demeanour,

172
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,100
or a few videos where he goes after more ambiguous characters.

173
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,100
People don't generally want to say, well here, this is what they got wrong about Logan Paul,

174
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,100
because it's Logan Paul, and they're going against the moral right.

175
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:36,100
People often allow their own judgement of character to prevent them from criticising the content that they may be watching.

176
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,100
You hate Tana Mongeau? You'll love this video attacking her with certain factual mistakes.

177
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:46,100
The closeness and proximity of many of these YouTubers also contributes to people refraining from making content of them.

178
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:52,100
Many of these creators may be afraid to alienate their own fanbases or even friends in trying to talk about a certain YouTuber.

179
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,100
Even larger YouTubers have this apprehension.

180
00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:00,100
In essence, by having a community, many of the largest creators have the power to monopolise a narrative.

181
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,100
These creators being so transcendent to the drama has essentially done two things.

182
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
One made people feel bad when they want to criticise them,

183
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,100
and two created culture where the fans seem to defend regardless of how bad the criticisms are.

184
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,100
The vitriol can be pretty strong.

185
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:19,100
In my opinion, that's not healthy, because even from the most derivative video, they might still take something away from it.

186
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,100
If you're a nice person, it does not mean your content is equally as nice.

187
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,100
At this point, some may say, well, why don't they just resolve it in private?

188
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,100
Ignoring the fact that a lot of larger YouTubers are more inaccessible,

189
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,100
and that obviously criticism videos can be done just for the notion of entertaining an audience,

190
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:39,100
they often have a unique effect on the creator within the realisation that content does have value.

191
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,100
Among the shit that I've shown on screen,

192
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,100
there were also multiple comments on Woolly's video about people pretending to be fans of WildSpark's content,

193
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,100
but still agreeing with the points that he makes.

194
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,100
These comments were equally or even more plentiful than the negative ones,

195
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,100
and probably more important.

196
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,100
To me, these reflected an accelerated sentiment that was going to arise on his content regardless,

197
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,100
the one that people just couldn't pin down at the time.

198
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,100
Critiques can be important, not just for outlining your weaknesses, but your strengths,

199
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,100
and should help paint a clearer image of yourself, perceived by your own and other viewers.

200
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,100
This was a mild tangent, but an important one, because it has not always been that way.

201
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,100
From the grounds that the new commentary community sprouted from, there was a lot of drama.

202
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:21,100
It was easier to do it back then because there wasn't a standard in a lot of what people did.

203
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,100
The content was more easy-going, you know, you could just be reacting to whatever crazy video existed on YouTube,

204
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,100
survived on its own terms.

205
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,100
However, since the new community has erupted, conduct has become a staple.

206
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,100
However, due to the staple, other staples have been deserted.

207
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,100
A community that thrives on drama has trouble creating any drama of its own.

208
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,100
One of the only people who has been completely untouched through this drought is Pyrocynical,

209
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:47,100
and that's in part because his persona has its own appeal, something that many commentators can lack.

210
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,100
In addition to that, the fact that he has a widely established fanbase over areas of content

211
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,100
has granted him the mobility to cover whatever he wants.

212
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:59,100
And that is fine, as long as drama is happening somewhere else, what happens when it dries up?

213
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,100
What happens when the only people creating any alternative narrative are either quitting or gone?

214
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:09,100
What do you do when you have centered your channel around current topics and algorithmic appeal?

215
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:14,100
Due to the monopolization of narratives, the smaller channels often cover the same sorts of topics that the larger channels cover,

216
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,100
and once the larger channels ran dry, so did a lot of other people.

217
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,100
Certain ideas in the community are not fashionable anymore.

218
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,100
People have limited themselves in the content that they make. No one wants to upset anyone.

219
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,100
Even in the last year, the scope has narrowed.

220
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:31,100
People that had content made on them a year ago that are still around to this day have seemingly been forgotten about.

221
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,100
That's fine for a civilized society, but the simple truth is that people want to watch a train wreck.

222
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,100
Now normally that would be okay too, they could just make some content and weather the storm,

223
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,100
but for the first time in a long time, there's real competition.

224
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:51,100
Reactions

225
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:55,100
Reaction is a new type of commentary that has taken the algorithms tidily,

226
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:00,100
pivoting around the very cunning bait-and-switch raw footage thumbnail and reaction commentary that follows.

227
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,100
It is headed by Trigger Trope, with channels like Benji and Just Destiny on the coattails.

228
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,100
It most often focuses on reacting to TV footage of peculiar people.

229
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,100
Though there are some variants, it originated as mostly Dr. Phil reactions,

230
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:17,100
but now seems to be gradually branching out, particularly with the explosive success of another YouTuber, Aiden Projects.

231
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,100
Now they've been growing at a decent rate for a few months.

232
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,100
Don't count this as something that has happened overnight,

233
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:28,100
but for the first time in the last couple weeks, they've had complete advantage over the competing genres of YouTube.

234
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:33,100
The commentators identified this, but in a brief moment of panic, instead of considering the genre that they were a part of,

235
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:39,100
trending topic commentators favoured individualism and switched over to this content in an attempt to stay afloat.

236
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,100
But it mostly failed. Why? Why did it fail?

237
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:48,100
Well, a few reasons. Firstly, in narrowing their content over the months prior, they had subsequently narrowed their channel's appeal,

238
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,100
and therefore when attempting to branch out, many of the fanbase were disinterested,

239
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:59,100
and if that core fanbase doesn't turn out, then it's very hard to build up the momentum favourable with the aforementioned algorithm that they value so much.

240
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Algorithms aren't just based on topic alone.

241
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,100
Although the content that these creators make do share some common ingredients with reaction,

242
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,100
the fanbase of such is assumedly more mature than the persuasion of many of the reaction channels.

243
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,100
For example, reaction channel Benji recently did a poll of his audience on Twitter,

244
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,100
and although obviously there are methodological flaws with such a poll,

245
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,100
I would still expect it to be somewhat reasonable representation.

246
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,100
And well, the results speak for themselves.

247
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,100
Another huge reason is that the personality of hosts do not suit them.

248
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,100
Whereas reaction channels were energetic and relied on some form of comedy,

249
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,100
trending topics never fully leaned on the comedy.

250
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,100
They relied on the opinion of their host and the trust that they pertain from the audience.

251
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,100
Comedy was just an enhancement to them, it was never a necessity,

252
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:44,100
therefore the fanbase they accumulated was much more on this basis of reason rather than just instant humour.

253
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,100
Instead of railing against this content that their position always seemed above,

254
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:54,100
they tried to get on board with it, essentially killing off any possibility of them criticising it in the future without looking like huge hypocrites.

255
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,100
And make no mistake, I'm not saying that reaction would kill off trending topics,

256
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,100
not even the YouTubers, trending topics will always exist,

257
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,100
but the brand of commentary responding to it is fragile,

258
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,100
and what they've done is hem themselves in.

259
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:10,100
Why would the same audience that watches these people who deride Lele Pons and her contemporaries as not funny

260
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,100
want to see them partake in humour equally as juvenile?

261
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:19,100
Aidan Project's transition from commentary to reaction only worked because of his core fanbase, mostly from Keemstar, wanted it.

262
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:24,100
This may have been possible a year ago when the subjects these channels covered were broader and more diverse,

263
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,100
but the appeal has appeared to converge in the months prior.

264
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,100
Now obviously, when specific topics are trending, this can be to their advantage,

265
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:35,100
as the algorithm recognises a noticeable amount of content and views, and thus rewards it with more views,

266
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:41,100
hence subscribers, such as the Onision situation, in which videos on Onision were garnering more views than actual Onision videos.

267
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,100
However, this also does create subscribers who are there for the topic over the commentator,

268
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:52,100
and once that dried up, it was hard for these YouTubers to mix up their content without disengaging a significant proportion of subscribers.

269
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,100
I often look in the related channels as an indicator of what sort of fanbase these people have,

270
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:02,100
and you might notice the related channels of these reaction commentaries are significantly different to the trending topic commentators.

271
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,100
I'm not saying that proves anything, but it is food for thought.

272
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:13,100
In this new wave of reaction commentary, trending topic commentators found content that was similar enough to compete with them in the commentary subgenre,

273
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,100
but not close enough for them to assimilate to and retain a compelling view count.

274
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,100
For better and for worse, there is a different audience for a lot of these commentators,

275
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:28,100
and even if the topics themselves weren't bad on premise, the expectation of humour that the genre has due to channels like Trigger Tro

276
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:33,100
and such setting it up has essentially given it a brand of what people expect,

277
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:38,100
so even if these trending topic commentators made reaction style videos their own,

278
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:43,100
people probably won't give it the click they need, because they already had that expectation.

279
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,100
To summarise, they were kind of finished before they'd even started.

280
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,100
But what does this all mean in the grand scheme of things?

281
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:52,100
We put out a lot of points, but how do we tie them together in a neat bow?

282
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,100
Well, my friends, let's give it a try.

283
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:03,100
Throughout the last year, content has been discovered that hinges partly on the power of algorithms.

284
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:10,100
The use of meticulous description and tags has enabled many trending topic commentators to cover areas that gives them traction with many fanbases.

285
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:15,100
However, the problem with relying on algorithms alone is that if you fall out of favour with them, then you're screwed.

286
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,100
Many of these creators recognised this and tried to add some personality,

287
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,100
however most of it ended up being overshadowed by the notion of moral righteousness

288
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,100
that simultaneously shielded them from criticism of content a lot of the time

289
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:31,100
and held them out of drama they may have had the opportunity to involve themselves in in the past,

290
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,100
unless it was a clear wrongdoing.

291
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,100
Otherwise, people only seemed to enjoy pointing out hypocrisy and inadequate content

292
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,100
when it was signalled by larger people outside the community,

293
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,100
mainly because of the unification of the smaller community and the domination of certain narratives,

294
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:49,100
to the point that going against these narratives, or the YouTubers that make them, could be seen as blasphemous.

295
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:54,100
In the last few months, the trending topics became very focused and directed at a few people.

296
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,100
This is also okay providing these people continue to appeal to the public,

297
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:03,100
however with the escalation at the peak of the Logan Paul drama, there was an eventual inertia that people stopped watching.

298
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:08,100
In the past, even when the topics weren't trending, the lack of other options for commentary content

299
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,100
would encourage the viewer to check out a trending topic commentator anyway,

300
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,100
even if the subject itself wasn't particularly riveting.

301
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:21,100
However, when the new challenger entered the ring, it perplexed the commentators into trying to integrate their channels into it.

302
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,100
This did not work, as much akin to a KFC opening next to a McDonald's,

303
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,100
although you may face competition the appeal isn't identical.

304
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,100
If you can't see what I'm saying here, commentary is not a tale of death,

305
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,100
it is a tale of survival, and unfortunately when you're surviving and even thriving,

306
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,100
you don't think of all the factors that's keeping your channel alive,

307
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,100
you only realise it when it's gone, or something's wrong.

308
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,100
Trending topics are propped up on multiple other conditions, often beyond their control,

309
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,100
and when these conditions withdraw at once, the effect is felt by many.

310
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,100
This drought will probably pass, and will return to the oasis of trending topics in the future.

311
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,100
Maybe by this time the video's out, we'll be past it all and living it up.

312
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,100
But this was a warning, and I've watched friends and people I admire

313
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,100
put their lives and careers on the line to pursue the YouTube dream,

314
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,100
and the simple truth is that some may not cut it.

315
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,100
Times are changing, content is changing, you have to remember what brought people to your channel,

316
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,100
and what's gonna keep them there, and even if you can keep them there.

317
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,100
From the get-go, commentary channels were stuck between the rock of news channels

318
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:22,100
and the hard place of informational content, and when the walls close in, the pressure shows.

319
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,100
The commentary rat race promoted by algorithms and topics has driven people insane,

320
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,100
trying to keep the news coming even when there isn't any,

321
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,100
and when they ran out of targets, they ran out of ammunition,

322
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,100
creating a dependency and a fear of channel death.

323
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,100
No death is certain, and no death is immediate,

324
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:41,100
but a run of careless decisions and algorithmic exploitation has led us here.

325
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,100
How you respond is your own destiny from here on.

326
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,100
Maybe it'll right itself, maybe we will have to change.

327
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,100
Whatever it does, I hope it succeeds.

328
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,100
There are many prices paid within failure.

329
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,100
I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

330
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,100
Thanks for watching!
