00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,560
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,040
too much free time, and today's topic is something that kinda jumped out on me. In

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,800
what way exactly? Well, it was a fine Saturday morning, I was relaxing, putting my feet up,

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,280
regretting my existence, like every other Saturday morning goes. And then, in a moment

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,800
of spontaneity, I decided to check my Twitter feed. Spontaneity was rewarded because I saw

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,500
no one else but the man himself, Keemstar, sourcing it up with a cheeky little feud with

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:46,020
Marina Joyce of all human beings. Suddenly I had to check my calendar, and make sure

8
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,380
that we weren't back in 2016, because for any of you who have been blessed with not

9
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:56,040
knowing who Marina Joyce is, she is a beauty slash lifestyle vlogger who became monstrously

10
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:01,280
famous for a very brief moment a couple years back. If you blinked, you might have missed

11
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,160
it, but if you had your eyes open, you might have been blinded.

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,060
At the time of the drama, Marina had been doing YouTube for a few years, her channel

13
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,720
was performing okay, but it was nothing particularly special. She had been doing pretty much the

14
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,820
same content since the inception of her channel, mainly her unfiltered personality, trying

15
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,000
to connect with her audiences, some games, some tutorials, and the sort of content that

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,080
would attract fans of a quite innocent demographic. She was very happy, a quirky character who

17
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,680
was definitely not afraid of delivering wholesome messages through the platform, which you know,

18
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,360
sometimes we definitely need more of.

19
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,400
However, all that was to change at the end of July 2016, a few days after she posted

20
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,040
a video known as Date Outfit Ideas, a video that has now accumulated over 43 million views.

21
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,980
Yes, that's more than any episode from the Shane Dawson documentary series, though of

22
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,620
course the video has been out longer, so there's plenty of time for good old Shane

23
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:58,080
here to overtake her. But still, let me indicate how much of a movement this was in the moment.

24
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,940
In one day, she received 35 million views on her channel, that's what we're talking

25
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,040
about here, that can never be ignored.

26
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,900
What was the source of this movement? Well, one we've encountered in the past, one a

27
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,500
mystery. The question of the moment being, what is going on with Marina Joyce? Because

28
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:45,060
in this particular video, Date Outfit Ideas, Marina is seen as being a tad zoned out.

29
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,060
And this is for a brief moment, what threw the internet into a frenzy? A delirium, my

30
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:55,380
friends. And the commentators dashed for their microphones as the journalists reached for

31
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:01,620
their keyboards to document the newest, weirdest internet sensation. People were asking questions,

32
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,940
conspiracy theories were created, was she kidnapped? Was she mentally ill? Was it all

33
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,340
for attention? Even the police were sent to her house to ascertain her wellbeing, although

34
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,780
people were still somewhat suspicious. After all, a lot of her audience knew what she was

35
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,900
normally like, knew her old videos, and her energetic personality, a personality that

36
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,060
had been swapped out for a rather unnerving individual.

37
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,900
However, as mentioned, this was a brief trend, and with Marina withholding the explanation

38
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,980
providing there was of course one, meant that many people quickly lost interest, which is

39
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,740
what leads us to November 2018, when Marina decides to release a video where she talks

40
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:41,220
to haters, in a rather formless video which jumps from one point about the other, and

41
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,580
talks about philosophies that are rather confusing, um, she doesn't like horror movies,

42
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,020
being one of them, which, you know, fair enough. She goes out of the way to express how it's

43
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:56,980
necessary not to reveal the nature of her condition. A debatable, but respectable stance.

44
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,580
Another theme that prevailed throughout the video was how she planned to stay out of drama.

45
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,660
Marina- Drama is not my cup of tea. Drinking tea.

46
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,580
So Marina, being the very anti-drama person, decided that she would maintain this philosophy

47
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,740
by immediately having drama with the most dramatic person in the history of the dramatic

48
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:18,340
world, good old daddy Keem here. You see, after this situation was brought back into

49
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,460
light, Keemstar boldly claimed that the reason all this occurred in the first place was because

50
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:27,160
of drugs, not any specific drugs, and honestly, if this claim was true, it might have been

51
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,980
multiple drugs, for all we know. Now when the initial situation arose, she was very

52
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,940
quiet on the topic, she dismissed the theories, didn't really comment on it, and maybe that

53
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,120
was for the best, maybe it wasn't, we'll debate that in a bit, but this time round

54
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,140
it was different. When Keemstar made these claims, this time round, Marina responded

55
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:49,340
differently, this time outwardly denying that they even had a shred of truth, which ironically

56
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:55,260
caused the truth to be allegedly revealed. Enter stage left, Drew as sharing, a youtuber

57
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,940
weed enthusiastic who smokes weed, yeah he smokes weed, and probably some other drugs

58
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,380
too. Anyhow, he made a video on the topic in response to this little exchange, where

59
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:10,140
he, as a self acclaimed friend of Marina Joyce, supposedly confirms Keemstar's claims that

60
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,340
it was indeed drugs that were the cause of the extremely surreal moments witnessed in

61
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,660
Joyce's videos. Marina then responded again in another video, prolonging this conflict,

62
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:24,940
telling us the real truth, truth after truth after truth, and also promoting Buddhism,

63
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,820
which is good, I think, and yet there was a sentiment of apathy. Sure, there were some

64
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,060
people who were vaguely interested, but barely a fraction of the millions of people who clicked

65
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,400
on Marina Joyce's channel on that fateful July day trying to work out what was going

66
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,100
on in her mind. So, I guess I want this video to be an in-depth retrospective of how the

67
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,380
situation was set up, how it went down, and how much can be said about the culture, because

68
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,500
I do believe there is a level of exceptionalism with regards to what happened, and I think

69
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,300
that it's time we investigated the extremely messy situation that is Marina Joyce, and

70
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,740
see if we can find any affirmative answers to the numerous questions that will inevitably

71
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,200
yield. Are you ready? Well, you don't have a say in this either way, it's my channel

72
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,740
you bellends, let's dive into Marina Joyce.

73
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,260
I think it's important to discuss the culture that Marina Joyce rose from, because generally

74
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,500
there's this impression that Marina Joyce was just this nobody before the whole controversy,

75
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,660
and although she was by no means anyone particularly famous, she had a decent subscriber base,

76
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,980
and at the time, although her channel wasn't experiencing its most fruitful period, she

77
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:31,740
was on the grind, and as creators, we all have good and bad months, so she wasn't wholly

78
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,740
irrelevant, but she was experiencing a bit of a dry spell.

79
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,780
However, I think we have to go back in time, to completely understand the context behind

80
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,080
this. YouTube has come a long way in the space of a decade or so, we have moved from this

81
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,540
small platform where people upload their little camcorder projects where they would go around

82
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,640
and do what humans enjoy doing, to this world where the content created has impressive production

83
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,600
value and many viewers couldn't imagine themselves watching anything less.

84
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,200
It's weird to think that there was a time when many of us settled for that, and that

85
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,480
was the era that Marina Joyce arose from.

86
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,800
Now back in the day, a load of people sitting in their rooms rambling about 10 things that

87
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,580
guys say in romantic relationships intertwined with some odd skit was appealing to a lot

88
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,580
of people.

89
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,240
Admittedly, I honestly can't ever see myself revisiting such content, and I can't really

90
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,780
recall ever watching it in the first place.

91
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,980
And honestly, I don't think many modern audiences can now either, but people still

92
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,180
did, and I think that was mainly due to the realism of it all.

93
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,400
I don't think that back then children were more easily satisfied necessarily, I just

94
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,500
think that everything is relative, and we were enamoured by the new developments on

95
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,260
the internet, it all felt like a step forward for us plebeians.

96
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:44,160
At that point you might ask, well why didn't people just switch on the TV to see something

97
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,820
that was better made, after all, YouTube feels like it went down that route of recent for

98
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,360
that exact reason.

99
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,240
You know, increasing those production values to compete with the TV, but returning to my

100
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,560
previous point, I think that YouTube would always have something that TV will never have,

101
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,200
unless they set up a cable channel for the commentary community of course, and in my

102
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,740
opinion that's just the earnest involvement of audiences.

103
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,840
You always feel like you're part of something a bit more significant than just observing

104
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,240
the old television.

105
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,400
The reason that I think these bedroom style vlogs were appreciated above anything else

106
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:21,120
is because the style was undeniably unique, and people valued that over any nice, sharp

107
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
production.

108
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,480
This is the sort of environment that Marina thrived in, she came across as a very stereotypical

109
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,800
teenage girl, the sort of person who was on one hand very lively and happy towards her

110
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,000
audience, bursting into moments of spontaneity that would reflect a quirky personality.

111
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:43,400
So, you know, just making this quick vlog, that, whatever, um, yeah, going to Marble Arch, woo, meetups, woo!

112
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,240
Content that, although not laugh out loud funny, would endear a particular demographic,

113
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,460
she'd talk about anything she cared about, and on top of that, there were videos that

114
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,940
gave her a bit more depth than the average bedroom blogger.

115
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:01,020
She was prepared to battle narratives, I mean, Nice Guys Don't Finish Last is the original

116
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,640
incel rebuttal as far as I'm concerned.

117
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:10,700
Nice Guys Do Not Finish Last, to be honest, including myself, I'm pretty sure a girl will

118
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:17,160
prefer to have a guy that treats her right, and if they don't, then you are looking at the wrong girl.

119
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,200
Marina Joyce destroys Nice Guy narrative with facts and logic.

120
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,000
Anyhow, I think it was this nature to tackle some of the more sensitive topics, I mean,

121
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,500
topics that were considered sensitive then at least, which definitely helped her maintain

122
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,800
the fanbase, but they weren't the main reason she blew up.

123
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,780
No, ever since YouTube's deactivation of the statistics tab, one of the worst things

124
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,580
those bastards did, we've been using the way Bat Machine on The Right Opinion to find

125
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:45,040
out exactly what was popping at the time, and actually it was her beauty videos that

126
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,060
appeared to gain the most traction, initially it was her eyelash tutorial video, after all,

127
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,480
one thing identifiable with her old videos were her eyelashes.

128
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,720
However whereas some channels may capitalise on this, she appeared to choose to consolidate

129
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,540
her position with videos that were more focused around herself, which has advantages and disadvantages.

130
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,520
On one hand you're missing out on an opportunity to make more videos like those and gain a

131
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,300
load of subscribers, but on the other hand you're organically creating a connection

132
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:16,260
with the audience, an audience who are more likely to stick around with you in the hard times.

133
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:21,260
This is important to remember for later, Marina definitely had a core dedicated fanbase, even

134
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,160
though she wasn't incredibly different from a lot of her competitors at the time, she

135
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,120
But the times they were a changing, you see bringing back the earlier point, although

136
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,640
there was definitely an appeal within her personality, production values all around

137
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,520
the platform were improving, however in the past, whereas having a nice attractive style

138
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,760
was seen as a sacrifice of the genuine down to earth character, people were expanding

139
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,460
in ways that they could essentially settle on both.

140
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,880
As technology became more mainstream, no longer did having a good impressive camera compromise

141
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,520
the boy or girl next door nature, these things were becoming normalised.

142
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,320
Creators needed to evolve, Marina on the other hand, who created a weird dynamic, despite

143
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,380
her tutorial videos being the most successful, she mostly focused on herself as a person,

144
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,120
almost overwhelmingly actually.

145
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,220
This tells me that I don't really think Marina was looking for relevance at this stage

146
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,620
in her career, but that was a lot of the YouTube mentality back then, many people just saw

147
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,100
the platform as an outlet for themselves, that was perfectly natural.

148
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,260
A lot of people might be mistaken to think that all of Marina's videos blew up because

149
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:30,520
of what happened in 2016, however it's clear that some of Marina's videos just had a habit

150
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,940
of deciding they were going to do the numbers, and this is essentially what created an audience

151
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,940
for her.

152
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,940
It was much more the challenges and the topics, and her personality, although fairly innocent,

153
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,420
didn't really keep a huge subscriber base coming back, not that she appeared to care

154
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,740
all that much, she was happy doing something that she was doing, with at least a somewhat

155
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,740
committed fanbase.

156
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:55,620
As said, the landscape of YouTube and content creation was changing very rapidly, we were

157
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,780
slowly raising the bar of the acceptable standard for many production values.

158
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,300
One thing that I found very interesting is that although Marina seemed to improve her

159
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,680
style in some ways, she carried through a lot of the quirky energy that she had always

160
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,420
portrayed to her audience.

161
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,920
I watched the Draw My Life video, and it was very endearing in documenting the struggles

162
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,820
that she faced, however I noticed that it used the exact same music as the music in

163
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:23,500
the fateful video that caused this phenomenon, despite having over 3 years between them.

164
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,260
Hi, my name's Marina, and I'm 16.

165
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:32,460
I was a little girl with long blonde hair and blue eyes, and I was always extremely

166
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,460
short.

167
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,460
My hair reached my bum.

168
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,460
That was fun.

169
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:40,260
Hey guys, so today I'm advertising Style U, and I'm advertising their clothes, so this

170
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,900
is me just advertising their clothes, and yeah, I love you guys so much.

171
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,020
It seems that Marina wasn't really changing that much as a creator, and normally this

172
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:52,600
wouldn't be a problem, but equally it meant that as a character, she began to stand out

173
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,400
even more and more in a changing landscape that had its presentation a lot more organised,

174
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
and to the point.

175
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:04,120
The sort of overly energetic, chaotic people were being replaced by people who were charismatic

176
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,180
in their own rights, but certainly not to that level.

177
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,520
Her character was always somewhat unique, her character always had its quirks, and with

178
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,020
this it made it even more distinct.

179
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,040
Not in a bad way or anything, but you'll see exactly why this matters with what we're

180
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,260
discussing next.

181
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:31,140
Now I personally think that Drew may well be possibly being very honest in his video,

182
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:35,180
and we might discuss his position a bit more towards the end, however I do not want to

183
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,940
premise his video as truth, as it's an extremely sensitive topic, and Marina has her own side

184
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:45,340
that she has presented indirectly in rebuttal, which we will also discuss later as well.

185
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,500
We don't need it to evaluate a lot of the culture surrounding the whole incident, people

186
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,780
didn't know then and yet we still witnessed a huge frenzy in theories and thoughts, whatever

187
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,140
happened happened, we can look at that.

188
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,020
In the previous part we discussed a lot of various theories and concepts that on their

189
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:04,580
own aren't particularly important, but as a combination created a situation like no

190
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:09,420
other, and the job of this is to visit it and apply everything we know thus far, and

191
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,740
put the pieces of the puzzle together before analysing it further.

192
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,420
Marina Joyce is a spiritual person, Marina Joyce is a person who is quite out there,

193
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,940
you can tell this from her videos, you can tell this from her tweets, I think that's

194
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,100
really important to note.

195
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,500
I had a dream that God said he liked my skirt so I wore it today.

196
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,420
These things don't just help build a persona, but they can really create a snowball effect

197
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,860
when a particular situation goes down.

198
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:38,100
One of the very identifiable elements of the Marina situation was that as a person, despite

199
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:43,300
aging significantly since her first video, her mental outlook was still one of purity,

200
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,340
one of innocence, and it takes a lot of energy to keep up that persona.

201
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:51,340
For many people, her mood is not a default, I know it's certainly not for me because

202
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:55,700
I'm a miserable bastard, but it's not hard to be that, not from my perspective at

203
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,700
least.

204
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,500
So when I look at someone like Marina, I think to myself, how much effort goes into being

205
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,500
that happy?

206
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,460
Well obviously, maybe it's not effort for her, maybe she just thinks like that, but

207
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,100
because it's so out of the ordinary, from my perspective, it becomes identifiable when

208
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:14,420
that mood has shifted, because it takes a positive effort to create that, and that's

209
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,140
what happened with Marina Joyce.

210
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:21,780
She carved out a distinctive character that perceptibly took effort, that when she started

211
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:27,140
behaving in a way that was not typically associated with her image, it became very clear.

212
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:31,420
Now the video that vaulted her into stardom was Date Outfit Ideas, however going back

213
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:49,320
you can see that it was evident throughout the videos before.

214
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,560
Many people pointed out that it seems she just had these moments where it looks like

215
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,220
she had some sort of Vietnam flashback, the very jolting transition from her modelling

216
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,280
to the point where she'd have a horrified look on her face.

217
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,640
And if you know her older videos, and her original videos, you can tell that her behaviour

218
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,240
throughout the whole situation isn't a momentary thing.

219
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,820
Those particular instances may accentuate that, but equally by watching her videos prior

220
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:17,800
to all this transpiring, you can tell that all these videos are off in their delivery.

221
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,000
She always had a bit of a muted approach to delivering sentences and so on, but the way

222
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,280
she talks is extremely stilted and disconnected in these particular videos, and it's extremely

223
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,280
noticeable.

224
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,480
Plenty of people have had spells like that in their content that have been overlooked,

225
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,300
even people who have been happy themselves, we all have rough times.

226
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,800
Why would this cause so much chaos, when really it's just a person acting out of the ordinary?

227
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,860
Well it starts with a fanbase, Marina Joyce by 2016 had a channel that wasn't really

228
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:51,560
growing, was moving at a fairly stately pace, but she still had a continuous dedicated audience

229
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,200
who knew her personality well, that's important, as mentioned while standing out amongst the

230
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,880
culture she was also familiar with her own viewers, and this creates a juxtaposition

231
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,640
that will pinpoint any shifts in her behaviour.

232
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,360
Marina's persona is consistently happy, and her fans know that.

233
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,800
Of course she'll deal with more serious topics, but I watched a lot of old Marina

234
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,040
Joyce videos and every single one of them felt like they had a tone, with very little

235
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,640
fluctuation in mood, and ones that did felt natural.

236
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,960
I would liken the instant of Marina Joyce to the idea of climate and weather, whereas

237
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,380
weather might simply describe the sort of state of an environment at a specific time

238
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:33,000
or place, climate represents a greater trend, a long term outlook, which is why we care

239
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,780
about climate change rather than weather change.

240
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,980
As mentioned earlier, the video that caused all the distress was not one, was not the

241
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,660
first one where she was acting strangely, in fact she was clearly acting strangely in

242
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,520
multiple videos prior.

243
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,520
Difference is that this video was probably the one that dictated the trend, the one that

244
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,280
told us that this is going in a direction, and one that we probably don't want it to

245
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
go in.

246
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,720
I don't know exactly how it started, I don't know exactly when it began, but it was almost

247
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,240
certainly amplified by fans who knew that something wasn't quite right, it was not

248
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,160
the Marina Joyce that they knew.

249
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,480
Equally what was mildly concerning was the actual conflict of the messages that Marina

250
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,560
sent off, I've recorded videos when I've been happy, I've recorded videos when I've

251
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:20,600
been in very dark places, the one thing that I will never try to do is miss sell my mood.

252
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,740
Marina seemed like she was trying to recapture that positive vibe that all her viewers were

253
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,400
familiar with, but it just wasn't clicking.

254
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,000
Also keep note of the fact that she would regularly use the same music from a few years

255
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,400
back and would hold on to these traditions in her production, and with this, it felt

256
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,440
unnerving in the context with her out of place behaviour, it's like she didn't even know

257
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,480
she was behaving strangely, it became very weird.

258
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,480
Even the date outfit video when she decided to do that twirl, it's almost as if when she

259
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,880
turned away from the camera, she switched off, and then when she'd finished turning,

260
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,440
she'd got to switch back on.

261
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,680
Any fan of Marina's would know that the whole video, even when she was smiling, felt

262
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,600
uncomfortable and forced, yet it was these moments that helped add another layer that

263
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,200
concerned the casual viewer as well, whereas fans would notice the long term changes, casuals

264
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,520
would notice the volatile short term ticks, from the first days of her channel, this tone

265
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,900
had created a character, and suddenly it was being torn down, and you had a backlog

266
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,760
of content to compare it to.

267
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,640
With that backlog came a person who made us feel involved, a person whose life we saw

268
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,620
in close quarters, as mentioned earlier, unlike TV drama, people felt like they were part

269
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:30,180
of this person's life much more, that intimate relationship finally mobilised a group of

270
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,880
people who felt like they had influence, and they did.

271
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,060
This was a swell of attention that felt galvanised, but that's still not the whole story, because

272
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:43,460
as intriguing a character study as this is, it needed one more component to create the

273
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:48,940
full on hysteria that we witnessed over those few days, and the final spicy saucy ingredient

274
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,200
were the conspiracy theories, and not just any old conspiracy theories, because as plausible

275
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,620
as the ideas such as drugs, attention, or even a mental disorder were, plausibility

276
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:03,020
doesn't mean fun, and as mentioned before, people love chaos and mystery, and this was

277
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,320
epitomised by the kidnapping theory.

278
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,640
The kidnapping theory really did deserve some credit for keeping this in the public

279
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,640
mind.

280
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,280
Marina Joyce is an established creator, she's behaving extremely strangely, and she appears

281
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,920
to lapse into moments of terror and anguish, and some of these YouTubers come round asking

282
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,960
if she's been kidnapped with very interesting evidence.

283
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,720
In a recent Q&A video she made, someone asks her a question which prompts her to jump multiple

284
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,720
times.

285
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:49,560
And as she does this, a sound of what sounds like a chain is heard.

286
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,140
Those are some pretty light chains, mate.

287
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,760
Though some of the video was a bit more plausible, that bit is very questionable.

288
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,040
It's a strange theory, the thought that a kidnapper would allow their freshly abducted

289
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:06,920
victims to broadcast on YouTube is absolutely absurd, but at the same time, people love

290
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,600
the fun that the mystery can provoke, and with the hashtag SaveMarinaJoyce movement,

291
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,040
this all went viral.

292
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,660
Really it was the dark edge this situation had above all, the bruises, the fear.

293
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,760
It was scary, but it was stimulating for people.

294
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,960
Suddenly you have this unique amalgamation of so many different factors, with so much

295
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,960
history creating this movement that fired everyone up, thinking about how Marina Joyce

296
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,680
needs to be saved, the danger that she was in.

297
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,800
Who will rescue Marina Joyce?

298
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,440
Well who did?

299
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:46,800
You see, earlier on I said that Marina Joyce had a tendency to avoid capitalising on her

300
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:52,360
successful content, and although this is more notoriety than success, the views were still

301
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,360
excellent.

302
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,120
However, she once again evaded any comment on what was going on specifically.

303
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,000
Now Marina has admitted herself that regardless of the truth, she was not in a good place

304
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,200
in that moment, however at the time she was rather dismissive of the claims being put

305
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,040
forward towards her by many content creators.

306
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,280
Therefore regardless of what it is, that's why I don't think she did this for attention,

307
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,120
she clearly doesn't view YouTube on such a basis, she never intended to be that infamous,

308
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,880
and when it happened she almost let it die herself.

309
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,000
Of course she went on some interviews which provided her with extra publicity, but even

310
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,160
then they were mostly done with the purpose of playing down a lot of the theories put

311
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,160
forward against her.

312
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,600
I'm not taking drugs, I would never do that, and mainly because of my viewers, and I really

313
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,760
care about my viewers, so that's the reason why I wouldn't take drugs.

314
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,080
And like, that I go to drug free events, like I go to raves, but like the raves that I'm

315
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,880
going through are the drug free raves, they're not tolerated, like the places that I go to

316
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,280
aren't places where you can do those sort of things.

317
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:19,560
So I think people get confused by what I'm doing in my life, where by not knowing me

318
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:25,960
as well as they should, but yeah, I don't take drugs because I think that it's really

319
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:33,080
unhealthy for you, and I understand like, just like, I know what happens to those kind

320
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,800
of people, and it's just very dangerous for you, it can give you mental health issues

321
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,920
and stuff like that, it's not good for you, so I just don't recommend it to anybody, and

322
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,200
I just wouldn't do that myself.

323
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,720
Have you ever done anything like that?

324
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,280
Not the most persuasive explanation, but still, it seems that she wasn't interested

325
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,120
in milking this instant for what it was, she was a committed YouTuber, as a creator, with

326
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:02,680
a small but resolute core fanbase, she wanted to stick to what she knew, if she'd gone

327
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,040
down the route of talking about the real reason why she was doing all the things she was doing,

328
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,280
she may have caught the attention of the recent million or so new fans, but she may have done

329
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:16,080
that at the sacrifice of her committed fans, who would then be faced with a different perception

330
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,760
of a person who they had formerly had such a clear image of, this consistent character,

331
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,020
that even after the interviews, even after the admission that she wasn't exactly doing

332
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:31,040
so well, that was still maintained, or attempted to be maintained through the persona, and

333
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,720
so it's clear that although at the time she wasn't being completely honest, and

334
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,660
people may have been frustrated at the fact that she wasn't giving clear explanations,

335
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:44,160
maybe it was for the best, considering the context of it all, a small proportion of the

336
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,800
people who subscribed to her during the peak of the drama, did actually stick around and

337
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:52,420
provide her with additional traffic, but typically that considered over questioning her attitude,

338
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:57,320
which in my opinion, came through as her trying to rekindle that old spirit that she had before

339
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,800
the incident, and honestly, I think people were looking too much at that with a critical

340
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,260
eye, she was always a bit saccharine, she was always a bit over the top, she's just

341
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:11,140
trying to get that again, the whole incident said a lot about how mystery drives the culture

342
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:15,540
of concern, once people kinda felt like there was nothing left to see, they just kinda moved

343
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:20,360
on, I doubt many of the people who partook in the Saving Marina Joyce hashtag even gave

344
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,140
her channel a second look, which is probably why she's lumbering around now with a load

345
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:29,040
of dead subscribers, however, although the nihilist approach is easy and obvious in this

346
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,940
circumstance, and there is a cynical narrative that can be created, I think that the Saving

347
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:38,540
Marina Joyce hashtag was actually a positive movement for once, and I think that came down

348
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:44,040
to the presentation, typically movement sensationalising someone's suffering often amplifies the struggle

349
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,540
that they may be encountering, exposing them to a media onslaught when really what they

350
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:53,640
need is some therapy, it's not particularly helpful, and so on the surface I'd be poised

351
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,700
to criticise this movement as another media treatment of someone that's clearly beyond

352
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,100
our understanding, however, the framing of Saving Marina Joyce actually put a pretty

353
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:07,620
positive spin on it, on one hand it did amplify what she was encountering to the outside world,

354
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:12,280
but whereas sometimes a creator faces the brunt of all this, the tone of concern was

355
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,860
one that almost pushed a sentiment of worry onto Marina, that made her feel responsible

356
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:22,540
for all these people caring, and actually gave her the motivation to change, because

357
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,620
people wanted to see her well, and not like this.

358
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:29,800
When we experience hard times, I think that one of the driving elements that may cause

359
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,520
us to do things that are irresponsible is the idea that no one cares about the consequences

360
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,940
of what we do to ourselves, I've done stupid things for that reason, the thought that no

361
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,360
one cares about you, I mean, the thought that no one cares about you, I mean why should

362
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,120
you look after yourself? The power of the Saving Marina Joyce movement was that it wasn't

363
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:53,040
driven by vitriol, nor by anger, but actual care, the idea that there were people who

364
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:58,600
cared about Marina Joyce and her wellbeing, and suddenly she felt the necessity to actually

365
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,220
improve, and I feel that's sometimes what lacks in a lot of internet movements, actual

366
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,980
care for what is right, and remembering that at the other side, there are human beings

367
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:12,380
as well, Saving Marina Joyce actually encompassed some of the best of internet movements, and

368
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,340
the thought that you can actually pull someone back from the edge, is kinda heartwarming,

369
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,660
and Marina even acknowledges that herself.

370
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:23,540
Marina Joyce- But honestly, even though people seemed to make it out like they cared, I never

371
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:27,980
really got the full support that I deserved from those people, I didn't get proper help

372
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,900
from anyone, Saving Marina Joyce made me realise that I needed to change some things in my

373
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:38,060
life to make my life a lot happier, safer, and healthier, because I was in danger in

374
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:42,740
a lot of different ways, and that was the truth, so it's kinda not a joke when you say

375
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:47,520
help me, because I was actually in danger, and I actually went through a lot of physical

376
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,580
pain as well, as well as emotional pain.

377
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:53,420
Jack- Who knows what might have happened if people didn't intervene, and so when this

378
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:58,140
latest drama went down, it kinda put a sour taste in my mouth, why couldn't we have a

379
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,380
nice peaceful resolution, with the idea that there is some kind of positive closure, why

380
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,800
was it necessary to have this twitter flame war, and then the video where Marina attacks

381
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:11,980
Keemstar for 12 minutes with her boyfriend, which you know, people can say what they want,

382
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:15,560
but it was a bit of an aimless rant, if you wanna expose someone, you need to have a bit

383
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:21,100
more structure, it felt antithetical to everything that Marina had been promoting in her previous

384
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:25,460
content, and ironically it felt like for the first time she was willingly breaking out

385
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,100
of her normal positive persona.

386
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:32,300
Keem- What is up Drama Alert nation, I'm your host, Killer Keemstar.

387
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,300
Marina- SHUT UP!

388
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:38,320
Jack- The thing about Keem's comments is that he was theorising, that's what Keem does,

389
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,220
you can only really lie when you know the truth, even if he was right, even if he was

390
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:48,660
wrong, he wasn't wilfully lying, he's provided what he thinks happened, now you can say that's

391
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,960
distasteful given the context of the situation, and I might even be inclined to agree with

392
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,480
you, but when you leave the explanation very open ended, that's what's going to happen,

393
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,560
people are going to make up theories and ideas of what's occurred to try and rationalise

394
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,760
the situation, and that's what motivated this situation in the first place, for better

395
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,440
and for worse, no one is entitled to an explanation, but if you don't give them one, they're gonna

396
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,600
take guesses.

397
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,080
It's fair to say that Marina did remove this video subsequently, saying that she would

398
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,600
not stoop down to Keem's level, whatever the reason, it was probably for the best.

399
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,920
When Drew's video came out, I was also left feeling rather conflicted, on one hand, it

400
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,680
did somewhat bring closure to a lot of the questions surrounding her life and provided

401
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,600
an explanation, however given the fact that the premise that Marina was calling Keemstar

402
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,160
a liar on was inherently faulty, it meant that that premise really needed correction

403
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,980
rather than the actual situation, and it's not like she hadn't dismissed the claims made

404
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,920
in other videos in the past, not specifically like with Keemstar, but still none the less.

405
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:59,040
Marina has been evasive on it from the start, and to be honest I don't entirely blame her,

406
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,120
and so in this instance I still feel that maybe it was Marina's story to tell, though

407
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,840
obviously it's relieving that there's a bit of clarity.

408
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,360
Now of course she has released videos talking about her truth, the newest one that I'm going

409
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,920
to have to include in post-editing as she decided to respond to allegations again, emphasising

410
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:24,600
her use of medication, but she was equally aversive in the video, and given the amount

411
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,800
of contradicting accounts it's hard to believe that a high dose of medication is the complete

412
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,000
explanation, especially given some of the more audacious incidents, however that's

413
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,200
her explanation, take it or leave it.

414
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,560
However I would encourage Marina to leave it behind, let it go, don't let it be everything

415
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,700
that defines you, making numerous videos on how you don't want to talk about it seems

416
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,440
rather contradictory.

417
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,280
And to be honest, we probably won't ever hear Marina's full story, because the only

418
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,400
person who knows the full truth is Marina herself, and if you don't want to talk about

419
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,600
your experiences, then you don't have to, but what we do know is that Marina's story

420
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,500
is embedded in a culture, one that was born out of the bedroom era and yet evolved into

421
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:07,020
something so much weirder, where many people moved forward in their style catering to their

422
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:11,500
ever changing audiences, Marina provided a capsule of the content that she originated

423
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,540
from, maintaining the upbeat music and the saccharine tone, to the point where, when

424
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:20,580
that evaporated, it was such a ground shaking departure that it began a movement that no

425
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,260
one could have ever anticipated the size of.

426
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,220
Equally, there are many positives to take away from it, and although the recent conflict

427
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:31,980
has maybe put an atmosphere of cynicism over the situation, one in which parties involved

428
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:36,220
should know better, I hope that maybe we can look on the bright side of it and say, I guess

429
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,260
everyone was alright in the end.

430
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:42,140
Because isn't that what matters?

431
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,780
No.

432
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,660
What matters is where the hell that Peruvian temple is.

433
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,260
I donated good money for that you piece of-

434
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,720
So there is the video my friends.

435
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,500
I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments below.

436
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,340
What do you think of the Marina Joy situation, if you remember it?

437
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,660
Well hopefully I've jogged your memory at least.

438
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:01,960
I'd also like to give a big shout out to the editors, they do a fantastic job.

439
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,620
These videos would not be here without them, and the progress that they have helped me

440
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,620
make is incredible.

441
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,820
So please, I'm gonna leave their links in the description below, if you have the time

442
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:15,060
go and check them out, send them some love, they really do deserve it.

443
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:19,980
Also I want to give a big thanks to my Patreons, the generosity is really appreciated, I've

444
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:24,420
got a few of them on screen right now, they have done a fantastic service, much appreciated,

445
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,880
I love you guys, you really do mean a lot.

446
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,220
And the one individual Patreon I have to give credit to is Ryan, who is still donating $100

447
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:37,380
a month, and I do not know why anyone would do that, but thank you man, it really does

448
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,380
mean a lot.

449
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,380
I love you.

450
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:44,260
No homo, unless you want it to be homo, but then, you know, it's up to you, whatever.

451
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:47,780
Anyhow, I don't really think there's too much else to say, thanks again for the support,

452
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:52,580
it means a lot, I love you guys, and hopefully by the time this gets out, we'll be having

453
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,940
a good time on the channel.

454
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,300
Until then however, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

455
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,380
I'll see you guys in the next one.

456
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:08,880
Bye!
