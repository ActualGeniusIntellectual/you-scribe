0	9560	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
9560	14040	too much free time, and today's topic is something that kinda jumped out on me. In
14040	19800	what way exactly? Well, it was a fine Saturday morning, I was relaxing, putting my feet up,
19800	24280	regretting my existence, like every other Saturday morning goes. And then, in a moment
24280	29800	of spontaneity, I decided to check my Twitter feed. Spontaneity was rewarded because I saw
29800	35500	no one else but the man himself, Keemstar, sourcing it up with a cheeky little feud with
35500	46020	Marina Joyce of all human beings. Suddenly I had to check my calendar, and make sure
46020	51380	that we weren't back in 2016, because for any of you who have been blessed with not
51380	56040	knowing who Marina Joyce is, she is a beauty slash lifestyle vlogger who became monstrously
56040	61280	famous for a very brief moment a couple years back. If you blinked, you might have missed
61280	64160	it, but if you had your eyes open, you might have been blinded.
64160	68060	At the time of the drama, Marina had been doing YouTube for a few years, her channel
68060	72720	was performing okay, but it was nothing particularly special. She had been doing pretty much the
72720	77820	same content since the inception of her channel, mainly her unfiltered personality, trying
77820	82000	to connect with her audiences, some games, some tutorials, and the sort of content that
82000	87080	would attract fans of a quite innocent demographic. She was very happy, a quirky character who
87080	91680	was definitely not afraid of delivering wholesome messages through the platform, which you know,
91680	93360	sometimes we definitely need more of.
93360	98400	However, all that was to change at the end of July 2016, a few days after she posted
98400	105040	a video known as Date Outfit Ideas, a video that has now accumulated over 43 million views.
105040	108980	Yes, that's more than any episode from the Shane Dawson documentary series, though of
108980	112620	course the video has been out longer, so there's plenty of time for good old Shane
112620	118080	here to overtake her. But still, let me indicate how much of a movement this was in the moment.
118080	122940	In one day, she received 35 million views on her channel, that's what we're talking
122940	126040	about here, that can never be ignored.
126040	130900	What was the source of this movement? Well, one we've encountered in the past, one a
130900	135500	mystery. The question of the moment being, what is going on with Marina Joyce? Because
135500	165060	in this particular video, Date Outfit Ideas, Marina is seen as being a tad zoned out.
165060	170060	And this is for a brief moment, what threw the internet into a frenzy? A delirium, my
170060	175380	friends. And the commentators dashed for their microphones as the journalists reached for
175380	181620	their keyboards to document the newest, weirdest internet sensation. People were asking questions,
181620	185940	conspiracy theories were created, was she kidnapped? Was she mentally ill? Was it all
185940	190340	for attention? Even the police were sent to her house to ascertain her wellbeing, although
190340	194780	people were still somewhat suspicious. After all, a lot of her audience knew what she was
194780	199900	normally like, knew her old videos, and her energetic personality, a personality that
199900	203060	had been swapped out for a rather unnerving individual.
203060	207900	However, as mentioned, this was a brief trend, and with Marina withholding the explanation
207900	211980	providing there was of course one, meant that many people quickly lost interest, which is
211980	216740	what leads us to November 2018, when Marina decides to release a video where she talks
216740	221220	to haters, in a rather formless video which jumps from one point about the other, and
221220	225580	talks about philosophies that are rather confusing, um, she doesn't like horror movies,
225580	230020	being one of them, which, you know, fair enough. She goes out of the way to express how it's
230020	236980	necessary not to reveal the nature of her condition. A debatable, but respectable stance.
236980	240580	Another theme that prevailed throughout the video was how she planned to stay out of drama.
240580	244660	Marina- Drama is not my cup of tea. Drinking tea.
244660	249580	So Marina, being the very anti-drama person, decided that she would maintain this philosophy
249580	253740	by immediately having drama with the most dramatic person in the history of the dramatic
253740	258340	world, good old daddy Keem here. You see, after this situation was brought back into
258340	262460	light, Keemstar boldly claimed that the reason all this occurred in the first place was because
262460	267160	of drugs, not any specific drugs, and honestly, if this claim was true, it might have been
267160	270980	multiple drugs, for all we know. Now when the initial situation arose, she was very
270980	275940	quiet on the topic, she dismissed the theories, didn't really comment on it, and maybe that
275940	280120	was for the best, maybe it wasn't, we'll debate that in a bit, but this time round
280120	284140	it was different. When Keemstar made these claims, this time round, Marina responded
284140	289340	differently, this time outwardly denying that they even had a shred of truth, which ironically
289340	295260	caused the truth to be allegedly revealed. Enter stage left, Drew as sharing, a youtuber
295260	299940	weed enthusiastic who smokes weed, yeah he smokes weed, and probably some other drugs
299940	304380	too. Anyhow, he made a video on the topic in response to this little exchange, where
304380	310140	he, as a self acclaimed friend of Marina Joyce, supposedly confirms Keemstar's claims that
310140	314340	it was indeed drugs that were the cause of the extremely surreal moments witnessed in
314340	319660	Joyce's videos. Marina then responded again in another video, prolonging this conflict,
319660	324940	telling us the real truth, truth after truth after truth, and also promoting Buddhism,
324940	329820	which is good, I think, and yet there was a sentiment of apathy. Sure, there were some
329820	334060	people who were vaguely interested, but barely a fraction of the millions of people who clicked
334060	338400	on Marina Joyce's channel on that fateful July day trying to work out what was going
338400	343100	on in her mind. So, I guess I want this video to be an in-depth retrospective of how the
343100	347380	situation was set up, how it went down, and how much can be said about the culture, because
347380	351500	I do believe there is a level of exceptionalism with regards to what happened, and I think
351500	356300	that it's time we investigated the extremely messy situation that is Marina Joyce, and
356300	360740	see if we can find any affirmative answers to the numerous questions that will inevitably
360740	365200	yield. Are you ready? Well, you don't have a say in this either way, it's my channel
365200	369740	you bellends, let's dive into Marina Joyce.
369740	374260	I think it's important to discuss the culture that Marina Joyce rose from, because generally
374260	378500	there's this impression that Marina Joyce was just this nobody before the whole controversy,
378500	382660	and although she was by no means anyone particularly famous, she had a decent subscriber base,
382660	386980	and at the time, although her channel wasn't experiencing its most fruitful period, she
386980	391740	was on the grind, and as creators, we all have good and bad months, so she wasn't wholly
391740	394740	irrelevant, but she was experiencing a bit of a dry spell.
394740	398780	However, I think we have to go back in time, to completely understand the context behind
398780	403080	this. YouTube has come a long way in the space of a decade or so, we have moved from this
403080	407540	small platform where people upload their little camcorder projects where they would go around
407540	412640	and do what humans enjoy doing, to this world where the content created has impressive production
412640	416600	value and many viewers couldn't imagine themselves watching anything less.
416600	421200	It's weird to think that there was a time when many of us settled for that, and that
421200	423480	was the era that Marina Joyce arose from.
423480	427800	Now back in the day, a load of people sitting in their rooms rambling about 10 things that
427800	432580	guys say in romantic relationships intertwined with some odd skit was appealing to a lot
432580	433580	of people.
433580	438240	Admittedly, I honestly can't ever see myself revisiting such content, and I can't really
438240	440780	recall ever watching it in the first place.
440780	444980	And honestly, I don't think many modern audiences can now either, but people still
444980	448180	did, and I think that was mainly due to the realism of it all.
448180	452400	I don't think that back then children were more easily satisfied necessarily, I just
452400	456500	think that everything is relative, and we were enamoured by the new developments on
456500	460260	the internet, it all felt like a step forward for us plebeians.
460260	464160	At that point you might ask, well why didn't people just switch on the TV to see something
464160	468820	that was better made, after all, YouTube feels like it went down that route of recent for
468820	470360	that exact reason.
470440	474240	You know, increasing those production values to compete with the TV, but returning to my
474240	478560	previous point, I think that YouTube would always have something that TV will never have,
478560	482200	unless they set up a cable channel for the commentary community of course, and in my
482200	485740	opinion that's just the earnest involvement of audiences.
485740	489840	You always feel like you're part of something a bit more significant than just observing
489840	491240	the old television.
491240	495400	The reason that I think these bedroom style vlogs were appreciated above anything else
495400	501120	is because the style was undeniably unique, and people valued that over any nice, sharp
501120	502120	production.
502120	506480	This is the sort of environment that Marina thrived in, she came across as a very stereotypical
506480	510800	teenage girl, the sort of person who was on one hand very lively and happy towards her
510800	515000	audience, bursting into moments of spontaneity that would reflect a quirky personality.
515000	523400	So, you know, just making this quick vlog, that, whatever, um, yeah, going to Marble Arch, woo, meetups, woo!
523400	528240	Content that, although not laugh out loud funny, would endear a particular demographic,
528240	532460	she'd talk about anything she cared about, and on top of that, there were videos that
532460	535940	gave her a bit more depth than the average bedroom blogger.
535940	541020	She was prepared to battle narratives, I mean, Nice Guys Don't Finish Last is the original
541020	543640	incel rebuttal as far as I'm concerned.
543640	550700	Nice Guys Do Not Finish Last, to be honest, including myself, I'm pretty sure a girl will
550700	557160	prefer to have a guy that treats her right, and if they don't, then you are looking at the wrong girl.
557160	561200	Marina Joyce destroys Nice Guy narrative with facts and logic.
561200	566000	Anyhow, I think it was this nature to tackle some of the more sensitive topics, I mean,
566000	569500	topics that were considered sensitive then at least, which definitely helped her maintain
569500	572800	the fanbase, but they weren't the main reason she blew up.
572800	576780	No, ever since YouTube's deactivation of the statistics tab, one of the worst things
576780	580580	those bastards did, we've been using the way Bat Machine on The Right Opinion to find
580580	585040	out exactly what was popping at the time, and actually it was her beauty videos that
585040	590060	appeared to gain the most traction, initially it was her eyelash tutorial video, after all,
590060	593480	one thing identifiable with her old videos were her eyelashes.
593480	597720	However whereas some channels may capitalise on this, she appeared to choose to consolidate
597720	603540	her position with videos that were more focused around herself, which has advantages and disadvantages.
603540	607520	On one hand you're missing out on an opportunity to make more videos like those and gain a
607520	611300	load of subscribers, but on the other hand you're organically creating a connection
611300	616260	with the audience, an audience who are more likely to stick around with you in the hard times.
616260	621260	This is important to remember for later, Marina definitely had a core dedicated fanbase, even
621260	625160	though she wasn't incredibly different from a lot of her competitors at the time, she
626160	630120	But the times they were a changing, you see bringing back the earlier point, although
630120	634640	there was definitely an appeal within her personality, production values all around
634640	639520	the platform were improving, however in the past, whereas having a nice attractive style
639520	643760	was seen as a sacrifice of the genuine down to earth character, people were expanding
643760	646460	in ways that they could essentially settle on both.
646460	651880	As technology became more mainstream, no longer did having a good impressive camera compromise
651880	656520	the boy or girl next door nature, these things were becoming normalised.
656520	661320	Creators needed to evolve, Marina on the other hand, who created a weird dynamic, despite
661320	666380	her tutorial videos being the most successful, she mostly focused on herself as a person,
666380	668120	almost overwhelmingly actually.
668120	672220	This tells me that I don't really think Marina was looking for relevance at this stage
672220	676620	in her career, but that was a lot of the YouTube mentality back then, many people just saw
676620	681100	the platform as an outlet for themselves, that was perfectly natural.
681100	685260	A lot of people might be mistaken to think that all of Marina's videos blew up because
685260	690520	of what happened in 2016, however it's clear that some of Marina's videos just had a habit
690520	694940	of deciding they were going to do the numbers, and this is essentially what created an audience
694940	695940	for her.
695940	700940	It was much more the challenges and the topics, and her personality, although fairly innocent,
700940	705420	didn't really keep a huge subscriber base coming back, not that she appeared to care
705420	709740	all that much, she was happy doing something that she was doing, with at least a somewhat
709740	710740	committed fanbase.
710740	715620	As said, the landscape of YouTube and content creation was changing very rapidly, we were
715620	719780	slowly raising the bar of the acceptable standard for many production values.
719780	723300	One thing that I found very interesting is that although Marina seemed to improve her
723300	727680	style in some ways, she carried through a lot of the quirky energy that she had always
727680	729420	portrayed to her audience.
729420	733920	I watched the Draw My Life video, and it was very endearing in documenting the struggles
733920	738820	that she faced, however I noticed that it used the exact same music as the music in
738820	743500	the fateful video that caused this phenomenon, despite having over 3 years between them.
743500	747260	Hi, my name's Marina, and I'm 16.
747260	752460	I was a little girl with long blonde hair and blue eyes, and I was always extremely
752460	753460	short.
753460	754460	My hair reached my bum.
754460	755460	That was fun.
755460	760260	Hey guys, so today I'm advertising Style U, and I'm advertising their clothes, so this
760260	763900	is me just advertising their clothes, and yeah, I love you guys so much.
763900	768020	It seems that Marina wasn't really changing that much as a creator, and normally this
768020	772600	wouldn't be a problem, but equally it meant that as a character, she began to stand out
772600	778400	even more and more in a changing landscape that had its presentation a lot more organised,
778400	779400	and to the point.
779400	784120	The sort of overly energetic, chaotic people were being replaced by people who were charismatic
784120	787180	in their own rights, but certainly not to that level.
787180	791520	Her character was always somewhat unique, her character always had its quirks, and with
791520	794020	this it made it even more distinct.
794020	798040	Not in a bad way or anything, but you'll see exactly why this matters with what we're
798040	799260	discussing next.
806620	811140	Now I personally think that Drew may well be possibly being very honest in his video,
811140	815180	and we might discuss his position a bit more towards the end, however I do not want to
815180	819940	premise his video as truth, as it's an extremely sensitive topic, and Marina has her own side
819940	825340	that she has presented indirectly in rebuttal, which we will also discuss later as well.
825340	829500	We don't need it to evaluate a lot of the culture surrounding the whole incident, people
829500	833780	didn't know then and yet we still witnessed a huge frenzy in theories and thoughts, whatever
833780	836140	happened happened, we can look at that.
836140	840020	In the previous part we discussed a lot of various theories and concepts that on their
840020	844580	own aren't particularly important, but as a combination created a situation like no
844580	849420	other, and the job of this is to visit it and apply everything we know thus far, and
849420	852740	put the pieces of the puzzle together before analysing it further.
852740	857420	Marina Joyce is a spiritual person, Marina Joyce is a person who is quite out there,
857420	860940	you can tell this from her videos, you can tell this from her tweets, I think that's
860940	862100	really important to note.
862100	866500	I had a dream that God said he liked my skirt so I wore it today.
866500	870420	These things don't just help build a persona, but they can really create a snowball effect
870420	872860	when a particular situation goes down.
872860	878100	One of the very identifiable elements of the Marina situation was that as a person, despite
878100	883300	aging significantly since her first video, her mental outlook was still one of purity,
883300	887340	one of innocence, and it takes a lot of energy to keep up that persona.
887340	891340	For many people, her mood is not a default, I know it's certainly not for me because
891340	895700	I'm a miserable bastard, but it's not hard to be that, not from my perspective at
895700	896700	least.
896700	900500	So when I look at someone like Marina, I think to myself, how much effort goes into being
900500	901500	that happy?
901500	905460	Well obviously, maybe it's not effort for her, maybe she just thinks like that, but
905460	909100	because it's so out of the ordinary, from my perspective, it becomes identifiable when
909100	914420	that mood has shifted, because it takes a positive effort to create that, and that's
914420	916140	what happened with Marina Joyce.
916140	921780	She carved out a distinctive character that perceptibly took effort, that when she started
921780	927140	behaving in a way that was not typically associated with her image, it became very clear.
927140	931420	Now the video that vaulted her into stardom was Date Outfit Ideas, however going back
931420	949320	you can see that it was evident throughout the videos before.
949320	952560	Many people pointed out that it seems she just had these moments where it looks like
952560	957220	she had some sort of Vietnam flashback, the very jolting transition from her modelling
957220	960280	to the point where she'd have a horrified look on her face.
960280	964640	And if you know her older videos, and her original videos, you can tell that her behaviour
964640	968240	throughout the whole situation isn't a momentary thing.
968240	972820	Those particular instances may accentuate that, but equally by watching her videos prior
972820	977800	to all this transpiring, you can tell that all these videos are off in their delivery.
977800	982000	She always had a bit of a muted approach to delivering sentences and so on, but the way
982000	987280	she talks is extremely stilted and disconnected in these particular videos, and it's extremely
987280	988280	noticeable.
988280	992480	Plenty of people have had spells like that in their content that have been overlooked,
992480	996300	even people who have been happy themselves, we all have rough times.
996300	1000800	Why would this cause so much chaos, when really it's just a person acting out of the ordinary?
1000800	1005860	Well it starts with a fanbase, Marina Joyce by 2016 had a channel that wasn't really
1005860	1011560	growing, was moving at a fairly stately pace, but she still had a continuous dedicated audience
1011560	1016200	who knew her personality well, that's important, as mentioned while standing out amongst the
1016200	1020880	culture she was also familiar with her own viewers, and this creates a juxtaposition
1020880	1023640	that will pinpoint any shifts in her behaviour.
1023640	1027360	Marina's persona is consistently happy, and her fans know that.
1027360	1030800	Of course she'll deal with more serious topics, but I watched a lot of old Marina
1030800	1035040	Joyce videos and every single one of them felt like they had a tone, with very little
1035040	1038640	fluctuation in mood, and ones that did felt natural.
1038640	1042960	I would liken the instant of Marina Joyce to the idea of climate and weather, whereas
1042960	1047380	weather might simply describe the sort of state of an environment at a specific time
1047380	1053000	or place, climate represents a greater trend, a long term outlook, which is why we care
1053000	1055780	about climate change rather than weather change.
1055780	1059980	As mentioned earlier, the video that caused all the distress was not one, was not the
1059980	1064660	first one where she was acting strangely, in fact she was clearly acting strangely in
1064660	1066520	multiple videos prior.
1066520	1070520	Difference is that this video was probably the one that dictated the trend, the one that
1070520	1075280	told us that this is going in a direction, and one that we probably don't want it to
1075280	1076280	go in.
1076280	1080720	I don't know exactly how it started, I don't know exactly when it began, but it was almost
1080720	1085240	certainly amplified by fans who knew that something wasn't quite right, it was not
1085240	1087160	the Marina Joyce that they knew.
1087160	1091480	Equally what was mildly concerning was the actual conflict of the messages that Marina
1091480	1095560	sent off, I've recorded videos when I've been happy, I've recorded videos when I've
1095560	1100600	been in very dark places, the one thing that I will never try to do is miss sell my mood.
1100600	1104740	Marina seemed like she was trying to recapture that positive vibe that all her viewers were
1104740	1107400	familiar with, but it just wasn't clicking.
1107400	1111000	Also keep note of the fact that she would regularly use the same music from a few years
1111000	1115400	back and would hold on to these traditions in her production, and with this, it felt
1115400	1120440	unnerving in the context with her out of place behaviour, it's like she didn't even know
1120440	1124480	she was behaving strangely, it became very weird.
1124480	1128480	Even the date outfit video when she decided to do that twirl, it's almost as if when she
1128480	1131880	turned away from the camera, she switched off, and then when she'd finished turning,
1131880	1133440	she'd got to switch back on.
1133440	1137680	Any fan of Marina's would know that the whole video, even when she was smiling, felt
1137680	1141600	uncomfortable and forced, yet it was these moments that helped add another layer that
1141600	1146200	concerned the casual viewer as well, whereas fans would notice the long term changes, casuals
1146200	1150520	would notice the volatile short term ticks, from the first days of her channel, this tone
1150520	1154900	had created a character, and suddenly it was being torn down, and you had a backlog
1154900	1156760	of content to compare it to.
1156760	1160640	With that backlog came a person who made us feel involved, a person whose life we saw
1160640	1165620	in close quarters, as mentioned earlier, unlike TV drama, people felt like they were part
1165620	1170180	of this person's life much more, that intimate relationship finally mobilised a group of
1170180	1173880	people who felt like they had influence, and they did.
1173880	1179060	This was a swell of attention that felt galvanised, but that's still not the whole story, because
1179060	1183460	as intriguing a character study as this is, it needed one more component to create the
1183460	1188940	full on hysteria that we witnessed over those few days, and the final spicy saucy ingredient
1188940	1193200	were the conspiracy theories, and not just any old conspiracy theories, because as plausible
1193200	1198620	as the ideas such as drugs, attention, or even a mental disorder were, plausibility
1198620	1203020	doesn't mean fun, and as mentioned before, people love chaos and mystery, and this was
1203020	1205320	epitomised by the kidnapping theory.
1205320	1209640	The kidnapping theory really did deserve some credit for keeping this in the public
1209640	1210640	mind.
1210640	1214280	Marina Joyce is an established creator, she's behaving extremely strangely, and she appears
1214280	1218920	to lapse into moments of terror and anguish, and some of these YouTubers come round asking
1218920	1222960	if she's been kidnapped with very interesting evidence.
1222960	1229720	In a recent Q&A video she made, someone asks her a question which prompts her to jump multiple
1229720	1230720	times.
1230720	1249560	And as she does this, a sound of what sounds like a chain is heard.
1249560	1252140	Those are some pretty light chains, mate.
1252140	1256760	Though some of the video was a bit more plausible, that bit is very questionable.
1256760	1261040	It's a strange theory, the thought that a kidnapper would allow their freshly abducted
1261040	1266920	victims to broadcast on YouTube is absolutely absurd, but at the same time, people love
1266920	1271600	the fun that the mystery can provoke, and with the hashtag SaveMarinaJoyce movement,
1271600	1273040	this all went viral.
1273040	1277660	Really it was the dark edge this situation had above all, the bruises, the fear.
1277660	1280760	It was scary, but it was stimulating for people.
1280760	1284960	Suddenly you have this unique amalgamation of so many different factors, with so much
1284960	1289960	history creating this movement that fired everyone up, thinking about how Marina Joyce
1289960	1292680	needs to be saved, the danger that she was in.
1292680	1294800	Who will rescue Marina Joyce?
1294800	1298440	Well who did?
1298440	1306800	You see, earlier on I said that Marina Joyce had a tendency to avoid capitalising on her
1306800	1312360	successful content, and although this is more notoriety than success, the views were still
1312360	1313360	excellent.
1313360	1318120	However, she once again evaded any comment on what was going on specifically.
1318120	1322000	Now Marina has admitted herself that regardless of the truth, she was not in a good place
1322000	1326200	in that moment, however at the time she was rather dismissive of the claims being put
1326200	1329040	forward towards her by many content creators.
1329040	1333280	Therefore regardless of what it is, that's why I don't think she did this for attention,
1333280	1338120	she clearly doesn't view YouTube on such a basis, she never intended to be that infamous,
1338120	1340880	and when it happened she almost let it die herself.
1340920	1345000	Of course she went on some interviews which provided her with extra publicity, but even
1345000	1349160	then they were mostly done with the purpose of playing down a lot of the theories put
1349160	1350160	forward against her.
1370880	1377600	I'm not taking drugs, I would never do that, and mainly because of my viewers, and I really
1377600	1381760	care about my viewers, so that's the reason why I wouldn't take drugs.
1381760	1386080	And like, that I go to drug free events, like I go to raves, but like the raves that I'm
1386080	1390880	going through are the drug free raves, they're not tolerated, like the places that I go to
1390880	1394280	aren't places where you can do those sort of things.
1394280	1399560	So I think people get confused by what I'm doing in my life, where by not knowing me
1399560	1405960	as well as they should, but yeah, I don't take drugs because I think that it's really
1405960	1413080	unhealthy for you, and I understand like, just like, I know what happens to those kind
1413080	1417800	of people, and it's just very dangerous for you, it can give you mental health issues
1417800	1422920	and stuff like that, it's not good for you, so I just don't recommend it to anybody, and
1422920	1426200	I just wouldn't do that myself.
1426200	1428720	Have you ever done anything like that?
1428720	1433280	Not the most persuasive explanation, but still, it seems that she wasn't interested
1433280	1438120	in milking this instant for what it was, she was a committed YouTuber, as a creator, with
1438120	1442680	a small but resolute core fanbase, she wanted to stick to what she knew, if she'd gone
1442680	1447040	down the route of talking about the real reason why she was doing all the things she was doing,
1447040	1451280	she may have caught the attention of the recent million or so new fans, but she may have done
1451280	1456080	that at the sacrifice of her committed fans, who would then be faced with a different perception
1456080	1461760	of a person who they had formerly had such a clear image of, this consistent character,
1461760	1466020	that even after the interviews, even after the admission that she wasn't exactly doing
1466020	1471040	so well, that was still maintained, or attempted to be maintained through the persona, and
1471040	1474720	so it's clear that although at the time she wasn't being completely honest, and
1474720	1479660	people may have been frustrated at the fact that she wasn't giving clear explanations,
1479660	1484160	maybe it was for the best, considering the context of it all, a small proportion of the
1484160	1487800	people who subscribed to her during the peak of the drama, did actually stick around and
1487800	1492420	provide her with additional traffic, but typically that considered over questioning her attitude,
1492420	1497320	which in my opinion, came through as her trying to rekindle that old spirit that she had before
1497320	1501800	the incident, and honestly, I think people were looking too much at that with a critical
1501800	1506260	eye, she was always a bit saccharine, she was always a bit over the top, she's just
1506260	1511140	trying to get that again, the whole incident said a lot about how mystery drives the culture
1511140	1515540	of concern, once people kinda felt like there was nothing left to see, they just kinda moved
1515540	1520360	on, I doubt many of the people who partook in the Saving Marina Joyce hashtag even gave
1520360	1524140	her channel a second look, which is probably why she's lumbering around now with a load
1524140	1529040	of dead subscribers, however, although the nihilist approach is easy and obvious in this
1529040	1533940	circumstance, and there is a cynical narrative that can be created, I think that the Saving
1533940	1538540	Marina Joyce hashtag was actually a positive movement for once, and I think that came down
1538540	1544040	to the presentation, typically movement sensationalising someone's suffering often amplifies the struggle
1544040	1548540	that they may be encountering, exposing them to a media onslaught when really what they
1548540	1553640	need is some therapy, it's not particularly helpful, and so on the surface I'd be poised
1553640	1557700	to criticise this movement as another media treatment of someone that's clearly beyond
1557700	1562100	our understanding, however, the framing of Saving Marina Joyce actually put a pretty
1562100	1567620	positive spin on it, on one hand it did amplify what she was encountering to the outside world,
1567700	1572280	but whereas sometimes a creator faces the brunt of all this, the tone of concern was
1572280	1577860	one that almost pushed a sentiment of worry onto Marina, that made her feel responsible
1577860	1582540	for all these people caring, and actually gave her the motivation to change, because
1582540	1585620	people wanted to see her well, and not like this.
1585620	1589800	When we experience hard times, I think that one of the driving elements that may cause
1589800	1594520	us to do things that are irresponsible is the idea that no one cares about the consequences
1594520	1598940	of what we do to ourselves, I've done stupid things for that reason, the thought that no
1598940	1602360	one cares about you, I mean, the thought that no one cares about you, I mean why should
1602360	1607120	you look after yourself? The power of the Saving Marina Joyce movement was that it wasn't
1607120	1613040	driven by vitriol, nor by anger, but actual care, the idea that there were people who
1613040	1618600	cared about Marina Joyce and her wellbeing, and suddenly she felt the necessity to actually
1618600	1623220	improve, and I feel that's sometimes what lacks in a lot of internet movements, actual
1623220	1626980	care for what is right, and remembering that at the other side, there are human beings
1626980	1632380	as well, Saving Marina Joyce actually encompassed some of the best of internet movements, and
1632380	1636340	the thought that you can actually pull someone back from the edge, is kinda heartwarming,
1636340	1638660	and Marina even acknowledges that herself.
1638660	1643540	Marina Joyce- But honestly, even though people seemed to make it out like they cared, I never
1643540	1647980	really got the full support that I deserved from those people, I didn't get proper help
1647980	1652900	from anyone, Saving Marina Joyce made me realise that I needed to change some things in my
1652900	1658060	life to make my life a lot happier, safer, and healthier, because I was in danger in
1658060	1662740	a lot of different ways, and that was the truth, so it's kinda not a joke when you say
1662740	1667520	help me, because I was actually in danger, and I actually went through a lot of physical
1667520	1669580	pain as well, as well as emotional pain.
1669580	1673420	Jack- Who knows what might have happened if people didn't intervene, and so when this
1673420	1678140	latest drama went down, it kinda put a sour taste in my mouth, why couldn't we have a
1678140	1682380	nice peaceful resolution, with the idea that there is some kind of positive closure, why
1682380	1686800	was it necessary to have this twitter flame war, and then the video where Marina attacks
1686800	1691980	Keemstar for 12 minutes with her boyfriend, which you know, people can say what they want,
1691980	1695560	but it was a bit of an aimless rant, if you wanna expose someone, you need to have a bit
1695560	1701100	more structure, it felt antithetical to everything that Marina had been promoting in her previous
1701100	1705460	content, and ironically it felt like for the first time she was willingly breaking out
1705460	1707100	of her normal positive persona.
1707100	1712300	Keem- What is up Drama Alert nation, I'm your host, Killer Keemstar.
1712300	1713300	Marina- SHUT UP!
1713300	1718320	Jack- The thing about Keem's comments is that he was theorising, that's what Keem does,
1718320	1723220	you can only really lie when you know the truth, even if he was right, even if he was
1723220	1728660	wrong, he wasn't wilfully lying, he's provided what he thinks happened, now you can say that's
1728660	1732960	distasteful given the context of the situation, and I might even be inclined to agree with
1732960	1737480	you, but when you leave the explanation very open ended, that's what's going to happen,
1737480	1741560	people are going to make up theories and ideas of what's occurred to try and rationalise
1741560	1745760	the situation, and that's what motivated this situation in the first place, for better
1745760	1750440	and for worse, no one is entitled to an explanation, but if you don't give them one, they're gonna
1750440	1751600	take guesses.
1751600	1755080	It's fair to say that Marina did remove this video subsequently, saying that she would
1755080	1759600	not stoop down to Keem's level, whatever the reason, it was probably for the best.
1759640	1763920	When Drew's video came out, I was also left feeling rather conflicted, on one hand, it
1763920	1767680	did somewhat bring closure to a lot of the questions surrounding her life and provided
1767680	1772600	an explanation, however given the fact that the premise that Marina was calling Keemstar
1772600	1777160	a liar on was inherently faulty, it meant that that premise really needed correction
1777160	1781980	rather than the actual situation, and it's not like she hadn't dismissed the claims made
1781980	1786920	in other videos in the past, not specifically like with Keemstar, but still none the less.
1786920	1799040	Marina has been evasive on it from the start, and to be honest I don't entirely blame her,
1799040	1803120	and so in this instance I still feel that maybe it was Marina's story to tell, though
1803120	1805840	obviously it's relieving that there's a bit of clarity.
1805840	1809360	Now of course she has released videos talking about her truth, the newest one that I'm going
1809360	1813920	to have to include in post-editing as she decided to respond to allegations again, emphasising
1813920	1824600	her use of medication, but she was equally aversive in the video, and given the amount
1824600	1828800	of contradicting accounts it's hard to believe that a high dose of medication is the complete
1828800	1833000	explanation, especially given some of the more audacious incidents, however that's
1833000	1835200	her explanation, take it or leave it.
1835200	1839560	However I would encourage Marina to leave it behind, let it go, don't let it be everything
1839560	1843700	that defines you, making numerous videos on how you don't want to talk about it seems
1843700	1845440	rather contradictory.
1845440	1849280	And to be honest, we probably won't ever hear Marina's full story, because the only
1849280	1853400	person who knows the full truth is Marina herself, and if you don't want to talk about
1853400	1857600	your experiences, then you don't have to, but what we do know is that Marina's story
1857600	1862500	is embedded in a culture, one that was born out of the bedroom era and yet evolved into
1862500	1867020	something so much weirder, where many people moved forward in their style catering to their
1867020	1871500	ever changing audiences, Marina provided a capsule of the content that she originated
1871500	1875540	from, maintaining the upbeat music and the saccharine tone, to the point where, when
1875540	1880580	that evaporated, it was such a ground shaking departure that it began a movement that no
1880580	1883260	one could have ever anticipated the size of.
1883260	1887220	Equally, there are many positives to take away from it, and although the recent conflict
1887220	1891980	has maybe put an atmosphere of cynicism over the situation, one in which parties involved
1891980	1896220	should know better, I hope that maybe we can look on the bright side of it and say, I guess
1896220	1898260	everyone was alright in the end.
1898260	1902140	Because isn't that what matters?
1902140	1903780	No.
1903780	1906660	What matters is where the hell that Peruvian temple is.
1906660	1908260	I donated good money for that you piece of-
1908260	1909720	So there is the video my friends.
1909720	1912500	I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments below.
1912500	1915340	What do you think of the Marina Joy situation, if you remember it?
1915340	1917660	Well hopefully I've jogged your memory at least.
1917660	1921960	I'd also like to give a big shout out to the editors, they do a fantastic job.
1921960	1925620	These videos would not be here without them, and the progress that they have helped me
1925620	1927620	make is incredible.
1927620	1930820	So please, I'm gonna leave their links in the description below, if you have the time
1930820	1935060	go and check them out, send them some love, they really do deserve it.
1935060	1939980	Also I want to give a big thanks to my Patreons, the generosity is really appreciated, I've
1939980	1944420	got a few of them on screen right now, they have done a fantastic service, much appreciated,
1944420	1946880	I love you guys, you really do mean a lot.
1946880	1952220	And the one individual Patreon I have to give credit to is Ryan, who is still donating $100
1952220	1957380	a month, and I do not know why anyone would do that, but thank you man, it really does
1957380	1958380	mean a lot.
1958380	1959380	I love you.
1959380	1964260	No homo, unless you want it to be homo, but then, you know, it's up to you, whatever.
1964260	1967780	Anyhow, I don't really think there's too much else to say, thanks again for the support,
1967780	1972580	it means a lot, I love you guys, and hopefully by the time this gets out, we'll be having
1972580	1973940	a good time on the channel.
1973940	1977300	Until then however, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
1987380	1988380	I'll see you guys in the next one.
1988380	1988880	Bye!
