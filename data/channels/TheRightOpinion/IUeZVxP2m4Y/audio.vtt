Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:09.560 --> 00:14.040
too much free time, and today's topic is something that kinda jumped out on me. In

00:14.040 --> 00:19.800
what way exactly? Well, it was a fine Saturday morning, I was relaxing, putting my feet up,

00:19.800 --> 00:24.280
regretting my existence, like every other Saturday morning goes. And then, in a moment

00:24.280 --> 00:29.800
of spontaneity, I decided to check my Twitter feed. Spontaneity was rewarded because I saw

00:29.800 --> 00:35.500
no one else but the man himself, Keemstar, sourcing it up with a cheeky little feud with

00:35.500 --> 00:46.020
Marina Joyce of all human beings. Suddenly I had to check my calendar, and make sure

00:46.020 --> 00:51.380
that we weren't back in 2016, because for any of you who have been blessed with not

00:51.380 --> 00:56.040
knowing who Marina Joyce is, she is a beauty slash lifestyle vlogger who became monstrously

00:56.040 --> 01:01.280
famous for a very brief moment a couple years back. If you blinked, you might have missed

01:01.280 --> 01:04.160
it, but if you had your eyes open, you might have been blinded.

01:04.160 --> 01:08.060
At the time of the drama, Marina had been doing YouTube for a few years, her channel

01:08.060 --> 01:12.720
was performing okay, but it was nothing particularly special. She had been doing pretty much the

01:12.720 --> 01:17.820
same content since the inception of her channel, mainly her unfiltered personality, trying

01:17.820 --> 01:22.000
to connect with her audiences, some games, some tutorials, and the sort of content that

01:22.000 --> 01:27.080
would attract fans of a quite innocent demographic. She was very happy, a quirky character who

01:27.080 --> 01:31.680
was definitely not afraid of delivering wholesome messages through the platform, which you know,

01:31.680 --> 01:33.360
sometimes we definitely need more of.

01:33.360 --> 01:38.400
However, all that was to change at the end of July 2016, a few days after she posted

01:38.400 --> 01:45.040
a video known as Date Outfit Ideas, a video that has now accumulated over 43 million views.

01:45.040 --> 01:48.980
Yes, that's more than any episode from the Shane Dawson documentary series, though of

01:48.980 --> 01:52.620
course the video has been out longer, so there's plenty of time for good old Shane

01:52.620 --> 01:58.080
here to overtake her. But still, let me indicate how much of a movement this was in the moment.

01:58.080 --> 02:02.940
In one day, she received 35 million views on her channel, that's what we're talking

02:02.940 --> 02:06.040
about here, that can never be ignored.

02:06.040 --> 02:10.900
What was the source of this movement? Well, one we've encountered in the past, one a

02:10.900 --> 02:15.500
mystery. The question of the moment being, what is going on with Marina Joyce? Because

02:15.500 --> 02:45.060
in this particular video, Date Outfit Ideas, Marina is seen as being a tad zoned out.

02:45.060 --> 02:50.060
And this is for a brief moment, what threw the internet into a frenzy? A delirium, my

02:50.060 --> 02:55.380
friends. And the commentators dashed for their microphones as the journalists reached for

02:55.380 --> 03:01.620
their keyboards to document the newest, weirdest internet sensation. People were asking questions,

03:01.620 --> 03:05.940
conspiracy theories were created, was she kidnapped? Was she mentally ill? Was it all

03:05.940 --> 03:10.340
for attention? Even the police were sent to her house to ascertain her wellbeing, although

03:10.340 --> 03:14.780
people were still somewhat suspicious. After all, a lot of her audience knew what she was

03:14.780 --> 03:19.900
normally like, knew her old videos, and her energetic personality, a personality that

03:19.900 --> 03:23.060
had been swapped out for a rather unnerving individual.

03:23.060 --> 03:27.900
However, as mentioned, this was a brief trend, and with Marina withholding the explanation

03:27.900 --> 03:31.980
providing there was of course one, meant that many people quickly lost interest, which is

03:31.980 --> 03:36.740
what leads us to November 2018, when Marina decides to release a video where she talks

03:36.740 --> 03:41.220
to haters, in a rather formless video which jumps from one point about the other, and

03:41.220 --> 03:45.580
talks about philosophies that are rather confusing, um, she doesn't like horror movies,

03:45.580 --> 03:50.020
being one of them, which, you know, fair enough. She goes out of the way to express how it's

03:50.020 --> 03:56.980
necessary not to reveal the nature of her condition. A debatable, but respectable stance.

03:56.980 --> 04:00.580
Another theme that prevailed throughout the video was how she planned to stay out of drama.

04:00.580 --> 04:04.660
Marina- Drama is not my cup of tea. Drinking tea.

04:04.660 --> 04:09.580
So Marina, being the very anti-drama person, decided that she would maintain this philosophy

04:09.580 --> 04:13.740
by immediately having drama with the most dramatic person in the history of the dramatic

04:13.740 --> 04:18.340
world, good old daddy Keem here. You see, after this situation was brought back into

04:18.340 --> 04:22.460
light, Keemstar boldly claimed that the reason all this occurred in the first place was because

04:22.460 --> 04:27.160
of drugs, not any specific drugs, and honestly, if this claim was true, it might have been

04:27.160 --> 04:30.980
multiple drugs, for all we know. Now when the initial situation arose, she was very

04:30.980 --> 04:35.940
quiet on the topic, she dismissed the theories, didn't really comment on it, and maybe that

04:35.940 --> 04:40.120
was for the best, maybe it wasn't, we'll debate that in a bit, but this time round

04:40.120 --> 04:44.140
it was different. When Keemstar made these claims, this time round, Marina responded

04:44.140 --> 04:49.340
differently, this time outwardly denying that they even had a shred of truth, which ironically

04:49.340 --> 04:55.260
caused the truth to be allegedly revealed. Enter stage left, Drew as sharing, a youtuber

04:55.260 --> 04:59.940
weed enthusiastic who smokes weed, yeah he smokes weed, and probably some other drugs

04:59.940 --> 05:04.380
too. Anyhow, he made a video on the topic in response to this little exchange, where

05:04.380 --> 05:10.140
he, as a self acclaimed friend of Marina Joyce, supposedly confirms Keemstar's claims that

05:10.140 --> 05:14.340
it was indeed drugs that were the cause of the extremely surreal moments witnessed in

05:14.340 --> 05:19.660
Joyce's videos. Marina then responded again in another video, prolonging this conflict,

05:19.660 --> 05:24.940
telling us the real truth, truth after truth after truth, and also promoting Buddhism,

05:24.940 --> 05:29.820
which is good, I think, and yet there was a sentiment of apathy. Sure, there were some

05:29.820 --> 05:34.060
people who were vaguely interested, but barely a fraction of the millions of people who clicked

05:34.060 --> 05:38.400
on Marina Joyce's channel on that fateful July day trying to work out what was going

05:38.400 --> 05:43.100
on in her mind. So, I guess I want this video to be an in-depth retrospective of how the

05:43.100 --> 05:47.380
situation was set up, how it went down, and how much can be said about the culture, because

05:47.380 --> 05:51.500
I do believe there is a level of exceptionalism with regards to what happened, and I think

05:51.500 --> 05:56.300
that it's time we investigated the extremely messy situation that is Marina Joyce, and

05:56.300 --> 06:00.740
see if we can find any affirmative answers to the numerous questions that will inevitably

06:00.740 --> 06:05.200
yield. Are you ready? Well, you don't have a say in this either way, it's my channel

06:05.200 --> 06:09.740
you bellends, let's dive into Marina Joyce.

06:09.740 --> 06:14.260
I think it's important to discuss the culture that Marina Joyce rose from, because generally

06:14.260 --> 06:18.500
there's this impression that Marina Joyce was just this nobody before the whole controversy,

06:18.500 --> 06:22.660
and although she was by no means anyone particularly famous, she had a decent subscriber base,

06:22.660 --> 06:26.980
and at the time, although her channel wasn't experiencing its most fruitful period, she

06:26.980 --> 06:31.740
was on the grind, and as creators, we all have good and bad months, so she wasn't wholly

06:31.740 --> 06:34.740
irrelevant, but she was experiencing a bit of a dry spell.

06:34.740 --> 06:38.780
However, I think we have to go back in time, to completely understand the context behind

06:38.780 --> 06:43.080
this. YouTube has come a long way in the space of a decade or so, we have moved from this

06:43.080 --> 06:47.540
small platform where people upload their little camcorder projects where they would go around

06:47.540 --> 06:52.640
and do what humans enjoy doing, to this world where the content created has impressive production

06:52.640 --> 06:56.600
value and many viewers couldn't imagine themselves watching anything less.

06:56.600 --> 07:01.200
It's weird to think that there was a time when many of us settled for that, and that

07:01.200 --> 07:03.480
was the era that Marina Joyce arose from.

07:03.480 --> 07:07.800
Now back in the day, a load of people sitting in their rooms rambling about 10 things that

07:07.800 --> 07:12.580
guys say in romantic relationships intertwined with some odd skit was appealing to a lot

07:12.580 --> 07:13.580
of people.

07:13.580 --> 07:18.240
Admittedly, I honestly can't ever see myself revisiting such content, and I can't really

07:18.240 --> 07:20.780
recall ever watching it in the first place.

07:20.780 --> 07:24.980
And honestly, I don't think many modern audiences can now either, but people still

07:24.980 --> 07:28.180
did, and I think that was mainly due to the realism of it all.

07:28.180 --> 07:32.400
I don't think that back then children were more easily satisfied necessarily, I just

07:32.400 --> 07:36.500
think that everything is relative, and we were enamoured by the new developments on

07:36.500 --> 07:40.260
the internet, it all felt like a step forward for us plebeians.

07:40.260 --> 07:44.160
At that point you might ask, well why didn't people just switch on the TV to see something

07:44.160 --> 07:48.820
that was better made, after all, YouTube feels like it went down that route of recent for

07:48.820 --> 07:50.360
that exact reason.

07:50.440 --> 07:54.240
You know, increasing those production values to compete with the TV, but returning to my

07:54.240 --> 07:58.560
previous point, I think that YouTube would always have something that TV will never have,

07:58.560 --> 08:02.200
unless they set up a cable channel for the commentary community of course, and in my

08:02.200 --> 08:05.740
opinion that's just the earnest involvement of audiences.

08:05.740 --> 08:09.840
You always feel like you're part of something a bit more significant than just observing

08:09.840 --> 08:11.240
the old television.

08:11.240 --> 08:15.400
The reason that I think these bedroom style vlogs were appreciated above anything else

08:15.400 --> 08:21.120
is because the style was undeniably unique, and people valued that over any nice, sharp

08:21.120 --> 08:22.120
production.

08:22.120 --> 08:26.480
This is the sort of environment that Marina thrived in, she came across as a very stereotypical

08:26.480 --> 08:30.800
teenage girl, the sort of person who was on one hand very lively and happy towards her

08:30.800 --> 08:35.000
audience, bursting into moments of spontaneity that would reflect a quirky personality.

08:35.000 --> 08:43.400
So, you know, just making this quick vlog, that, whatever, um, yeah, going to Marble Arch, woo, meetups, woo!

08:43.400 --> 08:48.240
Content that, although not laugh out loud funny, would endear a particular demographic,

08:48.240 --> 08:52.460
she'd talk about anything she cared about, and on top of that, there were videos that

08:52.460 --> 08:55.940
gave her a bit more depth than the average bedroom blogger.

08:55.940 --> 09:01.020
She was prepared to battle narratives, I mean, Nice Guys Don't Finish Last is the original

09:01.020 --> 09:03.640
incel rebuttal as far as I'm concerned.

09:03.640 --> 09:10.700
Nice Guys Do Not Finish Last, to be honest, including myself, I'm pretty sure a girl will

09:10.700 --> 09:17.160
prefer to have a guy that treats her right, and if they don't, then you are looking at the wrong girl.

09:17.160 --> 09:21.200
Marina Joyce destroys Nice Guy narrative with facts and logic.

09:21.200 --> 09:26.000
Anyhow, I think it was this nature to tackle some of the more sensitive topics, I mean,

09:26.000 --> 09:29.500
topics that were considered sensitive then at least, which definitely helped her maintain

09:29.500 --> 09:32.800
the fanbase, but they weren't the main reason she blew up.

09:32.800 --> 09:36.780
No, ever since YouTube's deactivation of the statistics tab, one of the worst things

09:36.780 --> 09:40.580
those bastards did, we've been using the way Bat Machine on The Right Opinion to find

09:40.580 --> 09:45.040
out exactly what was popping at the time, and actually it was her beauty videos that

09:45.040 --> 09:50.060
appeared to gain the most traction, initially it was her eyelash tutorial video, after all,

09:50.060 --> 09:53.480
one thing identifiable with her old videos were her eyelashes.

09:53.480 --> 09:57.720
However whereas some channels may capitalise on this, she appeared to choose to consolidate

09:57.720 --> 10:03.540
her position with videos that were more focused around herself, which has advantages and disadvantages.

10:03.540 --> 10:07.520
On one hand you're missing out on an opportunity to make more videos like those and gain a

10:07.520 --> 10:11.300
load of subscribers, but on the other hand you're organically creating a connection

10:11.300 --> 10:16.260
with the audience, an audience who are more likely to stick around with you in the hard times.

10:16.260 --> 10:21.260
This is important to remember for later, Marina definitely had a core dedicated fanbase, even

10:21.260 --> 10:25.160
though she wasn't incredibly different from a lot of her competitors at the time, she

10:26.160 --> 10:30.120
But the times they were a changing, you see bringing back the earlier point, although

10:30.120 --> 10:34.640
there was definitely an appeal within her personality, production values all around

10:34.640 --> 10:39.520
the platform were improving, however in the past, whereas having a nice attractive style

10:39.520 --> 10:43.760
was seen as a sacrifice of the genuine down to earth character, people were expanding

10:43.760 --> 10:46.460
in ways that they could essentially settle on both.

10:46.460 --> 10:51.880
As technology became more mainstream, no longer did having a good impressive camera compromise

10:51.880 --> 10:56.520
the boy or girl next door nature, these things were becoming normalised.

10:56.520 --> 11:01.320
Creators needed to evolve, Marina on the other hand, who created a weird dynamic, despite

11:01.320 --> 11:06.380
her tutorial videos being the most successful, she mostly focused on herself as a person,

11:06.380 --> 11:08.120
almost overwhelmingly actually.

11:08.120 --> 11:12.220
This tells me that I don't really think Marina was looking for relevance at this stage

11:12.220 --> 11:16.620
in her career, but that was a lot of the YouTube mentality back then, many people just saw

11:16.620 --> 11:21.100
the platform as an outlet for themselves, that was perfectly natural.

11:21.100 --> 11:25.260
A lot of people might be mistaken to think that all of Marina's videos blew up because

11:25.260 --> 11:30.520
of what happened in 2016, however it's clear that some of Marina's videos just had a habit

11:30.520 --> 11:34.940
of deciding they were going to do the numbers, and this is essentially what created an audience

11:34.940 --> 11:35.940
for her.

11:35.940 --> 11:40.940
It was much more the challenges and the topics, and her personality, although fairly innocent,

11:40.940 --> 11:45.420
didn't really keep a huge subscriber base coming back, not that she appeared to care

11:45.420 --> 11:49.740
all that much, she was happy doing something that she was doing, with at least a somewhat

11:49.740 --> 11:50.740
committed fanbase.

11:50.740 --> 11:55.620
As said, the landscape of YouTube and content creation was changing very rapidly, we were

11:55.620 --> 11:59.780
slowly raising the bar of the acceptable standard for many production values.

11:59.780 --> 12:03.300
One thing that I found very interesting is that although Marina seemed to improve her

12:03.300 --> 12:07.680
style in some ways, she carried through a lot of the quirky energy that she had always

12:07.680 --> 12:09.420
portrayed to her audience.

12:09.420 --> 12:13.920
I watched the Draw My Life video, and it was very endearing in documenting the struggles

12:13.920 --> 12:18.820
that she faced, however I noticed that it used the exact same music as the music in

12:18.820 --> 12:23.500
the fateful video that caused this phenomenon, despite having over 3 years between them.

12:23.500 --> 12:27.260
Hi, my name's Marina, and I'm 16.

12:27.260 --> 12:32.460
I was a little girl with long blonde hair and blue eyes, and I was always extremely

12:32.460 --> 12:33.460
short.

12:33.460 --> 12:34.460
My hair reached my bum.

12:34.460 --> 12:35.460
That was fun.

12:35.460 --> 12:40.260
Hey guys, so today I'm advertising Style U, and I'm advertising their clothes, so this

12:40.260 --> 12:43.900
is me just advertising their clothes, and yeah, I love you guys so much.

12:43.900 --> 12:48.020
It seems that Marina wasn't really changing that much as a creator, and normally this

12:48.020 --> 12:52.600
wouldn't be a problem, but equally it meant that as a character, she began to stand out

12:52.600 --> 12:58.400
even more and more in a changing landscape that had its presentation a lot more organised,

12:58.400 --> 12:59.400
and to the point.

12:59.400 --> 13:04.120
The sort of overly energetic, chaotic people were being replaced by people who were charismatic

13:04.120 --> 13:07.180
in their own rights, but certainly not to that level.

13:07.180 --> 13:11.520
Her character was always somewhat unique, her character always had its quirks, and with

13:11.520 --> 13:14.020
this it made it even more distinct.

13:14.020 --> 13:18.040
Not in a bad way or anything, but you'll see exactly why this matters with what we're

13:18.040 --> 13:19.260
discussing next.

13:26.620 --> 13:31.140
Now I personally think that Drew may well be possibly being very honest in his video,

13:31.140 --> 13:35.180
and we might discuss his position a bit more towards the end, however I do not want to

13:35.180 --> 13:39.940
premise his video as truth, as it's an extremely sensitive topic, and Marina has her own side

13:39.940 --> 13:45.340
that she has presented indirectly in rebuttal, which we will also discuss later as well.

13:45.340 --> 13:49.500
We don't need it to evaluate a lot of the culture surrounding the whole incident, people

13:49.500 --> 13:53.780
didn't know then and yet we still witnessed a huge frenzy in theories and thoughts, whatever

13:53.780 --> 13:56.140
happened happened, we can look at that.

13:56.140 --> 14:00.020
In the previous part we discussed a lot of various theories and concepts that on their

14:00.020 --> 14:04.580
own aren't particularly important, but as a combination created a situation like no

14:04.580 --> 14:09.420
other, and the job of this is to visit it and apply everything we know thus far, and

14:09.420 --> 14:12.740
put the pieces of the puzzle together before analysing it further.

14:12.740 --> 14:17.420
Marina Joyce is a spiritual person, Marina Joyce is a person who is quite out there,

14:17.420 --> 14:20.940
you can tell this from her videos, you can tell this from her tweets, I think that's

14:20.940 --> 14:22.100
really important to note.

14:22.100 --> 14:26.500
I had a dream that God said he liked my skirt so I wore it today.

14:26.500 --> 14:30.420
These things don't just help build a persona, but they can really create a snowball effect

14:30.420 --> 14:32.860
when a particular situation goes down.

14:32.860 --> 14:38.100
One of the very identifiable elements of the Marina situation was that as a person, despite

14:38.100 --> 14:43.300
aging significantly since her first video, her mental outlook was still one of purity,

14:43.300 --> 14:47.340
one of innocence, and it takes a lot of energy to keep up that persona.

14:47.340 --> 14:51.340
For many people, her mood is not a default, I know it's certainly not for me because

14:51.340 --> 14:55.700
I'm a miserable bastard, but it's not hard to be that, not from my perspective at

14:55.700 --> 14:56.700
least.

14:56.700 --> 15:00.500
So when I look at someone like Marina, I think to myself, how much effort goes into being

15:00.500 --> 15:01.500
that happy?

15:01.500 --> 15:05.460
Well obviously, maybe it's not effort for her, maybe she just thinks like that, but

15:05.460 --> 15:09.100
because it's so out of the ordinary, from my perspective, it becomes identifiable when

15:09.100 --> 15:14.420
that mood has shifted, because it takes a positive effort to create that, and that's

15:14.420 --> 15:16.140
what happened with Marina Joyce.

15:16.140 --> 15:21.780
She carved out a distinctive character that perceptibly took effort, that when she started

15:21.780 --> 15:27.140
behaving in a way that was not typically associated with her image, it became very clear.

15:27.140 --> 15:31.420
Now the video that vaulted her into stardom was Date Outfit Ideas, however going back

15:31.420 --> 15:49.320
you can see that it was evident throughout the videos before.

15:49.320 --> 15:52.560
Many people pointed out that it seems she just had these moments where it looks like

15:52.560 --> 15:57.220
she had some sort of Vietnam flashback, the very jolting transition from her modelling

15:57.220 --> 16:00.280
to the point where she'd have a horrified look on her face.

16:00.280 --> 16:04.640
And if you know her older videos, and her original videos, you can tell that her behaviour

16:04.640 --> 16:08.240
throughout the whole situation isn't a momentary thing.

16:08.240 --> 16:12.820
Those particular instances may accentuate that, but equally by watching her videos prior

16:12.820 --> 16:17.800
to all this transpiring, you can tell that all these videos are off in their delivery.

16:17.800 --> 16:22.000
She always had a bit of a muted approach to delivering sentences and so on, but the way

16:22.000 --> 16:27.280
she talks is extremely stilted and disconnected in these particular videos, and it's extremely

16:27.280 --> 16:28.280
noticeable.

16:28.280 --> 16:32.480
Plenty of people have had spells like that in their content that have been overlooked,

16:32.480 --> 16:36.300
even people who have been happy themselves, we all have rough times.

16:36.300 --> 16:40.800
Why would this cause so much chaos, when really it's just a person acting out of the ordinary?

16:40.800 --> 16:45.860
Well it starts with a fanbase, Marina Joyce by 2016 had a channel that wasn't really

16:45.860 --> 16:51.560
growing, was moving at a fairly stately pace, but she still had a continuous dedicated audience

16:51.560 --> 16:56.200
who knew her personality well, that's important, as mentioned while standing out amongst the

16:56.200 --> 17:00.880
culture she was also familiar with her own viewers, and this creates a juxtaposition

17:00.880 --> 17:03.640
that will pinpoint any shifts in her behaviour.

17:03.640 --> 17:07.360
Marina's persona is consistently happy, and her fans know that.

17:07.360 --> 17:10.800
Of course she'll deal with more serious topics, but I watched a lot of old Marina

17:10.800 --> 17:15.040
Joyce videos and every single one of them felt like they had a tone, with very little

17:15.040 --> 17:18.640
fluctuation in mood, and ones that did felt natural.

17:18.640 --> 17:22.960
I would liken the instant of Marina Joyce to the idea of climate and weather, whereas

17:22.960 --> 17:27.380
weather might simply describe the sort of state of an environment at a specific time

17:27.380 --> 17:33.000
or place, climate represents a greater trend, a long term outlook, which is why we care

17:33.000 --> 17:35.780
about climate change rather than weather change.

17:35.780 --> 17:39.980
As mentioned earlier, the video that caused all the distress was not one, was not the

17:39.980 --> 17:44.660
first one where she was acting strangely, in fact she was clearly acting strangely in

17:44.660 --> 17:46.520
multiple videos prior.

17:46.520 --> 17:50.520
Difference is that this video was probably the one that dictated the trend, the one that

17:50.520 --> 17:55.280
told us that this is going in a direction, and one that we probably don't want it to

17:55.280 --> 17:56.280
go in.

17:56.280 --> 18:00.720
I don't know exactly how it started, I don't know exactly when it began, but it was almost

18:00.720 --> 18:05.240
certainly amplified by fans who knew that something wasn't quite right, it was not

18:05.240 --> 18:07.160
the Marina Joyce that they knew.

18:07.160 --> 18:11.480
Equally what was mildly concerning was the actual conflict of the messages that Marina

18:11.480 --> 18:15.560
sent off, I've recorded videos when I've been happy, I've recorded videos when I've

18:15.560 --> 18:20.600
been in very dark places, the one thing that I will never try to do is miss sell my mood.

18:20.600 --> 18:24.740
Marina seemed like she was trying to recapture that positive vibe that all her viewers were

18:24.740 --> 18:27.400
familiar with, but it just wasn't clicking.

18:27.400 --> 18:31.000
Also keep note of the fact that she would regularly use the same music from a few years

18:31.000 --> 18:35.400
back and would hold on to these traditions in her production, and with this, it felt

18:35.400 --> 18:40.440
unnerving in the context with her out of place behaviour, it's like she didn't even know

18:40.440 --> 18:44.480
she was behaving strangely, it became very weird.

18:44.480 --> 18:48.480
Even the date outfit video when she decided to do that twirl, it's almost as if when she

18:48.480 --> 18:51.880
turned away from the camera, she switched off, and then when she'd finished turning,

18:51.880 --> 18:53.440
she'd got to switch back on.

18:53.440 --> 18:57.680
Any fan of Marina's would know that the whole video, even when she was smiling, felt

18:57.680 --> 19:01.600
uncomfortable and forced, yet it was these moments that helped add another layer that

19:01.600 --> 19:06.200
concerned the casual viewer as well, whereas fans would notice the long term changes, casuals

19:06.200 --> 19:10.520
would notice the volatile short term ticks, from the first days of her channel, this tone

19:10.520 --> 19:14.900
had created a character, and suddenly it was being torn down, and you had a backlog

19:14.900 --> 19:16.760
of content to compare it to.

19:16.760 --> 19:20.640
With that backlog came a person who made us feel involved, a person whose life we saw

19:20.640 --> 19:25.620
in close quarters, as mentioned earlier, unlike TV drama, people felt like they were part

19:25.620 --> 19:30.180
of this person's life much more, that intimate relationship finally mobilised a group of

19:30.180 --> 19:33.880
people who felt like they had influence, and they did.

19:33.880 --> 19:39.060
This was a swell of attention that felt galvanised, but that's still not the whole story, because

19:39.060 --> 19:43.460
as intriguing a character study as this is, it needed one more component to create the

19:43.460 --> 19:48.940
full on hysteria that we witnessed over those few days, and the final spicy saucy ingredient

19:48.940 --> 19:53.200
were the conspiracy theories, and not just any old conspiracy theories, because as plausible

19:53.200 --> 19:58.620
as the ideas such as drugs, attention, or even a mental disorder were, plausibility

19:58.620 --> 20:03.020
doesn't mean fun, and as mentioned before, people love chaos and mystery, and this was

20:03.020 --> 20:05.320
epitomised by the kidnapping theory.

20:05.320 --> 20:09.640
The kidnapping theory really did deserve some credit for keeping this in the public

20:09.640 --> 20:10.640
mind.

20:10.640 --> 20:14.280
Marina Joyce is an established creator, she's behaving extremely strangely, and she appears

20:14.280 --> 20:18.920
to lapse into moments of terror and anguish, and some of these YouTubers come round asking

20:18.920 --> 20:22.960
if she's been kidnapped with very interesting evidence.

20:22.960 --> 20:29.720
In a recent Q&A video she made, someone asks her a question which prompts her to jump multiple

20:29.720 --> 20:30.720
times.

20:30.720 --> 20:49.560
And as she does this, a sound of what sounds like a chain is heard.

20:49.560 --> 20:52.140
Those are some pretty light chains, mate.

20:52.140 --> 20:56.760
Though some of the video was a bit more plausible, that bit is very questionable.

20:56.760 --> 21:01.040
It's a strange theory, the thought that a kidnapper would allow their freshly abducted

21:01.040 --> 21:06.920
victims to broadcast on YouTube is absolutely absurd, but at the same time, people love

21:06.920 --> 21:11.600
the fun that the mystery can provoke, and with the hashtag SaveMarinaJoyce movement,

21:11.600 --> 21:13.040
this all went viral.

21:13.040 --> 21:17.660
Really it was the dark edge this situation had above all, the bruises, the fear.

21:17.660 --> 21:20.760
It was scary, but it was stimulating for people.

21:20.760 --> 21:24.960
Suddenly you have this unique amalgamation of so many different factors, with so much

21:24.960 --> 21:29.960
history creating this movement that fired everyone up, thinking about how Marina Joyce

21:29.960 --> 21:32.680
needs to be saved, the danger that she was in.

21:32.680 --> 21:34.800
Who will rescue Marina Joyce?

21:34.800 --> 21:38.440
Well who did?

21:38.440 --> 21:46.800
You see, earlier on I said that Marina Joyce had a tendency to avoid capitalising on her

21:46.800 --> 21:52.360
successful content, and although this is more notoriety than success, the views were still

21:52.360 --> 21:53.360
excellent.

21:53.360 --> 21:58.120
However, she once again evaded any comment on what was going on specifically.

21:58.120 --> 22:02.000
Now Marina has admitted herself that regardless of the truth, she was not in a good place

22:02.000 --> 22:06.200
in that moment, however at the time she was rather dismissive of the claims being put

22:06.200 --> 22:09.040
forward towards her by many content creators.

22:09.040 --> 22:13.280
Therefore regardless of what it is, that's why I don't think she did this for attention,

22:13.280 --> 22:18.120
she clearly doesn't view YouTube on such a basis, she never intended to be that infamous,

22:18.120 --> 22:20.880
and when it happened she almost let it die herself.

22:20.920 --> 22:25.000
Of course she went on some interviews which provided her with extra publicity, but even

22:25.000 --> 22:29.160
then they were mostly done with the purpose of playing down a lot of the theories put

22:29.160 --> 22:30.160
forward against her.

22:50.880 --> 22:57.600
I'm not taking drugs, I would never do that, and mainly because of my viewers, and I really

22:57.600 --> 23:01.760
care about my viewers, so that's the reason why I wouldn't take drugs.

23:01.760 --> 23:06.080
And like, that I go to drug free events, like I go to raves, but like the raves that I'm

23:06.080 --> 23:10.880
going through are the drug free raves, they're not tolerated, like the places that I go to

23:10.880 --> 23:14.280
aren't places where you can do those sort of things.

23:14.280 --> 23:19.560
So I think people get confused by what I'm doing in my life, where by not knowing me

23:19.560 --> 23:25.960
as well as they should, but yeah, I don't take drugs because I think that it's really

23:25.960 --> 23:33.080
unhealthy for you, and I understand like, just like, I know what happens to those kind

23:33.080 --> 23:37.800
of people, and it's just very dangerous for you, it can give you mental health issues

23:37.800 --> 23:42.920
and stuff like that, it's not good for you, so I just don't recommend it to anybody, and

23:42.920 --> 23:46.200
I just wouldn't do that myself.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.720
Have you ever done anything like that?

23:48.720 --> 23:53.280
Not the most persuasive explanation, but still, it seems that she wasn't interested

23:53.280 --> 23:58.120
in milking this instant for what it was, she was a committed YouTuber, as a creator, with

23:58.120 --> 24:02.680
a small but resolute core fanbase, she wanted to stick to what she knew, if she'd gone

24:02.680 --> 24:07.040
down the route of talking about the real reason why she was doing all the things she was doing,

24:07.040 --> 24:11.280
she may have caught the attention of the recent million or so new fans, but she may have done

24:11.280 --> 24:16.080
that at the sacrifice of her committed fans, who would then be faced with a different perception

24:16.080 --> 24:21.760
of a person who they had formerly had such a clear image of, this consistent character,

24:21.760 --> 24:26.020
that even after the interviews, even after the admission that she wasn't exactly doing

24:26.020 --> 24:31.040
so well, that was still maintained, or attempted to be maintained through the persona, and

24:31.040 --> 24:34.720
so it's clear that although at the time she wasn't being completely honest, and

24:34.720 --> 24:39.660
people may have been frustrated at the fact that she wasn't giving clear explanations,

24:39.660 --> 24:44.160
maybe it was for the best, considering the context of it all, a small proportion of the

24:44.160 --> 24:47.800
people who subscribed to her during the peak of the drama, did actually stick around and

24:47.800 --> 24:52.420
provide her with additional traffic, but typically that considered over questioning her attitude,

24:52.420 --> 24:57.320
which in my opinion, came through as her trying to rekindle that old spirit that she had before

24:57.320 --> 25:01.800
the incident, and honestly, I think people were looking too much at that with a critical

25:01.800 --> 25:06.260
eye, she was always a bit saccharine, she was always a bit over the top, she's just

25:06.260 --> 25:11.140
trying to get that again, the whole incident said a lot about how mystery drives the culture

25:11.140 --> 25:15.540
of concern, once people kinda felt like there was nothing left to see, they just kinda moved

25:15.540 --> 25:20.360
on, I doubt many of the people who partook in the Saving Marina Joyce hashtag even gave

25:20.360 --> 25:24.140
her channel a second look, which is probably why she's lumbering around now with a load

25:24.140 --> 25:29.040
of dead subscribers, however, although the nihilist approach is easy and obvious in this

25:29.040 --> 25:33.940
circumstance, and there is a cynical narrative that can be created, I think that the Saving

25:33.940 --> 25:38.540
Marina Joyce hashtag was actually a positive movement for once, and I think that came down

25:38.540 --> 25:44.040
to the presentation, typically movement sensationalising someone's suffering often amplifies the struggle

25:44.040 --> 25:48.540
that they may be encountering, exposing them to a media onslaught when really what they

25:48.540 --> 25:53.640
need is some therapy, it's not particularly helpful, and so on the surface I'd be poised

25:53.640 --> 25:57.700
to criticise this movement as another media treatment of someone that's clearly beyond

25:57.700 --> 26:02.100
our understanding, however, the framing of Saving Marina Joyce actually put a pretty

26:02.100 --> 26:07.620
positive spin on it, on one hand it did amplify what she was encountering to the outside world,

26:07.700 --> 26:12.280
but whereas sometimes a creator faces the brunt of all this, the tone of concern was

26:12.280 --> 26:17.860
one that almost pushed a sentiment of worry onto Marina, that made her feel responsible

26:17.860 --> 26:22.540
for all these people caring, and actually gave her the motivation to change, because

26:22.540 --> 26:25.620
people wanted to see her well, and not like this.

26:25.620 --> 26:29.800
When we experience hard times, I think that one of the driving elements that may cause

26:29.800 --> 26:34.520
us to do things that are irresponsible is the idea that no one cares about the consequences

26:34.520 --> 26:38.940
of what we do to ourselves, I've done stupid things for that reason, the thought that no

26:38.940 --> 26:42.360
one cares about you, I mean, the thought that no one cares about you, I mean why should

26:42.360 --> 26:47.120
you look after yourself? The power of the Saving Marina Joyce movement was that it wasn't

26:47.120 --> 26:53.040
driven by vitriol, nor by anger, but actual care, the idea that there were people who

26:53.040 --> 26:58.600
cared about Marina Joyce and her wellbeing, and suddenly she felt the necessity to actually

26:58.600 --> 27:03.220
improve, and I feel that's sometimes what lacks in a lot of internet movements, actual

27:03.220 --> 27:06.980
care for what is right, and remembering that at the other side, there are human beings

27:06.980 --> 27:12.380
as well, Saving Marina Joyce actually encompassed some of the best of internet movements, and

27:12.380 --> 27:16.340
the thought that you can actually pull someone back from the edge, is kinda heartwarming,

27:16.340 --> 27:18.660
and Marina even acknowledges that herself.

27:18.660 --> 27:23.540
Marina Joyce- But honestly, even though people seemed to make it out like they cared, I never

27:23.540 --> 27:27.980
really got the full support that I deserved from those people, I didn't get proper help

27:27.980 --> 27:32.900
from anyone, Saving Marina Joyce made me realise that I needed to change some things in my

27:32.900 --> 27:38.060
life to make my life a lot happier, safer, and healthier, because I was in danger in

27:38.060 --> 27:42.740
a lot of different ways, and that was the truth, so it's kinda not a joke when you say

27:42.740 --> 27:47.520
help me, because I was actually in danger, and I actually went through a lot of physical

27:47.520 --> 27:49.580
pain as well, as well as emotional pain.

27:49.580 --> 27:53.420
Jack- Who knows what might have happened if people didn't intervene, and so when this

27:53.420 --> 27:58.140
latest drama went down, it kinda put a sour taste in my mouth, why couldn't we have a

27:58.140 --> 28:02.380
nice peaceful resolution, with the idea that there is some kind of positive closure, why

28:02.380 --> 28:06.800
was it necessary to have this twitter flame war, and then the video where Marina attacks

28:06.800 --> 28:11.980
Keemstar for 12 minutes with her boyfriend, which you know, people can say what they want,

28:11.980 --> 28:15.560
but it was a bit of an aimless rant, if you wanna expose someone, you need to have a bit

28:15.560 --> 28:21.100
more structure, it felt antithetical to everything that Marina had been promoting in her previous

28:21.100 --> 28:25.460
content, and ironically it felt like for the first time she was willingly breaking out

28:25.460 --> 28:27.100
of her normal positive persona.

28:27.100 --> 28:32.300
Keem- What is up Drama Alert nation, I'm your host, Killer Keemstar.

28:32.300 --> 28:33.300
Marina- SHUT UP!

28:33.300 --> 28:38.320
Jack- The thing about Keem's comments is that he was theorising, that's what Keem does,

28:38.320 --> 28:43.220
you can only really lie when you know the truth, even if he was right, even if he was

28:43.220 --> 28:48.660
wrong, he wasn't wilfully lying, he's provided what he thinks happened, now you can say that's

28:48.660 --> 28:52.960
distasteful given the context of the situation, and I might even be inclined to agree with

28:52.960 --> 28:57.480
you, but when you leave the explanation very open ended, that's what's going to happen,

28:57.480 --> 29:01.560
people are going to make up theories and ideas of what's occurred to try and rationalise

29:01.560 --> 29:05.760
the situation, and that's what motivated this situation in the first place, for better

29:05.760 --> 29:10.440
and for worse, no one is entitled to an explanation, but if you don't give them one, they're gonna

29:10.440 --> 29:11.600
take guesses.

29:11.600 --> 29:15.080
It's fair to say that Marina did remove this video subsequently, saying that she would

29:15.080 --> 29:19.600
not stoop down to Keem's level, whatever the reason, it was probably for the best.

29:19.640 --> 29:23.920
When Drew's video came out, I was also left feeling rather conflicted, on one hand, it

29:23.920 --> 29:27.680
did somewhat bring closure to a lot of the questions surrounding her life and provided

29:27.680 --> 29:32.600
an explanation, however given the fact that the premise that Marina was calling Keemstar

29:32.600 --> 29:37.160
a liar on was inherently faulty, it meant that that premise really needed correction

29:37.160 --> 29:41.980
rather than the actual situation, and it's not like she hadn't dismissed the claims made

29:41.980 --> 29:46.920
in other videos in the past, not specifically like with Keemstar, but still none the less.

29:46.920 --> 29:59.040
Marina has been evasive on it from the start, and to be honest I don't entirely blame her,

29:59.040 --> 30:03.120
and so in this instance I still feel that maybe it was Marina's story to tell, though

30:03.120 --> 30:05.840
obviously it's relieving that there's a bit of clarity.

30:05.840 --> 30:09.360
Now of course she has released videos talking about her truth, the newest one that I'm going

30:09.360 --> 30:13.920
to have to include in post-editing as she decided to respond to allegations again, emphasising

30:13.920 --> 30:24.600
her use of medication, but she was equally aversive in the video, and given the amount

30:24.600 --> 30:28.800
of contradicting accounts it's hard to believe that a high dose of medication is the complete

30:28.800 --> 30:33.000
explanation, especially given some of the more audacious incidents, however that's

30:33.000 --> 30:35.200
her explanation, take it or leave it.

30:35.200 --> 30:39.560
However I would encourage Marina to leave it behind, let it go, don't let it be everything

30:39.560 --> 30:43.700
that defines you, making numerous videos on how you don't want to talk about it seems

30:43.700 --> 30:45.440
rather contradictory.

30:45.440 --> 30:49.280
And to be honest, we probably won't ever hear Marina's full story, because the only

30:49.280 --> 30:53.400
person who knows the full truth is Marina herself, and if you don't want to talk about

30:53.400 --> 30:57.600
your experiences, then you don't have to, but what we do know is that Marina's story

30:57.600 --> 31:02.500
is embedded in a culture, one that was born out of the bedroom era and yet evolved into

31:02.500 --> 31:07.020
something so much weirder, where many people moved forward in their style catering to their

31:07.020 --> 31:11.500
ever changing audiences, Marina provided a capsule of the content that she originated

31:11.500 --> 31:15.540
from, maintaining the upbeat music and the saccharine tone, to the point where, when

31:15.540 --> 31:20.580
that evaporated, it was such a ground shaking departure that it began a movement that no

31:20.580 --> 31:23.260
one could have ever anticipated the size of.

31:23.260 --> 31:27.220
Equally, there are many positives to take away from it, and although the recent conflict

31:27.220 --> 31:31.980
has maybe put an atmosphere of cynicism over the situation, one in which parties involved

31:31.980 --> 31:36.220
should know better, I hope that maybe we can look on the bright side of it and say, I guess

31:36.220 --> 31:38.260
everyone was alright in the end.

31:38.260 --> 31:42.140
Because isn't that what matters?

31:42.140 --> 31:43.780
No.

31:43.780 --> 31:46.660
What matters is where the hell that Peruvian temple is.

31:46.660 --> 31:48.260
I donated good money for that you piece of-

31:48.260 --> 31:49.720
So there is the video my friends.

31:49.720 --> 31:52.500
I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments below.

31:52.500 --> 31:55.340
What do you think of the Marina Joy situation, if you remember it?

31:55.340 --> 31:57.660
Well hopefully I've jogged your memory at least.

31:57.660 --> 32:01.960
I'd also like to give a big shout out to the editors, they do a fantastic job.

32:01.960 --> 32:05.620
These videos would not be here without them, and the progress that they have helped me

32:05.620 --> 32:07.620
make is incredible.

32:07.620 --> 32:10.820
So please, I'm gonna leave their links in the description below, if you have the time

32:10.820 --> 32:15.060
go and check them out, send them some love, they really do deserve it.

32:15.060 --> 32:19.980
Also I want to give a big thanks to my Patreons, the generosity is really appreciated, I've

32:19.980 --> 32:24.420
got a few of them on screen right now, they have done a fantastic service, much appreciated,

32:24.420 --> 32:26.880
I love you guys, you really do mean a lot.

32:26.880 --> 32:32.220
And the one individual Patreon I have to give credit to is Ryan, who is still donating $100

32:32.220 --> 32:37.380
a month, and I do not know why anyone would do that, but thank you man, it really does

32:37.380 --> 32:38.380
mean a lot.

32:38.380 --> 32:39.380
I love you.

32:39.380 --> 32:44.260
No homo, unless you want it to be homo, but then, you know, it's up to you, whatever.

32:44.260 --> 32:47.780
Anyhow, I don't really think there's too much else to say, thanks again for the support,

32:47.780 --> 32:52.580
it means a lot, I love you guys, and hopefully by the time this gets out, we'll be having

32:52.580 --> 32:53.940
a good time on the channel.

32:53.940 --> 32:57.300
Until then however, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

33:07.380 --> 33:08.380
I'll see you guys in the next one.

33:08.380 --> 33:08.880
Bye!
