00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:16.000 --> 00:20.360
too much free time, and honestly, weight is not something I've touched on that often,

00:20.360 --> 00:23.840
despite it being a pretty common topic in discussion all over the internet, because

00:23.840 --> 00:27.540
in case it hasn't been apparent, the whole concern surrounding obesity has been one of

00:27.540 --> 00:32.300
the problems arising over the last few decades. With a shift in culture made by many people,

00:32.300 --> 00:36.380
it appears that access to consumption and sedentary lifestyle has created what many

00:36.380 --> 00:41.620
view as an epidemic, particularly in countries like the US where obesity has ballooned. There

00:41.620 --> 00:45.900
are many reasons for why this is considered to have happened, and there are many hypotheses,

00:45.900 --> 00:51.700
but at the end of the day, what we can confirm is that obesity exists, and with the existence

00:51.700 --> 00:57.380
of fat people comes the existence of fat YouTubers. Obese, overweight YouTubers are nothing

00:57.380 --> 01:01.040
particularly new. You're dealing with a platform that is based online, many people

01:01.040 --> 01:04.940
on the platform aren't the most active, and some people might even find appeal within

01:04.940 --> 01:14.580
their great weight. However, from this transpired a new genre, this mainly revolved around weight

01:14.580 --> 01:18.780
loss. The reasons should be fairly obvious, we as viewers typically look for some element

01:18.780 --> 01:22.260
of ourselves in the creator, whether that's something we currently have, or whether that's

01:22.260 --> 01:26.500
something we aspire to be. Now, when you have a weight loss YouTuber, this is someone that

01:26.500 --> 01:31.140
we should follow their journey with, we find inspiration in their progress, maybe you're

01:31.140 --> 01:35.120
an overweight person yourself, but at the same time you're an introvert or an agoraphobe,

01:35.120 --> 01:38.680
and you don't want to show your body at a Weight Watchers meeting. Maybe those people

01:38.680 --> 01:43.180
online can give some advice on how to lose weight from the realms off the screen. Although

01:43.180 --> 01:47.980
it may not be sufficient to make you lose weight on its own, they may provide that inspiration,

01:47.980 --> 01:51.820
may provide you with that extra motivation, and then you can maybe document your journey

01:51.820 --> 01:55.900
online too, and inspire other people to come along with you. The problem is that this vision

01:55.940 --> 02:00.020
doesn't always happen, and sometimes people themselves aren't strong enough to create

02:00.020 --> 02:04.100
that arc through their own volition, and thus the story changes very significantly, and

02:04.100 --> 02:08.580
because they're documenting all of it on YouTube, suddenly this augments into something much

02:08.580 --> 02:14.100
uglier and we can see a bigger, scarier picture. This is where we reach today's creator, the

02:14.100 --> 02:18.300
creator known as Amblin Reed. It was a late evening, and I had worked on a video only

02:18.300 --> 02:22.340
to make the decision that actually, although I wasn't a fan of the creator's content, there

02:22.340 --> 02:26.240
wasn't enough to follow through on it, so I decided to watch a few videos. I knew one

02:26.240 --> 02:30.340
of my fellow creators known as Danaki had released a couple of uploads on these YouTubers

02:30.340 --> 02:34.340
who were rather notorious for the handling of their weight on the platform, and so in

02:34.340 --> 02:38.380
my crisis I decided to sit down and watch them, and although he was a tad too insulting

02:38.380 --> 02:42.580
for my rather polite demeanour, he touched on some very important points that I definitely

02:42.580 --> 02:47.180
feel could be expanded on in a right opinion video. His content definitely does a great

02:47.180 --> 02:51.500
job at individually calling out the YouTubers in question, but what is there beneath the

02:51.500 --> 02:52.500
surface?

02:52.500 --> 02:56.900
Let's talk about the YouTuber of the day. This is Amblin Reed. She is a 28-year-old

02:56.900 --> 03:01.340
YouTuber from the United States of America. She recently became a target for a lot of

03:01.340 --> 03:06.500
YouTubers for a multitude of reasons. Typically, the cycle consists of her doing something,

03:06.500 --> 03:10.500
people reacting, people noting her rather counterproductive efforts to lose weight,

03:10.500 --> 03:14.500
people noting various other negative traits such as her apparent compulsion to lie and

03:14.500 --> 03:18.820
deceive her audience, and alleged manipulation of certain situations. Hell, there is a whole

03:18.820 --> 03:24.140
channel dedicated to exposing Amblin. That is some spicy commitment, considering that

03:24.140 --> 03:28.340
many of these videos receive more views than Amber's videos themselves.

03:28.340 --> 03:32.120
Amblin appears to be a dubious character for more reasons than just her weight, and although

03:32.120 --> 03:35.840
I do consider many of them valid criticisms and would definitely implore people to look

03:35.840 --> 03:39.400
into them, that will typically be a secondary narrative of this video, because although

03:39.400 --> 03:42.940
I will definitely touch on that, there's a lot of detail to these stories that I think

03:42.940 --> 03:48.040
you can only really see from the testimonies, and I don't plan on addressing all of those,

03:48.040 --> 03:51.900
although if you are interested, I'll definitely reference and link some of the more controversial

03:51.900 --> 03:55.880
incidents sooner or later on in the video, because there is a lot to cover.

03:55.880 --> 04:01.260
One term that I saw thrown around a lot was the word lolcow. This is a strange word, and

04:01.260 --> 04:05.360
one that I have only encountered rather recently, but rather often relating to this specific

04:05.360 --> 04:09.000
case. I thought it might be a derogatory term relating to her size, but in fact, it's

04:09.000 --> 04:13.120
a catch-all phrase that explains an individual whose behaviour is being mocked and yet is

04:13.120 --> 04:17.360
completely oblivious to it, and they continue to behave in this way, but I'm not sure

04:17.360 --> 04:21.800
that's completely the case. In the past few months, Amblin's channel has grown significantly,

04:21.800 --> 04:25.600
and this has essentially snowballed, which has brought her the attention of many commentators

04:25.600 --> 04:29.120
who have decided to call her out, and yet in spite of this, she has persisted, paying

04:29.120 --> 04:33.360
little attention, or just doing the classic YouTuber blocking out the haters technique.

04:33.360 --> 04:37.080
However, none of these antics are particularly new, and anyone who's been along for the

04:37.080 --> 04:41.720
ride will be aware of that. However, how long has it really been going on for?

04:41.720 --> 04:46.200
Today's video will discuss the rise of Amblin Reed, and why her appeal is rather different

04:46.200 --> 04:51.360
than many others, and explain what this means for both her, and many of her peers. From

04:51.360 --> 04:54.880
what I've seen, a lot of the videos so far is that they do a great job at presenting

04:54.880 --> 04:59.000
these various incidents that, in a way, don't seem too connected, but I'd argue there

04:59.000 --> 05:03.760
is a connection that we can put together, so join me in the right opinion as we take

05:03.760 --> 05:10.960
a dive into the very twisted reality of Amblin Reed. Let's go.

05:10.960 --> 05:16.560
Amblin Reed opened her channel on YouTube on the 17th of September 2011. However, she

05:16.560 --> 05:22.360
didn't start posting until two years later, the 17th of November 2013. This first video

05:22.360 --> 05:26.600
was an interesting one, because it showed Amblin without a cause, exactly.

05:27.240 --> 05:35.360
I think making these YouTube videos, it might make me accountable. I just think it would

05:35.360 --> 05:46.520
really help me. I watch so many people who make videos, and they're so inspirational.

05:46.520 --> 05:52.420
Maybe I could be an inspiration for somebody. I don't know. I'm not really doing this

05:52.420 --> 05:56.520
for other people, and more so doing it for myself, but if I can help somebody along the

05:56.520 --> 06:00.800
way, then that's even better.

06:00.800 --> 06:04.880
When we open our YouTube channels, it's fairly typical that we don't know how to

06:04.880 --> 06:09.200
provide an introduction, and yet in this video, in many ways, you could see how things might

06:09.200 --> 06:14.360
take shape in a positive direction. Weight loss creators, in many ways, are very polished,

06:14.360 --> 06:19.120
well-produced individuals with a clear plan, and it sells in a way. You throw in some inspirational

06:19.120 --> 06:23.480
music, a riling speech, and you might end up with a Fousey-esque sort of video, which

06:23.480 --> 06:27.640
even though isn't my cup of tea, it is a lot of people's, especially the internet

06:27.640 --> 06:28.640
casuals.

06:28.640 --> 06:39.280
To understand where I'm at, you have to understand where I started from. A couple

06:39.280 --> 06:47.040
of years ago, I was in the best shape of my life. Mentally, physically, and spiritually.

06:47.040 --> 06:51.440
Never mind, we've already got that. The thing is, that in spite of all this, I can

06:51.440 --> 06:56.560
see the appeal of the more insecure individual, putting their story up on websites for the

06:56.560 --> 07:01.120
world to see, and I think that it's important that people like that are represented. That's

07:01.120 --> 07:05.680
the most real you're gonna get. And that's the thing, what you see right here is a different

07:05.680 --> 07:10.480
person, the whole mentality, how she thinks of herself. There is no real agenda here,

07:10.480 --> 07:15.440
no real plot right now, it's just a person documenting their life. That is classic YouTube.

07:15.440 --> 07:19.360
In fact, although I wouldn't necessarily say that her videos are exactly the epitome

07:19.360 --> 07:23.840
of a vlog, she brands herself as a vlogging channel, and they're characterised by that

07:23.840 --> 07:28.560
sort of journey, but never having too much of a purpose, just having a little arc inside

07:28.560 --> 07:29.560
the video.

07:29.560 --> 07:32.880
And this is the thing, although it's very niche and not exactly something that masses

07:32.880 --> 07:37.480
of audiences are gonna see in YouTube trending because it isn't done up all nicely, I can

07:37.480 --> 07:41.760
see how this content would be important for some people, and judging by a couple of the

07:41.760 --> 07:46.120
comments, it clearly was. One of the biggest problems is that people often feel like they're

07:46.120 --> 07:49.960
alone in their experiences, and therefore it's important that people who do have the

07:49.960 --> 07:54.240
courage to speak about them maybe should, although of course it's their own discretion.

07:54.240 --> 07:58.200
And although Anne Boleyn's channel was inherently bleak in its tone, when you talk about your

07:58.200 --> 08:02.440
quote past, it comes with the implication that it's in the past, and there is this notion

08:02.440 --> 08:06.700
of being able to move forward. Now I'm going to discuss why eventually Anne Boleyn's decision

08:06.700 --> 08:11.320
of her channel direction would soon show these videos in a problematic light, but honestly,

08:11.320 --> 08:15.760
videos like An Emotional Look Into My Past back then without the turn in her content

08:15.800 --> 08:18.680
would've been powerful videos for some people at the time.

08:18.680 --> 08:26.080
So this video is going to be about my childhood and what led me up to where I am now, and

08:26.080 --> 08:27.880
I hope you stick around to watch it.

08:27.880 --> 08:31.580
While she was doing this, she'd do like this weekly weigh in where she would keep her subscribers

08:31.580 --> 08:35.540
up to date with exactly how her weight was heading. Now it seems that typically when

08:35.540 --> 08:40.720
she started a channel, it fluctuated around the 360s, pounds that is, which for any of

08:40.720 --> 08:46.880
you metric lads is around 160kg. Sometimes these weigh ins went well, other times they

08:46.880 --> 08:47.880
didn't.

08:47.880 --> 08:51.980
But the only person I can really blame it on is me. I put the food on the fork and put

08:51.980 --> 08:55.660
it in my mouth. It's that simple. It is that simple completely.

08:55.660 --> 08:59.860
And with her earlier channel days, her response seemed genuine, and it seemed genuine in a

08:59.860 --> 09:04.480
way that it didn't have to gain anything from its audience. There wasn't any overwhelming

09:04.480 --> 09:08.380
success and when she did put on weight, she held her hands up and said that she could

09:08.380 --> 09:12.400
do better. She'd talk about the time when she'd lose weight, 89 pounds to be exact,

09:12.400 --> 09:32.180
to give that hope and motivation.

09:32.180 --> 09:37.280
None of it seemed like the content that people are observing today. It seems completely different.

09:37.280 --> 09:41.540
Her diet was very back and forth, but a lot of the time, the food she did present was

09:41.540 --> 09:47.800
alright if we can date the start of the channel at around 2013. By April 2014, her weight

09:47.800 --> 10:03.800
was pretty similar.

10:03.800 --> 10:08.340
I make this observation, I say it's important, because I think it's necessary to understand

10:08.340 --> 10:13.040
the context and present to you the dilemma. It seems apparent to me that unless she is

10:13.040 --> 10:17.300
one of the most calculated creators in the history of YouTube, she didn't start the

10:17.300 --> 10:22.000
channel with the intent of amassing the weight she has now. In fact, honestly, very little

10:22.000 --> 10:26.420
change in weight is one of the very common outcomes for many people trying to lose weight.

10:26.420 --> 10:31.280
The content was not dramatic, the content was not created with the antagonistic intent

10:31.280 --> 10:35.680
that we'll witness later. That means something has happened in her life that has changed

10:35.680 --> 10:40.060
her mentality towards this career path. And listen, she's lousy at keeping to goals,

10:40.060 --> 10:43.900
and clearly incompetent at points, without a doubt, and the cycle that people talk about

10:43.900 --> 10:48.920
is still here, but she seems to believe what she says even if it's just in the moment.

10:48.920 --> 10:53.300
And that's the difference a lot of people seem to identify with her earlier content

10:53.300 --> 10:55.120
just looking at the comment sections.

10:55.120 --> 10:59.060
So thus far, I hope I've made the point with regards to this individual. If you feel like

10:59.060 --> 11:02.960
you need to go watch more of her channel and arrange those videos from oldest to newest,

11:02.960 --> 11:06.260
and hopefully you'll see the perspective that I'm presenting right now. With this

11:06.260 --> 11:10.980
in mind, I want to go forward and see if we can put a date on any change in her behaviour.

11:10.980 --> 11:14.260
So my journey continued, October 2014.

11:14.260 --> 11:24.380
And I'm down. I weighed in at 362.0. So I'm down 4.8 pounds.

11:24.380 --> 11:26.180
February 2015.

11:26.180 --> 11:31.300
February 9, 2015. My starting weight is 388.8.

11:31.300 --> 11:32.300
May 2015.

11:32.300 --> 11:40.560
I weighed in today at 405.2. It's bittersweet. I wish I was at my lowest weight still. Can't

11:40.560 --> 11:42.040
keep holding on to that.

11:42.040 --> 12:03.840
And here we have it. This is the start of Amblin's slippery slope into weight oblivion.

12:03.840 --> 12:08.640
When I look at YouTubers, I find it very interesting to see if they've just snatched, or if it

12:08.640 --> 12:13.200
was a gradual disintegration of their persona. And to question what the causation of that

12:13.200 --> 12:17.400
was, as we've seen here, it's quite apparent that at the start of these videos, there was

12:17.400 --> 12:22.840
some semblance of aim or goal, and by the end, it's fallen apart, as observed by multiple

12:22.840 --> 12:23.840
commentators.

12:23.840 --> 12:27.540
This is certainly a process that has elapsed over time. However, the time where this was

12:27.540 --> 12:33.240
initiated was 2015, and this was a bad year for Amblin in general. However, what I noticed

12:33.240 --> 12:37.800
is that although she may be still rather softly spoken, a lot of her rhetoric doesn't feel

12:37.800 --> 12:43.040
as genuine anymore. For example, she's still using the 89 pound story a lot, but it now

12:43.040 --> 12:45.800
feels like a deflection rather than self-assurance.

13:13.040 --> 13:32.560
Although it's important to keep in mind one's achievements to remind them of their

13:32.560 --> 13:37.620
capability, the repetition that Amblin creates constantly seems like a self-justification

13:37.620 --> 13:41.520
mechanism to try and hold on to something that she's clearly having trouble retaining.

13:41.520 --> 13:45.240
Do I believe the story? Well, that's something that we'll reach soon, but the problem is,

13:45.240 --> 13:49.780
believe it or not, it's not relevant, and in fact promotes an unhealthy mindset that

13:49.780 --> 13:55.200
masquerades the problem in previous accomplishments. Equally, this is where you get to see a rise

13:55.200 --> 13:58.320
in that cycle that we've observed from many other commentators.

13:58.320 --> 14:24.520
And listen, it's fairly normal for someone to try a diet, then give up because it's not

14:24.520 --> 14:28.920
working out for them. Amblin is definitely towards the extreme end of the bell curve

14:28.920 --> 14:33.600
for failed diets, but she genuinely may be that weak-willed to follow through. But at

14:33.600 --> 14:38.780
the same time, the sheer number of times this happens makes you start to doubt the legitimacy.

14:38.780 --> 14:42.260
There's a reason for that though, and it's not because she fails the diets, but it's

14:42.260 --> 14:46.920
always because she records and publicises the taking on and the subsequent failure of

14:46.920 --> 14:48.920
the diets in exactly the same way.

15:16.920 --> 15:33.560
The problem is that Amblin doesn't seem to listen

15:33.560 --> 15:38.760
to her own advice, and the shift that we're observing is one that has come from the lack

15:38.760 --> 15:42.440
of change in a way. And I've always said this, one of the greatest ways to generate

15:42.440 --> 15:48.080
views is conflict. Conflict arises constantly, and people have a natural interest. Oh my,

15:48.080 --> 15:52.360
who broke up? Who cheated on who? But with Amblin, the problem was not just the fact

15:52.360 --> 15:56.260
that these conflicts never changed, but her reaction never changed, to the point where

15:56.260 --> 16:01.180
you'd experience déjà vu. These striking similarities, for example, between her breakup

16:01.180 --> 16:03.940
videos were noticed by many audiences.

16:31.180 --> 16:40.480
And in a way, you'd expect some similarity in the reaction, after all it's the same

16:40.480 --> 16:45.600
person and the same life event. But as an audience member, if you are genuinely like

16:45.600 --> 16:49.780
what I'd hope an ideal viewer to be, a person rooting for an individual's success in their

16:49.780 --> 16:54.240
goals yet critical where necessary, this is going to be exceptionally uncomfortable for

16:54.240 --> 16:58.400
you, because as creators we are expected to evolve and move forward, make it personal.

16:58.400 --> 17:02.660
The problem was that Amblin's channel began to feel less and less about specific struggles

17:02.660 --> 17:07.660
and more like a soap opera where rhetoric and emotional response is valued over actual

17:07.660 --> 17:13.200
evolution and actual working towards goals, and personal connection with that viewer in

17:13.200 --> 17:18.720
light of that. And everyone knows the success of manufactured content, and with the repetition

17:18.720 --> 17:23.860
and similarity, people began to doubt the honesty of Amblin's content. And as I was

17:23.860 --> 17:27.800
watching, I did too. You're having this cycle of conflict that generates views, you make

17:27.800 --> 17:31.300
a video talking about how it's going to change, this in theory is meant to gain the sympathy

17:31.300 --> 17:35.760
of the viewer, it's a moment of respect, you're trying to combat the challenges of your weight,

17:35.760 --> 17:39.920
and suddenly you do a video and oh no you've relapsed, and suddenly you've put on another

17:39.920 --> 17:45.800
twenty pounds, and it happens again and again and again, it's a downward spiral. On top

17:45.800 --> 17:49.840
of this, something that many people haven't spoken about is the fact that videos about

17:49.840 --> 17:54.640
gaining weight do numbers, partly because there is this very seedy audience who find

17:54.640 --> 17:58.420
that content attractive, you'll see them occasionally in the comments, but a lot of

17:58.420 --> 18:01.880
the time I'm sure they don't want to make their presence known. The amount of weight

18:01.880 --> 18:07.200
gain content on some websites is concerning. As reasonable human beings, we all have a

18:07.200 --> 18:12.360
line we draw for what we deem as a septal justification for a situation occurring. Weight

18:12.360 --> 18:16.960
gain can happen, it's happened to me, it'll probably happen to me again, it's difficult

18:16.960 --> 18:21.480
sometimes completely monitoring your diet, if you can do that, fair play to you, but

18:21.480 --> 18:26.020
sometimes people just can't. The thing is, the ambulance shower relies on her audience

18:26.020 --> 18:30.440
having sympathy for her situation, and although we can be reasonable sometimes and listen

18:30.440 --> 18:34.440
to people talk about their struggles, when someone says oh I can't stop eating, let me

18:34.440 --> 18:39.200
just consume some ben and jerry's, oh woe is me, we become suspicious of that person's

18:39.200 --> 18:44.120
actual drive to change their lifestyle. And yes, of course it's important to document

18:44.120 --> 18:48.160
your weaknesses, but at the same time you have to know how to frame them, and the titles

18:48.160 --> 18:51.920
were becoming more clickbait and it no longer felt like a weight loss channel but more

18:51.920 --> 18:55.900
like a channel where the weight becomes part of the gimmick. And that's okay if you want

18:55.900 --> 18:59.720
to do that, but you have to understand that all these channels are a journey, and if Anne

18:59.720 --> 19:03.600
Boleyn by some miracle lost the weight that she actually claimed she would, the journey

19:03.600 --> 19:07.920
would end, and she'd lose the viewers. I mean, people are there for the weight, and

19:07.920 --> 19:12.860
if the weight is gone, so is the appeal. Weight loss channels are not known for their longevity,

19:12.860 --> 19:16.400
some large youtubers have lost weight but that's different, they established themselves

19:16.400 --> 19:20.240
before, you're gonna have a much harder time significantly establishing yourself on

19:20.240 --> 19:24.840
the idea of losing weight alone, so by not losing it but yet continuously committing

19:24.840 --> 19:29.900
to it, she maintains the limbo of viewer interest. The whole storyline represents a dangerous

19:29.900 --> 19:34.600
precedent, the content seems much more self-indulgent than reflective, and here's the thing, it's

19:34.600 --> 19:39.800
okay to show weakness, it's okay to be human in your videos, but at the same time you can't

19:39.800 --> 19:44.160
glorify those flaws like they're fucking clickbait. And although she never explicitly

19:44.160 --> 19:48.200
stated that, she had created content who was implicitly affirming a lifestyle that

19:48.200 --> 19:52.280
was counterproductive to the notion of weight loss, and you can see that in her titles,

19:52.280 --> 19:56.200
you can see that in her clickbait, you can see that in her presentation, her attitude

19:56.200 --> 20:00.320
is changing, and it was only going to get worse for her. Which is where I introduce

20:00.320 --> 20:03.280
you to the year that ruined Anne Boleyn Reid.

20:14.160 --> 20:28.400
As said, when Anne Boleyn started up her channel, she had a handful of anecdotes that she would

20:28.400 --> 20:32.280
throw around here and there, ones about her family, ones about her relationships, ones

20:32.280 --> 20:37.080
about her childhood, and how it shaped who she is today, and at the time, they seemed

20:37.080 --> 20:40.720
genuine, they didn't seem too dishonest in their presentation, she didn't appear to have

20:40.720 --> 20:45.400
too much of a motivation to lie about these circumstances. However, as time went on and

20:45.400 --> 20:50.780
people started becoming disinterested in these same stories she would continuously espouse,

20:50.780 --> 20:55.840
she decided to do two things. Firstly, she made her own stories. This was done by generating

20:55.840 --> 21:00.600
melodrama throughout her vlogs, but also she retold stories that seemed less likely and

21:00.600 --> 21:04.920
more dishonest, and just involved downright lying to justify what might be considered

21:05.920 --> 21:12.160
For example, she claims that she's bipolar, or was bipolar, or probably is bipolar. It

21:12.160 --> 21:16.760
seems like she's not quite sure. Or what about that time that she was diagnosed with binge

21:16.760 --> 21:21.240
eating disorder back in 2007?

21:21.240 --> 21:29.720
When it comes to scrambled eggs, I'm gonna be honest, they sometimes make me feel nauseous,

21:29.720 --> 21:32.640
and it's because I have an allergy to them.

21:32.640 --> 21:33.640
How do you like your eggs?

21:34.360 --> 21:40.160
This escalated to a point where she made a video addressing the multiple lies, some of

21:40.160 --> 21:43.520
which were fairly harmless, others not so much.

21:43.520 --> 21:49.080
So if you guys remember my aunt situation, this was a while ago though. This was probably,

21:49.080 --> 21:54.560
I don't know, it was months ago. Months, to be honest. When I uploaded a video about

21:54.560 --> 22:03.040
how my aunt doesn't talk to me anymore because I'm fat. I was vulnerable and I was upset

22:03.040 --> 22:10.360
and I really felt like blaming my weight on everything was just like the easiest way

22:10.360 --> 22:21.200
to go. And if she's watching this, I am so sorry and I really just, I wish I could change

22:21.200 --> 22:26.120
who I am as a person. Because I really want my aunt back.

22:26.120 --> 22:31.600
My weight, I wouldn't say I've lied to you guys per se about it, but I definitely haven't

22:31.600 --> 22:40.960
been like very into like telling you guys my weight. I'm fluctuating a lot. Okay, so

22:40.960 --> 22:49.960
something else I've lied about is the job I had in Florida. I told you guys that I was

22:49.960 --> 22:59.680
a PCA worker at assisted living facility full time and I wasn't. I was a PCA worker at assisted

22:59.680 --> 23:05.960
living facility, but I was not full time. I did not want to live off of destiny. And

23:05.960 --> 23:10.240
when I was living in Florida at the beginning, I did not make enough money on YouTube. I

23:10.240 --> 23:15.400
lied about that. I did not make enough money on YouTube to support us. Something else I've

23:15.400 --> 23:20.280
lied about is my blood pressure. On several occasions, I have said I don't have diabetes.

23:20.280 --> 23:24.920
I don't have high blood pressure. I don't have high cholesterol. I don't have this or

23:24.920 --> 23:32.320
whatever. All of that is true, besides the blood pressure. I don't have high blood pressure,

23:32.320 --> 23:34.520
but I have borderline high blood pressure.

23:34.520 --> 23:38.720
The problem was that these lines were escalating further and further, and when you're a person

23:38.720 --> 23:42.480
with only so much to you like Anne Blinn Reid, you're going to have a limited scope in your

23:42.480 --> 23:47.360
ability to captivate the audiences. So what can you do apart from exacerbate already existent

23:47.360 --> 23:51.660
drama? And this was already hurting people such as that relationship with her aunt, whether

23:51.660 --> 23:55.760
those tears were real or not, you get the feeling that either way someone's losing out

23:55.760 --> 23:59.940
on a possibly beneficial relationship if it existed. And at the end of the day, I feel

23:59.940 --> 24:04.020
that Anne Blinn is probably needing that more than anyone else in this situation. And first

24:04.020 --> 24:07.720
of all, I just want to say that's the sad thing about these lines. Anne Blinn thinks

24:07.720 --> 24:12.020
she can put on a brave face, shed a few tears and use that to gain audience sympathy. But

24:12.020 --> 24:17.420
all she's doing is undoing any flavor of genuineness her old content once had with the drama that

24:17.420 --> 24:22.300
followed the year after. You not only threw any audience bond into contention, but all

24:22.300 --> 24:26.540
those people who might have once said, wow, that's so relatable. I feel that way too.

24:26.540 --> 24:30.740
And now questioning themselves because you've turned out to be rather disreputable in your

24:30.740 --> 24:34.900
behavior. This is the thing. I wanted to show a more sympathetic side of Anne Blinn Reid

24:34.900 --> 24:39.160
so that we can now contrast that with what she has become. In her old video, she was

24:39.160 --> 24:43.240
more restrained and arguably less emotive. And that actually worked because when you're

24:43.240 --> 24:48.000
not forcing anything, it doesn't feel like you're trying to push any emotion or deceive

24:48.000 --> 24:53.120
your audience. One thing I noticed is that Anne Blinn actually became much more disingenuous

24:53.120 --> 24:57.440
because her character became much more extroverted, much more expressive, and it felt like she

24:57.440 --> 25:02.200
was constantly trying to sell her audience a message, an agenda, and these regularly

25:02.200 --> 25:03.200
conflicted.

25:03.200 --> 25:08.160
YouTube rewards gluttony, clickbait, and trainwrecks, and you can probably tell that this is what

25:08.160 --> 25:12.640
she cares about now, given the amount of ads she puts on, it's borderline parody. And

25:12.680 --> 25:18.240
I'll save that point for the end, because her lies escalated in the summer of 2016 in

25:18.240 --> 25:23.980
a very interesting move where she decided to try and extend or revive that deep relationship

25:23.980 --> 25:28.660
which she had done in the past by talking about her past. But she decided that she was

25:28.660 --> 25:32.600
going to lay claim to the story about an abusive partner.

25:32.600 --> 25:36.640
Now experiences that have happened in our lives can be very difficult to talk about,

25:36.640 --> 25:40.640
mainly because of the emotional trauma that we may have experienced due to it. However,

25:40.640 --> 25:45.320
if you speak about a person who may no longer be there, or may not be aware that you're

25:45.320 --> 25:50.060
speaking about them, or may not have the platform to defend themselves, it is also very easy

25:50.060 --> 25:54.680
for your claims to go unchallenged, and therefore much of the judgement comes down to perception.

25:54.680 --> 25:59.020
I know that I can't necessarily prove many of the things that I've spoken about that

25:59.020 --> 26:03.400
happened to me in my childhood, and therefore it comes down to personal credibility.

26:03.400 --> 26:07.400
And in some ways this seems like a smart idea on Anne Blinn's part, because someone of

26:07.400 --> 26:11.680
her calibre at this point seems immoral enough to purposely talk about these subjects without

26:11.680 --> 26:16.100
fear of repercussions, because if you deny it, you're denying her traumatic experience.

26:16.100 --> 26:21.200
How dare you? How dare you do that? You see, it seems like a safe move on her part, but

26:21.200 --> 26:22.200
it wasn't.

26:22.200 --> 26:27.120
Her favourite spot was my stomach. She would punch me really hard in my stomach. She punched

26:27.120 --> 26:33.580
me around right here a lot. She would punch me on my arms, and she would continuously

26:33.580 --> 26:37.780
do it until I agreed to make love to her, or have sex, whatever you want to consider

26:37.780 --> 26:38.780
it.

26:38.780 --> 26:43.180
No, in fact her ex-partner Casey, who was identifying as a female during the original

26:43.180 --> 26:49.260
relationship as Cassidy, released a video documenting his experiences with Amblin, refuting

26:49.260 --> 26:52.260
her claims and arguing that he was the victim of the abuse.

26:52.260 --> 26:59.780
I've gotten hit before. I went to school with bruises up and down my arms. Bruises.

26:59.780 --> 27:06.580
My friends asked me, what's wrong? What happened to you? Eventually they figured it out. So

27:06.580 --> 27:17.060
every time I would come to school upset, in tears, bruised, on my arms, hands, cuts, scars,

27:17.060 --> 27:20.600
amber again.

27:20.600 --> 27:25.900
Much of this comes down to one word against another, so in many ways Amblin had many opportunities

27:25.900 --> 27:30.240
to respond to his claims. Maybe she'd argue, maybe she'd bring some evidence forward,

27:30.240 --> 27:33.780
but no, she just removed her original video and kept quiet.

27:33.780 --> 27:38.000
However there is a re-upload which can quite clearly show how manipulative she is if our

27:38.000 --> 27:41.820
judgement of these events is correct. She hooks the audience in with that anecdote of

27:41.820 --> 27:46.540
her parents, and how intimate this was to her, and then leads into this elaborate story

27:46.540 --> 27:49.040
about her experience.

27:49.040 --> 27:52.700
The one thing that she did do was this very strange poetry reading, which I suppose was

27:52.700 --> 27:56.780
meant to be some kind of cryptic response, but that's the best she can do. She's

27:56.780 --> 28:00.140
trying to be in a position of vagueness so that the person can't respond.

28:00.140 --> 28:06.220
Rain and petals eavesdrop, I used the wrong word. Rain and petals eavesdrop, I used the

28:06.220 --> 28:11.700
wrong word. Rain and petals eavesdrop, I used the wrong word. My mental hygiene has been

28:11.700 --> 28:13.220
rotten and stirred.

28:13.220 --> 28:17.800
Not quite Tennyson, is it? And that's another thing I wanted to note. Amblin seems to use

28:17.800 --> 28:22.140
these tropes like poetry and literature that are typically seen as channeling one's feelings

28:22.140 --> 28:27.860
into a higher emotive plane to circumvent criticism and try and add depth to her character.

28:27.860 --> 28:32.300
Using art to convey false feelings is extremely manipulative because we typically look to

28:32.300 --> 28:36.940
the implicit messages of art to indirectly convey the character of a person that they

28:36.940 --> 28:42.060
may not express directly. It's like an outlet, so that we may look back and one day say,

28:42.060 --> 28:46.900
oh what a troubled mind. But Amblin takes advantage of that and she tries to convey

28:46.900 --> 28:51.620
sentiments that aren't really true, and now she's trying to portray experiences that

28:51.620 --> 28:55.020
aren't really true. Fortunately, people saw through it.

28:55.020 --> 29:00.220
And this is the thing, if this was true, this is the most vulnerable and open you can get,

29:00.220 --> 29:04.580
and let me explain why that's important. If I am late to some appointments, some people

29:04.580 --> 29:08.780
might not trust me when I commit to arriving at a certain time, but they might still trust

29:08.780 --> 29:12.580
me if I decide to talk about more personal matters because they will assume that you

29:12.580 --> 29:17.100
have a degree of respect for the sensitivity of those subjects and will not take advantage

29:17.100 --> 29:22.340
of them for personal gain. This is exactly what Amblin has done, and thus she has sacrificed

29:22.340 --> 29:26.740
all of her credibility. You cannot trust her when she tries to open up about more personal

29:26.740 --> 29:31.560
content in the future, and it brings into question everything she's ever spoken about.

29:31.560 --> 29:36.260
What if this content that once bonded people was just a fraud all along? I don't know

29:36.260 --> 29:41.020
if it was all a fraud because I don't know if she had the same goal at the start of her

29:41.020 --> 29:44.960
channel, but I'm sure that's what it's descended to now, and it's genuinely sad

29:44.960 --> 29:49.100
that the few people that she may have given hope to at one point have probably seen that

29:49.100 --> 29:54.280
desolated by a fame-driven appeal to a populace who are watching a train wreck.

29:54.280 --> 29:59.240
2016 was also the year that introduced her to Mukbang. By now she'd already started

29:59.240 --> 30:03.140
doing food reviews, which clearly wasn't a good decision, but Mukbang was really the

30:03.140 --> 30:07.180
straw that broke the camel's back, and I think that's what annoyed a lot of people.

30:07.180 --> 30:11.840
The simple fact is that no one who is actively trying to lose weight can simultaneously create

30:11.840 --> 30:15.360
a fantastic brand of eating large amounts of food in one sitting, unless it's sesame

30:15.360 --> 30:19.200
seeds. The only way you could do that is if you were exercising an equal amount of time

30:19.200 --> 30:23.460
to burn off the calories, which Amblin was clearly not doing, but it gave her some of

30:23.460 --> 30:27.960
the best views in her career, so who cared, and it made her put on weight, and then she

30:27.960 --> 30:31.240
could bring attention to her weight which also generated views, and you create this

30:31.240 --> 30:36.240
cycle that runs again, and again, and again. But this channel shouldn't be about views,

30:36.620 --> 30:39.620
it's about Amblin, and there are so many problems to observe here.

30:46.620 --> 30:50.720
I can't speak for everyone here, but I've often found my behaviour a somewhat conscious

30:50.720 --> 30:54.360
response to the environment around me. When I have found myself in situations where my

30:54.360 --> 31:00.320
reputation might be viewed badly by those in my circle, I have an option to work hard

31:00.320 --> 31:04.820
to realign that view of me, or I could fall into fulfilling what they view of me and not

31:04.820 --> 31:08.860
bother what they think. I've often worked hard to take the former option because firstly

31:08.860 --> 31:12.820
because I'm a paranoid person who does enjoy being on good terms with those around me,

31:12.820 --> 31:17.060
and secondly because I think it's a better thing to do, it's a more positive impact.

31:17.060 --> 31:21.380
Being self-conscious isn't a blessing in some ways, it causes a lot of stress in social

31:21.380 --> 31:26.660
situations, but at the same time being self-aware is important, because you not just look after

31:26.660 --> 31:31.180
yourself, but you look after the message that you might be portraying to your audience.

31:32.180 --> 31:38.340
I feel that in this situation, Amblin has eventually found herself in so much drama

31:38.340 --> 31:42.940
and found it so profitable that she has completely disregarded on her. That has made her more

31:42.940 --> 31:48.020
audacious, outgoing, and perhaps even confident, but it also makes her more fake, more toxic,

31:48.020 --> 31:52.380
and more destructive. When she half-heartedly tries to create a bond with any viewers that

31:52.380 --> 31:56.260
might actually be there for her personality, which I'm highly doubtful of, she's found

31:56.260 --> 32:00.700
it much easier to fall into the worst perception that people have of her rather than actively

32:00.740 --> 32:05.460
challenging it. As her personality has changed, so has her lifestyle, and she put on more

32:05.460 --> 32:10.020
and more weight, while supposedly lamenting it. In my opinion, although they don't receive

32:10.020 --> 32:13.820
much airtime in developing their character, she has surrounded herself with people who

32:13.820 --> 32:17.180
don't challenge that mentality and may actually affirm it.

32:31.700 --> 32:36.340
Studies show that you're much more likely to conform to those around you in person than

32:36.340 --> 32:40.740
if they're impersonal, like over the web, or over the phone. In the original video,

32:40.740 --> 32:44.220
she's clearly much more conscious about what people think, but now she's clearly

32:44.220 --> 32:48.500
comfortable in her real-life situation, and that's all she sees herself as having to

32:48.500 --> 32:52.880
answer to now. There's a load of pointing fingers about who's caused who to gain weight

32:52.880 --> 32:57.420
and so on, and I don't know who is doing what specifically, I don't know what goes

32:57.420 --> 33:02.460
on behind the scenes exactly other than it involves food. What I do know is that it's

33:02.460 --> 33:06.860
happening, and regardless of the excuses that Amblin tries to spew, she has put on a significant

33:06.860 --> 33:11.300
amount of weight, weight that when we look at her old content, she didn't put on, and

33:11.300 --> 33:15.060
she didn't put it on for a while. This was content that regardless of whether you believe

33:15.060 --> 33:19.760
it was legitimate or not, showed that Amblin doesn't have the world's slowest metabolism

33:19.760 --> 33:23.640
and can't do anything at all to prevent her weight gain. In the last couple years,

33:23.640 --> 33:27.340
the amount of hate she's been receiving has steadily increased, probably due to people

33:27.340 --> 33:32.720
calling out that cycle. And yet, I think by going through that cycle, she has just found

33:32.720 --> 33:36.660
herself falling further and further into it, and she has responded to this by doing these

33:36.660 --> 33:41.380
reading hate comments. This successfully alienates herself from the audience and the genuine

33:41.380 --> 33:46.160
criticism that she might be receiving. Whether people's tone is right or not does not discount

33:46.160 --> 33:50.480
the genuine problems here. She attributes the criticism to the fact that she is fat.

33:50.480 --> 34:06.560
And not the fact that she has continuously failed to sort herself out, despite the fact

34:06.560 --> 34:10.800
that she's acknowledged this many times before so much that people don't believe that she

34:10.800 --> 34:32.760
is taking her own criticism seriously.

34:32.760 --> 34:36.840
There are so many videos documenting these constant contradictions, that one can be found

34:36.840 --> 34:41.240
on the Binge Monsters channel, I'll leave it in the pinned comment. And I think how

34:41.240 --> 34:45.960
the thought of just firstly her lack of care in these actions, and then the thought that

34:45.960 --> 34:50.640
she recorded, edited and uploaded it, with the thought that this is a good message to

34:50.640 --> 34:55.980
be sending, it doesn't feel real. It feels like she's taking advantage, and then the

34:55.980 --> 35:00.680
next day she'll express regret, which will just seem as insincere. Her attitude just

35:00.680 --> 35:05.760
screams to me, someone who doesn't care anymore. Whatever there was in the past just isn't

35:05.760 --> 35:10.040
there, and I think that's the most dishonest factor that comes into this, is the fact that

35:10.040 --> 35:14.960
she still wants to care, and now all she does is cater to people who want to watch the disaster

35:14.960 --> 35:21.520
unfold and count up those pounds, 400 pounds, 500 pounds, approaching 600 pounds, which

35:21.520 --> 35:25.040
would be around 270 kilograms.

35:25.040 --> 35:29.600
I think Anne Boleyn came onto YouTube for the weight loss, I mean in her old video she

35:29.600 --> 35:33.880
said she wanted to do this because she wanted an audience to hold her accountable, but the

35:33.880 --> 35:37.880
problem is that when that audience decided to hold it into account, regardless of whether

35:37.880 --> 35:42.760
they may have been hostile or not, she clearly didn't handle it well, and YouTube became

35:42.760 --> 35:47.680
about a different goal, she realised that she could foster that hostility, and garner

35:47.680 --> 35:53.040
more views. She shifted the responsibility of her diet onto the audience response, and

35:53.040 --> 35:58.840
since has continued to gain weight, at a rate that has not been noted before on her channel,

35:58.840 --> 36:03.120
continuously committing to change but failing, and now whenever she has those solemn speeches

36:03.160 --> 36:07.200
where she promises to do better, it feels like a political ruse rather than actually

36:07.200 --> 36:11.940
any genuine commitment, even if in the early days her commitments were futile, it felt

36:11.940 --> 36:16.560
like she believed them at the time. Does she really believe them now? I hope she does,

36:16.560 --> 36:20.600
but if she does change, it will not be with the mindset that she currently has, which

36:20.600 --> 36:25.160
is a self-destructive one, if she really does care about getting her weight down, then she

36:25.160 --> 36:29.520
has to change, if she doesn't want to lose weight, well there's nothing I can say to

36:29.520 --> 36:33.760
her. With regards to that on principle, it's not what I'd recommend, and you're putting

36:33.760 --> 36:39.000
an awful lot of stress onto an already struggling healthcare system, but at the same time, you

36:39.000 --> 36:44.000
need to stop promoting this arc, this cycle, to possibly vulnerable people that your mentality

36:44.000 --> 36:48.580
is justifiable to someone who might want to lose weight, even though you apparently want

36:48.580 --> 36:52.540
to lose weight. To a majority of the audience, it might seem obvious that this is not the

36:52.540 --> 36:56.480
way that someone should live, but there will always be people who are questioning their

36:56.480 --> 37:00.480
own responsibility, and although it's definitely possible that some people are weaker than

37:00.480 --> 37:05.040
others, because your situation is not like any other Amberlynn, you have an audience

37:05.040 --> 37:10.360
that is now watching a person, and counting up their weight until something terrible happens,

37:10.360 --> 37:14.440
and you're placing 8 mid-roll ads, and you're probably making a decent amount of money from

37:14.440 --> 37:18.880
that, other people don't have that, so don't try and frame your mentality from a moral

37:18.880 --> 37:22.980
standpoint because most other people who might be in a similar weight position don't have

37:22.980 --> 37:27.540
all these motivations that have become so obvious in your recent content, they do not

37:27.540 --> 37:32.680
have that safety net. I mean, come on, look at those mid-rolls. And the list of stuff

37:32.680 --> 37:37.020
she does goes on and on and on, and it's not worth documenting them all right now because

37:37.020 --> 37:41.740
at the end of the day, they can be explained by the mentality we've discussed. More lying,

37:41.740 --> 37:46.320
animal maltreatment, some kind of pyramid scheme. She apparently created a fake account

37:46.320 --> 37:51.460
to defend herself from criticism in a Facebook and apparently Discord group too. It's genuinely

37:51.460 --> 37:55.260
frustrating because whether she was genuine in her first videos or not, it's clear they

37:55.260 --> 38:00.780
meant something to people, and now it's just come to here, and I wish it hadn't. Do you

38:00.780 --> 38:05.580
know how many puns I can make now? But you see, I'm a man of refrain, because I accept

38:05.580 --> 38:09.340
that life is not easy, and when we deal with serious problems in our lives, we might let

38:09.340 --> 38:13.500
go of some of the things that we are meant to take care of, but at the same time, it's

38:13.500 --> 38:18.220
important that we acknowledge the consequences our actions might have, and I think that's

38:18.220 --> 38:22.460
what bothers people. You're a public figure. There is this mentality that people are gonna

38:22.460 --> 38:26.820
hate on you just because you're fat, and sure, a few people are like that, but at the

38:26.820 --> 38:31.600
same time, being overweight does promote an insecurity in many people, and I think you

38:31.600 --> 38:36.500
understand that insecurity too. Your old videos definitely seem that way. Other YouTube related

38:36.500 --> 38:40.780
factors that you might be experiencing may override that now, but that's not the case

38:40.780 --> 38:45.180
for anyone else that you're sending these messages to. You are the exception, not the

38:45.180 --> 38:50.140
rule. In our first ever video, Anne Boleyn says she's doing this for herself.

38:50.140 --> 38:53.820
I'm not really doing this for other people, I'm more so doing it for myself.

38:53.820 --> 38:58.320
It's clear what that means to her now. This is the problem. Anne Boleyn cannot stop the

38:58.320 --> 39:03.580
cycle of failure, and food, and consumption, or else she will lose her subscribers regardless

39:03.580 --> 39:07.860
of their motivation to stay, and she'll continue to push herself further and further until

39:07.860 --> 39:11.420
something terrible happens, and she loses that audience that she gained in the first

39:11.420 --> 39:15.460
place, and all she'll be left with is a lot of weight, and the security is gone, and

39:15.460 --> 39:20.080
all that drama, all that deception that you took part in that hurt people, the clearly

39:20.080 --> 39:24.420
affected people, would be for nothing. You're on thin ice as it is. People don't stick

39:24.420 --> 39:28.260
around for the credibility because they know you have none of that. You've destroyed

39:28.260 --> 39:32.220
that for the sake of clickbait and views, and talking about people who you thought couldn't

39:32.220 --> 39:36.820
defend themselves. Many people will just see how far you can push yourself, and I sure

39:36.820 --> 39:40.940
as hell hope you turn us around, for everyone's sake, because I don't see many positive

39:40.940 --> 39:45.580
outcomes from this situation as it is. To the audience, having idols for weight loss

39:45.580 --> 39:50.540
is important, it's sometimes hard, and I really do deeply empathise with that struggle,

39:50.540 --> 39:54.900
but Anne Boleyn Reid is not an idol, and the fact that she might be quote trying is not

39:54.900 --> 39:58.900
really a defence against the very serious criticism she is facing down, because it's

39:58.900 --> 40:03.940
clear there is a level of consciousness to what she's doing. I just want people to get

40:03.940 --> 40:06.220
better.

40:06.220 --> 40:10.820
So yeah, there's the video. Passionate, passionate, passionate, I hope the passion came across.

40:10.820 --> 40:16.260
I would love to give a big shoutout to the editors, they have done a fantastic job, stellar

40:16.260 --> 40:20.780
stellar job my friends. Make sure you follow them, check out their videos, some of them

40:20.780 --> 40:24.480
are very tanned to people who are definitely going places, and one day they'll look back

40:24.480 --> 40:30.540
and they'll say I edited for that idiot once. Also, big shoutout to my Patreons, they're

40:30.540 --> 40:38.500
up on the screen now, and special shoutout to my $50 Patreons, Connor, great chap, and

40:38.500 --> 40:43.680
some hullabaloo, whose name should be correctly spelt this time, I apologise sincerely for

40:43.680 --> 40:48.540
my terrible error first time round. Also, one more $50 Patreon evening steal, who has

40:48.540 --> 40:54.500
only recently signed up, thank you very much, all you $50 Patreons are beautiful people,

40:54.500 --> 41:02.220
much love. And also to my $100 Patreons, Ryan and Brandon, who have blessed me with their

41:02.220 --> 41:26.420
generosity.

41:32.220 --> 41:45.940
Thank you.
