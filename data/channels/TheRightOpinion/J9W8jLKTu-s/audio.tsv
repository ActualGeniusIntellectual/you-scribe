0	16000	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
16000	20360	too much free time, and honestly, weight is not something I've touched on that often,
20360	23840	despite it being a pretty common topic in discussion all over the internet, because
23840	27540	in case it hasn't been apparent, the whole concern surrounding obesity has been one of
27540	32300	the problems arising over the last few decades. With a shift in culture made by many people,
32300	36380	it appears that access to consumption and sedentary lifestyle has created what many
36380	41620	view as an epidemic, particularly in countries like the US where obesity has ballooned. There
41620	45900	are many reasons for why this is considered to have happened, and there are many hypotheses,
45900	51700	but at the end of the day, what we can confirm is that obesity exists, and with the existence
51700	57380	of fat people comes the existence of fat YouTubers. Obese, overweight YouTubers are nothing
57380	61040	particularly new. You're dealing with a platform that is based online, many people
61040	64940	on the platform aren't the most active, and some people might even find appeal within
64940	74580	their great weight. However, from this transpired a new genre, this mainly revolved around weight
74580	78780	loss. The reasons should be fairly obvious, we as viewers typically look for some element
78780	82260	of ourselves in the creator, whether that's something we currently have, or whether that's
82260	86500	something we aspire to be. Now, when you have a weight loss YouTuber, this is someone that
86500	91140	we should follow their journey with, we find inspiration in their progress, maybe you're
91140	95120	an overweight person yourself, but at the same time you're an introvert or an agoraphobe,
95120	98680	and you don't want to show your body at a Weight Watchers meeting. Maybe those people
98680	103180	online can give some advice on how to lose weight from the realms off the screen. Although
103180	107980	it may not be sufficient to make you lose weight on its own, they may provide that inspiration,
107980	111820	may provide you with that extra motivation, and then you can maybe document your journey
111820	115900	online too, and inspire other people to come along with you. The problem is that this vision
115940	120020	doesn't always happen, and sometimes people themselves aren't strong enough to create
120020	124100	that arc through their own volition, and thus the story changes very significantly, and
124100	128580	because they're documenting all of it on YouTube, suddenly this augments into something much
128580	134100	uglier and we can see a bigger, scarier picture. This is where we reach today's creator, the
134100	138300	creator known as Amblin Reed. It was a late evening, and I had worked on a video only
138300	142340	to make the decision that actually, although I wasn't a fan of the creator's content, there
142340	146240	wasn't enough to follow through on it, so I decided to watch a few videos. I knew one
146240	150340	of my fellow creators known as Danaki had released a couple of uploads on these YouTubers
150340	154340	who were rather notorious for the handling of their weight on the platform, and so in
154340	158380	my crisis I decided to sit down and watch them, and although he was a tad too insulting
158380	162580	for my rather polite demeanour, he touched on some very important points that I definitely
162580	167180	feel could be expanded on in a right opinion video. His content definitely does a great
167180	171500	job at individually calling out the YouTubers in question, but what is there beneath the
171500	172500	surface?
172500	176900	Let's talk about the YouTuber of the day. This is Amblin Reed. She is a 28-year-old
176900	181340	YouTuber from the United States of America. She recently became a target for a lot of
181340	186500	YouTubers for a multitude of reasons. Typically, the cycle consists of her doing something,
186500	190500	people reacting, people noting her rather counterproductive efforts to lose weight,
190500	194500	people noting various other negative traits such as her apparent compulsion to lie and
194500	198820	deceive her audience, and alleged manipulation of certain situations. Hell, there is a whole
198820	204140	channel dedicated to exposing Amblin. That is some spicy commitment, considering that
204140	208340	many of these videos receive more views than Amber's videos themselves.
208340	212120	Amblin appears to be a dubious character for more reasons than just her weight, and although
212120	215840	I do consider many of them valid criticisms and would definitely implore people to look
215840	219400	into them, that will typically be a secondary narrative of this video, because although
219400	222940	I will definitely touch on that, there's a lot of detail to these stories that I think
222940	228040	you can only really see from the testimonies, and I don't plan on addressing all of those,
228040	231900	although if you are interested, I'll definitely reference and link some of the more controversial
231900	235880	incidents sooner or later on in the video, because there is a lot to cover.
235880	241260	One term that I saw thrown around a lot was the word lolcow. This is a strange word, and
241260	245360	one that I have only encountered rather recently, but rather often relating to this specific
245360	249000	case. I thought it might be a derogatory term relating to her size, but in fact, it's
249000	253120	a catch-all phrase that explains an individual whose behaviour is being mocked and yet is
253120	257360	completely oblivious to it, and they continue to behave in this way, but I'm not sure
257360	261800	that's completely the case. In the past few months, Amblin's channel has grown significantly,
261800	265600	and this has essentially snowballed, which has brought her the attention of many commentators
265600	269120	who have decided to call her out, and yet in spite of this, she has persisted, paying
269120	273360	little attention, or just doing the classic YouTuber blocking out the haters technique.
273360	277080	However, none of these antics are particularly new, and anyone who's been along for the
277080	281720	ride will be aware of that. However, how long has it really been going on for?
281720	286200	Today's video will discuss the rise of Amblin Reed, and why her appeal is rather different
286200	291360	than many others, and explain what this means for both her, and many of her peers. From
291360	294880	what I've seen, a lot of the videos so far is that they do a great job at presenting
294880	299000	these various incidents that, in a way, don't seem too connected, but I'd argue there
299000	303760	is a connection that we can put together, so join me in the right opinion as we take
303760	310960	a dive into the very twisted reality of Amblin Reed. Let's go.
310960	316560	Amblin Reed opened her channel on YouTube on the 17th of September 2011. However, she
316560	322360	didn't start posting until two years later, the 17th of November 2013. This first video
322360	326600	was an interesting one, because it showed Amblin without a cause, exactly.
327240	335360	I think making these YouTube videos, it might make me accountable. I just think it would
335360	346520	really help me. I watch so many people who make videos, and they're so inspirational.
346520	352420	Maybe I could be an inspiration for somebody. I don't know. I'm not really doing this
352420	356520	for other people, and more so doing it for myself, but if I can help somebody along the
356520	360800	way, then that's even better.
360800	364880	When we open our YouTube channels, it's fairly typical that we don't know how to
364880	369200	provide an introduction, and yet in this video, in many ways, you could see how things might
369200	374360	take shape in a positive direction. Weight loss creators, in many ways, are very polished,
374360	379120	well-produced individuals with a clear plan, and it sells in a way. You throw in some inspirational
379120	383480	music, a riling speech, and you might end up with a Fousey-esque sort of video, which
383480	387640	even though isn't my cup of tea, it is a lot of people's, especially the internet
387640	388640	casuals.
388640	399280	To understand where I'm at, you have to understand where I started from. A couple
399280	407040	of years ago, I was in the best shape of my life. Mentally, physically, and spiritually.
407040	411440	Never mind, we've already got that. The thing is, that in spite of all this, I can
411440	416560	see the appeal of the more insecure individual, putting their story up on websites for the
416560	421120	world to see, and I think that it's important that people like that are represented. That's
421120	425680	the most real you're gonna get. And that's the thing, what you see right here is a different
425680	430480	person, the whole mentality, how she thinks of herself. There is no real agenda here,
430480	435440	no real plot right now, it's just a person documenting their life. That is classic YouTube.
435440	439360	In fact, although I wouldn't necessarily say that her videos are exactly the epitome
439360	443840	of a vlog, she brands herself as a vlogging channel, and they're characterised by that
443840	448560	sort of journey, but never having too much of a purpose, just having a little arc inside
448560	449560	the video.
449560	452880	And this is the thing, although it's very niche and not exactly something that masses
452880	457480	of audiences are gonna see in YouTube trending because it isn't done up all nicely, I can
457480	461760	see how this content would be important for some people, and judging by a couple of the
461760	466120	comments, it clearly was. One of the biggest problems is that people often feel like they're
466120	469960	alone in their experiences, and therefore it's important that people who do have the
469960	474240	courage to speak about them maybe should, although of course it's their own discretion.
474240	478200	And although Anne Boleyn's channel was inherently bleak in its tone, when you talk about your
478200	482440	quote past, it comes with the implication that it's in the past, and there is this notion
482440	486700	of being able to move forward. Now I'm going to discuss why eventually Anne Boleyn's decision
486700	491320	of her channel direction would soon show these videos in a problematic light, but honestly,
491320	495760	videos like An Emotional Look Into My Past back then without the turn in her content
495800	498680	would've been powerful videos for some people at the time.
498680	506080	So this video is going to be about my childhood and what led me up to where I am now, and
506080	507880	I hope you stick around to watch it.
507880	511580	While she was doing this, she'd do like this weekly weigh in where she would keep her subscribers
511580	515540	up to date with exactly how her weight was heading. Now it seems that typically when
515540	520720	she started a channel, it fluctuated around the 360s, pounds that is, which for any of
520720	526880	you metric lads is around 160kg. Sometimes these weigh ins went well, other times they
526880	527880	didn't.
527880	531980	But the only person I can really blame it on is me. I put the food on the fork and put
531980	535660	it in my mouth. It's that simple. It is that simple completely.
535660	539860	And with her earlier channel days, her response seemed genuine, and it seemed genuine in a
539860	544480	way that it didn't have to gain anything from its audience. There wasn't any overwhelming
544480	548380	success and when she did put on weight, she held her hands up and said that she could
548380	552400	do better. She'd talk about the time when she'd lose weight, 89 pounds to be exact,
552400	572180	to give that hope and motivation.
572180	577280	None of it seemed like the content that people are observing today. It seems completely different.
577280	581540	Her diet was very back and forth, but a lot of the time, the food she did present was
581540	587800	alright if we can date the start of the channel at around 2013. By April 2014, her weight
587800	603800	was pretty similar.
603800	608340	I make this observation, I say it's important, because I think it's necessary to understand
608340	613040	the context and present to you the dilemma. It seems apparent to me that unless she is
613040	617300	one of the most calculated creators in the history of YouTube, she didn't start the
617300	622000	channel with the intent of amassing the weight she has now. In fact, honestly, very little
622000	626420	change in weight is one of the very common outcomes for many people trying to lose weight.
626420	631280	The content was not dramatic, the content was not created with the antagonistic intent
631280	635680	that we'll witness later. That means something has happened in her life that has changed
635680	640060	her mentality towards this career path. And listen, she's lousy at keeping to goals,
640060	643900	and clearly incompetent at points, without a doubt, and the cycle that people talk about
643900	648920	is still here, but she seems to believe what she says even if it's just in the moment.
648920	653300	And that's the difference a lot of people seem to identify with her earlier content
653300	655120	just looking at the comment sections.
655120	659060	So thus far, I hope I've made the point with regards to this individual. If you feel like
659060	662960	you need to go watch more of her channel and arrange those videos from oldest to newest,
662960	666260	and hopefully you'll see the perspective that I'm presenting right now. With this
666260	670980	in mind, I want to go forward and see if we can put a date on any change in her behaviour.
670980	674260	So my journey continued, October 2014.
674260	684380	And I'm down. I weighed in at 362.0. So I'm down 4.8 pounds.
684380	686180	February 2015.
686180	691300	February 9, 2015. My starting weight is 388.8.
691300	692300	May 2015.
692300	700560	I weighed in today at 405.2. It's bittersweet. I wish I was at my lowest weight still. Can't
700560	702040	keep holding on to that.
702040	723840	And here we have it. This is the start of Amblin's slippery slope into weight oblivion.
723840	728640	When I look at YouTubers, I find it very interesting to see if they've just snatched, or if it
728640	733200	was a gradual disintegration of their persona. And to question what the causation of that
733200	737400	was, as we've seen here, it's quite apparent that at the start of these videos, there was
737400	742840	some semblance of aim or goal, and by the end, it's fallen apart, as observed by multiple
742840	743840	commentators.
743840	747540	This is certainly a process that has elapsed over time. However, the time where this was
747540	753240	initiated was 2015, and this was a bad year for Amblin in general. However, what I noticed
753240	757800	is that although she may be still rather softly spoken, a lot of her rhetoric doesn't feel
757800	763040	as genuine anymore. For example, she's still using the 89 pound story a lot, but it now
763040	765800	feels like a deflection rather than self-assurance.
793040	812560	Although it's important to keep in mind one's achievements to remind them of their
812560	817620	capability, the repetition that Amblin creates constantly seems like a self-justification
817620	821520	mechanism to try and hold on to something that she's clearly having trouble retaining.
821520	825240	Do I believe the story? Well, that's something that we'll reach soon, but the problem is,
825240	829780	believe it or not, it's not relevant, and in fact promotes an unhealthy mindset that
829780	835200	masquerades the problem in previous accomplishments. Equally, this is where you get to see a rise
835200	838320	in that cycle that we've observed from many other commentators.
838320	864520	And listen, it's fairly normal for someone to try a diet, then give up because it's not
864520	868920	working out for them. Amblin is definitely towards the extreme end of the bell curve
868920	873600	for failed diets, but she genuinely may be that weak-willed to follow through. But at
873600	878780	the same time, the sheer number of times this happens makes you start to doubt the legitimacy.
878780	882260	There's a reason for that though, and it's not because she fails the diets, but it's
882260	886920	always because she records and publicises the taking on and the subsequent failure of
886920	888920	the diets in exactly the same way.
916920	933560	The problem is that Amblin doesn't seem to listen
933560	938760	to her own advice, and the shift that we're observing is one that has come from the lack
938760	942440	of change in a way. And I've always said this, one of the greatest ways to generate
942440	948080	views is conflict. Conflict arises constantly, and people have a natural interest. Oh my,
948080	952360	who broke up? Who cheated on who? But with Amblin, the problem was not just the fact
952360	956260	that these conflicts never changed, but her reaction never changed, to the point where
956260	961180	you'd experience déjà vu. These striking similarities, for example, between her breakup
961180	963940	videos were noticed by many audiences.
991180	1000480	And in a way, you'd expect some similarity in the reaction, after all it's the same
1000480	1005600	person and the same life event. But as an audience member, if you are genuinely like
1005600	1009780	what I'd hope an ideal viewer to be, a person rooting for an individual's success in their
1009780	1014240	goals yet critical where necessary, this is going to be exceptionally uncomfortable for
1014240	1018400	you, because as creators we are expected to evolve and move forward, make it personal.
1018400	1022660	The problem was that Amblin's channel began to feel less and less about specific struggles
1022660	1027660	and more like a soap opera where rhetoric and emotional response is valued over actual
1027660	1033200	evolution and actual working towards goals, and personal connection with that viewer in
1033200	1038720	light of that. And everyone knows the success of manufactured content, and with the repetition
1038720	1043860	and similarity, people began to doubt the honesty of Amblin's content. And as I was
1043860	1047800	watching, I did too. You're having this cycle of conflict that generates views, you make
1047800	1051300	a video talking about how it's going to change, this in theory is meant to gain the sympathy
1051300	1055760	of the viewer, it's a moment of respect, you're trying to combat the challenges of your weight,
1055760	1059920	and suddenly you do a video and oh no you've relapsed, and suddenly you've put on another
1059920	1065800	twenty pounds, and it happens again and again and again, it's a downward spiral. On top
1065800	1069840	of this, something that many people haven't spoken about is the fact that videos about
1069840	1074640	gaining weight do numbers, partly because there is this very seedy audience who find
1074640	1078420	that content attractive, you'll see them occasionally in the comments, but a lot of
1078420	1081880	the time I'm sure they don't want to make their presence known. The amount of weight
1081880	1087200	gain content on some websites is concerning. As reasonable human beings, we all have a
1087200	1092360	line we draw for what we deem as a septal justification for a situation occurring. Weight
1092360	1096960	gain can happen, it's happened to me, it'll probably happen to me again, it's difficult
1096960	1101480	sometimes completely monitoring your diet, if you can do that, fair play to you, but
1101480	1106020	sometimes people just can't. The thing is, the ambulance shower relies on her audience
1106020	1110440	having sympathy for her situation, and although we can be reasonable sometimes and listen
1110440	1114440	to people talk about their struggles, when someone says oh I can't stop eating, let me
1114440	1119200	just consume some ben and jerry's, oh woe is me, we become suspicious of that person's
1119200	1124120	actual drive to change their lifestyle. And yes, of course it's important to document
1124120	1128160	your weaknesses, but at the same time you have to know how to frame them, and the titles
1128160	1131920	were becoming more clickbait and it no longer felt like a weight loss channel but more
1131920	1135900	like a channel where the weight becomes part of the gimmick. And that's okay if you want
1135900	1139720	to do that, but you have to understand that all these channels are a journey, and if Anne
1139720	1143600	Boleyn by some miracle lost the weight that she actually claimed she would, the journey
1143600	1147920	would end, and she'd lose the viewers. I mean, people are there for the weight, and
1147920	1152860	if the weight is gone, so is the appeal. Weight loss channels are not known for their longevity,
1152860	1156400	some large youtubers have lost weight but that's different, they established themselves
1156400	1160240	before, you're gonna have a much harder time significantly establishing yourself on
1160240	1164840	the idea of losing weight alone, so by not losing it but yet continuously committing
1164840	1169900	to it, she maintains the limbo of viewer interest. The whole storyline represents a dangerous
1169900	1174600	precedent, the content seems much more self-indulgent than reflective, and here's the thing, it's
1174600	1179800	okay to show weakness, it's okay to be human in your videos, but at the same time you can't
1179800	1184160	glorify those flaws like they're fucking clickbait. And although she never explicitly
1184160	1188200	stated that, she had created content who was implicitly affirming a lifestyle that
1188200	1192280	was counterproductive to the notion of weight loss, and you can see that in her titles,
1192280	1196200	you can see that in her clickbait, you can see that in her presentation, her attitude
1196200	1200320	is changing, and it was only going to get worse for her. Which is where I introduce
1200320	1203280	you to the year that ruined Anne Boleyn Reid.
1214160	1228400	As said, when Anne Boleyn started up her channel, she had a handful of anecdotes that she would
1228400	1232280	throw around here and there, ones about her family, ones about her relationships, ones
1232280	1237080	about her childhood, and how it shaped who she is today, and at the time, they seemed
1237080	1240720	genuine, they didn't seem too dishonest in their presentation, she didn't appear to have
1240720	1245400	too much of a motivation to lie about these circumstances. However, as time went on and
1245400	1250780	people started becoming disinterested in these same stories she would continuously espouse,
1250780	1255840	she decided to do two things. Firstly, she made her own stories. This was done by generating
1255840	1260600	melodrama throughout her vlogs, but also she retold stories that seemed less likely and
1260600	1264920	more dishonest, and just involved downright lying to justify what might be considered
1265920	1272160	For example, she claims that she's bipolar, or was bipolar, or probably is bipolar. It
1272160	1276760	seems like she's not quite sure. Or what about that time that she was diagnosed with binge
1276760	1281240	eating disorder back in 2007?
1281240	1289720	When it comes to scrambled eggs, I'm gonna be honest, they sometimes make me feel nauseous,
1289720	1292640	and it's because I have an allergy to them.
1292640	1293640	How do you like your eggs?
1294360	1300160	This escalated to a point where she made a video addressing the multiple lies, some of
1300160	1303520	which were fairly harmless, others not so much.
1303520	1309080	So if you guys remember my aunt situation, this was a while ago though. This was probably,
1309080	1314560	I don't know, it was months ago. Months, to be honest. When I uploaded a video about
1314560	1323040	how my aunt doesn't talk to me anymore because I'm fat. I was vulnerable and I was upset
1323040	1330360	and I really felt like blaming my weight on everything was just like the easiest way
1330360	1341200	to go. And if she's watching this, I am so sorry and I really just, I wish I could change
1341200	1346120	who I am as a person. Because I really want my aunt back.
1346120	1351600	My weight, I wouldn't say I've lied to you guys per se about it, but I definitely haven't
1351600	1360960	been like very into like telling you guys my weight. I'm fluctuating a lot. Okay, so
1360960	1369960	something else I've lied about is the job I had in Florida. I told you guys that I was
1369960	1379680	a PCA worker at assisted living facility full time and I wasn't. I was a PCA worker at assisted
1379680	1385960	living facility, but I was not full time. I did not want to live off of destiny. And
1385960	1390240	when I was living in Florida at the beginning, I did not make enough money on YouTube. I
1390240	1395400	lied about that. I did not make enough money on YouTube to support us. Something else I've
1395400	1400280	lied about is my blood pressure. On several occasions, I have said I don't have diabetes.
1400280	1404920	I don't have high blood pressure. I don't have high cholesterol. I don't have this or
1404920	1412320	whatever. All of that is true, besides the blood pressure. I don't have high blood pressure,
1412320	1414520	but I have borderline high blood pressure.
1414520	1418720	The problem was that these lines were escalating further and further, and when you're a person
1418720	1422480	with only so much to you like Anne Blinn Reid, you're going to have a limited scope in your
1422480	1427360	ability to captivate the audiences. So what can you do apart from exacerbate already existent
1427360	1431660	drama? And this was already hurting people such as that relationship with her aunt, whether
1431660	1435760	those tears were real or not, you get the feeling that either way someone's losing out
1435760	1439940	on a possibly beneficial relationship if it existed. And at the end of the day, I feel
1439940	1444020	that Anne Blinn is probably needing that more than anyone else in this situation. And first
1444020	1447720	of all, I just want to say that's the sad thing about these lines. Anne Blinn thinks
1447720	1452020	she can put on a brave face, shed a few tears and use that to gain audience sympathy. But
1452020	1457420	all she's doing is undoing any flavor of genuineness her old content once had with the drama that
1457420	1462300	followed the year after. You not only threw any audience bond into contention, but all
1462300	1466540	those people who might have once said, wow, that's so relatable. I feel that way too.
1466540	1470740	And now questioning themselves because you've turned out to be rather disreputable in your
1470740	1474900	behavior. This is the thing. I wanted to show a more sympathetic side of Anne Blinn Reid
1474900	1479160	so that we can now contrast that with what she has become. In her old video, she was
1479160	1483240	more restrained and arguably less emotive. And that actually worked because when you're
1483240	1488000	not forcing anything, it doesn't feel like you're trying to push any emotion or deceive
1488000	1493120	your audience. One thing I noticed is that Anne Blinn actually became much more disingenuous
1493120	1497440	because her character became much more extroverted, much more expressive, and it felt like she
1497440	1502200	was constantly trying to sell her audience a message, an agenda, and these regularly
1502200	1503200	conflicted.
1503200	1508160	YouTube rewards gluttony, clickbait, and trainwrecks, and you can probably tell that this is what
1508160	1512640	she cares about now, given the amount of ads she puts on, it's borderline parody. And
1512680	1518240	I'll save that point for the end, because her lies escalated in the summer of 2016 in
1518240	1523980	a very interesting move where she decided to try and extend or revive that deep relationship
1523980	1528660	which she had done in the past by talking about her past. But she decided that she was
1528660	1532600	going to lay claim to the story about an abusive partner.
1532600	1536640	Now experiences that have happened in our lives can be very difficult to talk about,
1536640	1540640	mainly because of the emotional trauma that we may have experienced due to it. However,
1540640	1545320	if you speak about a person who may no longer be there, or may not be aware that you're
1545320	1550060	speaking about them, or may not have the platform to defend themselves, it is also very easy
1550060	1554680	for your claims to go unchallenged, and therefore much of the judgement comes down to perception.
1554680	1559020	I know that I can't necessarily prove many of the things that I've spoken about that
1559020	1563400	happened to me in my childhood, and therefore it comes down to personal credibility.
1563400	1567400	And in some ways this seems like a smart idea on Anne Blinn's part, because someone of
1567400	1571680	her calibre at this point seems immoral enough to purposely talk about these subjects without
1571680	1576100	fear of repercussions, because if you deny it, you're denying her traumatic experience.
1576100	1581200	How dare you? How dare you do that? You see, it seems like a safe move on her part, but
1581200	1582200	it wasn't.
1582200	1587120	Her favourite spot was my stomach. She would punch me really hard in my stomach. She punched
1587120	1593580	me around right here a lot. She would punch me on my arms, and she would continuously
1593580	1597780	do it until I agreed to make love to her, or have sex, whatever you want to consider
1597780	1598780	it.
1598780	1603180	No, in fact her ex-partner Casey, who was identifying as a female during the original
1603180	1609260	relationship as Cassidy, released a video documenting his experiences with Amblin, refuting
1609260	1612260	her claims and arguing that he was the victim of the abuse.
1612260	1619780	I've gotten hit before. I went to school with bruises up and down my arms. Bruises.
1619780	1626580	My friends asked me, what's wrong? What happened to you? Eventually they figured it out. So
1626580	1637060	every time I would come to school upset, in tears, bruised, on my arms, hands, cuts, scars,
1637060	1640600	amber again.
1640600	1645900	Much of this comes down to one word against another, so in many ways Amblin had many opportunities
1645900	1650240	to respond to his claims. Maybe she'd argue, maybe she'd bring some evidence forward,
1650240	1653780	but no, she just removed her original video and kept quiet.
1653780	1658000	However there is a re-upload which can quite clearly show how manipulative she is if our
1658000	1661820	judgement of these events is correct. She hooks the audience in with that anecdote of
1661820	1666540	her parents, and how intimate this was to her, and then leads into this elaborate story
1666540	1669040	about her experience.
1669040	1672700	The one thing that she did do was this very strange poetry reading, which I suppose was
1672700	1676780	meant to be some kind of cryptic response, but that's the best she can do. She's
1676780	1680140	trying to be in a position of vagueness so that the person can't respond.
1680140	1686220	Rain and petals eavesdrop, I used the wrong word. Rain and petals eavesdrop, I used the
1686220	1691700	wrong word. Rain and petals eavesdrop, I used the wrong word. My mental hygiene has been
1691700	1693220	rotten and stirred.
1693220	1697800	Not quite Tennyson, is it? And that's another thing I wanted to note. Amblin seems to use
1697800	1702140	these tropes like poetry and literature that are typically seen as channeling one's feelings
1702140	1707860	into a higher emotive plane to circumvent criticism and try and add depth to her character.
1707860	1712300	Using art to convey false feelings is extremely manipulative because we typically look to
1712300	1716940	the implicit messages of art to indirectly convey the character of a person that they
1716940	1722060	may not express directly. It's like an outlet, so that we may look back and one day say,
1722060	1726900	oh what a troubled mind. But Amblin takes advantage of that and she tries to convey
1726900	1731620	sentiments that aren't really true, and now she's trying to portray experiences that
1731620	1735020	aren't really true. Fortunately, people saw through it.
1735020	1740220	And this is the thing, if this was true, this is the most vulnerable and open you can get,
1740220	1744580	and let me explain why that's important. If I am late to some appointments, some people
1744580	1748780	might not trust me when I commit to arriving at a certain time, but they might still trust
1748780	1752580	me if I decide to talk about more personal matters because they will assume that you
1752580	1757100	have a degree of respect for the sensitivity of those subjects and will not take advantage
1757100	1762340	of them for personal gain. This is exactly what Amblin has done, and thus she has sacrificed
1762340	1766740	all of her credibility. You cannot trust her when she tries to open up about more personal
1766740	1771560	content in the future, and it brings into question everything she's ever spoken about.
1771560	1776260	What if this content that once bonded people was just a fraud all along? I don't know
1776260	1781020	if it was all a fraud because I don't know if she had the same goal at the start of her
1781020	1784960	channel, but I'm sure that's what it's descended to now, and it's genuinely sad
1784960	1789100	that the few people that she may have given hope to at one point have probably seen that
1789100	1794280	desolated by a fame-driven appeal to a populace who are watching a train wreck.
1794280	1799240	2016 was also the year that introduced her to Mukbang. By now she'd already started
1799240	1803140	doing food reviews, which clearly wasn't a good decision, but Mukbang was really the
1803140	1807180	straw that broke the camel's back, and I think that's what annoyed a lot of people.
1807180	1811840	The simple fact is that no one who is actively trying to lose weight can simultaneously create
1811840	1815360	a fantastic brand of eating large amounts of food in one sitting, unless it's sesame
1815360	1819200	seeds. The only way you could do that is if you were exercising an equal amount of time
1819200	1823460	to burn off the calories, which Amblin was clearly not doing, but it gave her some of
1823460	1827960	the best views in her career, so who cared, and it made her put on weight, and then she
1827960	1831240	could bring attention to her weight which also generated views, and you create this
1831240	1836240	cycle that runs again, and again, and again. But this channel shouldn't be about views,
1836620	1839620	it's about Amblin, and there are so many problems to observe here.
1846620	1850720	I can't speak for everyone here, but I've often found my behaviour a somewhat conscious
1850720	1854360	response to the environment around me. When I have found myself in situations where my
1854360	1860320	reputation might be viewed badly by those in my circle, I have an option to work hard
1860320	1864820	to realign that view of me, or I could fall into fulfilling what they view of me and not
1864820	1868860	bother what they think. I've often worked hard to take the former option because firstly
1868860	1872820	because I'm a paranoid person who does enjoy being on good terms with those around me,
1872820	1877060	and secondly because I think it's a better thing to do, it's a more positive impact.
1877060	1881380	Being self-conscious isn't a blessing in some ways, it causes a lot of stress in social
1881380	1886660	situations, but at the same time being self-aware is important, because you not just look after
1886660	1891180	yourself, but you look after the message that you might be portraying to your audience.
1892180	1898340	I feel that in this situation, Amblin has eventually found herself in so much drama
1898340	1902940	and found it so profitable that she has completely disregarded on her. That has made her more
1902940	1908020	audacious, outgoing, and perhaps even confident, but it also makes her more fake, more toxic,
1908020	1912380	and more destructive. When she half-heartedly tries to create a bond with any viewers that
1912380	1916260	might actually be there for her personality, which I'm highly doubtful of, she's found
1916260	1920700	it much easier to fall into the worst perception that people have of her rather than actively
1920740	1925460	challenging it. As her personality has changed, so has her lifestyle, and she put on more
1925460	1930020	and more weight, while supposedly lamenting it. In my opinion, although they don't receive
1930020	1933820	much airtime in developing their character, she has surrounded herself with people who
1933820	1937180	don't challenge that mentality and may actually affirm it.
1951700	1956340	Studies show that you're much more likely to conform to those around you in person than
1956340	1960740	if they're impersonal, like over the web, or over the phone. In the original video,
1960740	1964220	she's clearly much more conscious about what people think, but now she's clearly
1964220	1968500	comfortable in her real-life situation, and that's all she sees herself as having to
1968500	1972880	answer to now. There's a load of pointing fingers about who's caused who to gain weight
1972880	1977420	and so on, and I don't know who is doing what specifically, I don't know what goes
1977420	1982460	on behind the scenes exactly other than it involves food. What I do know is that it's
1982460	1986860	happening, and regardless of the excuses that Amblin tries to spew, she has put on a significant
1986860	1991300	amount of weight, weight that when we look at her old content, she didn't put on, and
1991300	1995060	she didn't put it on for a while. This was content that regardless of whether you believe
1995060	1999760	it was legitimate or not, showed that Amblin doesn't have the world's slowest metabolism
1999760	2003640	and can't do anything at all to prevent her weight gain. In the last couple years,
2003640	2007340	the amount of hate she's been receiving has steadily increased, probably due to people
2007340	2012720	calling out that cycle. And yet, I think by going through that cycle, she has just found
2012720	2016660	herself falling further and further into it, and she has responded to this by doing these
2016660	2021380	reading hate comments. This successfully alienates herself from the audience and the genuine
2021380	2026160	criticism that she might be receiving. Whether people's tone is right or not does not discount
2026160	2030480	the genuine problems here. She attributes the criticism to the fact that she is fat.
2030480	2046560	And not the fact that she has continuously failed to sort herself out, despite the fact
2046560	2050800	that she's acknowledged this many times before so much that people don't believe that she
2050800	2072760	is taking her own criticism seriously.
2072760	2076840	There are so many videos documenting these constant contradictions, that one can be found
2076840	2081240	on the Binge Monsters channel, I'll leave it in the pinned comment. And I think how
2081240	2085960	the thought of just firstly her lack of care in these actions, and then the thought that
2085960	2090640	she recorded, edited and uploaded it, with the thought that this is a good message to
2090640	2095980	be sending, it doesn't feel real. It feels like she's taking advantage, and then the
2095980	2100680	next day she'll express regret, which will just seem as insincere. Her attitude just
2100680	2105760	screams to me, someone who doesn't care anymore. Whatever there was in the past just isn't
2105760	2110040	there, and I think that's the most dishonest factor that comes into this, is the fact that
2110040	2114960	she still wants to care, and now all she does is cater to people who want to watch the disaster
2114960	2121520	unfold and count up those pounds, 400 pounds, 500 pounds, approaching 600 pounds, which
2121520	2125040	would be around 270 kilograms.
2125040	2129600	I think Anne Boleyn came onto YouTube for the weight loss, I mean in her old video she
2129600	2133880	said she wanted to do this because she wanted an audience to hold her accountable, but the
2133880	2137880	problem is that when that audience decided to hold it into account, regardless of whether
2137880	2142760	they may have been hostile or not, she clearly didn't handle it well, and YouTube became
2142760	2147680	about a different goal, she realised that she could foster that hostility, and garner
2147680	2153040	more views. She shifted the responsibility of her diet onto the audience response, and
2153040	2158840	since has continued to gain weight, at a rate that has not been noted before on her channel,
2158840	2163120	continuously committing to change but failing, and now whenever she has those solemn speeches
2163160	2167200	where she promises to do better, it feels like a political ruse rather than actually
2167200	2171940	any genuine commitment, even if in the early days her commitments were futile, it felt
2171940	2176560	like she believed them at the time. Does she really believe them now? I hope she does,
2176560	2180600	but if she does change, it will not be with the mindset that she currently has, which
2180600	2185160	is a self-destructive one, if she really does care about getting her weight down, then she
2185160	2189520	has to change, if she doesn't want to lose weight, well there's nothing I can say to
2189520	2193760	her. With regards to that on principle, it's not what I'd recommend, and you're putting
2193760	2199000	an awful lot of stress onto an already struggling healthcare system, but at the same time, you
2199000	2204000	need to stop promoting this arc, this cycle, to possibly vulnerable people that your mentality
2204000	2208580	is justifiable to someone who might want to lose weight, even though you apparently want
2208580	2212540	to lose weight. To a majority of the audience, it might seem obvious that this is not the
2212540	2216480	way that someone should live, but there will always be people who are questioning their
2216480	2220480	own responsibility, and although it's definitely possible that some people are weaker than
2220480	2225040	others, because your situation is not like any other Amberlynn, you have an audience
2225040	2230360	that is now watching a person, and counting up their weight until something terrible happens,
2230360	2234440	and you're placing 8 mid-roll ads, and you're probably making a decent amount of money from
2234440	2238880	that, other people don't have that, so don't try and frame your mentality from a moral
2238880	2242980	standpoint because most other people who might be in a similar weight position don't have
2242980	2247540	all these motivations that have become so obvious in your recent content, they do not
2247540	2252680	have that safety net. I mean, come on, look at those mid-rolls. And the list of stuff
2252680	2257020	she does goes on and on and on, and it's not worth documenting them all right now because
2257020	2261740	at the end of the day, they can be explained by the mentality we've discussed. More lying,
2261740	2266320	animal maltreatment, some kind of pyramid scheme. She apparently created a fake account
2266320	2271460	to defend herself from criticism in a Facebook and apparently Discord group too. It's genuinely
2271460	2275260	frustrating because whether she was genuine in her first videos or not, it's clear they
2275260	2280780	meant something to people, and now it's just come to here, and I wish it hadn't. Do you
2280780	2285580	know how many puns I can make now? But you see, I'm a man of refrain, because I accept
2285580	2289340	that life is not easy, and when we deal with serious problems in our lives, we might let
2289340	2293500	go of some of the things that we are meant to take care of, but at the same time, it's
2293500	2298220	important that we acknowledge the consequences our actions might have, and I think that's
2298220	2302460	what bothers people. You're a public figure. There is this mentality that people are gonna
2302460	2306820	hate on you just because you're fat, and sure, a few people are like that, but at the
2306820	2311600	same time, being overweight does promote an insecurity in many people, and I think you
2311600	2316500	understand that insecurity too. Your old videos definitely seem that way. Other YouTube related
2316500	2320780	factors that you might be experiencing may override that now, but that's not the case
2320780	2325180	for anyone else that you're sending these messages to. You are the exception, not the
2325180	2330140	rule. In our first ever video, Anne Boleyn says she's doing this for herself.
2330140	2333820	I'm not really doing this for other people, I'm more so doing it for myself.
2333820	2338320	It's clear what that means to her now. This is the problem. Anne Boleyn cannot stop the
2338320	2343580	cycle of failure, and food, and consumption, or else she will lose her subscribers regardless
2343580	2347860	of their motivation to stay, and she'll continue to push herself further and further until
2347860	2351420	something terrible happens, and she loses that audience that she gained in the first
2351420	2355460	place, and all she'll be left with is a lot of weight, and the security is gone, and
2355460	2360080	all that drama, all that deception that you took part in that hurt people, the clearly
2360080	2364420	affected people, would be for nothing. You're on thin ice as it is. People don't stick
2364420	2368260	around for the credibility because they know you have none of that. You've destroyed
2368260	2372220	that for the sake of clickbait and views, and talking about people who you thought couldn't
2372220	2376820	defend themselves. Many people will just see how far you can push yourself, and I sure
2376820	2380940	as hell hope you turn us around, for everyone's sake, because I don't see many positive
2380940	2385580	outcomes from this situation as it is. To the audience, having idols for weight loss
2385580	2390540	is important, it's sometimes hard, and I really do deeply empathise with that struggle,
2390540	2394900	but Anne Boleyn Reid is not an idol, and the fact that she might be quote trying is not
2394900	2398900	really a defence against the very serious criticism she is facing down, because it's
2398900	2403940	clear there is a level of consciousness to what she's doing. I just want people to get
2403940	2406220	better.
2406220	2410820	So yeah, there's the video. Passionate, passionate, passionate, I hope the passion came across.
2410820	2416260	I would love to give a big shoutout to the editors, they have done a fantastic job, stellar
2416260	2420780	stellar job my friends. Make sure you follow them, check out their videos, some of them
2420780	2424480	are very tanned to people who are definitely going places, and one day they'll look back
2424480	2430540	and they'll say I edited for that idiot once. Also, big shoutout to my Patreons, they're
2430540	2438500	up on the screen now, and special shoutout to my $50 Patreons, Connor, great chap, and
2438500	2443680	some hullabaloo, whose name should be correctly spelt this time, I apologise sincerely for
2443680	2448540	my terrible error first time round. Also, one more $50 Patreon evening steal, who has
2448540	2454500	only recently signed up, thank you very much, all you $50 Patreons are beautiful people,
2454500	2462220	much love. And also to my $100 Patreons, Ryan and Brandon, who have blessed me with their
2462220	2486420	generosity.
2492220	2505940	Thank you.
