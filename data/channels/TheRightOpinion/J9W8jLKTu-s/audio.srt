00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,360
too much free time, and honestly, weight is not something I've touched on that often,

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,840
despite it being a pretty common topic in discussion all over the internet, because

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,540
in case it hasn't been apparent, the whole concern surrounding obesity has been one of

5
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,300
the problems arising over the last few decades. With a shift in culture made by many people,

6
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,380
it appears that access to consumption and sedentary lifestyle has created what many

7
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,620
view as an epidemic, particularly in countries like the US where obesity has ballooned. There

8
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,900
are many reasons for why this is considered to have happened, and there are many hypotheses,

9
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:51,700
but at the end of the day, what we can confirm is that obesity exists, and with the existence

10
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:57,380
of fat people comes the existence of fat YouTubers. Obese, overweight YouTubers are nothing

11
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:01,040
particularly new. You're dealing with a platform that is based online, many people

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,940
on the platform aren't the most active, and some people might even find appeal within

13
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:14,580
their great weight. However, from this transpired a new genre, this mainly revolved around weight

14
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,780
loss. The reasons should be fairly obvious, we as viewers typically look for some element

15
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,260
of ourselves in the creator, whether that's something we currently have, or whether that's

16
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,500
something we aspire to be. Now, when you have a weight loss YouTuber, this is someone that

17
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,140
we should follow their journey with, we find inspiration in their progress, maybe you're

18
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,120
an overweight person yourself, but at the same time you're an introvert or an agoraphobe,

19
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,680
and you don't want to show your body at a Weight Watchers meeting. Maybe those people

20
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,180
online can give some advice on how to lose weight from the realms off the screen. Although

21
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,980
it may not be sufficient to make you lose weight on its own, they may provide that inspiration,

22
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,820
may provide you with that extra motivation, and then you can maybe document your journey

23
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,900
online too, and inspire other people to come along with you. The problem is that this vision

24
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:00,020
doesn't always happen, and sometimes people themselves aren't strong enough to create

25
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,100
that arc through their own volition, and thus the story changes very significantly, and

26
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,580
because they're documenting all of it on YouTube, suddenly this augments into something much

27
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:14,100
uglier and we can see a bigger, scarier picture. This is where we reach today's creator, the

28
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,300
creator known as Amblin Reed. It was a late evening, and I had worked on a video only

29
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,340
to make the decision that actually, although I wasn't a fan of the creator's content, there

30
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,240
wasn't enough to follow through on it, so I decided to watch a few videos. I knew one

31
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,340
of my fellow creators known as Danaki had released a couple of uploads on these YouTubers

32
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,340
who were rather notorious for the handling of their weight on the platform, and so in

33
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,380
my crisis I decided to sit down and watch them, and although he was a tad too insulting

34
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,580
for my rather polite demeanour, he touched on some very important points that I definitely

35
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:47,180
feel could be expanded on in a right opinion video. His content definitely does a great

36
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,500
job at individually calling out the YouTubers in question, but what is there beneath the

37
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,500
surface?

38
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,900
Let's talk about the YouTuber of the day. This is Amblin Reed. She is a 28-year-old

39
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,340
YouTuber from the United States of America. She recently became a target for a lot of

40
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:06,500
YouTubers for a multitude of reasons. Typically, the cycle consists of her doing something,

41
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,500
people reacting, people noting her rather counterproductive efforts to lose weight,

42
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,500
people noting various other negative traits such as her apparent compulsion to lie and

43
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,820
deceive her audience, and alleged manipulation of certain situations. Hell, there is a whole

44
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:24,140
channel dedicated to exposing Amblin. That is some spicy commitment, considering that

45
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,340
many of these videos receive more views than Amber's videos themselves.

46
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,120
Amblin appears to be a dubious character for more reasons than just her weight, and although

47
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,840
I do consider many of them valid criticisms and would definitely implore people to look

48
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,400
into them, that will typically be a secondary narrative of this video, because although

49
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,940
I will definitely touch on that, there's a lot of detail to these stories that I think

50
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:48,040
you can only really see from the testimonies, and I don't plan on addressing all of those,

51
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,900
although if you are interested, I'll definitely reference and link some of the more controversial

52
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,880
incidents sooner or later on in the video, because there is a lot to cover.

53
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,260
One term that I saw thrown around a lot was the word lolcow. This is a strange word, and

54
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,360
one that I have only encountered rather recently, but rather often relating to this specific

55
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,000
case. I thought it might be a derogatory term relating to her size, but in fact, it's

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,120
a catch-all phrase that explains an individual whose behaviour is being mocked and yet is

57
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,360
completely oblivious to it, and they continue to behave in this way, but I'm not sure

58
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,800
that's completely the case. In the past few months, Amblin's channel has grown significantly,

59
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,600
and this has essentially snowballed, which has brought her the attention of many commentators

60
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,120
who have decided to call her out, and yet in spite of this, she has persisted, paying

61
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,360
little attention, or just doing the classic YouTuber blocking out the haters technique.

62
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,080
However, none of these antics are particularly new, and anyone who's been along for the

63
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,720
ride will be aware of that. However, how long has it really been going on for?

64
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,200
Today's video will discuss the rise of Amblin Reed, and why her appeal is rather different

65
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,360
than many others, and explain what this means for both her, and many of her peers. From

66
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,880
what I've seen, a lot of the videos so far is that they do a great job at presenting

67
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,000
these various incidents that, in a way, don't seem too connected, but I'd argue there

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,760
is a connection that we can put together, so join me in the right opinion as we take

69
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:10,960
a dive into the very twisted reality of Amblin Reed. Let's go.

70
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,560
Amblin Reed opened her channel on YouTube on the 17th of September 2011. However, she

71
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,360
didn't start posting until two years later, the 17th of November 2013. This first video

72
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,600
was an interesting one, because it showed Amblin without a cause, exactly.

73
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:35,360
I think making these YouTube videos, it might make me accountable. I just think it would

74
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:46,520
really help me. I watch so many people who make videos, and they're so inspirational.

75
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:52,420
Maybe I could be an inspiration for somebody. I don't know. I'm not really doing this

76
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,520
for other people, and more so doing it for myself, but if I can help somebody along the

77
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,800
way, then that's even better.

78
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,880
When we open our YouTube channels, it's fairly typical that we don't know how to

79
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,200
provide an introduction, and yet in this video, in many ways, you could see how things might

80
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,360
take shape in a positive direction. Weight loss creators, in many ways, are very polished,

81
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,120
well-produced individuals with a clear plan, and it sells in a way. You throw in some inspirational

82
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,480
music, a riling speech, and you might end up with a Fousey-esque sort of video, which

83
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,640
even though isn't my cup of tea, it is a lot of people's, especially the internet

84
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
casuals.

85
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:39,280
To understand where I'm at, you have to understand where I started from. A couple

86
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:47,040
of years ago, I was in the best shape of my life. Mentally, physically, and spiritually.

87
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,440
Never mind, we've already got that. The thing is, that in spite of all this, I can

88
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,560
see the appeal of the more insecure individual, putting their story up on websites for the

89
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,120
world to see, and I think that it's important that people like that are represented. That's

90
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,680
the most real you're gonna get. And that's the thing, what you see right here is a different

91
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,480
person, the whole mentality, how she thinks of herself. There is no real agenda here,

92
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,440
no real plot right now, it's just a person documenting their life. That is classic YouTube.

93
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,360
In fact, although I wouldn't necessarily say that her videos are exactly the epitome

94
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,840
of a vlog, she brands herself as a vlogging channel, and they're characterised by that

95
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,560
sort of journey, but never having too much of a purpose, just having a little arc inside

96
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,560
the video.

97
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,880
And this is the thing, although it's very niche and not exactly something that masses

98
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,480
of audiences are gonna see in YouTube trending because it isn't done up all nicely, I can

99
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,760
see how this content would be important for some people, and judging by a couple of the

100
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,120
comments, it clearly was. One of the biggest problems is that people often feel like they're

101
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,960
alone in their experiences, and therefore it's important that people who do have the

102
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,240
courage to speak about them maybe should, although of course it's their own discretion.

103
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,200
And although Anne Boleyn's channel was inherently bleak in its tone, when you talk about your

104
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,440
quote past, it comes with the implication that it's in the past, and there is this notion

105
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,700
of being able to move forward. Now I'm going to discuss why eventually Anne Boleyn's decision

106
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:11,320
of her channel direction would soon show these videos in a problematic light, but honestly,

107
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,760
videos like An Emotional Look Into My Past back then without the turn in her content

108
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,680
would've been powerful videos for some people at the time.

109
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:26,080
So this video is going to be about my childhood and what led me up to where I am now, and

110
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,880
I hope you stick around to watch it.

111
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,580
While she was doing this, she'd do like this weekly weigh in where she would keep her subscribers

112
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,540
up to date with exactly how her weight was heading. Now it seems that typically when

113
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:40,720
she started a channel, it fluctuated around the 360s, pounds that is, which for any of

114
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,880
you metric lads is around 160kg. Sometimes these weigh ins went well, other times they

115
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,880
didn't.

116
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,980
But the only person I can really blame it on is me. I put the food on the fork and put

117
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,660
it in my mouth. It's that simple. It is that simple completely.

118
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,860
And with her earlier channel days, her response seemed genuine, and it seemed genuine in a

119
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,480
way that it didn't have to gain anything from its audience. There wasn't any overwhelming

120
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,380
success and when she did put on weight, she held her hands up and said that she could

121
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,400
do better. She'd talk about the time when she'd lose weight, 89 pounds to be exact,

122
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:32,180
to give that hope and motivation.

123
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:37,280
None of it seemed like the content that people are observing today. It seems completely different.

124
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,540
Her diet was very back and forth, but a lot of the time, the food she did present was

125
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:47,800
alright if we can date the start of the channel at around 2013. By April 2014, her weight

126
00:09:47,800 --> 00:10:03,800
was pretty similar.

127
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,340
I make this observation, I say it's important, because I think it's necessary to understand

128
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:13,040
the context and present to you the dilemma. It seems apparent to me that unless she is

129
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,300
one of the most calculated creators in the history of YouTube, she didn't start the

130
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:22,000
channel with the intent of amassing the weight she has now. In fact, honestly, very little

131
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,420
change in weight is one of the very common outcomes for many people trying to lose weight.

132
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:31,280
The content was not dramatic, the content was not created with the antagonistic intent

133
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,680
that we'll witness later. That means something has happened in her life that has changed

134
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,060
her mentality towards this career path. And listen, she's lousy at keeping to goals,

135
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,900
and clearly incompetent at points, without a doubt, and the cycle that people talk about

136
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,920
is still here, but she seems to believe what she says even if it's just in the moment.

137
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,300
And that's the difference a lot of people seem to identify with her earlier content

138
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,120
just looking at the comment sections.

139
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,060
So thus far, I hope I've made the point with regards to this individual. If you feel like

140
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,960
you need to go watch more of her channel and arrange those videos from oldest to newest,

141
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,260
and hopefully you'll see the perspective that I'm presenting right now. With this

142
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,980
in mind, I want to go forward and see if we can put a date on any change in her behaviour.

143
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,260
So my journey continued, October 2014.

144
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:24,380
And I'm down. I weighed in at 362.0. So I'm down 4.8 pounds.

145
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,180
February 2015.

146
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:31,300
February 9, 2015. My starting weight is 388.8.

147
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,300
May 2015.

148
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:40,560
I weighed in today at 405.2. It's bittersweet. I wish I was at my lowest weight still. Can't

149
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,040
keep holding on to that.

150
00:11:42,040 --> 00:12:03,840
And here we have it. This is the start of Amblin's slippery slope into weight oblivion.

151
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,640
When I look at YouTubers, I find it very interesting to see if they've just snatched, or if it

152
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,200
was a gradual disintegration of their persona. And to question what the causation of that

153
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,400
was, as we've seen here, it's quite apparent that at the start of these videos, there was

154
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,840
some semblance of aim or goal, and by the end, it's fallen apart, as observed by multiple

155
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,840
commentators.

156
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,540
This is certainly a process that has elapsed over time. However, the time where this was

157
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:33,240
initiated was 2015, and this was a bad year for Amblin in general. However, what I noticed

158
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,800
is that although she may be still rather softly spoken, a lot of her rhetoric doesn't feel

159
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:43,040
as genuine anymore. For example, she's still using the 89 pound story a lot, but it now

160
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,800
feels like a deflection rather than self-assurance.

161
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:32,560
Although it's important to keep in mind one's achievements to remind them of their

162
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,620
capability, the repetition that Amblin creates constantly seems like a self-justification

163
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,520
mechanism to try and hold on to something that she's clearly having trouble retaining.

164
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,240
Do I believe the story? Well, that's something that we'll reach soon, but the problem is,

165
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,780
believe it or not, it's not relevant, and in fact promotes an unhealthy mindset that

166
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:55,200
masquerades the problem in previous accomplishments. Equally, this is where you get to see a rise

167
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,320
in that cycle that we've observed from many other commentators.

168
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:24,520
And listen, it's fairly normal for someone to try a diet, then give up because it's not

169
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,920
working out for them. Amblin is definitely towards the extreme end of the bell curve

170
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,600
for failed diets, but she genuinely may be that weak-willed to follow through. But at

171
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,780
the same time, the sheer number of times this happens makes you start to doubt the legitimacy.

172
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,260
There's a reason for that though, and it's not because she fails the diets, but it's

173
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:46,920
always because she records and publicises the taking on and the subsequent failure of

174
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,920
the diets in exactly the same way.

175
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:33,560
The problem is that Amblin doesn't seem to listen

176
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,760
to her own advice, and the shift that we're observing is one that has come from the lack

177
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,440
of change in a way. And I've always said this, one of the greatest ways to generate

178
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:48,080
views is conflict. Conflict arises constantly, and people have a natural interest. Oh my,

179
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,360
who broke up? Who cheated on who? But with Amblin, the problem was not just the fact

180
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,260
that these conflicts never changed, but her reaction never changed, to the point where

181
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:01,180
you'd experience déjà vu. These striking similarities, for example, between her breakup

182
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,940
videos were noticed by many audiences.

183
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:40,480
And in a way, you'd expect some similarity in the reaction, after all it's the same

184
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,600
person and the same life event. But as an audience member, if you are genuinely like

185
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,780
what I'd hope an ideal viewer to be, a person rooting for an individual's success in their

186
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:54,240
goals yet critical where necessary, this is going to be exceptionally uncomfortable for

187
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,400
you, because as creators we are expected to evolve and move forward, make it personal.

188
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,660
The problem was that Amblin's channel began to feel less and less about specific struggles

189
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:07,660
and more like a soap opera where rhetoric and emotional response is valued over actual

190
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:13,200
evolution and actual working towards goals, and personal connection with that viewer in

191
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,720
light of that. And everyone knows the success of manufactured content, and with the repetition

192
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,860
and similarity, people began to doubt the honesty of Amblin's content. And as I was

193
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,800
watching, I did too. You're having this cycle of conflict that generates views, you make

194
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,300
a video talking about how it's going to change, this in theory is meant to gain the sympathy

195
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,760
of the viewer, it's a moment of respect, you're trying to combat the challenges of your weight,

196
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,920
and suddenly you do a video and oh no you've relapsed, and suddenly you've put on another

197
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,800
twenty pounds, and it happens again and again and again, it's a downward spiral. On top

198
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,840
of this, something that many people haven't spoken about is the fact that videos about

199
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,640
gaining weight do numbers, partly because there is this very seedy audience who find

200
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,420
that content attractive, you'll see them occasionally in the comments, but a lot of

201
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,880
the time I'm sure they don't want to make their presence known. The amount of weight

202
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,200
gain content on some websites is concerning. As reasonable human beings, we all have a

203
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,360
line we draw for what we deem as a septal justification for a situation occurring. Weight

204
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,960
gain can happen, it's happened to me, it'll probably happen to me again, it's difficult

205
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,480
sometimes completely monitoring your diet, if you can do that, fair play to you, but

206
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,020
sometimes people just can't. The thing is, the ambulance shower relies on her audience

207
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:30,440
having sympathy for her situation, and although we can be reasonable sometimes and listen

208
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,440
to people talk about their struggles, when someone says oh I can't stop eating, let me

209
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,200
just consume some ben and jerry's, oh woe is me, we become suspicious of that person's

210
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,120
actual drive to change their lifestyle. And yes, of course it's important to document

211
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,160
your weaknesses, but at the same time you have to know how to frame them, and the titles

212
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,920
were becoming more clickbait and it no longer felt like a weight loss channel but more

213
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,900
like a channel where the weight becomes part of the gimmick. And that's okay if you want

214
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,720
to do that, but you have to understand that all these channels are a journey, and if Anne

215
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,600
Boleyn by some miracle lost the weight that she actually claimed she would, the journey

216
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,920
would end, and she'd lose the viewers. I mean, people are there for the weight, and

217
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,860
if the weight is gone, so is the appeal. Weight loss channels are not known for their longevity,

218
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,400
some large youtubers have lost weight but that's different, they established themselves

219
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,240
before, you're gonna have a much harder time significantly establishing yourself on

220
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,840
the idea of losing weight alone, so by not losing it but yet continuously committing

221
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,900
to it, she maintains the limbo of viewer interest. The whole storyline represents a dangerous

222
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:34,600
precedent, the content seems much more self-indulgent than reflective, and here's the thing, it's

223
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,800
okay to show weakness, it's okay to be human in your videos, but at the same time you can't

224
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,160
glorify those flaws like they're fucking clickbait. And although she never explicitly

225
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,200
stated that, she had created content who was implicitly affirming a lifestyle that

226
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,280
was counterproductive to the notion of weight loss, and you can see that in her titles,

227
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,200
you can see that in her clickbait, you can see that in her presentation, her attitude

228
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,320
is changing, and it was only going to get worse for her. Which is where I introduce

229
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,280
you to the year that ruined Anne Boleyn Reid.

230
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:28,400
As said, when Anne Boleyn started up her channel, she had a handful of anecdotes that she would

231
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,280
throw around here and there, ones about her family, ones about her relationships, ones

232
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:37,080
about her childhood, and how it shaped who she is today, and at the time, they seemed

233
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,720
genuine, they didn't seem too dishonest in their presentation, she didn't appear to have

234
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,400
too much of a motivation to lie about these circumstances. However, as time went on and

235
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,780
people started becoming disinterested in these same stories she would continuously espouse,

236
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:55,840
she decided to do two things. Firstly, she made her own stories. This was done by generating

237
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,600
melodrama throughout her vlogs, but also she retold stories that seemed less likely and

238
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,920
more dishonest, and just involved downright lying to justify what might be considered

239
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:12,160
For example, she claims that she's bipolar, or was bipolar, or probably is bipolar. It

240
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,760
seems like she's not quite sure. Or what about that time that she was diagnosed with binge

241
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,240
eating disorder back in 2007?

242
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:29,720
When it comes to scrambled eggs, I'm gonna be honest, they sometimes make me feel nauseous,

243
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,640
and it's because I have an allergy to them.

244
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,640
How do you like your eggs?

245
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:40,160
This escalated to a point where she made a video addressing the multiple lies, some of

246
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,520
which were fairly harmless, others not so much.

247
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:49,080
So if you guys remember my aunt situation, this was a while ago though. This was probably,

248
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:54,560
I don't know, it was months ago. Months, to be honest. When I uploaded a video about

249
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:03,040
how my aunt doesn't talk to me anymore because I'm fat. I was vulnerable and I was upset

250
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:10,360
and I really felt like blaming my weight on everything was just like the easiest way

251
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:21,200
to go. And if she's watching this, I am so sorry and I really just, I wish I could change

252
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,120
who I am as a person. Because I really want my aunt back.

253
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:31,600
My weight, I wouldn't say I've lied to you guys per se about it, but I definitely haven't

254
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:40,960
been like very into like telling you guys my weight. I'm fluctuating a lot. Okay, so

255
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:49,960
something else I've lied about is the job I had in Florida. I told you guys that I was

256
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:59,680
a PCA worker at assisted living facility full time and I wasn't. I was a PCA worker at assisted

257
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:05,960
living facility, but I was not full time. I did not want to live off of destiny. And

258
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,240
when I was living in Florida at the beginning, I did not make enough money on YouTube. I

259
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,400
lied about that. I did not make enough money on YouTube to support us. Something else I've

260
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,280
lied about is my blood pressure. On several occasions, I have said I don't have diabetes.

261
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,920
I don't have high blood pressure. I don't have high cholesterol. I don't have this or

262
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:32,320
whatever. All of that is true, besides the blood pressure. I don't have high blood pressure,

263
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,520
but I have borderline high blood pressure.

264
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,720
The problem was that these lines were escalating further and further, and when you're a person

265
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,480
with only so much to you like Anne Blinn Reid, you're going to have a limited scope in your

266
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,360
ability to captivate the audiences. So what can you do apart from exacerbate already existent

267
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,660
drama? And this was already hurting people such as that relationship with her aunt, whether

268
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:55,760
those tears were real or not, you get the feeling that either way someone's losing out

269
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,940
on a possibly beneficial relationship if it existed. And at the end of the day, I feel

270
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,020
that Anne Blinn is probably needing that more than anyone else in this situation. And first

271
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,720
of all, I just want to say that's the sad thing about these lines. Anne Blinn thinks

272
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,020
she can put on a brave face, shed a few tears and use that to gain audience sympathy. But

273
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:17,420
all she's doing is undoing any flavor of genuineness her old content once had with the drama that

274
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:22,300
followed the year after. You not only threw any audience bond into contention, but all

275
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:26,540
those people who might have once said, wow, that's so relatable. I feel that way too.

276
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,740
And now questioning themselves because you've turned out to be rather disreputable in your

277
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,900
behavior. This is the thing. I wanted to show a more sympathetic side of Anne Blinn Reid

278
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,160
so that we can now contrast that with what she has become. In her old video, she was

279
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,240
more restrained and arguably less emotive. And that actually worked because when you're

280
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:48,000
not forcing anything, it doesn't feel like you're trying to push any emotion or deceive

281
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,120
your audience. One thing I noticed is that Anne Blinn actually became much more disingenuous

282
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,440
because her character became much more extroverted, much more expressive, and it felt like she

283
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,200
was constantly trying to sell her audience a message, an agenda, and these regularly

284
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
conflicted.

285
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,160
YouTube rewards gluttony, clickbait, and trainwrecks, and you can probably tell that this is what

286
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,640
she cares about now, given the amount of ads she puts on, it's borderline parody. And

287
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:18,240
I'll save that point for the end, because her lies escalated in the summer of 2016 in

288
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,980
a very interesting move where she decided to try and extend or revive that deep relationship

289
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:28,660
which she had done in the past by talking about her past. But she decided that she was

290
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,600
going to lay claim to the story about an abusive partner.

291
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,640
Now experiences that have happened in our lives can be very difficult to talk about,

292
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,640
mainly because of the emotional trauma that we may have experienced due to it. However,

293
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,320
if you speak about a person who may no longer be there, or may not be aware that you're

294
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:50,060
speaking about them, or may not have the platform to defend themselves, it is also very easy

295
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:54,680
for your claims to go unchallenged, and therefore much of the judgement comes down to perception.

296
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:59,020
I know that I can't necessarily prove many of the things that I've spoken about that

297
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:03,400
happened to me in my childhood, and therefore it comes down to personal credibility.

298
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,400
And in some ways this seems like a smart idea on Anne Blinn's part, because someone of

299
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,680
her calibre at this point seems immoral enough to purposely talk about these subjects without

300
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,100
fear of repercussions, because if you deny it, you're denying her traumatic experience.

301
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:21,200
How dare you? How dare you do that? You see, it seems like a safe move on her part, but

302
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,200
it wasn't.

303
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,120
Her favourite spot was my stomach. She would punch me really hard in my stomach. She punched

304
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:33,580
me around right here a lot. She would punch me on my arms, and she would continuously

305
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:37,780
do it until I agreed to make love to her, or have sex, whatever you want to consider

306
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,780
it.

307
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:43,180
No, in fact her ex-partner Casey, who was identifying as a female during the original

308
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:49,260
relationship as Cassidy, released a video documenting his experiences with Amblin, refuting

309
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,260
her claims and arguing that he was the victim of the abuse.

310
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:59,780
I've gotten hit before. I went to school with bruises up and down my arms. Bruises.

311
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:06,580
My friends asked me, what's wrong? What happened to you? Eventually they figured it out. So

312
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:17,060
every time I would come to school upset, in tears, bruised, on my arms, hands, cuts, scars,

313
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:20,600
amber again.

314
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:25,900
Much of this comes down to one word against another, so in many ways Amblin had many opportunities

315
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:30,240
to respond to his claims. Maybe she'd argue, maybe she'd bring some evidence forward,

316
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,780
but no, she just removed her original video and kept quiet.

317
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:38,000
However there is a re-upload which can quite clearly show how manipulative she is if our

318
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,820
judgement of these events is correct. She hooks the audience in with that anecdote of

319
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:46,540
her parents, and how intimate this was to her, and then leads into this elaborate story

320
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,040
about her experience.

321
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,700
The one thing that she did do was this very strange poetry reading, which I suppose was

322
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,780
meant to be some kind of cryptic response, but that's the best she can do. She's

323
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:00,140
trying to be in a position of vagueness so that the person can't respond.

324
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:06,220
Rain and petals eavesdrop, I used the wrong word. Rain and petals eavesdrop, I used the

325
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:11,700
wrong word. Rain and petals eavesdrop, I used the wrong word. My mental hygiene has been

326
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,220
rotten and stirred.

327
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,800
Not quite Tennyson, is it? And that's another thing I wanted to note. Amblin seems to use

328
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,140
these tropes like poetry and literature that are typically seen as channeling one's feelings

329
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:27,860
into a higher emotive plane to circumvent criticism and try and add depth to her character.

330
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:32,300
Using art to convey false feelings is extremely manipulative because we typically look to

331
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:36,940
the implicit messages of art to indirectly convey the character of a person that they

332
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:42,060
may not express directly. It's like an outlet, so that we may look back and one day say,

333
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:46,900
oh what a troubled mind. But Amblin takes advantage of that and she tries to convey

334
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:51,620
sentiments that aren't really true, and now she's trying to portray experiences that

335
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:55,020
aren't really true. Fortunately, people saw through it.

336
00:28:55,020 --> 00:29:00,220
And this is the thing, if this was true, this is the most vulnerable and open you can get,

337
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:04,580
and let me explain why that's important. If I am late to some appointments, some people

338
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,780
might not trust me when I commit to arriving at a certain time, but they might still trust

339
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:12,580
me if I decide to talk about more personal matters because they will assume that you

340
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:17,100
have a degree of respect for the sensitivity of those subjects and will not take advantage

341
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:22,340
of them for personal gain. This is exactly what Amblin has done, and thus she has sacrificed

342
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:26,740
all of her credibility. You cannot trust her when she tries to open up about more personal

343
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:31,560
content in the future, and it brings into question everything she's ever spoken about.

344
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,260
What if this content that once bonded people was just a fraud all along? I don't know

345
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:41,020
if it was all a fraud because I don't know if she had the same goal at the start of her

346
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,960
channel, but I'm sure that's what it's descended to now, and it's genuinely sad

347
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,100
that the few people that she may have given hope to at one point have probably seen that

348
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:54,280
desolated by a fame-driven appeal to a populace who are watching a train wreck.

349
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:59,240
2016 was also the year that introduced her to Mukbang. By now she'd already started

350
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,140
doing food reviews, which clearly wasn't a good decision, but Mukbang was really the

351
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:07,180
straw that broke the camel's back, and I think that's what annoyed a lot of people.

352
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,840
The simple fact is that no one who is actively trying to lose weight can simultaneously create

353
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,360
a fantastic brand of eating large amounts of food in one sitting, unless it's sesame

354
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,200
seeds. The only way you could do that is if you were exercising an equal amount of time

355
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,460
to burn off the calories, which Amblin was clearly not doing, but it gave her some of

356
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:27,960
the best views in her career, so who cared, and it made her put on weight, and then she

357
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,240
could bring attention to her weight which also generated views, and you create this

358
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:36,240
cycle that runs again, and again, and again. But this channel shouldn't be about views,

359
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,620
it's about Amblin, and there are so many problems to observe here.

360
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:50,720
I can't speak for everyone here, but I've often found my behaviour a somewhat conscious

361
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,360
response to the environment around me. When I have found myself in situations where my

362
00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:00,320
reputation might be viewed badly by those in my circle, I have an option to work hard

363
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,820
to realign that view of me, or I could fall into fulfilling what they view of me and not

364
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:08,860
bother what they think. I've often worked hard to take the former option because firstly

365
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:12,820
because I'm a paranoid person who does enjoy being on good terms with those around me,

366
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:17,060
and secondly because I think it's a better thing to do, it's a more positive impact.

367
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:21,380
Being self-conscious isn't a blessing in some ways, it causes a lot of stress in social

368
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:26,660
situations, but at the same time being self-aware is important, because you not just look after

369
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:31,180
yourself, but you look after the message that you might be portraying to your audience.

370
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:38,340
I feel that in this situation, Amblin has eventually found herself in so much drama

371
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:42,940
and found it so profitable that she has completely disregarded on her. That has made her more

372
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:48,020
audacious, outgoing, and perhaps even confident, but it also makes her more fake, more toxic,

373
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:52,380
and more destructive. When she half-heartedly tries to create a bond with any viewers that

374
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:56,260
might actually be there for her personality, which I'm highly doubtful of, she's found

375
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:00,700
it much easier to fall into the worst perception that people have of her rather than actively

376
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:05,460
challenging it. As her personality has changed, so has her lifestyle, and she put on more

377
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:10,020
and more weight, while supposedly lamenting it. In my opinion, although they don't receive

378
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,820
much airtime in developing their character, she has surrounded herself with people who

379
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:17,180
don't challenge that mentality and may actually affirm it.

380
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,340
Studies show that you're much more likely to conform to those around you in person than

381
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:40,740
if they're impersonal, like over the web, or over the phone. In the original video,

382
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:44,220
she's clearly much more conscious about what people think, but now she's clearly

383
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:48,500
comfortable in her real-life situation, and that's all she sees herself as having to

384
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,880
answer to now. There's a load of pointing fingers about who's caused who to gain weight

385
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,420
and so on, and I don't know who is doing what specifically, I don't know what goes

386
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:02,460
on behind the scenes exactly other than it involves food. What I do know is that it's

387
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:06,860
happening, and regardless of the excuses that Amblin tries to spew, she has put on a significant

388
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:11,300
amount of weight, weight that when we look at her old content, she didn't put on, and

389
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:15,060
she didn't put it on for a while. This was content that regardless of whether you believe

390
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:19,760
it was legitimate or not, showed that Amblin doesn't have the world's slowest metabolism

391
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,640
and can't do anything at all to prevent her weight gain. In the last couple years,

392
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,340
the amount of hate she's been receiving has steadily increased, probably due to people

393
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:32,720
calling out that cycle. And yet, I think by going through that cycle, she has just found

394
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,660
herself falling further and further into it, and she has responded to this by doing these

395
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:41,380
reading hate comments. This successfully alienates herself from the audience and the genuine

396
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:46,160
criticism that she might be receiving. Whether people's tone is right or not does not discount

397
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,480
the genuine problems here. She attributes the criticism to the fact that she is fat.

398
00:33:50,480 --> 00:34:06,560
And not the fact that she has continuously failed to sort herself out, despite the fact

399
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,800
that she's acknowledged this many times before so much that people don't believe that she

400
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:32,760
is taking her own criticism seriously.

401
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,840
There are so many videos documenting these constant contradictions, that one can be found

402
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:41,240
on the Binge Monsters channel, I'll leave it in the pinned comment. And I think how

403
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:45,960
the thought of just firstly her lack of care in these actions, and then the thought that

404
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,640
she recorded, edited and uploaded it, with the thought that this is a good message to

405
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:55,980
be sending, it doesn't feel real. It feels like she's taking advantage, and then the

406
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:00,680
next day she'll express regret, which will just seem as insincere. Her attitude just

407
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:05,760
screams to me, someone who doesn't care anymore. Whatever there was in the past just isn't

408
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,040
there, and I think that's the most dishonest factor that comes into this, is the fact that

409
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,960
she still wants to care, and now all she does is cater to people who want to watch the disaster

410
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:21,520
unfold and count up those pounds, 400 pounds, 500 pounds, approaching 600 pounds, which

411
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,040
would be around 270 kilograms.

412
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,600
I think Anne Boleyn came onto YouTube for the weight loss, I mean in her old video she

413
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,880
said she wanted to do this because she wanted an audience to hold her accountable, but the

414
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,880
problem is that when that audience decided to hold it into account, regardless of whether

415
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,760
they may have been hostile or not, she clearly didn't handle it well, and YouTube became

416
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:47,680
about a different goal, she realised that she could foster that hostility, and garner

417
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:53,040
more views. She shifted the responsibility of her diet onto the audience response, and

418
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,840
since has continued to gain weight, at a rate that has not been noted before on her channel,

419
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:03,120
continuously committing to change but failing, and now whenever she has those solemn speeches

420
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,200
where she promises to do better, it feels like a political ruse rather than actually

421
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,940
any genuine commitment, even if in the early days her commitments were futile, it felt

422
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:16,560
like she believed them at the time. Does she really believe them now? I hope she does,

423
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,600
but if she does change, it will not be with the mindset that she currently has, which

424
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:25,160
is a self-destructive one, if she really does care about getting her weight down, then she

425
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:29,520
has to change, if she doesn't want to lose weight, well there's nothing I can say to

426
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,760
her. With regards to that on principle, it's not what I'd recommend, and you're putting

427
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,000
an awful lot of stress onto an already struggling healthcare system, but at the same time, you

428
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
need to stop promoting this arc, this cycle, to possibly vulnerable people that your mentality

429
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,580
is justifiable to someone who might want to lose weight, even though you apparently want

430
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:52,540
to lose weight. To a majority of the audience, it might seem obvious that this is not the

431
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,480
way that someone should live, but there will always be people who are questioning their

432
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,480
own responsibility, and although it's definitely possible that some people are weaker than

433
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,040
others, because your situation is not like any other Amberlynn, you have an audience

434
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:10,360
that is now watching a person, and counting up their weight until something terrible happens,

435
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:14,440
and you're placing 8 mid-roll ads, and you're probably making a decent amount of money from

436
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,880
that, other people don't have that, so don't try and frame your mentality from a moral

437
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,980
standpoint because most other people who might be in a similar weight position don't have

438
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:27,540
all these motivations that have become so obvious in your recent content, they do not

439
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:32,680
have that safety net. I mean, come on, look at those mid-rolls. And the list of stuff

440
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:37,020
she does goes on and on and on, and it's not worth documenting them all right now because

441
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:41,740
at the end of the day, they can be explained by the mentality we've discussed. More lying,

442
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:46,320
animal maltreatment, some kind of pyramid scheme. She apparently created a fake account

443
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,460
to defend herself from criticism in a Facebook and apparently Discord group too. It's genuinely

444
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:55,260
frustrating because whether she was genuine in her first videos or not, it's clear they

445
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:00,780
meant something to people, and now it's just come to here, and I wish it hadn't. Do you

446
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,580
know how many puns I can make now? But you see, I'm a man of refrain, because I accept

447
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:09,340
that life is not easy, and when we deal with serious problems in our lives, we might let

448
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:13,500
go of some of the things that we are meant to take care of, but at the same time, it's

449
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:18,220
important that we acknowledge the consequences our actions might have, and I think that's

450
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:22,460
what bothers people. You're a public figure. There is this mentality that people are gonna

451
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:26,820
hate on you just because you're fat, and sure, a few people are like that, but at the

452
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:31,600
same time, being overweight does promote an insecurity in many people, and I think you

453
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:36,500
understand that insecurity too. Your old videos definitely seem that way. Other YouTube related

454
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,780
factors that you might be experiencing may override that now, but that's not the case

455
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:45,180
for anyone else that you're sending these messages to. You are the exception, not the

456
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:50,140
rule. In our first ever video, Anne Boleyn says she's doing this for herself.

457
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,820
I'm not really doing this for other people, I'm more so doing it for myself.

458
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:58,320
It's clear what that means to her now. This is the problem. Anne Boleyn cannot stop the

459
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,580
cycle of failure, and food, and consumption, or else she will lose her subscribers regardless

460
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:07,860
of their motivation to stay, and she'll continue to push herself further and further until

461
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:11,420
something terrible happens, and she loses that audience that she gained in the first

462
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:15,460
place, and all she'll be left with is a lot of weight, and the security is gone, and

463
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:20,080
all that drama, all that deception that you took part in that hurt people, the clearly

464
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:24,420
affected people, would be for nothing. You're on thin ice as it is. People don't stick

465
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:28,260
around for the credibility because they know you have none of that. You've destroyed

466
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,220
that for the sake of clickbait and views, and talking about people who you thought couldn't

467
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:36,820
defend themselves. Many people will just see how far you can push yourself, and I sure

468
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,940
as hell hope you turn us around, for everyone's sake, because I don't see many positive

469
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:45,580
outcomes from this situation as it is. To the audience, having idols for weight loss

470
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:50,540
is important, it's sometimes hard, and I really do deeply empathise with that struggle,

471
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:54,900
but Anne Boleyn Reid is not an idol, and the fact that she might be quote trying is not

472
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,900
really a defence against the very serious criticism she is facing down, because it's

473
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:03,940
clear there is a level of consciousness to what she's doing. I just want people to get

474
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,220
better.

475
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:10,820
So yeah, there's the video. Passionate, passionate, passionate, I hope the passion came across.

476
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:16,260
I would love to give a big shoutout to the editors, they have done a fantastic job, stellar

477
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:20,780
stellar job my friends. Make sure you follow them, check out their videos, some of them

478
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:24,480
are very tanned to people who are definitely going places, and one day they'll look back

479
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:30,540
and they'll say I edited for that idiot once. Also, big shoutout to my Patreons, they're

480
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:38,500
up on the screen now, and special shoutout to my $50 Patreons, Connor, great chap, and

481
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:43,680
some hullabaloo, whose name should be correctly spelt this time, I apologise sincerely for

482
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,540
my terrible error first time round. Also, one more $50 Patreon evening steal, who has

483
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:54,500
only recently signed up, thank you very much, all you $50 Patreons are beautiful people,

484
00:40:54,500 --> 00:41:02,220
much love. And also to my $100 Patreons, Ryan and Brandon, who have blessed me with their

485
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:26,420
generosity.

486
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:45,940
Thank you.
