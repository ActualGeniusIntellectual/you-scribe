00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,960
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,380
too much free time, and today we discuss a daddy that isn't Keemstar, what a shock.

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,920
No today we shall be talking about the infamous Daddy05, to those who are unaware of this

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,320
gent he is a family vlogger slash prankster, I use those terms very liberally, who found

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,140
himself on the rocks a few years back, he was both shaken and stirred. Why? Well if

6
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,540
you don't know you'll soon find out. Because my friends we are going back to a blast from

7
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,620
the past, but we shall begin with a little anecdote as always, because I have actually

8
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,060
made a video on Daddy05, although no one has ever seen it. You see as an artist, if that's

9
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,160
what you can call my work at least, I have started, scripted and worked on many videos

10
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,280
that will probably never see the light of day. That is the case for pretty much anyone

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,060
in the creative industry, it's about running with a lot of ideas, some of which do not

12
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,380
work, sometimes we realise these ideas don't work three lines into scripting them, sometimes

13
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,500
we realise they don't work three years after you uploaded them, that is the life of the

14
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,460
miserable creator. However the Daddy05 video was a classic case of changing circumstances,

15
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:15,700
I had a video, uploaded it to YouTube, was ready to drop some very stinging criticism,

16
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,580
had a big saucy thumbnail, and suddenly this video dropped.

17
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:43,380
And I felt these circumstances had changed. The thing about Daddy05 is that it was a situation

18
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,380
that greatly put his children in the spotlight, and regardless of whether they were sincere

19
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,380
about this apology or not, I was not going to continue to drag them to something which

20
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,740
they had shown a motivation to change philosophy in, there were children involved, and the

21
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,980
apology video changed the context to the point where I no longer felt confident in my upload.

22
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,700
Now that the dust is settled, hopefully firstly I can quell my allergic reaction, and secondly

23
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,140
I can look into the situation and the legacy with fresh eyes. What was he apologising for?

24
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,700
I'll explain the details very soon, but he was facing down a number of serious allegations

25
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,180
and evidence that the creation of his content was being elicited through the abuse of his

26
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,380
children, something not to be taken lightly at all.

27
00:02:41,140 --> 00:03:00,180
He

28
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,420
was terminated by the YouTube gods for his transgressions, and likely because the media

29
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,700
were picking up on it, and YouTube's relationship with the media is quite rocky, and no compromises

30
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:15,140
can be taken when it comes to their reputation, to say the least, and we as human beings continued

31
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,020
with our daily lives. So why bring it back now? Well for a few reasons, first one being

32
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,820
some cheeky twats over on Twitter tagged me in a thread asking me to cover it, now I want

33
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:29,460
to make this clear, I do not often take requests, but if there's enough meat on the bone I'll

34
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,540
throw myself into the ring. The only reason I'm saying this is the last time I credited

35
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,500
someone's request, I was bombarded with requests of the newest naughty YouTuber, and I only

36
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,300
have so much time on this planet, I'm really sorry guys, I'm not saying don't send me

37
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,620
spicy news on people, I'm just saying don't get your hopes up. So I was mulling on this

38
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,420
for a while, and then I saw my Good Acquaintance Priminx video, which reignited my passion

39
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,180
for the whole debacle, because although the barebones information was something that I

40
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,580
was aware of, seeing someone expressing their opinion on it interested me further, and then

41
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,980
the fact that Daddy05 threw a tantrum in response made me think that maybe there is a bit more

42
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,060
to this story than we give it credit for, because the story in the headlines is that

43
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:15,140
Daddy05 is back, back in what way? Has he had his channel restored? Well, not really,

44
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:20,500
but you see Daddy05 never technically left, they were on YouTube until a few months back,

45
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,980
when YouTube clearly probably decided that they'd had enough of that platform as well,

46
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,460
and chucked them off, in which there was a very emotional video uploaded onto another channel,

47
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,420
alas their tears fell upon the frosty heart of the viewer, but a few months later they

48
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:39,620
are once again back, as Primink documents, but not exactly, you see their children now

49
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,260
have a channel in which they create their own content that is owned by the grandparents,

50
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,780
so Daddy05 claims to be not associated at all, the channel is known as the Martin Boys,

51
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,180
which is comprised of the three remaining siblings, after the biological mother of Cody

52
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,580
and Emma regained custody. There aren't too many indications of where this channel is going,

53
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,820
or what exactly it's going to be about, but one can assume it won't be too sinister,

54
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,580
given how I'm sure the Martin family are aware they're on thin ice.

55
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,420
Nonetheless, it seems there are some questions about the ethics of this whole debacle,

56
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:15,860
with Daddy05 positioning himself as a staunch defender of the lads rights to do what they want,

57
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,420
while also decrying any association with it. This has opened a whole new debate

58
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,580
about the morality of it, and frankly I find it all a bit messy.

59
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:32,500
Everyone's saying, oh Daddy05 is back, Family05 is back, no, no I'm not, I don't own a YouTube

60
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:38,820
channel, I have nothing to do with the Martin Boys YouTube channel, I do not own that channel,

61
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,860
my name is not on that channel anywhere, nothing on that channel links back to me

62
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:51,300
in any way shape or form, the Boys grandparents own that channel, they run that channel, and I

63
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:58,500
have nothing to do with it, stop giving me shit about a channel that I don't have nothing to do

64
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,380
with, I don't have access to it, I don't have anything to do with it, stop giving the Boys shit

65
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:11,940
about their YouTube channel, I have nothing to do with it, it's not even mine, you're being stupid,

66
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:26,660
I found that revisiting the whole topic has showed it to be incredibly appealing,

67
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:31,620
and my plan will be to open a discussion on a multitude of Martin's actions and behaviours,

68
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,740
particularly on how they rose to infamy, and how this rise can indicate a very simple longevity

69
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,300
that will be detestable to most people, but irresistible to a select few that will keep

70
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,340
their channel alive, equally I do not want this to be some simple analysis, because I do have a

71
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:51,540
lot to say that I held off on the day, and a lot of these sentiments still ring true now, so expect

72
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,740
a mix and match, today we're going to be discussing a lot, but you see to touch all bases you have to

73
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,740
hit a home run, and that's what I plan to do, because out of all the topics that I've covered,

74
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,620
I say this one has some of the most psychological discussions there are, so without further ado I

75
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,500
suggest we dive into DaddyOFive and explain the numerous phenomena that drive such a situation

76
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:16,100
that still has implications to this day, I cannot wait, and neither should you, let's get to it.

77
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:28,020
Now, DaddyOFive's channel was set up in 2015, however as noted it has been terminated,

78
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:33,940
so we rely on the remnants that history leaves us with to be able to make judgement of such content,

79
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,580
nonetheless we don't necessarily need specific details of DaddyOFive's channel to understand

80
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,940
everything that probably caused his channel to thrive, because 2015 was the year of the prank,

81
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,180
now I'm not going to make up any bullshit and say that pranks were only big in 2015,

82
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,220
they still exist to this day, many creators are still incredibly successful off the back of them,

83
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,780
and there is no doubt in my mind that it will continue to thrive for years to come at least,

84
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:03,860
however 2015 was the year that we had multiple controversies surrounding pranks, prank invasion,

85
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:09,300
Sam Pepper, and so on, it was a huge year for the pranksters, and this is where we discuss the

86
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,020
rise of the prank in the first place, the rise of the prank is a rather unsettling one, because

87
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:18,660
there will always be an audience for these pranks, needless to say I am not a fan of them at all,

88
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,940
but people love to see others in natural environments be fooled, while the audience

89
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:29,300
are completely aware of it, it's that dynamic, equally the notion of a prank can often make

90
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:35,060
creators conduct more extreme actions and excuse it under the notion of a prank, such as the

91
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:40,740
multiple social experiments, of course as a defence this is valid to an extent, but it's also

92
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,380
what creates the unique environment for pranks to thrive in, because you can't just stand around

93
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:50,180
expecting those situations to happen naturally, a social experiment is, although certainly not

94
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,500
conducted within the means of scientific reliability, an appropriate name for what many

95
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,660
of these YouTubers do, they manipulate an environment and then expose the reaction of

96
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,380
those in it, that is the trend that DaddyOFive appeared to jump on most enthusiastically,

97
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,780
the prank, now the prank typically involves deceiving the participant, and many immediately

98
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:13,300
would raise ethical claims, however sometimes deception is necessary to understand how humans

99
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:18,180
act in certain situations, for example the Milgram experiment, I'm not going to go into

100
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:23,140
details about it because it's fairly irrelevant, but it's a sobering study on the human condition,

101
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:28,100
and a perfect example of how sometimes we need to deceive participants to get to the truth,

102
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,820
and I'd recommend checking it out if you haven't, it wouldn't have been obtained otherwise.

103
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,740
However, with the notion of a prank, the deception is what makes it entertaining,

104
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,980
which once again in many situations is fine, particularly when considering that a majority

105
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,540
of pranks slash social experiments were fake, and although we can definitely be annoyed at the

106
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,460
people for faking them and misleading their audience, I'm glad that some of the direct

107
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:53,620
shock that many of the subjects of their videos appear to endure wasn't actually real,

108
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,620
because those situations, particularly ones where you have a bloody bomb thrown at your feet,

109
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:03,140
can be pretty intense and raises significant ethical questions. DaddyOFive appeared to start

110
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:08,100
off his channel in a fairly less extreme prank direction, with content that was stupid and

111
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,060
idiotic but still that you could see might pass under YouTube's radar, however probably seeing

112
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:19,220
the success in violence and seeing the audience response made them more motivated to become more

113
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:24,580
hands-on. But why on earth would more people want to see something which is, without debate,

114
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,620
much more aggressive and unpleasant? The thing is, revisiting DaddyOFive made

115
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,260
me realise that there is a significant audience that never really cared about ethics, what a

116
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,020
surprise. They didn't care about people's wellbeing, they're the sort of people who

117
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,180
see a crime and pull out their iPhones and say they were just recording for evidence.

118
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,740
The simple truth is, and there is no two ways about it, what made DaddyOFive so successful

119
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,340
was that it doesn't matter whether they were branded as pranks or a joke,

120
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:55,460
DaddyOFive provided the closest glimpse into the human reaction of a quote prank,

121
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,620
because it is an up-close first-person perspective of something that you feel.

122
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,180
And let me tell you, those emotions are very real, I was rewatching some of his Xbox pranks

123
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:09,540
on a reupload channel, and I had to stop because I was crying, I was angry, I was enraged at how

124
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,420
he treated Cody, and yet with a bit of emotional distance, that's what some people wanted,

125
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:19,060
because that demographic existed. The realism is furthered once you acknowledge the fact that

126
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:23,780
these people are children, and children are more likely to be emotionally volatile and react in

127
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:28,260
such a way. People like chaos, people like volatility, everyone likes a prank where

128
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,420
someone gets really angry, but whereas many pranksters were just plain actors,

129
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:37,860
Mike Martin's channel had exhibits of the most raw aggression possible, and people ate it up.

130
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,580
No one else did that, and no one else should do it, and most people couldn't do it. The emotional

131
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:47,620
intimacy of having a situation like that would be impossible, how can you expose yourself to that

132
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,940
level of suffering of your own children? But that's the thing, they weren't his own children,

133
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,540
and this matters more than you think.

134
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,460
Did you see this game when I sliced open his guts? I never felt so alive!

135
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,620
Yeah, well you've been alive for like two minutes.

136
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:10,580
While they do mess with the kids, a lot of the time it seems directed towards one specific kid,

137
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,620
and that is Cody. While in the family video where they defended themselves, they said, you know,

138
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,860
the kids get to decide if the video goes up, they also acknowledge that they have so much cool stuff

139
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,620
thanks to having a YouTube channel. So by getting stuff, they're incentivized to allow the parents

140
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,100
to upload these videos, even though the little kid Cody is very obviously not a fan of them.

141
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,700
The youngest and the weakest and the most sensitive kid, Cody,

142
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,700
is always nursing an injury, he's always covered in bruises. From video to video,

143
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,740
there are signs of abuse all over his arms, his legs, his face.

144
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,540
Generally there's a psychological phenomenon known as the Cinderella effect. Now I don't want to give

145
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,940
too much credit to this theory, as I do not find the research on it to be the most reliable under

146
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,740
closer scrutiny, but basically what it dictates is that step-parents are more likely to be abusive

147
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,460
to their children than their biological parents. Now although I believe the impacts are overstated

148
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:59,540
in certain circumstances, I do think there's a serious case to be made here of why certain

149
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,780
children were such targets. This is an evolutionary theory, and Mike and Heather

150
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:08,180
seem rather primitive to say the least. There seems to be this emotional distance. In the

151
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,140
Drama Alert interview, Heather has this very unsettling way of referring to Cody as quote

152
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:22,900
the boy. Interesting as she is the step-parent, once again, given the whole seedy nature of how

153
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:27,940
they gain custody over him, it genuinely would not surprise me if that emotional distance from

154
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,500
the adoption and subsequent alienation led to them being the greater targets of the abuse.

155
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,140
On top of this, what would then happen is you'd see these very weird ways of justifying the abuse,

156
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:41,380
which was probably both a technique for them and for their audience that somehow it wasn't

157
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:46,420
their fault. After all, in many households, punitive measures are seen as fairly straightforward,

158
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,060
even though this was clearly extreme, if you have someone who is punitively inclined, they see

159
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:55,780
Heather and Mike talking these children down, it will fall into their sphere of perceptibility.

160
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,620
I'll probably talk about this more in a future video than I have planned, but this is basically

161
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:04,740
the psychological techniques that led to these children being treated differently in my opinion,

162
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,540
and it seemed to yield from the fact that they didn't have that same connection, and the parents

163
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,100
actively tried to neglect it, particularly in the mother's instance. When people made exposed

164
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,500
videos on DaddyOFive, they rightfully highlighted the worst of his channel, but the thing is by

165
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,980
ignoring the best of his channel, it gave them a get-out-of-jail-free card, the oh well you don't

166
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,860
see the good side of DaddyOFive, there's a channel with a whole video dedicated to it, where they

167
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:55,140
just play the emotional music, over the riveting clips, but really this was just another

168
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:00,660
manipulation tactic to somehow once again create a moral delusion to justify the abuse, to try and

169
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:06,100
make people think, oh I guess he was alright after it all. Happy times do not negate abusive

170
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,740
or violent ones, that's like saying if Joe Blow punches his wife in the face, calls or slurs,

171
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,540
but that's only like 5-10% of the time, the other 90% of the time it's just good, he's sweet,

172
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:20,660
he cares, he apologizes, no the good times do not negate the abuse, that is a very important thing

173
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:26,100
to know. The truth is you can't orchestrate the child's emotions in many of the videos,

174
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,140
and then say, oh well he's happy in certain moments that somehow justifies it, I had many

175
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,300
happy moments in my childhood, it doesn't change the terrible things that happened to me and the

176
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,220
lasting effects they have to this day, and if the people who did those things were to come to my

177
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,860
house with a box of chocolates and an apology, I'd appreciate it, but it wouldn't justify their

178
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,980
actions. There is no prank, but people didn't care, and Mike clearly didn't care, he was

179
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:54,500
extracting money out of that kid like an ATM, and exploiting that emotional distance so he felt no

180
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,300
repercussions for his actions, and people watched it, after all, they're not responsible are they,

181
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,940
they're just a single view, watching cruel and crazy videos on the internet, isn't that what

182
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,500
people do? The thing is this isn't some third party testimony where you get to watch it on the

183
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,460
news, some found footage, this was literally a person making money out of direct abuse and

184
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:19,220
people let him reach 700,000 before others had to intervene. This is a situation like no other,

185
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,300
and the fact that many people didn't have to experience the consequences directly of their

186
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,460
actions meant they didn't feel responsible for whatever happened. On the other hand,

187
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:32,660
you probably had a smaller but more dedicated fanbase of actual sadists who used the first

188
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:37,460
person perspective that Mike often provided to live out violent fantasies that they themselves

189
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,580
were not prepared to commit.

190
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,140
uh all the kids need to gang up on jake at once

191
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:19,140
tie him down and torture him king broton you're right why the hell is cody such a damn liar thief

192
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:26,020
and evil nobody deserves his crap you did the right thing daddy five but this monster deserves

193
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:26,580
this

194
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:42,740
the internet is screwed everyone knows this and youtube is a target as much as anywhere else for

195
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,460
these people to congregate and create their cruel little circles where they pose whatever fulfills

196
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,260
their twisted desires i can't stop people from being inherently fucked up because some people

197
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,660
always will be but what you can do is put the well-being of others first and know that if you

198
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:01,940
were to enact your desires a lot of people would suffer and maybe reconsider your position on

199
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:07,380
supporting such content essentially daddy o5's rise to the near top of the youtube totem pole

200
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,860
was done through distorting a reality that made fans feel secure in their support of him whether

201
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,500
it was through the emotional distance or through the tonal shifts that created an illusion and yet

202
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,460
showed reality so raw that many people felt compelled to watch it's morally reprehensible

203
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:26,820
but no one wanted to take responsibility equally by taking the ever popular notion of a prank

204
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:32,100
and upping the realism to 11 he created something that without moral boundaries appeal to people

205
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:37,140
which they then justified in their own heads with daddy o5 doing something no one else would really

206
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:42,260
do and for good reason too the videos that mike made were absolutely appalling and there is no

207
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:46,900
doubt in my mind that they had to be removed but by letting them fester for so long martin had

208
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:51,860
created a fan base some of these fans left after mike was exposed whether it was for the moral

209
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:56,980
epiphany or just the fact that he'd no longer be uploading his brilliant content is probably down

210
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:01,780
to the individual but either way that was when the exodus occurred but as always there were

211
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:06,900
many stragglers who stuck around for various reasons and daddy o5 pulled out all the stock

212
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:24,020
to keep them on his side youtube had no option it doesn't matter if it was all taken out of context

213
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:29,060
which it wasn't there was no way that they could let that sort of reputation gather on a site that

214
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:33,940
was facing down tough times anymore i am for a free and open youtube but equally there was a

215
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:39,060
line and the only use those videos should have been for was custody evidence you see the issue

216
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:44,900
with daddy o5 is that he epitomizes the classic action consequence dynamic that helps drive many

217
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:49,780
of the exiled individuals from the internet this is always the situation with the platforming and

218
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:54,020
why it has been handled very sensitively when someone conducts themselves in a way in which

219
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,820
some people may feel affects them they may act on what they decide to be justice the problem is the

220
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,460
perception of justice is completely subject to the individual and when you take action against

221
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,860
someone you'll always give them some sort of power to use that narrative and make themselves

222
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,180
a victim does this mean you shouldn't take retributive action of course not you just have

223
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:17,060
to work out how to make sure people can understand that in the context of the situation your listed

224
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:22,100
justice was righteous and businesses often don't feel the need to do that after all people aren't

225
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,580
entitled to an explanation and one thing that we've found is that every time youtube opens its

226
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:32,340
mouth someone tends to get hurt equally however it does mean that those who you will remove have

227
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:37,460
all the platform to scream and holler about it and so on daddy o5 provided content that no one

228
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:42,660
else could which is why people firstly watched him and secondly tried to twist the content into

229
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,700
a morally justifiable mold which meant that when daddy o5 decided that he was ready to play victim

230
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:52,980
there was an army of fans ready to come to his aid so first came the original response video now

231
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:58,660
people hated this video many people did rightfully so but equally it created a sect of intense daddy

232
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:03,860
o5 loyalists through the narratives crafted titled false acquisitions another stunning

233
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:08,180
display of martin's intellect he decides to respond to some of these claims but equally

234
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:14,260
tries to keep the fans on board we're gonna make things right we're gonna make things right and i

235
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:21,060
want everyone to feel comfortable and know that these kids are safe that this is all an act

236
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:25,940
firstly it set up the precipice that his videos were fake normally this would be a compromise on

237
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:30,660
the appeal of your channel's content but martin knew that he was on borrowed time as it was and

238
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:34,980
couldn't continue his current brand anyway therefore in this instance claiming your videos

239
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:40,820
are fake immediately plays into that narrative the reason why i say claiming rather than admitting is

240
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:45,540
that it's such a tactical decision that i highly doubt they were fake and even if they were children

241
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:50,180
like cody have no way to discern that and it's clear it caused a lot of genuine trauma therefore

242
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:55,380
their defiance just really exposed how deceptive they were willing to be to maintain some semblance

243
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:00,260
of audience stating that these videos were fake played credence into some people's minds and

244
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:06,900
makes them feel better about supporting this madman uh cody is going to grow up to be an actor

245
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:12,580
um i'm pretty sure of that which page in the script involved a stepbrother punching cody in

246
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,500
the head he was being pinned on the ground and he got kicked in the crotch was that just kind of an

247
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:22,180
ad lib thing are they method actors then they claim they put disclaimer that it was all just

248
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:28,260
for entertainment purposes which just makes it all right i put in the video description for

249
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:35,060
entertainment purposes early i categorize the videos as entertainment or comedy something that

250
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:41,780
i know i've even used keywords a few times i use the word fake in the keywords and stuff a few times

251
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,940
this is embarrassing but still it was a confirmation bias to people who wanted to

252
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:50,820
hear that then they do the classic greg paul technique of reaffirming loyalty by branding

253
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:57,060
them as real fans and praising the ones who stick with them after this i i we just wanted to make

254
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:03,060
videos for you guys and we truly appreciate the love and support that you guys our real fans have

255
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:09,380
given us over the last few days with everything that's going on and we're really sorry that we

256
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:15,860
have to disappoint you and say that this immediately detaches them from the horrible

257
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:21,300
mainstream moral normies and creates a reaffirmation of bond and pulls the dedicated

258
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:26,820
viewer in it creates a moral burden remaining with these people and they look tired and forlorn

259
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,700
they're the victims here guys can't you see all these false acquisitions have been weighing down

260
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:36,740
with them brings a tear to my eye another really important narrative you'll see is him talking

261
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:43,220
about the news once again the mainstream media is an easy target i mean i sure as hell don't like

262
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:48,100
them a bunch of sensationalist cowards but it doesn't mean they're wrong all the time however

263
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,420
the general distaste of the media allowed mike to move in and take advantage of it attacking the

264
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:56,660
news and lumping any of his critics in with it as well it's also a power play attacking the

265
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,300
mainstream media 99 percent of the time is going to come across as punching up and punching up

266
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:05,220
makes you look more justified in your position because of some perceived institutional power

267
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,540
they hold while name-dropping philip defranco for merely reporting it and setting his delightful

268
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:14,420
fans on him it's clear that they didn't really know how to respond this is a peak victim narrative

269
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:18,660
and once again it plays off that collateral dynamic that it's philip's fault for documenting

270
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:23,140
this abuse rather than their fault for the abuse now they claim that the abuse is taken out of

271
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,540
context they claim that the threats they've been receiving somehow makes defranco responsible as

272
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:34,500
well it would have never got this out of hand if it wasn't for that defranco guy starting all of

273
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:41,540
this doing all of this to my family he's responsible for this their voices are emotional they've been

274
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:46,980
attacked someone get me a tissue i'm gonna gonna cry listen because defranco is a huge creator he

275
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,460
has that clout to lead to such instance because you made provocative videos when working out how

276
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,540
someone has contributed to your hatred you have to look at their presentation sometimes i've

277
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:00,020
criticized people for making individuals out to be worse than they actually are however defranco

278
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:04,740
just delivers a message on a situation that has been transpiring anyway the only difference was

279
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,540
his size and many people were left to make their own judgment which they did when you behave in a

280
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:14,100
way that instigates hatred upon yourself you have to be prepared to take it unless it comes from an

281
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,740
exaggerated or false narrative defranco wasn't even the initial incident that caused this it

282
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:23,780
was your ink prank he was merely publicizing it which he had every right to there was a range of

283
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:28,260
anger some people saying this is outright abuse of your children others saying this is not abuse

284
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,700
but these are asshole parents that are exploiting their children for money and hurting them

285
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,540
emotionally and then it also appears that they have a dedicated audience that are completely

286
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:41,780
fine with it crimey river bitches anyhow there's a lot of back and forth and anger and eventually

287
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:46,580
the backlash from this video was felt people were angry and riled up and the walls were closing in

288
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:58,900
on them

289
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:11,220
oh

290
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:18,980
this is where it becomes interesting because the family then puts out a more regretful video

291
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:23,620
with the mum talking because although i'd say she's just as manipulative she's a bit more

292
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:28,260
subtle chances are this was probably motivated by the threat of losing custody to cody which

293
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:32,980
they subsequently did and there was a whole story behind this that had martin and his wife deceiving

294
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:37,460
the authorities into having custody over the children mike martin daddy of five left back

295
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:42,180
in 2008 when cody was one and emma was almost three my sister took care of those kids by herself

296
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:46,260
with no money or help from him for almost seven years she gave him another chance and hunted him

297
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:50,100
down to be a dad rose was a little overwhelmed and asked mike if he could visit while cody was

298
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:54,580
visiting mike's wife forged paper saying my sister gave him custody of cody two years later after

299
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,340
emma visited for thanksgiving they removed emma saying there was abuse that was unfounded we went

300
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:01,780
to court and got a judge that was prejudiced against women with bipolar and wouldn't even

301
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:05,060
look at our evidence that mike was unstable and abusive and gave him the kids in august

302
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:08,740
a friend of ours came across their videos and told us about them we contacted the police

303
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:12,580
immediately they did a report here and sent it to maryland which she included the document showing

304
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:15,860
the redacted version because i don't want to share addresses and personal information and maryland

305
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:19,220
told us it was corporal punishment they refused to do anything even though we talked to doctors

306
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,140
and other professionals who say it is clearly abuse of all kinds we are just so worried who

307
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:27,380
knows what kind of damage this is doing i can't confirm if every single detail of this is true or

308
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:33,060
not but i consider it very plausible given the circumstances and with that publicly looming over

309
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:37,460
them they no longer have their fans just to preach to this is the video that stopped me from putting

310
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:41,860
out my video on them because i respected their children now i think for many the custody of cody

311
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:47,060
and emma to their biological mother was a very satisfying ending to an emotional saga but it was

312
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:52,820
just the start for the daddio five family to victimize themselves further look at what they've

313
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:59,940
lost all for a few light-hearted pranks that got out of hand oh no the tragedy on top of this they

314
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,020
were actually prosecuted for their treatment of their children and placed on probation a decision

315
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:09,300
that i will probably respond to in a bit i mean let's be clear youtube made absolutely no mistake

316
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:13,540
by booting them off the platform and every single one of the following repercussions were completely

317
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:18,740
justified as well even if it was just pranks you can't expect social services to be happy with that

318
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:23,300
especially following public uproar which once again good job on people for taking a stance

319
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:27,540
and making the shitty legal system actually respond but at the same time with all the

320
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:32,980
punishment mike positioned himself as a foolish man who didn't know better but now he has learned

321
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:38,020
and doesn't deserve to be deprived any further and this was convincing enough for some people

322
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:44,580
i just wanted to take care of everybody i just wanted you guys we wanted them to be happy we just

323
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:49,140
wanted our kids to be happy and we went about it the wrong way the thing is youtube's biggest

324
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:54,660
mistake was actually allowing daddy o5 to continue on the platform at all after losing custody of two

325
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:59,060
of their children and once again giving them nothing much else to lose they rebranded to

326
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:04,500
family o5 in which they continued many of their antics now of course the content was now watered

327
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,020
down with some moments that are done with the conviction of tommy wiseau

328
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,900
however there was still content that was angry and edgy enough to bring that audience back

329
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:42,900
i'm trying to stop you from coming from the script

330
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:56,020
with the new channel with the spotlight firmly off the family from the moment with it off daddy

331
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:01,940
o3 he takes multiple breaks to talk about how hard done by he is in an excellent video by creator

332
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:06,020
amanda the jedi she observes these exact techniques ones that would have been taken

333
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:10,740
apart by larger creators if they were still on the other channel but now had a free place for

334
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:16,100
their fans to feel sympathetic towards them they lost so much with nothing too much else to lose

335
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:20,580
they knew they could milk what they had lost for the expense of very little else you'd think that

336
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,940
maybe they'd apologize for the things that happened and that they were going to change

337
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:29,940
and and make make things different make things more fun make it a genuine family fun friendly

338
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:35,860
channel but no when mike comes back he complains what's up team do5

339
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:47,220
oh man my wife has been driving me crazy has been driving me crazy about starting back up this

340
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:52,020
gaming channel and even my therapist has been on me about starting this gaming channel they both

341
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:57,060
think that it'll be really good for me to do this they think that it will help bounce me out

342
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:04,740
of my depression and stuff like that i remember i used to be so happy that we were out of our

343
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:22,260
bad neighborhood we were so happy everybody was happy as hell

344
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:44,660
the camera this was a channel with approximately 300 000 subscribers videos that pulled views and

345
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:49,540
it clearly wasn't as extreme but equally having that smudge on their reputation i really don't

346
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:54,500
know why youtube would have tolerated it that long and it was still fairly intense and eventually

347
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,740
they did respond to the fact that they were still uploading and the fact that policy wise

348
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:03,780
they shouldn't really be able to and they kicked the family o5 channel too but by doing this they

349
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:09,380
prolonged daddy o3's constant struggle against those horrible evil mainstream elites so in

350
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:14,820
their tragedy they once again milked the situation by starting a passion i think they mean petition

351
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:20,180
to bring back the poor persecuted daddy o5 there was also a video uploaded where the martin's

352
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:24,820
sons basically power at the same talking points their father made times before they really are

353
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:30,580
troopers and of course the sad piano music adds another delicious dimension just pulls on your

354
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:42,740
heartstrings so we got shut down for nothing at the end of the day youtube terminated your channel

355
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,420
once which gave you no right to have another channel and the fact that you were still allowed

356
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:51,220
to operate on youtube for so long should have been considered a privilege oh and of course

357
00:32:51,220 --> 00:33:00,740
don't forget about those real fans and you all know you the real fans know how good of parents

358
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:05,300
mom and dad are but this is the thing through this they had successfully emotionally appealed

359
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:10,820
to a lot of audiences who were trying to confirm a biased conception of daddy o5 as the victim

360
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:15,140
people who valued their own motivation for entertainment over the basic facts of the

361
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:19,780
situation were more than happy to take this explanation the daddy o5 had been unfairly

362
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:25,060
persecuted because it fit their world view and by having these kids deliver it in their quivering

363
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:29,860
confused voice it was more than enough for many people to be satisfied the thing is that mike

364
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:35,300
martin and to an extent his wife is the guy who punches the tiger and then complains when he has

365
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:40,420
his arm bitten off but for every time he loses a limb he continued to irritate the situation

366
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:47,140
just being more subtle every time oh guys i merely slapped the tiger uh uh guys i merely

367
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:53,540
poked the tiger guys come on i merely tickled the tiger considering this is the same tiger the

368
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:58,580
tiger isn't going to take chances and that first impression will rightfully stick with many people

369
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:04,020
you don't get a blank slate when you do something as outwardly horrific as that and then try to hold

370
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:09,220
onto the remnants as a brand and use it to play a victim card there will always be people who

371
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:14,980
feel bad for the guy and call out the tiger to be put down how could such a savage animal bite off

372
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:20,820
the arms of a poor helpless man daddy o5 positions himself as the underdog when really he received

373
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:25,940
the repercussions that he asked for he is someone who baits these situations that can be seen with

374
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:30,820
his behavior on youtube but eventually the bait will blur the lines of morality which is where

375
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:36,420
we come to today's situation

376
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:58,660
you see what i've shown here is how daddy o5 made the most of everything that happened against him

377
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:03,140
even though many of us would agree that it is justified there will always be an audience who

378
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:08,340
discard that narrative in favor of what they enjoy and every time he's continued to irritate the

379
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:13,220
system and it has responded because they know his brand and they know what he likes he continues to

380
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:18,820
cry about it and yes i believe people can completely change and that is reflected in a lot of my

381
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:23,940
philosophy but what daddy o5 has done on this platform is so beyond redemption that he has to

382
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:29,300
accept any consequences that come his way you can't bounce back from something like that from

383
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:35,060
both a business and even morally oriented standpoint i'm gonna be honest i think mike got

384
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:39,620
off lightly i think they were far too nice with him with the probation in my opinion he should

385
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:44,580
have been sent to jail for what he did along with his wife especially to cody and he should be

386
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:49,700
grateful that it's extremely difficult to fully evaluate and legislate against psychological

387
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:54,580
trauma because if you go back and watch videos like nerd cities it's unbelievable levels of

388
00:35:54,580 --> 00:36:00,180
emotional torture that children like cody cannot process and then blaming it on him when he acts

389
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:07,140
out is just unbelievable publicly creating this image that promoted a sick twisted mentality to

390
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:14,100
punish him further i wish he would behave himself and act like normal child normal kids have bad

391
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:23,460
behaviors cody has something else so up until now i have argued that most of the repercussions

392
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:27,620
that occurred on the platform were completely warranted it must be noted that i never support

393
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:31,620
threatening individuals and by doing so you give them an extra way to play victim as well

394
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:36,740
though that is assuming all the events claimed by daddy o3 did actually happen but hey benefit of

395
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:42,820
the doubt even for someone like him it's not necessary to the argument however with the latest

396
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:47,620
move documented by some the lines become increasingly blurred basically the new youtube

397
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:53,220
channel is dedicated to mike and heather martin's sons the martin boys and many people were claiming

398
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:59,220
that daddy is heavily involved they've uploaded a few videos one in which they eat food good for

399
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:03,460
them and many people are questioning whether they should be on the site and are criticizing them

400
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:09,300
for having a platform and so on this has led daddy o3 to respond what you'll see is a classic

401
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,700
situation but one where the lines are more blurred this time the sons have a channel and

402
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:18,500
now daddy o5 is picking up that victim car and talking about all these people attacking him for

403
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:23,460
having his sons on youtube he's private his account he's spoken about it on his twitch stream kids

404
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:28,500
doing their youtube thing people are attacking them thinking it's my channel how stupid are they

405
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:36,100
care about your kids so much let me attack them and have their channel shut down

406
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:43,860
let me make a video talking shit about them and send hate over to them so i can get my views on

407
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:51,060
my channel because i have no creative process and and the only way i could be creative is if i

408
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:59,620
bully and you know just make someone else's life miserable fuck out of here man my heart breaks

409
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:05,060
let the kids be kids and you know what i agree i don't think that the children although morally

410
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:09,940
dubious in many of their actions complicit with their father should necessarily be prevented from

411
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:15,060
ever operating a channel but what's been done here is that it struck the sweet spot between just

412
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:20,100
and unjust they're still operating under the martin brand and they're still using the martin

413
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:25,780
fan base however in my opinion they should be able to have a channel nonetheless people criticizing

414
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:31,220
it is not a case to play victim because once again daddy o3 is tempting the tiger and that victim

415
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:35,860
card is going to be used again and again to retain those fans who have convinced themselves

416
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:40,820
that he is the one who has suffered undeservedly the martin boys themselves have promoted a brand

417
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:45,380
and the brand website which we'll discuss in a moment if mike wants to detach himself from the

418
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:49,940
channel he's doing it in the worst way possible but we all know he doesn't a lot of people think

419
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:55,700
him responding is out of insecurity it's not just that it's a case of cultivating a fan base through

420
00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:00,500
their perceived notion of victimhood and trying to leave reality in the back of their mind daddy

421
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,900
o5 is not a vick he has a twitch channel which does all right and he gives out stellar advice

422
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:12,340
on curing depression as well best way to handle depression is to stop being depression

423
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,940
the more you know

424
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:24,260
because if you just stop being depressed you won't even be depressed no more

425
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:31,140
and he has an instagram where he can post hell he has his own website the real antics are on

426
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:36,020
his family of five domain which really is the only way to keep himself going now because as

427
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:41,700
this title implies you can never get rid of daddy o5 as much as we detest who he is this is what

428
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:46,740
has happened he has grown that fan base out of persecution and then taken them to a corner of

429
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:51,620
the internet where he can cover them and provide them with videos for the very affordable cost of

430
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:57,380
five dollars a month using that exact same persona to string them along about how he is the victim

431
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:02,660
he has community posts where he's the victim he has tweets where he's the victim he has instagram

432
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:17,380
videos where he is the victim this man the abuser he's the victim guys and if we paid five dollars

433
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:22,500
to see that sweet daddy content we probably have videos where he's the victim too alongside him

434
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:29,220
screaming at his kids and having the paywall immediately places a moral dilemma onto anyone

435
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:34,180
who wants to continue criticizing their content do you pay five dollars and help support them and

436
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:39,300
risk finding content that is nothing particularly to write home about or do you go leave it behind

437
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:44,500
and risk possibly some very questionable stuff going on behind the scenes family o5 has it

438
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:49,060
locked down for now and there's nothing anyone can really do about it he has taken advantage

439
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:54,580
at every turn however i don't want it to seem like daddy o5 is some kind of mastermind because he

440
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:58,980
isn't and i'm sure masterminds would be doing something much more with their lives he merely

441
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:03,140
filled a gap in the market that is extremely morally questionable and they've worked out how

442
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:08,180
to make people feel better about it and then using that entertainment to string along a load of sadists

443
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:13,460
to engage in his content and support him through those tribulations i do not know how many fans he

444
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:17,940
has right now but hopefully as time passes and the kids grow up the world will run dry

445
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:23,060
just like with his first ever pranks he'll likely continue to push the boundary until someone hits

446
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:28,660
back and then he can claim to be the victim again and start some fresh fresh drama which is why it's

447
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:33,380
not worth attacking the martin boys personally let youtube decide what they want to do with it

448
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:37,860
and try not to give mike any ammunition to cry about it i'm not saying you shouldn't criticize

449
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:42,180
them go ahead be my guest you know i'm making a video criticizing them what i'm saying is if you

450
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:46,980
are criticizing them make sure you're taking the high road however if the martin boys's channel

451
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:51,540
does become integrated with the family of five brand more tightly people should then speak up

452
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:56,740
a bit more mike martin is a persistent bastard and he has created something through that persistence

453
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:02,100
he doesn't have much else going for him he knows that given his public reputation this might be all

454
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:06,660
he has left and he is resting on the shoulders of fans who he has convinced that he is the one who

455
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:10,980
has all the wrongdoing against him but those shoulders will not carry him forever and although

456
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:15,700
i would argue he has never had to fully face down the consequences of his actions i like to leave

457
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:20,740
you with a quote from native american author vine deloria jr from his book custard died for your

458
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:25,060
sins which by the way is an excellent read if you enjoy cultural discussion with a great dose of

459
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:29,540
sarcasm anyhow the quote that always stuck out to me since reading is the one at the end of chapter

460
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:35,860
four you see the wheel of karma grinds slowly but it does grind finally and it makes a complete

461
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:40,580
mike i'm sure the circle will be complete in the end

462
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:48,740
so yes that was the video probably one of my longer ones but there you go i would love to

463
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:54,100
hear your thoughts on the daddy 05 situation always open to a bit of discussion down below

464
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:58,420
really appreciate the support of recent pretty sure by the time this will be out probably be over

465
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:05,380
100 000 but you never know you never know we live and hope my friends oh my god wow

466
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:10,180

donated a hundred dollars generosity exceeds his beauty i'm sure i don't think i have too much

471
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:34,820
else to say i hope everyone's having a lovely day and i hope this has made their day a little

472
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:39,700
lovely even though the dark nature of the topic i hope i've managed to engage you until then

473
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:48,660
