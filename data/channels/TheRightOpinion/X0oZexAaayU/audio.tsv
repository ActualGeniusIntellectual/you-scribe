0	8960	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
8960	14380	too much free time, and today we discuss a daddy that isn't Keemstar, what a shock.
14380	18920	No today we shall be talking about the infamous Daddy05, to those who are unaware of this
18920	24320	gent he is a family vlogger slash prankster, I use those terms very liberally, who found
24320	29140	himself on the rocks a few years back, he was both shaken and stirred. Why? Well if
29140	33540	you don't know you'll soon find out. Because my friends we are going back to a blast from
33540	37620	the past, but we shall begin with a little anecdote as always, because I have actually
37620	43060	made a video on Daddy05, although no one has ever seen it. You see as an artist, if that's
43060	47160	what you can call my work at least, I have started, scripted and worked on many videos
47160	51280	that will probably never see the light of day. That is the case for pretty much anyone
51280	56060	in the creative industry, it's about running with a lot of ideas, some of which do not
56060	60380	work, sometimes we realise these ideas don't work three lines into scripting them, sometimes
60380	64500	we realise they don't work three years after you uploaded them, that is the life of the
64500	70460	miserable creator. However the Daddy05 video was a classic case of changing circumstances,
70460	75700	I had a video, uploaded it to YouTube, was ready to drop some very stinging criticism,
75700	79580	had a big saucy thumbnail, and suddenly this video dropped.
98620	103380	And I felt these circumstances had changed. The thing about Daddy05 is that it was a situation
103380	107380	that greatly put his children in the spotlight, and regardless of whether they were sincere
107380	111380	about this apology or not, I was not going to continue to drag them to something which
111380	115740	they had shown a motivation to change philosophy in, there were children involved, and the
115740	120980	apology video changed the context to the point where I no longer felt confident in my upload.
120980	125700	Now that the dust is settled, hopefully firstly I can quell my allergic reaction, and secondly
125700	131140	I can look into the situation and the legacy with fresh eyes. What was he apologising for?
131220	135700	I'll explain the details very soon, but he was facing down a number of serious allegations
135700	140180	and evidence that the creation of his content was being elicited through the abuse of his
140180	143380	children, something not to be taken lightly at all.
161140	180180	He
180180	184420	was terminated by the YouTube gods for his transgressions, and likely because the media
184420	189700	were picking up on it, and YouTube's relationship with the media is quite rocky, and no compromises
189700	195140	can be taken when it comes to their reputation, to say the least, and we as human beings continued
195140	200020	with our daily lives. So why bring it back now? Well for a few reasons, first one being
200020	204820	some cheeky twats over on Twitter tagged me in a thread asking me to cover it, now I want
204820	209460	to make this clear, I do not often take requests, but if there's enough meat on the bone I'll
209460	213540	throw myself into the ring. The only reason I'm saying this is the last time I credited
213540	218500	someone's request, I was bombarded with requests of the newest naughty YouTuber, and I only
218500	223300	have so much time on this planet, I'm really sorry guys, I'm not saying don't send me
223300	227620	spicy news on people, I'm just saying don't get your hopes up. So I was mulling on this
227620	232420	for a while, and then I saw my Good Acquaintance Priminx video, which reignited my passion
232420	236180	for the whole debacle, because although the barebones information was something that I
236180	240580	was aware of, seeing someone expressing their opinion on it interested me further, and then
240580	244980	the fact that Daddy05 threw a tantrum in response made me think that maybe there is a bit more
244980	249060	to this story than we give it credit for, because the story in the headlines is that
249060	255140	Daddy05 is back, back in what way? Has he had his channel restored? Well, not really,
255140	260500	but you see Daddy05 never technically left, they were on YouTube until a few months back,
260500	264980	when YouTube clearly probably decided that they'd had enough of that platform as well,
264980	269460	and chucked them off, in which there was a very emotional video uploaded onto another channel,
269460	274420	alas their tears fell upon the frosty heart of the viewer, but a few months later they
274420	279620	are once again back, as Primink documents, but not exactly, you see their children now
279620	284260	have a channel in which they create their own content that is owned by the grandparents,
284260	289780	so Daddy05 claims to be not associated at all, the channel is known as the Martin Boys,
289780	294180	which is comprised of the three remaining siblings, after the biological mother of Cody
294180	298580	and Emma regained custody. There aren't too many indications of where this channel is going,
298580	302820	or what exactly it's going to be about, but one can assume it won't be too sinister,
302820	306580	given how I'm sure the Martin family are aware they're on thin ice.
306580	310420	Nonetheless, it seems there are some questions about the ethics of this whole debacle,
310420	315860	with Daddy05 positioning himself as a staunch defender of the lads rights to do what they want,
315860	320420	while also decrying any association with it. This has opened a whole new debate
320420	324580	about the morality of it, and frankly I find it all a bit messy.
324580	332500	Everyone's saying, oh Daddy05 is back, Family05 is back, no, no I'm not, I don't own a YouTube
332500	338820	channel, I have nothing to do with the Martin Boys YouTube channel, I do not own that channel,
338820	343860	my name is not on that channel anywhere, nothing on that channel links back to me
344420	351300	in any way shape or form, the Boys grandparents own that channel, they run that channel, and I
351300	358500	have nothing to do with it, stop giving me shit about a channel that I don't have nothing to do
358500	363380	with, I don't have access to it, I don't have anything to do with it, stop giving the Boys shit
363940	371940	about their YouTube channel, I have nothing to do with it, it's not even mine, you're being stupid,
372580	386660	I found that revisiting the whole topic has showed it to be incredibly appealing,
386660	391620	and my plan will be to open a discussion on a multitude of Martin's actions and behaviours,
391620	396740	particularly on how they rose to infamy, and how this rise can indicate a very simple longevity
396740	401300	that will be detestable to most people, but irresistible to a select few that will keep
401300	406340	their channel alive, equally I do not want this to be some simple analysis, because I do have a
406340	411540	lot to say that I held off on the day, and a lot of these sentiments still ring true now, so expect
411540	416740	a mix and match, today we're going to be discussing a lot, but you see to touch all bases you have to
416740	420740	hit a home run, and that's what I plan to do, because out of all the topics that I've covered,
420740	425620	I say this one has some of the most psychological discussions there are, so without further ado I
425620	430500	suggest we dive into DaddyOFive and explain the numerous phenomena that drive such a situation
430500	436100	that still has implications to this day, I cannot wait, and neither should you, let's get to it.
442340	448020	Now, DaddyOFive's channel was set up in 2015, however as noted it has been terminated,
448020	453940	so we rely on the remnants that history leaves us with to be able to make judgement of such content,
453940	458580	nonetheless we don't necessarily need specific details of DaddyOFive's channel to understand
458660	463940	everything that probably caused his channel to thrive, because 2015 was the year of the prank,
463940	468180	now I'm not going to make up any bullshit and say that pranks were only big in 2015,
468180	473220	they still exist to this day, many creators are still incredibly successful off the back of them,
473220	477780	and there is no doubt in my mind that it will continue to thrive for years to come at least,
477780	483860	however 2015 was the year that we had multiple controversies surrounding pranks, prank invasion,
483860	489300	Sam Pepper, and so on, it was a huge year for the pranksters, and this is where we discuss the
489300	494020	rise of the prank in the first place, the rise of the prank is a rather unsettling one, because
494020	498660	there will always be an audience for these pranks, needless to say I am not a fan of them at all,
498660	503940	but people love to see others in natural environments be fooled, while the audience
503940	509300	are completely aware of it, it's that dynamic, equally the notion of a prank can often make
509300	515060	creators conduct more extreme actions and excuse it under the notion of a prank, such as the
515060	520740	multiple social experiments, of course as a defence this is valid to an extent, but it's also
520740	525380	what creates the unique environment for pranks to thrive in, because you can't just stand around
525380	530180	expecting those situations to happen naturally, a social experiment is, although certainly not
530180	534500	conducted within the means of scientific reliability, an appropriate name for what many
534500	538660	of these YouTubers do, they manipulate an environment and then expose the reaction of
538660	543380	those in it, that is the trend that DaddyOFive appeared to jump on most enthusiastically,
543380	547780	the prank, now the prank typically involves deceiving the participant, and many immediately
547780	553300	would raise ethical claims, however sometimes deception is necessary to understand how humans
553300	558180	act in certain situations, for example the Milgram experiment, I'm not going to go into
558180	563140	details about it because it's fairly irrelevant, but it's a sobering study on the human condition,
563140	568100	and a perfect example of how sometimes we need to deceive participants to get to the truth,
568100	572820	and I'd recommend checking it out if you haven't, it wouldn't have been obtained otherwise.
572820	576740	However, with the notion of a prank, the deception is what makes it entertaining,
576740	580980	which once again in many situations is fine, particularly when considering that a majority
580980	585540	of pranks slash social experiments were fake, and although we can definitely be annoyed at the
585540	589460	people for faking them and misleading their audience, I'm glad that some of the direct
589460	593620	shock that many of the subjects of their videos appear to endure wasn't actually real,
593620	597620	because those situations, particularly ones where you have a bloody bomb thrown at your feet,
597620	603140	can be pretty intense and raises significant ethical questions. DaddyOFive appeared to start
603140	608100	off his channel in a fairly less extreme prank direction, with content that was stupid and
608100	613060	idiotic but still that you could see might pass under YouTube's radar, however probably seeing
613060	619220	the success in violence and seeing the audience response made them more motivated to become more
619300	624580	hands-on. But why on earth would more people want to see something which is, without debate,
624580	629620	much more aggressive and unpleasant? The thing is, revisiting DaddyOFive made
629620	634260	me realise that there is a significant audience that never really cared about ethics, what a
634260	638020	surprise. They didn't care about people's wellbeing, they're the sort of people who
638020	642180	see a crime and pull out their iPhones and say they were just recording for evidence.
642180	646740	The simple truth is, and there is no two ways about it, what made DaddyOFive so successful
646740	650340	was that it doesn't matter whether they were branded as pranks or a joke,
650340	655460	DaddyOFive provided the closest glimpse into the human reaction of a quote prank,
655460	659620	because it is an up-close first-person perspective of something that you feel.
659620	664180	And let me tell you, those emotions are very real, I was rewatching some of his Xbox pranks
664180	669540	on a reupload channel, and I had to stop because I was crying, I was angry, I was enraged at how
669540	674420	he treated Cody, and yet with a bit of emotional distance, that's what some people wanted,
674420	679060	because that demographic existed. The realism is furthered once you acknowledge the fact that
679060	683780	these people are children, and children are more likely to be emotionally volatile and react in
683780	688260	such a way. People like chaos, people like volatility, everyone likes a prank where
688260	692420	someone gets really angry, but whereas many pranksters were just plain actors,
692420	697860	Mike Martin's channel had exhibits of the most raw aggression possible, and people ate it up.
697860	702580	No one else did that, and no one else should do it, and most people couldn't do it. The emotional
702580	707620	intimacy of having a situation like that would be impossible, how can you expose yourself to that
707620	711940	level of suffering of your own children? But that's the thing, they weren't his own children,
711940	713540	and this matters more than you think.
718900	723460	Did you see this game when I sliced open his guts? I never felt so alive!
723460	725620	Yeah, well you've been alive for like two minutes.
726580	730580	While they do mess with the kids, a lot of the time it seems directed towards one specific kid,
730580	733620	and that is Cody. While in the family video where they defended themselves, they said, you know,
733620	737860	the kids get to decide if the video goes up, they also acknowledge that they have so much cool stuff
737860	741620	thanks to having a YouTube channel. So by getting stuff, they're incentivized to allow the parents
741620	746100	to upload these videos, even though the little kid Cody is very obviously not a fan of them.
746100	749700	The youngest and the weakest and the most sensitive kid, Cody,
749700	753700	is always nursing an injury, he's always covered in bruises. From video to video,
753700	756740	there are signs of abuse all over his arms, his legs, his face.
757300	761540	Generally there's a psychological phenomenon known as the Cinderella effect. Now I don't want to give
761540	765940	too much credit to this theory, as I do not find the research on it to be the most reliable under
765940	770740	closer scrutiny, but basically what it dictates is that step-parents are more likely to be abusive
770740	775460	to their children than their biological parents. Now although I believe the impacts are overstated
775460	779540	in certain circumstances, I do think there's a serious case to be made here of why certain
779540	783780	children were such targets. This is an evolutionary theory, and Mike and Heather
783780	788180	seem rather primitive to say the least. There seems to be this emotional distance. In the
788180	793140	Drama Alert interview, Heather has this very unsettling way of referring to Cody as quote
793140	802900	the boy. Interesting as she is the step-parent, once again, given the whole seedy nature of how
802900	807940	they gain custody over him, it genuinely would not surprise me if that emotional distance from
807940	812500	the adoption and subsequent alienation led to them being the greater targets of the abuse.
812500	817140	On top of this, what would then happen is you'd see these very weird ways of justifying the abuse,
817140	821380	which was probably both a technique for them and for their audience that somehow it wasn't
821380	826420	their fault. After all, in many households, punitive measures are seen as fairly straightforward,
826420	831060	even though this was clearly extreme, if you have someone who is punitively inclined, they see
831060	835780	Heather and Mike talking these children down, it will fall into their sphere of perceptibility.
835780	839620	I'll probably talk about this more in a future video than I have planned, but this is basically
839620	844740	the psychological techniques that led to these children being treated differently in my opinion,
844740	849540	and it seemed to yield from the fact that they didn't have that same connection, and the parents
849540	854100	actively tried to neglect it, particularly in the mother's instance. When people made exposed
854100	858500	videos on DaddyOFive, they rightfully highlighted the worst of his channel, but the thing is by
858500	862980	ignoring the best of his channel, it gave them a get-out-of-jail-free card, the oh well you don't
862980	867860	see the good side of DaddyOFive, there's a channel with a whole video dedicated to it, where they
867860	895140	just play the emotional music, over the riveting clips, but really this was just another
895140	900660	manipulation tactic to somehow once again create a moral delusion to justify the abuse, to try and
900660	906100	make people think, oh I guess he was alright after it all. Happy times do not negate abusive
906100	910740	or violent ones, that's like saying if Joe Blow punches his wife in the face, calls or slurs,
910740	915540	but that's only like 5-10% of the time, the other 90% of the time it's just good, he's sweet,
915540	920660	he cares, he apologizes, no the good times do not negate the abuse, that is a very important thing
920660	926100	to know. The truth is you can't orchestrate the child's emotions in many of the videos,
926100	931140	and then say, oh well he's happy in certain moments that somehow justifies it, I had many
931140	935300	happy moments in my childhood, it doesn't change the terrible things that happened to me and the
935300	939220	lasting effects they have to this day, and if the people who did those things were to come to my
939220	943860	house with a box of chocolates and an apology, I'd appreciate it, but it wouldn't justify their
943860	948980	actions. There is no prank, but people didn't care, and Mike clearly didn't care, he was
948980	954500	extracting money out of that kid like an ATM, and exploiting that emotional distance so he felt no
954500	959300	repercussions for his actions, and people watched it, after all, they're not responsible are they,
959300	963940	they're just a single view, watching cruel and crazy videos on the internet, isn't that what
963940	968500	people do? The thing is this isn't some third party testimony where you get to watch it on the
968500	973460	news, some found footage, this was literally a person making money out of direct abuse and
973460	979220	people let him reach 700,000 before others had to intervene. This is a situation like no other,
979220	983300	and the fact that many people didn't have to experience the consequences directly of their
983300	987460	actions meant they didn't feel responsible for whatever happened. On the other hand,
987460	992660	you probably had a smaller but more dedicated fanbase of actual sadists who used the first
992660	997460	person perspective that Mike often provided to live out violent fantasies that they themselves
997460	998580	were not prepared to commit.
1028020	1031140	uh all the kids need to gang up on jake at once
1031780	1039140	tie him down and torture him king broton you're right why the hell is cody such a damn liar thief
1039140	1046020	and evil nobody deserves his crap you did the right thing daddy five but this monster deserves
1046180	1046580	this
1057380	1062740	the internet is screwed everyone knows this and youtube is a target as much as anywhere else for
1062740	1067460	these people to congregate and create their cruel little circles where they pose whatever fulfills
1067460	1072260	their twisted desires i can't stop people from being inherently fucked up because some people
1072340	1076660	always will be but what you can do is put the well-being of others first and know that if you
1076660	1081940	were to enact your desires a lot of people would suffer and maybe reconsider your position on
1081940	1087380	supporting such content essentially daddy o5's rise to the near top of the youtube totem pole
1087380	1091860	was done through distorting a reality that made fans feel secure in their support of him whether
1091860	1096500	it was through the emotional distance or through the tonal shifts that created an illusion and yet
1096500	1101460	showed reality so raw that many people felt compelled to watch it's morally reprehensible
1101460	1106820	but no one wanted to take responsibility equally by taking the ever popular notion of a prank
1106820	1112100	and upping the realism to 11 he created something that without moral boundaries appeal to people
1112100	1117140	which they then justified in their own heads with daddy o5 doing something no one else would really
1117140	1122260	do and for good reason too the videos that mike made were absolutely appalling and there is no
1122260	1126900	doubt in my mind that they had to be removed but by letting them fester for so long martin had
1126900	1131860	created a fan base some of these fans left after mike was exposed whether it was for the moral
1131860	1136980	epiphany or just the fact that he'd no longer be uploading his brilliant content is probably down
1136980	1141780	to the individual but either way that was when the exodus occurred but as always there were
1141780	1146900	many stragglers who stuck around for various reasons and daddy o5 pulled out all the stock
1146900	1164020	to keep them on his side youtube had no option it doesn't matter if it was all taken out of context
1164020	1169060	which it wasn't there was no way that they could let that sort of reputation gather on a site that
1169060	1173940	was facing down tough times anymore i am for a free and open youtube but equally there was a
1173940	1179060	line and the only use those videos should have been for was custody evidence you see the issue
1179060	1184900	with daddy o5 is that he epitomizes the classic action consequence dynamic that helps drive many
1184900	1189780	of the exiled individuals from the internet this is always the situation with the platforming and
1189780	1194020	why it has been handled very sensitively when someone conducts themselves in a way in which
1194020	1198820	some people may feel affects them they may act on what they decide to be justice the problem is the
1198820	1203460	perception of justice is completely subject to the individual and when you take action against
1203540	1207860	someone you'll always give them some sort of power to use that narrative and make themselves
1207860	1212180	a victim does this mean you shouldn't take retributive action of course not you just have
1212180	1217060	to work out how to make sure people can understand that in the context of the situation your listed
1217060	1222100	justice was righteous and businesses often don't feel the need to do that after all people aren't
1222100	1226580	entitled to an explanation and one thing that we've found is that every time youtube opens its
1226580	1232340	mouth someone tends to get hurt equally however it does mean that those who you will remove have
1232340	1237460	all the platform to scream and holler about it and so on daddy o5 provided content that no one
1237460	1242660	else could which is why people firstly watched him and secondly tried to twist the content into
1242660	1247700	a morally justifiable mold which meant that when daddy o5 decided that he was ready to play victim
1247700	1252980	there was an army of fans ready to come to his aid so first came the original response video now
1252980	1258660	people hated this video many people did rightfully so but equally it created a sect of intense daddy
1258820	1263860	o5 loyalists through the narratives crafted titled false acquisitions another stunning
1263860	1268180	display of martin's intellect he decides to respond to some of these claims but equally
1268180	1274260	tries to keep the fans on board we're gonna make things right we're gonna make things right and i
1274260	1281060	want everyone to feel comfortable and know that these kids are safe that this is all an act
1281060	1285940	firstly it set up the precipice that his videos were fake normally this would be a compromise on
1285940	1290660	the appeal of your channel's content but martin knew that he was on borrowed time as it was and
1290660	1294980	couldn't continue his current brand anyway therefore in this instance claiming your videos
1294980	1300820	are fake immediately plays into that narrative the reason why i say claiming rather than admitting is
1300820	1305540	that it's such a tactical decision that i highly doubt they were fake and even if they were children
1305540	1310180	like cody have no way to discern that and it's clear it caused a lot of genuine trauma therefore
1310180	1315380	their defiance just really exposed how deceptive they were willing to be to maintain some semblance
1315380	1320260	of audience stating that these videos were fake played credence into some people's minds and
1320260	1326900	makes them feel better about supporting this madman uh cody is going to grow up to be an actor
1326900	1332580	um i'm pretty sure of that which page in the script involved a stepbrother punching cody in
1332580	1336500	the head he was being pinned on the ground and he got kicked in the crotch was that just kind of an
1336500	1342180	ad lib thing are they method actors then they claim they put disclaimer that it was all just
1342180	1348260	for entertainment purposes which just makes it all right i put in the video description for
1348260	1355060	entertainment purposes early i categorize the videos as entertainment or comedy something that
1355060	1361780	i know i've even used keywords a few times i use the word fake in the keywords and stuff a few times
1361780	1365940	this is embarrassing but still it was a confirmation bias to people who wanted to
1365940	1370820	hear that then they do the classic greg paul technique of reaffirming loyalty by branding
1370820	1377060	them as real fans and praising the ones who stick with them after this i i we just wanted to make
1377060	1383060	videos for you guys and we truly appreciate the love and support that you guys our real fans have
1383060	1389380	given us over the last few days with everything that's going on and we're really sorry that we
1389380	1395860	have to disappoint you and say that this immediately detaches them from the horrible
1395860	1401300	mainstream moral normies and creates a reaffirmation of bond and pulls the dedicated
1401300	1406820	viewer in it creates a moral burden remaining with these people and they look tired and forlorn
1406820	1411700	they're the victims here guys can't you see all these false acquisitions have been weighing down
1411700	1416740	with them brings a tear to my eye another really important narrative you'll see is him talking
1416740	1423220	about the news once again the mainstream media is an easy target i mean i sure as hell don't like
1423220	1428100	them a bunch of sensationalist cowards but it doesn't mean they're wrong all the time however
1428100	1432420	the general distaste of the media allowed mike to move in and take advantage of it attacking the
1432420	1436660	news and lumping any of his critics in with it as well it's also a power play attacking the
1436660	1441300	mainstream media 99 percent of the time is going to come across as punching up and punching up
1441300	1445220	makes you look more justified in your position because of some perceived institutional power
1445220	1449540	they hold while name-dropping philip defranco for merely reporting it and setting his delightful
1449540	1454420	fans on him it's clear that they didn't really know how to respond this is a peak victim narrative
1454420	1458660	and once again it plays off that collateral dynamic that it's philip's fault for documenting
1458660	1463140	this abuse rather than their fault for the abuse now they claim that the abuse is taken out of
1463140	1467540	context they claim that the threats they've been receiving somehow makes defranco responsible as
1467540	1474500	well it would have never got this out of hand if it wasn't for that defranco guy starting all of
1474500	1481540	this doing all of this to my family he's responsible for this their voices are emotional they've been
1481540	1486980	attacked someone get me a tissue i'm gonna gonna cry listen because defranco is a huge creator he
1486980	1491460	has that clout to lead to such instance because you made provocative videos when working out how
1491460	1495540	someone has contributed to your hatred you have to look at their presentation sometimes i've
1495540	1500020	criticized people for making individuals out to be worse than they actually are however defranco
1500020	1504740	just delivers a message on a situation that has been transpiring anyway the only difference was
1504740	1509540	his size and many people were left to make their own judgment which they did when you behave in a
1509540	1514100	way that instigates hatred upon yourself you have to be prepared to take it unless it comes from an
1514100	1518740	exaggerated or false narrative defranco wasn't even the initial incident that caused this it
1518740	1523780	was your ink prank he was merely publicizing it which he had every right to there was a range of
1523780	1528260	anger some people saying this is outright abuse of your children others saying this is not abuse
1528260	1531700	but these are asshole parents that are exploiting their children for money and hurting them
1531700	1535540	emotionally and then it also appears that they have a dedicated audience that are completely
1535540	1541780	fine with it crimey river bitches anyhow there's a lot of back and forth and anger and eventually
1541780	1546580	the backlash from this video was felt people were angry and riled up and the walls were closing in
1546580	1558900	on them
1559060	1571220	oh
1574340	1578980	this is where it becomes interesting because the family then puts out a more regretful video
1578980	1583620	with the mum talking because although i'd say she's just as manipulative she's a bit more
1583620	1588260	subtle chances are this was probably motivated by the threat of losing custody to cody which
1588260	1592980	they subsequently did and there was a whole story behind this that had martin and his wife deceiving
1592980	1597460	the authorities into having custody over the children mike martin daddy of five left back
1597460	1602180	in 2008 when cody was one and emma was almost three my sister took care of those kids by herself
1602180	1606260	with no money or help from him for almost seven years she gave him another chance and hunted him
1606260	1610100	down to be a dad rose was a little overwhelmed and asked mike if he could visit while cody was
1610100	1614580	visiting mike's wife forged paper saying my sister gave him custody of cody two years later after
1614580	1618340	emma visited for thanksgiving they removed emma saying there was abuse that was unfounded we went
1618340	1621780	to court and got a judge that was prejudiced against women with bipolar and wouldn't even
1621780	1625060	look at our evidence that mike was unstable and abusive and gave him the kids in august
1625060	1628740	a friend of ours came across their videos and told us about them we contacted the police
1628740	1632580	immediately they did a report here and sent it to maryland which she included the document showing
1632580	1635860	the redacted version because i don't want to share addresses and personal information and maryland
1635860	1639220	told us it was corporal punishment they refused to do anything even though we talked to doctors
1639220	1643140	and other professionals who say it is clearly abuse of all kinds we are just so worried who
1643140	1647380	knows what kind of damage this is doing i can't confirm if every single detail of this is true or
1647380	1653060	not but i consider it very plausible given the circumstances and with that publicly looming over
1653060	1657460	them they no longer have their fans just to preach to this is the video that stopped me from putting
1657460	1661860	out my video on them because i respected their children now i think for many the custody of cody
1661860	1667060	and emma to their biological mother was a very satisfying ending to an emotional saga but it was
1667060	1672820	just the start for the daddio five family to victimize themselves further look at what they've
1672820	1679940	lost all for a few light-hearted pranks that got out of hand oh no the tragedy on top of this they
1679940	1684020	were actually prosecuted for their treatment of their children and placed on probation a decision
1684020	1689300	that i will probably respond to in a bit i mean let's be clear youtube made absolutely no mistake
1689300	1693540	by booting them off the platform and every single one of the following repercussions were completely
1693540	1698740	justified as well even if it was just pranks you can't expect social services to be happy with that
1698740	1703300	especially following public uproar which once again good job on people for taking a stance
1703300	1707540	and making the shitty legal system actually respond but at the same time with all the
1707540	1712980	punishment mike positioned himself as a foolish man who didn't know better but now he has learned
1712980	1718020	and doesn't deserve to be deprived any further and this was convincing enough for some people
1718020	1724580	i just wanted to take care of everybody i just wanted you guys we wanted them to be happy we just
1724580	1729140	wanted our kids to be happy and we went about it the wrong way the thing is youtube's biggest
1729140	1734660	mistake was actually allowing daddy o5 to continue on the platform at all after losing custody of two
1734660	1739060	of their children and once again giving them nothing much else to lose they rebranded to
1739060	1744500	family o5 in which they continued many of their antics now of course the content was now watered
1744500	1748020	down with some moments that are done with the conviction of tommy wiseau
1768340	1772900	however there was still content that was angry and edgy enough to bring that audience back
1774500	1782900	i'm trying to stop you from coming from the script
1791220	1796020	with the new channel with the spotlight firmly off the family from the moment with it off daddy
1796020	1801940	o3 he takes multiple breaks to talk about how hard done by he is in an excellent video by creator
1801940	1806020	amanda the jedi she observes these exact techniques ones that would have been taken
1806020	1810740	apart by larger creators if they were still on the other channel but now had a free place for
1810740	1816100	their fans to feel sympathetic towards them they lost so much with nothing too much else to lose
1816100	1820580	they knew they could milk what they had lost for the expense of very little else you'd think that
1820580	1823940	maybe they'd apologize for the things that happened and that they were going to change
1823940	1829940	and and make make things different make things more fun make it a genuine family fun friendly
1829940	1835860	channel but no when mike comes back he complains what's up team do5
1838180	1847220	oh man my wife has been driving me crazy has been driving me crazy about starting back up this
1847220	1852020	gaming channel and even my therapist has been on me about starting this gaming channel they both
1852020	1857060	think that it'll be really good for me to do this they think that it will help bounce me out
1857060	1864740	of my depression and stuff like that i remember i used to be so happy that we were out of our
1864740	1882260	bad neighborhood we were so happy everybody was happy as hell
1887380	1904660	the camera this was a channel with approximately 300 000 subscribers videos that pulled views and
1904660	1909540	it clearly wasn't as extreme but equally having that smudge on their reputation i really don't
1909540	1914500	know why youtube would have tolerated it that long and it was still fairly intense and eventually
1914500	1918740	they did respond to the fact that they were still uploading and the fact that policy wise
1918740	1923780	they shouldn't really be able to and they kicked the family o5 channel too but by doing this they
1923780	1929380	prolonged daddy o3's constant struggle against those horrible evil mainstream elites so in
1929380	1934820	their tragedy they once again milked the situation by starting a passion i think they mean petition
1934820	1940180	to bring back the poor persecuted daddy o5 there was also a video uploaded where the martin's
1940180	1944820	sons basically power at the same talking points their father made times before they really are
1944820	1950580	troopers and of course the sad piano music adds another delicious dimension just pulls on your
1950580	1962740	heartstrings so we got shut down for nothing at the end of the day youtube terminated your channel
1962740	1966420	once which gave you no right to have another channel and the fact that you were still allowed
1966420	1971220	to operate on youtube for so long should have been considered a privilege oh and of course
1971220	1980740	don't forget about those real fans and you all know you the real fans know how good of parents
1980740	1985300	mom and dad are but this is the thing through this they had successfully emotionally appealed
1985300	1990820	to a lot of audiences who were trying to confirm a biased conception of daddy o5 as the victim
1990820	1995140	people who valued their own motivation for entertainment over the basic facts of the
1995140	1999780	situation were more than happy to take this explanation the daddy o5 had been unfairly
1999780	2005060	persecuted because it fit their world view and by having these kids deliver it in their quivering
2005060	2009860	confused voice it was more than enough for many people to be satisfied the thing is that mike
2009860	2015300	martin and to an extent his wife is the guy who punches the tiger and then complains when he has
2015300	2020420	his arm bitten off but for every time he loses a limb he continued to irritate the situation
2020420	2027140	just being more subtle every time oh guys i merely slapped the tiger uh uh guys i merely
2027140	2033540	poked the tiger guys come on i merely tickled the tiger considering this is the same tiger the
2033540	2038580	tiger isn't going to take chances and that first impression will rightfully stick with many people
2038580	2044020	you don't get a blank slate when you do something as outwardly horrific as that and then try to hold
2044020	2049220	onto the remnants as a brand and use it to play a victim card there will always be people who
2049220	2054980	feel bad for the guy and call out the tiger to be put down how could such a savage animal bite off
2054980	2060820	the arms of a poor helpless man daddy o5 positions himself as the underdog when really he received
2060820	2065940	the repercussions that he asked for he is someone who baits these situations that can be seen with
2065940	2070820	his behavior on youtube but eventually the bait will blur the lines of morality which is where
2070820	2076420	we come to today's situation
2093220	2098660	you see what i've shown here is how daddy o5 made the most of everything that happened against him
2098660	2103140	even though many of us would agree that it is justified there will always be an audience who
2103140	2108340	discard that narrative in favor of what they enjoy and every time he's continued to irritate the
2108340	2113220	system and it has responded because they know his brand and they know what he likes he continues to
2113220	2118820	cry about it and yes i believe people can completely change and that is reflected in a lot of my
2118820	2123940	philosophy but what daddy o5 has done on this platform is so beyond redemption that he has to
2123940	2129300	accept any consequences that come his way you can't bounce back from something like that from
2129300	2135060	both a business and even morally oriented standpoint i'm gonna be honest i think mike got
2135060	2139620	off lightly i think they were far too nice with him with the probation in my opinion he should
2139620	2144580	have been sent to jail for what he did along with his wife especially to cody and he should be
2144580	2149700	grateful that it's extremely difficult to fully evaluate and legislate against psychological
2149700	2154580	trauma because if you go back and watch videos like nerd cities it's unbelievable levels of
2154580	2160180	emotional torture that children like cody cannot process and then blaming it on him when he acts
2160180	2167140	out is just unbelievable publicly creating this image that promoted a sick twisted mentality to
2167140	2174100	punish him further i wish he would behave himself and act like normal child normal kids have bad
2174100	2183460	behaviors cody has something else so up until now i have argued that most of the repercussions
2183460	2187620	that occurred on the platform were completely warranted it must be noted that i never support
2187620	2191620	threatening individuals and by doing so you give them an extra way to play victim as well
2191620	2196740	though that is assuming all the events claimed by daddy o3 did actually happen but hey benefit of
2196740	2202820	the doubt even for someone like him it's not necessary to the argument however with the latest
2202820	2207620	move documented by some the lines become increasingly blurred basically the new youtube
2207620	2213220	channel is dedicated to mike and heather martin's sons the martin boys and many people were claiming
2213220	2219220	that daddy is heavily involved they've uploaded a few videos one in which they eat food good for
2219220	2223460	them and many people are questioning whether they should be on the site and are criticizing them
2223460	2229300	for having a platform and so on this has led daddy o3 to respond what you'll see is a classic
2229300	2233700	situation but one where the lines are more blurred this time the sons have a channel and
2233700	2238500	now daddy o5 is picking up that victim car and talking about all these people attacking him for
2238500	2243460	having his sons on youtube he's private his account he's spoken about it on his twitch stream kids
2243460	2248500	doing their youtube thing people are attacking them thinking it's my channel how stupid are they
2250180	2256100	care about your kids so much let me attack them and have their channel shut down
2256100	2263860	let me make a video talking shit about them and send hate over to them so i can get my views on
2263860	2271060	my channel because i have no creative process and and the only way i could be creative is if i
2271060	2279620	bully and you know just make someone else's life miserable fuck out of here man my heart breaks
2279620	2285060	let the kids be kids and you know what i agree i don't think that the children although morally
2285060	2289940	dubious in many of their actions complicit with their father should necessarily be prevented from
2289940	2295060	ever operating a channel but what's been done here is that it struck the sweet spot between just
2295060	2300100	and unjust they're still operating under the martin brand and they're still using the martin
2300100	2305780	fan base however in my opinion they should be able to have a channel nonetheless people criticizing
2305780	2311220	it is not a case to play victim because once again daddy o3 is tempting the tiger and that victim
2311220	2315860	card is going to be used again and again to retain those fans who have convinced themselves
2315860	2320820	that he is the one who has suffered undeservedly the martin boys themselves have promoted a brand
2320820	2325380	and the brand website which we'll discuss in a moment if mike wants to detach himself from the
2325380	2329940	channel he's doing it in the worst way possible but we all know he doesn't a lot of people think
2329940	2335700	him responding is out of insecurity it's not just that it's a case of cultivating a fan base through
2335700	2340500	their perceived notion of victimhood and trying to leave reality in the back of their mind daddy
2340500	2344900	o5 is not a vick he has a twitch channel which does all right and he gives out stellar advice
2344900	2352340	on curing depression as well best way to handle depression is to stop being depression
2354980	2355940	the more you know
2359940	2364260	because if you just stop being depressed you won't even be depressed no more
2365060	2371140	and he has an instagram where he can post hell he has his own website the real antics are on
2371140	2376020	his family of five domain which really is the only way to keep himself going now because as
2376020	2381700	this title implies you can never get rid of daddy o5 as much as we detest who he is this is what
2381700	2386740	has happened he has grown that fan base out of persecution and then taken them to a corner of
2386740	2391620	the internet where he can cover them and provide them with videos for the very affordable cost of
2391620	2397380	five dollars a month using that exact same persona to string them along about how he is the victim
2397380	2402660	he has community posts where he's the victim he has tweets where he's the victim he has instagram
2402660	2417380	videos where he is the victim this man the abuser he's the victim guys and if we paid five dollars
2417380	2422500	to see that sweet daddy content we probably have videos where he's the victim too alongside him
2422500	2429220	screaming at his kids and having the paywall immediately places a moral dilemma onto anyone
2429220	2434180	who wants to continue criticizing their content do you pay five dollars and help support them and
2434180	2439300	risk finding content that is nothing particularly to write home about or do you go leave it behind
2439300	2444500	and risk possibly some very questionable stuff going on behind the scenes family o5 has it
2444500	2449060	locked down for now and there's nothing anyone can really do about it he has taken advantage
2449060	2454580	at every turn however i don't want it to seem like daddy o5 is some kind of mastermind because he
2454580	2458980	isn't and i'm sure masterminds would be doing something much more with their lives he merely
2458980	2463140	filled a gap in the market that is extremely morally questionable and they've worked out how
2463140	2468180	to make people feel better about it and then using that entertainment to string along a load of sadists
2468180	2473460	to engage in his content and support him through those tribulations i do not know how many fans he
2473460	2477940	has right now but hopefully as time passes and the kids grow up the world will run dry
2477940	2483060	just like with his first ever pranks he'll likely continue to push the boundary until someone hits
2483060	2488660	back and then he can claim to be the victim again and start some fresh fresh drama which is why it's
2488660	2493380	not worth attacking the martin boys personally let youtube decide what they want to do with it
2493380	2497860	and try not to give mike any ammunition to cry about it i'm not saying you shouldn't criticize
2497860	2502180	them go ahead be my guest you know i'm making a video criticizing them what i'm saying is if you
2502180	2506980	are criticizing them make sure you're taking the high road however if the martin boys's channel
2506980	2511540	does become integrated with the family of five brand more tightly people should then speak up
2511540	2516740	a bit more mike martin is a persistent bastard and he has created something through that persistence
2516740	2522100	he doesn't have much else going for him he knows that given his public reputation this might be all
2522100	2526660	he has left and he is resting on the shoulders of fans who he has convinced that he is the one who
2526660	2530980	has all the wrongdoing against him but those shoulders will not carry him forever and although
2530980	2535700	i would argue he has never had to fully face down the consequences of his actions i like to leave
2535700	2540740	you with a quote from native american author vine deloria jr from his book custard died for your
2540740	2545060	sins which by the way is an excellent read if you enjoy cultural discussion with a great dose of
2545060	2549540	sarcasm anyhow the quote that always stuck out to me since reading is the one at the end of chapter
2549540	2555860	four you see the wheel of karma grinds slowly but it does grind finally and it makes a complete
2556660	2560580	mike i'm sure the circle will be complete in the end
2564180	2568740	so yes that was the video probably one of my longer ones but there you go i would love to
2568740	2574100	hear your thoughts on the daddy 05 situation always open to a bit of discussion down below
2574100	2578420	really appreciate the support of recent pretty sure by the time this will be out probably be over
2578420	2585380	100 000 but you never know you never know we live and hope my friends oh my god wow
2585460	2590180	i'd love to give a big shout out to the editors who have once again done a stellar job i will
2590180	2595060	leave their channel links in the pinned comment go and check them out give them a subscribe they
2595060	2600020	really do deserve it videos would not be possible without them i'd also like to give a big shout out
2600020	2605860	to my patreon names up on screen right now and a special shout out to ryan who once again has
2605860	2610820	donated a hundred dollars generosity exceeds his beauty i'm sure i don't think i have too much
2610820	2614820	else to say i hope everyone's having a lovely day and i hope this has made their day a little
2614820	2619700	lovely even though the dark nature of the topic i hope i've managed to engage you until then
2619700	2628660	however i'm the right opinion and i will see you in the next one
2644820	2656660	so
