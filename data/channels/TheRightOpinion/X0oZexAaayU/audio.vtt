Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:08.960 --> 00:14.380
too much free time, and today we discuss a daddy that isn't Keemstar, what a shock.

00:14.380 --> 00:18.920
No today we shall be talking about the infamous Daddy05, to those who are unaware of this

00:18.920 --> 00:24.320
gent he is a family vlogger slash prankster, I use those terms very liberally, who found

00:24.320 --> 00:29.140
himself on the rocks a few years back, he was both shaken and stirred. Why? Well if

00:29.140 --> 00:33.540
you don't know you'll soon find out. Because my friends we are going back to a blast from

00:33.540 --> 00:37.620
the past, but we shall begin with a little anecdote as always, because I have actually

00:37.620 --> 00:43.060
made a video on Daddy05, although no one has ever seen it. You see as an artist, if that's

00:43.060 --> 00:47.160
what you can call my work at least, I have started, scripted and worked on many videos

00:47.160 --> 00:51.280
that will probably never see the light of day. That is the case for pretty much anyone

00:51.280 --> 00:56.060
in the creative industry, it's about running with a lot of ideas, some of which do not

00:56.060 --> 01:00.380
work, sometimes we realise these ideas don't work three lines into scripting them, sometimes

01:00.380 --> 01:04.500
we realise they don't work three years after you uploaded them, that is the life of the

01:04.500 --> 01:10.460
miserable creator. However the Daddy05 video was a classic case of changing circumstances,

01:10.460 --> 01:15.700
I had a video, uploaded it to YouTube, was ready to drop some very stinging criticism,

01:15.700 --> 01:19.580
had a big saucy thumbnail, and suddenly this video dropped.

01:38.620 --> 01:43.380
And I felt these circumstances had changed. The thing about Daddy05 is that it was a situation

01:43.380 --> 01:47.380
that greatly put his children in the spotlight, and regardless of whether they were sincere

01:47.380 --> 01:51.380
about this apology or not, I was not going to continue to drag them to something which

01:51.380 --> 01:55.740
they had shown a motivation to change philosophy in, there were children involved, and the

01:55.740 --> 02:00.980
apology video changed the context to the point where I no longer felt confident in my upload.

02:00.980 --> 02:05.700
Now that the dust is settled, hopefully firstly I can quell my allergic reaction, and secondly

02:05.700 --> 02:11.140
I can look into the situation and the legacy with fresh eyes. What was he apologising for?

02:11.220 --> 02:15.700
I'll explain the details very soon, but he was facing down a number of serious allegations

02:15.700 --> 02:20.180
and evidence that the creation of his content was being elicited through the abuse of his

02:20.180 --> 02:23.380
children, something not to be taken lightly at all.

02:41.140 --> 03:00.180
He

03:00.180 --> 03:04.420
was terminated by the YouTube gods for his transgressions, and likely because the media

03:04.420 --> 03:09.700
were picking up on it, and YouTube's relationship with the media is quite rocky, and no compromises

03:09.700 --> 03:15.140
can be taken when it comes to their reputation, to say the least, and we as human beings continued

03:15.140 --> 03:20.020
with our daily lives. So why bring it back now? Well for a few reasons, first one being

03:20.020 --> 03:24.820
some cheeky twats over on Twitter tagged me in a thread asking me to cover it, now I want

03:24.820 --> 03:29.460
to make this clear, I do not often take requests, but if there's enough meat on the bone I'll

03:29.460 --> 03:33.540
throw myself into the ring. The only reason I'm saying this is the last time I credited

03:33.540 --> 03:38.500
someone's request, I was bombarded with requests of the newest naughty YouTuber, and I only

03:38.500 --> 03:43.300
have so much time on this planet, I'm really sorry guys, I'm not saying don't send me

03:43.300 --> 03:47.620
spicy news on people, I'm just saying don't get your hopes up. So I was mulling on this

03:47.620 --> 03:52.420
for a while, and then I saw my Good Acquaintance Priminx video, which reignited my passion

03:52.420 --> 03:56.180
for the whole debacle, because although the barebones information was something that I

03:56.180 --> 04:00.580
was aware of, seeing someone expressing their opinion on it interested me further, and then

04:00.580 --> 04:04.980
the fact that Daddy05 threw a tantrum in response made me think that maybe there is a bit more

04:04.980 --> 04:09.060
to this story than we give it credit for, because the story in the headlines is that

04:09.060 --> 04:15.140
Daddy05 is back, back in what way? Has he had his channel restored? Well, not really,

04:15.140 --> 04:20.500
but you see Daddy05 never technically left, they were on YouTube until a few months back,

04:20.500 --> 04:24.980
when YouTube clearly probably decided that they'd had enough of that platform as well,

04:24.980 --> 04:29.460
and chucked them off, in which there was a very emotional video uploaded onto another channel,

04:29.460 --> 04:34.420
alas their tears fell upon the frosty heart of the viewer, but a few months later they

04:34.420 --> 04:39.620
are once again back, as Primink documents, but not exactly, you see their children now

04:39.620 --> 04:44.260
have a channel in which they create their own content that is owned by the grandparents,

04:44.260 --> 04:49.780
so Daddy05 claims to be not associated at all, the channel is known as the Martin Boys,

04:49.780 --> 04:54.180
which is comprised of the three remaining siblings, after the biological mother of Cody

04:54.180 --> 04:58.580
and Emma regained custody. There aren't too many indications of where this channel is going,

04:58.580 --> 05:02.820
or what exactly it's going to be about, but one can assume it won't be too sinister,

05:02.820 --> 05:06.580
given how I'm sure the Martin family are aware they're on thin ice.

05:06.580 --> 05:10.420
Nonetheless, it seems there are some questions about the ethics of this whole debacle,

05:10.420 --> 05:15.860
with Daddy05 positioning himself as a staunch defender of the lads rights to do what they want,

05:15.860 --> 05:20.420
while also decrying any association with it. This has opened a whole new debate

05:20.420 --> 05:24.580
about the morality of it, and frankly I find it all a bit messy.

05:24.580 --> 05:32.500
Everyone's saying, oh Daddy05 is back, Family05 is back, no, no I'm not, I don't own a YouTube

05:32.500 --> 05:38.820
channel, I have nothing to do with the Martin Boys YouTube channel, I do not own that channel,

05:38.820 --> 05:43.860
my name is not on that channel anywhere, nothing on that channel links back to me

05:44.420 --> 05:51.300
in any way shape or form, the Boys grandparents own that channel, they run that channel, and I

05:51.300 --> 05:58.500
have nothing to do with it, stop giving me shit about a channel that I don't have nothing to do

05:58.500 --> 06:03.380
with, I don't have access to it, I don't have anything to do with it, stop giving the Boys shit

06:03.940 --> 06:11.940
about their YouTube channel, I have nothing to do with it, it's not even mine, you're being stupid,

06:12.580 --> 06:26.660
I found that revisiting the whole topic has showed it to be incredibly appealing,

06:26.660 --> 06:31.620
and my plan will be to open a discussion on a multitude of Martin's actions and behaviours,

06:31.620 --> 06:36.740
particularly on how they rose to infamy, and how this rise can indicate a very simple longevity

06:36.740 --> 06:41.300
that will be detestable to most people, but irresistible to a select few that will keep

06:41.300 --> 06:46.340
their channel alive, equally I do not want this to be some simple analysis, because I do have a

06:46.340 --> 06:51.540
lot to say that I held off on the day, and a lot of these sentiments still ring true now, so expect

06:51.540 --> 06:56.740
a mix and match, today we're going to be discussing a lot, but you see to touch all bases you have to

06:56.740 --> 07:00.740
hit a home run, and that's what I plan to do, because out of all the topics that I've covered,

07:00.740 --> 07:05.620
I say this one has some of the most psychological discussions there are, so without further ado I

07:05.620 --> 07:10.500
suggest we dive into DaddyOFive and explain the numerous phenomena that drive such a situation

07:10.500 --> 07:16.100
that still has implications to this day, I cannot wait, and neither should you, let's get to it.

07:22.340 --> 07:28.020
Now, DaddyOFive's channel was set up in 2015, however as noted it has been terminated,

07:28.020 --> 07:33.940
so we rely on the remnants that history leaves us with to be able to make judgement of such content,

07:33.940 --> 07:38.580
nonetheless we don't necessarily need specific details of DaddyOFive's channel to understand

07:38.660 --> 07:43.940
everything that probably caused his channel to thrive, because 2015 was the year of the prank,

07:43.940 --> 07:48.180
now I'm not going to make up any bullshit and say that pranks were only big in 2015,

07:48.180 --> 07:53.220
they still exist to this day, many creators are still incredibly successful off the back of them,

07:53.220 --> 07:57.780
and there is no doubt in my mind that it will continue to thrive for years to come at least,

07:57.780 --> 08:03.860
however 2015 was the year that we had multiple controversies surrounding pranks, prank invasion,

08:03.860 --> 08:09.300
Sam Pepper, and so on, it was a huge year for the pranksters, and this is where we discuss the

08:09.300 --> 08:14.020
rise of the prank in the first place, the rise of the prank is a rather unsettling one, because

08:14.020 --> 08:18.660
there will always be an audience for these pranks, needless to say I am not a fan of them at all,

08:18.660 --> 08:23.940
but people love to see others in natural environments be fooled, while the audience

08:23.940 --> 08:29.300
are completely aware of it, it's that dynamic, equally the notion of a prank can often make

08:29.300 --> 08:35.060
creators conduct more extreme actions and excuse it under the notion of a prank, such as the

08:35.060 --> 08:40.740
multiple social experiments, of course as a defence this is valid to an extent, but it's also

08:40.740 --> 08:45.380
what creates the unique environment for pranks to thrive in, because you can't just stand around

08:45.380 --> 08:50.180
expecting those situations to happen naturally, a social experiment is, although certainly not

08:50.180 --> 08:54.500
conducted within the means of scientific reliability, an appropriate name for what many

08:54.500 --> 08:58.660
of these YouTubers do, they manipulate an environment and then expose the reaction of

08:58.660 --> 09:03.380
those in it, that is the trend that DaddyOFive appeared to jump on most enthusiastically,

09:03.380 --> 09:07.780
the prank, now the prank typically involves deceiving the participant, and many immediately

09:07.780 --> 09:13.300
would raise ethical claims, however sometimes deception is necessary to understand how humans

09:13.300 --> 09:18.180
act in certain situations, for example the Milgram experiment, I'm not going to go into

09:18.180 --> 09:23.140
details about it because it's fairly irrelevant, but it's a sobering study on the human condition,

09:23.140 --> 09:28.100
and a perfect example of how sometimes we need to deceive participants to get to the truth,

09:28.100 --> 09:32.820
and I'd recommend checking it out if you haven't, it wouldn't have been obtained otherwise.

09:32.820 --> 09:36.740
However, with the notion of a prank, the deception is what makes it entertaining,

09:36.740 --> 09:40.980
which once again in many situations is fine, particularly when considering that a majority

09:40.980 --> 09:45.540
of pranks slash social experiments were fake, and although we can definitely be annoyed at the

09:45.540 --> 09:49.460
people for faking them and misleading their audience, I'm glad that some of the direct

09:49.460 --> 09:53.620
shock that many of the subjects of their videos appear to endure wasn't actually real,

09:53.620 --> 09:57.620
because those situations, particularly ones where you have a bloody bomb thrown at your feet,

09:57.620 --> 10:03.140
can be pretty intense and raises significant ethical questions. DaddyOFive appeared to start

10:03.140 --> 10:08.100
off his channel in a fairly less extreme prank direction, with content that was stupid and

10:08.100 --> 10:13.060
idiotic but still that you could see might pass under YouTube's radar, however probably seeing

10:13.060 --> 10:19.220
the success in violence and seeing the audience response made them more motivated to become more

10:19.300 --> 10:24.580
hands-on. But why on earth would more people want to see something which is, without debate,

10:24.580 --> 10:29.620
much more aggressive and unpleasant? The thing is, revisiting DaddyOFive made

10:29.620 --> 10:34.260
me realise that there is a significant audience that never really cared about ethics, what a

10:34.260 --> 10:38.020
surprise. They didn't care about people's wellbeing, they're the sort of people who

10:38.020 --> 10:42.180
see a crime and pull out their iPhones and say they were just recording for evidence.

10:42.180 --> 10:46.740
The simple truth is, and there is no two ways about it, what made DaddyOFive so successful

10:46.740 --> 10:50.340
was that it doesn't matter whether they were branded as pranks or a joke,

10:50.340 --> 10:55.460
DaddyOFive provided the closest glimpse into the human reaction of a quote prank,

10:55.460 --> 10:59.620
because it is an up-close first-person perspective of something that you feel.

10:59.620 --> 11:04.180
And let me tell you, those emotions are very real, I was rewatching some of his Xbox pranks

11:04.180 --> 11:09.540
on a reupload channel, and I had to stop because I was crying, I was angry, I was enraged at how

11:09.540 --> 11:14.420
he treated Cody, and yet with a bit of emotional distance, that's what some people wanted,

11:14.420 --> 11:19.060
because that demographic existed. The realism is furthered once you acknowledge the fact that

11:19.060 --> 11:23.780
these people are children, and children are more likely to be emotionally volatile and react in

11:23.780 --> 11:28.260
such a way. People like chaos, people like volatility, everyone likes a prank where

11:28.260 --> 11:32.420
someone gets really angry, but whereas many pranksters were just plain actors,

11:32.420 --> 11:37.860
Mike Martin's channel had exhibits of the most raw aggression possible, and people ate it up.

11:37.860 --> 11:42.580
No one else did that, and no one else should do it, and most people couldn't do it. The emotional

11:42.580 --> 11:47.620
intimacy of having a situation like that would be impossible, how can you expose yourself to that

11:47.620 --> 11:51.940
level of suffering of your own children? But that's the thing, they weren't his own children,

11:51.940 --> 11:53.540
and this matters more than you think.

11:58.900 --> 12:03.460
Did you see this game when I sliced open his guts? I never felt so alive!

12:03.460 --> 12:05.620
Yeah, well you've been alive for like two minutes.

12:06.580 --> 12:10.580
While they do mess with the kids, a lot of the time it seems directed towards one specific kid,

12:10.580 --> 12:13.620
and that is Cody. While in the family video where they defended themselves, they said, you know,

12:13.620 --> 12:17.860
the kids get to decide if the video goes up, they also acknowledge that they have so much cool stuff

12:17.860 --> 12:21.620
thanks to having a YouTube channel. So by getting stuff, they're incentivized to allow the parents

12:21.620 --> 12:26.100
to upload these videos, even though the little kid Cody is very obviously not a fan of them.

12:26.100 --> 12:29.700
The youngest and the weakest and the most sensitive kid, Cody,

12:29.700 --> 12:33.700
is always nursing an injury, he's always covered in bruises. From video to video,

12:33.700 --> 12:36.740
there are signs of abuse all over his arms, his legs, his face.

12:37.300 --> 12:41.540
Generally there's a psychological phenomenon known as the Cinderella effect. Now I don't want to give

12:41.540 --> 12:45.940
too much credit to this theory, as I do not find the research on it to be the most reliable under

12:45.940 --> 12:50.740
closer scrutiny, but basically what it dictates is that step-parents are more likely to be abusive

12:50.740 --> 12:55.460
to their children than their biological parents. Now although I believe the impacts are overstated

12:55.460 --> 12:59.540
in certain circumstances, I do think there's a serious case to be made here of why certain

12:59.540 --> 13:03.780
children were such targets. This is an evolutionary theory, and Mike and Heather

13:03.780 --> 13:08.180
seem rather primitive to say the least. There seems to be this emotional distance. In the

13:08.180 --> 13:13.140
Drama Alert interview, Heather has this very unsettling way of referring to Cody as quote

13:13.140 --> 13:22.900
the boy. Interesting as she is the step-parent, once again, given the whole seedy nature of how

13:22.900 --> 13:27.940
they gain custody over him, it genuinely would not surprise me if that emotional distance from

13:27.940 --> 13:32.500
the adoption and subsequent alienation led to them being the greater targets of the abuse.

13:32.500 --> 13:37.140
On top of this, what would then happen is you'd see these very weird ways of justifying the abuse,

13:37.140 --> 13:41.380
which was probably both a technique for them and for their audience that somehow it wasn't

13:41.380 --> 13:46.420
their fault. After all, in many households, punitive measures are seen as fairly straightforward,

13:46.420 --> 13:51.060
even though this was clearly extreme, if you have someone who is punitively inclined, they see

13:51.060 --> 13:55.780
Heather and Mike talking these children down, it will fall into their sphere of perceptibility.

13:55.780 --> 13:59.620
I'll probably talk about this more in a future video than I have planned, but this is basically

13:59.620 --> 14:04.740
the psychological techniques that led to these children being treated differently in my opinion,

14:04.740 --> 14:09.540
and it seemed to yield from the fact that they didn't have that same connection, and the parents

14:09.540 --> 14:14.100
actively tried to neglect it, particularly in the mother's instance. When people made exposed

14:14.100 --> 14:18.500
videos on DaddyOFive, they rightfully highlighted the worst of his channel, but the thing is by

14:18.500 --> 14:22.980
ignoring the best of his channel, it gave them a get-out-of-jail-free card, the oh well you don't

14:22.980 --> 14:27.860
see the good side of DaddyOFive, there's a channel with a whole video dedicated to it, where they

14:27.860 --> 14:55.140
just play the emotional music, over the riveting clips, but really this was just another

14:55.140 --> 15:00.660
manipulation tactic to somehow once again create a moral delusion to justify the abuse, to try and

15:00.660 --> 15:06.100
make people think, oh I guess he was alright after it all. Happy times do not negate abusive

15:06.100 --> 15:10.740
or violent ones, that's like saying if Joe Blow punches his wife in the face, calls or slurs,

15:10.740 --> 15:15.540
but that's only like 5-10% of the time, the other 90% of the time it's just good, he's sweet,

15:15.540 --> 15:20.660
he cares, he apologizes, no the good times do not negate the abuse, that is a very important thing

15:20.660 --> 15:26.100
to know. The truth is you can't orchestrate the child's emotions in many of the videos,

15:26.100 --> 15:31.140
and then say, oh well he's happy in certain moments that somehow justifies it, I had many

15:31.140 --> 15:35.300
happy moments in my childhood, it doesn't change the terrible things that happened to me and the

15:35.300 --> 15:39.220
lasting effects they have to this day, and if the people who did those things were to come to my

15:39.220 --> 15:43.860
house with a box of chocolates and an apology, I'd appreciate it, but it wouldn't justify their

15:43.860 --> 15:48.980
actions. There is no prank, but people didn't care, and Mike clearly didn't care, he was

15:48.980 --> 15:54.500
extracting money out of that kid like an ATM, and exploiting that emotional distance so he felt no

15:54.500 --> 15:59.300
repercussions for his actions, and people watched it, after all, they're not responsible are they,

15:59.300 --> 16:03.940
they're just a single view, watching cruel and crazy videos on the internet, isn't that what

16:03.940 --> 16:08.500
people do? The thing is this isn't some third party testimony where you get to watch it on the

16:08.500 --> 16:13.460
news, some found footage, this was literally a person making money out of direct abuse and

16:13.460 --> 16:19.220
people let him reach 700,000 before others had to intervene. This is a situation like no other,

16:19.220 --> 16:23.300
and the fact that many people didn't have to experience the consequences directly of their

16:23.300 --> 16:27.460
actions meant they didn't feel responsible for whatever happened. On the other hand,

16:27.460 --> 16:32.660
you probably had a smaller but more dedicated fanbase of actual sadists who used the first

16:32.660 --> 16:37.460
person perspective that Mike often provided to live out violent fantasies that they themselves

16:37.460 --> 16:38.580
were not prepared to commit.

17:08.020 --> 17:11.140
uh all the kids need to gang up on jake at once

17:11.780 --> 17:19.140
tie him down and torture him king broton you're right why the hell is cody such a damn liar thief

17:19.140 --> 17:26.020
and evil nobody deserves his crap you did the right thing daddy five but this monster deserves

17:26.180 --> 17:26.580
this

17:37.380 --> 17:42.740
the internet is screwed everyone knows this and youtube is a target as much as anywhere else for

17:42.740 --> 17:47.460
these people to congregate and create their cruel little circles where they pose whatever fulfills

17:47.460 --> 17:52.260
their twisted desires i can't stop people from being inherently fucked up because some people

17:52.340 --> 17:56.660
always will be but what you can do is put the well-being of others first and know that if you

17:56.660 --> 18:01.940
were to enact your desires a lot of people would suffer and maybe reconsider your position on

18:01.940 --> 18:07.380
supporting such content essentially daddy o5's rise to the near top of the youtube totem pole

18:07.380 --> 18:11.860
was done through distorting a reality that made fans feel secure in their support of him whether

18:11.860 --> 18:16.500
it was through the emotional distance or through the tonal shifts that created an illusion and yet

18:16.500 --> 18:21.460
showed reality so raw that many people felt compelled to watch it's morally reprehensible

18:21.460 --> 18:26.820
but no one wanted to take responsibility equally by taking the ever popular notion of a prank

18:26.820 --> 18:32.100
and upping the realism to 11 he created something that without moral boundaries appeal to people

18:32.100 --> 18:37.140
which they then justified in their own heads with daddy o5 doing something no one else would really

18:37.140 --> 18:42.260
do and for good reason too the videos that mike made were absolutely appalling and there is no

18:42.260 --> 18:46.900
doubt in my mind that they had to be removed but by letting them fester for so long martin had

18:46.900 --> 18:51.860
created a fan base some of these fans left after mike was exposed whether it was for the moral

18:51.860 --> 18:56.980
epiphany or just the fact that he'd no longer be uploading his brilliant content is probably down

18:56.980 --> 19:01.780
to the individual but either way that was when the exodus occurred but as always there were

19:01.780 --> 19:06.900
many stragglers who stuck around for various reasons and daddy o5 pulled out all the stock

19:06.900 --> 19:24.020
to keep them on his side youtube had no option it doesn't matter if it was all taken out of context

19:24.020 --> 19:29.060
which it wasn't there was no way that they could let that sort of reputation gather on a site that

19:29.060 --> 19:33.940
was facing down tough times anymore i am for a free and open youtube but equally there was a

19:33.940 --> 19:39.060
line and the only use those videos should have been for was custody evidence you see the issue

19:39.060 --> 19:44.900
with daddy o5 is that he epitomizes the classic action consequence dynamic that helps drive many

19:44.900 --> 19:49.780
of the exiled individuals from the internet this is always the situation with the platforming and

19:49.780 --> 19:54.020
why it has been handled very sensitively when someone conducts themselves in a way in which

19:54.020 --> 19:58.820
some people may feel affects them they may act on what they decide to be justice the problem is the

19:58.820 --> 20:03.460
perception of justice is completely subject to the individual and when you take action against

20:03.540 --> 20:07.860
someone you'll always give them some sort of power to use that narrative and make themselves

20:07.860 --> 20:12.180
a victim does this mean you shouldn't take retributive action of course not you just have

20:12.180 --> 20:17.060
to work out how to make sure people can understand that in the context of the situation your listed

20:17.060 --> 20:22.100
justice was righteous and businesses often don't feel the need to do that after all people aren't

20:22.100 --> 20:26.580
entitled to an explanation and one thing that we've found is that every time youtube opens its

20:26.580 --> 20:32.340
mouth someone tends to get hurt equally however it does mean that those who you will remove have

20:32.340 --> 20:37.460
all the platform to scream and holler about it and so on daddy o5 provided content that no one

20:37.460 --> 20:42.660
else could which is why people firstly watched him and secondly tried to twist the content into

20:42.660 --> 20:47.700
a morally justifiable mold which meant that when daddy o5 decided that he was ready to play victim

20:47.700 --> 20:52.980
there was an army of fans ready to come to his aid so first came the original response video now

20:52.980 --> 20:58.660
people hated this video many people did rightfully so but equally it created a sect of intense daddy

20:58.820 --> 21:03.860
o5 loyalists through the narratives crafted titled false acquisitions another stunning

21:03.860 --> 21:08.180
display of martin's intellect he decides to respond to some of these claims but equally

21:08.180 --> 21:14.260
tries to keep the fans on board we're gonna make things right we're gonna make things right and i

21:14.260 --> 21:21.060
want everyone to feel comfortable and know that these kids are safe that this is all an act

21:21.060 --> 21:25.940
firstly it set up the precipice that his videos were fake normally this would be a compromise on

21:25.940 --> 21:30.660
the appeal of your channel's content but martin knew that he was on borrowed time as it was and

21:30.660 --> 21:34.980
couldn't continue his current brand anyway therefore in this instance claiming your videos

21:34.980 --> 21:40.820
are fake immediately plays into that narrative the reason why i say claiming rather than admitting is

21:40.820 --> 21:45.540
that it's such a tactical decision that i highly doubt they were fake and even if they were children

21:45.540 --> 21:50.180
like cody have no way to discern that and it's clear it caused a lot of genuine trauma therefore

21:50.180 --> 21:55.380
their defiance just really exposed how deceptive they were willing to be to maintain some semblance

21:55.380 --> 22:00.260
of audience stating that these videos were fake played credence into some people's minds and

22:00.260 --> 22:06.900
makes them feel better about supporting this madman uh cody is going to grow up to be an actor

22:06.900 --> 22:12.580
um i'm pretty sure of that which page in the script involved a stepbrother punching cody in

22:12.580 --> 22:16.500
the head he was being pinned on the ground and he got kicked in the crotch was that just kind of an

22:16.500 --> 22:22.180
ad lib thing are they method actors then they claim they put disclaimer that it was all just

22:22.180 --> 22:28.260
for entertainment purposes which just makes it all right i put in the video description for

22:28.260 --> 22:35.060
entertainment purposes early i categorize the videos as entertainment or comedy something that

22:35.060 --> 22:41.780
i know i've even used keywords a few times i use the word fake in the keywords and stuff a few times

22:41.780 --> 22:45.940
this is embarrassing but still it was a confirmation bias to people who wanted to

22:45.940 --> 22:50.820
hear that then they do the classic greg paul technique of reaffirming loyalty by branding

22:50.820 --> 22:57.060
them as real fans and praising the ones who stick with them after this i i we just wanted to make

22:57.060 --> 23:03.060
videos for you guys and we truly appreciate the love and support that you guys our real fans have

23:03.060 --> 23:09.380
given us over the last few days with everything that's going on and we're really sorry that we

23:09.380 --> 23:15.860
have to disappoint you and say that this immediately detaches them from the horrible

23:15.860 --> 23:21.300
mainstream moral normies and creates a reaffirmation of bond and pulls the dedicated

23:21.300 --> 23:26.820
viewer in it creates a moral burden remaining with these people and they look tired and forlorn

23:26.820 --> 23:31.700
they're the victims here guys can't you see all these false acquisitions have been weighing down

23:31.700 --> 23:36.740
with them brings a tear to my eye another really important narrative you'll see is him talking

23:36.740 --> 23:43.220
about the news once again the mainstream media is an easy target i mean i sure as hell don't like

23:43.220 --> 23:48.100
them a bunch of sensationalist cowards but it doesn't mean they're wrong all the time however

23:48.100 --> 23:52.420
the general distaste of the media allowed mike to move in and take advantage of it attacking the

23:52.420 --> 23:56.660
news and lumping any of his critics in with it as well it's also a power play attacking the

23:56.660 --> 24:01.300
mainstream media 99 percent of the time is going to come across as punching up and punching up

24:01.300 --> 24:05.220
makes you look more justified in your position because of some perceived institutional power

24:05.220 --> 24:09.540
they hold while name-dropping philip defranco for merely reporting it and setting his delightful

24:09.540 --> 24:14.420
fans on him it's clear that they didn't really know how to respond this is a peak victim narrative

24:14.420 --> 24:18.660
and once again it plays off that collateral dynamic that it's philip's fault for documenting

24:18.660 --> 24:23.140
this abuse rather than their fault for the abuse now they claim that the abuse is taken out of

24:23.140 --> 24:27.540
context they claim that the threats they've been receiving somehow makes defranco responsible as

24:27.540 --> 24:34.500
well it would have never got this out of hand if it wasn't for that defranco guy starting all of

24:34.500 --> 24:41.540
this doing all of this to my family he's responsible for this their voices are emotional they've been

24:41.540 --> 24:46.980
attacked someone get me a tissue i'm gonna gonna cry listen because defranco is a huge creator he

24:46.980 --> 24:51.460
has that clout to lead to such instance because you made provocative videos when working out how

24:51.460 --> 24:55.540
someone has contributed to your hatred you have to look at their presentation sometimes i've

24:55.540 --> 25:00.020
criticized people for making individuals out to be worse than they actually are however defranco

25:00.020 --> 25:04.740
just delivers a message on a situation that has been transpiring anyway the only difference was

25:04.740 --> 25:09.540
his size and many people were left to make their own judgment which they did when you behave in a

25:09.540 --> 25:14.100
way that instigates hatred upon yourself you have to be prepared to take it unless it comes from an

25:14.100 --> 25:18.740
exaggerated or false narrative defranco wasn't even the initial incident that caused this it

25:18.740 --> 25:23.780
was your ink prank he was merely publicizing it which he had every right to there was a range of

25:23.780 --> 25:28.260
anger some people saying this is outright abuse of your children others saying this is not abuse

25:28.260 --> 25:31.700
but these are asshole parents that are exploiting their children for money and hurting them

25:31.700 --> 25:35.540
emotionally and then it also appears that they have a dedicated audience that are completely

25:35.540 --> 25:41.780
fine with it crimey river bitches anyhow there's a lot of back and forth and anger and eventually

25:41.780 --> 25:46.580
the backlash from this video was felt people were angry and riled up and the walls were closing in

25:46.580 --> 25:58.900
on them

25:59.060 --> 26:11.220
oh

26:14.340 --> 26:18.980
this is where it becomes interesting because the family then puts out a more regretful video

26:18.980 --> 26:23.620
with the mum talking because although i'd say she's just as manipulative she's a bit more

26:23.620 --> 26:28.260
subtle chances are this was probably motivated by the threat of losing custody to cody which

26:28.260 --> 26:32.980
they subsequently did and there was a whole story behind this that had martin and his wife deceiving

26:32.980 --> 26:37.460
the authorities into having custody over the children mike martin daddy of five left back

26:37.460 --> 26:42.180
in 2008 when cody was one and emma was almost three my sister took care of those kids by herself

26:42.180 --> 26:46.260
with no money or help from him for almost seven years she gave him another chance and hunted him

26:46.260 --> 26:50.100
down to be a dad rose was a little overwhelmed and asked mike if he could visit while cody was

26:50.100 --> 26:54.580
visiting mike's wife forged paper saying my sister gave him custody of cody two years later after

26:54.580 --> 26:58.340
emma visited for thanksgiving they removed emma saying there was abuse that was unfounded we went

26:58.340 --> 27:01.780
to court and got a judge that was prejudiced against women with bipolar and wouldn't even

27:01.780 --> 27:05.060
look at our evidence that mike was unstable and abusive and gave him the kids in august

27:05.060 --> 27:08.740
a friend of ours came across their videos and told us about them we contacted the police

27:08.740 --> 27:12.580
immediately they did a report here and sent it to maryland which she included the document showing

27:12.580 --> 27:15.860
the redacted version because i don't want to share addresses and personal information and maryland

27:15.860 --> 27:19.220
told us it was corporal punishment they refused to do anything even though we talked to doctors

27:19.220 --> 27:23.140
and other professionals who say it is clearly abuse of all kinds we are just so worried who

27:23.140 --> 27:27.380
knows what kind of damage this is doing i can't confirm if every single detail of this is true or

27:27.380 --> 27:33.060
not but i consider it very plausible given the circumstances and with that publicly looming over

27:33.060 --> 27:37.460
them they no longer have their fans just to preach to this is the video that stopped me from putting

27:37.460 --> 27:41.860
out my video on them because i respected their children now i think for many the custody of cody

27:41.860 --> 27:47.060
and emma to their biological mother was a very satisfying ending to an emotional saga but it was

27:47.060 --> 27:52.820
just the start for the daddio five family to victimize themselves further look at what they've

27:52.820 --> 27:59.940
lost all for a few light-hearted pranks that got out of hand oh no the tragedy on top of this they

27:59.940 --> 28:04.020
were actually prosecuted for their treatment of their children and placed on probation a decision

28:04.020 --> 28:09.300
that i will probably respond to in a bit i mean let's be clear youtube made absolutely no mistake

28:09.300 --> 28:13.540
by booting them off the platform and every single one of the following repercussions were completely

28:13.540 --> 28:18.740
justified as well even if it was just pranks you can't expect social services to be happy with that

28:18.740 --> 28:23.300
especially following public uproar which once again good job on people for taking a stance

28:23.300 --> 28:27.540
and making the shitty legal system actually respond but at the same time with all the

28:27.540 --> 28:32.980
punishment mike positioned himself as a foolish man who didn't know better but now he has learned

28:32.980 --> 28:38.020
and doesn't deserve to be deprived any further and this was convincing enough for some people

28:38.020 --> 28:44.580
i just wanted to take care of everybody i just wanted you guys we wanted them to be happy we just

28:44.580 --> 28:49.140
wanted our kids to be happy and we went about it the wrong way the thing is youtube's biggest

28:49.140 --> 28:54.660
mistake was actually allowing daddy o5 to continue on the platform at all after losing custody of two

28:54.660 --> 28:59.060
of their children and once again giving them nothing much else to lose they rebranded to

28:59.060 --> 29:04.500
family o5 in which they continued many of their antics now of course the content was now watered

29:04.500 --> 29:08.020
down with some moments that are done with the conviction of tommy wiseau

29:28.340 --> 29:32.900
however there was still content that was angry and edgy enough to bring that audience back

29:34.500 --> 29:42.900
i'm trying to stop you from coming from the script

29:51.220 --> 29:56.020
with the new channel with the spotlight firmly off the family from the moment with it off daddy

29:56.020 --> 30:01.940
o3 he takes multiple breaks to talk about how hard done by he is in an excellent video by creator

30:01.940 --> 30:06.020
amanda the jedi she observes these exact techniques ones that would have been taken

30:06.020 --> 30:10.740
apart by larger creators if they were still on the other channel but now had a free place for

30:10.740 --> 30:16.100
their fans to feel sympathetic towards them they lost so much with nothing too much else to lose

30:16.100 --> 30:20.580
they knew they could milk what they had lost for the expense of very little else you'd think that

30:20.580 --> 30:23.940
maybe they'd apologize for the things that happened and that they were going to change

30:23.940 --> 30:29.940
and and make make things different make things more fun make it a genuine family fun friendly

30:29.940 --> 30:35.860
channel but no when mike comes back he complains what's up team do5

30:38.180 --> 30:47.220
oh man my wife has been driving me crazy has been driving me crazy about starting back up this

30:47.220 --> 30:52.020
gaming channel and even my therapist has been on me about starting this gaming channel they both

30:52.020 --> 30:57.060
think that it'll be really good for me to do this they think that it will help bounce me out

30:57.060 --> 31:04.740
of my depression and stuff like that i remember i used to be so happy that we were out of our

31:04.740 --> 31:22.260
bad neighborhood we were so happy everybody was happy as hell

31:27.380 --> 31:44.660
the camera this was a channel with approximately 300 000 subscribers videos that pulled views and

31:44.660 --> 31:49.540
it clearly wasn't as extreme but equally having that smudge on their reputation i really don't

31:49.540 --> 31:54.500
know why youtube would have tolerated it that long and it was still fairly intense and eventually

31:54.500 --> 31:58.740
they did respond to the fact that they were still uploading and the fact that policy wise

31:58.740 --> 32:03.780
they shouldn't really be able to and they kicked the family o5 channel too but by doing this they

32:03.780 --> 32:09.380
prolonged daddy o3's constant struggle against those horrible evil mainstream elites so in

32:09.380 --> 32:14.820
their tragedy they once again milked the situation by starting a passion i think they mean petition

32:14.820 --> 32:20.180
to bring back the poor persecuted daddy o5 there was also a video uploaded where the martin's

32:20.180 --> 32:24.820
sons basically power at the same talking points their father made times before they really are

32:24.820 --> 32:30.580
troopers and of course the sad piano music adds another delicious dimension just pulls on your

32:30.580 --> 32:42.740
heartstrings so we got shut down for nothing at the end of the day youtube terminated your channel

32:42.740 --> 32:46.420
once which gave you no right to have another channel and the fact that you were still allowed

32:46.420 --> 32:51.220
to operate on youtube for so long should have been considered a privilege oh and of course

32:51.220 --> 33:00.740
don't forget about those real fans and you all know you the real fans know how good of parents

33:00.740 --> 33:05.300
mom and dad are but this is the thing through this they had successfully emotionally appealed

33:05.300 --> 33:10.820
to a lot of audiences who were trying to confirm a biased conception of daddy o5 as the victim

33:10.820 --> 33:15.140
people who valued their own motivation for entertainment over the basic facts of the

33:15.140 --> 33:19.780
situation were more than happy to take this explanation the daddy o5 had been unfairly

33:19.780 --> 33:25.060
persecuted because it fit their world view and by having these kids deliver it in their quivering

33:25.060 --> 33:29.860
confused voice it was more than enough for many people to be satisfied the thing is that mike

33:29.860 --> 33:35.300
martin and to an extent his wife is the guy who punches the tiger and then complains when he has

33:35.300 --> 33:40.420
his arm bitten off but for every time he loses a limb he continued to irritate the situation

33:40.420 --> 33:47.140
just being more subtle every time oh guys i merely slapped the tiger uh uh guys i merely

33:47.140 --> 33:53.540
poked the tiger guys come on i merely tickled the tiger considering this is the same tiger the

33:53.540 --> 33:58.580
tiger isn't going to take chances and that first impression will rightfully stick with many people

33:58.580 --> 34:04.020
you don't get a blank slate when you do something as outwardly horrific as that and then try to hold

34:04.020 --> 34:09.220
onto the remnants as a brand and use it to play a victim card there will always be people who

34:09.220 --> 34:14.980
feel bad for the guy and call out the tiger to be put down how could such a savage animal bite off

34:14.980 --> 34:20.820
the arms of a poor helpless man daddy o5 positions himself as the underdog when really he received

34:20.820 --> 34:25.940
the repercussions that he asked for he is someone who baits these situations that can be seen with

34:25.940 --> 34:30.820
his behavior on youtube but eventually the bait will blur the lines of morality which is where

34:30.820 --> 34:36.420
we come to today's situation

34:53.220 --> 34:58.660
you see what i've shown here is how daddy o5 made the most of everything that happened against him

34:58.660 --> 35:03.140
even though many of us would agree that it is justified there will always be an audience who

35:03.140 --> 35:08.340
discard that narrative in favor of what they enjoy and every time he's continued to irritate the

35:08.340 --> 35:13.220
system and it has responded because they know his brand and they know what he likes he continues to

35:13.220 --> 35:18.820
cry about it and yes i believe people can completely change and that is reflected in a lot of my

35:18.820 --> 35:23.940
philosophy but what daddy o5 has done on this platform is so beyond redemption that he has to

35:23.940 --> 35:29.300
accept any consequences that come his way you can't bounce back from something like that from

35:29.300 --> 35:35.060
both a business and even morally oriented standpoint i'm gonna be honest i think mike got

35:35.060 --> 35:39.620
off lightly i think they were far too nice with him with the probation in my opinion he should

35:39.620 --> 35:44.580
have been sent to jail for what he did along with his wife especially to cody and he should be

35:44.580 --> 35:49.700
grateful that it's extremely difficult to fully evaluate and legislate against psychological

35:49.700 --> 35:54.580
trauma because if you go back and watch videos like nerd cities it's unbelievable levels of

35:54.580 --> 36:00.180
emotional torture that children like cody cannot process and then blaming it on him when he acts

36:00.180 --> 36:07.140
out is just unbelievable publicly creating this image that promoted a sick twisted mentality to

36:07.140 --> 36:14.100
punish him further i wish he would behave himself and act like normal child normal kids have bad

36:14.100 --> 36:23.460
behaviors cody has something else so up until now i have argued that most of the repercussions

36:23.460 --> 36:27.620
that occurred on the platform were completely warranted it must be noted that i never support

36:27.620 --> 36:31.620
threatening individuals and by doing so you give them an extra way to play victim as well

36:31.620 --> 36:36.740
though that is assuming all the events claimed by daddy o3 did actually happen but hey benefit of

36:36.740 --> 36:42.820
the doubt even for someone like him it's not necessary to the argument however with the latest

36:42.820 --> 36:47.620
move documented by some the lines become increasingly blurred basically the new youtube

36:47.620 --> 36:53.220
channel is dedicated to mike and heather martin's sons the martin boys and many people were claiming

36:53.220 --> 36:59.220
that daddy is heavily involved they've uploaded a few videos one in which they eat food good for

36:59.220 --> 37:03.460
them and many people are questioning whether they should be on the site and are criticizing them

37:03.460 --> 37:09.300
for having a platform and so on this has led daddy o3 to respond what you'll see is a classic

37:09.300 --> 37:13.700
situation but one where the lines are more blurred this time the sons have a channel and

37:13.700 --> 37:18.500
now daddy o5 is picking up that victim car and talking about all these people attacking him for

37:18.500 --> 37:23.460
having his sons on youtube he's private his account he's spoken about it on his twitch stream kids

37:23.460 --> 37:28.500
doing their youtube thing people are attacking them thinking it's my channel how stupid are they

37:30.180 --> 37:36.100
care about your kids so much let me attack them and have their channel shut down

37:36.100 --> 37:43.860
let me make a video talking shit about them and send hate over to them so i can get my views on

37:43.860 --> 37:51.060
my channel because i have no creative process and and the only way i could be creative is if i

37:51.060 --> 37:59.620
bully and you know just make someone else's life miserable fuck out of here man my heart breaks

37:59.620 --> 38:05.060
let the kids be kids and you know what i agree i don't think that the children although morally

38:05.060 --> 38:09.940
dubious in many of their actions complicit with their father should necessarily be prevented from

38:09.940 --> 38:15.060
ever operating a channel but what's been done here is that it struck the sweet spot between just

38:15.060 --> 38:20.100
and unjust they're still operating under the martin brand and they're still using the martin

38:20.100 --> 38:25.780
fan base however in my opinion they should be able to have a channel nonetheless people criticizing

38:25.780 --> 38:31.220
it is not a case to play victim because once again daddy o3 is tempting the tiger and that victim

38:31.220 --> 38:35.860
card is going to be used again and again to retain those fans who have convinced themselves

38:35.860 --> 38:40.820
that he is the one who has suffered undeservedly the martin boys themselves have promoted a brand

38:40.820 --> 38:45.380
and the brand website which we'll discuss in a moment if mike wants to detach himself from the

38:45.380 --> 38:49.940
channel he's doing it in the worst way possible but we all know he doesn't a lot of people think

38:49.940 --> 38:55.700
him responding is out of insecurity it's not just that it's a case of cultivating a fan base through

38:55.700 --> 39:00.500
their perceived notion of victimhood and trying to leave reality in the back of their mind daddy

39:00.500 --> 39:04.900
o5 is not a vick he has a twitch channel which does all right and he gives out stellar advice

39:04.900 --> 39:12.340
on curing depression as well best way to handle depression is to stop being depression

39:14.980 --> 39:15.940
the more you know

39:19.940 --> 39:24.260
because if you just stop being depressed you won't even be depressed no more

39:25.060 --> 39:31.140
and he has an instagram where he can post hell he has his own website the real antics are on

39:31.140 --> 39:36.020
his family of five domain which really is the only way to keep himself going now because as

39:36.020 --> 39:41.700
this title implies you can never get rid of daddy o5 as much as we detest who he is this is what

39:41.700 --> 39:46.740
has happened he has grown that fan base out of persecution and then taken them to a corner of

39:46.740 --> 39:51.620
the internet where he can cover them and provide them with videos for the very affordable cost of

39:51.620 --> 39:57.380
five dollars a month using that exact same persona to string them along about how he is the victim

39:57.380 --> 40:02.660
he has community posts where he's the victim he has tweets where he's the victim he has instagram

40:02.660 --> 40:17.380
videos where he is the victim this man the abuser he's the victim guys and if we paid five dollars

40:17.380 --> 40:22.500
to see that sweet daddy content we probably have videos where he's the victim too alongside him

40:22.500 --> 40:29.220
screaming at his kids and having the paywall immediately places a moral dilemma onto anyone

40:29.220 --> 40:34.180
who wants to continue criticizing their content do you pay five dollars and help support them and

40:34.180 --> 40:39.300
risk finding content that is nothing particularly to write home about or do you go leave it behind

40:39.300 --> 40:44.500
and risk possibly some very questionable stuff going on behind the scenes family o5 has it

40:44.500 --> 40:49.060
locked down for now and there's nothing anyone can really do about it he has taken advantage

40:49.060 --> 40:54.580
at every turn however i don't want it to seem like daddy o5 is some kind of mastermind because he

40:54.580 --> 40:58.980
isn't and i'm sure masterminds would be doing something much more with their lives he merely

40:58.980 --> 41:03.140
filled a gap in the market that is extremely morally questionable and they've worked out how

41:03.140 --> 41:08.180
to make people feel better about it and then using that entertainment to string along a load of sadists

41:08.180 --> 41:13.460
to engage in his content and support him through those tribulations i do not know how many fans he

41:13.460 --> 41:17.940
has right now but hopefully as time passes and the kids grow up the world will run dry

41:17.940 --> 41:23.060
just like with his first ever pranks he'll likely continue to push the boundary until someone hits

41:23.060 --> 41:28.660
back and then he can claim to be the victim again and start some fresh fresh drama which is why it's

41:28.660 --> 41:33.380
not worth attacking the martin boys personally let youtube decide what they want to do with it

41:33.380 --> 41:37.860
and try not to give mike any ammunition to cry about it i'm not saying you shouldn't criticize

41:37.860 --> 41:42.180
them go ahead be my guest you know i'm making a video criticizing them what i'm saying is if you

41:42.180 --> 41:46.980
are criticizing them make sure you're taking the high road however if the martin boys's channel

41:46.980 --> 41:51.540
does become integrated with the family of five brand more tightly people should then speak up

41:51.540 --> 41:56.740
a bit more mike martin is a persistent bastard and he has created something through that persistence

41:56.740 --> 42:02.100
he doesn't have much else going for him he knows that given his public reputation this might be all

42:02.100 --> 42:06.660
he has left and he is resting on the shoulders of fans who he has convinced that he is the one who

42:06.660 --> 42:10.980
has all the wrongdoing against him but those shoulders will not carry him forever and although

42:10.980 --> 42:15.700
i would argue he has never had to fully face down the consequences of his actions i like to leave

42:15.700 --> 42:20.740
you with a quote from native american author vine deloria jr from his book custard died for your

42:20.740 --> 42:25.060
sins which by the way is an excellent read if you enjoy cultural discussion with a great dose of

42:25.060 --> 42:29.540
sarcasm anyhow the quote that always stuck out to me since reading is the one at the end of chapter

42:29.540 --> 42:35.860
four you see the wheel of karma grinds slowly but it does grind finally and it makes a complete

42:36.660 --> 42:40.580
mike i'm sure the circle will be complete in the end

42:44.180 --> 42:48.740
so yes that was the video probably one of my longer ones but there you go i would love to

42:48.740 --> 42:54.100

42:54.100 --> 42:58.420
