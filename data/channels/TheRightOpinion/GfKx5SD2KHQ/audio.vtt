00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I said I'd do it, so here I am.

00:02.000 --> 00:11.000
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

00:11.000 --> 00:17.000
And today I follow through on something that I have been planning for the whole year, the Top 25 Best Songs of 2017.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
Now obviously this video isn't quite as objective as the title will imply, it's just the one that had the best ring to it.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
I accept that there are probably better songs in many regards, and I'll probably expand on that in the video at certain points.

00:27.000 --> 00:34.000
But these are the songs that I want to come back to, time and time again, because of some special quality not held in other songs throughout this year.

00:34.000 --> 00:42.000
2017 itself was a weird year, a lot of mainstream pop became very bland, so I ended up in this weird, hybrid, alt music genre a lot of the time.

00:42.000 --> 00:49.000
There was a lot of great music this year, and I want to emphasise that, and a lot of songs were very painful to cut because of their fantastic quality.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
However, I had to make a decision to get 25 top quality songs out.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
However, before we do that, let's look at what the music reviewers call the honourable mentions.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
Hey, hey, so won't you open up the sunroof, yeah

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Let you go

01:57.000 --> 02:06.000
Because I'm 18, and I still live with my parents, yeah they're not like yours, well yours I'm understanding

02:06.000 --> 02:16.000
You hang in line, you find it hard to define, but you do it all the time, when you do it again, looking for signs of light

02:16.000 --> 02:25.000
Run around on me, oh my god, take me slow, get it fast, go

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
Now, when I started compiling this list, I originally intended it to cover the top 20.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
However, that plan had to change when I realised that there were some songs just below 20 that did deserve more in-depth analysis.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
This wasn't one of them, but I'm still glad it's here.

02:50.000 --> 02:59.000
I'm facing my faults, overcoming my addictions, talking out loud, when I'm talking about love

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
I heard this one and sunroof back when I was entering the summer and I realised they were both really good pop rock songs

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
But I wasn't sure which one would edge it long term, this one did.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
The bright guitar riffs with the pre-chorus before it kicks in with the bass on the first verse

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
As this loser sings about how his life is completely fucked with the chorus being this pop drop

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
Which is more likeable than it has any right to be, the buzzing bass synths on the second verse, the rhythmic bridge

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
All encompassed by this sheer desperation just to make for this really actually enjoyable listen

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
It's a song about losing your wits, but it has so much fun with it that it is just impossible to ignore

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
And that's why this one is at 25. Love it.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
This song is a bit of an outcast from the other ones on the list, it has quite a dry sound

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
And when I started going over my year end favourites I didn't really consider it

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
But listen after listen, I realised it was pretty fucking great

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
Liam Gallagher brings this A game on the song which is essentially a diss track to people who always want more than they can have

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
By hook or by crook

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
Firstly the drum work is fantastic, it's pulsating, it drives a great groove with fantastic blending between acoustic and electric guitar

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
Before this massive chorus jumps in as he tells this twat that he has the Midas touch

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
And this is the thing, Liam Gallagher sells it, if anyone doesn't give a fuck it is Liam Gallagher

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Which makes this song even more glorious

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
And this beautiful beautiful part towards the end with the horns and this conglomerate of guitars everywhere

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
It really is special, it's a song that goes places and knows how to use Liam Gallagher

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
He is gonna get this person and even I'm a bit scared

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
I don't mind Post Malone, I think he's a pretty great guy all round, he makes some decent songs

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
But if you told me I'd be including him in a year end list, yeah, sure mate

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Probably would have chuckled

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
I mean this song isn't necessarily his song, it's a feature, but it counts enough

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Counts enough

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
Ok so first things first, any song that uses a sliding chord structure sounds pretty fucking cool

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
With this smokey bass line that just eats up the song

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
Post Malone and Watts vocals couldn't be a better combination as they are both massive warblers

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
And it really does complement a beat like this

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
I love the melodic direction as well, there's variation in vocal delivery with every single line

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
It gives it a very unique personality

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
This is also reflected in the instrumental

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
Which varies impressively despite its seemingly limited range of inputs

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Before launching into this fantastic guitar solo

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
And one that we definitely need a bit more of

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I haven't spoken about the lyrics because there's not too much to say

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
They're kicking ass and hey ho, who needs deep shit when you're kicking ass

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
There are a few songs that are definitely better than their brand

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Once again that's mainly because this video is quite personal to me

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
With that said it doesn't mean that songs can't be appreciated for their craftsmanship

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
And this next one is definitely an example of that

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
This song is an instrumental masterpiece

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Really integrating a lot of the oriental inspiration for this song

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
With very glossy yet fleshed out synthesizers

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
With this shimmering piano and smooth backing vocals

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
And intermittent guitar work all composed together so well

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
It really lends for a particularly lingering atmosphere

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
There's this constant state of musical evolution throughout this five minutes

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
Going over musical bridges and transitions and so much more

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
It's really quite beautiful

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
The song itself is about envy and how the artist would love to have the clout to tour the world

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
It's a personal message, maybe one that doesn't quite resonate with me

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Or with the mood of the song

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
But I can still admire it nonetheless

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
As number 22 proved, I do place emphasis on a song's instrumental work

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
I still prefer a complete piece even if some parts may be weaker on an individual basis

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
As contrast, number 21 proves incredibly strong in all categories

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Hence why it's just above Tokyo

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
I mean, let's get something clear here

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
The instrumental work is still fantastic

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
You can never have too many guitar tones

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
But the mood of this is much deeper

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Maybe too deep for some

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
As he cryptically and desperately searches for meanings and roots to his aforementioned pain

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
It is brooding, it is thoughtful

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
And it's interwoven with beautiful guitar work

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
It's all here

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
I think I counted at least three different guitar solos

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
The song just lets you slip away to it

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Without revealing too much

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
It may not be a tearjoker

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
But it is one that just stops you

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
And leaves you in a very contemplative mood

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
And for that, it's really quite special

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
So, now the top 20, the tracks that we're always gonna beat here

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
This next track demonstrates how I value emotional resonance

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
As an important factor to how I enjoy a song

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Arguably not as complex as the previous songs

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
But one that still touches me

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Nonetheless

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Ignore the part 2

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
They're both the same, just one without Kiara

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Though Kiara is what makes the difference in this instance

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
The original wouldn't have made it

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
By providing a second perspective

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
It lends the song to significantly more depth

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Than it has any right to have

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
And gives us this tone about two lovers

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Reminiscing about their previous times together

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
And despite the track intimacy that it provides

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
You feel that they're not really talking face to face

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Juxtaposing the lyrical symmetry

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
With the contemplation that they may never reunite

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
And that's a very bittersweet tone

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
The song's composition, which is this soft synth guitar mix

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Really knows how to supplement the mood with that post-chorus drop

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Almost being this catharsis of emotion that both these people feel

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I don't know if it's what they went for

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
But it worked

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
So, props to them

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Most of these songs aren't ones that have been released in the last month

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Because normally I need some time to let them sink in

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
At the time of writing, this one was released in the last month

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Because as soon as I heard it, I knew it was making my list

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
One way or another

09:04.000 --> 09:19.000
This song perfectly encapsulates the euphoria in an admittedly slightly unhealthy obsession

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
But in a way, I think Gardner understands that

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
As these cascading synths and drums collapse around his quirky vocals

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
You feel the joy and the turmoil of having feelings for someone

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
There's that sentiment that the recipient of this love

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
May never even be aware of themselves

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
The desperation with lyrics such as

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
But there's nothing else I can do

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
And comparing this person to factors such as religion show that he is locked

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
As the synths fade away for one more percussive pre-chorus

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
You feel his vocals bare and honest as they come

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
As he lays everything down one more time

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Some may say the overuse of the line

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
I can't stop thinking about you is annoying

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
And I understand that

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
However for me it's quite masterful because it perfectly reflects the tone and the lyrics in a way

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Making it catches all hell as well

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
And pretty damn great

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
I had a great year with some excellent albums from rappers who I hadn't paid too much of mind in the past

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Given the proportion of music that I listened to

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
You won't find too much rap in these lists

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
But when you do find it, you know it's good

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
A lot of people have been putting Temptation on the list

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
And yes, that's definitely another fantastic song

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
But I rooted for this one when it came down to The Wire

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
And there are a few reasons for that

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
Firstly, the production on this song is simply fabulous

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
And it's not a style that I've heard too often as well

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Then you have the lyrics

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
And it's not about the content itself, but it's the delivery

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Joey has moments towards the end of the second verse

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
Where you feel like he is wearing his heart on his sleeve

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
And we don't hear that enough in music

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
It's all so distant, yet here he's selling his emotions to us

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
I feel like he is close to crying

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
And that is powerful in my mind

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
What finally pushes this song over the top

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
Is the outro that feels like it was inserted to give the audience that moment for contemplation

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
And I used every second

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
It's a song that I fully appreciate

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Some songs are just anthems

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
And we need more anthems

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
On the first listen, I did not add this song to my favourites

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Heaven knows why

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
But it's a hell of a good thing I came back to it

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
This is a song that is just required in a year of such depressing mainstream radio

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
I have a respect for music that can make the normal sound incredible

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
This song is about doing fuck all with a takeaway

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
And the one you love

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
But the lead sells it

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Partly thanks to the focus being more on togetherness

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
But also due to the incredible instrumentation and melodic work

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Multiple guitar tones, harmonies

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
With the sheer pounding elation of a soaring chorus

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
So desperately yearned for this year

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
The Amazons did a fantastic job

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
And this was not their only song that I absolutely loved this year

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
However this one was the best of the bunch

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
With its unique topic and sensational delivery

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
There is simply not much more that can be said

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
Often there are a few songs that get lost in rotation throughout the year

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
But upon re-listen, find themselves gradually moved up the list

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Until they hit a new high

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
This is a song that I had written off out of all the songs here

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
And yet when I came back to it

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
I realised that it was actually a priceless slice of musical gold

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
On the air shouting out that you're ready to change

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Ready to change

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
You can say what you want

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
The song opens with the vocalist cooing with real contempt

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
As tender but menacing pianos grow into this huge chorus

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
With propulsive hand claps and building drums

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
Before throwing itself into this guitar and vocal driven drop

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
With the piano hanging over the mix

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Once again there's a real evolution

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Each chorus is unique

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
Really giving a feeling of progress and building on the emotion

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
How many songs this year have just fucking died halfway through

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Or pulled away from a large chorus

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
This song pulls no punches

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
To sum up, this song is about someone who is a bit of a cunt

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
But fucking hell, Kodaline frame it like they're bloody evil

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
And I thought Liam Gallagher was brutal

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
But the lead singer sounds legitimately angry

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
And to be honest, if this was directed at me, I would not recover

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Fantastic track, check it out

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
Sometimes there is a song that has no right to be as good as it is

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
That despite its simple and humble beginnings

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Everything has just fallen into place

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
This is one of those

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
Let me tell you who I am

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
I'm your biggest fan

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
Got your picture on my phone

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
I got tickets to your show

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Girl let me tell you

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
This song is about someone who is using a very unique technique to pick up a girl

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
To the point of sounding slightly creepy to be honest

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
It shouldn't work well, but it does

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
And there is a reason for that

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Will Joseph Cook, he sells it

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
He is such a charismatic vocalist

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
Effortlessly conveying the sentiment of dizzying infatuation

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
You feel that it's out of an adorable naivety

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Rather than anything sinister thanks to that

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
This mood is only furthered by the infectious guitarist

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
That has sprinkled all over the song

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Some more acoustic, others more electric

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Yet they blend together so fluently

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
All of this combined makes for a truly joyous song

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
And one of the best of the year

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Great work Will, keep it up

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
I think out of all the choices on this list

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
This is the corniest choice

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
In a year of rap geniuses such as

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Joyner Lucas, Kendrick Lamar, and Ty the Creator

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Gracing us with their presence

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Including this guy and not those

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Seems a bit of an insult

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
But although I accept that they have made

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Objectively better songs, this is my list

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
But still

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
I just wanna be free

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Not a slave to the stereotype

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
All alone in my room in the middle of the night

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
I don't have the words but my stereo mic

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
I don't wanna be black, I don't wanna be white

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
I just wanna be a man today

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
I don't wanna be a

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Yes, I'm aware that Logic mentions

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
He's biracial too much

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Yes, I'm aware the song has this weird

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Slowed down outro

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
And yes, I'm aware the lyrics are corny as hell

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
But I just can't help myself

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
I love this song

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
From the bright piano keys to

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Damien Lamar Hudson's beautiful vocal

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Performance over an interlude where he just

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Belts his lungs out

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
It's a song that lifts me up

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
And as I said, the lyrics are corny

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
But at least they promote a positive message for once

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
A message where you can be proud of your achievements

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Regardless of the qualities on face value

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
In a year swamped in negativity

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
And stereotypes

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
This was actually kinda necessary and meaningful

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
To me

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
And the fact that Logic can take a personal story

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
And speak to the masses with it

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Is quite special in itself

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
And looking in the comment section of the YouTube video

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
It clearly reaches a lot of people

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I'm gonna defend its choice here

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
Even though I accept that there may be other better ones

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Some songs are on this list because they're evocative

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Other songs are just too well made to ignore

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
However, this is one song that I can't really decide

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Which build that fits

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Maybe both

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
I could rain

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
Come and let me walk away

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
I won't look back

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Geowolf made a masterpiece

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
This song's sweeping tone

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Leaves me in the same

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Contemplated mood every time

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
The soft electric guitars blending effortlessly

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
With this excellent synth

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Which grow into the first verse

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
As the singer searches for a love among

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Before blooming into this beautiful chorus

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
Where all the previous components come into play

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
And she confronts her love and his indecision

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
With these shimmering synths in the second verse

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
And this monumental bridge

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Where she realises that she might have found some closure

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
The production is undeniable in helping that

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
And the lead singer could not be better suited to that production

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
Her airy vocals floating over the mix

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Bathing in it without drowning in it

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
This song really is spotless

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
Albeit a bit alien to me

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Amazing

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Keep it up

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
Every year I'll find out about one or two artists

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
That I think deserve to be the next big thing

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
This year there was only one of those

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
Whose music I really consistently enjoyed

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
And it was only right that he be included in this list

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
Because there were plenty more songs of his to choose from

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
Cause I believe in Karma

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
And you believe in Karma

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
You should try a little harder

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Oh Karma's gonna fall

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
As the stiff acoustic guitar line kicks in

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Over some very dry drum work

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Tom Walker sings aggravatively

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
About this naughty wench who's fucking around with him

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
And as the pre-chorus creeps in

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
This swell of synths around you

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
And you feel like something is going to happen

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
At a lot of points this year, nothing happens

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
It just does this disappointing drop

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
And you're left feeling like a fucking wet flannel

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
And yet with Tom Walker, you get that payoff

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
You get that massive chorus

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
And it's so refreshing because Tom Walker has managed to understand the art of the climax

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
With all the instruments synchronizing perfectly behind Walker's voice in this chorus

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
To give it real gravitas

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Too many vocals have backed away from the chorus this year

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Walker is no coward

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
The foreboding premise of Karma itself is pretty ingenious

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
And definitely aids the very sinister tone

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
And that final breakdown where Walker just lets loose on this girl

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
I'd just be as scared as her at that point

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
You don't really know exactly what Walker's promising you

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
But that ambiguity plays into the particularly uneasy aura

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
Menacing and brilliant truly masterful aspect of the song

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Truly fucking great, thank you for this

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
Last year I placed my hood at the top of the year end list

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
It was a song that spoke from personal perspective

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Yet appealed to a general audience

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
And that sort of juxtaposition of detail and universality always rivets me

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
Particularly if the message is one that resonates

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
This year, that artist Ray BLK didn't quite hit those highs

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
But with the help of upcoming singer Dan Kaplan

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
She found her way back onto the list

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
Living by the numbers cause you and me

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
Go through it like the others

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
And the highs don't feel the same

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
And you still get drunk and flushed as rain

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
As I've said earlier this video

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
A song about mediocrities of life being made surprisingly pleasurable

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
Is always appealing to someone like myself

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
As the hollow synths buzz in the background

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
Kaplan's frothy baritone reflects on the unhealthy but gratifying lifestyle

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
That he and Ray BLK lead

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
As the stiff piano kicks in on the chorus

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
We hit that sour high that Kaplan is trying to project

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
The dysfunctional exhilaration

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
Ray BLK fits perfectly to play that partner in crime

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
With the tender harmony on the second chorus

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
But let's face it

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
The reason that song is here

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Is because of the bridge

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
That fucking bridge

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
As the synths and piano mesh together

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
In this apocalyptic, alcoholic, infused chaos

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
You realise that the protagonist

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
May never escape that state that they are in

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
You feel the joy in the euphoria

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
As it all falls down around them

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
And as the beat drops out

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
You feel yourself drowning with them

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Before that final chorus

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
That is just the best culmination of the previous components

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
It's a great slice of contemporary music

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
And more than enough reason

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
That the song finds itself here

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
Halsey, an artist I never really got into

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
And I'm not sure I ever truly will

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
But on our last album

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
There was one song called Roman Holiday

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Which was simply sensational

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
And it demonstrated a level of introspection

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Not shown in a lot of modern pop cuts

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
I don't know if she'll ever hit that high again

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
And her latest album left me fairly indifferent

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
But damn, when she strikes gold

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
She strikes gold

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
Said that we're not lovers

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
We're just strangers

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
With the same damn hunger

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Strangers is a hollow, hollow song

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
But from the industrial drum to the creeping synths

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
It really creates a brooding atmosphere of mystique

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Which is well suited to this tune, must I add

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
The chorus itself is like a controlled explosion

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
It grows so much but stays so tight

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
With these Roman choir vocals dripping through the back of the mix

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
It engulfs the listener

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Lauren Jauregui does a fantastic guest performance

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Adding a very nice tinge of soul to her part

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
And the harmonisation on the choruses

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Create moments to behold

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
The context about the attempts to move on from a relationship

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
And the passion that drives it

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Dealing with separation from something that's not working out

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
But still having to live with feelings that linger

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
It's a simple message but very powerfully done

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
And the two person perspective definitely aids that

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
Preventing it from sounding petty or creepy

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Fantastic song, check it out

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
There was a cut off this year

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
For songs that really emotionally moved me

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
These top 9 songs enter that new tier

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
A tier of emotional resonance for me personally

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
Songs that I could sit down to and emote over

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
This next song is the only massive hit on the list

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
And whereas many mainstream songs could wear out their welcome due to overplay

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
This one never got old

21:51.000 --> 21:57.000
And I miss the way you make me feel

21:57.000 --> 22:02.000
It's real when we watch the sunset

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
Over the castle only

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Castle on the Hill opens with soft guitar tones

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
As Ed Sheeran's voice reminisces over the energetic but slightly reserved beat

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
As the drums and haunting vocals kick in on the pre-chorus

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
You feel the memories slowly returning

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
And then what makes this song? The chorus

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
This truly euphoric moment

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
Suddenly that soft guitar tone becomes the peak of a soaring mix

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
That captures so much raw emotion

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
With Ed putting in one of his greatest vocal performances to date

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
The joy and the pain

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
And all these powerful emotions that seem to desert some of us into adulthood

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
There is a uniqueness in being young

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
And the individual moments that we'll probably never be able to relive

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
And Ed Sheeran understands that

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
And then there's the bridge

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
And the fucking bridge man

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Where there is this confrontation with the present

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
And the moment that not everyone has fully realised what they want to be

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
That bittersweet moment is a borderline tearjerk for me

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
The framing is something special

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
And although Ed Sheeran surprised me by selecting this as a single

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
It was the best surprise possible

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Fantastic

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
I've never really rated All Time Low too much

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
They have had some very good songs

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
But a lot of their music doesn't leave a huge impact on me

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Not bad by any means

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
But I wouldn't expect it to be putting it on my best list

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
So you know what this means

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
A contradiction

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
In many ways it makes sense to have this and cast on the hill back to back

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
Because they are very similar in this sentiment

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
The mature singer reflecting on the days when they had that youth

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
The wish to return to better days

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
I feel this song goes one step further than the previous

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Delving into the emotional psyche of the lead singer

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
Addressing feelings of losing someone dear to you

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Denial a regret that you can't return to that time

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
And then the resolve to accept that you have to grow up

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
The memories that you had with that person

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Trying to tell yourself it was never going to work out

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
But still considering the possibilities if it did

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
The final line of the song alters the auxiliary verb for one final twist

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
And it's a nice little touch

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
The production and melody is a real step up

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Really building up to this emotional high on the chorus

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
With this propulsive blend of guitar tones

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
With these liquid drums really pinning down a mix

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
That could have been too loose

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
The melody really lets the vocalist lay bare his feelings

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
While still retaining a lot of all time lows personality

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
That made them popular with the fans in the first place

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
It's a song that finds maturity and age

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
But still finds themselves in a lot of the roots that they base themselves in

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
It really disappoints me when I find an artist

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Who barely any viewers have heard of

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
And for me it's so objectively clear how great they are

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
That I have to share

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
And so with this next song it is one of those moments

24:41.000 --> 24:47.000
Princess in a castle you're a diva

24:47.000 --> 24:52.000
Everybody said that I should leave you

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Mood swing back in

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Sony's Princess tells us the simple story

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
About an entitled female who is draining Sony's mental

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
And maybe even physical resources

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
The song opens with these delicate drums

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
And delicious layered vocals

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
With guitar work that would make angels cry

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Sony's melodic composition is on point

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
As he delivers intonations and inflections with ease

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
And then the chorus just slides in

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
With all these components put together

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
And there are just these nice little tweaks

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
That could have been left out

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
But yet he chooses to insert

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
And they enhance the mix so much more

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
The drum dropout at the start of the second verse

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
The organ line in the second chorus

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
And the solo guitar that is just laced throughout the whole song

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
But really the cherry on the cake is Sony himself

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Who has an unassailable vocal presence

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
It's really the performance of the year

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
There is no questioning that in my opinion

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
He had a heavy lumbering mix on the song

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
And yet pulled it off with this beautiful performance

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
So complete credit to him

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
This is a great song and he made it happen

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
When writing up the shortlist for this

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
I realised that I didn't have any grime songs

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
It wasn't that there aren't any good ones out there

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
They just didn't make the cut this year

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
I like my grime

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Last year I had Holy Grime by WALL-E

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
And This Is England by Kano in my top 20

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
So in an attempt to see if I had missed any at all

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
I listened once more to a few grime albums

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
I didn't quite find a grime song

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
But I did find something

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
I don't think I ever considered myself to be including a religious song

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
Friends know that I'm fairly cynical towards religion

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
But unlike a lot of tunes this doesn't speak down to the listener

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
You feel like Stormzy is standing right beside you as he presents this

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
And it fortunately leans more on the spiritual side without being preachy

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
He is thanking God but I honestly couldn't care

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
He just sounds so grateful, so likeable, so genuine

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
It reaches out to anyone who hopes they can be lifted up with or without celestial means

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
The organ swell, the touch of the guitar

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
And Jesus Christ, MNEK's vocalisation and harmonies are unbelievable

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
He is on a completely different level in this song

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
And I'll tell you this much, the idea of God may not be one that I have in my heart

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
But the idea of thankfulness, for the support when all seems lost

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
Yeah I feel that, so thank you Stormzy for this song

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
So when Tom Walker released Karma earlier this year

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
I thought to myself, what a great tune

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
This is easily his best all year

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
Tom Walker, not to be outdone, decided to release another song

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
And fucking hell

27:30.000 --> 27:36.000
I will leave the light on

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
It's crazy that we have to rely on indie artists for the best drops these days

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
The chiming synths hit like a ton of bricks

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
As Tom Walker roars with passion that no man can match

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
The song itself is essentially an open letter to a friend

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
Who is going through a hard time and turning to drug abuse

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
It's a dark topic but like the lighthouse that Tom Walker has set up

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
There is still a shred of hope

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
The soft piano building on the chorus is sentimental and potent

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
And the bridge where you feel that desperation in his voice and lyrics building

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
That he knows that his friend is in danger but he still refuses to give up

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
The determination of that is brilliant

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
The sheer belief and faith in Walker's delivery is truly outstanding

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
It sounds like he's been there and he sells it like he has

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
And I would say more but I don't know what to say

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
You just have to check it out for yourself

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
It is sensational

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
I love it when a band can take elements of the old and integrate them with the new

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
That's what Def Havana did this year

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
And I give them a lot of credit for it

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
They really transformed music to me

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
But to go one step beyond and make a damn masterpiece

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
They didn't have to but they fucking did

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
When my lungs collapse and my heart turns black

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
I'll bring my ashes to the cold

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
When actually writing this script I was listening to the songs

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
To make sure that I was getting all the points down

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
And this is where the emotions really did get the better of me

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
But I think I can keep it composed without the musical accompaniment here

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
In this song the lead vocalist deals with issues of isolation, depression, separation

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
And returning to the places of foregone memories to try and cleanse yourself of those feelings

29:11.000 --> 29:16.000
The lyrics utilise anecdotes and metaphors to tell a story with incredible poetic depth

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
The singer goes through these issues systematically in the verses

29:19.000 --> 29:25.000
Utilising an acoustic guitar before exploding into a huge chorus with bittersweet emotional highs

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
It is a moment of real musical transcendence

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
The piano bridge after the first verse is a great touch as well

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
And just when I thought I couldn't top all these swelling emotions

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
The bridge comes in and he confronts what he has lost as he sings

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
If I could find the legs to stand on or something

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Maybe I could take control of my own life

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
You realise that he may never get that closure that he yearns for

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
Because he hasn't truly realised a problem

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
And then it just launches into this huge instrumental break

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
That just tries me every time

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
This song is brilliant

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
There's nothing more to be said

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
John Mayer

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
I don't know what the fuck happened

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
He's here

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
And what about this feeling

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
That I'm never good enough

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
Will it wash out in the water

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
Or is it always in the blood

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
Yes, John Mayer is an incredibly talented person

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
But his music never really had much of an effect on me

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
That was until mid 2017 when I heard this cut and dam

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
In this song, Mayer addresses a lot of his insecurities

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
And poses the ever important question of nature or nurture

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
The interesting thing is that a lot of his questions don't have clear answers

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
Are a lot of the feelings we have innate or can we circumvent them for the better of our health

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
This framing is particularly important

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
As it's quite rare that we have an artist frame himself with that much equivocation

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
In a way enacting a double blind because he's not even truly aware of the answer himself

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
All of this presented over some of the best production work in his career

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Originating with the acoustic guitar

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
The slow introduction of more and more guitars throughout the mix

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Is such a fantastic touch

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
It takes it in new directions every time

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
And all topped off with an appropriately soft

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
But an appropriately beautifully breezy guitar solo

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Which just elevates the song more and more

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
It is easy going, it is John Mayer

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
But it's still emotionally very resonant

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Honestly it is a brilliant tune

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
And I am so happy that it's here

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
And I'm so happy that John Mayer made it happen

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
Lorde had a commercially disappointing year

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
But it didn't prevent her from putting out a pretty damn great album

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
Now a lot of critics chose to insert Greenlight or Liability

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Which are very strong songs as well

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
But I had to go for something a bit more personal

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
The song Perfect Places is about emotional catharsis

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
Through partying, alcohol and dubious substances

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
As emotional highs are becoming harder to find

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
She searches more and more desperately

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Romantic things like kissing and taking off clothes

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Are resigned to be mere functions

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
As the hollow drums pound in the background

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
And we reach the final outro with Lorde questioning the existence

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
Of these Perfect Places over these monumental synthesizer tones

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
We realise that Lorde has come full circle

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
And that everywhere she searches for those Perfect Places

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
All of the new highs lose their novelty

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
And no longer fulfil what was desired

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
That is one powerful message

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
The synth swell and melodic delivery in the chorus

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
Really highlight the double edged sword of the message

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
You feel the joy but you also feel a lot of the turmoil

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
The slight push on Lorde's vocals

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
As she herself reaches in vain to find the highs

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
Among an assumedly depressing existence

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
It is a tragedy, but one of the most poignant of that

32:45.000 --> 32:49.000
Perfect Places is a beautiful cut of Lorde's album

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
The troublesome messages dealt with and addressed in such a nuanced way

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
It is really admirable, fantastic

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
I don't know what to say, check it out

32:56.000 --> 33:01.000
For those who know me well, you'll likely know that my 2017 wasn't the easiest of years

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
I had a lot of things that just seemed to turn against me when I least needed them

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
Times have been challenging, but with the faith of many people close to me

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
I managed to stay afloat

33:09.000 --> 33:13.000
Music is part of that, so these songs reflect me and who I am in many ways

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
And sometimes you don't need a bohemian rhapsody to speak the world to you

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
Sometimes the right song can come along and reach out to you

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
A mix of being personal enough and yet still being masterful about what it aims to achieve

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
So without further ado, here's your number one

33:41.000 --> 33:45.000
The messages that the song Brother promotes are the sort of messages that keep me going

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
In the face of adversity, it's a simple message, but it's done so brilliantly

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
From the steel pan riff that opens up and anchors a lot of the song

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
To the sensitive vocals that address people going through hard times

33:56.000 --> 34:00.000
To keep your head up over these soft, tropical synths that just envelop you

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
The washed out guitar fluttering over the back of the mix

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
Combined with the repetition of the aforementioned phrase

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Make it a real compositional masterpiece

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
It's identifiable, it's unique, but it's still general in its address

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
There's this acknowledgement that it may not be working out

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
And it may not all just tie up immediately

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
But as they plead with the listener to carry on in spite of what's pulling them down

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
And they try to convey the hope of what they know may not be there

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
You feel it

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
I feel it

34:25.000 --> 34:30.000
And that is for sure what really made this one reach out to me like no other song truly did

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
That's why it is here

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
Keeping your head up is not just about persevering and not letting yourself drown

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
It is about pride

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
It's about dignity

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
It's about loving yourself in spite of your own doubts

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Brother is a lot deeper than it looks

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
Much like a lot of the water that we often find ourselves thrown into

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
The most important message from Brother is that it may be shit now

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
But it can get better

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
And I want to pass that message on to anyone going through tough times right now

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
It may be hard currently

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
You may feel the strain, the burden that life sometimes weighs us down with

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
But you're never alone

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
And you don't ever have to think you're alone

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
And if you ever do feel alone

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
Drop me a line

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
I'm always on Twitter

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
I'm always on Discord

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
No one's ever that far

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
2017 could have been better for a lot of us

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Let's try and make 2018

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
A slight improvement

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
Anyway, I would love to hear your thoughts on what you believed were the best tunes

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
After all, my opinion is just one of many

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
I'm The Right Opinion

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
And I'll see you in the next one
