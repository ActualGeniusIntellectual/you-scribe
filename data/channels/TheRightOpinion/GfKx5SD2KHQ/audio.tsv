0	2000	I said I'd do it, so here I am.
2000	11000	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
11000	17000	And today I follow through on something that I have been planning for the whole year, the Top 25 Best Songs of 2017.
17000	22000	Now obviously this video isn't quite as objective as the title will imply, it's just the one that had the best ring to it.
22000	27000	I accept that there are probably better songs in many regards, and I'll probably expand on that in the video at certain points.
27000	34000	But these are the songs that I want to come back to, time and time again, because of some special quality not held in other songs throughout this year.
34000	42000	2017 itself was a weird year, a lot of mainstream pop became very bland, so I ended up in this weird, hybrid, alt music genre a lot of the time.
42000	49000	There was a lot of great music this year, and I want to emphasise that, and a lot of songs were very painful to cut because of their fantastic quality.
49000	53000	However, I had to make a decision to get 25 top quality songs out.
53000	58000	However, before we do that, let's look at what the music reviewers call the honourable mentions.
83000	87000	Hey, hey, so won't you open up the sunroof, yeah
114000	116000	Let you go
117000	126000	Because I'm 18, and I still live with my parents, yeah they're not like yours, well yours I'm understanding
126000	136000	You hang in line, you find it hard to define, but you do it all the time, when you do it again, looking for signs of light
136000	145000	Run around on me, oh my god, take me slow, get it fast, go
156000	160000	Now, when I started compiling this list, I originally intended it to cover the top 20.
160000	166000	However, that plan had to change when I realised that there were some songs just below 20 that did deserve more in-depth analysis.
166000	169000	This wasn't one of them, but I'm still glad it's here.
170000	179000	I'm facing my faults, overcoming my addictions, talking out loud, when I'm talking about love
183000	188000	I heard this one and sunroof back when I was entering the summer and I realised they were both really good pop rock songs
188000	191000	But I wasn't sure which one would edge it long term, this one did.
191000	195000	The bright guitar riffs with the pre-chorus before it kicks in with the bass on the first verse
195000	199000	As this loser sings about how his life is completely fucked with the chorus being this pop drop
199000	204000	Which is more likeable than it has any right to be, the buzzing bass synths on the second verse, the rhythmic bridge
204000	208000	All encompassed by this sheer desperation just to make for this really actually enjoyable listen
208000	213000	It's a song about losing your wits, but it has so much fun with it that it is just impossible to ignore
213000	217000	And that's why this one is at 25. Love it.
217000	221000	This song is a bit of an outcast from the other ones on the list, it has quite a dry sound
221000	224000	And when I started going over my year end favourites I didn't really consider it
224000	229000	But listen after listen, I realised it was pretty fucking great
242000	248000	Liam Gallagher brings this A game on the song which is essentially a diss track to people who always want more than they can have
248000	249000	By hook or by crook
249000	255000	Firstly the drum work is fantastic, it's pulsating, it drives a great groove with fantastic blending between acoustic and electric guitar
255000	260000	Before this massive chorus jumps in as he tells this twat that he has the Midas touch
260000	265000	And this is the thing, Liam Gallagher sells it, if anyone doesn't give a fuck it is Liam Gallagher
265000	267000	Which makes this song even more glorious
267000	272000	And this beautiful beautiful part towards the end with the horns and this conglomerate of guitars everywhere
272000	276000	It really is special, it's a song that goes places and knows how to use Liam Gallagher
276000	279000	He is gonna get this person and even I'm a bit scared
279000	283000	I don't mind Post Malone, I think he's a pretty great guy all round, he makes some decent songs
283000	287000	But if you told me I'd be including him in a year end list, yeah, sure mate
287000	288000	Probably would have chuckled
288000	292000	I mean this song isn't necessarily his song, it's a feature, but it counts enough
292000	293000	Counts enough
306000	310000	Ok so first things first, any song that uses a sliding chord structure sounds pretty fucking cool
310000	313000	With this smokey bass line that just eats up the song
313000	317000	Post Malone and Watts vocals couldn't be a better combination as they are both massive warblers
317000	319000	And it really does complement a beat like this
319000	323000	I love the melodic direction as well, there's variation in vocal delivery with every single line
323000	325000	It gives it a very unique personality
325000	327000	This is also reflected in the instrumental
327000	331000	Which varies impressively despite its seemingly limited range of inputs
331000	334000	Before launching into this fantastic guitar solo
334000	336000	And one that we definitely need a bit more of
336000	338000	I haven't spoken about the lyrics because there's not too much to say
338000	342000	They're kicking ass and hey ho, who needs deep shit when you're kicking ass
343000	346000	There are a few songs that are definitely better than their brand
346000	349000	Once again that's mainly because this video is quite personal to me
349000	353000	With that said it doesn't mean that songs can't be appreciated for their craftsmanship
353000	356000	And this next one is definitely an example of that
369000	371000	This song is an instrumental masterpiece
371000	374000	Really integrating a lot of the oriental inspiration for this song
374000	377000	With very glossy yet fleshed out synthesizers
377000	379000	With this shimmering piano and smooth backing vocals
379000	383000	And intermittent guitar work all composed together so well
383000	385000	It really lends for a particularly lingering atmosphere
385000	389000	There's this constant state of musical evolution throughout this five minutes
389000	392000	Going over musical bridges and transitions and so much more
392000	393000	It's really quite beautiful
393000	398000	The song itself is about envy and how the artist would love to have the clout to tour the world
398000	401000	It's a personal message, maybe one that doesn't quite resonate with me
401000	403000	Or with the mood of the song
403000	405000	But I can still admire it nonetheless
405000	409000	As number 22 proved, I do place emphasis on a song's instrumental work
409000	413000	I still prefer a complete piece even if some parts may be weaker on an individual basis
413000	417000	As contrast, number 21 proves incredibly strong in all categories
417000	419000	Hence why it's just above Tokyo
429000	431000	I mean, let's get something clear here
431000	433000	The instrumental work is still fantastic
433000	435000	You can never have too many guitar tones
435000	437000	But the mood of this is much deeper
437000	438000	Maybe too deep for some
438000	442000	As he cryptically and desperately searches for meanings and roots to his aforementioned pain
442000	443000	It is brooding, it is thoughtful
443000	445000	And it's interwoven with beautiful guitar work
445000	446000	It's all here
446000	449000	I think I counted at least three different guitar solos
449000	451000	The song just lets you slip away to it
451000	452000	Without revealing too much
452000	454000	It may not be a tearjoker
454000	456000	But it is one that just stops you
456000	458000	And leaves you in a very contemplative mood
458000	460000	And for that, it's really quite special
460000	463000	So, now the top 20, the tracks that we're always gonna beat here
463000	466000	This next track demonstrates how I value emotional resonance
466000	469000	As an important factor to how I enjoy a song
469000	471000	Arguably not as complex as the previous songs
471000	473000	But one that still touches me
473000	474000	Nonetheless
487000	488000	Ignore the part 2
488000	490000	They're both the same, just one without Kiara
490000	492000	Though Kiara is what makes the difference in this instance
492000	494000	The original wouldn't have made it
494000	495000	By providing a second perspective
495000	497000	It lends the song to significantly more depth
497000	498000	Than it has any right to have
498000	500000	And gives us this tone about two lovers
500000	502000	Reminiscing about their previous times together
502000	504000	And despite the track intimacy that it provides
504000	507000	You feel that they're not really talking face to face
507000	509000	Juxtaposing the lyrical symmetry
509000	511000	With the contemplation that they may never reunite
511000	513000	And that's a very bittersweet tone
513000	516000	The song's composition, which is this soft synth guitar mix
516000	519000	Really knows how to supplement the mood with that post-chorus drop
519000	522000	Almost being this catharsis of emotion that both these people feel
522000	524000	I don't know if it's what they went for
524000	525000	But it worked
525000	526000	So, props to them
526000	529000	Most of these songs aren't ones that have been released in the last month
529000	532000	Because normally I need some time to let them sink in
532000	535000	At the time of writing, this one was released in the last month
535000	538000	Because as soon as I heard it, I knew it was making my list
538000	540000	One way or another
544000	559000	This song perfectly encapsulates the euphoria in an admittedly slightly unhealthy obsession
559000	561000	But in a way, I think Gardner understands that
561000	564000	As these cascading synths and drums collapse around his quirky vocals
564000	568000	You feel the joy and the turmoil of having feelings for someone
568000	570000	There's that sentiment that the recipient of this love
570000	572000	May never even be aware of themselves
572000	574000	The desperation with lyrics such as
574000	576000	But there's nothing else I can do
576000	579000	And comparing this person to factors such as religion show that he is locked
579000	582000	As the synths fade away for one more percussive pre-chorus
582000	585000	You feel his vocals bare and honest as they come
585000	587000	As he lays everything down one more time
587000	589000	Some may say the overuse of the line
589000	591000	I can't stop thinking about you is annoying
591000	592000	And I understand that
592000	596000	However for me it's quite masterful because it perfectly reflects the tone and the lyrics in a way
596000	598000	Making it catches all hell as well
598000	600000	And pretty damn great
600000	604000	I had a great year with some excellent albums from rappers who I hadn't paid too much of mind in the past
604000	606000	Given the proportion of music that I listened to
606000	608000	You won't find too much rap in these lists
608000	611000	But when you do find it, you know it's good
624000	626000	A lot of people have been putting Temptation on the list
626000	628000	And yes, that's definitely another fantastic song
628000	630000	But I rooted for this one when it came down to The Wire
630000	632000	And there are a few reasons for that
632000	635000	Firstly, the production on this song is simply fabulous
635000	637000	And it's not a style that I've heard too often as well
637000	638000	Then you have the lyrics
638000	640000	And it's not about the content itself, but it's the delivery
640000	642000	Joey has moments towards the end of the second verse
642000	645000	Where you feel like he is wearing his heart on his sleeve
645000	647000	And we don't hear that enough in music
647000	650000	It's all so distant, yet here he's selling his emotions to us
650000	652000	I feel like he is close to crying
652000	654000	And that is powerful in my mind
654000	656000	What finally pushes this song over the top
656000	661000	Is the outro that feels like it was inserted to give the audience that moment for contemplation
661000	663000	And I used every second
663000	665000	It's a song that I fully appreciate
665000	667000	Some songs are just anthems
667000	669000	And we need more anthems
669000	671000	On the first listen, I did not add this song to my favourites
671000	673000	Heaven knows why
673000	675000	But it's a hell of a good thing I came back to it
687000	692000	This is a song that is just required in a year of such depressing mainstream radio
692000	695000	I have a respect for music that can make the normal sound incredible
695000	698000	This song is about doing fuck all with a takeaway
698000	699000	And the one you love
699000	701000	But the lead sells it
701000	704000	Partly thanks to the focus being more on togetherness
704000	707000	But also due to the incredible instrumentation and melodic work
707000	709000	Multiple guitar tones, harmonies
709000	711000	With the sheer pounding elation of a soaring chorus
711000	713000	So desperately yearned for this year
713000	715000	The Amazons did a fantastic job
715000	719000	And this was not their only song that I absolutely loved this year
719000	721000	However this one was the best of the bunch
721000	723000	With its unique topic and sensational delivery
723000	726000	There is simply not much more that can be said
726000	729000	Often there are a few songs that get lost in rotation throughout the year
729000	732000	But upon re-listen, find themselves gradually moved up the list
732000	734000	Until they hit a new high
734000	737000	This is a song that I had written off out of all the songs here
737000	739000	And yet when I came back to it
739000	743000	I realised that it was actually a priceless slice of musical gold
745000	750000	On the air shouting out that you're ready to change
750000	753000	Ready to change
753000	756000	You can say what you want
756000	759000	The song opens with the vocalist cooing with real contempt
759000	762000	As tender but menacing pianos grow into this huge chorus
762000	765000	With propulsive hand claps and building drums
765000	768000	Before throwing itself into this guitar and vocal driven drop
768000	770000	With the piano hanging over the mix
770000	772000	Once again there's a real evolution
772000	774000	Each chorus is unique
774000	777000	Really giving a feeling of progress and building on the emotion
777000	780000	How many songs this year have just fucking died halfway through
780000	782000	Or pulled away from a large chorus
782000	785000	This song pulls no punches
785000	788000	To sum up, this song is about someone who is a bit of a cunt
788000	791000	But fucking hell, Kodaline frame it like they're bloody evil
791000	793000	And I thought Liam Gallagher was brutal
793000	795000	But the lead singer sounds legitimately angry
795000	799000	And to be honest, if this was directed at me, I would not recover
799000	801000	Fantastic track, check it out
801000	805000	Sometimes there is a song that has no right to be as good as it is
805000	807000	That despite its simple and humble beginnings
807000	809000	Everything has just fallen into place
809000	811000	This is one of those
811000	814000	Let me tell you who I am
814000	816000	I'm your biggest fan
816000	819000	Got your picture on my phone
819000	821000	I got tickets to your show
821000	823000	Girl let me tell you
823000	827000	This song is about someone who is using a very unique technique to pick up a girl
827000	830000	To the point of sounding slightly creepy to be honest
830000	832000	It shouldn't work well, but it does
832000	834000	And there is a reason for that
834000	836000	Will Joseph Cook, he sells it
836000	838000	He is such a charismatic vocalist
838000	841000	Effortlessly conveying the sentiment of dizzying infatuation
841000	844000	You feel that it's out of an adorable naivety
844000	846000	Rather than anything sinister thanks to that
846000	849000	This mood is only furthered by the infectious guitarist
849000	851000	That has sprinkled all over the song
851000	853000	Some more acoustic, others more electric
853000	855000	Yet they blend together so fluently
855000	858000	All of this combined makes for a truly joyous song
858000	860000	And one of the best of the year
860000	862000	Great work Will, keep it up
862000	864000	I think out of all the choices on this list
864000	866000	This is the corniest choice
866000	868000	In a year of rap geniuses such as
868000	870000	Joyner Lucas, Kendrick Lamar, and Ty the Creator
870000	872000	Gracing us with their presence
872000	874000	Including this guy and not those
874000	876000	Seems a bit of an insult
876000	878000	But although I accept that they have made
878000	880000	Objectively better songs, this is my list
880000	882000	But still
882000	884000	I just wanna be free
884000	886000	Not a slave to the stereotype
886000	888000	All alone in my room in the middle of the night
888000	890000	I don't have the words but my stereo mic
890000	892000	I don't wanna be black, I don't wanna be white
892000	894000	I just wanna be a man today
894000	895000	I don't wanna be a
895000	897000	Yes, I'm aware that Logic mentions
897000	898000	He's biracial too much
898000	900000	Yes, I'm aware the song has this weird
900000	902000	Slowed down outro
902000	904000	And yes, I'm aware the lyrics are corny as hell
904000	906000	But I just can't help myself
906000	907000	I love this song
907000	909000	From the bright piano keys to
909000	911000	Damien Lamar Hudson's beautiful vocal
911000	913000	Performance over an interlude where he just
913000	914000	Belts his lungs out
914000	916000	It's a song that lifts me up
916000	918000	And as I said, the lyrics are corny
918000	920000	But at least they promote a positive message for once
920000	922000	A message where you can be proud of your achievements
922000	924000	Regardless of the qualities on face value
924000	926000	In a year swamped in negativity
926000	927000	And stereotypes
927000	929000	This was actually kinda necessary and meaningful
929000	930000	To me
930000	932000	And the fact that Logic can take a personal story
932000	933000	And speak to the masses with it
933000	935000	Is quite special in itself
935000	937000	And looking in the comment section of the YouTube video
937000	939000	It clearly reaches a lot of people
939000	941000	I'm gonna defend its choice here
941000	944000	Even though I accept that there may be other better ones
944000	947000	Some songs are on this list because they're evocative
947000	949000	Other songs are just too well made to ignore
949000	952000	However, this is one song that I can't really decide
952000	953000	Which build that fits
953000	954000	Maybe both
955000	956000	I could rain
956000	961000	Come and let me walk away
963000	967000	I won't look back
967000	969000	Geowolf made a masterpiece
969000	971000	This song's sweeping tone
971000	972000	Leaves me in the same
972000	974000	Contemplated mood every time
974000	977000	The soft electric guitars blending effortlessly
977000	979000	With this excellent synth
979000	981000	Which grow into the first verse
981000	983000	As the singer searches for a love among
984000	986000	Before blooming into this beautiful chorus
986000	989000	Where all the previous components come into play
989000	992000	And she confronts her love and his indecision
992000	994000	With these shimmering synths in the second verse
994000	996000	And this monumental bridge
996000	998000	Where she realises that she might have found some closure
998000	1002000	The production is undeniable in helping that
1002000	1005000	And the lead singer could not be better suited to that production
1005000	1008000	Her airy vocals floating over the mix
1008000	1010000	Bathing in it without drowning in it
1010000	1012000	This song really is spotless
1012000	1015000	Albeit a bit alien to me
1015000	1016000	Amazing
1016000	1017000	Keep it up
1018000	1021000	Every year I'll find out about one or two artists
1021000	1023000	That I think deserve to be the next big thing
1023000	1025000	This year there was only one of those
1025000	1028000	Whose music I really consistently enjoyed
1028000	1031000	And it was only right that he be included in this list
1031000	1034000	Because there were plenty more songs of his to choose from
1035000	1039000	Cause I believe in Karma
1039000	1042000	And you believe in Karma
1042000	1045000	You should try a little harder
1045000	1047000	Oh Karma's gonna fall
1047000	1049000	As the stiff acoustic guitar line kicks in
1049000	1051000	Over some very dry drum work
1051000	1053000	Tom Walker sings aggravatively
1053000	1056000	About this naughty wench who's fucking around with him
1056000	1058000	And as the pre-chorus creeps in
1058000	1059000	This swell of synths around you
1059000	1062000	And you feel like something is going to happen
1062000	1064000	At a lot of points this year, nothing happens
1064000	1066000	It just does this disappointing drop
1066000	1069000	And you're left feeling like a fucking wet flannel
1069000	1072000	And yet with Tom Walker, you get that payoff
1072000	1074000	You get that massive chorus
1074000	1079000	And it's so refreshing because Tom Walker has managed to understand the art of the climax
1079000	1083000	With all the instruments synchronizing perfectly behind Walker's voice in this chorus
1083000	1085000	To give it real gravitas
1085000	1087000	Too many vocals have backed away from the chorus this year
1087000	1089000	Walker is no coward
1089000	1092000	The foreboding premise of Karma itself is pretty ingenious
1092000	1094000	And definitely aids the very sinister tone
1094000	1098000	And that final breakdown where Walker just lets loose on this girl
1098000	1100000	I'd just be as scared as her at that point
1100000	1103000	You don't really know exactly what Walker's promising you
1103000	1106000	But that ambiguity plays into the particularly uneasy aura
1106000	1110000	Menacing and brilliant truly masterful aspect of the song
1110000	1112000	Truly fucking great, thank you for this
1112000	1116000	Last year I placed my hood at the top of the year end list
1116000	1118000	It was a song that spoke from personal perspective
1118000	1120000	Yet appealed to a general audience
1120000	1124000	And that sort of juxtaposition of detail and universality always rivets me
1124000	1127000	Particularly if the message is one that resonates
1127000	1131000	This year, that artist Ray BLK didn't quite hit those highs
1131000	1133000	But with the help of upcoming singer Dan Kaplan
1133000	1135000	She found her way back onto the list
1135000	1140000	Living by the numbers cause you and me
1140000	1143000	Go through it like the others
1143000	1145000	And the highs don't feel the same
1145000	1148000	And you still get drunk and flushed as rain
1148000	1150000	As I've said earlier this video
1150000	1153000	A song about mediocrities of life being made surprisingly pleasurable
1153000	1156000	Is always appealing to someone like myself
1156000	1158000	As the hollow synths buzz in the background
1158000	1162000	Kaplan's frothy baritone reflects on the unhealthy but gratifying lifestyle
1162000	1164000	That he and Ray BLK lead
1164000	1166000	As the stiff piano kicks in on the chorus
1166000	1169000	We hit that sour high that Kaplan is trying to project
1169000	1171000	The dysfunctional exhilaration
1171000	1174000	Ray BLK fits perfectly to play that partner in crime
1174000	1176000	With the tender harmony on the second chorus
1176000	1177000	But let's face it
1177000	1179000	The reason that song is here
1179000	1180000	Is because of the bridge
1180000	1181000	That fucking bridge
1181000	1183000	As the synths and piano mesh together
1183000	1186000	In this apocalyptic, alcoholic, infused chaos
1186000	1188000	You realise that the protagonist
1188000	1190000	May never escape that state that they are in
1190000	1192000	You feel the joy in the euphoria
1192000	1194000	As it all falls down around them
1194000	1195000	And as the beat drops out
1195000	1197000	You feel yourself drowning with them
1197000	1199000	Before that final chorus
1199000	1202000	That is just the best culmination of the previous components
1202000	1204000	It's a great slice of contemporary music
1204000	1206000	And more than enough reason
1206000	1208000	That the song finds itself here
1208000	1211000	Halsey, an artist I never really got into
1211000	1213000	And I'm not sure I ever truly will
1213000	1214000	But on our last album
1214000	1216000	There was one song called Roman Holiday
1216000	1218000	Which was simply sensational
1218000	1221000	And it demonstrated a level of introspection
1221000	1223000	Not shown in a lot of modern pop cuts
1223000	1225000	I don't know if she'll ever hit that high again
1225000	1228000	And her latest album left me fairly indifferent
1228000	1230000	But damn, when she strikes gold
1230000	1231000	She strikes gold
1232000	1236000	Said that we're not lovers
1237000	1240000	We're just strangers
1241000	1244000	With the same damn hunger
1245000	1247000	Strangers is a hollow, hollow song
1247000	1249000	But from the industrial drum to the creeping synths
1249000	1252000	It really creates a brooding atmosphere of mystique
1252000	1254000	Which is well suited to this tune, must I add
1254000	1257000	The chorus itself is like a controlled explosion
1257000	1259000	It grows so much but stays so tight
1259000	1262000	With these Roman choir vocals dripping through the back of the mix
1262000	1264000	It engulfs the listener
1264000	1266000	Lauren Jauregui does a fantastic guest performance
1266000	1268000	Adding a very nice tinge of soul to her part
1268000	1270000	And the harmonisation on the choruses
1270000	1271000	Create moments to behold
1271000	1274000	The context about the attempts to move on from a relationship
1274000	1276000	And the passion that drives it
1276000	1278000	Dealing with separation from something that's not working out
1278000	1280000	But still having to live with feelings that linger
1280000	1283000	It's a simple message but very powerfully done
1283000	1285000	And the two person perspective definitely aids that
1285000	1288000	Preventing it from sounding petty or creepy
1288000	1290000	Fantastic song, check it out
1291000	1292000	There was a cut off this year
1292000	1295000	For songs that really emotionally moved me
1295000	1298000	These top 9 songs enter that new tier
1298000	1300000	A tier of emotional resonance for me personally
1300000	1303000	Songs that I could sit down to and emote over
1303000	1306000	This next song is the only massive hit on the list
1306000	1309000	And whereas many mainstream songs could wear out their welcome due to overplay
1309000	1311000	This one never got old
1311000	1317000	And I miss the way you make me feel
1317000	1322000	It's real when we watch the sunset
1322000	1326000	Over the castle only
1326000	1328000	Castle on the Hill opens with soft guitar tones
1328000	1332000	As Ed Sheeran's voice reminisces over the energetic but slightly reserved beat
1332000	1335000	As the drums and haunting vocals kick in on the pre-chorus
1335000	1337000	You feel the memories slowly returning
1337000	1339000	And then what makes this song? The chorus
1339000	1341000	This truly euphoric moment
1341000	1344000	Suddenly that soft guitar tone becomes the peak of a soaring mix
1344000	1346000	That captures so much raw emotion
1346000	1348000	With Ed putting in one of his greatest vocal performances to date
1348000	1350000	The joy and the pain
1350000	1353000	And all these powerful emotions that seem to desert some of us into adulthood
1353000	1355000	There is a uniqueness in being young
1355000	1359000	And the individual moments that we'll probably never be able to relive
1359000	1361000	And Ed Sheeran understands that
1361000	1362000	And then there's the bridge
1362000	1364000	And the fucking bridge man
1364000	1366000	Where there is this confrontation with the present
1366000	1369000	And the moment that not everyone has fully realised what they want to be
1369000	1372000	That bittersweet moment is a borderline tearjerk for me
1372000	1374000	The framing is something special
1374000	1377000	And although Ed Sheeran surprised me by selecting this as a single
1377000	1380000	It was the best surprise possible
1380000	1381000	Fantastic
1381000	1384000	I've never really rated All Time Low too much
1384000	1386000	They have had some very good songs
1386000	1389000	But a lot of their music doesn't leave a huge impact on me
1389000	1390000	Not bad by any means
1390000	1393000	But I wouldn't expect it to be putting it on my best list
1393000	1395000	So you know what this means
1395000	1396000	A contradiction
1409000	1412000	In many ways it makes sense to have this and cast on the hill back to back
1412000	1415000	Because they are very similar in this sentiment
1415000	1418000	The mature singer reflecting on the days when they had that youth
1418000	1420000	The wish to return to better days
1420000	1423000	I feel this song goes one step further than the previous
1423000	1425000	Delving into the emotional psyche of the lead singer
1425000	1428000	Addressing feelings of losing someone dear to you
1428000	1430000	Denial a regret that you can't return to that time
1430000	1433000	And then the resolve to accept that you have to grow up
1433000	1435000	The memories that you had with that person
1435000	1437000	Trying to tell yourself it was never going to work out
1437000	1440000	But still considering the possibilities if it did
1440000	1443000	The final line of the song alters the auxiliary verb for one final twist
1443000	1445000	And it's a nice little touch
1445000	1447000	The production and melody is a real step up
1447000	1449000	Really building up to this emotional high on the chorus
1449000	1451000	With this propulsive blend of guitar tones
1451000	1453000	With these liquid drums really pinning down a mix
1453000	1455000	That could have been too loose
1455000	1458000	The melody really lets the vocalist lay bare his feelings
1458000	1461000	While still retaining a lot of all time lows personality
1461000	1463000	That made them popular with the fans in the first place
1463000	1466000	It's a song that finds maturity and age
1466000	1469000	But still finds themselves in a lot of the roots that they base themselves in
1469000	1471000	It really disappoints me when I find an artist
1471000	1473000	Who barely any viewers have heard of
1473000	1476000	And for me it's so objectively clear how great they are
1476000	1478000	That I have to share
1478000	1481000	And so with this next song it is one of those moments
1481000	1487000	Princess in a castle you're a diva
1487000	1492000	Everybody said that I should leave you
1492000	1494000	Mood swing back in
1494000	1496000	Sony's Princess tells us the simple story
1496000	1499000	About an entitled female who is draining Sony's mental
1499000	1501000	And maybe even physical resources
1501000	1503000	The song opens with these delicate drums
1503000	1505000	And delicious layered vocals
1505000	1507000	With guitar work that would make angels cry
1507000	1509000	Sony's melodic composition is on point
1509000	1512000	As he delivers intonations and inflections with ease
1512000	1514000	And then the chorus just slides in
1514000	1516000	With all these components put together
1516000	1518000	And there are just these nice little tweaks
1518000	1519000	That could have been left out
1519000	1521000	But yet he chooses to insert
1521000	1523000	And they enhance the mix so much more
1523000	1525000	The drum dropout at the start of the second verse
1525000	1527000	The organ line in the second chorus
1527000	1530000	And the solo guitar that is just laced throughout the whole song
1530000	1533000	But really the cherry on the cake is Sony himself
1533000	1535000	Who has an unassailable vocal presence
1535000	1538000	It's really the performance of the year
1538000	1540000	There is no questioning that in my opinion
1540000	1542000	He had a heavy lumbering mix on the song
1542000	1545000	And yet pulled it off with this beautiful performance
1545000	1547000	So complete credit to him
1547000	1550000	This is a great song and he made it happen
1550000	1552000	When writing up the shortlist for this
1552000	1554000	I realised that I didn't have any grime songs
1554000	1556000	It wasn't that there aren't any good ones out there
1556000	1558000	They just didn't make the cut this year
1558000	1559000	I like my grime
1559000	1561000	Last year I had Holy Grime by WALL-E
1561000	1563000	And This Is England by Kano in my top 20
1563000	1566000	So in an attempt to see if I had missed any at all
1566000	1568000	I listened once more to a few grime albums
1568000	1570000	I didn't quite find a grime song
1570000	1572000	But I did find something
1585000	1588000	I don't think I ever considered myself to be including a religious song
1588000	1591000	Friends know that I'm fairly cynical towards religion
1591000	1594000	But unlike a lot of tunes this doesn't speak down to the listener
1594000	1598000	You feel like Stormzy is standing right beside you as he presents this
1598000	1601000	And it fortunately leans more on the spiritual side without being preachy
1601000	1604000	He is thanking God but I honestly couldn't care
1604000	1607000	He just sounds so grateful, so likeable, so genuine
1607000	1611000	It reaches out to anyone who hopes they can be lifted up with or without celestial means
1611000	1613000	The organ swell, the touch of the guitar
1613000	1617000	And Jesus Christ, MNEK's vocalisation and harmonies are unbelievable
1617000	1620000	He is on a completely different level in this song
1620000	1624000	And I'll tell you this much, the idea of God may not be one that I have in my heart
1624000	1628000	But the idea of thankfulness, for the support when all seems lost
1628000	1631000	Yeah I feel that, so thank you Stormzy for this song
1631000	1634000	So when Tom Walker released Karma earlier this year
1634000	1636000	I thought to myself, what a great tune
1636000	1638000	This is easily his best all year
1638000	1642000	Tom Walker, not to be outdone, decided to release another song
1642000	1644000	And fucking hell
1650000	1656000	I will leave the light on
1656000	1660000	It's crazy that we have to rely on indie artists for the best drops these days
1660000	1663000	The chiming synths hit like a ton of bricks
1663000	1666000	As Tom Walker roars with passion that no man can match
1666000	1669000	The song itself is essentially an open letter to a friend
1669000	1672000	Who is going through a hard time and turning to drug abuse
1672000	1675000	It's a dark topic but like the lighthouse that Tom Walker has set up
1675000	1677000	There is still a shred of hope
1677000	1680000	The soft piano building on the chorus is sentimental and potent
1680000	1683000	And the bridge where you feel that desperation in his voice and lyrics building
1683000	1686000	That he knows that his friend is in danger but he still refuses to give up
1686000	1689000	The determination of that is brilliant
1689000	1693000	The sheer belief and faith in Walker's delivery is truly outstanding
1693000	1696000	It sounds like he's been there and he sells it like he has
1696000	1699000	And I would say more but I don't know what to say
1699000	1701000	You just have to check it out for yourself
1701000	1703000	It is sensational
1703000	1707000	I love it when a band can take elements of the old and integrate them with the new
1707000	1709000	That's what Def Havana did this year
1709000	1711000	And I give them a lot of credit for it
1711000	1713000	They really transformed music to me
1713000	1716000	But to go one step beyond and make a damn masterpiece
1716000	1719000	They didn't have to but they fucking did
1720000	1723000	When my lungs collapse and my heart turns black
1723000	1726000	I'll bring my ashes to the cold
1732000	1735000	When actually writing this script I was listening to the songs
1735000	1737000	To make sure that I was getting all the points down
1737000	1740000	And this is where the emotions really did get the better of me
1740000	1743000	But I think I can keep it composed without the musical accompaniment here
1743000	1747000	In this song the lead vocalist deals with issues of isolation, depression, separation
1747000	1751000	And returning to the places of foregone memories to try and cleanse yourself of those feelings
1751000	1756000	The lyrics utilise anecdotes and metaphors to tell a story with incredible poetic depth
1756000	1759000	The singer goes through these issues systematically in the verses
1759000	1765000	Utilising an acoustic guitar before exploding into a huge chorus with bittersweet emotional highs
1765000	1768000	It is a moment of real musical transcendence
1768000	1771000	The piano bridge after the first verse is a great touch as well
1771000	1775000	And just when I thought I couldn't top all these swelling emotions
1775000	1779000	The bridge comes in and he confronts what he has lost as he sings
1779000	1782000	If I could find the legs to stand on or something
1782000	1784000	Maybe I could take control of my own life
1784000	1787000	You realise that he may never get that closure that he yearns for
1787000	1790000	Because he hasn't truly realised a problem
1790000	1793000	And then it just launches into this huge instrumental break
1793000	1795000	That just tries me every time
1795000	1796000	This song is brilliant
1796000	1798000	There's nothing more to be said
1800000	1801000	John Mayer
1801000	1803000	I don't know what the fuck happened
1803000	1804000	He's here
1806000	1808000	And what about this feeling
1808000	1811000	That I'm never good enough
1811000	1814000	Will it wash out in the water
1814000	1817000	Or is it always in the blood
1817000	1820000	Yes, John Mayer is an incredibly talented person
1820000	1822000	But his music never really had much of an effect on me
1822000	1826000	That was until mid 2017 when I heard this cut and dam
1826000	1829000	In this song, Mayer addresses a lot of his insecurities
1829000	1832000	And poses the ever important question of nature or nurture
1832000	1836000	The interesting thing is that a lot of his questions don't have clear answers
1836000	1840000	Are a lot of the feelings we have innate or can we circumvent them for the better of our health
1840000	1842000	This framing is particularly important
1842000	1846000	As it's quite rare that we have an artist frame himself with that much equivocation
1846000	1850000	In a way enacting a double blind because he's not even truly aware of the answer himself
1850000	1854000	All of this presented over some of the best production work in his career
1854000	1856000	Originating with the acoustic guitar
1856000	1859000	The slow introduction of more and more guitars throughout the mix
1859000	1861000	Is such a fantastic touch
1861000	1863000	It takes it in new directions every time
1863000	1866000	And all topped off with an appropriately soft
1866000	1869000	But an appropriately beautifully breezy guitar solo
1869000	1871000	Which just elevates the song more and more
1871000	1873000	It is easy going, it is John Mayer
1873000	1876000	But it's still emotionally very resonant
1876000	1878000	Honestly it is a brilliant tune
1878000	1880000	And I am so happy that it's here
1880000	1883000	And I'm so happy that John Mayer made it happen
1883000	1886000	Lorde had a commercially disappointing year
1886000	1889000	But it didn't prevent her from putting out a pretty damn great album
1889000	1893000	Now a lot of critics chose to insert Greenlight or Liability
1893000	1895000	Which are very strong songs as well
1895000	1898000	But I had to go for something a bit more personal
1911000	1914000	The song Perfect Places is about emotional catharsis
1914000	1917000	Through partying, alcohol and dubious substances
1917000	1919000	As emotional highs are becoming harder to find
1919000	1921000	She searches more and more desperately
1921000	1923000	Romantic things like kissing and taking off clothes
1923000	1925000	Are resigned to be mere functions
1925000	1927000	As the hollow drums pound in the background
1927000	1930000	And we reach the final outro with Lorde questioning the existence
1930000	1934000	Of these Perfect Places over these monumental synthesizer tones
1934000	1937000	We realise that Lorde has come full circle
1937000	1940000	And that everywhere she searches for those Perfect Places
1940000	1942000	All of the new highs lose their novelty
1942000	1945000	And no longer fulfil what was desired
1945000	1947000	That is one powerful message
1947000	1949000	The synth swell and melodic delivery in the chorus
1949000	1952000	Really highlight the double edged sword of the message
1952000	1954000	You feel the joy but you also feel a lot of the turmoil
1954000	1956000	The slight push on Lorde's vocals
1956000	1959000	As she herself reaches in vain to find the highs
1959000	1962000	Among an assumedly depressing existence
1962000	1965000	It is a tragedy, but one of the most poignant of that
1965000	1969000	Perfect Places is a beautiful cut of Lorde's album
1969000	1972000	The troublesome messages dealt with and addressed in such a nuanced way
1972000	1974000	It is really admirable, fantastic
1974000	1976000	I don't know what to say, check it out
1976000	1981000	For those who know me well, you'll likely know that my 2017 wasn't the easiest of years
1981000	1984000	I had a lot of things that just seemed to turn against me when I least needed them
1984000	1987000	Times have been challenging, but with the faith of many people close to me
1987000	1989000	I managed to stay afloat
1989000	1993000	Music is part of that, so these songs reflect me and who I am in many ways
1993000	1997000	And sometimes you don't need a bohemian rhapsody to speak the world to you
1997000	2000000	Sometimes the right song can come along and reach out to you
2000000	2004000	A mix of being personal enough and yet still being masterful about what it aims to achieve
2004000	2007000	So without further ado, here's your number one
2021000	2025000	The messages that the song Brother promotes are the sort of messages that keep me going
2025000	2029000	In the face of adversity, it's a simple message, but it's done so brilliantly
2030000	2033000	From the steel pan riff that opens up and anchors a lot of the song
2033000	2036000	To the sensitive vocals that address people going through hard times
2036000	2040000	To keep your head up over these soft, tropical synths that just envelop you
2040000	2042000	The washed out guitar fluttering over the back of the mix
2042000	2045000	Combined with the repetition of the aforementioned phrase
2045000	2047000	Make it a real compositional masterpiece
2047000	2051000	It's identifiable, it's unique, but it's still general in its address
2051000	2054000	There's this acknowledgement that it may not be working out
2054000	2056000	And it may not all just tie up immediately
2056000	2060000	But as they plead with the listener to carry on in spite of what's pulling them down
2060000	2063000	And they try to convey the hope of what they know may not be there
2063000	2064000	You feel it
2064000	2065000	I feel it
2065000	2070000	And that is for sure what really made this one reach out to me like no other song truly did
2070000	2072000	That's why it is here
2072000	2076000	Keeping your head up is not just about persevering and not letting yourself drown
2076000	2077000	It is about pride
2077000	2078000	It's about dignity
2078000	2080000	It's about loving yourself in spite of your own doubts
2080000	2082000	Brother is a lot deeper than it looks
2082000	2086000	Much like a lot of the water that we often find ourselves thrown into
2086000	2089000	The most important message from Brother is that it may be shit now
2089000	2090000	But it can get better
2090000	2094000	And I want to pass that message on to anyone going through tough times right now
2094000	2095000	It may be hard currently
2095000	2098000	You may feel the strain, the burden that life sometimes weighs us down with
2098000	2099000	But you're never alone
2099000	2101000	And you don't ever have to think you're alone
2101000	2103000	And if you ever do feel alone
2103000	2104000	Drop me a line
2104000	2105000	I'm always on Twitter
2105000	2106000	I'm always on Discord
2106000	2107000	No one's ever that far
2107000	2110000	2017 could have been better for a lot of us
2110000	2111000	Let's try and make 2018
2111000	2113000	A slight improvement
2113000	2117000	Anyway, I would love to hear your thoughts on what you believed were the best tunes
2117000	2120000	After all, my opinion is just one of many
2120000	2122000	I'm The Right Opinion
2122000	2123000	And I'll see you in the next one
