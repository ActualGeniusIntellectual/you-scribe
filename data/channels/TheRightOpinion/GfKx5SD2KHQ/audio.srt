1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I said I'd do it, so here I am.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And today I follow through on something that I have been planning for the whole year, the Top 25 Best Songs of 2017.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now obviously this video isn't quite as objective as the title will imply, it's just the one that had the best ring to it.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I accept that there are probably better songs in many regards, and I'll probably expand on that in the video at certain points.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But these are the songs that I want to come back to, time and time again, because of some special quality not held in other songs throughout this year.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
2017 itself was a weird year, a lot of mainstream pop became very bland, so I ended up in this weird, hybrid, alt music genre a lot of the time.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
There was a lot of great music this year, and I want to emphasise that, and a lot of songs were very painful to cut because of their fantastic quality.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
However, I had to make a decision to get 25 top quality songs out.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
However, before we do that, let's look at what the music reviewers call the honourable mentions.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hey, hey, so won't you open up the sunroof, yeah

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Let you go

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Because I'm 18, and I still live with my parents, yeah they're not like yours, well yours I'm understanding

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You hang in line, you find it hard to define, but you do it all the time, when you do it again, looking for signs of light

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Run around on me, oh my god, take me slow, get it fast, go

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Now, when I started compiling this list, I originally intended it to cover the top 20.

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
However, that plan had to change when I realised that there were some songs just below 20 that did deserve more in-depth analysis.

18
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This wasn't one of them, but I'm still glad it's here.

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm facing my faults, overcoming my addictions, talking out loud, when I'm talking about love

20
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I heard this one and sunroof back when I was entering the summer and I realised they were both really good pop rock songs

21
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But I wasn't sure which one would edge it long term, this one did.

22
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The bright guitar riffs with the pre-chorus before it kicks in with the bass on the first verse

23
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
As this loser sings about how his life is completely fucked with the chorus being this pop drop

24
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Which is more likeable than it has any right to be, the buzzing bass synths on the second verse, the rhythmic bridge

25
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
All encompassed by this sheer desperation just to make for this really actually enjoyable listen

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's a song about losing your wits, but it has so much fun with it that it is just impossible to ignore

27
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And that's why this one is at 25. Love it.

28
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
This song is a bit of an outcast from the other ones on the list, it has quite a dry sound

29
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And when I started going over my year end favourites I didn't really consider it

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But listen after listen, I realised it was pretty fucking great

31
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Liam Gallagher brings this A game on the song which is essentially a diss track to people who always want more than they can have

32
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
By hook or by crook

33
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Firstly the drum work is fantastic, it's pulsating, it drives a great groove with fantastic blending between acoustic and electric guitar

34
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Before this massive chorus jumps in as he tells this twat that he has the Midas touch

35
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And this is the thing, Liam Gallagher sells it, if anyone doesn't give a fuck it is Liam Gallagher

36
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Which makes this song even more glorious

37
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And this beautiful beautiful part towards the end with the horns and this conglomerate of guitars everywhere

38
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It really is special, it's a song that goes places and knows how to use Liam Gallagher

39
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
He is gonna get this person and even I'm a bit scared

40
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I don't mind Post Malone, I think he's a pretty great guy all round, he makes some decent songs

41
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But if you told me I'd be including him in a year end list, yeah, sure mate

42
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Probably would have chuckled

43
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I mean this song isn't necessarily his song, it's a feature, but it counts enough

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Counts enough

45
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Ok so first things first, any song that uses a sliding chord structure sounds pretty fucking cool

46
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
With this smokey bass line that just eats up the song

47
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Post Malone and Watts vocals couldn't be a better combination as they are both massive warblers

48
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And it really does complement a beat like this

49
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I love the melodic direction as well, there's variation in vocal delivery with every single line

50
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It gives it a very unique personality

51
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This is also reflected in the instrumental

52
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Which varies impressively despite its seemingly limited range of inputs

53
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Before launching into this fantastic guitar solo

54
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And one that we definitely need a bit more of

55
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I haven't spoken about the lyrics because there's not too much to say

56
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
They're kicking ass and hey ho, who needs deep shit when you're kicking ass

57
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
There are a few songs that are definitely better than their brand

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Once again that's mainly because this video is quite personal to me

59
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
With that said it doesn't mean that songs can't be appreciated for their craftsmanship

60
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And this next one is definitely an example of that

61
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This song is an instrumental masterpiece

62
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Really integrating a lot of the oriental inspiration for this song

63
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
With very glossy yet fleshed out synthesizers

64
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
With this shimmering piano and smooth backing vocals

65
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And intermittent guitar work all composed together so well

66
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It really lends for a particularly lingering atmosphere

67
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
There's this constant state of musical evolution throughout this five minutes

68
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Going over musical bridges and transitions and so much more

69
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's really quite beautiful

70
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The song itself is about envy and how the artist would love to have the clout to tour the world

71
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's a personal message, maybe one that doesn't quite resonate with me

72
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Or with the mood of the song

73
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But I can still admire it nonetheless

74
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
As number 22 proved, I do place emphasis on a song's instrumental work

75
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I still prefer a complete piece even if some parts may be weaker on an individual basis

76
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
As contrast, number 21 proves incredibly strong in all categories

77
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Hence why it's just above Tokyo

78
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I mean, let's get something clear here

79
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The instrumental work is still fantastic

80
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You can never have too many guitar tones

81
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But the mood of this is much deeper

82
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Maybe too deep for some

83
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
As he cryptically and desperately searches for meanings and roots to his aforementioned pain

84
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It is brooding, it is thoughtful

85
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And it's interwoven with beautiful guitar work

86
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's all here

87
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I think I counted at least three different guitar solos

88
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The song just lets you slip away to it

89
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Without revealing too much

90
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It may not be a tearjoker

91
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But it is one that just stops you

92
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And leaves you in a very contemplative mood

93
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And for that, it's really quite special

94
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So, now the top 20, the tracks that we're always gonna beat here

95
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
This next track demonstrates how I value emotional resonance

96
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
As an important factor to how I enjoy a song

97
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Arguably not as complex as the previous songs

98
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But one that still touches me

99
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Nonetheless

100
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Ignore the part 2

101
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
They're both the same, just one without Kiara

102
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Though Kiara is what makes the difference in this instance

103
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The original wouldn't have made it

104
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
By providing a second perspective

105
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It lends the song to significantly more depth

106
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Than it has any right to have

107
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And gives us this tone about two lovers

108
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Reminiscing about their previous times together

109
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And despite the track intimacy that it provides

110
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You feel that they're not really talking face to face

111
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Juxtaposing the lyrical symmetry

112
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
With the contemplation that they may never reunite

113
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And that's a very bittersweet tone

114
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The song's composition, which is this soft synth guitar mix

115
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Really knows how to supplement the mood with that post-chorus drop

116
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Almost being this catharsis of emotion that both these people feel

117
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't know if it's what they went for

118
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But it worked

119
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So, props to them

120
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Most of these songs aren't ones that have been released in the last month

121
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Because normally I need some time to let them sink in

122
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
At the time of writing, this one was released in the last month

123
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Because as soon as I heard it, I knew it was making my list

124
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
One way or another

125
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:19,000
This song perfectly encapsulates the euphoria in an admittedly slightly unhealthy obsession

126
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But in a way, I think Gardner understands that

127
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
As these cascading synths and drums collapse around his quirky vocals

128
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You feel the joy and the turmoil of having feelings for someone

129
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
There's that sentiment that the recipient of this love

130
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
May never even be aware of themselves

131
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The desperation with lyrics such as

132
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But there's nothing else I can do

133
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And comparing this person to factors such as religion show that he is locked

134
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
As the synths fade away for one more percussive pre-chorus

135
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You feel his vocals bare and honest as they come

136
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
As he lays everything down one more time

137
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Some may say the overuse of the line

138
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I can't stop thinking about you is annoying

139
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And I understand that

140
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
However for me it's quite masterful because it perfectly reflects the tone and the lyrics in a way

141
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Making it catches all hell as well

142
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And pretty damn great

143
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I had a great year with some excellent albums from rappers who I hadn't paid too much of mind in the past

144
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Given the proportion of music that I listened to

145
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You won't find too much rap in these lists

146
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But when you do find it, you know it's good

147
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
A lot of people have been putting Temptation on the list

148
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And yes, that's definitely another fantastic song

149
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But I rooted for this one when it came down to The Wire

150
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And there are a few reasons for that

151
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Firstly, the production on this song is simply fabulous

152
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And it's not a style that I've heard too often as well

153
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Then you have the lyrics

154
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And it's not about the content itself, but it's the delivery

155
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Joey has moments towards the end of the second verse

156
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Where you feel like he is wearing his heart on his sleeve

157
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And we don't hear that enough in music

158
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's all so distant, yet here he's selling his emotions to us

159
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I feel like he is close to crying

160
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And that is powerful in my mind

161
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What finally pushes this song over the top

162
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Is the outro that feels like it was inserted to give the audience that moment for contemplation

163
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And I used every second

164
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's a song that I fully appreciate

165
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Some songs are just anthems

166
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And we need more anthems

167
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
On the first listen, I did not add this song to my favourites

168
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Heaven knows why

169
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But it's a hell of a good thing I came back to it

170
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
This is a song that is just required in a year of such depressing mainstream radio

171
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I have a respect for music that can make the normal sound incredible

172
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This song is about doing fuck all with a takeaway

173
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And the one you love

174
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But the lead sells it

175
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Partly thanks to the focus being more on togetherness

176
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But also due to the incredible instrumentation and melodic work

177
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Multiple guitar tones, harmonies

178
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
With the sheer pounding elation of a soaring chorus

179
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So desperately yearned for this year

180
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The Amazons did a fantastic job

181
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And this was not their only song that I absolutely loved this year

182
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
However this one was the best of the bunch

183
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
With its unique topic and sensational delivery

184
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
There is simply not much more that can be said

185
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Often there are a few songs that get lost in rotation throughout the year

186
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But upon re-listen, find themselves gradually moved up the list

187
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Until they hit a new high

188
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
This is a song that I had written off out of all the songs here

189
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And yet when I came back to it

190
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I realised that it was actually a priceless slice of musical gold

191
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
On the air shouting out that you're ready to change

192
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Ready to change

193
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You can say what you want

194
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The song opens with the vocalist cooing with real contempt

195
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
As tender but menacing pianos grow into this huge chorus

196
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
With propulsive hand claps and building drums

197
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Before throwing itself into this guitar and vocal driven drop

198
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
With the piano hanging over the mix

199
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Once again there's a real evolution

200
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Each chorus is unique

201
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Really giving a feeling of progress and building on the emotion

202
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
How many songs this year have just fucking died halfway through

203
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Or pulled away from a large chorus

204
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
This song pulls no punches

205
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
To sum up, this song is about someone who is a bit of a cunt

206
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But fucking hell, Kodaline frame it like they're bloody evil

207
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And I thought Liam Gallagher was brutal

208
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But the lead singer sounds legitimately angry

209
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And to be honest, if this was directed at me, I would not recover

210
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Fantastic track, check it out

211
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Sometimes there is a song that has no right to be as good as it is

212
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That despite its simple and humble beginnings

213
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Everything has just fallen into place

214
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
This is one of those

215
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Let me tell you who I am

216
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm your biggest fan

217
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Got your picture on my phone

218
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I got tickets to your show

219
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Girl let me tell you

220
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
This song is about someone who is using a very unique technique to pick up a girl

221
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
To the point of sounding slightly creepy to be honest

222
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It shouldn't work well, but it does

223
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And there is a reason for that

224
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Will Joseph Cook, he sells it

225
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
He is such a charismatic vocalist

226
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Effortlessly conveying the sentiment of dizzying infatuation

227
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You feel that it's out of an adorable naivety

228
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Rather than anything sinister thanks to that

229
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
This mood is only furthered by the infectious guitarist

230
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
That has sprinkled all over the song

231
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Some more acoustic, others more electric

232
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yet they blend together so fluently

233
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
All of this combined makes for a truly joyous song

234
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And one of the best of the year

235
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Great work Will, keep it up

236
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I think out of all the choices on this list

237
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
This is the corniest choice

238
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
In a year of rap geniuses such as

239
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Joyner Lucas, Kendrick Lamar, and Ty the Creator

240
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Gracing us with their presence

241
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Including this guy and not those

242
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Seems a bit of an insult

243
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But although I accept that they have made

244
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Objectively better songs, this is my list

245
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But still

246
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I just wanna be free

247
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Not a slave to the stereotype

248
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
All alone in my room in the middle of the night

249
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I don't have the words but my stereo mic

250
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I don't wanna be black, I don't wanna be white

251
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I just wanna be a man today

252
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I don't wanna be a

253
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Yes, I'm aware that Logic mentions

254
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
He's biracial too much

255
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yes, I'm aware the song has this weird

256
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Slowed down outro

257
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And yes, I'm aware the lyrics are corny as hell

258
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
But I just can't help myself

259
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I love this song

260
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
From the bright piano keys to

261
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Damien Lamar Hudson's beautiful vocal

262
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Performance over an interlude where he just

263
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Belts his lungs out

264
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's a song that lifts me up

265
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And as I said, the lyrics are corny

266
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But at least they promote a positive message for once

267
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
A message where you can be proud of your achievements

268
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Regardless of the qualities on face value

269
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
In a year swamped in negativity

270
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And stereotypes

271
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
This was actually kinda necessary and meaningful

272
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
To me

273
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And the fact that Logic can take a personal story

274
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And speak to the masses with it

275
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Is quite special in itself

276
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And looking in the comment section of the YouTube video

277
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It clearly reaches a lot of people

278
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm gonna defend its choice here

279
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Even though I accept that there may be other better ones

280
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Some songs are on this list because they're evocative

281
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Other songs are just too well made to ignore

282
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
However, this is one song that I can't really decide

283
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Which build that fits

284
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Maybe both

285
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I could rain

286
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Come and let me walk away

287
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I won't look back

288
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Geowolf made a masterpiece

289
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
This song's sweeping tone

290
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Leaves me in the same

291
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Contemplated mood every time

292
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The soft electric guitars blending effortlessly

293
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
With this excellent synth

294
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Which grow into the first verse

295
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
As the singer searches for a love among

296
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Before blooming into this beautiful chorus

297
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Where all the previous components come into play

298
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And she confronts her love and his indecision

299
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
With these shimmering synths in the second verse

300
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And this monumental bridge

301
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Where she realises that she might have found some closure

302
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
The production is undeniable in helping that

303
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And the lead singer could not be better suited to that production

304
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Her airy vocals floating over the mix

305
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Bathing in it without drowning in it

306
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
This song really is spotless

307
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Albeit a bit alien to me

308
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Amazing

309
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Keep it up

310
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Every year I'll find out about one or two artists

311
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That I think deserve to be the next big thing

312
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
This year there was only one of those

313
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Whose music I really consistently enjoyed

314
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And it was only right that he be included in this list

315
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Because there were plenty more songs of his to choose from

316
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Cause I believe in Karma

317
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And you believe in Karma

318
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You should try a little harder

319
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh Karma's gonna fall

320
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
As the stiff acoustic guitar line kicks in

321
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Over some very dry drum work

322
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Tom Walker sings aggravatively

323
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
About this naughty wench who's fucking around with him

324
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And as the pre-chorus creeps in

325
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
This swell of synths around you

326
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And you feel like something is going to happen

327
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
At a lot of points this year, nothing happens

328
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It just does this disappointing drop

329
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And you're left feeling like a fucking wet flannel

330
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And yet with Tom Walker, you get that payoff

331
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You get that massive chorus

332
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And it's so refreshing because Tom Walker has managed to understand the art of the climax

333
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
With all the instruments synchronizing perfectly behind Walker's voice in this chorus

334
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
To give it real gravitas

335
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Too many vocals have backed away from the chorus this year

336
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Walker is no coward

337
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The foreboding premise of Karma itself is pretty ingenious

338
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And definitely aids the very sinister tone

339
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And that final breakdown where Walker just lets loose on this girl

340
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'd just be as scared as her at that point

341
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You don't really know exactly what Walker's promising you

342
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
But that ambiguity plays into the particularly uneasy aura

343
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Menacing and brilliant truly masterful aspect of the song

344
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Truly fucking great, thank you for this

345
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Last year I placed my hood at the top of the year end list

346
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It was a song that spoke from personal perspective

347
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yet appealed to a general audience

348
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And that sort of juxtaposition of detail and universality always rivets me

349
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Particularly if the message is one that resonates

350
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
This year, that artist Ray BLK didn't quite hit those highs

351
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
But with the help of upcoming singer Dan Kaplan

352
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
She found her way back onto the list

353
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Living by the numbers cause you and me

354
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Go through it like the others

355
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And the highs don't feel the same

356
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And you still get drunk and flushed as rain

357
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
As I've said earlier this video

358
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
A song about mediocrities of life being made surprisingly pleasurable

359
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Is always appealing to someone like myself

360
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
As the hollow synths buzz in the background

361
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Kaplan's frothy baritone reflects on the unhealthy but gratifying lifestyle

362
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
That he and Ray BLK lead

363
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
As the stiff piano kicks in on the chorus

364
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
We hit that sour high that Kaplan is trying to project

365
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
The dysfunctional exhilaration

366
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Ray BLK fits perfectly to play that partner in crime

367
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
With the tender harmony on the second chorus

368
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
But let's face it

369
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
The reason that song is here

370
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Is because of the bridge

371
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
That fucking bridge

372
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
As the synths and piano mesh together

373
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
In this apocalyptic, alcoholic, infused chaos

374
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You realise that the protagonist

375
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
May never escape that state that they are in

376
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You feel the joy in the euphoria

377
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
As it all falls down around them

378
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And as the beat drops out

379
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You feel yourself drowning with them

380
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Before that final chorus

381
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
That is just the best culmination of the previous components

382
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's a great slice of contemporary music

383
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And more than enough reason

384
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
That the song finds itself here

385
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Halsey, an artist I never really got into

386
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And I'm not sure I ever truly will

387
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But on our last album

388
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
There was one song called Roman Holiday

389
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Which was simply sensational

390
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And it demonstrated a level of introspection

391
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Not shown in a lot of modern pop cuts

392
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't know if she'll ever hit that high again

393
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And her latest album left me fairly indifferent

394
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But damn, when she strikes gold

395
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
She strikes gold

396
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Said that we're not lovers

397
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
We're just strangers

398
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
With the same damn hunger

399
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Strangers is a hollow, hollow song

400
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
But from the industrial drum to the creeping synths

401
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It really creates a brooding atmosphere of mystique

402
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Which is well suited to this tune, must I add

403
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The chorus itself is like a controlled explosion

404
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It grows so much but stays so tight

405
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
With these Roman choir vocals dripping through the back of the mix

406
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It engulfs the listener

407
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Lauren Jauregui does a fantastic guest performance

408
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Adding a very nice tinge of soul to her part

409
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And the harmonisation on the choruses

410
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Create moments to behold

411
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
The context about the attempts to move on from a relationship

412
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And the passion that drives it

413
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Dealing with separation from something that's not working out

414
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
But still having to live with feelings that linger

415
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's a simple message but very powerfully done

416
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And the two person perspective definitely aids that

417
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Preventing it from sounding petty or creepy

418
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Fantastic song, check it out

419
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
There was a cut off this year

420
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
For songs that really emotionally moved me

421
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
These top 9 songs enter that new tier

422
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
A tier of emotional resonance for me personally

423
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Songs that I could sit down to and emote over

424
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
This next song is the only massive hit on the list

425
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And whereas many mainstream songs could wear out their welcome due to overplay

426
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
This one never got old

427
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And I miss the way you make me feel

428
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's real when we watch the sunset

429
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Over the castle only

430
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Castle on the Hill opens with soft guitar tones

431
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
As Ed Sheeran's voice reminisces over the energetic but slightly reserved beat

432
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
As the drums and haunting vocals kick in on the pre-chorus

433
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You feel the memories slowly returning

434
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And then what makes this song? The chorus

435
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
This truly euphoric moment

436
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Suddenly that soft guitar tone becomes the peak of a soaring mix

437
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
That captures so much raw emotion

438
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
With Ed putting in one of his greatest vocal performances to date

439
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
The joy and the pain

440
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And all these powerful emotions that seem to desert some of us into adulthood

441
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
There is a uniqueness in being young

442
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And the individual moments that we'll probably never be able to relive

443
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And Ed Sheeran understands that

444
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And then there's the bridge

445
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And the fucking bridge man

446
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Where there is this confrontation with the present

447
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And the moment that not everyone has fully realised what they want to be

448
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
That bittersweet moment is a borderline tearjerk for me

449
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
The framing is something special

450
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And although Ed Sheeran surprised me by selecting this as a single

451
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It was the best surprise possible

452
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Fantastic

453
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I've never really rated All Time Low too much

454
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
They have had some very good songs

455
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
But a lot of their music doesn't leave a huge impact on me

456
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Not bad by any means

457
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
But I wouldn't expect it to be putting it on my best list

458
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
So you know what this means

459
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
A contradiction

460
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
In many ways it makes sense to have this and cast on the hill back to back

461
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Because they are very similar in this sentiment

462
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
The mature singer reflecting on the days when they had that youth

463
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
The wish to return to better days

464
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I feel this song goes one step further than the previous

465
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Delving into the emotional psyche of the lead singer

466
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Addressing feelings of losing someone dear to you

467
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Denial a regret that you can't return to that time

468
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And then the resolve to accept that you have to grow up

469
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
The memories that you had with that person

470
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Trying to tell yourself it was never going to work out

471
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
But still considering the possibilities if it did

472
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
The final line of the song alters the auxiliary verb for one final twist

473
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And it's a nice little touch

474
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The production and melody is a real step up

475
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Really building up to this emotional high on the chorus

476
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
With this propulsive blend of guitar tones

477
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
With these liquid drums really pinning down a mix

478
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
That could have been too loose

479
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
The melody really lets the vocalist lay bare his feelings

480
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
While still retaining a lot of all time lows personality

481
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
That made them popular with the fans in the first place

482
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It's a song that finds maturity and age

483
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
But still finds themselves in a lot of the roots that they base themselves in

484
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It really disappoints me when I find an artist

485
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Who barely any viewers have heard of

486
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And for me it's so objectively clear how great they are

487
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
That I have to share

488
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And so with this next song it is one of those moments

489
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Princess in a castle you're a diva

490
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Everybody said that I should leave you

491
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Mood swing back in

492
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Sony's Princess tells us the simple story

493
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
About an entitled female who is draining Sony's mental

494
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
And maybe even physical resources

495
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
The song opens with these delicate drums

496
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And delicious layered vocals

497
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
With guitar work that would make angels cry

498
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Sony's melodic composition is on point

499
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
As he delivers intonations and inflections with ease

500
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And then the chorus just slides in

501
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
With all these components put together

502
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
And there are just these nice little tweaks

503
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
That could have been left out

504
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
But yet he chooses to insert

505
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And they enhance the mix so much more

506
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
The drum dropout at the start of the second verse

507
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
The organ line in the second chorus

508
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And the solo guitar that is just laced throughout the whole song

509
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
But really the cherry on the cake is Sony himself

510
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Who has an unassailable vocal presence

511
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It's really the performance of the year

512
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
There is no questioning that in my opinion

513
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
He had a heavy lumbering mix on the song

514
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And yet pulled it off with this beautiful performance

515
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
So complete credit to him

516
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
This is a great song and he made it happen

517
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
When writing up the shortlist for this

518
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I realised that I didn't have any grime songs

519
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It wasn't that there aren't any good ones out there

520
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
They just didn't make the cut this year

521
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I like my grime

522
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Last year I had Holy Grime by WALL-E

523
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And This Is England by Kano in my top 20

524
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
So in an attempt to see if I had missed any at all

525
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I listened once more to a few grime albums

526
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I didn't quite find a grime song

527
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
But I did find something

528
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I don't think I ever considered myself to be including a religious song

529
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Friends know that I'm fairly cynical towards religion

530
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
But unlike a lot of tunes this doesn't speak down to the listener

531
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
You feel like Stormzy is standing right beside you as he presents this

532
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And it fortunately leans more on the spiritual side without being preachy

533
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
He is thanking God but I honestly couldn't care

534
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
He just sounds so grateful, so likeable, so genuine

535
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
It reaches out to anyone who hopes they can be lifted up with or without celestial means

536
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
The organ swell, the touch of the guitar

537
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And Jesus Christ, MNEK's vocalisation and harmonies are unbelievable

538
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
He is on a completely different level in this song

539
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And I'll tell you this much, the idea of God may not be one that I have in my heart

540
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
But the idea of thankfulness, for the support when all seems lost

541
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Yeah I feel that, so thank you Stormzy for this song

542
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So when Tom Walker released Karma earlier this year

543
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I thought to myself, what a great tune

544
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
This is easily his best all year

545
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Tom Walker, not to be outdone, decided to release another song

546
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And fucking hell

547
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I will leave the light on

548
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
It's crazy that we have to rely on indie artists for the best drops these days

549
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
The chiming synths hit like a ton of bricks

550
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
As Tom Walker roars with passion that no man can match

551
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
The song itself is essentially an open letter to a friend

552
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Who is going through a hard time and turning to drug abuse

553
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
It's a dark topic but like the lighthouse that Tom Walker has set up

554
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
There is still a shred of hope

555
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
The soft piano building on the chorus is sentimental and potent

556
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And the bridge where you feel that desperation in his voice and lyrics building

557
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
That he knows that his friend is in danger but he still refuses to give up

558
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
The determination of that is brilliant

559
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
The sheer belief and faith in Walker's delivery is truly outstanding

560
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It sounds like he's been there and he sells it like he has

561
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
And I would say more but I don't know what to say

562
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
You just have to check it out for yourself

563
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It is sensational

564
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I love it when a band can take elements of the old and integrate them with the new

565
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
That's what Def Havana did this year

566
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And I give them a lot of credit for it

567
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
They really transformed music to me

568
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
But to go one step beyond and make a damn masterpiece

569
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
They didn't have to but they fucking did

570
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
When my lungs collapse and my heart turns black

571
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I'll bring my ashes to the cold

572
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
When actually writing this script I was listening to the songs

573
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
To make sure that I was getting all the points down

574
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And this is where the emotions really did get the better of me

575
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
But I think I can keep it composed without the musical accompaniment here

576
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
In this song the lead vocalist deals with issues of isolation, depression, separation

577
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And returning to the places of foregone memories to try and cleanse yourself of those feelings

578
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
The lyrics utilise anecdotes and metaphors to tell a story with incredible poetic depth

579
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
The singer goes through these issues systematically in the verses

580
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Utilising an acoustic guitar before exploding into a huge chorus with bittersweet emotional highs

581
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
It is a moment of real musical transcendence

582
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
The piano bridge after the first verse is a great touch as well

583
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And just when I thought I couldn't top all these swelling emotions

584
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
The bridge comes in and he confronts what he has lost as he sings

585
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
If I could find the legs to stand on or something

586
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Maybe I could take control of my own life

587
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You realise that he may never get that closure that he yearns for

588
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Because he hasn't truly realised a problem

589
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And then it just launches into this huge instrumental break

590
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
That just tries me every time

591
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
This song is brilliant

592
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
There's nothing more to be said

593
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
John Mayer

594
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I don't know what the fuck happened

595
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
He's here

596
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
And what about this feeling

597
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
That I'm never good enough

598
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Will it wash out in the water

599
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Or is it always in the blood

600
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Yes, John Mayer is an incredibly talented person

601
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
But his music never really had much of an effect on me

602
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
That was until mid 2017 when I heard this cut and dam

603
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
In this song, Mayer addresses a lot of his insecurities

604
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And poses the ever important question of nature or nurture

605
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
The interesting thing is that a lot of his questions don't have clear answers

606
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Are a lot of the feelings we have innate or can we circumvent them for the better of our health

607
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
This framing is particularly important

608
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
As it's quite rare that we have an artist frame himself with that much equivocation

609
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
In a way enacting a double blind because he's not even truly aware of the answer himself

610
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
All of this presented over some of the best production work in his career

611
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Originating with the acoustic guitar

612
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
The slow introduction of more and more guitars throughout the mix

613
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Is such a fantastic touch

614
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
It takes it in new directions every time

615
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And all topped off with an appropriately soft

616
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
But an appropriately beautifully breezy guitar solo

617
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Which just elevates the song more and more

618
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
It is easy going, it is John Mayer

619
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
But it's still emotionally very resonant

620
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Honestly it is a brilliant tune

621
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And I am so happy that it's here

622
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And I'm so happy that John Mayer made it happen

623
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Lorde had a commercially disappointing year

624
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
But it didn't prevent her from putting out a pretty damn great album

625
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Now a lot of critics chose to insert Greenlight or Liability

626
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Which are very strong songs as well

627
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
But I had to go for something a bit more personal

628
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
The song Perfect Places is about emotional catharsis

629
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Through partying, alcohol and dubious substances

630
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
As emotional highs are becoming harder to find

631
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
She searches more and more desperately

632
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Romantic things like kissing and taking off clothes

633
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Are resigned to be mere functions

634
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
As the hollow drums pound in the background

635
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And we reach the final outro with Lorde questioning the existence

636
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Of these Perfect Places over these monumental synthesizer tones

637
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
We realise that Lorde has come full circle

638
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And that everywhere she searches for those Perfect Places

639
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
All of the new highs lose their novelty

640
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And no longer fulfil what was desired

641
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
That is one powerful message

642
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
The synth swell and melodic delivery in the chorus

643
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Really highlight the double edged sword of the message

644
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
You feel the joy but you also feel a lot of the turmoil

645
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
The slight push on Lorde's vocals

646
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
As she herself reaches in vain to find the highs

647
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Among an assumedly depressing existence

648
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It is a tragedy, but one of the most poignant of that

649
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Perfect Places is a beautiful cut of Lorde's album

650
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
The troublesome messages dealt with and addressed in such a nuanced way

651
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It is really admirable, fantastic

652
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I don't know what to say, check it out

653
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
For those who know me well, you'll likely know that my 2017 wasn't the easiest of years

654
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I had a lot of things that just seemed to turn against me when I least needed them

655
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Times have been challenging, but with the faith of many people close to me

656
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I managed to stay afloat

657
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Music is part of that, so these songs reflect me and who I am in many ways

658
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And sometimes you don't need a bohemian rhapsody to speak the world to you

659
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Sometimes the right song can come along and reach out to you

660
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
A mix of being personal enough and yet still being masterful about what it aims to achieve

661
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
So without further ado, here's your number one

662
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
The messages that the song Brother promotes are the sort of messages that keep me going

663
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
In the face of adversity, it's a simple message, but it's done so brilliantly

664
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
From the steel pan riff that opens up and anchors a lot of the song

665
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
To the sensitive vocals that address people going through hard times

666
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
To keep your head up over these soft, tropical synths that just envelop you

667
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
The washed out guitar fluttering over the back of the mix

668
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Combined with the repetition of the aforementioned phrase

669
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Make it a real compositional masterpiece

670
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It's identifiable, it's unique, but it's still general in its address

671
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
There's this acknowledgement that it may not be working out

672
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And it may not all just tie up immediately

673
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
But as they plead with the listener to carry on in spite of what's pulling them down

674
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
And they try to convey the hope of what they know may not be there

675
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
You feel it

676
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I feel it

677
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And that is for sure what really made this one reach out to me like no other song truly did

678
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
That's why it is here

679
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Keeping your head up is not just about persevering and not letting yourself drown

680
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It is about pride

681
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
It's about dignity

682
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
It's about loving yourself in spite of your own doubts

683
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Brother is a lot deeper than it looks

684
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Much like a lot of the water that we often find ourselves thrown into

685
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
The most important message from Brother is that it may be shit now

686
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
But it can get better

687
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And I want to pass that message on to anyone going through tough times right now

688
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It may be hard currently

689
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You may feel the strain, the burden that life sometimes weighs us down with

690
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
But you're never alone

691
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And you don't ever have to think you're alone

692
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And if you ever do feel alone

693
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Drop me a line

694
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I'm always on Twitter

695
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I'm always on Discord

696
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
No one's ever that far

697
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
2017 could have been better for a lot of us

698
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Let's try and make 2018

699
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
A slight improvement

700
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Anyway, I would love to hear your thoughts on what you believed were the best tunes

701
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
After all, my opinion is just one of many

702
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I'm The Right Opinion

703
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
And I'll see you in the next one
