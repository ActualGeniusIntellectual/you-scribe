0	1000	Oh snap.
1000	9780	Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the hove twat with too much
9780	10780	free time.
10780	12720	And there's a snap general election.
12720	13720	Get in.
13720	17480	So if anybody across the pond or in any other countries hasn't paid attention, Prime Minister
17480	20640	Theresa May just called an election, and the hypest hype has occurred.
20640	23060	But first let's look at why she would have done this.
23060	25960	Because I have no life, I've spent the last few months following the polling for the British
25960	27980	government, eagerly looking at the trend.
27980	30960	Now when a Prime Minister is elected, there is a time known as the honeymoon period, which
30960	34660	is when an individual is expected to be particularly popular with the public, just for the case
34660	36100	of being a fresh impression.
36100	40100	Theresa May has rode out this supposed honeymoon period and seen through fiscal policy changes
40100	43500	and other world events, and her popularity is still buzzing.
43500	46740	And now she feels that due to the fact that the honeymoon period is statistically over
46740	50400	and she's still destroying her opponents in the polls, that it is a good time to host
50400	51660	a general election.
51660	53380	It's common sense, in a way.
53380	56920	It allows her to debunk the criticism of her being an unelected Prime Minister, and it
56920	59880	also allows her to put her Brexit policy to the test.
59880	63960	And I think this is sensible too, a lot has changed since the 2015 election, and policies
63960	67960	of the manifesto that were presented then did not address how the UK will approach Brexit
67960	69060	with good detail.
69060	72640	In hindsight now, it's clear how arrogant David Cameron was in thinking that Britain
72640	76480	wouldn't vote leave, because if he actually entertained it in his mind as a genuine possibility,
76480	80280	it probably would have been given more attention in his lovely little blue booklet.
80280	84020	So I'm generally in favour of a general election, and although some people are rolling their
84020	88900	eyes at this point and thinking, fuck me, another one, I revel at them, I bathe in them,
88900	90820	I eat them for breakfast.
90820	94380	The other good thing is seeing the back of twats like George Osborne, who will now go
94380	98940	on to be a cunt in the mainstream media, how I love self-fulfilling prophecies.
98940	102780	Speaking of the mainstream media, I see that Theresa is going to crush the saboteurs with
102780	103780	blue murder.
103780	108540	How I love unbiased reporting, bringing this country together every time.
108540	112440	Now I'm sure people will wonder who I'm voting for, well, I'm currently undecided, either
112440	117160	I side with a party that I generally agree with but disagree with on Brexit, or I side
117160	121000	with a party who I agree with on Brexit and disagree with on other matters, and also I
121000	125400	have to take into account that I absolutely loathe my member of parliament, I genuinely
125400	127320	thought to myself I could never vote for her.
127320	131220	But to sum up, I'm not considering any other parties right now, unfortunately they're either
131220	135180	not a presence where I live, or I just don't think they're suited to be in number 10.
135180	138680	The plan is that I'm going to wait for other manifestos to appear, analyse them on the
138680	142640	some of their parts, hopefully watch some of the TV debates, and make a fair, balanced
142640	143640	judgement.
143640	147500	On the topic of TV debates, Theresa May has refused to appear in them, which is fantastic
147500	150640	as always, not gonna lie, a bit miffed about that one.
150640	155040	TV debates are the honourable thing to do, and it often does help people assess the credibility
155040	159280	of a politician as the prime minister, and even if it is tactical, I always find it a
159280	160280	bit cowardly.
160280	163780	If they can't stand on a podium for 60 minutes and argue their cause, how can they convince
163780	166280	me that they're fit to run the country for 5 years?
166280	169760	All in all, whatever happens over the next few months, it will hopefully not be too much
169760	174040	of an open and shut case, because although Theresa is trouncing home right now, anything
174040	178240	can happen in politics, and there could be some little plots brooding under the surface.
178240	182000	She now has to prove herself as a campaigner, and someone who can convince me and the public
182000	185440	that her vision of Britain is the best and most deliverable one.
185440	189480	I'm The Right Opinion, and will June be the end of May?
189480	190680	Probably not, but we'll see.
