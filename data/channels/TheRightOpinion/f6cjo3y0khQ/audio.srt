1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Oh snap.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,780
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the hove twat with too much

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,780
free time.

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,720
And there's a snap general election.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,720
Get in.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,480
So if anybody across the pond or in any other countries hasn't paid attention, Prime Minister

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,640
Theresa May just called an election, and the hypest hype has occurred.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,060
But first let's look at why she would have done this.

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,960
Because I have no life, I've spent the last few months following the polling for the British

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,980
government, eagerly looking at the trend.

11
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,960
Now when a Prime Minister is elected, there is a time known as the honeymoon period, which

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,660
is when an individual is expected to be particularly popular with the public, just for the case

13
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,100
of being a fresh impression.

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,100
Theresa May has rode out this supposed honeymoon period and seen through fiscal policy changes

15
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,500
and other world events, and her popularity is still buzzing.

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,740
And now she feels that due to the fact that the honeymoon period is statistically over

17
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,400
and she's still destroying her opponents in the polls, that it is a good time to host

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,660
a general election.

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,380
It's common sense, in a way.

20
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,920
It allows her to debunk the criticism of her being an unelected Prime Minister, and it

21
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,880
also allows her to put her Brexit policy to the test.

22
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,960
And I think this is sensible too, a lot has changed since the 2015 election, and policies

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,960
of the manifesto that were presented then did not address how the UK will approach Brexit

24
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,060
with good detail.

25
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,640
In hindsight now, it's clear how arrogant David Cameron was in thinking that Britain

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,480
wouldn't vote leave, because if he actually entertained it in his mind as a genuine possibility,

27
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,280
it probably would have been given more attention in his lovely little blue booklet.

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,020
So I'm generally in favour of a general election, and although some people are rolling their

29
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,900
eyes at this point and thinking, fuck me, another one, I revel at them, I bathe in them,

30
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,820
I eat them for breakfast.

31
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,380
The other good thing is seeing the back of twats like George Osborne, who will now go

32
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,940
on to be a cunt in the mainstream media, how I love self-fulfilling prophecies.

33
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,780
Speaking of the mainstream media, I see that Theresa is going to crush the saboteurs with

34
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,780
blue murder.

35
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,540
How I love unbiased reporting, bringing this country together every time.

36
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,440
Now I'm sure people will wonder who I'm voting for, well, I'm currently undecided, either

37
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:57,160
I side with a party that I generally agree with but disagree with on Brexit, or I side

38
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,000
with a party who I agree with on Brexit and disagree with on other matters, and also I

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,400
have to take into account that I absolutely loathe my member of parliament, I genuinely

40
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,320
thought to myself I could never vote for her.

41
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,220
But to sum up, I'm not considering any other parties right now, unfortunately they're either

42
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,180
not a presence where I live, or I just don't think they're suited to be in number 10.

43
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,680
The plan is that I'm going to wait for other manifestos to appear, analyse them on the

44
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,640
some of their parts, hopefully watch some of the TV debates, and make a fair, balanced

45
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,640
judgement.

46
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,500
On the topic of TV debates, Theresa May has refused to appear in them, which is fantastic

47
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,640
as always, not gonna lie, a bit miffed about that one.

48
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,040
TV debates are the honourable thing to do, and it often does help people assess the credibility

49
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,280
of a politician as the prime minister, and even if it is tactical, I always find it a

50
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,280
bit cowardly.

51
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,780
If they can't stand on a podium for 60 minutes and argue their cause, how can they convince

52
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,280
me that they're fit to run the country for 5 years?

53
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,760
All in all, whatever happens over the next few months, it will hopefully not be too much

54
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,040
of an open and shut case, because although Theresa is trouncing home right now, anything

55
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,240
can happen in politics, and there could be some little plots brooding under the surface.

56
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,000
She now has to prove herself as a campaigner, and someone who can convince me and the public

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,440
that her vision of Britain is the best and most deliverable one.

58
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,480
I'm The Right Opinion, and will June be the end of May?

59
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,680
Probably not, but we'll see.
