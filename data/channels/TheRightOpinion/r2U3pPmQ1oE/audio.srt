00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Hey you guys, welcome to today's video. Obviously from the title you know that this is going to be

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
intense,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
different,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,540
and this is absolutely not a video I ever thought in a million years that I would be making.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And who said internet drama was boring?

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Well, many people.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But let's face it, not too much has happened this year.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And the usual suspects such as Jake Paul have just appeared to fade into the background.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
As people finally tire from having to expose them for whatever stupid thing they've done this month.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And it's not like they've stopped doing stupid stuff, it's Jake Paul.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But we want new drama, some new people to ruin.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Hooray! We love that, that's the spirit.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So let's talk about the beauty community.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
In 2018 I made a video on the beauty community.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It wasn't perfect, I mean no video truly is.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But one of the greatest points that I raised was that they were kind of taking over a significant proportion of drama from previous communities.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And with the rise of the beauty oriented drama channels to really embellish on that niche,

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
it only meant that subsequent dramas were going to gain more traction.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But why do so many people seem to care about the drama in this specific community on principle?

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Is it because it's a lot equivalent to the sort of drama you get in a cliche TV show based on high school experience?

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah, in fact everyone's always throwing shade at each other and that makes it a bit entertaining.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Equally they all purport to have this goody two shoes persona, it's always like some moral battle.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So when someone does do something that we perceive as shitty, we're ready to drag them out onto the dance floor.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Now what makes a drama somewhat seismic in its impact?

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Many people would say to the point that it invokes a loss of subscribers onto a channel,

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and to be honest we haven't really seen that much this year.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But like Waiting For Buses, two came along at once, Pro Jared and James Charles.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Now as I declared in my tweet, I'm still very interested in the Pro Jared situation,

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
but it seems that at the time, he hid behind the wave of outrage against James Charles.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Let's make it so the tide doesn't leave him at the shore.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Either way, I'm hoping that there's still more to come on this situation, so I decided to focus on today's.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The beauty community, for all its makeup, has some real savagery lying underneath,

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and we witnessed that last year when Jeffree Star got into drama with a few people,

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and most notoriously Manny Mue and Laura Lee,

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and when the court of public opinion came out in favour of Star,

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
damage was dealt that can still be witnessed to this day.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The beauty community is truly brutal, a cheeky expose or well placed drama can destroy anyone,

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and the effects are long term, you don't see that in many other places.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So I saw that today's subject, James Charles, was experiencing a decrease in subscribers of unprecedented amounts.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well it didn't surprise me looking at how cutthroat the beauty community has the capability to be,

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
but even with that said, it's more than that.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
James Charles is not just any ordinary beauty creator.

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,000
In fact it was so fun and so fresh, drum roll please, that we decided to do it all summer long.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
James Charles is the 19 year old lad on whatever number of subscribers he's on at the time of this video's release,

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
but for the last few months he's been a huge name in the beauty community, for better and for worse.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
On one hand, his personality, although not my cup of tea, no pun intended, is pretty memorable.

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
He has a great way of establishing hooks, especially with the phrase Sister,

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
which at this point I'm surprised his management haven't Sister trademarked it.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
He's a creative, flamboyant guy with a lot of going for him.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Like every channel, he's got into a bit of drama here and there,

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
but nothing prominent enough to really gain attention outside the people who were already seeking drama.

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And as mentioned, drama for beauty channels is pretty much a daily event,

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
that's the problem with drama sometimes, it becomes so common that no one is honestly surprised by it

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and therefore it lacks any greater effect.

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This changed however, on the 10th of May, when Tati Westbrook, another beauty creator,

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
dropped a video by the name of By Sister, a play on James' iconic phrase,

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
in which she documents why, in spite of her extensive history supporting and working with him,

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
she no longer wants to associate with him.

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
These entail a series of criticisms that relate back to the way he has treated his friends,

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
his inappropriate behaviour at certain events,

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
the fact that he promoted a brand that would be sensitive to younger children,

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
in spite of the fact that he has said to Tati that he wouldn't promote hers due to the age of his demographic,

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and the real kicker that everyone has honed in on, his predatory behaviour,

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
for which he has a strange obsession with chasing and supposedly trying to persuade straight men to sleep with him.

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
All this, when presented in a very classy, mature tone that Tati seems to emanate all over her work,

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
was enough not just to completely halt all of James Charles' momentum,

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
but to cause the greatest sub-loss in YouTube's history.

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
In fact, in one day he lost over a million subscribers, which is astonishing.

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Following this, it was like the dam had broken, and a flurry of allegations came crashing down on him,

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
many alleging that he had a habit of catfishing and manipulating straight guys into various positions,

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
metaphorical positions that is.

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
On top of this, a load of further accusations from a various range of sources came forward,

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
some more true than others, but they all received incredible levels of attention.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
However, like anything, there will always follow backlash, and like this again,

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
many people came forward to dispute many things, some the verifiability of the claims,

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
some Tati's own motivations, and refrain from speaking out sooner,

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I mean, PewDiePie made a video covering all of this.

79
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
On top of this, it was revealed that some additional claims have been completely falsified,

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
thus leading to more collateral drama relating back to James' career.

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Now on one hand, I was pleased, I was one step closer to becoming the most subscribed gay James on the platform,

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
on the other, I felt there was a bit more to the story,

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
so I put out a tweet asking people if they had any opinions themselves,

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and what they wanted me to look into and discuss,

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
because although I had my own line, there is still a lot to clear up,

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and although I do have one clear statement in mind,

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
today I will be covering all of these topics,

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and explaining why I personally believe this situation was inevitable,

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
exactly why this detail is very important,

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and why it has created many more problems in regards to our own judgement of the situation,

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and how this was exposed when James finally did come forward.

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I don't think I really have too much else to add,

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
so I suggest we move in and see exactly what I mean.

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
One of the hot takes circulating around Twitter currently,

95
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
is with all the drama that James Charles has been involved in,

96
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
why was it this one that should have taken him down?

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Is it just because straight people are looking to reinforce their fears against the scary gays?

98
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Especially when throughout the last few years,

99
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
James Charles has supposedly been involved in multiple scandals with various people and various allegations,

100
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I mean he really did have to catch them all,

101
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
racism, transphobia, inappropriate comments towards others, and alleged exploitation of fans.

102
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
With this all in mind, guys, why wasn't he cancelled immediately?

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Was it because if James Charles came to a house with Ben Shapiro in blackface,

104
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
the Heteros would be more concerned about Ben Shapiro's safety?

105
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
As hilarious as that thought would be,

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and I'm not suggesting it's completely after the question,

107
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
it's not exactly the case.

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You see, the devil's in the details.

109
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The way we can understand these previous dramas

110
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
is actually as strong foundations for why people were so ready to turn on James Charles when the time came.

111
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So let's look at them, explain why they contributed to the scenario,

112
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
but why he ultimately got away from them.

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
James Charles is an impulsive person.

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't think that statement is remotely controversial.

115
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
In many ways, that is what made him so monumentally popular.

116
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
His speed of conversation and energy during videos really enhances his charisma in many ways.

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
However, equally it means that he does not have a filter.

118
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Many like to envision their favourite creators as just only thinking lovely, wholesome thoughts throughout their career,

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
but that's a load of bullshit.

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The truth is, you can think of anything at any time.

121
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The most twisted, broken, and often offensive thoughts that you keep inside your twisted mind

122
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
to satisfy that craving of darkness that many have.

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The problem is, most public figures know exactly how many of those thoughts would be received if they decide to say it out loud.

124
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
James Charles probably has some level of that,

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
but clearly lacks the judgement that other figures in the beauty community have,

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and that can be found in many tweets and even videos,

127
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
even ones that aren't inherently offensive,

128
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
which is why he often says stuff and then deletes it 10 minutes later,

129
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,000
because the emotional flashbang that went off in his head telling him publicly airing his dirty laundry was a great idea,

130
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
suddenly didn't seem such a fantastic initiative.

131
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
However, his greatest weakness is also his greatest defence,

132
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
because a lot of times it'll retract a comment very quickly and apologise from the bottom of his heart.

133
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And a lot of people don't like to go after people who've apologised and pledged to do better,

134
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
because an apology is meant to be a resolution.

135
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The only time we might pursue it further is if we feel the apology isn't genuine,

136
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and therefore we think they'll keep up these habits.

137
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,000
A lot of people didn't want to be seen as just continuously dragging someone out over stuff that they'd already apologised for.

138
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
However, it did build a lot of resentment in people who have their suspicions about his intentions,

139
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
and probably gave people an impetus to really come down on him when these videos inevitably came.

140
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So what needed to change about these scandals that would suddenly bring him down?

141
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I mean all the stuff that had happened hadn't slowed his momentum.

142
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Another thing was because the main scandals weren't too frequent,

143
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
they'd often happen with some time between them,

144
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
it never really had the capacity to snowball because it kinda happened in brief spurts of interest,

145
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
rather than one continuous ongoing scenario,

146
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and although there were people with clear vendettas against him,

147
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
they're not going to be the ones subscribed to him.

148
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Now, when various scandals arise, the biggest problem with public response is that it often takes the form of many different narratives,

149
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
so if we take James Charles' tweets, for example the one about Ebola,

150
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
some may say, this proves James Charles is a racist and should be cancelled,

151
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
others might say, well I don't think he's a racist and shouldn't be cancelled, but he should apologise.

152
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And because of this dissent within the group of critics, you're going to have trouble outshining James Charles' response,

153
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
because he'll present one narrative that represents his mindset.

154
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's like party politics, and in a way it's not an inherently unhealthy thing,

155
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
but James Charles will present his perspective, and with all that momentum behind him,

156
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
he's going to get the backing of people who want to believe he's an impulsive lad who just can't think straight sometimes.

157
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Essentially, if James Charles was going to actually have a wake up call, you'd need one person to bring a singular narrative forward.

158
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Infiltration had to come from the inside, and that could only come from a creator not just in the beauty community,

159
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
but one with experience, and one with respect, the sort of figure who has the power to giveth and taketh away.

160
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Also, given the closure on a lot of these previous incidents, a person who calls them out would also have to be typically calling them out for new drama,

161
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
or drama that at least James Charles hadn't personally addressed or faced down any consequences for.

162
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This is where we introduce Tati Westbrook.

163
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Tati Westbrook is one of the most senior creators in the beauty community.

164
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
She's 37 years of age, and owner of the company Halo Beauty, which sells products related to skin, hair and nail treatment primarily.

165
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
As someone with a few more years on her, she definitely comes across with a bit more dignity than most.

166
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
She also has an extensive history of working with James Charles, and a constant run of promoting his products and supporting him,

167
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
so it's very likely there is a significant overlap in audiences between the two creators.

168
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
This is an important point to note.

169
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
People like ImAlexx and so on can call out James Charles any day of the week.

170
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It won't have a huge effect, because firstly as a perceived outsider, these creators carry less credibility in their experience,

171
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and secondly, there's just not the same overlap in audience that can cause an exodus from James' channel.

172
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
All of these factors make Tati an important puzzle piece.

173
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But what was the fresh drama?

174
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Well, there's this event called Coachella.

175
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,000
This is a pretty popular music festival that is attended by many icons, and when James got there, shock horror, he needed security.

176
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Who would have thought, but do not fear, a company by the name of Sugar Bear Hair had a contract,

177
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and would help them out, if he could promote their fantastic product.

178
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So he did, but Sugar Bear Hair is a primary competitor of Halo Beauty,

179
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and Tati felt upset by this, so she posted a story to her Instagram explaining her upset,

180
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
and although not calling him out, pretty much implying that she was talking about James.

181
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
James seeing this after the expiration of his promotion posted a public response stating that he was sorry to Tati,

182
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and wasn't thinking about it at the time, very typical James Charles.

183
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So the drama's over, right? Right? Wrong.

184
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Intense, different, and this is absolutely not a video I ever thought in a million years that I would be making.

185
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You see, in many ways, there were many people ready to pounce on a significant anti-James Charles story,

186
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
there have been people discussing it for ages, but only Tati Westbrook could make it the perfect storm of destruction.

187
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Whether that was her intention, I cannot say, I think it would have been hard to foresee such an outcome,

188
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
but it's what happened, and it was enabled by all the previous factors considered.

189
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
However, with that said, a good exposed video would still require a careful sensitivity about it.

190
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
However, using the templates of last year's drama, you could identify what works, not being over-emotional.

191
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm so sorry, Yuka. I'm so sorry for disappointing you. It hurts me so bad.

192
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Establishing credibility not just as a person with experience, but also a person with positive intent.

193
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
There's something about him that I just adore and love, and he'll grow out of this, and he'll mature,

194
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and I want to be someone that can give him solid advice, and there's something in my heart that is pulled to him,

195
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
and I love him, and I am there for this kid through and through, and I really have been,

196
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
and there's so much that you guys don't know.

197
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm providing a valid set of reasons for why you're doing what you're doing.

198
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And I'm going to share a lot of it with you, because I feel at this point that I have to,

199
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
because Gabriel Zamora decided to drag me out on the dance floor by calling me out by name

200
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
in a video that he made about opinions and makeup.

201
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Now as tonal presentation goes, it's really a masterstroke in every area.

202
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Tati seems calm, but not disinterested.

203
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's a video that carries a lot of dignity, and exactly what Charles' critics would have wanted in harming his reputation.

204
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Of course, there was very little actual evidence, but circumstantially, to a community, everything added up.

205
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
When taking someone down, the key is to undermine their redeemability.

206
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
This is dispatched very early on in the first few minutes by Tati, who presents herself as one of the people

207
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
who has openly defended James Charles, and given him multiple opportunities to redeem himself.

208
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And for someone that I helped when no one would, asking for absolutely nothing in return,

209
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
never asking for a payback, never asking for a dime, any of the deals that were structured,

210
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
if anyone ever offered a kickback, we'd say no, put it in James' pocket, help James, help him.

211
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You know, any time I had an opportunity to help him make money, I would.

212
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
If I could give him advice, I did. If he needed a safe landing, I was here.

213
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I have so much empathy for people, and I really want to see people grow and step into themselves,

214
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
and I'm more the person to ask, like, well, what made you feel that you needed to do XYZ?

215
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Like, what happened to you, or like, why do you feel like you need to do that?

216
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I can't be the person to point and write people off very quickly.

217
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Like, it takes a lot for me to really want to not be associated with someone,

218
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:30,000
and so I've always had a really forgiving heart, because I know to get here, I've required a lot of forgiveness myself.

219
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
If we believe someone can get better, then we're more likely to forgive them.

220
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
However, there's a point of no return where that tolerance is broken.

221
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
By presenting herself as one of Charles' biggest defenders, she also made her attack all the more damaging,

222
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and the way she expresses herself is extremely relatable.

223
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I have many people who I know I've taken the sort of wise man figure in,

224
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
even though I think they've probably done some really stupid shit.

225
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Many of us believe in people's capability to get better, especially when it's our friends,

226
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
and Tati clearly shows herself as a friend who has just lost that tolerance.

227
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,000
With the new drama, she had fresh allegations to show that he's been behaving in the same way that he has been,

228
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
and importantly, she focuses on the responses, and therefore underlines the redundancy of them.

229
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Things were said that I cannot unhear at my dining room table. I cannot unhear it.

230
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,000
When I confronted him on it, he cried, he apologised, and you need someone to tell you to stop it.

231
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And that's exactly what I did in your kitchen in front of Gabriel Zamora.

232
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I had to call every one of them up the next morning and apologise on your behalf because it was so uncomfortable.

233
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And I've continued to do that, but it's just all kind of stacking up right now like this.

234
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
She essentially makes it so if he apologises, it no longer carries the effect that previous apologies had

235
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
because people are sceptical of the genuine sentiments behind it,

236
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
because Tati is testifying that he did the same thing to her.

237
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It was about image protection rather than actually feeling bad.

238
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So with that line of defence, Tati went in with serious allegations.

239
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Oh my god, you tried to trick a straight man into thinking he's gay yet again,

240
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
and somehow you're the victim.

241
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You know, it's really disgusting to manipulate someone's sexuality,

242
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
especially when they are still emerging into adulthood and don't quite have everything figured out.

243
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You are using your fame, your power, your money to play with people's emotions,

244
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
you're threatening to ruin them, you're threatening to embarrass them,

245
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
and you're doing that to have them behave sexually in your favour, even if they're straight,

246
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
and you know what, that's not okay.

247
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Now there were a fair few claims, but I thought we'd focus in on one primarily,

248
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
because this has been the source of the most controversy.

249
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
In a video that was later posted by the waiter in question, he states that he was quote bi-curious,

250
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
but after the engagement felt like he was straight.

251
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
On one hand, this doesn't completely reflect Westbrook's retelling of the story,

252
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
but on the other hand, the DMs the waiter showed clearly demonstrated a coercive side of Charles,

253
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
telling this person he wasn't actually straight, even if it does come across as more desperate than anything.

254
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Charles was definitely the assertive one in this scenario, and also the one with significant amount of power,

255
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
and James' retelling of the event doesn't quite reflect the DMs either.

256
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I was travelling, and I met a really, really beautiful boy at a restaurant,

257
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
and we caught each other's eye, and I didn't think anything of it,

258
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
the wait staff was like harassing him because they saw that I kept looking at him and stuff,

259
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
and the next day, he had DMed me on Instagram, and he was like,

260
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
oh my god I noticed you last night, I thought you were really beautiful,

261
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
and I was like, oh my god can I ask, are you straight?

262
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And he was like, no I'm bi.

263
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
So he, right away, told me he was bi.

264
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And I did, we can throw the screen shot up here somewhere.

265
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
At that time, I was bi-curious.

266
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
He's literally like, hey I just want to let you know I'm really grateful for everything you helped me with,

267
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I actually just came out to my mom last night and told her that I was bi, so thank you so much.

268
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And so she was super, super supportive, and I told her that I wanted to come visit you,

269
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
and I've thought about it a lot, and I have talked to her, and I actually think that I am straight, so I'm not gonna come.

270
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I was pretty sure I was straight.

271
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
So I told him in a long text message that I am straight.

272
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
With all this in mind, Tati continues to recall situations in which James behaved improperly,

273
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and then recalls the most recent situation over Sugar Bear.

274
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Are you kidding me? A, you say you don't like this brand at all, and that it would be embarrassing.

275
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So like stick with that, like stick to what you speak, practice what you preach.

276
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You say that you're the realist, you can't be bought, well you just were.

277
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I don't think you were in a dangerous situation, I really, really don't.

278
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You know fair well how crowds are, so if you did think there was going to be a dangerous situation,

279
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I think you would have brought your own security.

280
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You say you don't like the brand, you I'm sure hadn't tried the product for more than a week,

281
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
because they offered you that deal on the spot at Coachella,

282
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
and nine days later you had the story, so you hadn't even tried it for a full month.

283
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
James always said that he couldn't promote Halo on his channel,

284
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
and really do like you know heavy endorsement, was because he has a teenage audience,

285
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
and it would just be inappropriate.

286
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You sold out me, but you threw away our friendship, but you lied to me,

287
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
made up a story, you knew this would be embarrassing for me.

288
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
No our relationship is not transactional, I have never asked you for anything in return,

289
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
and you kept it up for 24 hours, of course I didn't want to call you back.

290
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
But then you go and post an apology, and you can't even mention my brand name,

291
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
like I'm not an idiot, I know what contracts look like, I know what the exclusivities look like,

292
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
and it just smelled rotten to me.

293
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You don't get to the success that James Charles has without knowing how to work someone,

294
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
and I don't want to be worked, I don't want to be manipulated,

295
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:07,000
and I tried everything that I could, but I don't matter to him right now,

296
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm only a piece in his game, and everything's a game, and I'm tapping out.

297
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
No longer does it look like James Charles impulsively set up a sponsor to sort himself security,

298
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
and then had a case of immediate regret and took it down,

299
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
it seems like a calculated move dressed up as an impulsive one to try and make Tati,

300
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
and other viewers feel sympathy when he apologises,

301
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
it no longer has the same impression on the audience.

302
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Tati's video shut James into a corner into which there was nothing he could say,

303
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
unless any of the claims were false,

304
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
and Tati already made the assertion that she has receipts.

305
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
To Tati and James Westbrook,

306
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:57,000
um, I'm sorry for everything that is going on and everything that I've put you through over the past few weeks.

307
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And well, that's the thing, Tati's video didn't represent a revelation that James Charles messes up or hurts people,

308
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
because a lot of people already knew that,

309
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
it represented the idea that James Charles will continue to mess up

310
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
because the consequences he's received for his previous transgressions

311
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
were not enough to actually make him feel remorseful,

312
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
and the Coachella situation is central to that.

313
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
In fact, Tati is basically implying that he staged a situation,

314
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
thus throwing into contention his previous apologies.

315
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
This is serious stuff, but why is it a problem if everything appears so cut and dry?

316
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Let's discuss that and why it served as foreshadowing for the revelation that not everything was completely true.

317
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:50,000
James Charles' copious amounts of viewer trust was hanging on the thread of a singular concept,

318
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
and Tati cut that, and with that came a tidal wave of people just wanting to destroy him.

319
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
His response video was a mess, he should have never responded in the state that he was in,

320
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
cementing the phrase my truth as my new least favourite combination of words.

321
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I've already told my truth about this twice,

322
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:17,000
and instead of talking about it for a third time and explaining it and going into detail and pulling up receipts...

323
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And as it worsened, more and more people came forward,

324
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
regarding James and his very strange behaviour,

325
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
including setting his gender as female on Tinder to try and get straight guys to get with him.

326
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I think he genuinely does have a problem.

327
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Many people watched Tati's video and many people sided with her,

328
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
because even without receipts at the time, a lot of it felt valid,

329
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
including the notion of mentoring people in that belief that they can grow into mature, important figures in the community,

330
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
because of the talent that they have.

331
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And it made sense, you could understand why she wouldn't speak up at first,

332
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
we want to believe in people's ability to improve,

333
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
but I think the fact that people were so keen to unequivocally destroy James Charles

334
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,000
made people overlook some legitimate criticisms and buy into any single story about him.

335
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
The one that probably received the worst internet treatment were the accusations that he behaves in a predatory fashion.

336
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Now, from what we see about James Charles is that he's a juvenile, entitled child who needs to be pulled down to Earth.

337
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
He has a perpetual victim complex when he doesn't get what he wants,

338
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
and his obsession with chasing straight people is unhealthy.

339
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
But so many people took this narrative without evidence, without substantiation,

340
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
and bought into additional stories that were, and I don't often use this word, slanderous.

341
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
There was this story that painted James as a sexual assailant,

342
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
there was another that basically implied he was a pedo,

343
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
and this person went to lengths of editing and keyframing to falsify the DMs,

344
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,000
and they would have spread further if they hadn't been recognised by my fantastically talented colleague John Swan.

345
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Ok, so these screenshots, these are sketch.

346
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
So, these both are screenshots here from the DMs.

347
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Nothing seems suspect at first, it all seems pretty normal.

348
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
These artefacts just look like Twitter artefacts.

349
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
We can see the resolution here is the same on both the pictures, this is important.

350
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Pop this on top of the other layer.

351
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
We can see, look at this status bar at the top.

352
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Why does that move? That should not move, look.

353
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
That's moving several pixels.

354
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
This is, this shouldn't happen.

355
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Nothing's been cropped off, it's the same resolution.

356
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
This isn't a crop, everything's moved.

357
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
That's not what an iPhone does.

358
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Come over here, look at the pictures.

359
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Why is one picture bigger than the other picture?

360
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
This is photoshopped, this is not real.

361
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Definitely sketch.

362
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Receipts are particularly important in bringing people to justice.

363
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It's hard for main victims to come forward often.

364
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
However, the problem with the internet is that it provides a veil of anonymity,

365
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
which enables more power to people because they can evade the repercussions.

366
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
This person recreated false visual DMs, and after they were called out,

367
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
they simply deleted their account.

368
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
It's not hard in the modern era to completely fake claims, and what has subsequently been shown,

369
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and although James clearly has a problem with the way he carries himself,

370
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
as far as we know, he's not a nunce, and not someone who has done some of these terrible things.

371
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Yet many of those tweets received tens of thousands of likes and retweets,

372
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
and many people who probably saw it don't know the truth.

373
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
When attacked, one person tried to use the invalidation of experiences as a defense,

374
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
which is disgusting given how they're invalidating other experiences,

375
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
and how this person clearly felt comfortable to stoke the narrative that gay men are predators.

376
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I mean, there are more than enough claims that he was behaving in a completely unacceptable fashion

377
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
and misusing his responsibility,

378
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
but there is just nothing some people won't do in the digital age for a drop of clout.

379
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
We should always be critical, even to claims against people we don't like.

380
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
All in all, it was a sad demonstration in mob mentality,

381
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
but ultimately, unless James actively responds to these claims, I can't really comment,

382
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
so I guess we'll just leave it here.

383
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Tati did release an additional video, but it didn't really add much to the discussion,

384
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
other than a suppression of the reaction.

385
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
But that's just how it goes, I guess they don't want the drama anymore.

386
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
We may never know the truth.

387
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Anyhow, I hope you enjoyed that video, I want to give a big shoutout to the ed-

388
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
What?

389
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
He's responded?

390
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Shit.

391
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
OH SHIT!

392
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
In the days following Tati's video, there was eventually a swelling among some commentators

393
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
that she wasn't being honest.

394
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I could completely see where they were coming from,

395
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
and in many ways, the lack of evidence was cause for concern.

396
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
However, a lot of the testimony was allegedly based on private conversation,

397
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
of which I could understand why both parties might be hesitant to release,

398
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
and given James' dumpster fire over an initial response, it did seem hard to deny.

399
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
There was, of course, other testimonies such as the waiters that did appear to somewhat contradict the stories,

400
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
but once again, he could have been leaving out context, honestly, anyone could have.

401
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Either way, something didn't sit right, and the critics were onto something,

402
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
and then James clapped back.

403
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
In James' video titled No More Lies, he reversed the momentum onto Tati,

404
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
and onto Jeffree Star, who had also made some quite inflammatory tweets.

405
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Some suggested that he hadn't slash wouldn't clap back,

406
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
because the momentum was so unequivocally against him, there was no way he could respond

407
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
that would turn the tide if he was genuinely innocent.

408
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,000
However, I didn't believe that was the case, and this is important, but also still kinda surprising, for many people.

409
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
People believed Tati on face value for a multitude of reasons that I discussed in my previous parts,

410
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
but I also described her as a highly credible person within the community.

411
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Many people from the outside, from commentary, were very skeptical, and understandably so,

412
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
but in the beauty community, she's a reputable figure.

413
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
What does that credibility ensue exactly?

414
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Well, when we look at her history, she's a bit more of a senior figure, she's mature, has her own business,

415
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
doesn't really look like she has much to gain on the surface, as mentioned.

416
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
The vitamin situation may have well been a motivation, but she's losing a friendship which she clearly valued, right?

417
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
And Charles allegedly had many connections that she would be ostracised from too.

418
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
The odds were so stacked against her, it almost seemed absurd that she'd be doing this for personal gain from many people's perspectives.

419
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
On top of this, many people in the beauty community were well accustomed to Tati's rather uninvolved stance on much of the drama.

420
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
At that stage, you'd expect people to be above such menial things, surely,

421
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
and so it must have been really bad that she'd have to intervene.

422
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Circumstantially, it made sense, and therefore, people just accepted it, and that effect magnified itself.

423
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
What added credibility was the fact that she said she had receipts. Remember that?

424
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:45,000
If that's the playing field that we're on and I have to go there, just know my receipts are stacked thick.

425
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
People don't always want to release private receipts, they're normally held as more captive until someone challenges them.

426
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Even though we hadn't seen too much, many people saw her as a fairly airtight case.

427
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I mean, if she had receipts, what would James Charles do? Show them?

428
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Before posting my stories, I actually did text Tati first out of respect for her, giving her heads up about the sponsorship, but she was immediately upset.

429
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I tried my best to kind of explain the entire situation and also gave her a direct apology as well,

430
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
but at this point, I had signed the contract and I absolutely had to post it. There was no getting out of it.

431
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,000
For several days, I made countless attempts to contact both Tati and her husband James on all their different phone numbers.

432
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I texted and called Tati's business number, her family number, and also James' personal phone number as well.

433
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:33,000
After a full entire week of trying to reach out and handle things in private with Tati and her husband James and getting no response,

434
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I figured at this time, it'd be best to just respect their space, give them their privacy,

435
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,000
and that whenever Tati was ready, she would reach back out to me to handle things in private and hopefully move on with our friendship.

436
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
We said that he couldn't promote Halo on his channel and really do heavy endorsement.

437
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
It was because he has a teenage audience and it would just be inappropriate.

438
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Now, this thing was just confusing to me mostly because this conversation never actually happened.

439
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Um, if you guys know my channel, you would know that I don't really do dedicated product reviews ever,

440
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:08,000
which is what Tati is known for, but even though that is the case, I've still multiple times talked about her products on all my social media networks.

441
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I have to word the- okay, I forgot to say two. Hello. I'm going to a really important event later on tonight.

442
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
My best friend-

443
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
No, we are going to a reported event.

444
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Yes, this is true.

445
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And this is a very important launch to me because it is my best friend Tati. She is launching something new on Halo Beauty.

446
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Super proud of her. By the time this video is out, it will already be up, so go check it out. Promo for Tati, love you the most.

447
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Who doesn't need a little beauty boost every now and then?

448
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Two of the following statements are real claims made by the original Halo Beauty booster supplement.

449
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Oh!

450
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Which are the real ones?

451
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Can I just say I love you guys for putting a Halo question in there?

452
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I love you for that.

453
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I just received my package from Halo Beauty. This is Tati's brand new brand.

454
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I did not tell Tati that I was buying these, but I did pay for these myself because I just wanted to support her, and I'm so happy.

455
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I know she's getting a lot of backlash on this, which is making me so mad because I know she's worked so hard on these for the past several years now.

456
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Congratulations, Tati. I love you literally so much, and I'm very, very proud of you in all your hard work.

457
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:14,000
The I'm a celebrity thing is really incredibly frustrating to me because this is an inside joke between my friends and I that Tati has also participated in,

458
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
and she twisted this to be something far worse than what it is.

459
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I'm going to try my best to make a long story very short.

460
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
The next day, Sam slid into my DMs first, and I happened to see him.

461
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
We started talking back and forth, and he mentioned that he was flattered by me flirting with him the night beforehand.

462
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Sorry about last night. You were very attractive.

463
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And then I responded, but it's all getting very flattering, actually.

464
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
A few minutes into the conversation, I asked him about his sexuality, and he told me straight up that he was bisexual.

465
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Oh my god, you tried to trick a straight man into thinking he's gay.

466
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
There was no straight men being manipulated anywhere in the story like Tati mentioned.

467
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Sam texted me saying he was fully gay, but it was a trap to get me on FaceTime so he could illegally record the conversation to include in the video that he was planning later on.

468
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Like I said, at the end of the conversation, I asked Sam how he came to this conclusion, and then he told me he was not fully gay, to which I hung up out of frustration.

469
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Later on, he texted me saying he was confirmed bi.

470
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,000
This is why, in Sam's video, he included a screenshot of me telling him I did not think he was fully straight.

471
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:22,000
This comment had a lot of people really upset and confused as to why I was telling somebody their sexuality, but there's a very simple explanation.

472
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Sam and I talked for a very, very long time, and his sexuality, like I said, wavered a lot.

473
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Every time that he was a little bit confused, we had open and honest conversations about it, and he always asked me my input, and I gave it to him.

474
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I would never out somebody, and I have never, ever tried to manipulate somebody's sexuality, including his point blank period.

475
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Yeah, I guess he could. There aren't as many layers to this video as Tati's, because there doesn't need to be.

476
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:53,000
What you need to do is refute the evidence, primarily, and go at Tati's credibility, and he did, with nuclear effect.

477
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
He pretty much mirrored Tati's very calm, composed tone, and had evidence to back it up.

478
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:03,000
He went for the core, underlying sentiments in the video. He managed to debunk the idea that he wasn't reaching out to her.

479
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:10,000
He didn't waste time on her comments about how much she had helped him. He dealt with the boy in Seattle, and showed that boy's perspective as rather false.

480
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,000
He also went for the false allegations, and showed how mob mentality ran through even the most celebrated popular figures, such as Zara Larsson.

481
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
He pretty much went for every single system that drove the initial reaction, and that was important.

482
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It wasn't just isolated situations, he went at the individual constructs. Why Tati's video existed in the first place?

483
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Dispatched. Why people have a problem with his behaviour? Dispatched. Why are people reacting in the way that they did?

484
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Dispatched. There were always going to be people who were reluctant to hear him out, but that did not matter.

485
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
At the core of it was an irrefutable statement of defiance to people who had called him out.

486
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:51,000
They had basically nothing other than a few sporadic statements, and as he showed that they had either fabricated or overblown those ones,

487
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
it allowed him to apologise in places and for people to be okay with it.

488
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Because after all, if his accusers are that bad, then surely James deserves another chance, right?

489
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
However, it was not over, and someone who immediately became the centre of attention was Jeffree Star.

490
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
A few hours later, while I was getting ready for the Met Gala, I got this text from Jeffree.

491
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Concerned but mostly really, really confused, I reached out to him about meeting together in private in hopes to speak together and figure out the misunderstanding,

492
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
but he didn't reply, and by the time I was about to hit publish, I received yet another text from Jeffree Star.

493
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I've already cleared up Sam, and our nights together are being 100% consensual.

494
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
He was absolutely not trapped in a hotel room, but Jeffree also brings up Zach.

495
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Zach is his boyfriend Nate's brother, and not only did I not pursue Zach, who identifies as mainly straight,

496
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
but it was actually Jeffree who suggested that I talk to him in the first place.

497
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Hey Nate, this brother is single, and mainly straight, right up your alley.

498
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Sounds good.

499
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Sounds great for me.

500
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And he just moved here, work!

501
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,000
A few days later, on Monday, I woke up again in the middle of the night from a phone call from my little brother Ian, who was very, very upset.

502
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:05,000
He told me he had tweeted, saying why do people act so tough online about somebody from his hometown who was bullying him,

503
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
and Jeffree Star, of all people, had quote-tweeted Ian's tweet, saying,

504
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Many people were quick to call out Jeffree for bullying a kid who had nothing to do with the situation literally at all, and he deleted the tweet.

505
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
After this, I went to check my phone and noticed that Jeffree had texted me a few minutes prior, and I opened my phone to this.

506
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I really want to read this text out loud, just so you all get to hear exactly what I had to read, but also so I don't miss anything.

507
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Grayson is going on camera shortly, to finally tell the world how you tried to molest him and touch him in his sleep,

508
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
and made him uncomfortable for months, you sick motherfucker.

509
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Next, Zach will be going on camera to tell how twisted and sick you were,

510
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
trying to get him to like you and then make him feel bad when he didn't want to send you photos back.

511
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Then, Sam from Seattle will be joining me and Cameron to talk about you trapping him in his hotel room.

512
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
You need to be locked in prison for a very long time.

513
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
You need the internet taken away from you. You are a danger to society.

514
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
This was something else. Jeffree Star did this.

515
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
This is disgusting. It is defamatory.

516
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:28,000
It is actually shocking that someone with Jeffree's stars, clout, and power would ever send something like that without the actual evidence to back it up.

517
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
He just accused someone of attempting to molest Grayson Dolan. What?

518
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
This is where I really started to feel for James' case, because this is just too far.

519
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Jeffree also sent a message to James' friend too, which is just insane.

520
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And on top of this, he seems so nice to his accusers who've peddled this narrative.

521
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:55,000
First and foremost, I do want to issue a thank you to both Jeffree and Tati for taking some of the responsibility, for blowing this whole thing up, and for starting everything.

522
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I really respect that a lot, and I also appreciate the fact that they are trying to redirect the hate away, because I think we're all aware at this point that it has gotten way too far.

523
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
If I've known anything about Tati over the past three years, it's that she has a huge, huge heart.

524
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,000
There's no denying that, and I think that, or I do believe her when she says that she did not want this to get so vile.

525
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I don't really think any of us thought it was going to be as big as it really was.

526
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Why would he do this? Well, maybe one more twist was around the corner.

527
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:31,000
As in response to the video, Jeffree put out multiple tweets stating that he had evidence, he had receipts, and Tati implied that James was thoroughly dishonest.

528
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I mean, there have been so many twists and turns in this saga, we were ready for more, right? What did we get?

529
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:47,000
There was a lot happening behind the scenes, and I think today I would like to shed some light on the entire experience,

530
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:54,000
because I think that things are getting crazy, dangerous, and we need to have a conversation.

531
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Hmm...

532
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Emerging subscribers, and with the anticipation on him to expose James Charles' lies, Jeffree Star released his video,

533
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Never Doing This Again. It revealed absolutely nothing, and left me feeling rather irritated.

534
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Likewise, it left some people in the community rather satisfied, because as soon as he released it, he began gaining back the respect and subscribers that he had lost.

535
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Now, most of you have seen some brutal tweets that I sent out last week, a lot of you have seen the vicious text messages that I sent,

536
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:41,000
and I want to let you understand something. Because I said those things, that does not equal me hating James Charles.

537
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I sat there yesterday, and I started to get really angry, I was going to pull voice memos, I was going to pull old text messages from other people that don't want to be involved,

538
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,000
and I was just getting into a place where it wasn't healthy, okay?

539
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Today, I know what people want. They want me to sit here and degrade James, they want me to open up my phone and expose it all.

540
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I'm done doing that, and it may be shocking, some of you may be like, oh you're just trying to save your own ass, are you a liar, are you this?

541
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I'm willing to bite the bullet and let anyone think what they want, but today I will not be posting voice memos, I will not be posting text messages,

542
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I will not be exposing anything more, this has to stop.

543
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Did I jump the gun on a situation that I didn't fully understand and chime in? Absolutely, and I am living with that every day.

544
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
There's a lot of questions about my tweets, and I want to say that I regret them.

545
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I don't regret much in my life, but I regret hitting the send button because they were bigger and louder than I ever imagined,

546
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:57,000
and it made things worse when I could have handled things privately, and that is something that I'm working on.

547
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I'm embarrassed of myself, I'm embarrassed for my family that they have to see things online,

548
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:11,000
and I'm sad that Nathan and my friends have to go online and deal with this as well because of my actions.

549
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I know who I am, and this beauty community right now is suffering, and I'm really sad that everything is going on,

550
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:26,000
and I know that may be hard to believe because there are so many people that have opinions, they think that I get off on drama,

551
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:35,000
and anytime there's a situation, I insert myself, it's been a really quiet year for me, and I didn't want this to happen,

552
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
and I should have known better.

553
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,000
In the video, he basically stated that although he could release evidence, he won't, because he's so virtuous

554
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,000
and doesn't want to stoke the bitter fire of drama that is currently burning, because it could cause so much pain.

555
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I mean, he has voice members that could destroy James Charles and all the disgusting things he's done,

556
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:59,000
but he's not gonna release them because we all need time to heal, in spite of the fact that he's an alleged danger to society.

557
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I hate to get all overly moral about this, but I believed in better from these people, my mistake.

558
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Such a huge proportion of the LGBT community have to suffer through sexual assault, and given how prominent the LGBT community is in the beauty community,

559
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
you'd think they'd be a bit more sensitive to throwing around allegations like they're paper planes.

560
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I'm not in the beauty community, so this video will have very little impact.

561
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It's a takeaway for all my viewers who choose to watch it, but I really feel that Jeffree Star overstepped a line here.

562
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:34,000
He not only threatened James Charles with evidence that he refuses to release, the allegations themselves related to sexual assault,

563
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
personal to me, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.

564
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
When Tati's video came out, I was open to some of the claims, and until James' response, I defended the possibility of them,

565
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
because such behaviour is a serious matter.

566
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
James was fairly quiet for a few days, and I believed in better from a community that seeks to empower people.

567
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,000
After Jeffree's video, I was annoyed, and expected a more volatile reaction for such a transparent act of manipulation,

568
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
and instead, James accepted them back with open arms. It is unsettling.

569
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
And let's get this clear, the reason that this was patched up so quickly was because of business.

570
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
It was more beneficial for them that they resolve their differences right now, and I understand that,

571
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
but ultimately, that's what confused me about this situation.

572
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Tati has been a person with a level of credibility. She's done so well for herself.

573
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I gave her the benefit of the doubt for a long time because I could not imagine her lying.

574
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I also gave her the benefit of the doubt because James Charles is an icon, with a ton of people backing him,

575
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
and therefore every single claim she'd make would have to be true.

576
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
It didn't make sense to me that she'd lie because even if James Charles was an unstable mess,

577
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,000
there was no way that the numerous people behind him wouldn't help him form some sort of coherent response,

578
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
and he did, but it still bemuses me why they released that video in the first place.

579
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I guess I was wrong, but it still doesn't add up every now and then.

580
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I just think it's a ruse for Shane Dawson's documentary or some social experiment or mob mentality,

581
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
because honestly, that would make more sense.

582
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
But then I realised that you were dealing with scenarios that heaped huge subscriber damage,

583
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,000
and I think it has to be legit right. No one would conspire to carry such a forced thing out.

584
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
In one of his texts, Jeffery compares James to Manny.

585
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
You can't discard James Charles like you would Manny or Laura Lee,

586
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,000
because James Charles has an undeniable appeal that transcends scandal, as seen again and again,

587
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
which is why he was growing at an unassailable rate.

588
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Either this is a ruse, or Tati and Jeffery really aren't as smart,

589
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
or they knew the audience would come back, which it appears they might be,

590
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
but it's still a bit up in the air,

591
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
and it also annoys me that they would begin to throw around such allegations as ammunition for petty drama.

592
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
As mentioned, there are a lot of victims in the community.

593
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
It seems so insensitive that Jeffery would even consider sending such a threat,

594
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
but maybe because the community is so inherently dramatic, these things carry less gravity.

595
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
It's disappointing that such vindictive behaviour is validated,

596
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
because the community is already vindictive enough,

597
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
and even though James Charles may emerge with a few scratches and bruises,

598
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
whoever is subjected next to the drama may not have the same courtesies,

599
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
because by then, it'll all be boring to the outside world.

600
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
The beauty community is a community like no other.

601
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Creators have gone out to destroy each other's careers,

602
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
and yet have had them emboldened.

603
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
The one really interesting take that I'd like to finish on

604
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
is that you can have all the circumstantial evidence to corroborate a story,

605
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
and that was the case for Tati.

606
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
She had so many boxes ticked,

607
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
but going to the store isn't the same as getting the receipt,

608
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
and when it came to the cold, hard evidence,

609
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
James had it, and yet we were all led on,

610
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
because the explanation appealed to our biases and made sense.

611
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
But when it came down to the line, we were misled,

612
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
and although they may have patched it up, a sour taste may linger.

613
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
For me it does, at least.

614
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
So yes, that's the video.

615
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Worked hard on this one, been on the grind.

616
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Of course, if there are new developments, I might have to make another one,

617
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,000
but obviously, it's only gonna be if it's significant enough to necessarily turn the tide,

618
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
and I don't really like making multiple videos on one situation,

619
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
but I guess that does come across in my content a little.

620
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I would love to hear your thoughts nonetheless,

621
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I would love to give a big shout out to the editors who have once again done a fantastic job.

622
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I also need to give a big thanks to my Patreons on screen right now,

623
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
thank you for your generosity,

624
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
and also my $50 Patreon, Sumhala Baloo, thank you again,

625
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,000
and my $100 Patreons, Brandon and Evening Steel, thank you very much.

626
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
The generosity is really appreciated, especially when times get tricky with YouTube,

627
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
they're being a bit dickie recently, I don't like them again.

628
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I don't really have too much else to say, if you need to, hit me up,

629
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Twitter, at The Right Opinion, Facebook, Discord, I'm in those too,

630
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
you can get me wherever, that sounded a bit weird, but who cares.

631
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
But until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you in the next one.

632
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Thanks for watching!
