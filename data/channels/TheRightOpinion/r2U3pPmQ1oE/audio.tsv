0	5440	Hey you guys, welcome to today's video. Obviously from the title you know that this is going to be
6000	8000	intense,
8000	10000	different,
10000	15540	and this is absolutely not a video I ever thought in a million years that I would be making.
30000	40000	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
40000	42000	And who said internet drama was boring?
42000	44000	Well, many people.
44000	46000	But let's face it, not too much has happened this year.
46000	51000	And the usual suspects such as Jake Paul have just appeared to fade into the background.
51000	56000	As people finally tire from having to expose them for whatever stupid thing they've done this month.
56000	59000	And it's not like they've stopped doing stupid stuff, it's Jake Paul.
59000	62000	But we want new drama, some new people to ruin.
62000	64000	Hooray! We love that, that's the spirit.
64000	66000	So let's talk about the beauty community.
66000	69000	In 2018 I made a video on the beauty community.
69000	72000	It wasn't perfect, I mean no video truly is.
72000	78000	But one of the greatest points that I raised was that they were kind of taking over a significant proportion of drama from previous communities.
78000	82000	And with the rise of the beauty oriented drama channels to really embellish on that niche,
82000	85000	it only meant that subsequent dramas were going to gain more traction.
86000	91000	But why do so many people seem to care about the drama in this specific community on principle?
91000	96000	Is it because it's a lot equivalent to the sort of drama you get in a cliche TV show based on high school experience?
96000	102000	Yeah, in fact everyone's always throwing shade at each other and that makes it a bit entertaining.
102000	107000	Equally they all purport to have this goody two shoes persona, it's always like some moral battle.
107000	112000	So when someone does do something that we perceive as shitty, we're ready to drag them out onto the dance floor.
112000	115000	Now what makes a drama somewhat seismic in its impact?
115000	119000	Many people would say to the point that it invokes a loss of subscribers onto a channel,
119000	122000	and to be honest we haven't really seen that much this year.
122000	127000	But like Waiting For Buses, two came along at once, Pro Jared and James Charles.
127000	131000	Now as I declared in my tweet, I'm still very interested in the Pro Jared situation,
131000	136000	but it seems that at the time, he hid behind the wave of outrage against James Charles.
136000	138000	Let's make it so the tide doesn't leave him at the shore.
138000	144000	Either way, I'm hoping that there's still more to come on this situation, so I decided to focus on today's.
144000	149000	The beauty community, for all its makeup, has some real savagery lying underneath,
149000	153000	and we witnessed that last year when Jeffree Star got into drama with a few people,
153000	156000	and most notoriously Manny Mue and Laura Lee,
156000	159000	and when the court of public opinion came out in favour of Star,
159000	162000	damage was dealt that can still be witnessed to this day.
162000	168000	The beauty community is truly brutal, a cheeky expose or well placed drama can destroy anyone,
168000	172000	and the effects are long term, you don't see that in many other places.
172000	179000	So I saw that today's subject, James Charles, was experiencing a decrease in subscribers of unprecedented amounts.
179000	184000	Well it didn't surprise me looking at how cutthroat the beauty community has the capability to be,
184000	187000	but even with that said, it's more than that.
187000	190000	James Charles is not just any ordinary beauty creator.
190000	200000	In fact it was so fun and so fresh, drum roll please, that we decided to do it all summer long.
200000	207000	James Charles is the 19 year old lad on whatever number of subscribers he's on at the time of this video's release,
207000	212000	but for the last few months he's been a huge name in the beauty community, for better and for worse.
212000	218000	On one hand, his personality, although not my cup of tea, no pun intended, is pretty memorable.
218000	221000	He has a great way of establishing hooks, especially with the phrase Sister,
221000	225000	which at this point I'm surprised his management haven't Sister trademarked it.
225000	228000	He's a creative, flamboyant guy with a lot of going for him.
228000	231000	Like every channel, he's got into a bit of drama here and there,
231000	237000	but nothing prominent enough to really gain attention outside the people who were already seeking drama.
237000	241000	And as mentioned, drama for beauty channels is pretty much a daily event,
241000	246000	that's the problem with drama sometimes, it becomes so common that no one is honestly surprised by it
246000	248000	and therefore it lacks any greater effect.
248000	253000	This changed however, on the 10th of May, when Tati Westbrook, another beauty creator,
253000	258000	dropped a video by the name of By Sister, a play on James' iconic phrase,
258000	263000	in which she documents why, in spite of her extensive history supporting and working with him,
263000	265000	she no longer wants to associate with him.
265000	270000	These entail a series of criticisms that relate back to the way he has treated his friends,
270000	272000	his inappropriate behaviour at certain events,
272000	275000	the fact that he promoted a brand that would be sensitive to younger children,
275000	280000	in spite of the fact that he has said to Tati that he wouldn't promote hers due to the age of his demographic,
280000	285000	and the real kicker that everyone has honed in on, his predatory behaviour,
285000	291000	for which he has a strange obsession with chasing and supposedly trying to persuade straight men to sleep with him.
291000	296000	All this, when presented in a very classy, mature tone that Tati seems to emanate all over her work,
296000	300000	was enough not just to completely halt all of James Charles' momentum,
300000	304000	but to cause the greatest sub-loss in YouTube's history.
304000	309000	In fact, in one day he lost over a million subscribers, which is astonishing.
309000	314000	Following this, it was like the dam had broken, and a flurry of allegations came crashing down on him,
314000	319000	many alleging that he had a habit of catfishing and manipulating straight guys into various positions,
319000	321000	metaphorical positions that is.
321000	326000	On top of this, a load of further accusations from a various range of sources came forward,
326000	330000	some more true than others, but they all received incredible levels of attention.
330000	334000	However, like anything, there will always follow backlash, and like this again,
334000	338000	many people came forward to dispute many things, some the verifiability of the claims,
338000	342000	some Tati's own motivations, and refrain from speaking out sooner,
342000	345000	I mean, PewDiePie made a video covering all of this.
345000	349000	On top of this, it was revealed that some additional claims have been completely falsified,
349000	352000	thus leading to more collateral drama relating back to James' career.
352000	358000	Now on one hand, I was pleased, I was one step closer to becoming the most subscribed gay James on the platform,
358000	361000	on the other, I felt there was a bit more to the story,
361000	365000	so I put out a tweet asking people if they had any opinions themselves,
365000	367000	and what they wanted me to look into and discuss,
367000	371000	because although I had my own line, there is still a lot to clear up,
371000	373000	and although I do have one clear statement in mind,
373000	375000	today I will be covering all of these topics,
375000	379000	and explaining why I personally believe this situation was inevitable,
379000	381000	exactly why this detail is very important,
381000	385000	and why it has created many more problems in regards to our own judgement of the situation,
385000	389000	and how this was exposed when James finally did come forward.
389000	391000	I don't think I really have too much else to add,
391000	394000	so I suggest we move in and see exactly what I mean.
404000	410000	One of the hot takes circulating around Twitter currently,
410000	413000	is with all the drama that James Charles has been involved in,
413000	416000	why was it this one that should have taken him down?
416000	421000	Is it just because straight people are looking to reinforce their fears against the scary gays?
421000	423000	Especially when throughout the last few years,
423000	429000	James Charles has supposedly been involved in multiple scandals with various people and various allegations,
429000	431000	I mean he really did have to catch them all,
431000	437000	racism, transphobia, inappropriate comments towards others, and alleged exploitation of fans.
437000	440000	With this all in mind, guys, why wasn't he cancelled immediately?
440000	445000	Was it because if James Charles came to a house with Ben Shapiro in blackface,
445000	448000	the Heteros would be more concerned about Ben Shapiro's safety?
448000	450000	As hilarious as that thought would be,
450000	453000	and I'm not suggesting it's completely after the question,
453000	455000	it's not exactly the case.
455000	457000	You see, the devil's in the details.
457000	459000	The way we can understand these previous dramas
459000	465000	is actually as strong foundations for why people were so ready to turn on James Charles when the time came.
465000	468000	So let's look at them, explain why they contributed to the scenario,
468000	470000	but why he ultimately got away from them.
470000	473000	James Charles is an impulsive person.
473000	476000	I don't think that statement is remotely controversial.
476000	480000	In many ways, that is what made him so monumentally popular.
480000	485000	His speed of conversation and energy during videos really enhances his charisma in many ways.
485000	488000	However, equally it means that he does not have a filter.
488000	494000	Many like to envision their favourite creators as just only thinking lovely, wholesome thoughts throughout their career,
494000	496000	but that's a load of bullshit.
496000	499000	The truth is, you can think of anything at any time.
499000	504000	The most twisted, broken, and often offensive thoughts that you keep inside your twisted mind
504000	506000	to satisfy that craving of darkness that many have.
506000	513000	The problem is, most public figures know exactly how many of those thoughts would be received if they decide to say it out loud.
513000	515000	James Charles probably has some level of that,
515000	519000	but clearly lacks the judgement that other figures in the beauty community have,
519000	522000	and that can be found in many tweets and even videos,
522000	525000	even ones that aren't inherently offensive,
525000	528000	which is why he often says stuff and then deletes it 10 minutes later,
528000	535000	because the emotional flashbang that went off in his head telling him publicly airing his dirty laundry was a great idea,
535000	537000	suddenly didn't seem such a fantastic initiative.
537000	541000	However, his greatest weakness is also his greatest defence,
541000	546000	because a lot of times it'll retract a comment very quickly and apologise from the bottom of his heart.
546000	551000	And a lot of people don't like to go after people who've apologised and pledged to do better,
551000	554000	because an apology is meant to be a resolution.
554000	558000	The only time we might pursue it further is if we feel the apology isn't genuine,
558000	561000	and therefore we think they'll keep up these habits.
561000	569000	A lot of people didn't want to be seen as just continuously dragging someone out over stuff that they'd already apologised for.
569000	575000	However, it did build a lot of resentment in people who have their suspicions about his intentions,
575000	580000	and probably gave people an impetus to really come down on him when these videos inevitably came.
580000	584000	So what needed to change about these scandals that would suddenly bring him down?
584000	588000	I mean all the stuff that had happened hadn't slowed his momentum.
588000	591000	Another thing was because the main scandals weren't too frequent,
591000	594000	they'd often happen with some time between them,
594000	599000	it never really had the capacity to snowball because it kinda happened in brief spurts of interest,
599000	602000	rather than one continuous ongoing scenario,
602000	605000	and although there were people with clear vendettas against him,
605000	608000	they're not going to be the ones subscribed to him.
608000	614000	Now, when various scandals arise, the biggest problem with public response is that it often takes the form of many different narratives,
614000	618000	so if we take James Charles' tweets, for example the one about Ebola,
618000	623000	some may say, this proves James Charles is a racist and should be cancelled,
623000	628000	others might say, well I don't think he's a racist and shouldn't be cancelled, but he should apologise.
628000	633000	And because of this dissent within the group of critics, you're going to have trouble outshining James Charles' response,
633000	637000	because he'll present one narrative that represents his mindset.
637000	642000	It's like party politics, and in a way it's not an inherently unhealthy thing,
642000	646000	but James Charles will present his perspective, and with all that momentum behind him,
646000	651000	he's going to get the backing of people who want to believe he's an impulsive lad who just can't think straight sometimes.
651000	658000	Essentially, if James Charles was going to actually have a wake up call, you'd need one person to bring a singular narrative forward.
658000	664000	Infiltration had to come from the inside, and that could only come from a creator not just in the beauty community,
664000	670000	but one with experience, and one with respect, the sort of figure who has the power to giveth and taketh away.
670000	677000	Also, given the closure on a lot of these previous incidents, a person who calls them out would also have to be typically calling them out for new drama,
677000	683000	or drama that at least James Charles hadn't personally addressed or faced down any consequences for.
683000	685000	This is where we introduce Tati Westbrook.
685000	688000	Tati Westbrook is one of the most senior creators in the beauty community.
688000	695000	She's 37 years of age, and owner of the company Halo Beauty, which sells products related to skin, hair and nail treatment primarily.
695000	700000	As someone with a few more years on her, she definitely comes across with a bit more dignity than most.
700000	706000	She also has an extensive history of working with James Charles, and a constant run of promoting his products and supporting him,
706000	711000	so it's very likely there is a significant overlap in audiences between the two creators.
711000	713000	This is an important point to note.
713000	717000	People like ImAlexx and so on can call out James Charles any day of the week.
717000	724000	It won't have a huge effect, because firstly as a perceived outsider, these creators carry less credibility in their experience,
724000	730000	and secondly, there's just not the same overlap in audience that can cause an exodus from James' channel.
730000	733000	All of these factors make Tati an important puzzle piece.
733000	735000	But what was the fresh drama?
735000	737000	Well, there's this event called Coachella.
737000	744000	This is a pretty popular music festival that is attended by many icons, and when James got there, shock horror, he needed security.
744000	750000	Who would have thought, but do not fear, a company by the name of Sugar Bear Hair had a contract,
750000	754000	and would help them out, if he could promote their fantastic product.
754000	759000	So he did, but Sugar Bear Hair is a primary competitor of Halo Beauty,
759000	764000	and Tati felt upset by this, so she posted a story to her Instagram explaining her upset,
764000	768000	and although not calling him out, pretty much implying that she was talking about James.
768000	774000	James seeing this after the expiration of his promotion posted a public response stating that he was sorry to Tati,
774000	778000	and wasn't thinking about it at the time, very typical James Charles.
778000	783000	So the drama's over, right? Right? Wrong.
794000	801000	Intense, different, and this is absolutely not a video I ever thought in a million years that I would be making.
801000	807000	You see, in many ways, there were many people ready to pounce on a significant anti-James Charles story,
807000	813000	there have been people discussing it for ages, but only Tati Westbrook could make it the perfect storm of destruction.
813000	819000	Whether that was her intention, I cannot say, I think it would have been hard to foresee such an outcome,
819000	824000	but it's what happened, and it was enabled by all the previous factors considered.
824000	830000	However, with that said, a good exposed video would still require a careful sensitivity about it.
830000	837000	However, using the templates of last year's drama, you could identify what works, not being over-emotional.
837000	854000	I'm so sorry, Yuka. I'm so sorry for disappointing you. It hurts me so bad.
854000	860000	Establishing credibility not just as a person with experience, but also a person with positive intent.
860000	865000	There's something about him that I just adore and love, and he'll grow out of this, and he'll mature,
865000	870000	and I want to be someone that can give him solid advice, and there's something in my heart that is pulled to him,
870000	877000	and I love him, and I am there for this kid through and through, and I really have been,
877000	879000	and there's so much that you guys don't know.
879000	883000	I'm providing a valid set of reasons for why you're doing what you're doing.
883000	888000	And I'm going to share a lot of it with you, because I feel at this point that I have to,
888000	893000	because Gabriel Zamora decided to drag me out on the dance floor by calling me out by name
893000	895000	in a video that he made about opinions and makeup.
895000	900000	Now as tonal presentation goes, it's really a masterstroke in every area.
900000	902000	Tati seems calm, but not disinterested.
902000	908000	It's a video that carries a lot of dignity, and exactly what Charles' critics would have wanted in harming his reputation.
908000	914000	Of course, there was very little actual evidence, but circumstantially, to a community, everything added up.
914000	918000	When taking someone down, the key is to undermine their redeemability.
918000	923000	This is dispatched very early on in the first few minutes by Tati, who presents herself as one of the people
923000	928000	who has openly defended James Charles, and given him multiple opportunities to redeem himself.
928000	935000	And for someone that I helped when no one would, asking for absolutely nothing in return,
935000	941000	never asking for a payback, never asking for a dime, any of the deals that were structured,
941000	946000	if anyone ever offered a kickback, we'd say no, put it in James' pocket, help James, help him.
946000	950000	You know, any time I had an opportunity to help him make money, I would.
950000	954000	If I could give him advice, I did. If he needed a safe landing, I was here.
954000	959000	I have so much empathy for people, and I really want to see people grow and step into themselves,
959000	965000	and I'm more the person to ask, like, well, what made you feel that you needed to do XYZ?
965000	969000	Like, what happened to you, or like, why do you feel like you need to do that?
969000	976000	I can't be the person to point and write people off very quickly.
976000	981000	Like, it takes a lot for me to really want to not be associated with someone,
981000	990000	and so I've always had a really forgiving heart, because I know to get here, I've required a lot of forgiveness myself.
990000	993000	If we believe someone can get better, then we're more likely to forgive them.
993000	997000	However, there's a point of no return where that tolerance is broken.
997000	1003000	By presenting herself as one of Charles' biggest defenders, she also made her attack all the more damaging,
1003000	1006000	and the way she expresses herself is extremely relatable.
1006000	1011000	I have many people who I know I've taken the sort of wise man figure in,
1011000	1015000	even though I think they've probably done some really stupid shit.
1015000	1019000	Many of us believe in people's capability to get better, especially when it's our friends,
1019000	1023000	and Tati clearly shows herself as a friend who has just lost that tolerance.
1024000	1030000	With the new drama, she had fresh allegations to show that he's been behaving in the same way that he has been,
1030000	1035000	and importantly, she focuses on the responses, and therefore underlines the redundancy of them.
1035000	1042000	Things were said that I cannot unhear at my dining room table. I cannot unhear it.
1042000	1049000	When I confronted him on it, he cried, he apologised, and you need someone to tell you to stop it.
1049000	1054000	And that's exactly what I did in your kitchen in front of Gabriel Zamora.
1054000	1059000	I had to call every one of them up the next morning and apologise on your behalf because it was so uncomfortable.
1059000	1065000	And I've continued to do that, but it's just all kind of stacking up right now like this.
1065000	1071000	She essentially makes it so if he apologises, it no longer carries the effect that previous apologies had
1071000	1075000	because people are sceptical of the genuine sentiments behind it,
1075000	1079000	because Tati is testifying that he did the same thing to her.
1079000	1082000	It was about image protection rather than actually feeling bad.
1082000	1086000	So with that line of defence, Tati went in with serious allegations.
1086000	1091000	Oh my god, you tried to trick a straight man into thinking he's gay yet again,
1091000	1094000	and somehow you're the victim.
1094000	1100000	You know, it's really disgusting to manipulate someone's sexuality,
1100000	1106000	especially when they are still emerging into adulthood and don't quite have everything figured out.
1106000	1111000	You are using your fame, your power, your money to play with people's emotions,
1111000	1115000	you're threatening to ruin them, you're threatening to embarrass them,
1115000	1121000	and you're doing that to have them behave sexually in your favour, even if they're straight,
1121000	1122000	and you know what, that's not okay.
1122000	1126000	Now there were a fair few claims, but I thought we'd focus in on one primarily,
1126000	1129000	because this has been the source of the most controversy.
1129000	1135000	In a video that was later posted by the waiter in question, he states that he was quote bi-curious,
1135000	1138000	but after the engagement felt like he was straight.
1138000	1142000	On one hand, this doesn't completely reflect Westbrook's retelling of the story,
1142000	1147000	but on the other hand, the DMs the waiter showed clearly demonstrated a coercive side of Charles,
1147000	1153000	telling this person he wasn't actually straight, even if it does come across as more desperate than anything.
1153000	1158000	Charles was definitely the assertive one in this scenario, and also the one with significant amount of power,
1158000	1162000	and James' retelling of the event doesn't quite reflect the DMs either.
1162000	1166000	I was travelling, and I met a really, really beautiful boy at a restaurant,
1166000	1169000	and we caught each other's eye, and I didn't think anything of it,
1169000	1172000	the wait staff was like harassing him because they saw that I kept looking at him and stuff,
1172000	1176000	and the next day, he had DMed me on Instagram, and he was like,
1176000	1178000	oh my god I noticed you last night, I thought you were really beautiful,
1178000	1181000	and I was like, oh my god can I ask, are you straight?
1181000	1182000	And he was like, no I'm bi.
1182000	1184000	So he, right away, told me he was bi.
1184000	1187000	And I did, we can throw the screen shot up here somewhere.
1187000	1189000	At that time, I was bi-curious.
1189000	1194000	He's literally like, hey I just want to let you know I'm really grateful for everything you helped me with,
1194000	1197000	I actually just came out to my mom last night and told her that I was bi, so thank you so much.
1197000	1201000	And so she was super, super supportive, and I told her that I wanted to come visit you,
1201000	1206000	and I've thought about it a lot, and I have talked to her, and I actually think that I am straight, so I'm not gonna come.
1206000	1208000	I was pretty sure I was straight.
1209000	1216000	So I told him in a long text message that I am straight.
1216000	1221000	With all this in mind, Tati continues to recall situations in which James behaved improperly,
1221000	1224000	and then recalls the most recent situation over Sugar Bear.
1224000	1229000	Are you kidding me? A, you say you don't like this brand at all, and that it would be embarrassing.
1229000	1234000	So like stick with that, like stick to what you speak, practice what you preach.
1234000	1237000	You say that you're the realist, you can't be bought, well you just were.
1237000	1241000	I don't think you were in a dangerous situation, I really, really don't.
1241000	1247000	You know fair well how crowds are, so if you did think there was going to be a dangerous situation,
1247000	1249000	I think you would have brought your own security.
1249000	1255000	You say you don't like the brand, you I'm sure hadn't tried the product for more than a week,
1255000	1258000	because they offered you that deal on the spot at Coachella,
1258000	1262000	and nine days later you had the story, so you hadn't even tried it for a full month.
1262000	1265000	James always said that he couldn't promote Halo on his channel,
1265000	1269000	and really do like you know heavy endorsement, was because he has a teenage audience,
1269000	1271000	and it would just be inappropriate.
1271000	1277000	You sold out me, but you threw away our friendship, but you lied to me,
1277000	1282000	made up a story, you knew this would be embarrassing for me.
1282000	1287000	No our relationship is not transactional, I have never asked you for anything in return,
1287000	1291000	and you kept it up for 24 hours, of course I didn't want to call you back.
1291000	1297000	But then you go and post an apology, and you can't even mention my brand name,
1297000	1302000	like I'm not an idiot, I know what contracts look like, I know what the exclusivities look like,
1302000	1306000	and it just smelled rotten to me.
1306000	1313000	You don't get to the success that James Charles has without knowing how to work someone,
1313000	1318000	and I don't want to be worked, I don't want to be manipulated,
1319000	1327000	and I tried everything that I could, but I don't matter to him right now,
1327000	1333000	I'm only a piece in his game, and everything's a game, and I'm tapping out.
1333000	1338000	No longer does it look like James Charles impulsively set up a sponsor to sort himself security,
1338000	1341000	and then had a case of immediate regret and took it down,
1341000	1345000	it seems like a calculated move dressed up as an impulsive one to try and make Tati,
1345000	1348000	and other viewers feel sympathy when he apologises,
1348000	1351000	it no longer has the same impression on the audience.
1351000	1355000	Tati's video shut James into a corner into which there was nothing he could say,
1355000	1357000	unless any of the claims were false,
1357000	1361000	and Tati already made the assertion that she has receipts.
1364000	1367000	To Tati and James Westbrook,
1367000	1377000	um, I'm sorry for everything that is going on and everything that I've put you through over the past few weeks.
1377000	1384000	And well, that's the thing, Tati's video didn't represent a revelation that James Charles messes up or hurts people,
1384000	1386000	because a lot of people already knew that,
1386000	1390000	it represented the idea that James Charles will continue to mess up
1390000	1393000	because the consequences he's received for his previous transgressions
1393000	1396000	were not enough to actually make him feel remorseful,
1396000	1399000	and the Coachella situation is central to that.
1399000	1403000	In fact, Tati is basically implying that he staged a situation,
1403000	1406000	thus throwing into contention his previous apologies.
1406000	1411000	This is serious stuff, but why is it a problem if everything appears so cut and dry?
1411000	1417000	Let's discuss that and why it served as foreshadowing for the revelation that not everything was completely true.
1417000	1430000	James Charles' copious amounts of viewer trust was hanging on the thread of a singular concept,
1430000	1435000	and Tati cut that, and with that came a tidal wave of people just wanting to destroy him.
1435000	1439000	His response video was a mess, he should have never responded in the state that he was in,
1439000	1444000	cementing the phrase my truth as my new least favourite combination of words.
1445000	1448000	I've already told my truth about this twice,
1448000	1457000	and instead of talking about it for a third time and explaining it and going into detail and pulling up receipts...
1457000	1460000	And as it worsened, more and more people came forward,
1460000	1462000	regarding James and his very strange behaviour,
1462000	1467000	including setting his gender as female on Tinder to try and get straight guys to get with him.
1467000	1469000	I think he genuinely does have a problem.
1469000	1473000	Many people watched Tati's video and many people sided with her,
1473000	1476000	because even without receipts at the time, a lot of it felt valid,
1476000	1482000	including the notion of mentoring people in that belief that they can grow into mature, important figures in the community,
1482000	1484000	because of the talent that they have.
1484000	1488000	And it made sense, you could understand why she wouldn't speak up at first,
1488000	1490000	we want to believe in people's ability to improve,
1490000	1494000	but I think the fact that people were so keen to unequivocally destroy James Charles
1494000	1500000	made people overlook some legitimate criticisms and buy into any single story about him.
1500000	1506000	The one that probably received the worst internet treatment were the accusations that he behaves in a predatory fashion.
1506000	1512000	Now, from what we see about James Charles is that he's a juvenile, entitled child who needs to be pulled down to Earth.
1512000	1516000	He has a perpetual victim complex when he doesn't get what he wants,
1516000	1519000	and his obsession with chasing straight people is unhealthy.
1519000	1523000	But so many people took this narrative without evidence, without substantiation,
1523000	1528000	and bought into additional stories that were, and I don't often use this word, slanderous.
1528000	1531000	There was this story that painted James as a sexual assailant,
1531000	1534000	there was another that basically implied he was a pedo,
1534000	1538000	and this person went to lengths of editing and keyframing to falsify the DMs,
1538000	1544000	and they would have spread further if they hadn't been recognised by my fantastically talented colleague John Swan.
1544000	1548000	Ok, so these screenshots, these are sketch.
1548000	1551000	So, these both are screenshots here from the DMs.
1551000	1556000	Nothing seems suspect at first, it all seems pretty normal.
1556000	1559000	These artefacts just look like Twitter artefacts.
1559000	1564000	We can see the resolution here is the same on both the pictures, this is important.
1564000	1567000	Pop this on top of the other layer.
1567000	1572000	We can see, look at this status bar at the top.
1572000	1576000	Why does that move? That should not move, look.
1576000	1581000	That's moving several pixels.
1581000	1584000	This is, this shouldn't happen.
1584000	1587000	Nothing's been cropped off, it's the same resolution.
1587000	1590000	This isn't a crop, everything's moved.
1590000	1592000	That's not what an iPhone does.
1592000	1595000	Come over here, look at the pictures.
1595000	1600000	Why is one picture bigger than the other picture?
1600000	1603000	This is photoshopped, this is not real.
1603000	1604000	Definitely sketch.
1604000	1607000	Receipts are particularly important in bringing people to justice.
1607000	1610000	It's hard for main victims to come forward often.
1610000	1614000	However, the problem with the internet is that it provides a veil of anonymity,
1614000	1618000	which enables more power to people because they can evade the repercussions.
1618000	1622000	This person recreated false visual DMs, and after they were called out,
1622000	1624000	they simply deleted their account.
1624000	1629000	It's not hard in the modern era to completely fake claims, and what has subsequently been shown,
1629000	1632000	and although James clearly has a problem with the way he carries himself,
1632000	1637000	as far as we know, he's not a nunce, and not someone who has done some of these terrible things.
1637000	1641000	Yet many of those tweets received tens of thousands of likes and retweets,
1641000	1644000	and many people who probably saw it don't know the truth.
1644000	1650000	When attacked, one person tried to use the invalidation of experiences as a defense,
1650000	1653000	which is disgusting given how they're invalidating other experiences,
1653000	1658000	and how this person clearly felt comfortable to stoke the narrative that gay men are predators.
1658000	1662000	I mean, there are more than enough claims that he was behaving in a completely unacceptable fashion
1662000	1664000	and misusing his responsibility,
1664000	1669000	but there is just nothing some people won't do in the digital age for a drop of clout.
1669000	1673000	We should always be critical, even to claims against people we don't like.
1673000	1676000	All in all, it was a sad demonstration in mob mentality,
1676000	1680000	but ultimately, unless James actively responds to these claims, I can't really comment,
1680000	1682000	so I guess we'll just leave it here.
1682000	1685000	Tati did release an additional video, but it didn't really add much to the discussion,
1685000	1687000	other than a suppression of the reaction.
1687000	1690000	But that's just how it goes, I guess they don't want the drama anymore.
1690000	1692000	We may never know the truth.
1693000	1697000	Anyhow, I hope you enjoyed that video, I want to give a big shoutout to the ed-
1698000	1699000	What?
1700000	1701000	He's responded?
1704000	1705000	Shit.
1707000	1709000	OH SHIT!
1709000	1714000	In the days following Tati's video, there was eventually a swelling among some commentators
1714000	1716000	that she wasn't being honest.
1716000	1718000	I could completely see where they were coming from,
1718000	1721000	and in many ways, the lack of evidence was cause for concern.
1721000	1724000	However, a lot of the testimony was allegedly based on private conversation,
1724000	1728000	of which I could understand why both parties might be hesitant to release,
1728000	1732000	and given James' dumpster fire over an initial response, it did seem hard to deny.
1732000	1737000	There was, of course, other testimonies such as the waiters that did appear to somewhat contradict the stories,
1737000	1741000	but once again, he could have been leaving out context, honestly, anyone could have.
1741000	1745000	Either way, something didn't sit right, and the critics were onto something,
1745000	1747000	and then James clapped back.
1747000	1751000	In James' video titled No More Lies, he reversed the momentum onto Tati,
1751000	1755000	and onto Jeffree Star, who had also made some quite inflammatory tweets.
1755000	1758000	Some suggested that he hadn't slash wouldn't clap back,
1758000	1762000	because the momentum was so unequivocally against him, there was no way he could respond
1762000	1765000	that would turn the tide if he was genuinely innocent.
1765000	1772000	However, I didn't believe that was the case, and this is important, but also still kinda surprising, for many people.
1772000	1777000	People believed Tati on face value for a multitude of reasons that I discussed in my previous parts,
1777000	1781000	but I also described her as a highly credible person within the community.
1781000	1785000	Many people from the outside, from commentary, were very skeptical, and understandably so,
1785000	1787000	but in the beauty community, she's a reputable figure.
1787000	1789000	What does that credibility ensue exactly?
1789000	1794000	Well, when we look at her history, she's a bit more of a senior figure, she's mature, has her own business,
1794000	1798000	doesn't really look like she has much to gain on the surface, as mentioned.
1798000	1804000	The vitamin situation may have well been a motivation, but she's losing a friendship which she clearly valued, right?
1804000	1808000	And Charles allegedly had many connections that she would be ostracised from too.
1808000	1814000	The odds were so stacked against her, it almost seemed absurd that she'd be doing this for personal gain from many people's perspectives.
1814000	1820000	On top of this, many people in the beauty community were well accustomed to Tati's rather uninvolved stance on much of the drama.
1820000	1824000	At that stage, you'd expect people to be above such menial things, surely,
1824000	1827000	and so it must have been really bad that she'd have to intervene.
1827000	1833000	Circumstantially, it made sense, and therefore, people just accepted it, and that effect magnified itself.
1833000	1837000	What added credibility was the fact that she said she had receipts. Remember that?
1837000	1845000	If that's the playing field that we're on and I have to go there, just know my receipts are stacked thick.
1845000	1851000	People don't always want to release private receipts, they're normally held as more captive until someone challenges them.
1851000	1855000	Even though we hadn't seen too much, many people saw her as a fairly airtight case.
1855000	1858000	I mean, if she had receipts, what would James Charles do? Show them?
1858000	1865000	Before posting my stories, I actually did text Tati first out of respect for her, giving her heads up about the sponsorship, but she was immediately upset.
1865000	1870000	I tried my best to kind of explain the entire situation and also gave her a direct apology as well,
1870000	1875000	but at this point, I had signed the contract and I absolutely had to post it. There was no getting out of it.
1875000	1882000	For several days, I made countless attempts to contact both Tati and her husband James on all their different phone numbers.
1882000	1887000	I texted and called Tati's business number, her family number, and also James' personal phone number as well.
1887000	1893000	After a full entire week of trying to reach out and handle things in private with Tati and her husband James and getting no response,
1893000	1897000	I figured at this time, it'd be best to just respect their space, give them their privacy,
1897000	1903000	and that whenever Tati was ready, she would reach back out to me to handle things in private and hopefully move on with our friendship.
1903000	1908000	We said that he couldn't promote Halo on his channel and really do heavy endorsement.
1908000	1911000	It was because he has a teenage audience and it would just be inappropriate.
1911000	1916000	Now, this thing was just confusing to me mostly because this conversation never actually happened.
1916000	1920000	Um, if you guys know my channel, you would know that I don't really do dedicated product reviews ever,
1920000	1928000	which is what Tati is known for, but even though that is the case, I've still multiple times talked about her products on all my social media networks.
1928000	1933000	I have to word the- okay, I forgot to say two. Hello. I'm going to a really important event later on tonight.
1933000	1934000	My best friend-
1934000	1935000	No, we are going to a reported event.
1935000	1936000	Yes, this is true.
1936000	1940000	And this is a very important launch to me because it is my best friend Tati. She is launching something new on Halo Beauty.
1940000	1944000	Super proud of her. By the time this video is out, it will already be up, so go check it out. Promo for Tati, love you the most.
1944000	1947000	Who doesn't need a little beauty boost every now and then?
1947000	1953000	Two of the following statements are real claims made by the original Halo Beauty booster supplement.
1953000	1954000	Oh!
1954000	1955000	Which are the real ones?
1955000	1958000	Can I just say I love you guys for putting a Halo question in there?
1958000	1960000	I love you for that.
1960000	1967000	I just received my package from Halo Beauty. This is Tati's brand new brand.
1968000	1974000	I did not tell Tati that I was buying these, but I did pay for these myself because I just wanted to support her, and I'm so happy.
1974000	1981000	I know she's getting a lot of backlash on this, which is making me so mad because I know she's worked so hard on these for the past several years now.
1981000	1986000	Congratulations, Tati. I love you literally so much, and I'm very, very proud of you in all your hard work.
1986000	1994000	The I'm a celebrity thing is really incredibly frustrating to me because this is an inside joke between my friends and I that Tati has also participated in,
1994000	1997000	and she twisted this to be something far worse than what it is.
1997000	2000000	I'm going to try my best to make a long story very short.
2000000	2004000	The next day, Sam slid into my DMs first, and I happened to see him.
2004000	2009000	We started talking back and forth, and he mentioned that he was flattered by me flirting with him the night beforehand.
2009000	2011000	Sorry about last night. You were very attractive.
2011000	2015000	And then I responded, but it's all getting very flattering, actually.
2015000	2020000	A few minutes into the conversation, I asked him about his sexuality, and he told me straight up that he was bisexual.
2020000	2024000	Oh my god, you tried to trick a straight man into thinking he's gay.
2024000	2029000	There was no straight men being manipulated anywhere in the story like Tati mentioned.
2029000	2038000	Sam texted me saying he was fully gay, but it was a trap to get me on FaceTime so he could illegally record the conversation to include in the video that he was planning later on.
2038000	2046000	Like I said, at the end of the conversation, I asked Sam how he came to this conclusion, and then he told me he was not fully gay, to which I hung up out of frustration.
2046000	2049000	Later on, he texted me saying he was confirmed bi.
2049000	2055000	This is why, in Sam's video, he included a screenshot of me telling him I did not think he was fully straight.
2055000	2062000	This comment had a lot of people really upset and confused as to why I was telling somebody their sexuality, but there's a very simple explanation.
2062000	2066000	Sam and I talked for a very, very long time, and his sexuality, like I said, wavered a lot.
2066000	2073000	Every time that he was a little bit confused, we had open and honest conversations about it, and he always asked me my input, and I gave it to him.
2073000	2080000	I would never out somebody, and I have never, ever tried to manipulate somebody's sexuality, including his point blank period.
2080000	2086000	Yeah, I guess he could. There aren't as many layers to this video as Tati's, because there doesn't need to be.
2086000	2093000	What you need to do is refute the evidence, primarily, and go at Tati's credibility, and he did, with nuclear effect.
2093000	2097000	He pretty much mirrored Tati's very calm, composed tone, and had evidence to back it up.
2097000	2103000	He went for the core, underlying sentiments in the video. He managed to debunk the idea that he wasn't reaching out to her.
2103000	2110000	He didn't waste time on her comments about how much she had helped him. He dealt with the boy in Seattle, and showed that boy's perspective as rather false.
2110000	2117000	He also went for the false allegations, and showed how mob mentality ran through even the most celebrated popular figures, such as Zara Larsson.
2117000	2122000	He pretty much went for every single system that drove the initial reaction, and that was important.
2122000	2128000	It wasn't just isolated situations, he went at the individual constructs. Why Tati's video existed in the first place?
2128000	2135000	Dispatched. Why people have a problem with his behaviour? Dispatched. Why are people reacting in the way that they did?
2135000	2140000	Dispatched. There were always going to be people who were reluctant to hear him out, but that did not matter.
2140000	2144000	At the core of it was an irrefutable statement of defiance to people who had called him out.
2144000	2151000	They had basically nothing other than a few sporadic statements, and as he showed that they had either fabricated or overblown those ones,
2151000	2155000	it allowed him to apologise in places and for people to be okay with it.
2155000	2160000	Because after all, if his accusers are that bad, then surely James deserves another chance, right?
2160000	2165000	However, it was not over, and someone who immediately became the centre of attention was Jeffree Star.
2165000	2170000	A few hours later, while I was getting ready for the Met Gala, I got this text from Jeffree.
2170000	2178000	Concerned but mostly really, really confused, I reached out to him about meeting together in private in hopes to speak together and figure out the misunderstanding,
2178000	2183000	but he didn't reply, and by the time I was about to hit publish, I received yet another text from Jeffree Star.
2183000	2186000	I've already cleared up Sam, and our nights together are being 100% consensual.
2186000	2191000	He was absolutely not trapped in a hotel room, but Jeffree also brings up Zach.
2191000	2198000	Zach is his boyfriend Nate's brother, and not only did I not pursue Zach, who identifies as mainly straight,
2198000	2202000	but it was actually Jeffree who suggested that I talk to him in the first place.
2202000	2206000	Hey Nate, this brother is single, and mainly straight, right up your alley.
2206000	2208000	Sounds good.
2208000	2210000	Sounds great for me.
2210000	2212000	And he just moved here, work!
2212000	2219000	A few days later, on Monday, I woke up again in the middle of the night from a phone call from my little brother Ian, who was very, very upset.
2219000	2225000	He told me he had tweeted, saying why do people act so tough online about somebody from his hometown who was bullying him,
2225000	2230000	and Jeffree Star, of all people, had quote-tweeted Ian's tweet, saying,
2237000	2244000	Many people were quick to call out Jeffree for bullying a kid who had nothing to do with the situation literally at all, and he deleted the tweet.
2244000	2250000	After this, I went to check my phone and noticed that Jeffree had texted me a few minutes prior, and I opened my phone to this.
2250000	2257000	I really want to read this text out loud, just so you all get to hear exactly what I had to read, but also so I don't miss anything.
2257000	2264000	Grayson is going on camera shortly, to finally tell the world how you tried to molest him and touch him in his sleep,
2264000	2268000	and made him uncomfortable for months, you sick motherfucker.
2268000	2272000	Next, Zach will be going on camera to tell how twisted and sick you were,
2272000	2277000	trying to get him to like you and then make him feel bad when he didn't want to send you photos back.
2278000	2284000	Then, Sam from Seattle will be joining me and Cameron to talk about you trapping him in his hotel room.
2284000	2288000	You need to be locked in prison for a very long time.
2288000	2293000	You need the internet taken away from you. You are a danger to society.
2294000	2297000	This was something else. Jeffree Star did this.
2297000	2299000	This is disgusting. It is defamatory.
2299000	2308000	It is actually shocking that someone with Jeffree's stars, clout, and power would ever send something like that without the actual evidence to back it up.
2308000	2313000	He just accused someone of attempting to molest Grayson Dolan. What?
2313000	2318000	This is where I really started to feel for James' case, because this is just too far.
2318000	2322000	Jeffree also sent a message to James' friend too, which is just insane.
2322000	2326000	And on top of this, he seems so nice to his accusers who've peddled this narrative.
2326000	2335000	First and foremost, I do want to issue a thank you to both Jeffree and Tati for taking some of the responsibility, for blowing this whole thing up, and for starting everything.
2335000	2343000	I really respect that a lot, and I also appreciate the fact that they are trying to redirect the hate away, because I think we're all aware at this point that it has gotten way too far.
2343000	2348000	If I've known anything about Tati over the past three years, it's that she has a huge, huge heart.
2348000	2354000	There's no denying that, and I think that, or I do believe her when she says that she did not want this to get so vile.
2354000	2358000	I don't really think any of us thought it was going to be as big as it really was.
2358000	2362000	Why would he do this? Well, maybe one more twist was around the corner.
2362000	2371000	As in response to the video, Jeffree put out multiple tweets stating that he had evidence, he had receipts, and Tati implied that James was thoroughly dishonest.
2371000	2377000	I mean, there have been so many twists and turns in this saga, we were ready for more, right? What did we get?
2377000	2387000	There was a lot happening behind the scenes, and I think today I would like to shed some light on the entire experience,
2387000	2394000	because I think that things are getting crazy, dangerous, and we need to have a conversation.
2395000	2397000	Hmm...
2403000	2410000	Emerging subscribers, and with the anticipation on him to expose James Charles' lies, Jeffree Star released his video,
2410000	2417000	Never Doing This Again. It revealed absolutely nothing, and left me feeling rather irritated.
2417000	2425000	Likewise, it left some people in the community rather satisfied, because as soon as he released it, he began gaining back the respect and subscribers that he had lost.
2425000	2434000	Now, most of you have seen some brutal tweets that I sent out last week, a lot of you have seen the vicious text messages that I sent,
2434000	2441000	and I want to let you understand something. Because I said those things, that does not equal me hating James Charles.
2441000	2452000	I sat there yesterday, and I started to get really angry, I was going to pull voice memos, I was going to pull old text messages from other people that don't want to be involved,
2452000	2458000	and I was just getting into a place where it wasn't healthy, okay?
2458000	2468000	Today, I know what people want. They want me to sit here and degrade James, they want me to open up my phone and expose it all.
2468000	2475000	I'm done doing that, and it may be shocking, some of you may be like, oh you're just trying to save your own ass, are you a liar, are you this?
2475000	2485000	I'm willing to bite the bullet and let anyone think what they want, but today I will not be posting voice memos, I will not be posting text messages,
2485000	2490000	I will not be exposing anything more, this has to stop.
2490000	2497000	Did I jump the gun on a situation that I didn't fully understand and chime in? Absolutely, and I am living with that every day.
2497000	2501000	There's a lot of questions about my tweets, and I want to say that I regret them.
2501000	2510000	I don't regret much in my life, but I regret hitting the send button because they were bigger and louder than I ever imagined,
2510000	2517000	and it made things worse when I could have handled things privately, and that is something that I'm working on.
2517000	2523000	I'm embarrassed of myself, I'm embarrassed for my family that they have to see things online,
2523000	2531000	and I'm sad that Nathan and my friends have to go online and deal with this as well because of my actions.
2531000	2539000	I know who I am, and this beauty community right now is suffering, and I'm really sad that everything is going on,
2539000	2546000	and I know that may be hard to believe because there are so many people that have opinions, they think that I get off on drama,
2546000	2555000	and anytime there's a situation, I insert myself, it's been a really quiet year for me, and I didn't want this to happen,
2555000	2556000	and I should have known better.
2556000	2562000	In the video, he basically stated that although he could release evidence, he won't, because he's so virtuous
2562000	2568000	and doesn't want to stoke the bitter fire of drama that is currently burning, because it could cause so much pain.
2568000	2573000	I mean, he has voice members that could destroy James Charles and all the disgusting things he's done,
2573000	2579000	but he's not gonna release them because we all need time to heal, in spite of the fact that he's an alleged danger to society.
2579000	2585000	I hate to get all overly moral about this, but I believed in better from these people, my mistake.
2585000	2593000	Such a huge proportion of the LGBT community have to suffer through sexual assault, and given how prominent the LGBT community is in the beauty community,
2593000	2598000	you'd think they'd be a bit more sensitive to throwing around allegations like they're paper planes.
2598000	2601000	I'm not in the beauty community, so this video will have very little impact.
2601000	2607000	It's a takeaway for all my viewers who choose to watch it, but I really feel that Jeffree Star overstepped a line here.
2607000	2614000	He not only threatened James Charles with evidence that he refuses to release, the allegations themselves related to sexual assault,
2614000	2617000	personal to me, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.
2617000	2623000	When Tati's video came out, I was open to some of the claims, and until James' response, I defended the possibility of them,
2623000	2626000	because such behaviour is a serious matter.
2626000	2630000	James was fairly quiet for a few days, and I believed in better from a community that seeks to empower people.
2630000	2636000	After Jeffree's video, I was annoyed, and expected a more volatile reaction for such a transparent act of manipulation,
2636000	2641000	and instead, James accepted them back with open arms. It is unsettling.
2641000	2645000	And let's get this clear, the reason that this was patched up so quickly was because of business.
2645000	2650000	It was more beneficial for them that they resolve their differences right now, and I understand that,
2650000	2653000	but ultimately, that's what confused me about this situation.
2653000	2657000	Tati has been a person with a level of credibility. She's done so well for herself.
2657000	2662000	I gave her the benefit of the doubt for a long time because I could not imagine her lying.
2662000	2667000	I also gave her the benefit of the doubt because James Charles is an icon, with a ton of people backing him,
2667000	2670000	and therefore every single claim she'd make would have to be true.
2670000	2675000	It didn't make sense to me that she'd lie because even if James Charles was an unstable mess,
2675000	2681000	there was no way that the numerous people behind him wouldn't help him form some sort of coherent response,
2681000	2685000	and he did, but it still bemuses me why they released that video in the first place.
2685000	2688000	I guess I was wrong, but it still doesn't add up every now and then.
2688000	2694000	I just think it's a ruse for Shane Dawson's documentary or some social experiment or mob mentality,
2694000	2696000	because honestly, that would make more sense.
2696000	2700000	But then I realised that you were dealing with scenarios that heaped huge subscriber damage,
2700000	2706000	and I think it has to be legit right. No one would conspire to carry such a forced thing out.
2706000	2709000	In one of his texts, Jeffery compares James to Manny.
2709000	2712000	You can't discard James Charles like you would Manny or Laura Lee,
2712000	2718000	because James Charles has an undeniable appeal that transcends scandal, as seen again and again,
2718000	2721000	which is why he was growing at an unassailable rate.
2721000	2725000	Either this is a ruse, or Tati and Jeffery really aren't as smart,
2725000	2729000	or they knew the audience would come back, which it appears they might be,
2729000	2731000	but it's still a bit up in the air,
2731000	2736000	and it also annoys me that they would begin to throw around such allegations as ammunition for petty drama.
2736000	2739000	As mentioned, there are a lot of victims in the community.
2739000	2743000	It seems so insensitive that Jeffery would even consider sending such a threat,
2743000	2748000	but maybe because the community is so inherently dramatic, these things carry less gravity.
2748000	2751000	It's disappointing that such vindictive behaviour is validated,
2751000	2754000	because the community is already vindictive enough,
2754000	2757000	and even though James Charles may emerge with a few scratches and bruises,
2757000	2761000	whoever is subjected next to the drama may not have the same courtesies,
2761000	2764000	because by then, it'll all be boring to the outside world.
2764000	2767000	The beauty community is a community like no other.
2767000	2770000	Creators have gone out to destroy each other's careers,
2770000	2772000	and yet have had them emboldened.
2772000	2775000	The one really interesting take that I'd like to finish on
2775000	2779000	is that you can have all the circumstantial evidence to corroborate a story,
2779000	2780000	and that was the case for Tati.
2780000	2782000	She had so many boxes ticked,
2782000	2785000	but going to the store isn't the same as getting the receipt,
2785000	2787000	and when it came to the cold, hard evidence,
2787000	2790000	James had it, and yet we were all led on,
2790000	2794000	because the explanation appealed to our biases and made sense.
2794000	2796000	But when it came down to the line, we were misled,
2796000	2800000	and although they may have patched it up, a sour taste may linger.
2800000	2802000	For me it does, at least.
2809000	2810000	So yes, that's the video.
2810000	2812000	Worked hard on this one, been on the grind.
2812000	2815000	Of course, if there are new developments, I might have to make another one,
2815000	2820000	but obviously, it's only gonna be if it's significant enough to necessarily turn the tide,
2820000	2823000	and I don't really like making multiple videos on one situation,
2823000	2825000	but I guess that does come across in my content a little.
2826000	2827000	I would love to hear your thoughts nonetheless,
2827000	2832000	I would love to give a big shout out to the editors who have once again done a fantastic job.
2836000	2840000	I also need to give a big thanks to my Patreons on screen right now,
2840000	2841000	thank you for your generosity,
2841000	2845000	and also my $50 Patreon, Sumhala Baloo, thank you again,
2845000	2850000	and my $100 Patreons, Brandon and Evening Steel, thank you very much.
2850000	2854000	The generosity is really appreciated, especially when times get tricky with YouTube,
2854000	2857000	they're being a bit dickie recently, I don't like them again.
2857000	2860000	I don't really have too much else to say, if you need to, hit me up,
2860000	2864000	Twitter, at The Right Opinion, Facebook, Discord, I'm in those too,
2864000	2868000	you can get me wherever, that sounded a bit weird, but who cares.
2868000	2872000	But until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you in the next one.
2884000	2893000	Thanks for watching!
