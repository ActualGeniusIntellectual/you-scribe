0	5520	When people look back on YouTubers and ask themselves who have been the most influential creators on the platform,
5520	10880	there are many individuals that I'm sure come to mind, people who are relevant now, and people who used to be relevant,
10880	18320	whether it's PewDiePie, Smosh, Shane Dawson, Nigahiga, Ray William Johnson, Fred, The Annoying Orange, and so on.
18320	22480	Many creators, past and present, have had a significant cultural impact.
22480	27520	However, when speaking to people about their childhood, one name that seldom seems to come up is
27520	34560	Toby Turner, or Tobuscus, or Toby Games, despite the fact that I'm sure a huge number of people have watched at least one video of his,
34560	40880	two of his channels have amassed over 6 million subscribers each, which is certainly a feat not to be overlooked.
40880	47600	Yet I feel that his story is one that is often overlooked, one that is heavily integrated in the culture that we discuss today,
47600	53600	and one that we can perhaps learn a bit from, and maybe seek to explain how Toby Turner ended his career.
53600	59840	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time, and bless your face.
59840	66800	I'm sure not everyone is aware of who Toby Turner is, but for a basic rundown, he is one of the original creators on the platform,
66800	73760	who began his craft in 2006, and 12 years later is still going. As mentioned, however, it's not with the intensity that he used to,
73760	79680	after he probably made a fat stack of cash in his time, or at least enough to keep him going, I can't look into a man's bank account.
79760	85600	He ascended to his peak around the turn of the 2010s, particularly encompassed by the success of his literal trailer series.
85600	90880	On top of this, he also had a gaming channel, in which he would achieve even greater success in terms of subscribers,
90880	97600	in spite of a marginally lower view count. Generally, if you ask someone involved with YouTube what has been their most recent experience with him,
97600	102160	chances are it'll be the allegations, in which Toby Turner was accused of sexual assault.
102160	109040	Now, at the time, this was created in a Tumblr post by an individual named April Fletcher, and this information isn't wholly relevant right now,
109040	112160	but I am going to bring it back up in the future for why it is important.
112160	117920	Turner had three successful channels, have made videos that are pretty much iconic in many people's childhoods,
117920	123520	and had so much media branching out in so many different directions, he almost seemed set to succeed.
123520	130640	I was rewatching a video in preparation by FootofaFerret, in which he runs down the brief history of our good friend Toby here, and he says this.
130640	152720	So it does indeed beg the question, what the hell happened? Even I'm not entirely sure yet, but by the end of the video, I'm sure we'll have a bit more of a definitive answer.
152720	160560	Turner is still uploading content to this day on his channel, mostly more commentary, facecam oriented, and talking about various random topics that interest him,
160560	167760	some topics more trending, others more spontaneous or personal to him. Given the fact that I don't think there's really too much else to summarise in this situation,
167760	172480	we're running ahead of schedule, so without further ado, I suggest we get right into it.
173440	183280	I think we should open up with a fairly uncontroversial statement. Toby Turner is a talented musician.
183280	191680	There is no doubt in my mind about that, he started his Tabuscus channel in 2006, and it did decently, in fact it did fairly well, particularly for views.
191680	200720	Turner's music always had a very distinct style in its delivery, Turner is a guitarist, he's clearly no Van Halen, or else Daddy Derek would have probably wanted his signature,
200720	208960	but he didn't need to be, and that's the first thing we need to talk about when it comes to Turner as a creator. Nothing he made was profoundly musically expert,
208960	217360	but it didn't need to be. The thing is, back in 2006, YouTube existed on its own terms, its content creators didn't have state of the art camera work,
217360	225120	and I know I've spoken about this before, but if it's a premise, it can't be ignored. Turner's stuff was relatively simple at the time, but it was cute,
225120	228320	it was mildly amusing, and Turner could do funny voices.
235680	242880	A lot of people tend to point to the Don't Taze Me Bro as one of Turner's earliest successes, but I'm not sure I entirely agree with that,
242880	251920	and I'd actually say that a far more representative video is the quaintly named Falcor the Urinator, which is essentially a song about his dog and how it pisses,
251920	260400	which, you know, fair enough. I feel that as a video, it was a snapshot into what Turner was about to create, and how mind-blowingly successful he was about to become.
260400	270560	You see, the word meme didn't even begin becoming popularised until the early 2010s, and even then it was a very gradual ascension to the sort of notoriety that it has attained today,
270560	278960	but with all this considered, the phrase meme is just a label. Memes existed before the word meme existed. Nowadays memes are much more seen as general concepts,
278960	287200	and we tend to pick up on the most random people, but I think one of the things I'd argue about Turner is that he really did make his music in a very meme-y fashion.
287200	296880	If you go back and look in the comment sections, you'll see numerous people quoting very iconic parts of the song, because they had something unique about them that made them so inherently quotable.
296880	306240	What was that exactly though? Generally I think it was because as a musician he was also a storyteller, which you know is kinda hard to recognise when you're distracted by the numerous jokes,
306320	312320	and maybe this was equally born out of his skits, where he would create an arc, even if it was a fairly irrelevant one.
312320	321120	But that's what a lot of his music represented, that arc, with a load of punchlines in between, which often yielded from the lines before, thus delivering some sort of comedic emphasis.
321120	327200	Combine this with the melodies, and the very awkward timing, it seemed to create something humorous and memorable.
327200	333440	He would also find comedy in the very simple notion of being literal. Even in his Falco video, you can see that style.
333440	343200	You're relating on the carpet, Napa-nating on the pee pad, to-a-nating the sofa.
343200	349120	Typically this would contrast a very simple formula, bringing energy and epicness to something mundane.
349120	357360	The song is about a dog who takes a piss and chews up sofas, but suddenly it's become this huge song about the dragon from the never-ending story.
357360	365760	Turner also enjoyed relative success from his remixes, even though they probably didn't give him the greatest persona, and they didn't really necessarily build character.
365760	371920	They're really only worth noticing from the point of view that they showed Turner's very intuitive nature to the prevailing trends.
371920	381760	On the about page of his extremely outdated website, it describes him as a viral marketer slash actor, instead of, you know, a YouTuber, which I found rather interesting.
381840	388320	But he definitely is very sharp on the direction of trends and working out how to turn them into something that people wanted to see.
388320	392480	The remixes themselves weren't really anything particularly groundbreaking in their quality,
403920	409600	but he knew how to put them out there, and he knew how to make it look appealing to the viewer, so you can't fault him for that.
409600	416400	One thing that Turner was always credited for was his clickbait, which I personally don't think is anything on the level of people like Ray William Johnson,
416400	420960	but his titling was pretty good and always knew how to mould itself into a prevailing trend.
420960	426800	It's also important to note that in spite of his videos doing incredibly well for views, he didn't gain too many subscribers from it,
426800	436800	mainly because at this point, as a creator, although he definitely had his own brand, he hadn't really integrated anything personal into it that would make people come back consistently for his content.
436800	442880	It's a very interesting concept, which is personality. When you subscribe to someone, you typically want to see more of them.
442880	449120	Turner, at that point, had created a very diverse range of content that people were watching mainly for its own virality,
449120	456800	which isn't the same as someone subscribing to some twat ranting about whatever YouTuber talking bare shit of reasons, and giving some opinion to it.
456800	464720	Virality doesn't translate into long-term success. Unless you really carve out a niche that only you can fill, for example, like bad lipreading,
464720	472560	it's very hard to kickstart a brand. What Turner was doing at this time was something that hadn't quite defined him as the creator that he would soon become.
472560	480240	It was also the case because back then there were fewer users on the platform, fewer people who actually had accounts, so with all that considered, he still did alright.
480240	489120	Towards the end of 2009, he was the 73rd most subscribed comedian on the platform, on the grand total of 73,456 subscribers.
489200	496800	Oh, how times have changed. But nonetheless, that's still a fraction of what he was about to obtain, and he really did need something to identify his brand with.
496800	502960	A lot of his videos were fine enough, but they were fairly sporadic in their tone, and that identifies a problem that I'll probably talk about later.
502960	511840	For now, we see Tobuscus in a reasonable position. He's doing well for himself. He has a second and third channel, in which he is enticing many of his current viewers into.
511840	521280	At that point, the third channel was just called Toby, but it appears that he never decided to use that one beyond a couple uploads, and then transferred the status of the third channel onto Toby Games.
521280	527520	This led to a good dynamic interaction. Another YouTuber who had a similar setup was Shane Dawson, who I've spoken about before.
527520	537520	He also had three channels, but there was more divergence in how these two characters used their channels, with Turner making the second channel more dedicated to vlogs, with the third becoming his gaming channel.
537520	547840	Going back to 2010, Turner wasn't the most successful creator on the platform, but with a ruthless scheme of tapping into the most popular pulse, and some fairly iconic ideas he was about to be.
547840	550400	I think it's time we talk about Phase 2.
554000	563440	It is the turn of the decade. The world is changing, and Turner had definitely established something, but he didn't necessarily have that game changer that defined his brand on the Tobuscus channel.
563440	567120	He was doing well, but he could do better. We've all been in that position.
567120	572880	On the 8th of December 2009, Toby Turner uploaded a literal trailer for the film Clash of the Titans.
572880	578640	It basically represented his brand of humour that we'd seen before, but in a form of commentary on a film preview.
578640	588880	Generally, I think this one was a bit more focused on the literal side, but it still represented the inception of something, and demonstrated why Turner had such a talent for the application of this idea.
588880	601600	You see, Turner had a great hold on what's our brand narrative cohesion. The idea that you can maintain a flow of a video like this, insert the jokes, elicit the audience response, while not having to stop the video and say,
601600	608160	guys, look at my joke. Alongside this, the musical nature of many trailers complimented his very melodic style.
608160	618240	His content never had too much of an overbearing personality, and therefore his literal trailers tended to be that perfect balance of something additional without detracting from the source material.
618240	626080	It was a transformative experience that didn't lose sight of the content that draws people in, because that is the balance of that sort of content that you need.
626080	637520	People will inevitably click on a video for a topic or a concept, and decide whether they want to stay for the sake of what the YouTuber is providing in addition to it or not, or if they are providing something wholly original.
637520	642960	And this idea of the literal trailer was something that Turner was able to brand as much more quintessentially his.
642960	651760	However, this video didn't initially take off, not like some of his other content at least, and other videos that had come out about that time had performed better on his channel,
651760	656560	a couple months after, and it had done decently, but nothing was going to necessarily blow up.
656560	665680	But like the ruthless viral marketer he was, he probably knew that he had something. Maybe he received an optimistic fan response, or maybe he just had an instinct.
665680	672720	So like any trooper, he did a few more, and they did well. They didn't blow up, but they were a good enough indication that he might be onto something here.
672720	680720	At the time, he was also doing something known as commercial parodies, which were another good way to really make the most of his comedic timing, and the funny voices he could use.
680720	685360	It's the sort of content that's pretty casual, but really summed up the mood of YouTube back then.
685360	692480	There were a lot of parody channels that could do that low-budget satire. Nowadays, it probably wouldn't fly too high, but I can see the appeal.
692480	700800	Farmville! From milking cows to putting chickens in coops, this game pushes the limits of the imagination backwards!
700800	702800	Here's a taste of the action.
708800	714880	Now, I want to talk about narrative cohesion back here, because the parody series, although short-lived, did outline something.
714880	722880	Toby definitely had a nature to make more mature jokes. Not necessarily sexual, but jokes that you'd have to be somewhat knowledgeable to fully appreciate.
722880	729600	Play Mafia Wars! Duh! If you thought Farmville was exciting, get ready for a ride into the carpal tunnel.
729600	738160	But because they aided the narrative, or they worked in the context of the video, whether you saw them as a joke or not didn't matter. You could still relatively understand.
738160	746160	It also helped that this delivery was quite fast, because it didn't linger on the punchlines. Each video was on its journey, and the jokes were almost like the pit stops.
746160	756320	They enhance the experience, but they don't define it. At the same time, a lot of the jokes that Toby tended to make typically refer to some sort of general human condition, which is always welcome.
756320	763760	But there's only so many punchlines behind the sort of Facebook games, and eventually he moved on from these, even though the views they pulled weren't fairly respectable.
763760	772720	With content like the literal trailers, they in a way reproduced themselves with the constant run of new trailers that came out, and given how each one of them would be different in a way,
772720	777840	he had what seemed to be an endless stream of content that could be covered, he just needed a breakthrough.
777840	785760	Now one of the observations that I made when looking over the previous screencaps of his channel was the clickbait that I had heard some people discuss in the past.
785760	796480	Initially, he branded them as just the HD literal trailers, which plays off a very clever ambiguity of the definition of literal, and obviously the fact that many people were looking for HD content back then,
796480	806240	but it is extremely successful clickbait. However, when he uploaded the Harry Potter literal trailer and it took off, it appears he did change everything to include the parody phrases in the title,
806240	814800	so I mean, you can't really complain too much. Eventually, that became part of the brand. Once again, he's a bit clickbaity, but nothing that I find all that egregious,
814880	823200	especially when you look at the climate, past and present. As literal trailers themselves, you can see a clear improvement with the Harry Potter video.
823200	831760	There are more running jokes, but once again, they don't interfere with the flow. I'm eating Cheez-Its right now, and I'm trying to work out how to explain why as comedy they worked in the time,
831760	837600	but damn these Cheez-Its are good. White Cheddar. White Cheddar is really delicious, guys. Alright, focus, James.
837600	844480	Remember what I said about Falcor, that skill in being able to contrast the mundane with the epicness. With the literal trailers, it's like that,
844480	851120	but amped up to eleven, added on top of the fact that they are parodying something that is already there. You have this huge epic trailer,
851120	858960	and then you have this twat, pointing out details and being pedantic. It's a very simple formula, but it worked, particularly on circa 2010 YouTube.
858960	868320	Once the literal trailers caught fire, it felt like they were what launched Tabuscus as a brand, beyond just the video. People become attached to the guy behind the content,
868320	877280	rather than just the individual uploads, and every single one of the videos that he dropped in the moment appeared to bang, and after the success of the Harry Potter video,
877280	886160	and the follow-up Halo video, the algorithm was poised to launch him into the spotlight with the Assassin's Creed literal trailer, which went absolutely wild in views.
886160	894640	At this point, he knew he had something, but he needed to establish a close relationship with the audience, so one of the series he started out was Cute When Failed,
894640	902400	basically a series where he'd show three clips, one cute, one win, and one fail, and let the audience decide which they took preference to.
902400	905680	I'll let Toby explain in 2010 language what it meant.
905680	910240	A show where videos from three different realms of viral compete to become the most epic.
910240	913040	But Toby, how do you determine which video's the most epic?
913040	915840	I'm glad you asked, guy with crazy hand movements. You decide.
915840	921600	The most epic video of the week receives a gold star, and the other two are then crushed to smithereens by giant rockstone text.
921600	922880	Epic win!
922880	924880	Those videos' lives are in your hands, basically.
924880	930160	One of the people Toby worked with was Jacksfilms, who is also known for the highly interactive content,
930160	937920	and although I can't really confirm whether they were acquainted at this point in their career, I feel that this content did echo the sort of attitude of Jack's work,
937920	943840	and served as a way to try and capitalise on the creative success of his other material, by involving his audience more.
943840	949360	Once again, you have that with Jacksfilms, you have his more creative side, and you have his more personal side.
949360	953760	Also, at the end of literal trailers, he'd have the audience decide which videos were next.
953760	958480	It's the sort of thing that is a smart move to do, and encourage participation from your viewers.
958480	965600	I don't think that any of this is a criticism, in fact, I think it's perfectly reasonable to want to do this, and these videos perform well too.
965600	972400	Obviously, they weren't doing as well as his literal trailers, but that content was what he saw himself as promoting a longevity about.
972400	980080	He made other videos too, chatting bare shit, you know, the sort of thing that he wanted to do, and in a way, that was in the spirits of 2010's YouTube.
980080	985120	It was broadcasting yourself in whatever form possible, and Tobuscus really nailed that.
985120	991920	At around the turn of the 2010's, Tobuscus also started focusing on his two other channels, Toby Turner and Toby Games.
991920	996400	Both of these channels didn't do insane numbers on startup, but they had a fanbase.
996400	1006560	Toby Games is the one that is more interesting, he started at the end of 2010, and immediately it seemed to do somewhat decently, initiating with some videos on Halo Reach.
1006560	1013680	However, there was a lot more to come for this channel, and I want to hold onto this thought as we move into Toby's creative renaissance.
1026400	1036240	You see, by the looks of things, his content was doing what it needed to do. He had a lot of creative ideas, he was letting them run riot on YouTube,
1036240	1044800	an array of ventures all over the place, and people were watching them. However, given Turner's sheer spontaneity, and his nature to just do whatever he wanted to,
1044800	1052320	it meant that if he was going to do something, no one could really tell, and needless to say, no one was prepared for what was coming next,
1052320	1056480	because four words would define many people's lives forever.
1056480	1060400	Nugget. In. A. Biscuit.
1060400	1061760	Woah! Woah! Woah!
1061760	1066160	Nugget biscuit, nugget in a biscuit, nugget biscuit, nugget in a biscuit!
1066160	1070320	Nugget in a biscuit is something that could only be the product of its time.
1070320	1075360	I've explained all the components of Tobuscus, and all of his talents, the memes, the music, the tone, the narrative,
1075360	1079360	and all of these come together to create something like Nugget in a Biscuit.
1079360	1086240	The sheer peak of creative autonomy, there's no other way to describe it, and that's what often makes the greatest memes in cultural projects,
1086240	1089920	because they are so unbelievably unique that you just can't define them.
1089920	1094080	There's no way to fully explain the moments, but Nugget in a Biscuit was one of them.
1094080	1096720	It's a mesmerising video, what else can be said?
1096720	1102720	Toby also let this ingeniously kick off a new creative venture, which was basically animated Tobuscus.
1102720	1108160	Now this is an animated series voiced predominantly by Turner, and animated by the creator GonzoSSM.
1108160	1112320	These little skits did really well, but there was still more to them than meets the eye.
1112320	1116640	To understand this, we need to talk about Toby Games, Tobuscus' third channel.
1116640	1121040	Now, it's exceptionally rare for a third channel to have more subscribers than someone's main channel,
1121040	1124320	when they provide a high amount of attention to the first channel as well.
1124320	1130000	Obviously, some people might point to Shane Dawson's third channel, but I'd argue that he'd prioritise that over the other two,
1130000	1132240	and thus has made it his main channel in a way.
1132240	1136880	Tobuscus did upload a lot of content to his third channel, and there is no doubt about that.
1136880	1140800	It definitely helped, but his main channel already had a huge head start.
1140800	1141920	How did it catch up?
1141920	1146240	Well firstly, Toby was an epic gamer, and I mean he gamed every day.
1146240	1150960	The upload schedule on his channel was absolutely insane, he was uploading non-stop,
1150960	1154080	so even when he wasn't pulling the views, it was all cumulative.
1154080	1161680	However, another more interesting detail was how his new animated series tended to revolve around topics related to the games he might be playing.
1161680	1165840	So for example, Tobuscus Animated Adventures was about a trip to Dead Island,
1165840	1168160	a game that he also played on his third channel.
1168160	1174720	Or for example, on November 2011, he updated a significant amount of Minecraft videos on his third channel,
1174720	1180800	and then complimented it on the 25th of November with a Minecraft-related song on his main channel.
1180800	1183520	His first channel, in spite of everything else that was going on,
1183520	1188880	was intertwined in games enough to the point that it meant that his third channel really took off,
1188880	1191760	on the basis of algorithms, and of that audience,
1191760	1195920	even though I'd argue his main channel retrospectively was much more iconic,
1195920	1197760	and has videos that were more famous.
1197760	1202400	The content that he released on his gaming channel was more about him as an individual creator.
1202400	1208160	Closer interaction, longer videos, more videos, and the videos themselves were much more focused in their genre.
1208160	1211840	They had an underlying theme, and then people subscribed for that theme,
1211840	1215440	which is likely why eventually the channel accumulated more subscribers,
1215440	1217360	because it was more coherent in its theme,
1217440	1219920	and a lot of the time, that's what people subscribed for.
1219920	1223440	These animated videos were much more successful than any other type of video,
1223440	1227600	and with this, he integrated it with his musical talent for some very popular content.
1227600	1232240	When it came to his music skills, he had a knack of creating extremely simple melodies and rhythms
1232240	1234160	that were mesmerising and addictive,
1234160	1236640	often captured Turner's very polarised tone,
1236640	1242000	where he constantly moved between that extremely over-the-top epicness to the very stoic moments,
1242000	1245040	and GonzoSSM did a great job in capturing that.
1245040	1250400	GONZOSSM'S SINGING
1250400	1253200	Animation can capture that sort of energy like no other,
1253200	1257920	so it's no wonder why these videos were so popular with his viewers and many others as well.
1257920	1262800	On top of this, around 2012, he started to branch out into many other forms of YouTube,
1262800	1264480	which is always a resourceful move.
1264480	1266640	At the end of the day, everyone's channel dies,
1266640	1269760	everyone's channel will have a time where it no longer becomes relevant,
1269760	1272800	and therefore, they need to make sure there's a career beyond that,
1272800	1275360	and so he was in a few TV shows, a few films,
1275360	1279440	he'd already featured on his friend Dane Bodekeimer's channel, The Annoying Orange.
1279440	1280480	Yeah, that gem.
1280480	1283280	Turner was a laborious marketer with a lot of ideas,
1283280	1286320	however, in many situations, it would be easy to accuse him
1286320	1289600	of jumping from trend to trend in a rather disingenuous fashion.
1289600	1292480	How can someone have a passion for that many topics?
1292480	1294880	What makes him stand out from that criticism?
1294880	1298560	Firstly, a lot of his successful content clearly has a lot of personality,
1298560	1302800	and does carry through that energy that can root his content in that draw.
1302800	1306160	With that said, his content was never really fueled by his personality,
1306160	1309600	but more by his talents to apply them to create a character.
1309600	1312160	If you asked who Toby Turner was as a person,
1312160	1315600	well, you'd have trouble defining at least that character from Tobuscus.
1315600	1317040	He's clearly sharp and witty,
1317040	1320240	but that's an energy captured by particular circumstances.
1320240	1321520	With someone like Shane Dawson,
1321520	1325760	you have a very particular character portrait that's been constructed by his content.
1325760	1328560	Turner's content may well be abstracted from his character,
1328560	1332560	but it's so comically inclined that it's very hard to say anything about who he is.
1332560	1334160	Who is Toby Turner as a person?
1334160	1336720	It leaves you with his gaming channel and his vlog channel,
1336720	1340080	the latter one we haven't talked about for reasons that we'll discuss very soon,
1340080	1343840	but the gaming channel, I think, was very well built on the games themselves,
1343840	1346960	and make no mistake, Toby clearly has a talent and a knack,
1346960	1350800	but gaming as a genre has become a lot more restricted in the last few years,
1350800	1353840	and less focusing on the attitudes of the people playing them,
1353840	1357920	and more about relative skill, or excellent clickbait, or playing with Drake.
1357920	1359600	Unless you're CSGO surfing, of course,
1359600	1363200	then all you need to do is put some reaction commentary about Danielle Bregoli over it,
1363200	1364880	and suddenly it becomes fine art.
1364880	1367840	Toby was just a gamer, and that was one of the things,
1367840	1370560	although his creative ventures were certainly unique,
1370560	1373840	he didn't have anything that made the gaming videos stick out.
1373840	1377280	Although he was by no means unfunny or lacking in entertainment value,
1377280	1380480	he equally was just as good as the culture in its time,
1380480	1384080	and that culture quickly became hostile to a lot of YouTube gamers,
1384080	1385840	which is where we reach his vlog channel,
1385840	1389200	because his vlog channel was easily his least popular channel,
1389200	1392880	and although it had a significant amount of subscribers and a lot of uploads,
1392880	1394880	not many of them did particularly well,
1394880	1397440	and even if you arrange it in his most popular order,
1397440	1400960	you have to go through eight videos to find firstly a vlog,
1400960	1403600	but also one that isn't misleading in its title,
1403600	1406080	looking at you Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber,
1406080	1409760	and watching the vlogs, they're just not anything that I would brand as captivating.
1409760	1413360	Toby Turner wasn't necessarily made for the vlogging game in my opinion,
1413360	1417120	and the reason is that I feel that a lot of his videos felt inconsequential,
1417120	1420320	even for creators who I personally don't like, such as Zoella,
1420320	1423760	their videos always felt like they had a purpose or a reason to be there,
1423760	1427120	even if I personally think that purpose was rather forced,
1427120	1429840	it still felt like they were always going somewhere,
1429840	1432320	I just never received that impression from Turner's work.
1432320	1435520	On top of this, the vlogs never felt like they were fully Toby,
1435520	1438320	it always felt like he was holding something back,
1438320	1442240	and what we really need is someone expressing themselves in that situation,
1442240	1444320	no one could ever get the full picture,
1444320	1447920	we knew who Tabuscus was, but we didn't really know Toby Turner.
1447920	1452800	But that was alright, it just meant that he may not be cut out for one sort of artistic venture,
1452800	1455040	it just meant he had a brand to preserve,
1455040	1459440	but doing something like that in the changing environment is much easier said than done.
1468320	1475360	You see, I mentioned a couple people in this video today,
1475360	1476800	Dawson and Jacksfilms.
1476800	1479680	The reason that I did this is because they, both as creators,
1479680	1481760	are still going relatively strong to this day,
1481760	1484480	and still make videos that generate a ton of views,
1484480	1487440	and therefore there must be something that distinguishes themselves,
1487440	1490480	and has allowed them to succeed where Turner has fallen short.
1490480	1493200	And don't worry, we'll address the elephant in the room soon enough,
1493200	1495600	but by now it should be clear that the gaming channel,
1495600	1497440	as good as it may have been back in the day,
1497440	1499360	didn't really have the power to survive.
1499360	1502000	The success of the gaming channel was at a peak
1502000	1506400	where his sort of supplementary character was considered an enhancement by audiences,
1506400	1509760	and now that sort of persona was just no longer considered cool,
1509760	1514080	no longer could a large YouTuber just set up a games channel and expect it to do well.
1514080	1516400	However, Tabuscus itself was a unique brand,
1516400	1519200	and even if Turner himself wasn't the most standout person,
1519200	1522960	Tabuscus sure was, and he knew how to creatively define himself.
1522960	1524720	So what was going to tear that down?
1524720	1527040	Well, I think it was a combination of factors,
1527040	1530080	but we'll get the simpler explanations out of the way first.
1530080	1534400	As said, I think as a personality, Turner was quite hard to put in a box.
1534400	1536720	He was always known for his performance persona,
1536720	1539440	whereas Jack's films always felt somewhat more grounded,
1539440	1541920	even though it was clearly an exaggeration.
1541920	1545840	Tabuscus was always a persona, even at his most applied.
1545840	1548480	There are some creators who could just do anything they want,
1548480	1549680	and they'd make it appealing.
1549680	1551360	Tabuscus wasn't one of them,
1551360	1553680	and I think that was shown in his cute Win-Fail series,
1553680	1556320	which, although I can understand its appeal at the time,
1556320	1558720	in my opinion, it does not hold up,
1558720	1561440	because as a host, he's just not that entertaining.
1561440	1563520	Tabuscus needed a specific mould,
1563520	1566560	and I think that was most exposed when he tried to be more down to earth
1566560	1568080	in his shows like cute Win-Fail.
1568080	1569760	He was great for memes in the moment,
1569760	1571680	and he made a lot of memorable content,
1571680	1574240	but you can't be defined by your memes.
1574240	1576320	Jack's films makes a lot of great memes for his audience,
1576320	1580000	but he has this iconic, slightly disconnected personality
1580000	1582560	that will transcend whatever content he covers.
1582560	1585600	The existence of the memes is merely a bonus.
1585600	1589120	Turner's personality never seemed to be greater than the memes.
1589120	1591680	That's the best way I can explain it in that sense,
1591680	1594880	and equally, his content never really gave off a sentiment
1594880	1597280	that he had the personality to persist.
1597280	1600240	Once again, cute Win-Fail kind of demonstrated that to me.
1600240	1604080	He's a good enough host, and he's charismatic and entertaining to an extent,
1604080	1606080	and he has a decent sense of humour.
1606080	1608400	My favourite part of that video is that they all shout,
1608400	1610160	Oh, shoot! Oh, shoot!
1610160	1612480	Oh, shoot! Oh, shoot!
1612480	1614880	That's the most powerful swear they could think of in the moment.
1614880	1615440	That's cute.
1615440	1616960	And by cute, I mean fail.
1616960	1617520	Fail!
1617520	1619600	But you can tell he's holding back.
1619600	1621600	In a video that we'll discuss more in length later,
1621600	1624000	DeFranco very interestingly says this.
1624000	1626960	Like many YouTubers, Toby is a different person off-camera.
1626960	1629120	He is just as energetic, but he's a different person.
1629120	1631040	Toby's the kind of guy that when he talks to you,
1631040	1634080	he makes you feel like you're the centre of his universe,
1634080	1636400	that you are the most important thing,
1636400	1638720	that you are so amazing as a person,
1638720	1642720	he can open up for one second and tell you about some pain he has in his life.
1642720	1644800	You form a connection with him and you have a relationship,
1644800	1646400	but that relationship comes with strength.
1646400	1649520	Toby Turner falls in love with anyone that gives him attention,
1649520	1653040	anyone that makes him feel validated as a human being and special.
1653040	1654880	The problem with that is it's a hollow feeling.
1654880	1655680	And this is the thing,
1655680	1657840	even in his videos that are meant to be more personal
1657840	1659760	and videos that are built on that bond,
1659760	1661760	it doesn't necessarily feel that way.
1661760	1665280	Turner's relationship with his audience always felt somewhat distant,
1665280	1667680	and that's easy to do when you have a huge following,
1667680	1670240	but if you can't provide anything else onto that,
1670240	1672320	it will create a lack of investment.
1672320	1674400	The only creators who last on the platform
1674400	1676880	are people who are real cults of personality.
1676880	1679520	With that said, I still think with all this acknowledged,
1679520	1683040	he really did have the literal trailer brand completely held down,
1683040	1684880	and I don't think any lack of character
1684880	1687520	should have prevented him from succeeding with that brand.
1687520	1690400	To this day, you have screen junkies who did honest trailers,
1690400	1692640	and they still pull a great set of views.
1692640	1694880	Why would it stop Turner from succeeding?
1694880	1697040	I mean, we should talk about the algorithm, at least.
1697040	1698960	I think on one hand, it's just a simple case
1698960	1701840	that the last few years hasn't been good for that sort of silly,
1701840	1703680	slightly corny brand of comedy.
1703680	1707040	In fact, comedy has just died of recent as a genre,
1707040	1709920	and it's been replaced firstly by creators who integrate comedy
1709920	1711600	into content with a greater message,
1711600	1715360	or just actual TV comedians who are barging their way onto the platform.
1715360	1717760	And sure, there are still comedians out there like Jacksfilms,
1717760	1721360	but I feel that YouTubers who serve to exist merely as comedians
1721360	1722880	have had a really hard time.
1722880	1725920	Also, the sort of funny voice comedy has died hard.
1725920	1728640	We're coming from an era where Fred and The Annoying Orange
1728640	1730160	were considered entertainment.
1730160	1733120	People's tolerance for those things has nosedived,
1733120	1736080	and although Tabuscus was never to the extent of either of them,
1736080	1737840	which is probably why he lasted longer,
1737840	1740720	his exaggerated voice was still a part of the comedy.
1740720	1744640	As content modernised, his brand didn't seem to be able to keep up.
1744640	1746880	Ask yourself, would Nugget In A Biscuit
1746880	1750240	as legendary as it is go viral if it was released today?
1750240	1754080	And then ask yourself, what could Tabuscus release today to go viral?
1754080	1755440	Nugget In A Biscuit 2?
1755440	1758320	Well, yes, he did that, and it was genius, again,
1758320	1759680	but my point still stands.
1759680	1763280	On top of this, with the whole gaming content kind of dying in the last few years,
1763280	1766160	even if he'd maintained some consistency on his literal trailers,
1766160	1768720	his other content had changed so much that it was unlikely
1768720	1770560	that without something tying it all together,
1770560	1773280	he was ever going to retain a huge amount of his audience.
1773280	1775440	But you see, that's still not the whole story.
1775440	1778480	A little over a year ago, at the end of October 2017,
1778480	1780880	he released another literal Assassin's Creed trailer,
1780880	1782000	and it did very well.
1782000	1784640	I mean, it wasn't going to do the numbers of his previous ones,
1784640	1787840	but still, it's clear that he had modernised it in a way
1787840	1790960	that could make it still appealing to a specific audience.
1790960	1792320	He'd upped the production value,
1792320	1794880	he still had that subtle way of conveying jokes,
1794880	1796960	and he sounded absolutely delicious.
1796960	1799680	Main bad guy won half face reveal,
1799680	1802800	but the masked guy's face remains concealed.
1803440	1805360	He also absolutely nailed Leonard Cohen,
1805360	1808160	which, by the way, you want it darker, bonafide banger.
1808160	1812320	So I don't think his channel had to, quote, die like many people said it did.
1812320	1815280	I think there'll always be a brand for literal trailers.
1815280	1819520	Maybe he's left it too long now, and you know, 2018 was a huge year for games,
1819520	1823200	so really, there must be some active choice involved in not keeping these up.
1823200	1824400	I've looked at a lot of videos,
1824400	1827360	and there might be an explanation deep into one of his streams or somewhere,
1827360	1828560	but I can't find it.
1828560	1831200	It might be to do with YouTube's tightening copyright system,
1831200	1834160	which has been hitting creators hard in the last year, like, really hard,
1834160	1837920	and given that a lot of his content is very tightly integrated with that,
1837920	1840320	I can't see that boding well for his craft,
1840320	1842480	or maybe he just became tired with it.
1842480	1843760	He'd been doing it for years,
1843760	1847520	and there's no point in continuing something that you don't have that passion for.
1847520	1851440	With that said, his channel didn't just exist on the sole brand of trailers,
1851440	1853440	and his follow up to Assassin's Creed,
1853440	1856960	the Red Dead Redemption little trailer didn't do great numbers, honestly,
1856960	1860320	and although there were videos that still performed well in the last couple years,
1860320	1865200	I think you can pinpoint the moment where YouTube threw his channel out of the algorithm in general,
1865200	1867680	and to do that, we have to talk about the allegations.
1877440	1880160	Now, this next part, I'm gonna go a little off-piste,
1880160	1882160	and make some arguments from a personal perception.
1882160	1885120	If you don't feel the same way about Turner, then I think that's fine,
1885120	1889520	but there is a lot of concepts here that we do have to somewhat take a decisive step with,
1889520	1893760	because from a personal perspective, although Tobuscus had a lot of highlights in his career,
1893760	1896800	he never really had any clear, defined legacy,
1896800	1899920	something that he's going to be associated with for the rest of time.
1899920	1903200	The closest he reaches to that, in my opinion, is the literal trailers,
1903200	1904560	and I think it was strong,
1904560	1909760	but I think that all of these crafts were undone by a very pivotal moment in his career.
1909760	1912160	So, on April the 8th, 2016,
1912160	1915040	April Fletcher, also known as YouTuber April F,
1915040	1919040	published a very in-depth post on Tumblr called The Truth About Tobuscus,
1919040	1921440	in which he makes a plethora of claims about Turner,
1921440	1925040	about the abuse she endured from him, both emotional and physical.
1925040	1927360	I'm going to leave a link to the post in the pinned comment,
1927360	1930880	it might be in a Google document, it's under references, as always,
1930880	1932960	just control F it, if you need to.
1932960	1935920	But either way, I'm not going to go into too many details,
1935920	1940160	other than the huge one of which the claim was made that he had actually drugged her,
1940160	1942160	and subsequently sexually assaulted her.
1942160	1946720	This was covered by Keem and by DeFranco, and at the time it was a pretty huge story.
1946720	1950800	There were multiple women who came forward with their testimonies about Turner as a person,
1950800	1952240	each of them differing slightly.
1952240	1955440	There was this general agreement that he clearly had his problems,
1955440	1959760	but the disagreement on Fletcher's testimony came in which many questioned their relationship,
1959760	1964640	including Turner's mother, and his ability to actually drug and subsequently assault someone,
1964640	1969440	and people who knew Turner did tend to say he had habits of being a bit unstable,
1969440	1971600	and Turner even admitted it himself.
1971600	1977520	Because I'm not perfect, and there are a lot of ways I could become a better person.
1977520	1980160	Have I been a bad boyfriend? Sometimes, yeah.
1980160	1983040	Did I party in my 20s? Yes, too much.
1983040	1986960	And so that's what I've been doing, is working on myself.
1986960	1990080	However, this does not mean the more serious claims are true.
1990080	1993520	It can often be that someone might rely on people's inductive assumptions
1993520	1995760	to then make a further claim about the person.
1995760	2000160	This is known as heuristics, and it's very possible that Fletcher knew Turner had a reputation,
2000160	2002480	and thus managed to create new allegations.
2002480	2006080	However, that's just a theory, and it does not mean that Fletcher is lying,
2006080	2009360	but I'm just saying it's not a valid argument to perhaps say
2009360	2012560	that he is capable of something much worse than he has admitted to.
2012560	2015600	At the end of the day, it's an innocent until proven guilty dynamic,
2015600	2020240	and you really have to use your instinct and say what you think in those situations.
2020240	2025040	I think given that Turner's actual personality seems to be one that is more spontaneous and impulsive,
2025040	2028560	and occasionally inappropriate, rather than outright calculated malice,
2028560	2032240	I can't really say that situation is probable, but I don't know him personally,
2032240	2034720	and therefore I do not have a steadfast opinion,
2034720	2038080	and those people who know him better still have a more insightful view.
2038080	2042240	With that said, I think the situation yielded a few unforeseen circumstances,
2042240	2046320	which at the end of the day doesn't mean that they shouldn't be discussed in the first place,
2046320	2049600	but equally, I feel, did occur regardless because of it.
2049600	2053600	Given the fact that Turner as a person was always somewhat distanced from his audience,
2053680	2058640	this was one of the first very personal things that the viewership en masse became acquainted with,
2058640	2063120	and I think that began to hang over him, and like many people when faced down with these claims,
2063120	2066240	Toby took a break from uploading, on his main channel in particular,
2066240	2070080	and he would provide occasional updates on his second channel on how he was doing,
2070080	2073600	notice how the second channel is considered to be the more personal one,
2073600	2077920	and on top of this, it was one of the situations that he covered that did receive views.
2077920	2081600	Keep this in mind, I feel this impacted his channel in the algorithm,
2081600	2085040	and maybe in people's perception too, even if it was subconscious.
2085040	2088640	Before he took a break, all at least cracked a few hundred thousand views,
2088640	2090880	and maybe even a million, or two million.
2090880	2094000	When he came back, he had real trouble capturing that momentum,
2094000	2096480	and even when he did, it did not tend to last.
2096480	2099520	Recently, he has tried to craft more commentary focused material,
2099520	2102480	but I think watching it, it outlines the problem that he always had,
2102480	2107200	as commentary really has to be built on some sort of personal trust between creator and viewer.
2107200	2110400	When I started researching this video, even though I knew the allegations
2110400	2111920	were a significant part of this,
2111920	2115200	I didn't think they would have affected his career on YouTube too much,
2115200	2117440	because at the end of the day, from what I've observed,
2117440	2119920	the original videos and the response videos,
2119920	2123360	there was a significant amount of skepticism that revolved around it,
2123360	2127200	particularly from the audience, and YouTube is a consumer-based market.
2127200	2131520	Like music, for example, a lot of CD individuals have made mega-bank,
2131520	2135680	even after allegations, and even convictions that would have ended their careers
2135680	2137280	in many other industries.
2137280	2140400	But I think the thing is, the allegations, whether true or not,
2140400	2143520	tend to be what many people think of when thinking of him,
2143520	2145680	despite his extensive creative backlog.
2145680	2147920	His most viewed video since the allegations,
2147920	2151440	is a video that came out two years after addressing the allegations,
2151440	2152880	where he also says this.
2152880	2156400	I almost gave up, but I didn't, and I won't.
2158240	2163200	So, give me my f***ing show back, and my book deal for young adults.
2163760	2165280	Stupid lying b****.
2168160	2173200	Which outlines another problem for him going forward as a creator.
2173200	2175040	As said, YouTube channels die.
2175040	2178720	There is no doubt about that, we all have our time to go into the light,
2178720	2182800	but we can normally move outside in less consumer-controlled industries.
2182800	2185040	However, with this situation, they'd likely cut him out
2185040	2188800	due to the reputational damages that he might have been associated with,
2188800	2191040	including a voice part in a Marvel series,
2191040	2194160	and it's undoubtedly going to affect him finding future work.
2194240	2196080	The video is a well-made video,
2196080	2198560	and he does all the right things that you would need to do
2198560	2200160	when addressing these allegations.
2200160	2202640	Once again, it's so hard to know who to believe,
2202640	2205200	even though due process will always prevail.
2205200	2207600	Equally, it raises the question of whether it was best
2207600	2209760	to publicise these claims like they were,
2209760	2211280	rather than just going to the police,
2211280	2213200	and that's another very difficult question.
2213200	2217040	I feel that we live in a world where the consequences of just an allegation
2217040	2219680	are so great that we might risk allowing people to abuse it,
2219680	2222320	but at the same time, when allegations are publicised,
2222320	2225840	it might enable people to come forward and provide corroborating accounts,
2225840	2227520	or even contradictory ones,
2227520	2229600	and the truth should always be the final goal.
2229600	2233600	Sexual assault is also an extremely hard crime to prosecute through the courts of law,
2233600	2236320	because it's often one person's word against another.
2236320	2240880	What we really need to do is work out how to make sure industries and individuals alike
2240880	2244640	don't behave in a reactionary way upon the surfacing of allegations,
2244640	2247440	while at the same time trying to change the communities
2247440	2251120	so that people feel more comfortable coming forward in the present tense.
2251120	2252560	It's an absolute minefield,
2252560	2256160	and you can see how unfortunately Turner was one who trod on the mine.
2256160	2259280	It's a sad end to what really is a prolific career
2259280	2262240	that few speak about with the fondness that you'd expect them to,
2262240	2263120	but you know what?
2263120	2264400	Maybe we shouldn't be sad.
2264400	2268080	He still made a lot of great content that no one else could really do like him,
2268080	2272080	and the quality of that content I am confident will transcend the restraints of time,
2272080	2273040	and for what it's worth,
2273040	2275680	although it's kinda hard to judge how he's doing in his videos,
2275680	2278240	judging by his Instagram, he seems fairly happy.
2278240	2282400	I do think his brand of literal trailers is something that isn't necessarily finished,
2282400	2285200	it's just with channels like Screen Junkies and Honest Trailers,
2285200	2289440	they've kept it going as such a central theme that it's what people keep coming back for.
2289440	2292800	I think a lot of Toby's work has dated, some of which worse than others,
2292800	2295120	but I still think there's a formula that might work here,
2295120	2297600	but if he doesn't want to, he shouldn't have to.
2297600	2300240	At the end of the day, you make the content that makes you happy,
2300240	2302160	that's what YouTube was originally about.
2302160	2304560	Whether that happiness is derived from the content itself,
2304560	2306800	or from something else the content might bring,
2306800	2309440	go and pursue it, don't let your dreams be dreams.
2309440	2313200	Toby Turner is a creative maestro, and there can be no doubt about that,
2313200	2317440	his rise to being one of the most popular YouTubers is rooted in some great ventures
2317440	2318640	that it really paid off,
2318640	2321680	and going in tandem with a gaming channel that subsequently succeeded
2321680	2324560	due to the fact that his personality fit into the sort of mold
2324560	2326160	that people were looking for at the time.
2326160	2330400	However, his content never fully gave people a character portrait they could hold onto,
2330400	2332800	and it was rooted in some superficiality,
2332800	2337520	which is likely why his supposed more personal channel didn't ever fully catch on,
2337520	2340400	maybe because Toby himself had a lot more personal problems
2340400	2342240	he didn't want to project onto the internet,
2342240	2343680	and I don't blame him for that.
2343680	2346640	However, when we did finally address that personality,
2346640	2349120	it was in rather unfortunate circumstances,
2349120	2351280	and I feel that this may have tainted his image,
2351280	2354400	whether people viewed the claims with credibility or not.
2354400	2356000	The algorithms gave him no love,
2356000	2358480	and the only videos that received significant interest
2358480	2362320	are ones that seem like he might be revealing something about a new situation,
2362400	2364960	or trying to recapture a foregone past,
2364960	2366880	and he'll even be aware of that.
2366880	2368800	But most importantly, I want to apologize,
2369600	2372320	because I said something in my video last week,
2372320	2374000	not the last one, that one,
2374000	2376080	I don't want to apologize for anything for, I like that one.
2376080	2378240	In a way, he knows what's defined him,
2378240	2381280	and I don't know with that knowledge where he'll go from here,
2381280	2382800	but I'm not sure he cares.
2382800	2385360	No, the great question that I want to leave is,
2385360	2386400	what will survive?
2386400	2388560	What will be left behind of Toby Turner?
2388560	2391360	I guess that's my parting question for you, the viewer,
2391360	2392560	what will be left behind?
2393840	2398400	This was a long, long, long, long video,
2398400	2400400	but I'd love to hear your thoughts, I really would.
2400400	2401600	I hope you guys have enjoyed it,
2401600	2404320	I worked tirelessly on researching the script,
2404320	2406640	and I hope it gives you something that you can take away.
2406640	2409520	I really want to give a shout out to the editors who've done a fantastic job,
2409520	2411600	you know, really wouldn't be anywhere without them,
2411600	2412800	so please go and check them out,
2412800	2414880	I'm going to leave their links in the pinned comment.

2416480	2420000	you can find my Twitter, my Facebook, my Discord,
2420000	2420880	all that jazz,
2420880	2423600	make sure you can check me out there if you need to.
2423600	2426160	Also, big shout out to my Patreons,

2430800	2433040	who is just unbelievably generous,
2433040	2435840	I mean, it's kind of beautiful, it brings a tear to my eye.
2435840	2437280	I don't really have too much else to say,
2437280	2439200	I hope you guys are doing fantastically,
2439200	2440640	I do as well as I can.
2440640	2441920	Until the next one, however,
2441920	2443200	I'm The Right Opinion,
2443200	2444720	and I'll see you in the next one.
