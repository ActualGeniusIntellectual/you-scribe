00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
When people look back on YouTubers and ask themselves who have been the most influential creators on the platform,

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,880
there are many individuals that I'm sure come to mind, people who are relevant now, and people who used to be relevant,

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:18,320
whether it's PewDiePie, Smosh, Shane Dawson, Nigahiga, Ray William Johnson, Fred, The Annoying Orange, and so on.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,480
Many creators, past and present, have had a significant cultural impact.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,520
However, when speaking to people about their childhood, one name that seldom seems to come up is

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:34,560
Toby Turner, or Tobuscus, or Toby Games, despite the fact that I'm sure a huge number of people have watched at least one video of his,

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,880
two of his channels have amassed over 6 million subscribers each, which is certainly a feat not to be overlooked.

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:47,600
Yet I feel that his story is one that is often overlooked, one that is heavily integrated in the culture that we discuss today,

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,600
and one that we can perhaps learn a bit from, and maybe seek to explain how Toby Turner ended his career.

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,840
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time, and bless your face.

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,800
I'm sure not everyone is aware of who Toby Turner is, but for a basic rundown, he is one of the original creators on the platform,

12
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:13,760
who began his craft in 2006, and 12 years later is still going. As mentioned, however, it's not with the intensity that he used to,

13
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,680
after he probably made a fat stack of cash in his time, or at least enough to keep him going, I can't look into a man's bank account.

14
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,600
He ascended to his peak around the turn of the 2010s, particularly encompassed by the success of his literal trailer series.

15
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,880
On top of this, he also had a gaming channel, in which he would achieve even greater success in terms of subscribers,

16
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,600
in spite of a marginally lower view count. Generally, if you ask someone involved with YouTube what has been their most recent experience with him,

17
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,160
chances are it'll be the allegations, in which Toby Turner was accused of sexual assault.

18
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:49,040
Now, at the time, this was created in a Tumblr post by an individual named April Fletcher, and this information isn't wholly relevant right now,

19
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,160
but I am going to bring it back up in the future for why it is important.

20
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:57,920
Turner had three successful channels, have made videos that are pretty much iconic in many people's childhoods,

21
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,520
and had so much media branching out in so many different directions, he almost seemed set to succeed.

22
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:10,640
I was rewatching a video in preparation by FootofaFerret, in which he runs down the brief history of our good friend Toby here, and he says this.

23
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:32,720
So it does indeed beg the question, what the hell happened? Even I'm not entirely sure yet, but by the end of the video, I'm sure we'll have a bit more of a definitive answer.

24
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:40,560
Turner is still uploading content to this day on his channel, mostly more commentary, facecam oriented, and talking about various random topics that interest him,

25
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,760
some topics more trending, others more spontaneous or personal to him. Given the fact that I don't think there's really too much else to summarise in this situation,

26
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,480
we're running ahead of schedule, so without further ado, I suggest we get right into it.

27
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:03,280
I think we should open up with a fairly uncontroversial statement. Toby Turner is a talented musician.

28
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:11,680
There is no doubt in my mind about that, he started his Tabuscus channel in 2006, and it did decently, in fact it did fairly well, particularly for views.

29
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:20,720
Turner's music always had a very distinct style in its delivery, Turner is a guitarist, he's clearly no Van Halen, or else Daddy Derek would have probably wanted his signature,

30
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:28,960
but he didn't need to be, and that's the first thing we need to talk about when it comes to Turner as a creator. Nothing he made was profoundly musically expert,

31
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:37,360
but it didn't need to be. The thing is, back in 2006, YouTube existed on its own terms, its content creators didn't have state of the art camera work,

32
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:45,120
and I know I've spoken about this before, but if it's a premise, it can't be ignored. Turner's stuff was relatively simple at the time, but it was cute,

33
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,320
it was mildly amusing, and Turner could do funny voices.

34
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,880
A lot of people tend to point to the Don't Taze Me Bro as one of Turner's earliest successes, but I'm not sure I entirely agree with that,

35
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:11,920
and I'd actually say that a far more representative video is the quaintly named Falcor the Urinator, which is essentially a song about his dog and how it pisses,

36
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:20,400
which, you know, fair enough. I feel that as a video, it was a snapshot into what Turner was about to create, and how mind-blowingly successful he was about to become.

37
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:30,560
You see, the word meme didn't even begin becoming popularised until the early 2010s, and even then it was a very gradual ascension to the sort of notoriety that it has attained today,

38
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:38,960
but with all this considered, the phrase meme is just a label. Memes existed before the word meme existed. Nowadays memes are much more seen as general concepts,

39
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:47,200
and we tend to pick up on the most random people, but I think one of the things I'd argue about Turner is that he really did make his music in a very meme-y fashion.

40
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:56,880
If you go back and look in the comment sections, you'll see numerous people quoting very iconic parts of the song, because they had something unique about them that made them so inherently quotable.

41
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:06,240
What was that exactly though? Generally I think it was because as a musician he was also a storyteller, which you know is kinda hard to recognise when you're distracted by the numerous jokes,

42
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,320
and maybe this was equally born out of his skits, where he would create an arc, even if it was a fairly irrelevant one.

43
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:21,120
But that's what a lot of his music represented, that arc, with a load of punchlines in between, which often yielded from the lines before, thus delivering some sort of comedic emphasis.

44
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,200
Combine this with the melodies, and the very awkward timing, it seemed to create something humorous and memorable.

45
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:33,440
He would also find comedy in the very simple notion of being literal. Even in his Falco video, you can see that style.

46
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:43,200
You're relating on the carpet, Napa-nating on the pee pad, to-a-nating the sofa.

47
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:49,120
Typically this would contrast a very simple formula, bringing energy and epicness to something mundane.

48
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:57,360
The song is about a dog who takes a piss and chews up sofas, but suddenly it's become this huge song about the dragon from the never-ending story.

49
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:05,760
Turner also enjoyed relative success from his remixes, even though they probably didn't give him the greatest persona, and they didn't really necessarily build character.

50
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:11,920
They're really only worth noticing from the point of view that they showed Turner's very intuitive nature to the prevailing trends.

51
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:21,760
On the about page of his extremely outdated website, it describes him as a viral marketer slash actor, instead of, you know, a YouTuber, which I found rather interesting.

52
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,320
But he definitely is very sharp on the direction of trends and working out how to turn them into something that people wanted to see.

53
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,480
The remixes themselves weren't really anything particularly groundbreaking in their quality,

54
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:49,600
but he knew how to put them out there, and he knew how to make it look appealing to the viewer, so you can't fault him for that.

55
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:56,400
One thing that Turner was always credited for was his clickbait, which I personally don't think is anything on the level of people like Ray William Johnson,

56
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,960
but his titling was pretty good and always knew how to mould itself into a prevailing trend.

57
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,800
It's also important to note that in spite of his videos doing incredibly well for views, he didn't gain too many subscribers from it,

58
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:16,800
mainly because at this point, as a creator, although he definitely had his own brand, he hadn't really integrated anything personal into it that would make people come back consistently for his content.

59
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,880
It's a very interesting concept, which is personality. When you subscribe to someone, you typically want to see more of them.

60
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,120
Turner, at that point, had created a very diverse range of content that people were watching mainly for its own virality,

61
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,800
which isn't the same as someone subscribing to some twat ranting about whatever YouTuber talking bare shit of reasons, and giving some opinion to it.

62
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:44,720
Virality doesn't translate into long-term success. Unless you really carve out a niche that only you can fill, for example, like bad lipreading,

63
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:52,560
it's very hard to kickstart a brand. What Turner was doing at this time was something that hadn't quite defined him as the creator that he would soon become.

64
00:07:52,560 --> 00:08:00,240
It was also the case because back then there were fewer users on the platform, fewer people who actually had accounts, so with all that considered, he still did alright.

65
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:09,120
Towards the end of 2009, he was the 73rd most subscribed comedian on the platform, on the grand total of 73,456 subscribers.

66
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:16,800
Oh, how times have changed. But nonetheless, that's still a fraction of what he was about to obtain, and he really did need something to identify his brand with.

67
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,960
A lot of his videos were fine enough, but they were fairly sporadic in their tone, and that identifies a problem that I'll probably talk about later.

68
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:31,840
For now, we see Tobuscus in a reasonable position. He's doing well for himself. He has a second and third channel, in which he is enticing many of his current viewers into.

69
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:41,280
At that point, the third channel was just called Toby, but it appears that he never decided to use that one beyond a couple uploads, and then transferred the status of the third channel onto Toby Games.

70
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:47,520
This led to a good dynamic interaction. Another YouTuber who had a similar setup was Shane Dawson, who I've spoken about before.

71
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:57,520
He also had three channels, but there was more divergence in how these two characters used their channels, with Turner making the second channel more dedicated to vlogs, with the third becoming his gaming channel.

72
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:07,840
Going back to 2010, Turner wasn't the most successful creator on the platform, but with a ruthless scheme of tapping into the most popular pulse, and some fairly iconic ideas he was about to be.

73
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,400
I think it's time we talk about Phase 2.

74
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:23,440
It is the turn of the decade. The world is changing, and Turner had definitely established something, but he didn't necessarily have that game changer that defined his brand on the Tobuscus channel.

75
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,120
He was doing well, but he could do better. We've all been in that position.

76
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,880
On the 8th of December 2009, Toby Turner uploaded a literal trailer for the film Clash of the Titans.

77
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,640
It basically represented his brand of humour that we'd seen before, but in a form of commentary on a film preview.

78
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:48,880
Generally, I think this one was a bit more focused on the literal side, but it still represented the inception of something, and demonstrated why Turner had such a talent for the application of this idea.

79
00:09:48,880 --> 00:10:01,600
You see, Turner had a great hold on what's our brand narrative cohesion. The idea that you can maintain a flow of a video like this, insert the jokes, elicit the audience response, while not having to stop the video and say,

80
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,160
guys, look at my joke. Alongside this, the musical nature of many trailers complimented his very melodic style.

81
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:18,240
His content never had too much of an overbearing personality, and therefore his literal trailers tended to be that perfect balance of something additional without detracting from the source material.

82
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:26,080
It was a transformative experience that didn't lose sight of the content that draws people in, because that is the balance of that sort of content that you need.

83
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:37,520
People will inevitably click on a video for a topic or a concept, and decide whether they want to stay for the sake of what the YouTuber is providing in addition to it or not, or if they are providing something wholly original.

84
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:42,960
And this idea of the literal trailer was something that Turner was able to brand as much more quintessentially his.

85
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:51,760
However, this video didn't initially take off, not like some of his other content at least, and other videos that had come out about that time had performed better on his channel,

86
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,560
a couple months after, and it had done decently, but nothing was going to necessarily blow up.

87
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:05,680
But like the ruthless viral marketer he was, he probably knew that he had something. Maybe he received an optimistic fan response, or maybe he just had an instinct.

88
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:12,720
So like any trooper, he did a few more, and they did well. They didn't blow up, but they were a good enough indication that he might be onto something here.

89
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:20,720
At the time, he was also doing something known as commercial parodies, which were another good way to really make the most of his comedic timing, and the funny voices he could use.

90
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,360
It's the sort of content that's pretty casual, but really summed up the mood of YouTube back then.

91
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:32,480
There were a lot of parody channels that could do that low-budget satire. Nowadays, it probably wouldn't fly too high, but I can see the appeal.

92
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:40,800
Farmville! From milking cows to putting chickens in coops, this game pushes the limits of the imagination backwards!

93
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
Here's a taste of the action.

94
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,880
Now, I want to talk about narrative cohesion back here, because the parody series, although short-lived, did outline something.

95
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:02,880
Toby definitely had a nature to make more mature jokes. Not necessarily sexual, but jokes that you'd have to be somewhat knowledgeable to fully appreciate.

96
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:09,600
Play Mafia Wars! Duh! If you thought Farmville was exciting, get ready for a ride into the carpal tunnel.

97
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:18,160
But because they aided the narrative, or they worked in the context of the video, whether you saw them as a joke or not didn't matter. You could still relatively understand.

98
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:26,160
It also helped that this delivery was quite fast, because it didn't linger on the punchlines. Each video was on its journey, and the jokes were almost like the pit stops.

99
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:36,320
They enhance the experience, but they don't define it. At the same time, a lot of the jokes that Toby tended to make typically refer to some sort of general human condition, which is always welcome.

100
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:43,760
But there's only so many punchlines behind the sort of Facebook games, and eventually he moved on from these, even though the views they pulled weren't fairly respectable.

101
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:52,720
With content like the literal trailers, they in a way reproduced themselves with the constant run of new trailers that came out, and given how each one of them would be different in a way,

102
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,840
he had what seemed to be an endless stream of content that could be covered, he just needed a breakthrough.

103
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:05,760
Now one of the observations that I made when looking over the previous screencaps of his channel was the clickbait that I had heard some people discuss in the past.

104
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:16,480
Initially, he branded them as just the HD literal trailers, which plays off a very clever ambiguity of the definition of literal, and obviously the fact that many people were looking for HD content back then,

105
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:26,240
but it is extremely successful clickbait. However, when he uploaded the Harry Potter literal trailer and it took off, it appears he did change everything to include the parody phrases in the title,

106
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:34,800
so I mean, you can't really complain too much. Eventually, that became part of the brand. Once again, he's a bit clickbaity, but nothing that I find all that egregious,

107
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:43,200
especially when you look at the climate, past and present. As literal trailers themselves, you can see a clear improvement with the Harry Potter video.

108
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:51,760
There are more running jokes, but once again, they don't interfere with the flow. I'm eating Cheez-Its right now, and I'm trying to work out how to explain why as comedy they worked in the time,

109
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,600
but damn these Cheez-Its are good. White Cheddar. White Cheddar is really delicious, guys. Alright, focus, James.

110
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:04,480
Remember what I said about Falcor, that skill in being able to contrast the mundane with the epicness. With the literal trailers, it's like that,

111
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:11,120
but amped up to eleven, added on top of the fact that they are parodying something that is already there. You have this huge epic trailer,

112
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:18,960
and then you have this twat, pointing out details and being pedantic. It's a very simple formula, but it worked, particularly on circa 2010 YouTube.

113
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:28,320
Once the literal trailers caught fire, it felt like they were what launched Tabuscus as a brand, beyond just the video. People become attached to the guy behind the content,

114
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:37,280
rather than just the individual uploads, and every single one of the videos that he dropped in the moment appeared to bang, and after the success of the Harry Potter video,

115
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:46,160
and the follow-up Halo video, the algorithm was poised to launch him into the spotlight with the Assassin's Creed literal trailer, which went absolutely wild in views.

116
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:54,640
At this point, he knew he had something, but he needed to establish a close relationship with the audience, so one of the series he started out was Cute When Failed,

117
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:02,400
basically a series where he'd show three clips, one cute, one win, and one fail, and let the audience decide which they took preference to.

118
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,680
I'll let Toby explain in 2010 language what it meant.

119
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,240
A show where videos from three different realms of viral compete to become the most epic.

120
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,040
But Toby, how do you determine which video's the most epic?

121
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,840
I'm glad you asked, guy with crazy hand movements. You decide.

122
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:21,600
The most epic video of the week receives a gold star, and the other two are then crushed to smithereens by giant rockstone text.

123
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,880
Epic win!

124
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,880
Those videos' lives are in your hands, basically.

125
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,160
One of the people Toby worked with was Jacksfilms, who is also known for the highly interactive content,

126
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:37,920
and although I can't really confirm whether they were acquainted at this point in their career, I feel that this content did echo the sort of attitude of Jack's work,

127
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,840
and served as a way to try and capitalise on the creative success of his other material, by involving his audience more.

128
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,360
Once again, you have that with Jacksfilms, you have his more creative side, and you have his more personal side.

129
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,760
Also, at the end of literal trailers, he'd have the audience decide which videos were next.

130
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,480
It's the sort of thing that is a smart move to do, and encourage participation from your viewers.

131
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:05,600
I don't think that any of this is a criticism, in fact, I think it's perfectly reasonable to want to do this, and these videos perform well too.

132
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:12,400
Obviously, they weren't doing as well as his literal trailers, but that content was what he saw himself as promoting a longevity about.

133
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:20,080
He made other videos too, chatting bare shit, you know, the sort of thing that he wanted to do, and in a way, that was in the spirits of 2010's YouTube.

134
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,120
It was broadcasting yourself in whatever form possible, and Tobuscus really nailed that.

135
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,920
At around the turn of the 2010's, Tobuscus also started focusing on his two other channels, Toby Turner and Toby Games.

136
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,400
Both of these channels didn't do insane numbers on startup, but they had a fanbase.

137
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:46,560
Toby Games is the one that is more interesting, he started at the end of 2010, and immediately it seemed to do somewhat decently, initiating with some videos on Halo Reach.

138
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:53,680
However, there was a lot more to come for this channel, and I want to hold onto this thought as we move into Toby's creative renaissance.

139
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:16,240
You see, by the looks of things, his content was doing what it needed to do. He had a lot of creative ideas, he was letting them run riot on YouTube,

140
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:24,800
an array of ventures all over the place, and people were watching them. However, given Turner's sheer spontaneity, and his nature to just do whatever he wanted to,

141
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:32,320
it meant that if he was going to do something, no one could really tell, and needless to say, no one was prepared for what was coming next,

142
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,480
because four words would define many people's lives forever.

143
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,400
Nugget. In. A. Biscuit.

144
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,760
Woah! Woah! Woah!

145
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,160
Nugget biscuit, nugget in a biscuit, nugget biscuit, nugget in a biscuit!

146
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,320
Nugget in a biscuit is something that could only be the product of its time.

147
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,360
I've explained all the components of Tobuscus, and all of his talents, the memes, the music, the tone, the narrative,

148
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,360
and all of these come together to create something like Nugget in a Biscuit.

149
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:06,240
The sheer peak of creative autonomy, there's no other way to describe it, and that's what often makes the greatest memes in cultural projects,

150
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,920
because they are so unbelievably unique that you just can't define them.

151
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,080
There's no way to fully explain the moments, but Nugget in a Biscuit was one of them.

152
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,720
It's a mesmerising video, what else can be said?

153
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,720
Toby also let this ingeniously kick off a new creative venture, which was basically animated Tobuscus.

154
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,160
Now this is an animated series voiced predominantly by Turner, and animated by the creator GonzoSSM.

155
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,320
These little skits did really well, but there was still more to them than meets the eye.

156
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,640
To understand this, we need to talk about Toby Games, Tobuscus' third channel.

157
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,040
Now, it's exceptionally rare for a third channel to have more subscribers than someone's main channel,

158
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,320
when they provide a high amount of attention to the first channel as well.

159
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:50,000
Obviously, some people might point to Shane Dawson's third channel, but I'd argue that he'd prioritise that over the other two,

160
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,240
and thus has made it his main channel in a way.

161
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,880
Tobuscus did upload a lot of content to his third channel, and there is no doubt about that.

162
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,800
It definitely helped, but his main channel already had a huge head start.

163
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,920
How did it catch up?

164
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,240
Well firstly, Toby was an epic gamer, and I mean he gamed every day.

165
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,960
The upload schedule on his channel was absolutely insane, he was uploading non-stop,

166
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,080
so even when he wasn't pulling the views, it was all cumulative.

167
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:21,680
However, another more interesting detail was how his new animated series tended to revolve around topics related to the games he might be playing.

168
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,840
So for example, Tobuscus Animated Adventures was about a trip to Dead Island,

169
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,160
a game that he also played on his third channel.

170
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:34,720
Or for example, on November 2011, he updated a significant amount of Minecraft videos on his third channel,

171
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,800
and then complimented it on the 25th of November with a Minecraft-related song on his main channel.

172
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,520
His first channel, in spite of everything else that was going on,

173
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,880
was intertwined in games enough to the point that it meant that his third channel really took off,

174
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,760
on the basis of algorithms, and of that audience,

175
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,920
even though I'd argue his main channel retrospectively was much more iconic,

176
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,760
and has videos that were more famous.

177
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,400
The content that he released on his gaming channel was more about him as an individual creator.

178
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,160
Closer interaction, longer videos, more videos, and the videos themselves were much more focused in their genre.

179
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,840
They had an underlying theme, and then people subscribed for that theme,

180
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,440
which is likely why eventually the channel accumulated more subscribers,

181
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,360
because it was more coherent in its theme,

182
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,920
and a lot of the time, that's what people subscribed for.

183
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,440
These animated videos were much more successful than any other type of video,

184
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,600
and with this, he integrated it with his musical talent for some very popular content.

185
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,240
When it came to his music skills, he had a knack of creating extremely simple melodies and rhythms

186
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,160
that were mesmerising and addictive,

187
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,640
often captured Turner's very polarised tone,

188
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,000
where he constantly moved between that extremely over-the-top epicness to the very stoic moments,

189
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,040
and GonzoSSM did a great job in capturing that.

190
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,400
GONZOSSM'S SINGING

191
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,200
Animation can capture that sort of energy like no other,

192
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,920
so it's no wonder why these videos were so popular with his viewers and many others as well.

193
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,800
On top of this, around 2012, he started to branch out into many other forms of YouTube,

194
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,480
which is always a resourceful move.

195
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,640
At the end of the day, everyone's channel dies,

196
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,760
everyone's channel will have a time where it no longer becomes relevant,

197
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,800
and therefore, they need to make sure there's a career beyond that,

198
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,360
and so he was in a few TV shows, a few films,

199
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,440
he'd already featured on his friend Dane Bodekeimer's channel, The Annoying Orange.

200
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,480
Yeah, that gem.

201
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,280
Turner was a laborious marketer with a lot of ideas,

202
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,320
however, in many situations, it would be easy to accuse him

203
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,600
of jumping from trend to trend in a rather disingenuous fashion.

204
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,480
How can someone have a passion for that many topics?

205
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,880
What makes him stand out from that criticism?

206
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,560
Firstly, a lot of his successful content clearly has a lot of personality,

207
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,800
and does carry through that energy that can root his content in that draw.

208
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,160
With that said, his content was never really fueled by his personality,

209
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,600
but more by his talents to apply them to create a character.

210
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,160
If you asked who Toby Turner was as a person,

211
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,600
well, you'd have trouble defining at least that character from Tobuscus.

212
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,040
He's clearly sharp and witty,

213
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,240
but that's an energy captured by particular circumstances.

214
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,520
With someone like Shane Dawson,

215
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,760
you have a very particular character portrait that's been constructed by his content.

216
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,560
Turner's content may well be abstracted from his character,

217
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,560
but it's so comically inclined that it's very hard to say anything about who he is.

218
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,160
Who is Toby Turner as a person?

219
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,720
It leaves you with his gaming channel and his vlog channel,

220
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,080
the latter one we haven't talked about for reasons that we'll discuss very soon,

221
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,840
but the gaming channel, I think, was very well built on the games themselves,

222
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,960
and make no mistake, Toby clearly has a talent and a knack,

223
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,800
but gaming as a genre has become a lot more restricted in the last few years,

224
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,840
and less focusing on the attitudes of the people playing them,

225
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,920
and more about relative skill, or excellent clickbait, or playing with Drake.

226
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,600
Unless you're CSGO surfing, of course,

227
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,200
then all you need to do is put some reaction commentary about Danielle Bregoli over it,

228
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,880
and suddenly it becomes fine art.

229
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,840
Toby was just a gamer, and that was one of the things,

230
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,560
although his creative ventures were certainly unique,

231
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,840
he didn't have anything that made the gaming videos stick out.

232
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,280
Although he was by no means unfunny or lacking in entertainment value,

233
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,480
he equally was just as good as the culture in its time,

234
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,080
and that culture quickly became hostile to a lot of YouTube gamers,

235
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,840
which is where we reach his vlog channel,

236
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,200
because his vlog channel was easily his least popular channel,

237
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,880
and although it had a significant amount of subscribers and a lot of uploads,

238
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880
not many of them did particularly well,

239
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,440
and even if you arrange it in his most popular order,

240
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,960
you have to go through eight videos to find firstly a vlog,

241
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,600
but also one that isn't misleading in its title,

242
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,080
looking at you Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber,

243
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,760
and watching the vlogs, they're just not anything that I would brand as captivating.

244
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,360
Toby Turner wasn't necessarily made for the vlogging game in my opinion,

245
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,120
and the reason is that I feel that a lot of his videos felt inconsequential,

246
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,320
even for creators who I personally don't like, such as Zoella,

247
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,760
their videos always felt like they had a purpose or a reason to be there,

248
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,120
even if I personally think that purpose was rather forced,

249
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,840
it still felt like they were always going somewhere,

250
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,320
I just never received that impression from Turner's work.

251
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,520
On top of this, the vlogs never felt like they were fully Toby,

252
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,320
it always felt like he was holding something back,

253
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,240
and what we really need is someone expressing themselves in that situation,

254
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,320
no one could ever get the full picture,

255
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,920
we knew who Tabuscus was, but we didn't really know Toby Turner.

256
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:12,800
But that was alright, it just meant that he may not be cut out for one sort of artistic venture,

257
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,040
it just meant he had a brand to preserve,

258
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:19,440
but doing something like that in the changing environment is much easier said than done.

259
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:35,360
You see, I mentioned a couple people in this video today,

260
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,800
Dawson and Jacksfilms.

261
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,680
The reason that I did this is because they, both as creators,

262
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,760
are still going relatively strong to this day,

263
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,480
and still make videos that generate a ton of views,

264
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,440
and therefore there must be something that distinguishes themselves,

265
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,480
and has allowed them to succeed where Turner has fallen short.

266
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,200
And don't worry, we'll address the elephant in the room soon enough,

267
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,600
but by now it should be clear that the gaming channel,

268
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,440
as good as it may have been back in the day,

269
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,360
didn't really have the power to survive.

270
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,000
The success of the gaming channel was at a peak

271
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,400
where his sort of supplementary character was considered an enhancement by audiences,

272
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,760
and now that sort of persona was just no longer considered cool,

273
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,080
no longer could a large YouTuber just set up a games channel and expect it to do well.

274
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,400
However, Tabuscus itself was a unique brand,

275
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,200
and even if Turner himself wasn't the most standout person,

276
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,960
Tabuscus sure was, and he knew how to creatively define himself.

277
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,720
So what was going to tear that down?

278
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,040
Well, I think it was a combination of factors,

279
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,080
but we'll get the simpler explanations out of the way first.

280
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,400
As said, I think as a personality, Turner was quite hard to put in a box.

281
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,720
He was always known for his performance persona,

282
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,440
whereas Jack's films always felt somewhat more grounded,

283
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,920
even though it was clearly an exaggeration.

284
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,840
Tabuscus was always a persona, even at his most applied.

285
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,480
There are some creators who could just do anything they want,

286
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,680
and they'd make it appealing.

287
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,360
Tabuscus wasn't one of them,

288
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,680
and I think that was shown in his cute Win-Fail series,

289
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,320
which, although I can understand its appeal at the time,

290
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,720
in my opinion, it does not hold up,

291
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,440
because as a host, he's just not that entertaining.

292
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,520
Tabuscus needed a specific mould,

293
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,560
and I think that was most exposed when he tried to be more down to earth

294
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,080
in his shows like cute Win-Fail.

295
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,760
He was great for memes in the moment,

296
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,680
and he made a lot of memorable content,

297
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,240
but you can't be defined by your memes.

298
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,320
Jack's films makes a lot of great memes for his audience,

299
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,000
but he has this iconic, slightly disconnected personality

300
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,560
that will transcend whatever content he covers.

301
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,600
The existence of the memes is merely a bonus.

302
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,120
Turner's personality never seemed to be greater than the memes.

303
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,680
That's the best way I can explain it in that sense,

304
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,880
and equally, his content never really gave off a sentiment

305
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,280
that he had the personality to persist.

306
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,240
Once again, cute Win-Fail kind of demonstrated that to me.

307
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,080
He's a good enough host, and he's charismatic and entertaining to an extent,

308
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,080
and he has a decent sense of humour.

309
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,400
My favourite part of that video is that they all shout,

310
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,160
Oh, shoot! Oh, shoot!

311
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,480
Oh, shoot! Oh, shoot!

312
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,880
That's the most powerful swear they could think of in the moment.

313
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,440
That's cute.

314
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,960
And by cute, I mean fail.

315
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,520
Fail!

316
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,600
But you can tell he's holding back.

317
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,600
In a video that we'll discuss more in length later,

318
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,000
DeFranco very interestingly says this.

319
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,960
Like many YouTubers, Toby is a different person off-camera.

320
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,120
He is just as energetic, but he's a different person.

321
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,040
Toby's the kind of guy that when he talks to you,

322
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,080
he makes you feel like you're the centre of his universe,

323
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,400
that you are the most important thing,

324
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,720
that you are so amazing as a person,

325
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,720
he can open up for one second and tell you about some pain he has in his life.

326
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,800
You form a connection with him and you have a relationship,

327
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,400
but that relationship comes with strength.

328
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,520
Toby Turner falls in love with anyone that gives him attention,

329
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,040
anyone that makes him feel validated as a human being and special.

330
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,880
The problem with that is it's a hollow feeling.

331
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,680
And this is the thing,

332
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,840
even in his videos that are meant to be more personal

333
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,760
and videos that are built on that bond,

334
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,760
it doesn't necessarily feel that way.

335
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,280
Turner's relationship with his audience always felt somewhat distant,

336
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,680
and that's easy to do when you have a huge following,

337
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,240
but if you can't provide anything else onto that,

338
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,320
it will create a lack of investment.

339
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,400
The only creators who last on the platform

340
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,880
are people who are real cults of personality.

341
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,520
With that said, I still think with all this acknowledged,

342
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,040
he really did have the literal trailer brand completely held down,

343
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,880
and I don't think any lack of character

344
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,520
should have prevented him from succeeding with that brand.

345
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,400
To this day, you have screen junkies who did honest trailers,

346
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,640
and they still pull a great set of views.

347
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,880
Why would it stop Turner from succeeding?

348
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,040
I mean, we should talk about the algorithm, at least.

349
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,960
I think on one hand, it's just a simple case

350
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,840
that the last few years hasn't been good for that sort of silly,

351
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,680
slightly corny brand of comedy.

352
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,040
In fact, comedy has just died of recent as a genre,

353
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,920
and it's been replaced firstly by creators who integrate comedy

354
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,600
into content with a greater message,

355
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,360
or just actual TV comedians who are barging their way onto the platform.

356
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,760
And sure, there are still comedians out there like Jacksfilms,

357
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,360
but I feel that YouTubers who serve to exist merely as comedians

358
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,880
have had a really hard time.

359
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,920
Also, the sort of funny voice comedy has died hard.

360
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,640
We're coming from an era where Fred and The Annoying Orange

361
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,160
were considered entertainment.

362
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,120
People's tolerance for those things has nosedived,

363
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,080
and although Tabuscus was never to the extent of either of them,

364
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,840
which is probably why he lasted longer,

365
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,720
his exaggerated voice was still a part of the comedy.

366
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,640
As content modernised, his brand didn't seem to be able to keep up.

367
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,880
Ask yourself, would Nugget In A Biscuit

368
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,240
as legendary as it is go viral if it was released today?

369
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,080
And then ask yourself, what could Tabuscus release today to go viral?

370
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,440
Nugget In A Biscuit 2?

371
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,320
Well, yes, he did that, and it was genius, again,

372
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,680
but my point still stands.

373
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,280
On top of this, with the whole gaming content kind of dying in the last few years,

374
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,160
even if he'd maintained some consistency on his literal trailers,

375
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,720
his other content had changed so much that it was unlikely

376
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,560
that without something tying it all together,

377
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,280
he was ever going to retain a huge amount of his audience.

378
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,440
But you see, that's still not the whole story.

379
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,480
A little over a year ago, at the end of October 2017,

380
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,880
he released another literal Assassin's Creed trailer,

381
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,000
and it did very well.

382
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,640
I mean, it wasn't going to do the numbers of his previous ones,

383
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,840
but still, it's clear that he had modernised it in a way

384
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,960
that could make it still appealing to a specific audience.

385
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,320
He'd upped the production value,

386
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,880
he still had that subtle way of conveying jokes,

387
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,960
and he sounded absolutely delicious.

388
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,680
Main bad guy won half face reveal,

389
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,800
but the masked guy's face remains concealed.

390
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,360
He also absolutely nailed Leonard Cohen,

391
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,160
which, by the way, you want it darker, bonafide banger.

392
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,320
So I don't think his channel had to, quote, die like many people said it did.

393
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,280
I think there'll always be a brand for literal trailers.

394
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,520
Maybe he's left it too long now, and you know, 2018 was a huge year for games,

395
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,200
so really, there must be some active choice involved in not keeping these up.

396
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,400
I've looked at a lot of videos,

397
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,360
and there might be an explanation deep into one of his streams or somewhere,

398
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,560
but I can't find it.

399
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,200
It might be to do with YouTube's tightening copyright system,

400
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,160
which has been hitting creators hard in the last year, like, really hard,

401
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,920
and given that a lot of his content is very tightly integrated with that,

402
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,320
I can't see that boding well for his craft,

403
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,480
or maybe he just became tired with it.

404
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,760
He'd been doing it for years,

405
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,520
and there's no point in continuing something that you don't have that passion for.

406
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,440
With that said, his channel didn't just exist on the sole brand of trailers,

407
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,440
and his follow up to Assassin's Creed,

408
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,960
the Red Dead Redemption little trailer didn't do great numbers, honestly,

409
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,320
and although there were videos that still performed well in the last couple years,

410
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,200
I think you can pinpoint the moment where YouTube threw his channel out of the algorithm in general,

411
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,680
and to do that, we have to talk about the allegations.

412
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,160
Now, this next part, I'm gonna go a little off-piste,

413
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,160
and make some arguments from a personal perception.

414
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,120
If you don't feel the same way about Turner, then I think that's fine,

415
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,520
but there is a lot of concepts here that we do have to somewhat take a decisive step with,

416
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,760
because from a personal perspective, although Tobuscus had a lot of highlights in his career,

417
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,800
he never really had any clear, defined legacy,

418
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,920
something that he's going to be associated with for the rest of time.

419
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,200
The closest he reaches to that, in my opinion, is the literal trailers,

420
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,560
and I think it was strong,

421
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:49,760
but I think that all of these crafts were undone by a very pivotal moment in his career.

422
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,160
So, on April the 8th, 2016,

423
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,040
April Fletcher, also known as YouTuber April F,

424
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:59,040
published a very in-depth post on Tumblr called The Truth About Tobuscus,

425
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,440
in which he makes a plethora of claims about Turner,

426
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,040
about the abuse she endured from him, both emotional and physical.

427
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,360
I'm going to leave a link to the post in the pinned comment,

428
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,880
it might be in a Google document, it's under references, as always,

429
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,960
just control F it, if you need to.

430
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,920
But either way, I'm not going to go into too many details,

431
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:20,160
other than the huge one of which the claim was made that he had actually drugged her,

432
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,160
and subsequently sexually assaulted her.

433
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,720
This was covered by Keem and by DeFranco, and at the time it was a pretty huge story.

434
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,800
There were multiple women who came forward with their testimonies about Turner as a person,

435
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,240
each of them differing slightly.

436
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,440
There was this general agreement that he clearly had his problems,

437
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,760
but the disagreement on Fletcher's testimony came in which many questioned their relationship,

438
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,640
including Turner's mother, and his ability to actually drug and subsequently assault someone,

439
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,440
and people who knew Turner did tend to say he had habits of being a bit unstable,

440
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,600
and Turner even admitted it himself.

441
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,520
Because I'm not perfect, and there are a lot of ways I could become a better person.

442
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,160
Have I been a bad boyfriend? Sometimes, yeah.

443
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,040
Did I party in my 20s? Yes, too much.

444
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,960
And so that's what I've been doing, is working on myself.

445
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,080
However, this does not mean the more serious claims are true.

446
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,520
It can often be that someone might rely on people's inductive assumptions

447
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,760
to then make a further claim about the person.

448
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,160
This is known as heuristics, and it's very possible that Fletcher knew Turner had a reputation,

449
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,480
and thus managed to create new allegations.

450
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,080
However, that's just a theory, and it does not mean that Fletcher is lying,

451
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,360
but I'm just saying it's not a valid argument to perhaps say

452
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,560
that he is capable of something much worse than he has admitted to.

453
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,600
At the end of the day, it's an innocent until proven guilty dynamic,

454
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,240
and you really have to use your instinct and say what you think in those situations.

455
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,040
I think given that Turner's actual personality seems to be one that is more spontaneous and impulsive,

456
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,560
and occasionally inappropriate, rather than outright calculated malice,

457
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,240
I can't really say that situation is probable, but I don't know him personally,

458
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,720
and therefore I do not have a steadfast opinion,

459
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,080
and those people who know him better still have a more insightful view.

460
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,240
With that said, I think the situation yielded a few unforeseen circumstances,

461
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,320
which at the end of the day doesn't mean that they shouldn't be discussed in the first place,

462
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,600
but equally, I feel, did occur regardless because of it.

463
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,600
Given the fact that Turner as a person was always somewhat distanced from his audience,

464
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:18,640
this was one of the first very personal things that the viewership en masse became acquainted with,

465
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:23,120
and I think that began to hang over him, and like many people when faced down with these claims,

466
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,240
Toby took a break from uploading, on his main channel in particular,

467
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,080
and he would provide occasional updates on his second channel on how he was doing,

468
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,600
notice how the second channel is considered to be the more personal one,

469
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,920
and on top of this, it was one of the situations that he covered that did receive views.

470
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,600
Keep this in mind, I feel this impacted his channel in the algorithm,

471
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,040
and maybe in people's perception too, even if it was subconscious.

472
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,640
Before he took a break, all at least cracked a few hundred thousand views,

473
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,880
and maybe even a million, or two million.

474
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,000
When he came back, he had real trouble capturing that momentum,

475
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,480
and even when he did, it did not tend to last.

476
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,520
Recently, he has tried to craft more commentary focused material,

477
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,480
but I think watching it, it outlines the problem that he always had,

478
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,200
as commentary really has to be built on some sort of personal trust between creator and viewer.

479
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,400
When I started researching this video, even though I knew the allegations

480
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,920
were a significant part of this,

481
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,200
I didn't think they would have affected his career on YouTube too much,

482
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,440
because at the end of the day, from what I've observed,

483
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,920
the original videos and the response videos,

484
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,360
there was a significant amount of skepticism that revolved around it,

485
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:27,200
particularly from the audience, and YouTube is a consumer-based market.

486
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,520
Like music, for example, a lot of CD individuals have made mega-bank,

487
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,680
even after allegations, and even convictions that would have ended their careers

488
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,280
in many other industries.

489
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,400
But I think the thing is, the allegations, whether true or not,

490
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,520
tend to be what many people think of when thinking of him,

491
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,680
despite his extensive creative backlog.

492
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,920
His most viewed video since the allegations,

493
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,440
is a video that came out two years after addressing the allegations,

494
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,880
where he also says this.

495
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,400
I almost gave up, but I didn't, and I won't.

496
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:03,200
So, give me my f***ing show back, and my book deal for young adults.

497
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,280
Stupid lying b****.

498
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,200
Which outlines another problem for him going forward as a creator.

499
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,040
As said, YouTube channels die.

500
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,720
There is no doubt about that, we all have our time to go into the light,

501
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,800
but we can normally move outside in less consumer-controlled industries.

502
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,040
However, with this situation, they'd likely cut him out

503
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,800
due to the reputational damages that he might have been associated with,

504
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,040
including a voice part in a Marvel series,

505
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,160
and it's undoubtedly going to affect him finding future work.

506
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,080
The video is a well-made video,

507
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,560
and he does all the right things that you would need to do

508
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,160
when addressing these allegations.

509
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,640
Once again, it's so hard to know who to believe,

510
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,200
even though due process will always prevail.

511
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,600
Equally, it raises the question of whether it was best

512
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,760
to publicise these claims like they were,

513
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,280
rather than just going to the police,

514
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,200
and that's another very difficult question.

515
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,040
I feel that we live in a world where the consequences of just an allegation

516
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,680
are so great that we might risk allowing people to abuse it,

517
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,320
but at the same time, when allegations are publicised,

518
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,840
it might enable people to come forward and provide corroborating accounts,

519
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,520
or even contradictory ones,

520
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,600
and the truth should always be the final goal.

521
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,600
Sexual assault is also an extremely hard crime to prosecute through the courts of law,

522
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,320
because it's often one person's word against another.

523
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,880
What we really need to do is work out how to make sure industries and individuals alike

524
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,640
don't behave in a reactionary way upon the surfacing of allegations,

525
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,440
while at the same time trying to change the communities

526
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,120
so that people feel more comfortable coming forward in the present tense.

527
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,560
It's an absolute minefield,

528
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,160
and you can see how unfortunately Turner was one who trod on the mine.

529
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,280
It's a sad end to what really is a prolific career

530
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,240
that few speak about with the fondness that you'd expect them to,

531
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,120
but you know what?

532
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,400
Maybe we shouldn't be sad.

533
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,080
He still made a lot of great content that no one else could really do like him,

534
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:52,080
and the quality of that content I am confident will transcend the restraints of time,

535
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,040
and for what it's worth,

536
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,680
although it's kinda hard to judge how he's doing in his videos,

537
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,240
judging by his Instagram, he seems fairly happy.

538
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,400
I do think his brand of literal trailers is something that isn't necessarily finished,

539
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,200
it's just with channels like Screen Junkies and Honest Trailers,

540
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,440
they've kept it going as such a central theme that it's what people keep coming back for.

541
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,800
I think a lot of Toby's work has dated, some of which worse than others,

542
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,120
but I still think there's a formula that might work here,

543
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,600
but if he doesn't want to, he shouldn't have to.

544
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,240
At the end of the day, you make the content that makes you happy,

545
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,160
that's what YouTube was originally about.

546
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,560
Whether that happiness is derived from the content itself,

547
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,800
or from something else the content might bring,

548
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,440
go and pursue it, don't let your dreams be dreams.

549
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,200
Toby Turner is a creative maestro, and there can be no doubt about that,

550
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,440
his rise to being one of the most popular YouTubers is rooted in some great ventures

551
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,640
that it really paid off,

552
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,680
and going in tandem with a gaming channel that subsequently succeeded

553
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,560
due to the fact that his personality fit into the sort of mold

554
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,160
that people were looking for at the time.

555
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,400
However, his content never fully gave people a character portrait they could hold onto,

556
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,800
and it was rooted in some superficiality,

557
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,520
which is likely why his supposed more personal channel didn't ever fully catch on,

558
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,400
maybe because Toby himself had a lot more personal problems

559
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,240
he didn't want to project onto the internet,

560
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,680
and I don't blame him for that.

561
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,640
However, when we did finally address that personality,

562
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,120
it was in rather unfortunate circumstances,

563
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,280
and I feel that this may have tainted his image,

564
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,400
whether people viewed the claims with credibility or not.

565
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,000
The algorithms gave him no love,

566
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,480
and the only videos that received significant interest

567
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,320
are ones that seem like he might be revealing something about a new situation,

568
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,960
or trying to recapture a foregone past,

569
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,880
and he'll even be aware of that.

570
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,800
But most importantly, I want to apologize,

571
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,320
because I said something in my video last week,

572
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,000
not the last one, that one,

573
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,080
I don't want to apologize for anything for, I like that one.

574
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,240
In a way, he knows what's defined him,

575
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,280
and I don't know with that knowledge where he'll go from here,

576
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,800
but I'm not sure he cares.

577
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,360
No, the great question that I want to leave is,

578
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,400
what will survive?

579
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,560
What will be left behind of Toby Turner?

580
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,360
I guess that's my parting question for you, the viewer,

581
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,560
what will be left behind?

582
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:58,400
This was a long, long, long, long video,

583
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,400
but I'd love to hear your thoughts, I really would.

584
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,600
I hope you guys have enjoyed it,

585
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,320
I worked tirelessly on researching the script,

586
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,640
and I hope it gives you something that you can take away.

587
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,520
I really want to give a shout out to the editors who've done a fantastic job,

588
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,600
you know, really wouldn't be anywhere without them,

589
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,800
so please go and check them out,

590
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,880
I'm going to leave their links in the pinned comment.

591
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,480
Also in the pinned comment,

592
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,000
you can find my Twitter, my Facebook, my Discord,

593
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,880
all that jazz,

594
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,600
make sure you can check me out there if you need to.

595
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,160
Also, big shout out to my Patreons,

596
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,640
very generous people, as seen here,

597
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,800
and one particular Patreon, Ryan,

598
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,040
who is just unbelievably generous,

599
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,840
I mean, it's kind of beautiful, it brings a tear to my eye.

600
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,280
I don't really have too much else to say,

601
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,200
I hope you guys are doing fantastically,

602
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,640
I do as well as I can.

603
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,920
Until the next one, however,

604
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,200
I'm The Right Opinion,

605
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,720
and I'll see you in the next one.
