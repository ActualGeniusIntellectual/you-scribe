00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The popular YouTube philanthropist, MrBeast, has found the image of being a motherless girl in the middle of the universe.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Boy is it a reach!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The youngsters like these brought up in a world of dyads and transgenders. There's nothing mysterious about them either.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And today we talk about some gentlemen, some articles, and a greater discussion that has been bouncing around in my mind for months,

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
which, given the events of recent, is finally deserving of my attention.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Here and there I've dropped the mention of media, often in less than a favourable tone,

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and it does seem abstract to me that something which, before I started paying attention to on the internet,

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I was never really particularly bothered by, now really frustrates me as a medium.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This is in part because I never really used it. My childhood experience with the PC constituted a FIFA manager,

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
RuneScape, Club Penguin, and a brief spell in a Call of Duty clan,

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:28,000
a venture that will forever bemuse me, though it did yield some pretty epic throwing knife montages.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I told you guys I was a man of many talents. But anyway, before I get lost in the forest that is my own ego,

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
we were discussing the media. When I started using online sites, it rapidly became clear to me how many sites had agendas to put.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I remember the 2015 UK general election, when the Daily Mail posted on their front page a tactical voting guide on how to keep labour out of number 10.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Despite the fact that, as a radio host, myself at the time, I was not allowed to express any political views pre-election.

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The media do have an extensive freedom, and damn do they milk that.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I realised it then, but I did just seem to leave it in the back of my head because I was fairly powerless at the time.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
No, not until the year of 2016 when I decided to pursue this damn YouTube dream did I start to assemble a list of qualms.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Certain media, some more than others, seem to focus on reactionary titles, poor reporting, and the farthest reaching within their legal realms,

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
aimed at masking fallacies with facts, ones that which, although not libelous, I always found pretty manipulative.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I think this has become even more apparent over the last few years, as certain figures have provoked that narrative into the open, bringing it into scrutiny.

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The person who has practically become the media nemesis is obviously American President Donald J Trump.

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't want to go into too much detail about him because the topic just ties me at this point,

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
but his election was not the most reassuring moment for the media, particularly as they were very hostile to him and his behaviour.

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I think that was a turning point when I realised that shit wasn't exactly working out the way I wanted it to.

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I wasn't particularly happy, but I did see it coming.

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So why am I here today? Well, many people disagree to the extent of the toxicity of modern journalism,

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
however one situation that brought creators near and far together was the situation surrounding MrBeast.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Now MrBeast is a creator who bases his channel in part around philanthropy, that is handing out the dollar to the less fortunate.

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
He often finds creative ways to do it, while balancing this with content based on ideas so absurdly intriguing they pool the views to fund his generosity,

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
although he does say that most of the money nowadays comes from the deals beyond the YouTube platform,

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
as the monetisation process has not been particularly merciful towards him.

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Either way, it's a reproductive process, and long may it last.

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The Atlantic must have seen his success and thought, how can we get a good spicy click out of that?

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And then thought, scandal.

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So reads the title.

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The popular YouTube philanthropist MrBeast has built his image on being a nice guy, but has a history of using homophobic slurs.

39
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What was his crime you may ask? What heinous atrocity did he commit against the gays?

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Well, let's just say it wasn't quite on the level of pogo, I guess, but nonetheless, MrBeast here called some people fags the bastard.

41
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Either way, I'm glad the journalists have finally worked out how to use the advanced search mechanism,

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
they should be able to dig out some tasty exposes even quicker.

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I think what made this article so identifiably bad is that it came out at a time where YouTubers haven't really been doing much wrong

44
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
against someone who is spreading legitimate positivity, and the criticism was so insignificant that presenting it in a way was dishonest.

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It shows the media will never really lay off the platform.

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Those are my first impressions, however for now I'll leave this information here,

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
what we'll be doing is I'll be discussing the various techniques employed by the media and how to identify them,

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and then returning to the article and applying it there so we can nail down the little specific things that annoy us a bit more than others.

49
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The purpose of this video will be to respond to some of the media's claims, reveal the sketchy tactics,

50
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and hopefully raise some level of awareness, while also being able to distinguish good journalism from bad journalism.

51
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm sure there are some people who will point out this video may give the media some form of attention,

52
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
and although that is true, if I can convince a long term mindset when approaching this topic,

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
then I consider that to be greater than any short term traffic that may be given from this video.

54
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's also important to remember that primarily these videos are for your entertainment,

55
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I know I can't give that to everyone, but if enough people take something away then I'll classify that as a win

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
even if they get some additional attention from it.

57
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
With that out of the way, I think it's time we get to discussing how the media has worn down many within the YouTube scene with their articles.

58
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Let us proceed.

59
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
In spite of our differences, as a premise, I still love YouTube.

60
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Execution aside, there are some truly excellent features that do make it a defining platform of our generation.

61
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You notice how I said, our generation, well, I always find that simple fact to be the Achilles heel, or one of the many Achilles heels,

62
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
but you know what I mean nonetheless.

63
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Many people outside the YouTube demographic are never completely immersed in the intricacies, and that's alright,

64
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
they probably have lives, but the media recognise this and they're certainly not ignorant to how YouTube works,

65
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and so they abuse it, because it makes spicy drama.

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
This was illustrated in the demonetisation scandal last year, which in my opinion,

67
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
really galvanised a turbulent relationship between YouTubers and the more mainstream media on two levels,

68
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
which I'll clarify after this next story.

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Now make no mistake, what happened with regards to demonetisation was completely inevitable,

70
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
it was a wrong that needed to be corrected, it's just a shame that corporations became so paranoid about it.

71
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
In spite of the fact that there was always a situation, the reactionary press sensationalised it to be something greater,

72
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
scared off multiple advertisers who came back very dubiously and threatened a platform that we know and love.

73
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I don't think anyone felt it was unjust that it had been reported on,

74
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
there were plenty of content creators who were publicly calling out the platform on how they monetised certain content,

75
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
but it was how it was presented, and their motives for presenting it.

76
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
These advertisements being put on content shouldn't have meant anything catastrophic to the companies behind them,

77
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
after all they don't select the ads, they just select the general company to promote on,

78
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
but many of the businesses were afraid that people would wrongly create such an association and thus avoid the brand.

79
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Although this was most notoriously associated with the Wall Street Journal, this was originally reported on by the Times on February 7th 2017.

80
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But why does everyone seem to have such a hate boner for the Wall Street Journal in particular,

81
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
out of all the various publications it seems a strangely specific grudge.

82
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Well this is where we discuss how a situation can be manipulated.

83
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The Wall Street Journal introduced themselves not with the story above but approximately a week later with a report on PewDiePie over the controversial Fiverr gig.

84
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This is the first one that slightly vexed people, they essentially posted a story and took credit for a sacking from Maker Studios.

85
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Now as far as Maker Studios goes, they're a private company and they can do what they want,

86
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I can see why they might not want to support that sort of content,

87
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
but I also think there is a perfectly justified anger at what the Wall Street Journal did,

88
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
they essentially called in to your employer to get you sacked,

89
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
not because anyone writing the actual report was hurt or upset by the video in question,

90
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
but because it would make a spicy story,

91
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
If any of them actually cared, they wouldn't have waited a month before the topic of YouTube was galvanised by the times before putting in a call,

92
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
it seemed opportunistic and rather expedient.

93
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
People don't like that, regardless of what they may think of a distasteful joke.

94
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
In the article they also claim that PewDiePie had made 9 videos with quote anti-semitic jokes or Nazi imagery,

95
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
a claim that was lambasted by basically everyone.

96
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Let's just say they're operating some intense ratios on their YouTube channel.

97
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But you do remember there being a Wall Street Journal article written on the topic of YouTube demonetisation right?

98
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
After all, that was what the whole H3 debacle was about, I'll refresh everyone's memory.

99
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You see, on March 21st, over a month after the original problems were surfaced by the times,

100
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Google's Chief Business Officer, Philip Schindler, addressed many of the concerns on a blog post that explained the changes that they would be making.

101
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Now for anyone with decent YouTube experience, they understood what this meant,

102
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
not everything will be immediately sorted, but with the patience of those around them, this will be resolved.

103
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This is where the journal irritated people the most, because what they did is they waited a few days

104
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and then dropped the story that said, oh my god, we can't believe this is still happening.

105
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Unfortunately, this was going to be overshadowed by H3's rather terrible blunder.

106
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
However, that does not make the article any better, nor any less of another opportunistic graph.

107
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It would not surprise you that one of the people who wrote the first article also wrote the second one.

108
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It felt cheap, everyone anticipated that nothing would be solved immediately.

109
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm sure the Wall Street Journal did too, but this sort of fear mongering seemed highly dishonest.

110
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
There was a very small minority of content that the Wall Street Journal had picked out with a fine-to-comb and overstated their influence.

111
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,000
With many of the safeguards YouTube have in place, the examples were just a case that could be found on many domain sites that anyone had free access to express themselves on.

112
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Even on the Times article, they note one other example that wasn't just YouTube related.

113
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It seems specific targeting for a general problem that could never be completely prevented,

114
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and that is why they still write articles about it to this day, even with the amount of safeguards in.

115
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Now in hindsight, I'm obviously glad the current site setup is more secure than it was before.

116
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
There was clearly content that I'm glad isn't being monetized.

117
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It was just a shame that 99% of creators were caught in the crossfire, and the Journal did not seem particularly concerned about that.

118
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And listen, they can do what they want, free press, fantastic, but people are still going to judge them for it,

119
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and many feel they exploited the situation in true media fashion.

120
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
People also felt like they were doing it because they were waning in popularity,

121
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
and YouTube serving itself as heavy competition, particularly due to the move towards more opinionated commentators and a gradual distrust of the media,

122
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
it seemed to add up for many creators, and given the effects of the Wall Street Journal's reports, people felt a disdain towards them.

123
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It didn't help that YouTube were absolute pushovers, but people were already convinced of that before the scandal, so this was not news to them.

124
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
With that said, despite their icon status, I actually think the Wall Street Journal were not necessarily the worst defenders in every field.

125
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What they did I felt was in complete contempt, with plenty of manipulative tactics that I will be addressing later.

126
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But really, I think the worst thing about the Wall Street Journal that makes it stand out was that it was mildly effective.

127
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And although certain media since then hasn't been without any impact, most of it has just deflected off, and therefore been forgettable.

128
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But it doesn't excuse some of the atrocious hot takes that currently exist on this wretched planet.

129
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And since the main Wall Street Journal scandal, plenty of media have tried to cash in on the popularity of YouTube-related articles, and I've decided to split them into two categories.

130
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The old media, and the woke media.

131
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And I do this because I think the Wall Street Journal saga brought an interest from both sides.

132
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
There had been plenty of casual pieces in the past, but this was the controversy that brought the eyes onto YouTube,

133
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
and has kept people invested even when there appears to be nothing worthy of reporting.

134
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The Wall Street Journal definitely bridged these two genres.

135
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The important point to remember is that plenty of articles mix these two, but these are the two most prominent approaches that I've recognised.

136
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm going to start with the old media because I don't really think the way I order these will make much difference,

137
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and it does lead me to a point that I'd never really considered until thinking about this topic.

138
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Being a YouTuber to many is considered an occupation, and when thinking about it, that as a classification is rather reductionist.

139
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I think the old media play this to the advantage on a fairly regular basis, the idea that people are just YouTubers.

140
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Which although not necessarily untrue, is not really representing the variety of creators on the platform.

141
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Although I do think that those said creators do share part of the responsibility on the branding parts,

142
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
a lot of us do like to flaunt the label.

143
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What this does though is create an image of a collective.

144
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This is especially effective when the audience you're talking to isn't necessarily familiar with the website.

145
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I think this is an important thing to note.

146
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
When some twatty musician or actor is taken down for behaving in a shitty manner,

147
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
people blame it on the individual, not on the industry.

148
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
When a YouTuber does it, the accountability becomes a lot murkier.

149
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What do I mean?

150
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Things like this makes me think social internet programs should be shut down.

151
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It is so sad how so many people abuse the internet.

152
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Sometimes I wonder if the best thing would be to just shut the internet down.

153
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
They are blocked in China, and many other countries are doing the same to protect their young generation.

154
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
They do not meet the rules of respect.

155
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The world has gone to pots, these sorts of things should be banned and the sites taken down.

156
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So glad my kids are grown up and want to encounter these sorts of people.

157
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Can't we just get rid of YouTube already?

158
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Quit giving these self-absorbed imbeciles a platform for their cruelty disguised as entertainment.

159
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And of course, YouTube cooperated in this repellent, evil crime.

160
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I hope this person gets his head kicked off in prison.

161
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
YouTube exists and thrives because of live-action trolls like this.

162
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Hefty civil judgements against the ZZ Hakane creators may be the best way to help them grow up quickly.

163
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Anyone who acts badly online should also have it recorded on their police record.

164
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You and Greg Paul both love.

165
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
That last one isn't really relevant to the point I was making, I just found it very funny.

166
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It is important to note that this does not necessarily represent everyone's thoughts,

167
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
and that there were many posts just bashing the individuals.

168
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But given the overwhelming support for these comments, it did seem important to include them as examples.

169
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
These examples are not arguments against the publication because it's often an individual's responsibility of how they think,

170
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and the information presented wasn't necessarily misleading.

171
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But I personally believe that many of the beliefs held here are so baseless that they could only be the result of one-sided information.

172
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
There were many more hot takes on this, millennials, the left, all that jazz.

173
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
But these were the most YouTube-related takes.

174
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And it's amazing how YouTube and the internet has established itself as its own domain,

175
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
despite the fact that a lot of people act as individuals on it.

176
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So to have the media create that label is kinda unique.

177
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I think in part it's due to the cultural monopoly and establishment that YouTube has.

178
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
There is no site quite like YouTube.

179
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Much like some people were considered viners, the website was part of the draw.

180
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It was its own genre, rather than it just being a subset of the genre.

181
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You wouldn't call the authors of the articles above daily mailers,

182
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
because they're just columnists, many of whom would be interchangeable on other competing websites.

183
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The form of entertainment that YouTube promotes is so unique that it has been given that label,

184
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
despite the fact that there are many different types of entertainers on YouTube.

185
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The label itself underplays it and often leads to these distorted perceptions that we witness in the media,

186
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
causing people to assume that YouTube is just some hub for millennial pillocks jerking each other off

187
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
while filling Oreos with toothpaste and feeding it to homeless people.

188
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
A statement only partly true.

189
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I jest, once again.

190
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But my point still stands.

191
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I've noticed a huge increase in volume of these types of stories on sites like the Daily Mail,

192
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
who didn't used to cover this,

193
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
but now they're borderline acting as any trending topic channel just for an outsider's point of view.

194
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And I am 100% serious about that statement.

195
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
However, the audience naivety allows them to appear more unbiased or being very selective with the information they present,

196
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
and therefore leading to a more inductive message about the greater state of YouTube,

197
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
causing people to not see it in perspective.

198
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
YouTube is still new to many people, and first impressions mean a lot.

199
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Just try not to get your first impressions through sites like the Daily Mail and you'll be alright.

200
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
So while more traditionalist sites like the Daily Mail appeal to the less well-versed individuals

201
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
on what social media is really like, what do you have on the other side?

202
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Well, you have people who clearly know more about the YouTube system,

203
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
but are just inductive in so many different and irritating ways.

204
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Whereas our former example makes general statements about the platform,

205
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
the woke media prefer to go after specific people with a personal grudge like no other.

206
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It'll often stem from the sort of very high detail probing journalism that I'm going to be looking into very soon,

207
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
with numerous lines of reasoning which I find a tad tentative.

208
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Their technique isn't exclusive to YouTube, in fact I've noticed it a nauseating amount of times at this point,

209
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
but for some reason they do have specific distates for YouTube.

210
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
My general hunch is that it's because YouTube politically does have individuals who are less PC,

211
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
and those who are not big on the journalistic agenda.

212
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Like the gaming industry which I explained in my Bully Hunters video,

213
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
it's a bit more blasé, and does have some fairly outspoken figures on some gaming-related incidents.

214
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What I find the woke media to do is to take up the cause of something moral,

215
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
and then make a ridiculous argument relating back to it,

216
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
followed by a justification that bases itself in a logical fallacy,

217
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
and then a conclusion that a person is doing something much worse than they actually are,

218
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
while using the moral cause to fall back onto an at least existent amount of support.

219
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I thought we'd do a practical with this, as it happens on a fairly regular basis.

220
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
One of the examples that epitomises this to a recent extent was a situation with PewDiePie,

221
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
in which Motherboard, the Vice-owned domain, took his video he made on Alinity,

222
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
and well, the title clearly shows we're going to be in for a rollercoaster ride.

223
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Now what follows is a line of dishonest arguments that make mild comments seem like borderline hate speech,

224
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
so let's use my little classification just to identify the little ticks they've used here.

225
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
What's the moral cause? Women's rights. I like women's rights.

226
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Sounds good to me, lads. What's the ridiculous argument?

227
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I mean, there are multiple ones, but for the sake of not prolonging this anymore,

228
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
let's just say that PewDiePie is, quote,

229
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
telling his audience that millions of men are not responsible for their actions,

230
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
and that when women dress a certain way, they are asking for it.

231
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What is the baseless justification?

232
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Well, in this instance, it appears to be a slippery slope,

233
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
that somehow PewDiePie pointing out that Alinity was behaving sexually,

234
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
and not just a bra strap showing like this article implies,

235
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
is somehow leading to people believing that women are asking for it when they wear revealing clothing.

236
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The author references comments that really don't prove anything other than the fact that they agree with PewDiePie,

237
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
and even then, if they had been more vulgar, what would they have proven?

238
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Not much from my point of view, because most of PewDiePie's content was his opinion,

239
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
and being persuaded by opinions is different to being persuaded by per se one-sided facts,

240
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
as I noted earlier with my Daily Mail point.

241
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Opinions are by nature biased, and therefore unless the factual premises that you base your opinions in are misleading,

242
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
then you can't really be prosecuted for other people judging the situation in your favour,

243
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
whether it's done in an eloquent manner or not.

244
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You haven't proven that what PewDiePie said was overly one-sided or misleading,

245
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
so you don't have the privilege to use fan responses as arguments.

246
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
The only comment you claim to be taking out context isn't provided with the context, so I can't really comment on it,

247
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
but even then, it's a very, very small reason of why people might dislike her,

248
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
and doesn't relate to any of the comments you cite.

249
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And, before we get pulled away from what we're actually discussing,

250
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
what is the idea that the individual in question has done something much worse than what has actually happened?

251
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Well, I mean the author's slippery slope has already done that,

252
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
but basically the author implies that PewDiePie is responsible for various abuse Alinity has received,

253
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
and that he is part of the problem that causes streamers like her to be sexualised.

254
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
This argument itself has been covered multiple times in depth, and I'll leave that up to you.

255
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But personally, I do recommend watching the video banning PewDiePie,

256
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:25,000
and although I was intrigued by the article at first, watching the video gave it a lot of context that made me realise that this was some real grasping at straws.

257
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So, now we've distinguished between the two, the old media rely on stating facts in a plain way,

258
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
that although not necessarily false, can create a one-sided image that lead people to fill in the gaps with their own ideas of what YouTube is.

259
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
On the other hand, the woke media tries to fill in the gaps themselves,

260
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
but with ideas that appear so absurd to me, they really just seem like personal smear campaigns.

261
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So I thought I'd devote this next part to explaining various tactics that I've identified within the media,

262
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
spot the little tricks, and then go and apply it to a little article that we mentioned earlier.

263
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Coming fresh out of the PewDiePie article, you probably remember that I used the phrase, slippery slope.

264
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
A slippery slope is an argument that basically one thing could have a greater collateral effect, and thus lead to something worse.

265
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
An example of this would be those who say that gay marriage will lead to the inevitable destruction of the western society.

266
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The slippery slope is one of the favourite tactics used by a lot of these publications,

267
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
because by doing it they can make something out to be much more impactful than it initially would appear to be.

268
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Much alike to the people who use your political position to say how it could actually lead to Marxism or Nazism,

269
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
even if you're not one of them yourself.

270
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
The real issue is that a slippery slope can sometimes exist,

271
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
it's just such a subjective concept that anyone can use it to their advantage to create enemies out of the most moderate people.

272
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I'd urge you to always check the source material in these instances,

273
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
as context really shows whether it can be taken as or lead to something worse than it actually is.

274
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
For my next part, I chose the recent Elon Musk debacle,

275
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
in which he decided to take on the media in a series of tweets that went at them for their alleged dishonesty.

276
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Now I must stress that Elon Musk is not a YouTuber,

277
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
but as I said earlier, journalistic tactics like these are not exclusive to YouTube,

278
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
they're a general thing which I think is important to apply.

279
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Musk's idea of Pravda, which is rating the media on their trustworthiness a separate site, is intriguing,

280
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
although it would need much more elaboration before any judgement could be passed on it.

281
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
However, the media were not happy, and they took up certain narratives that were fairly transparent,

282
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
in fact it was so transparent that it basically became a meme.

283
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Now Elon Musk, regardless of whether his motivations were self-driven, which they probably were,

284
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
said what a lot of people were thinking, his statement on how the media were lacking trust is fairly reasonable,

285
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
yet many journalists decided to compare him to Trump, I wonder why.

286
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Basically Donald Trump, as I said earlier, is another passionate critic of the media,

287
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
he's also rich, like Elon Musk, and he's also not the most popular gent with many people.

288
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Yet Musk and Trump's attitudes are completely different on many behalfs,

289
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
in fact, in what must be one of the worst attempts to dunk on Musk,

290
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The Guardian made a quiz of who said it, Donald Trump or Elon Musk,

291
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
and I got full marks, not because I'm a superfan of either,

292
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
but because they're really quite easy to distinguish on many halves.

293
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Anyway, besides the fact that Donald Trump and Elon Musk generally don't have that much in common,

294
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
their arguments on this topic were similar, heaven forbid, you share an opinion on something.

295
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
The media do this mainly to get the surface level impressions,

296
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
people see a title like, what Elon Musk and Donald Trump don't get about journalism,

297
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
and it sounds like they're pals, even though it's not necessarily wrong, it's manipulative.

298
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
This article, which was randomly chosen by the way from a plethora of Musk-Trump articles,

299
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
continuously references them as if for some reason Trump is a necessary inclusion.

300
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
We already know Trump's criticisms of the media as if he hasn't fucking tweeted about them enough,

301
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
he has not presented anything new in the last few weeks as far as I'm concerned.

302
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Also compare and contrast the descriptions of the characters within this article,

303
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
on one hand you have the thin-skinned Tesla founder and CEO,

304
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
and the investigative news non-profit reveal, and they were merely reporting on safety issues,

305
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
and in response Elon Musk emulates the president.

306
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
This is the sort of journalism that ticks people off, because it over-represents one side and under-represents the other,

307
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
we see it all the time, these are the small things that grate on people,

308
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
but some don't understand why it grates, well it's because these words, although not intrinsically false,

309
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
seem cherry-picked to make one side seem good and one side seem bad.

310
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
For example, I could describe H3 Productions as a comedian activist who invested hundreds of thousands of pounds

311
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
to uphold fair use on YouTube, or I could describe them as the alleged transphobe

312
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
who falsely claimed the Wall Street Journal were faking their articles.

313
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Both of these descriptions are true, but they're not really representative of him,

314
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
in fact they're more representative of your own position,

315
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
and that's what people don't like about these articles, they give away their bias in the most subtle way.

316
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Using words like meltdown to describe Elon Musk's response, saying that he was under pressure,

317
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
dealing with very subjective, definitive concepts that don't exactly reflect the situation,

318
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
will make the public reject them, and recognise it as dishonest.

319
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
A simple YouTube example of this would be when the media covering the PewDiePie case

320
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
classed his anti-semitic jokes as posts.

321
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Once again, although not false, it leaves gaps to be filled by outsiders.

322
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
There was another story where Musk retweeted an article from a site with a rather sketchy reputation,

323
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
many journalists jumped on this in an attempt to dunk on him, but the public reception was lukewarm at best,

324
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
it was a weak guilt by association argument that even if true didn't necessarily change the validity of his points,

325
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
and when he did find out the website lacked reputation, he removed his endorsement.

326
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Most people do not look into the websites that they retweet, but more what they say.

327
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Should Musk have done that? Sure.

328
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But did that change the points he was making exactly? Not really, no.

329
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Even when you get to the opinion, they're ridiculously weak,

330
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
one claiming that these journalistic websites couldn't be in the pocket of any fossil fuel gas company

331
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
because they'd written articles on some fossil fuel or gas companies.

332
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Now, despite the obvious fact that any media site could be in the pocket of one, whilst smearing the competitors,

333
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
the links that the author references have the most recent article on such a topic two years ago,

334
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
which was about the border patrol union, as if they'd be paying companies off,

335
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
as if Elon Musk would be referencing them, and a majority of other articles that were around ten years old,

336
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
which genuinely proves jack shit considering they've written three articles about Tesla in the last sixty days.

337
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Now I've gone off on a tangent, but please, just argue better. There is a greater point here.

338
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Certain journalists bank on appearing confident in their references as a majority of consumers will not check them,

339
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
and just assume that because they're cited, they must be alright.

340
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Having a link does not add credibility immediately.

341
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Check that shit, it might actually have the additional context you need to prove the opposite.

342
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
The other thing is the titles, and this has been ran into the ground of recent.

343
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
With the increasing volume of media, titles have become increasingly more clickbaity to bring in that traffic.

344
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So what? Most YouTubers use clickbaits to some extent too, which is relatively true.

345
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
The issue is that it's a different type of clickbait.

346
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
The media have really capitalised on what I call factbaiting,

347
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
which is this notion of stating something which is enough for people to respond to without even having to check out the actual article,

348
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
and although this statement may not be false, it's manipulative or misrepresentative.

349
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And this is where we come back to MrBeast.

350
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I think it's necessary to involve Twitter at this point, because Twitter has cultivated something very unique, which is retweet culture.

351
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Basically, an article is posted, and without necessarily reading or checking it, some people either retweet it or quote tweet it.

352
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Quote tweeting is the real interesting case, because people basically wait these provocative titles,

353
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
quote them out, and dunk on whoever they don't like through it.

354
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
It's an absolutely fascinating dynamic, but it's not particularly good for journalistic integrity.

355
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
It basically encourages the spicy takes, because if someone can get that mad dunk, then they'll hit 50k retweets,

356
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
and they'll be able to promote their soundcloud.

357
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
With the side effect leading to traffic for the article, some people will be bound to do it.

358
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Twitter has two important factors. One, an interest in social media, and two, a rather left-wing audience.

359
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
What does that mean exactly? Well, it means that the hot takes are tailored to that demographic often.

360
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Let's have a look at the MrBeast title, then.

361
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
That is definitely asking for it, but it didn't work. Not this time, at least. Why is that?

362
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Well, you know how I said the Wall Street Journal struck the sweet spot between old media and woke media?

363
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
That sweet spot is not always there, and in this one, it's quite clear that they've missed the mark terribly.

364
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
In spite of his significant subscriber base, he's still too niche for most people who read old media to be interested in,

365
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
and he's too insubstantial to certain woke agendas to be worth their time either.

366
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
With a fanbase that is fairly apolitical, claims of homophobia do not concern them,

367
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
especially with the evidence lacking, and therefore, all you do is attract people who do have an interest in him,

368
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
which for a large majority are people who will be defending him.

369
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
When you read the article, the fact baiting made in the title becomes ever clearer.

370
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
The claims of a history of homophobic comments amount to him using the word fag twice,

371
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
and also saying Windows is gay while mocking his own sexuality.

372
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Let's see what other techniques that we were discussing earlier we can notice here.

373
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Habit of calling people thanks. Apparently, a habit is something that you do twice now in observable history. Barely true.

374
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Jimmy showed no regret or remorse, and this is the sort of statement loaded with the fact of something he didn't do.

375
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Let me state something else. Jimmy showed no pride or joy, both of which are true statements but send completely different messages.

376
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
The only reason that you'd have to use such a statement is if Mr. Beast should be expected to show regret or remorse,

377
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
and frankly, I do not think he should.

378
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Before they were made aware of the comments, two YouTubers told me they considered Jimmy to be kind, humble, and earnest.

379
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I don't really need to respond to this comment, it's just so bloody stupid.

380
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
But if you think that comments like those change a person's character, then I do not know what planet you're living on.

381
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
But homophobia runs deep in the YouTube community.

382
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
If you saw the reaction to Pogo, it's not a question of homophobia on the entertainment side of YouTube,

383
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
it's a question of what people view as homophobia.

384
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Personally, I do not think this is homophobia, and to imply such, I find a real watering down of what we view it as.

385
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
There are so many statements that people on YouTube just don't seem sensitive to in the same way that many of the media are,

386
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
and that creates a real disconnect.

387
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
The author Taylor Enns says he regularly uses homosexuality as a punchline,

388
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
despite the fact that the examples she lists are over the span of three years.

389
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Given the volume of your examples, how can you consider that regular?

390
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It is a rotten piece, not because anything in it is an explicit lie,

391
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
but because it walks so close to the line of lying in an attempt to tell something mildly interesting.

392
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
If we're reaching the point where such methods are being chosen over presenting facts in an honest and just way,

393
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
in favour of just really lazy journalism piggybacking on moral causes,

394
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
which it really has no actual vested interest in, must I remind you, that I'm not on board.

395
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
It's taken something positive and said, how do we attack this character?

396
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Let me tell you this, this article said much more about your character than his.

397
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And that's the thing, when I made my Great Pool video,

398
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I assembled so many various ideas on how something can state a greater narrative about his character from the way he behaves.

399
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
You literally just search MrBeast using the word fag.

400
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
What does that say about him? If anything at all, it is just sad, miserable reporting.

401
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
The problem is, the industry has developed this whole technique of loopholes to not exactly lie,

402
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
but convey information in a manipulative fashion.

403
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I don't think there's any way to regulate it, and I don't think you should, but more attention should be brought to it.

404
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
So people's mentality in a way evolves as to not gratify the bad journalists in these endeavours.

405
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
YouTube has appeared to be a particular target of the media,

406
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
mainly because it finds itself too modern for many publications and their audiences, and too edgy for others.

407
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
This does not mean that every article printed on a YouTuber will be badly written,

408
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
nor does it mean that YouTubers will not be deserving of public criticism from time to time.

409
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Let me make that clear. People should be open to criticism.

410
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,000
But when the BBC are claiming that YouTube could be encouraging kids to eat calories because they posed with unhealthy food,

411
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
people become pissed off.

412
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And really, I find what I've said today more helpful in distinguishing the good from the bad.

413
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,000
If you're reading an article, just see how it presents its arguments, how it uses that language, and how its references check out.

414
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
It may not just be pivotal in defining your opinion on that situation, but on the credibility of what you're reading.

415
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Because at the end of the day, the news should not define your opinion, it should provide the foundations for you to craft your own opinion.

416
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
But if you do see a good, honest article, go give it some love, encourage it, see who the author is, send them some love.

417
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Because that's what we need more of.

418
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
For the media, for you, people have lost their faith, and judging from some articles, it's quite clear why.

419
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
If you want to win them back, it's gonna be a slow process, and the way you respond to criticism has not been working well either.

420
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
However, that's a topic that I might just save for another time.

421
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I think you've suffered enough.

422
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I hope you can improve, because the media does play a necessary role in modern life, and people would love to be able to trust you.

423
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
It's not like people enjoy being skeptical, it's just the position that you've put us in.

424
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Anyhow, this video turned out slightly longer than I intended it to be, but I found I had a lot to say.

425
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
There were things that I planned to talk about that I didn't even manage to do that, so I guess I'll be saving that for another time.

426
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
There's always more to discuss.

427
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
What are your thoughts? I'd love to hear. I tend to respond to a lot of comments in the first few hours, and then I'll let them simmer.

428
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
However, you can still reach me on Twitter, at TheRightOpinion, I have open DMs, and on Facebook, I'll leave the links down below.

429
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I'll also be in my Discord sometimes, basically everything under the sun.

430
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Also, make sure you check out and subscribe to the editors if you have the time.

431
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
They do a stand-up job in making this content come together, and it would not be the same without them, so please go and send them some love.

432
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
With regards to the love, thank you for all the support.

433
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It has been great at recent, and honestly, it means the world to me.

434
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Please guys, do take care of yourselves.

435
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Until then however, I'm TheRightOpinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
