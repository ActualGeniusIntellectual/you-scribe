0	7000	The popular YouTube philanthropist, MrBeast, has found the image of being a motherless girl in the middle of the universe.
7000	8000	Boy is it a reach!
8000	23000	The youngsters like these brought up in a world of dyads and transgenders. There's nothing mysterious about them either.
23000	43000	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
43000	49000	And today we talk about some gentlemen, some articles, and a greater discussion that has been bouncing around in my mind for months,
49000	52000	which, given the events of recent, is finally deserving of my attention.
52000	56000	Here and there I've dropped the mention of media, often in less than a favourable tone,
56000	60000	and it does seem abstract to me that something which, before I started paying attention to on the internet,
60000	64000	I was never really particularly bothered by, now really frustrates me as a medium.
64000	69000	This is in part because I never really used it. My childhood experience with the PC constituted a FIFA manager,
69000	72000	RuneScape, Club Penguin, and a brief spell in a Call of Duty clan,
72000	88000	a venture that will forever bemuse me, though it did yield some pretty epic throwing knife montages.
88000	93000	I told you guys I was a man of many talents. But anyway, before I get lost in the forest that is my own ego,
93000	100000	we were discussing the media. When I started using online sites, it rapidly became clear to me how many sites had agendas to put.
100000	108000	I remember the 2015 UK general election, when the Daily Mail posted on their front page a tactical voting guide on how to keep labour out of number 10.
108000	115000	Despite the fact that, as a radio host, myself at the time, I was not allowed to express any political views pre-election.
115000	118000	The media do have an extensive freedom, and damn do they milk that.
118000	124000	I realised it then, but I did just seem to leave it in the back of my head because I was fairly powerless at the time.
124000	131000	No, not until the year of 2016 when I decided to pursue this damn YouTube dream did I start to assemble a list of qualms.
131000	138000	Certain media, some more than others, seem to focus on reactionary titles, poor reporting, and the farthest reaching within their legal realms,
138000	145000	aimed at masking fallacies with facts, ones that which, although not libelous, I always found pretty manipulative.
145000	153000	I think this has become even more apparent over the last few years, as certain figures have provoked that narrative into the open, bringing it into scrutiny.
153000	158000	The person who has practically become the media nemesis is obviously American President Donald J Trump.
158000	162000	I don't want to go into too much detail about him because the topic just ties me at this point,
162000	168000	but his election was not the most reassuring moment for the media, particularly as they were very hostile to him and his behaviour.
168000	173000	I think that was a turning point when I realised that shit wasn't exactly working out the way I wanted it to.
173000	176000	I wasn't particularly happy, but I did see it coming.
176000	182000	So why am I here today? Well, many people disagree to the extent of the toxicity of modern journalism,
182000	187000	however one situation that brought creators near and far together was the situation surrounding MrBeast.
187000	193000	Now MrBeast is a creator who bases his channel in part around philanthropy, that is handing out the dollar to the less fortunate.
193000	200000	He often finds creative ways to do it, while balancing this with content based on ideas so absurdly intriguing they pool the views to fund his generosity,
200000	205000	although he does say that most of the money nowadays comes from the deals beyond the YouTube platform,
205000	209000	as the monetisation process has not been particularly merciful towards him.
209000	212000	Either way, it's a reproductive process, and long may it last.
212000	218000	The Atlantic must have seen his success and thought, how can we get a good spicy click out of that?
218000	221000	And then thought, scandal.
221000	223000	So reads the title.
223000	234000	The popular YouTube philanthropist MrBeast has built his image on being a nice guy, but has a history of using homophobic slurs.
234000	239000	What was his crime you may ask? What heinous atrocity did he commit against the gays?
239000	246000	Well, let's just say it wasn't quite on the level of pogo, I guess, but nonetheless, MrBeast here called some people fags the bastard.
246000	250000	Either way, I'm glad the journalists have finally worked out how to use the advanced search mechanism,
250000	254000	they should be able to dig out some tasty exposes even quicker.
254000	260000	I think what made this article so identifiably bad is that it came out at a time where YouTubers haven't really been doing much wrong
260000	266000	against someone who is spreading legitimate positivity, and the criticism was so insignificant that presenting it in a way was dishonest.
266000	269000	It shows the media will never really lay off the platform.
269000	273000	Those are my first impressions, however for now I'll leave this information here,
273000	278000	what we'll be doing is I'll be discussing the various techniques employed by the media and how to identify them,
278000	284000	and then returning to the article and applying it there so we can nail down the little specific things that annoy us a bit more than others.
284000	288000	The purpose of this video will be to respond to some of the media's claims, reveal the sketchy tactics,
288000	294000	and hopefully raise some level of awareness, while also being able to distinguish good journalism from bad journalism.
294000	298000	I'm sure there are some people who will point out this video may give the media some form of attention,
298000	303000	and although that is true, if I can convince a long term mindset when approaching this topic,
303000	307000	then I consider that to be greater than any short term traffic that may be given from this video.
307000	311000	It's also important to remember that primarily these videos are for your entertainment,
311000	316000	I know I can't give that to everyone, but if enough people take something away then I'll classify that as a win
316000	318000	even if they get some additional attention from it.
318000	325000	With that out of the way, I think it's time we get to discussing how the media has worn down many within the YouTube scene with their articles.
325000	326000	Let us proceed.
334000	338000	In spite of our differences, as a premise, I still love YouTube.
338000	344000	Execution aside, there are some truly excellent features that do make it a defining platform of our generation.
344000	350000	You notice how I said, our generation, well, I always find that simple fact to be the Achilles heel, or one of the many Achilles heels,
350000	352000	but you know what I mean nonetheless.
352000	357000	Many people outside the YouTube demographic are never completely immersed in the intricacies, and that's alright,
357000	362000	they probably have lives, but the media recognise this and they're certainly not ignorant to how YouTube works,
362000	365000	and so they abuse it, because it makes spicy drama.
365000	369000	This was illustrated in the demonetisation scandal last year, which in my opinion,
369000	375000	really galvanised a turbulent relationship between YouTubers and the more mainstream media on two levels,
375000	377000	which I'll clarify after this next story.
377000	381000	Now make no mistake, what happened with regards to demonetisation was completely inevitable,
381000	386000	it was a wrong that needed to be corrected, it's just a shame that corporations became so paranoid about it.
386000	392000	In spite of the fact that there was always a situation, the reactionary press sensationalised it to be something greater,
392000	397000	scared off multiple advertisers who came back very dubiously and threatened a platform that we know and love.
397000	401000	I don't think anyone felt it was unjust that it had been reported on,
401000	406000	there were plenty of content creators who were publicly calling out the platform on how they monetised certain content,
406000	409000	but it was how it was presented, and their motives for presenting it.
409000	414000	These advertisements being put on content shouldn't have meant anything catastrophic to the companies behind them,
414000	418000	after all they don't select the ads, they just select the general company to promote on,
418000	424000	but many of the businesses were afraid that people would wrongly create such an association and thus avoid the brand.
424000	432000	Although this was most notoriously associated with the Wall Street Journal, this was originally reported on by the Times on February 7th 2017.
432000	436000	But why does everyone seem to have such a hate boner for the Wall Street Journal in particular,
436000	440000	out of all the various publications it seems a strangely specific grudge.
440000	443000	Well this is where we discuss how a situation can be manipulated.
443000	451000	The Wall Street Journal introduced themselves not with the story above but approximately a week later with a report on PewDiePie over the controversial Fiverr gig.
451000	457000	This is the first one that slightly vexed people, they essentially posted a story and took credit for a sacking from Maker Studios.
457000	462000	Now as far as Maker Studios goes, they're a private company and they can do what they want,
462000	465000	I can see why they might not want to support that sort of content,
465000	469000	but I also think there is a perfectly justified anger at what the Wall Street Journal did,
469000	472000	they essentially called in to your employer to get you sacked,
472000	476000	not because anyone writing the actual report was hurt or upset by the video in question,
476000	478000	but because it would make a spicy story,
478000	484000	If any of them actually cared, they wouldn't have waited a month before the topic of YouTube was galvanised by the times before putting in a call,
484000	486000	it seemed opportunistic and rather expedient.
486000	490000	People don't like that, regardless of what they may think of a distasteful joke.
490000	495000	In the article they also claim that PewDiePie had made 9 videos with quote anti-semitic jokes or Nazi imagery,
495000	497000	a claim that was lambasted by basically everyone.
497000	501000	Let's just say they're operating some intense ratios on their YouTube channel.
501000	506000	But you do remember there being a Wall Street Journal article written on the topic of YouTube demonetisation right?
506000	510000	After all, that was what the whole H3 debacle was about, I'll refresh everyone's memory.
510000	515000	You see, on March 21st, over a month after the original problems were surfaced by the times,
515000	521000	Google's Chief Business Officer, Philip Schindler, addressed many of the concerns on a blog post that explained the changes that they would be making.
521000	525000	Now for anyone with decent YouTube experience, they understood what this meant,
525000	529000	not everything will be immediately sorted, but with the patience of those around them, this will be resolved.
529000	534000	This is where the journal irritated people the most, because what they did is they waited a few days
534000	538000	and then dropped the story that said, oh my god, we can't believe this is still happening.
538000	542000	Unfortunately, this was going to be overshadowed by H3's rather terrible blunder.
542000	547000	However, that does not make the article any better, nor any less of another opportunistic graph.
547000	551000	It would not surprise you that one of the people who wrote the first article also wrote the second one.
551000	555000	It felt cheap, everyone anticipated that nothing would be solved immediately.
555000	559000	I'm sure the Wall Street Journal did too, but this sort of fear mongering seemed highly dishonest.
560000	566000	There was a very small minority of content that the Wall Street Journal had picked out with a fine-to-comb and overstated their influence.
566000	574000	With many of the safeguards YouTube have in place, the examples were just a case that could be found on many domain sites that anyone had free access to express themselves on.
574000	578000	Even on the Times article, they note one other example that wasn't just YouTube related.
578000	583000	It seems specific targeting for a general problem that could never be completely prevented,
583000	588000	and that is why they still write articles about it to this day, even with the amount of safeguards in.
588000	592000	Now in hindsight, I'm obviously glad the current site setup is more secure than it was before.
592000	595000	There was clearly content that I'm glad isn't being monetized.
595000	602000	It was just a shame that 99% of creators were caught in the crossfire, and the Journal did not seem particularly concerned about that.
602000	606000	And listen, they can do what they want, free press, fantastic, but people are still going to judge them for it,
606000	610000	and many feel they exploited the situation in true media fashion.
610000	614000	People also felt like they were doing it because they were waning in popularity,
614000	621000	and YouTube serving itself as heavy competition, particularly due to the move towards more opinionated commentators and a gradual distrust of the media,
621000	627000	it seemed to add up for many creators, and given the effects of the Wall Street Journal's reports, people felt a disdain towards them.
627000	634000	It didn't help that YouTube were absolute pushovers, but people were already convinced of that before the scandal, so this was not news to them.
634000	640000	With that said, despite their icon status, I actually think the Wall Street Journal were not necessarily the worst defenders in every field.
641000	646000	What they did I felt was in complete contempt, with plenty of manipulative tactics that I will be addressing later.
646000	652000	But really, I think the worst thing about the Wall Street Journal that makes it stand out was that it was mildly effective.
652000	659000	And although certain media since then hasn't been without any impact, most of it has just deflected off, and therefore been forgettable.
659000	664000	But it doesn't excuse some of the atrocious hot takes that currently exist on this wretched planet.
664000	672000	And since the main Wall Street Journal scandal, plenty of media have tried to cash in on the popularity of YouTube-related articles, and I've decided to split them into two categories.
672000	675000	The old media, and the woke media.
675000	679000	And I do this because I think the Wall Street Journal saga brought an interest from both sides.
679000	685000	There had been plenty of casual pieces in the past, but this was the controversy that brought the eyes onto YouTube,
685000	689000	and has kept people invested even when there appears to be nothing worthy of reporting.
689000	692000	The Wall Street Journal definitely bridged these two genres.
692000	699000	The important point to remember is that plenty of articles mix these two, but these are the two most prominent approaches that I've recognised.
699000	704000	I'm going to start with the old media because I don't really think the way I order these will make much difference,
704000	707000	and it does lead me to a point that I'd never really considered until thinking about this topic.
707000	714000	Being a YouTuber to many is considered an occupation, and when thinking about it, that as a classification is rather reductionist.
714000	721000	I think the old media play this to the advantage on a fairly regular basis, the idea that people are just YouTubers.
721000	726000	Which although not necessarily untrue, is not really representing the variety of creators on the platform.
726000	731000	Although I do think that those said creators do share part of the responsibility on the branding parts,
731000	733000	a lot of us do like to flaunt the label.
733000	736000	What this does though is create an image of a collective.
736000	741000	This is especially effective when the audience you're talking to isn't necessarily familiar with the website.
741000	743000	I think this is an important thing to note.
743000	747000	When some twatty musician or actor is taken down for behaving in a shitty manner,
747000	750000	people blame it on the individual, not on the industry.
750000	753000	When a YouTuber does it, the accountability becomes a lot murkier.
753000	754000	What do I mean?
754000	758000	Things like this makes me think social internet programs should be shut down.
758000	760000	It is so sad how so many people abuse the internet.
760000	764000	Sometimes I wonder if the best thing would be to just shut the internet down.
764000	769000	They are blocked in China, and many other countries are doing the same to protect their young generation.
769000	771000	They do not meet the rules of respect.
771000	776000	The world has gone to pots, these sorts of things should be banned and the sites taken down.
776000	779000	So glad my kids are grown up and want to encounter these sorts of people.
779000	781000	Can't we just get rid of YouTube already?
781000	786000	Quit giving these self-absorbed imbeciles a platform for their cruelty disguised as entertainment.
786000	791000	And of course, YouTube cooperated in this repellent, evil crime.
791000	794000	I hope this person gets his head kicked off in prison.
794000	798000	YouTube exists and thrives because of live-action trolls like this.
798000	804000	Hefty civil judgements against the ZZ Hakane creators may be the best way to help them grow up quickly.
804000	808000	Anyone who acts badly online should also have it recorded on their police record.
808000	810000	You and Greg Paul both love.
810000	813000	That last one isn't really relevant to the point I was making, I just found it very funny.
813000	817000	It is important to note that this does not necessarily represent everyone's thoughts,
817000	820000	and that there were many posts just bashing the individuals.
820000	825000	But given the overwhelming support for these comments, it did seem important to include them as examples.
825000	831000	These examples are not arguments against the publication because it's often an individual's responsibility of how they think,
831000	834000	and the information presented wasn't necessarily misleading.
834000	841000	But I personally believe that many of the beliefs held here are so baseless that they could only be the result of one-sided information.
841000	845000	There were many more hot takes on this, millennials, the left, all that jazz.
845000	847000	But these were the most YouTube-related takes.
847000	852000	And it's amazing how YouTube and the internet has established itself as its own domain,
852000	855000	despite the fact that a lot of people act as individuals on it.
855000	858000	So to have the media create that label is kinda unique.
858000	862000	I think in part it's due to the cultural monopoly and establishment that YouTube has.
862000	864000	There is no site quite like YouTube.
864000	868000	Much like some people were considered viners, the website was part of the draw.
868000	872000	It was its own genre, rather than it just being a subset of the genre.
872000	875000	You wouldn't call the authors of the articles above daily mailers,
875000	880000	because they're just columnists, many of whom would be interchangeable on other competing websites.
880000	884000	The form of entertainment that YouTube promotes is so unique that it has been given that label,
884000	887000	despite the fact that there are many different types of entertainers on YouTube.
887000	892000	The label itself underplays it and often leads to these distorted perceptions that we witness in the media,
892000	897000	causing people to assume that YouTube is just some hub for millennial pillocks jerking each other off
897000	900000	while filling Oreos with toothpaste and feeding it to homeless people.
900000	902000	A statement only partly true.
902000	903000	I jest, once again.
903000	904000	But my point still stands.
904000	909000	I've noticed a huge increase in volume of these types of stories on sites like the Daily Mail,
909000	910000	who didn't used to cover this,
910000	915000	but now they're borderline acting as any trending topic channel just for an outsider's point of view.
915000	918000	And I am 100% serious about that statement.
918000	924000	However, the audience naivety allows them to appear more unbiased or being very selective with the information they present,
924000	928000	and therefore leading to a more inductive message about the greater state of YouTube,
928000	930000	causing people to not see it in perspective.
930000	934000	YouTube is still new to many people, and first impressions mean a lot.
934000	939000	Just try not to get your first impressions through sites like the Daily Mail and you'll be alright.
939000	944000	So while more traditionalist sites like the Daily Mail appeal to the less well-versed individuals
944000	947000	on what social media is really like, what do you have on the other side?
947000	951000	Well, you have people who clearly know more about the YouTube system,
951000	954000	but are just inductive in so many different and irritating ways.
954000	957000	Whereas our former example makes general statements about the platform,
957000	962000	the woke media prefer to go after specific people with a personal grudge like no other.
962000	968000	It'll often stem from the sort of very high detail probing journalism that I'm going to be looking into very soon,
968000	971000	with numerous lines of reasoning which I find a tad tentative.
971000	976000	Their technique isn't exclusive to YouTube, in fact I've noticed it a nauseating amount of times at this point,
976000	979000	but for some reason they do have specific distates for YouTube.
979000	984000	My general hunch is that it's because YouTube politically does have individuals who are less PC,
984000	987000	and those who are not big on the journalistic agenda.
987000	990000	Like the gaming industry which I explained in my Bully Hunters video,
990000	995000	it's a bit more blasé, and does have some fairly outspoken figures on some gaming-related incidents.
995000	999000	What I find the woke media to do is to take up the cause of something moral,
999000	1002000	and then make a ridiculous argument relating back to it,
1002000	1005000	followed by a justification that bases itself in a logical fallacy,
1005000	1009000	and then a conclusion that a person is doing something much worse than they actually are,
1009000	1014000	while using the moral cause to fall back onto an at least existent amount of support.
1014000	1018000	I thought we'd do a practical with this, as it happens on a fairly regular basis.
1018000	1023000	One of the examples that epitomises this to a recent extent was a situation with PewDiePie,
1023000	1027000	in which Motherboard, the Vice-owned domain, took his video he made on Alinity,
1027000	1031000	and well, the title clearly shows we're going to be in for a rollercoaster ride.
1031000	1036000	Now what follows is a line of dishonest arguments that make mild comments seem like borderline hate speech,
1036000	1041000	so let's use my little classification just to identify the little ticks they've used here.
1041000	1045000	What's the moral cause? Women's rights. I like women's rights.
1045000	1048000	Sounds good to me, lads. What's the ridiculous argument?
1048000	1051000	I mean, there are multiple ones, but for the sake of not prolonging this anymore,
1051000	1053000	let's just say that PewDiePie is, quote,
1053000	1057000	telling his audience that millions of men are not responsible for their actions,
1057000	1060000	and that when women dress a certain way, they are asking for it.
1060000	1062000	What is the baseless justification?
1062000	1065000	Well, in this instance, it appears to be a slippery slope,
1065000	1068000	that somehow PewDiePie pointing out that Alinity was behaving sexually,
1068000	1071000	and not just a bra strap showing like this article implies,
1071000	1077000	is somehow leading to people believing that women are asking for it when they wear revealing clothing.
1077000	1082000	The author references comments that really don't prove anything other than the fact that they agree with PewDiePie,
1082000	1085000	and even then, if they had been more vulgar, what would they have proven?
1085000	1089000	Not much from my point of view, because most of PewDiePie's content was his opinion,
1089000	1095000	and being persuaded by opinions is different to being persuaded by per se one-sided facts,
1095000	1097000	as I noted earlier with my Daily Mail point.
1097000	1103000	Opinions are by nature biased, and therefore unless the factual premises that you base your opinions in are misleading,
1103000	1108000	then you can't really be prosecuted for other people judging the situation in your favour,
1108000	1110000	whether it's done in an eloquent manner or not.
1110000	1114000	You haven't proven that what PewDiePie said was overly one-sided or misleading,
1114000	1118000	so you don't have the privilege to use fan responses as arguments.
1118000	1123000	The only comment you claim to be taking out context isn't provided with the context, so I can't really comment on it,
1123000	1127000	but even then, it's a very, very small reason of why people might dislike her,
1127000	1130000	and doesn't relate to any of the comments you cite.
1130000	1133000	And, before we get pulled away from what we're actually discussing,
1133000	1138000	what is the idea that the individual in question has done something much worse than what has actually happened?
1138000	1141000	Well, I mean the author's slippery slope has already done that,
1141000	1146000	but basically the author implies that PewDiePie is responsible for various abuse Alinity has received,
1146000	1149000	and that he is part of the problem that causes streamers like her to be sexualised.
1149000	1154000	This argument itself has been covered multiple times in depth, and I'll leave that up to you.
1154000	1157000	But personally, I do recommend watching the video banning PewDiePie,
1157000	1165000	and although I was intrigued by the article at first, watching the video gave it a lot of context that made me realise that this was some real grasping at straws.
1165000	1170000	So, now we've distinguished between the two, the old media rely on stating facts in a plain way,
1170000	1177000	that although not necessarily false, can create a one-sided image that lead people to fill in the gaps with their own ideas of what YouTube is.
1177000	1180000	On the other hand, the woke media tries to fill in the gaps themselves,
1180000	1185000	but with ideas that appear so absurd to me, they really just seem like personal smear campaigns.
1185000	1190000	So I thought I'd devote this next part to explaining various tactics that I've identified within the media,
1190000	1194000	spot the little tricks, and then go and apply it to a little article that we mentioned earlier.
1194000	1198000	Coming fresh out of the PewDiePie article, you probably remember that I used the phrase, slippery slope.
1198000	1204000	A slippery slope is an argument that basically one thing could have a greater collateral effect, and thus lead to something worse.
1204000	1210000	An example of this would be those who say that gay marriage will lead to the inevitable destruction of the western society.
1210000	1214000	The slippery slope is one of the favourite tactics used by a lot of these publications,
1214000	1219000	because by doing it they can make something out to be much more impactful than it initially would appear to be.
1220000	1225000	Much alike to the people who use your political position to say how it could actually lead to Marxism or Nazism,
1225000	1227000	even if you're not one of them yourself.
1227000	1230000	The real issue is that a slippery slope can sometimes exist,
1230000	1236000	it's just such a subjective concept that anyone can use it to their advantage to create enemies out of the most moderate people.
1236000	1240000	I'd urge you to always check the source material in these instances,
1240000	1245000	as context really shows whether it can be taken as or lead to something worse than it actually is.
1245000	1248000	For my next part, I chose the recent Elon Musk debacle,
1248000	1253000	in which he decided to take on the media in a series of tweets that went at them for their alleged dishonesty.
1253000	1256000	Now I must stress that Elon Musk is not a YouTuber,
1256000	1260000	but as I said earlier, journalistic tactics like these are not exclusive to YouTube,
1260000	1263000	they're a general thing which I think is important to apply.
1263000	1269000	Musk's idea of Pravda, which is rating the media on their trustworthiness a separate site, is intriguing,
1269000	1272000	although it would need much more elaboration before any judgement could be passed on it.
1272000	1277000	However, the media were not happy, and they took up certain narratives that were fairly transparent,
1277000	1280000	in fact it was so transparent that it basically became a meme.
1280000	1285000	Now Elon Musk, regardless of whether his motivations were self-driven, which they probably were,
1285000	1291000	said what a lot of people were thinking, his statement on how the media were lacking trust is fairly reasonable,
1291000	1294000	yet many journalists decided to compare him to Trump, I wonder why.
1294000	1298000	Basically Donald Trump, as I said earlier, is another passionate critic of the media,
1298000	1302000	he's also rich, like Elon Musk, and he's also not the most popular gent with many people.
1302000	1306000	Yet Musk and Trump's attitudes are completely different on many behalfs,
1306000	1309000	in fact, in what must be one of the worst attempts to dunk on Musk,
1309000	1313000	The Guardian made a quiz of who said it, Donald Trump or Elon Musk,
1313000	1316000	and I got full marks, not because I'm a superfan of either,
1316000	1319000	but because they're really quite easy to distinguish on many halves.
1319000	1324000	Anyway, besides the fact that Donald Trump and Elon Musk generally don't have that much in common,
1324000	1329000	their arguments on this topic were similar, heaven forbid, you share an opinion on something.
1329000	1332000	The media do this mainly to get the surface level impressions,
1332000	1336000	people see a title like, what Elon Musk and Donald Trump don't get about journalism,
1336000	1341000	and it sounds like they're pals, even though it's not necessarily wrong, it's manipulative.
1341000	1346000	This article, which was randomly chosen by the way from a plethora of Musk-Trump articles,
1346000	1350000	continuously references them as if for some reason Trump is a necessary inclusion.
1350000	1355000	We already know Trump's criticisms of the media as if he hasn't fucking tweeted about them enough,
1355000	1359000	he has not presented anything new in the last few weeks as far as I'm concerned.
1359000	1363000	Also compare and contrast the descriptions of the characters within this article,
1363000	1367000	on one hand you have the thin-skinned Tesla founder and CEO,
1367000	1373000	and the investigative news non-profit reveal, and they were merely reporting on safety issues,
1373000	1376000	and in response Elon Musk emulates the president.
1376000	1381000	This is the sort of journalism that ticks people off, because it over-represents one side and under-represents the other,
1381000	1384000	we see it all the time, these are the small things that grate on people,
1384000	1389000	but some don't understand why it grates, well it's because these words, although not intrinsically false,
1389000	1393000	seem cherry-picked to make one side seem good and one side seem bad.
1393000	1399000	For example, I could describe H3 Productions as a comedian activist who invested hundreds of thousands of pounds
1399000	1403000	to uphold fair use on YouTube, or I could describe them as the alleged transphobe
1403000	1406000	who falsely claimed the Wall Street Journal were faking their articles.
1406000	1410000	Both of these descriptions are true, but they're not really representative of him,
1410000	1413000	in fact they're more representative of your own position,
1413000	1419000	and that's what people don't like about these articles, they give away their bias in the most subtle way.
1419000	1424000	Using words like meltdown to describe Elon Musk's response, saying that he was under pressure,
1424000	1428000	dealing with very subjective, definitive concepts that don't exactly reflect the situation,
1428000	1432000	will make the public reject them, and recognise it as dishonest.
1432000	1436000	A simple YouTube example of this would be when the media covering the PewDiePie case
1436000	1439000	classed his anti-semitic jokes as posts.
1439000	1443000	Once again, although not false, it leaves gaps to be filled by outsiders.
1443000	1448000	There was another story where Musk retweeted an article from a site with a rather sketchy reputation,
1448000	1453000	many journalists jumped on this in an attempt to dunk on him, but the public reception was lukewarm at best,
1453000	1458000	it was a weak guilt by association argument that even if true didn't necessarily change the validity of his points,
1458000	1462000	and when he did find out the website lacked reputation, he removed his endorsement.
1462000	1467000	Most people do not look into the websites that they retweet, but more what they say.
1467000	1469000	Should Musk have done that? Sure.
1469000	1473000	But did that change the points he was making exactly? Not really, no.
1473000	1475000	Even when you get to the opinion, they're ridiculously weak,
1475000	1480000	one claiming that these journalistic websites couldn't be in the pocket of any fossil fuel gas company
1480000	1483000	because they'd written articles on some fossil fuel or gas companies.
1483000	1489000	Now, despite the obvious fact that any media site could be in the pocket of one, whilst smearing the competitors,
1489000	1494000	the links that the author references have the most recent article on such a topic two years ago,
1494000	1498000	which was about the border patrol union, as if they'd be paying companies off,
1498000	1503000	as if Elon Musk would be referencing them, and a majority of other articles that were around ten years old,
1503000	1508000	which genuinely proves jack shit considering they've written three articles about Tesla in the last sixty days.
1508000	1513000	Now I've gone off on a tangent, but please, just argue better. There is a greater point here.
1513000	1519000	Certain journalists bank on appearing confident in their references as a majority of consumers will not check them,
1519000	1522000	and just assume that because they're cited, they must be alright.
1522000	1525000	Having a link does not add credibility immediately.
1525000	1530000	Check that shit, it might actually have the additional context you need to prove the opposite.
1530000	1533000	The other thing is the titles, and this has been ran into the ground of recent.
1533000	1538000	With the increasing volume of media, titles have become increasingly more clickbaity to bring in that traffic.
1538000	1543000	So what? Most YouTubers use clickbaits to some extent too, which is relatively true.
1543000	1545000	The issue is that it's a different type of clickbait.
1545000	1548000	The media have really capitalised on what I call factbaiting,
1548000	1554000	which is this notion of stating something which is enough for people to respond to without even having to check out the actual article,
1554000	1558000	and although this statement may not be false, it's manipulative or misrepresentative.
1558000	1562000	And this is where we come back to MrBeast.
1562000	1568000	I think it's necessary to involve Twitter at this point, because Twitter has cultivated something very unique, which is retweet culture.
1568000	1575000	Basically, an article is posted, and without necessarily reading or checking it, some people either retweet it or quote tweet it.
1575000	1580000	Quote tweeting is the real interesting case, because people basically wait these provocative titles,
1580000	1583000	quote them out, and dunk on whoever they don't like through it.
1583000	1587000	It's an absolutely fascinating dynamic, but it's not particularly good for journalistic integrity.
1587000	1593000	It basically encourages the spicy takes, because if someone can get that mad dunk, then they'll hit 50k retweets,
1593000	1595000	and they'll be able to promote their soundcloud.
1605000	1609000	With the side effect leading to traffic for the article, some people will be bound to do it.
1609000	1615000	Twitter has two important factors. One, an interest in social media, and two, a rather left-wing audience.
1615000	1620000	What does that mean exactly? Well, it means that the hot takes are tailored to that demographic often.
1620000	1622000	Let's have a look at the MrBeast title, then.
1624000	1629000	That is definitely asking for it, but it didn't work. Not this time, at least. Why is that?
1629000	1634000	Well, you know how I said the Wall Street Journal struck the sweet spot between old media and woke media?
1634000	1639000	That sweet spot is not always there, and in this one, it's quite clear that they've missed the mark terribly.
1639000	1644000	In spite of his significant subscriber base, he's still too niche for most people who read old media to be interested in,
1644000	1649000	and he's too insubstantial to certain woke agendas to be worth their time either.
1649000	1653000	With a fanbase that is fairly apolitical, claims of homophobia do not concern them,
1653000	1659000	especially with the evidence lacking, and therefore, all you do is attract people who do have an interest in him,
1659000	1662000	which for a large majority are people who will be defending him.
1662000	1666000	When you read the article, the fact baiting made in the title becomes ever clearer.
1666000	1670000	The claims of a history of homophobic comments amount to him using the word fag twice,
1670000	1673000	and also saying Windows is gay while mocking his own sexuality.
1673000	1677000	Let's see what other techniques that we were discussing earlier we can notice here.
1677000	1683000	Habit of calling people thanks. Apparently, a habit is something that you do twice now in observable history. Barely true.
1683000	1688000	Jimmy showed no regret or remorse, and this is the sort of statement loaded with the fact of something he didn't do.
1688000	1695000	Let me state something else. Jimmy showed no pride or joy, both of which are true statements but send completely different messages.
1695000	1700000	The only reason that you'd have to use such a statement is if Mr. Beast should be expected to show regret or remorse,
1700000	1702000	and frankly, I do not think he should.
1702000	1708000	Before they were made aware of the comments, two YouTubers told me they considered Jimmy to be kind, humble, and earnest.
1708000	1712000	I don't really need to respond to this comment, it's just so bloody stupid.
1712000	1718000	But if you think that comments like those change a person's character, then I do not know what planet you're living on.
1718000	1721000	But homophobia runs deep in the YouTube community.
1721000	1726000	If you saw the reaction to Pogo, it's not a question of homophobia on the entertainment side of YouTube,
1726000	1729000	it's a question of what people view as homophobia.
1729000	1735000	Personally, I do not think this is homophobia, and to imply such, I find a real watering down of what we view it as.
1735000	1741000	There are so many statements that people on YouTube just don't seem sensitive to in the same way that many of the media are,
1741000	1743000	and that creates a real disconnect.
1743000	1748000	The author Taylor Enns says he regularly uses homosexuality as a punchline,
1748000	1752000	despite the fact that the examples she lists are over the span of three years.
1752000	1755000	Given the volume of your examples, how can you consider that regular?
1755000	1759000	It is a rotten piece, not because anything in it is an explicit lie,
1759000	1764000	but because it walks so close to the line of lying in an attempt to tell something mildly interesting.
1764000	1770000	If we're reaching the point where such methods are being chosen over presenting facts in an honest and just way,
1770000	1773000	in favour of just really lazy journalism piggybacking on moral causes,
1773000	1778000	which it really has no actual vested interest in, must I remind you, that I'm not on board.
1778000	1782000	It's taken something positive and said, how do we attack this character?
1782000	1787000	Let me tell you this, this article said much more about your character than his.
1787000	1790000	And that's the thing, when I made my Great Pool video,
1790000	1796000	I assembled so many various ideas on how something can state a greater narrative about his character from the way he behaves.
1796000	1799000	You literally just search MrBeast using the word fag.
1799000	1804000	What does that say about him? If anything at all, it is just sad, miserable reporting.
1804000	1809000	The problem is, the industry has developed this whole technique of loopholes to not exactly lie,
1809000	1811000	but convey information in a manipulative fashion.
1811000	1817000	I don't think there's any way to regulate it, and I don't think you should, but more attention should be brought to it.
1817000	1822000	So people's mentality in a way evolves as to not gratify the bad journalists in these endeavours.
1822000	1826000	YouTube has appeared to be a particular target of the media,
1826000	1831000	mainly because it finds itself too modern for many publications and their audiences, and too edgy for others.
1831000	1835000	This does not mean that every article printed on a YouTuber will be badly written,
1835000	1840000	nor does it mean that YouTubers will not be deserving of public criticism from time to time.
1840000	1843000	Let me make that clear. People should be open to criticism.
1843000	1849000	But when the BBC are claiming that YouTube could be encouraging kids to eat calories because they posed with unhealthy food,
1849000	1851000	people become pissed off.
1851000	1855000	And really, I find what I've said today more helpful in distinguishing the good from the bad.
1855000	1861000	If you're reading an article, just see how it presents its arguments, how it uses that language, and how its references check out.
1861000	1867000	It may not just be pivotal in defining your opinion on that situation, but on the credibility of what you're reading.
1867000	1873000	Because at the end of the day, the news should not define your opinion, it should provide the foundations for you to craft your own opinion.
1873000	1878000	But if you do see a good, honest article, go give it some love, encourage it, see who the author is, send them some love.
1878000	1880000	Because that's what we need more of.
1880000	1886000	For the media, for you, people have lost their faith, and judging from some articles, it's quite clear why.
1886000	1892000	If you want to win them back, it's gonna be a slow process, and the way you respond to criticism has not been working well either.
1892000	1895000	However, that's a topic that I might just save for another time.
1895000	1896000	I think you've suffered enough.
1896000	1903000	I hope you can improve, because the media does play a necessary role in modern life, and people would love to be able to trust you.
1903000	1907000	It's not like people enjoy being skeptical, it's just the position that you've put us in.
1907000	1912000	Anyhow, this video turned out slightly longer than I intended it to be, but I found I had a lot to say.
1912000	1917000	There were things that I planned to talk about that I didn't even manage to do that, so I guess I'll be saving that for another time.
1917000	1919000	There's always more to discuss.
1919000	1924000	What are your thoughts? I'd love to hear. I tend to respond to a lot of comments in the first few hours, and then I'll let them simmer.
1925000	1931000	However, you can still reach me on Twitter, at TheRightOpinion, I have open DMs, and on Facebook, I'll leave the links down below.
1931000	1934000	I'll also be in my Discord sometimes, basically everything under the sun.
1934000	1938000	Also, make sure you check out and subscribe to the editors if you have the time.
1938000	1944000	They do a stand-up job in making this content come together, and it would not be the same without them, so please go and send them some love.
1944000	1947000	With regards to the love, thank you for all the support.
1947000	1950000	It has been great at recent, and honestly, it means the world to me.
1950000	1952000	Please guys, do take care of yourselves.
1952000	1956000	Until then however, I'm TheRightOpinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
