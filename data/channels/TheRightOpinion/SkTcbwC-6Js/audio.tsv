0	10100	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
10100	17200	And today we return to the more relaxed side of YouTube, because honestly, all the high stakes stuff like Marina Joyce was just too riveting,
17200	20400	and I don't want to have to put you guys through that emotional trauma again.
20400	26800	So we're going to the vlogging scene, because I have dabbled in that before, however this time we're taking a trip for a very different purpose,
26800	28700	for a very different individual.
28700	32200	You see, I first heard about Emma Chamberlain when a friend mentioned her to me in passing,
32200	37200	told me that it would make a good video, and there was a lot of content to discuss, I mean he himself had made videos too.
37200	44200	I encountered her again when I was making my beauty community video, I was doing research on people who were involved in that sort of area and she came up.
44200	49000	Now I didn't include her in that video because I didn't really consider her necessarily part of that community,
49000	53800	but she was working with individuals like James Charles and so on, so I rightfully stumbled into her.
53800	60200	I knew there were a lot of videos being made and I was like, alright, she looks like a fairly regular lass, you know, whatever floats your boat.
60200	66800	There were more videos, and more videos, and I still didn't know what was happening, but now I finally had a bit more time freed up,
66800	73200	I decided to look into it, because with a bit of research I can fairly affirmatively say that this is a very interesting case.
73200	81200	So Emma Chamberlain, she is a 17 year old vlogger, and the very successful one at that, which you know, not depressing in the slightest, who cares, not me.
82200	89000	Anyhow, vlogging is an incredibly saturated genre, I've had friends who try vlogging and it did not work out for them,
89000	94200	mainly because I think it's so hard to define yourself with something that so many other people have access to.
94200	99400	The only thing that really makes the genre particularly unique is the fact that people seem to enjoy themselves doing it,
99400	105200	which probably explains why so many people do actually vlog, I mean, in a way, if I could do something like that, I probably would.
105200	108800	One day my friends, the vlogging opinion will be a reality, I'm sure.
108800	115600	But Emma Chamberlain isn't just any vlogger, in fact, many have branded her the anti-vlogger, and I think that's a very interesting way to describe her.
115600	121800	You see, her brand is definitely unique, and it's clear why her ascension to the top of the YouTube totem pole was so rapid.
121800	128400	She has this very sardonic, identifiable tone that doesn't really fit him with the normal YouTube vlogger vibes.
128400	131800	And I think this is interesting in the whole context of the vlogging scene.
131800	138400	This one would be really good for your cousin, who just got accepted into Alpha Pi, and is so excited.
138400	140500	He's probably a douchebag, this is great for him.
140500	142200	I'd flex, but I like this shirt.
142200	144300	Ha ha ha ha ha! So funny.
144300	147700	He would definitely wear that to a frat party, and no girls would talk to him.
147700	149700	But he doesn't know that that's gonna happen, so it's okay.
149700	155800	There's been this narrative drummed up recently that many creators themselves have fallen out of touch with the desires of their viewers.
155800	160500	And honestly, on one hand, it's a sentiment that I agree with, particularly with that in the vlogging industry.
160500	165100	But on the flip side, I also feel that part of the change has been undertaken by the audience.
165100	168600	The shift in general sentiment, rather than the creators necessarily.
168600	174400	We have definitely become more cynical, and I think that has made many of the vloggers and their ploys more transparent.
174400	178300	Fame does what it does to a lot of people, it pushes people into their own little bubble.
178300	183100	And I don't think that has changed necessarily, I just think people are more increasingly aware of it.
183100	188400	Emma Chamberlain definitely plays into that self-awareness, with the sort of snark and sass desperately needed.
188400	191900	And we'll explore the success very soon, but it does have its flaws.
191900	195900	In the last few months, as noted, Emma Chamberlain's been in a bit of hot water.
195900	197700	Drama, drama, and drama.
197700	205100	Firstly for a merchandising situation, and then for behaviours that just show a double standard that didn't match her attitude of the old content.
205100	209500	This in a way goes hand in hand with a lot of the rise of commentary on these creators.
209500	212900	We've definitely become much more critical towards the vlogging community.
212900	216600	This is for better and for worse, as documented in my previous videos.
216600	223900	On one hand, it pushes the community for higher standards, on the other, I think sometimes the criticism can lean into unreasonable territories.
223900	229700	And at the end of the day, it's important that we, as creators, have some sort of gauge on the criticism that we deliver.
229700	237000	I've often crashed with my fellow creators over the notion of criticising our peers, because in many ways, a cohesive community is a functional one.
237000	239800	And doing that is often seen as quote, burning bridges.
239800	244500	But at The Right Opinion, we always come equipped with a Molotov cocktail, so cheers to that.
244500	247400	There will be some times when I agree, some times when I don't.
247400	253700	Today we participate in the exercise of critical thinking, because Emma Chamberlain has been the subject of extensive criticism,
253700	259100	that itself should be brought into the light and scrutinised, just like Emma Chamberlain has been herself.
259100	264800	The central narrative is that Emma Chamberlain has changed, which on one hand isn't a huge deal,
264800	271500	we as individuals typically evolve, and it wouldn't be fair to hold people to previous standards they may have denounced or left behind.
271600	277100	But on the other hand, people say that she has changed in a way that undermines her platform in the first place,
277100	280300	basically turning her into everything that she would hate or mock.
280300	286100	This has led to a lot of videos calling her a hypocrite, and content that eschewed her for supposed double standards.
286100	292500	However, I think they may in fact underlie an overarching problem in the industry that I think has been overlooked by the situation.
292500	296900	So join me, The Right Opinion, as we take a trip back into the vlogging industry,
296900	303700	because although Zoella and Alfie Deyes were tasty topics, the appetite has readily returned, and I suggest we address that now.
303700	310100	The plan shall be to break down the old style, bloggers, explain why Emma has emerged, the subsequent criticism of her,
310100	313900	and then break it all down in a hopefully concise style.
313900	318500	So join me as we ask ourselves, did Emma Chamberlain become everything she hated?
318500	322700	In the words of Kyle from Behind The Meme, here we go.
326900	341700	Music
341700	345300	Vlogging has really emerged in the last few years, and I've documented this before,
345300	348900	but there is something very intimate about the relationship that is created.
348900	352900	When we look over the last few years, we can see a very interesting trend.
352900	359700	There are creators like Alfie Deyes, Tyler Oakley, Zoella, Casper Lee, who really came out as the bloggers to be reckoned with.
359700	363700	Now I've said this before, and I'll probably say it again, but I don't really rate them,
363700	367300	mainly because I honestly found them far too saccharine for my bitter taste.
367300	374900	Guess who's back, back, back, back again, again, again, Alfie's back. Tell your friends.
374900	378700	Truly enlightening content, my heart leaps with exuberance.
378700	383300	As creators, we typically need a journey to go from one strength to another strength.
383300	387500	A viewer needs that feeling of progression, and that reason to keep watching the videos.
387500	393100	With the new technological developments, it provided a quality that definitely contributed to this movement forward,
393100	395700	and brought us into a new era of creators.
395700	400500	This led to a lot of videos of basically people doing challenges, reactions, and so on.
400500	403700	They weren't really that meaningful, but it was something to look at.
403700	405300	It was a progression.
405300	408700	However, that was really part of the clickbait, because once you enter the video,
408700	412900	you're normally met with some sort of bloke who's walking along with your life, and there you go.
412900	416500	Another huge appeal was that these people tended to collaborate a lot,
416500	421100	and that created a greater syndicate where people were watching to see their favourite creators,
421100	423900	in the most ambitious pre-Infinity War crossover.
423900	427300	These were all components that worked at the time, because it was something new,
427300	430500	it was something that YouTube audiences weren't particularly familiar with,
430500	434900	and along with it came very specific personalities, these relatable happy people,
434900	441700	because back then, demographics and culture just seemed to be aspiring for something a bit happier than what we're looking for today.
441700	445700	These happy friends, seeing each other, doing all these wacky challenges,
445700	451300	haha, wow, those two guys kissed, isn't that craaaaazy?
451300	452300	I want to die.
452300	456100	The thing is, that it seems over the last couple of years we have evolved our tastes,
456100	460900	and no longer want everyone to be friends anymore, we no longer want people to just be collaborating,
460900	462100	because it gets boring.
462100	467100	And anyway, another more creative, more interesting genre has taken the place of that idea,
467100	471100	it's called storytime animation, and I've had my criticisms of those creators,
471100	477500	but let me tell you, on a purely entertainment-based value, they beat the old community bloggers on every single front,
477500	481500	and they do something else, which is much more genius, they appeal to nostalgia,
481500	485900	which is not only timeless, but always something looked on with more rose-coloured glasses,
485900	491500	thus matching the tone of Glee much more, and as culture itself becomes much darker in the last few years,
491500	495900	I mean hell, one of the biggest songs of 2017 was the Suicide Hotline number,
495900	499900	these old community bloggers are starting to look like they've been left behind.
499900	503900	There are many other elements that have played into their failure, the lack of progression,
503900	508100	I mean, they've all bought their mansion, cosied out to themselves, what else are they gonna do?
508100	512900	But it's more than just that, this is where we reintroduce commentary, which as mentioned earlier,
512900	516900	we have become a lot more critical of the culture that these creators promote,
516900	519900	and one that many viewers have grown to despise.
519900	524100	The thing about those bloggers is they rose in a time where criticism was very seldom,
524100	528500	and things like YouTuber merch were not scrutinised or held to any sort of account.
528500	533900	At the end of the day, you buy them or you don't, and what a lot of bloggers did was create expensive branding,
533900	539300	and when individuals like JackMate came onto the scene, they picked a lot of the community apart.
539300	542300	These are people who have never dealt with criticism like this before,
542300	548100	and I think whether I agree with the criticism or not, as expressed, whether I agree with the character depictions,
548100	552900	one thing that I do agree with is that a lot of the creators crafted a contradiction within their content.
552900	557700	They wanted to be this boy slash girl next door who was looking out for you while living in a mansion
557700	563900	and selling merchandise at rather extortionate prices, exploiting the consumer while telling them they cared about them.
563900	567900	I don't think living a wealthy life means selling out your core appeal necessarily,
567900	573100	but I think the problem was they were trying to emulate this persona that these circumstances no longer supported,
573100	575300	and therefore a lot of them felt forced.
575300	580900	So what has happened? Well, vlogging has appeared to go the way of the anti-hero of recent.
580900	586300	We don't want people who try to be perfect human beings and transcend us with their wonderful advice,
586300	591300	because at the end of the day, none of us are perfect, and given the sheer misery in the last couple years,
591300	595100	we don't want unconditionally happy people. Those days are gone.
595100	601100	Come of the hour, come of the obnoxious, inappropriate, but still somewhat redeemable characters.
601100	604500	We were looking for an edge, and that transformation was coming gradually.
604500	609500	People seemed increasingly desperate for a defining feature rather than just the fact that they were friends,
609500	613900	and they existed, and they did challenges. This was a new energy to a lot of styles.
613900	615700	Compare the past popular vlogger,
615700	620700	And my new boots. These are from Russell and Bromley,
620700	630900	and they are perfect for rainy, cold days where you've got to stretch around town getting all the last minute presents.
630900	635900	You're going to stay here. You look so tiny compared to that unit.
635900	637900	Right, we can jump in the car and make our way into town.
637900	642500	We've got the radio tunes on. Heart Extra X-mas.
642500	644500	To a present popular vlogger.
644500	647900	I've been cooped up, bro. With so much work.
647900	648900	I just want to go out and do best.
648900	649900	Let's go do best.
649900	650900	Past.
650900	655300	Well, this video today that we're filming for my main, my Pointless Vlog channel,
655300	658300	this is going to be a super interesting video.
658300	662300	Like, I'm super, super interested in the topic. I'm really, really excited to get talking about it.
662300	663300	Present.
663300	665300	Isn't it surprising his nanny with $10,000 today?
665300	667300	Why?
667300	669300	Vlogmas is a bitch.
669300	671300	Fuck, we don't have any video today?
671300	673300	Oh, this is great.
673300	675300	Take it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
675300	677300	Hey, mailman.
677300	679300	How would you like 10 grand?
679300	684300	Also, this kind of explains why a lot of the older vloggers were British and the newer ones are American.
684300	687300	I mean, can you see Zoella being that loud and out there?
687300	688300	I'm just saying.
688300	691300	I feel like this has been happening over the last few years with these new vloggers.
691300	696300	The reason I'm saying this is because I think some people see Chamberlain as a dramatic shift
696300	700300	but I much more see her as a completion of a very interesting cycle
700300	703300	to finally expel the previous generation of vloggers
703300	707300	who themselves were viewed as these rather softly elitist bunch of creators
707300	710300	who enabled a facade when the truth was much different
710300	713300	and whereas other new vloggers have certainly challenged that
713300	716300	there is still an element of superficiality
716300	719300	and that's what changes with Emma Chamberlain.
727300	732300	So with this video I decided to undertake a lot of research into Emma's content, past and present
732300	735300	to understand what really makes her so bloody special.
735300	738300	When she started she appeared to do these sorts of travel vlogs
738300	740300	which didn't really take off as content
740300	743300	but definitely set up some of her very idiosyncratic traits.
743300	746300	That means basically traits that are identifiable to yourself.
753300	757300	You see, at first her videos were rooted in the very traditional vlog formula
757300	761300	the very Casey Neistat style idea.
761300	764300	What you do is what shapes the vlogs and makes them interesting
764300	767300	and someone like Neistat does really capture that
767300	769300	but it didn't really work for her
769300	772300	maybe because as a smaller YouTuber you can't quite capture
772300	775300	the sheer grandiosity of a life like Neistat's
775300	779300	and you're competing with people who have so many more resources than yourself.
779300	784300	What appeared to change was when she dipped into actually a more commentary oriented style
784300	787300	with videos such as We Owe The Dollar Store An Apology
787300	789300	and her first day of school vlog.
789300	792300	As you see, here's what Zoella had to say about school.
800300	802300	No, actually I want to learn this today
802300	805300	or no, I'm going to really concentrate on what my teacher is saying to me right now
805300	808300	because I don't want you distracting me.
808300	812300	Don't stay up all night watching YouTube videos.
812300	816300	And Emma Chamberlain had some very different words of wisdom.
816300	821300	I have to go back to the one place that sucks out all of the happiness out of my life
821300	822300	and that is school.
822300	824300	Nothing about this situation excites me.
824300	826300	Nothing about that makes me want to smile.
827300	830300	If I try to vlog at school I'm probably going to get my phone taken away.
830300	833300	But you know what? I don't even care because YouTube is life
833300	837300	and YouTube is better than school so I prioritise this over school.
837300	841300	Watching the videos I received the idea that Zoella has this sort of same impression
841300	843300	of school that Emma Chamberlain does
843300	846300	and if they were to sit down and discuss what they don't like about school they'd probably agree.
846300	849300	The difference is that Emma Chamberlain doesn't sugar coat her words.
849300	852300	She doesn't talk down to the audience like she's been there.
852300	854300	She just says she absolutely loathes school
854300	858300	and although the brave face argument may serve as somewhat better advice on Zoella's part
858300	864300	people still have that voice in their head that represents the unfiltered judgemental critical nihilistic view
864300	868300	that Emma Chamberlain was never afraid to hold back on and deliver with the most brute honesty.
868300	873300	A famous Freudian theory documents that of the id, the ego, and the superego
873300	876300	represented on this little diagram here.
876300	881300	Now generally I don't rate Freud too much as a guy who provided decent amounts of evidence
881300	885300	and this idea I think is very reductionist of how the human mind works.
885300	891300	It's not that simple to categorise, however it does somewhat represent the conflict that many of us have.
891300	895300	The id is typically seen as what represents our more self-centred desires
895300	898300	and we typically internalise that, but it still exists.
898300	903300	Whereas the ego is the more reasonable side and the superego is the very selfless aspect.
903300	908300	Emma seems to have taken this formula and just shoved the ego and superego out the window
908300	912300	and left us with this rather straightforward depiction of a pissed off teenager
912300	916300	who has to go to a shitty school and learn things that she'll never have to apply.
916300	919300	No one really wants to admit it, but she does really relate to them.
919300	923300	But Chamberlain's success doesn't stop there, there is a nuance to it,
923300	925300	and that's where we talk about the delivery.
925300	928300	In her first Q&A Emma is asked about her inspirations,
928300	932300	she lists Neistat which can be particularly represented in her early vlogs
932300	936300	and then Cody Ko who is obviously quite a different style of creator.
937300	944300	However, what I found even more interesting is the fact that her favourite show was The Office
944300	946300	which once again, a great comedy.
946300	951300	But she also said her favourite character was Dwight who represents that more cynical creation,
951300	956300	although his love for the system is probably running counter to Chamberlain's express hatred for it.
956300	959300	She's clearly been very much in touch with the YouTube atmosphere,
959300	961300	she says she's been watching it forever,
961300	966300	and on top of that her knowledge of comedy and commentary definitely shines through in the best of her content,
966300	971300	particularly in the edits which capture an energy probably even stronger than her favourites like Cody Ko.
971300	975300	So with all this in mind, what I find very smart about Emma Chamberlain's style
975300	979300	is that she basically wrapped what could have been rather obnoxious entitled rants
979300	983300	in a seething tone that seemed to undermine that negativity,
983300	987300	and when she did go on rants it felt somewhat justified and relatable to an audience,
987300	988300	such as her school rants.
988300	992300	She followed this school rant with a discussion about her school uniform,
992300	996300	and this could have been rather innocuous and not the sort of thing that would create any tonal variety
996300	998300	following on from her rant about school,
998300	1002300	but she changes it up, and sarcastically mocks how rigid school uniforms are
1002300	1005300	by presenting them like some sort of frock for a fashion show.
1005300	1009300	Emma Chamberlain- You can see we have the nice quarter zip looking thing we have here,
1009300	1015300	nice very trendy pleated skirt, because you know pleated skirts are so in this season,
1015300	1020300	Vans socks, super trendy and cute, and some white Vans.
1020300	1023300	I like this, I think this is pretty damn good content,
1023300	1027300	and much more refreshing than a lot of previous creators who I could never relate to,
1027300	1031300	but Chamberlain appeals to the inner cynic, the inner nihilist, hell the inner hedonist,
1031300	1034300	and when she was in that situation that many people were in,
1034300	1039300	and evoked a much more honest reaction than many people really have the balls to do,
1039300	1043300	it was cathartic for viewers in a way to have someone to just be able to go off like that.
1043300	1047300	Chamberlain represented the vlogger that people didn't have to aspire to be,
1047300	1049300	because they already were.
1049300	1053300	The brand anti-vlogger I feel isn't quite right, I feel kinda differently,
1053300	1057300	she just represented a vlogger that even in her arguably imperfect state,
1057300	1061300	people could trust, people knew that what they saw was what she felt,
1061300	1065300	and that's overwhelming in a genre that is derided by many as fake
1065300	1068300	and creating this unreal idea of people's lives.
1068300	1070300	Let me bring this back to commentary then,
1070300	1074300	one of the greatest criticisms that we had of vloggers was that they were disingenuous
1074300	1078300	and were acting like they had all this love for their viewers when this wasn't the case
1078300	1080300	and they were clearly out to benefit themselves.
1080300	1084300	Chamberlain skips the middleman and doesn't deceive her viewers with what she cares about,
1084300	1088300	this allows her to undermine the usual criticism that she is feigning
1088300	1091300	an excessive amount of interest for the audience's wellbeing
1091300	1097300	because to actually make that claim there first needs to exist an excessive amount of interest for the audience's wellbeing.
1097300	1100300	And so like anyone who was some exceeding quality,
1100300	1103300	which she definitely demonstrated, her content blew up,
1103300	1107300	and people tuned in from it, she seemed to represent that middle finger to the previous generations,
1107300	1111300	if you've ever watched the honest translations of politicians and such,
1111300	1116300	that's how I see Emma Chamberlain, however with the blow up came incredible success,
1116300	1120300	which appeared to threaten the very foundations that she had constructed her platform on.
1120300	1122300	So let's talk about that.
1128300	1133300	Emma Chamberlain's growth came incredibly fast,
1133300	1137300	and with her rather admirable work ethic and the consistency of her content,
1137300	1140300	meant that it just created this huge snowball effect that keeps on rolling,
1140300	1143300	however when you acquire such a reputation,
1143300	1148300	one of the things that many people will advise you to do is move to a city which is considered an entertainment hub.
1148300	1152300	The reason this is, is because although you can film a YouTube video anywhere,
1152300	1155300	there are many more opportunities that YouTube can launch,
1155300	1157300	which can only be fully realised by going places,
1157300	1161300	and the obvious choice for those in the media industry is Los Angeles, California.
1161300	1166300	Another big reason to do this is because you normally enter deals, partnerships, sponsorships,
1166300	1169300	you know, this is how the modern creator makes the real bucks,
1169300	1172300	YouTube is an unreliable method of income,
1172300	1174300	there are many more sources that provide stability,
1174300	1177300	and like anyone, Emma decided to pursue those.
1177300	1180300	One of those was the ever reliable YouTuber merchandise,
1180300	1184300	many creators, large and small, have generated a lot of additional profit for themselves,
1184300	1188300	through the trusty commodities that they can flog to their audiences,
1188300	1191300	but you see, this time there was a different, more creative idea,
1191300	1193300	you see Emma, or more likely her agents,
1193300	1197300	decided that it would be an interesting business move to pixelate the merch,
1197300	1200300	I assume to create some sort of aura of mystery,
1200300	1204300	but it didn't quite work, it more generated an aura of outrage,
1204300	1210300	because whoever was in charge of this probably was not quite in tabs with the standards that YouTube audiences set,
1210300	1213300	they want their merch affordable, and they want to be able to see it as well.
1213300	1216300	If this was done for some kind of upper class clothing brand,
1216300	1220300	it may have been lauded by critics as an avant-garde move,
1220300	1222300	but no, people just want it straight to the point,
1222300	1226300	there was also a suspicious resemblance to AliExpress merchandise,
1226300	1228300	once the presentation was actually revealed,
1228300	1231300	this caused further furor, and she did address this in a response,
1231300	1234300	in which she gave some rather erratic explanation.
1234300	1236300	Oh, back to what we were talking about,
1236300	1238300	somebody said that my clothing line's really expensive,
1238300	1241300	I'd like to say that I didn't come up with the prices for my clothing line,
1241300	1244300	yes, it's technically mine, I guess, but not really,
1244300	1247300	because all I did was design the clothes, and half of it, yeah,
1247300	1250300	so like, it's not really up to me, those things,
1250300	1253300	and honestly, I agree, I think it's really, really expensive,
1253300	1257300	and honestly, I would be a little bit triggered too.
1257300	1260300	And surprise, surprise, this didn't appease the masses either,
1260300	1263300	after all, she has to anticipate, to an extent,
1263300	1267300	that merchandise with her name will delegate her some responsibility,
1267300	1270300	it is an implicit endorsement of the prices regardless,
1270300	1273300	and that means having more foresight when you enter these deals,
1273300	1275300	and as I said in my Smosh video,
1275300	1278300	that's what makes businesses so dangerous in their influence,
1278300	1280300	you're the person who's gonna suffer the flack,
1280300	1283300	and when responding to such criticism, you have to keep that in mind,
1283300	1286300	this incident in particular really galvanised the narrative
1286300	1288300	that she had kind of sold out,
1288300	1292300	that she was essentially becoming everything that she had previously mocked and criticised,
1292300	1295300	which was supposedly illuminated by moments like these.
1296300	1299300	I've been seeing this shirt on Pinterest, I'll insert some pictures.
1303300	1306300	So, this shirt, $450.
1308300	1312300	I just, there's no way I could do this, I can't just buy a $450 shirt,
1312300	1315300	I'm not a celebrity, and I'm not loaded, so.
1315300	1316300	First we're going to Gucci.
1316300	1317300	We have to go to Gucci first.
1317300	1319300	We have to get you a Gucci belt, a good and fast gucky belt.
1319300	1322300	They're literally making me go to Gucci and spend like $400 on a Gucci belt.
1323300	1324300	No, yeah, but.
1326300	1328300	I'm feeling like a real big fat b**** right now.
1328300	1330300	Yeah, I feel like a douchebag every day carrying this around.
1330300	1331300	Yeah.
1331300	1332300	Wait, I have to.
1332300	1333300	First I got these socks.
1333300	1334300	I got a Gucci fanny pack.
1334300	1336300	No, Grayson, Grayson, you're nuts.
1336300	1337300	Just show yours that we're going one at a time.
1337300	1339300	I got my Gucci slide.
1339300	1341300	Then after that I'm gonna go thrifting for a little bit
1341300	1343300	because I need to do some hardcore thrifting,
1343300	1344300	I haven't thrifted in a very long time.
1344300	1347300	When I go thrifting, I don't feel bad about buying new things
1347300	1350300	because thrifting is so cheap, so it's not even an issue.
1350300	1353300	The other day, I was walking around Melrose in LA.
1353300	1356300	There's a lot of cool vintage stores and they're all overpriced but whatever.
1356300	1358300	I had narrowed it down to 20, but I was like,
1358300	1362300	this is going to be at least $2,000 if I buy all these jeans,
1362300	1365300	meaning that I have to narrow it down a little bit more well.
1365300	1367300	And I spent f****** dollars on jeans,
1367300	1371300	but the thing is, is that I've never been happier to do something in my life.
1371300	1373300	I was thrilled to give her all my money.
1373300	1375300	Further to this, like the community does,
1375300	1377300	there were a load more allegations dealt out.
1377300	1380300	Some to do with bullying, insensitive tweets,
1380300	1382300	and also a very bizarre one about blackface,
1382300	1385300	which is clearly just some fairly cheap makeup.
1385300	1386300	I mean, it was from the dollar store.
1386300	1389300	And what had occurred was the classic slippery slope of criticism.
1389300	1392300	As soon as one vaguely reasonable criticism came out against her,
1392300	1395300	a load more followed, each more ridiculous than the last.
1395300	1397300	However, we're going to set those aside and say,
1397300	1400300	in my opinion, I think most of them are fairly unfounded,
1400300	1402300	and without further evidence, and clear evidence at least,
1402300	1404300	it's hard to buy into them.
1404300	1406300	So I want to discuss the greater narrative itself.
1406300	1408300	That she as a person has changed.
1408300	1411300	Which, you know, looking at what we do have is a credible theory.
1411300	1415300	But the thing is, in spite of the criticism that I think can be levied against her,
1415300	1417300	with regards to her personality,
1417300	1420300	I honestly don't think she herself ever changed that much.
1420300	1422300	I think if you look at her old content,
1422300	1425300	that cynicism, that attitude, is still there.
1425300	1427300	In fact, the whole situation, in my opinion,
1427300	1430300	exposes how the only thing that changes is the circumstance
1430300	1433300	which altered the interpretation of her content.
1433300	1435300	Chamberlain was never your happy girl next door,
1435300	1437300	she wasn't a bad person per se,
1437300	1442300	but her brand was on the basis of being rather brutal and open in her pursuits for success.
1442300	1445300	Therefore, a lot of her attitude can be explained by that.
1445300	1447300	She didn't wear Gucci because she wasn't quote famous,
1447300	1450300	and now she is famous, well she's gonna wear Gucci.
1450300	1454300	I mean, she was a stingy lass who wouldn't even shell out on Spotify Premium,
1454300	1456300	and now she's probably turning in the racks.
1456300	1458300	She's probably got a Tidal account too,
1458300	1461300	which, no, isn't the most advisable thing regardless, but still.
1461300	1464300	At the end of the day, the people who put someone like Emma Chamberlain on a podium
1464300	1467300	can't be surprised in a way at these consequences.
1467300	1470300	I think many people had Emma viewed as this sort of populist vlogger
1470300	1474300	who represented that movement against the establishment of previous vloggers.
1474300	1477300	However, what I think she often represented was herself,
1477300	1480300	and because she was living a fairly regular life at that point,
1480300	1484300	that on the basis of itself tended to resonate with a lot of viewers
1484300	1486300	who also had their own concerns,
1486300	1489300	and now she's part of the industry and the circumstances have changed,
1489300	1493300	she still has those principles, they're just not as relatable.
1493300	1497300	She always came across as a rather amoral person on these issues.
1497300	1501300	But buying gifts is so stressful, every single year I have a very tough time buying gifts for people
1501300	1503300	because number one, I don't want to spend money on anyone.
1503300	1507300	That's the thing, she hasn't changed, it's just her circumstances that have.
1507300	1509300	And because Emma is no longer going to school,
1509300	1512300	because she's no longer doing the things that normal people do,
1512300	1514300	she loses that factor of being that person.
1514300	1519300	However, on the other hand, I still think she's retained a lot of these key commentary components.
1519300	1522300	One of her newest videos was very similar in tone to the older ones.
1522300	1526300	The only thing I'd say is that the editing is becoming more overbearing than her old stuff,
1526300	1530300	and although it's definitely welcome, it's sometimes a bit too much.
1532300	1533300	Let's just get right into it.
1539300	1540300	Let's get started.
1540300	1542300	Emma Chamberlain has become rich and famous,
1542300	1546300	and there will be some people that will probably not be able to relate to that
1546300	1548300	in the way that they related to Emma's old content.
1548300	1553300	However, it was a compromise Emma clearly felt was necessary to provide her with some longevity
1553300	1555300	in the case that YouTube falls through,
1555300	1559300	and she has to provide that progression that many people do look for.
1559300	1563300	She had this opportunity to go out and live her dreams with people like the Dolan twins,
1563300	1567300	and she's gonna go and do that, even if it's not my idea of the dream.
1567300	1572300	Equally, another issue is that her changing circumstances can often mean that she can't behave the same.
1572300	1575300	She always had that slightly smarmy attitude,
1575300	1578300	but now that she's successful, it can come across rather differently,
1578300	1580300	such as when she accepted the Streamy Award.
1590300	1594300	As a larger creator, you can't make a moment like that kind of awkward and sarcastic,
1594300	1597300	or else it just feels inherently condescending to the audience,
1597300	1600300	and extremely, extremely awkward.
1600300	1603300	And once again, I feel like as a person, she hasn't changed,
1603300	1605300	and that may be part of the problem,
1605300	1609300	because although I feel she should definitely retain a grip on those traits that make her content appealing,
1609300	1611300	if you want to stay in touch with your audience,
1611300	1614300	you have to be somewhat respondent to your changing relationship with them,
1614300	1617300	and the responsibility that that ensues.
1617300	1622300	With that said, she has no obligation to, and as it stands, she is relatively successful,
1622300	1626300	and although backlash is inevitable, I don't think it's significant enough to faze her,
1626300	1628300	and she still has a lot of appealing elements.
1628300	1632300	The question of this video then, was one that yielded from a lot of videos that I'd watched on her,
1632300	1634300	with those labels, and how she's changed.
1634300	1637300	Did she become everything she hated?
1637300	1639300	And I think the fallacy lies within the question in a way,
1639300	1644300	because I don't think Emma ever hated the opportunism of her previous generation,
1644300	1647300	she just never tried to cover it up in any other way necessarily,
1647300	1650300	other than the way it affected her as a person,
1650300	1656300	and at the start, she never had the opportunities that those previous generation style vloggers had.
1656300	1660300	However, her style did bring a refreshing take to those who wanted something more believable,
1660300	1664300	and that overlapped into the conflicts of interest we're witnessing today,
1664300	1669300	because those opportunities came, and she took them and did what many other vloggers have already done,
1669300	1671300	and she never claimed to be against that.
1671300	1675300	I understood that many people may argue that the fame has gone to her head,
1675300	1679300	but I think it's more the fame has changed her lifestyle in a way that differentiates it
1679300	1682300	from what made it relatable in the first place for some viewers,
1682300	1684300	and thus affecting the relationship.
1684300	1688300	I think that's irreconcilable in a way, because seeing someone whine about school
1688300	1691300	is different to seeing someone whine about something you can't relate to,
1691300	1696300	particularly in relativity to your state, seeing rich people complain is never fun.
1696300	1700300	With that said, she has mostly avoided as coming across as too petty,
1700300	1702300	and she's still doing well with audience reception,
1702300	1705300	and so in that instance, I have to give credit to her.
1705300	1707300	She's definitely slipped up from time to time,
1707300	1711300	but as someone who is 17 who has blown up so incredibly quickly,
1711300	1713300	I think she is handling it rather well.
1713300	1716300	The story of Emma Chamberlain is one that is rather interesting,
1716300	1720300	because she is a significant character in the recent evolution of blogging,
1720300	1722300	definitely representing a very new attitude.
1722300	1726300	At the same time, it seems that people wanted to associate that new attitude
1726300	1728300	with a more grassroots mentality,
1728300	1731300	when really I think she was just expressing her own interests,
1731300	1734300	and her problems, and then the people related,
1734300	1736300	and now those interests and those problems are different,
1736300	1738300	and people no longer relate.
1738300	1740300	Does that interfere with her content for some viewers?
1740300	1744300	Sure, but there are still a lot of people who find appeal within her delivery
1744300	1746300	and her style which is still unique,
1746300	1748300	and her rather savage nature,
1748300	1752300	which is something that I think can overshadow any consistencies with her past self.
1752300	1754300	Whether her new brand will prevail,
1754300	1756300	well, I guess we'll have to wait and see.
1760300	1762300	So, there was the video,
1762300	1764300	another great one, I hope you enjoyed.
1764300	1767300	I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comment section below
1767300	1769300	about what you think about Emma Chamberlain.
1769300	1771300	Has she become everything she used to mock,
1771300	1773300	or do you think there's been very little change?
1773300	1778300	On top of this, I'd like to thank all my editors who have once again done a fantastic job.
1778300	1781300	I would also like to give a special thanks to some of my Patreons
1781300	1783300	who are up there on the screen now,
1783300	1787300	and a special thanks to Ryan who is still very generously donating $100.
1787300	1791300	I'm honestly very flattered that he thinks I'm worth $100.
1791300	1793300	That's not what they thought in the brothels.
1793300	1796300	To add an extra bit in here, I also have to give a shoutout to Connor
1796300	1798300	who is my recent new $50 Patreon,
1798300	1800300	and I really appreciate it.
1800300	1802300	My throat is dying from illness right now,
1802300	1804300	but I hope this can serve as a little thank you.
1804300	1806300	Before I get a bit too edgy with my humour,
1806300	1809300	you know, the right opinions, feeling a bit mental today,
1809300	1813300	if you want to message me, you can follow me on Twitter, Facebook,
