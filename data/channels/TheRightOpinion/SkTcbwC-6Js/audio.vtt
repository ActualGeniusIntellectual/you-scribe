00:00.000 --> 00:10.100
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

00:10.100 --> 00:17.200
And today we return to the more relaxed side of YouTube, because honestly, all the high stakes stuff like Marina Joyce was just too riveting,

00:17.200 --> 00:20.400
and I don't want to have to put you guys through that emotional trauma again.

00:20.400 --> 00:26.800
So we're going to the vlogging scene, because I have dabbled in that before, however this time we're taking a trip for a very different purpose,

00:26.800 --> 00:28.700
for a very different individual.

00:28.700 --> 00:32.200
You see, I first heard about Emma Chamberlain when a friend mentioned her to me in passing,

00:32.200 --> 00:37.200
told me that it would make a good video, and there was a lot of content to discuss, I mean he himself had made videos too.

00:37.200 --> 00:44.200
I encountered her again when I was making my beauty community video, I was doing research on people who were involved in that sort of area and she came up.

00:44.200 --> 00:49.000
Now I didn't include her in that video because I didn't really consider her necessarily part of that community,

00:49.000 --> 00:53.800
but she was working with individuals like James Charles and so on, so I rightfully stumbled into her.

00:53.800 --> 01:00.200
I knew there were a lot of videos being made and I was like, alright, she looks like a fairly regular lass, you know, whatever floats your boat.

01:00.200 --> 01:06.800
There were more videos, and more videos, and I still didn't know what was happening, but now I finally had a bit more time freed up,

01:06.800 --> 01:13.200
I decided to look into it, because with a bit of research I can fairly affirmatively say that this is a very interesting case.

01:13.200 --> 01:21.200
So Emma Chamberlain, she is a 17 year old vlogger, and the very successful one at that, which you know, not depressing in the slightest, who cares, not me.

01:22.200 --> 01:29.000
Anyhow, vlogging is an incredibly saturated genre, I've had friends who try vlogging and it did not work out for them,

01:29.000 --> 01:34.200
mainly because I think it's so hard to define yourself with something that so many other people have access to.

01:34.200 --> 01:39.400
The only thing that really makes the genre particularly unique is the fact that people seem to enjoy themselves doing it,

01:39.400 --> 01:45.200
which probably explains why so many people do actually vlog, I mean, in a way, if I could do something like that, I probably would.

01:45.200 --> 01:48.800
One day my friends, the vlogging opinion will be a reality, I'm sure.

01:48.800 --> 01:55.600
But Emma Chamberlain isn't just any vlogger, in fact, many have branded her the anti-vlogger, and I think that's a very interesting way to describe her.

01:55.600 --> 02:01.800
You see, her brand is definitely unique, and it's clear why her ascension to the top of the YouTube totem pole was so rapid.

02:01.800 --> 02:08.400
She has this very sardonic, identifiable tone that doesn't really fit him with the normal YouTube vlogger vibes.

02:08.400 --> 02:11.800
And I think this is interesting in the whole context of the vlogging scene.

02:11.800 --> 02:18.400
This one would be really good for your cousin, who just got accepted into Alpha Pi, and is so excited.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.500
He's probably a douchebag, this is great for him.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.200
I'd flex, but I like this shirt.

02:22.200 --> 02:24.300
Ha ha ha ha ha! So funny.

02:24.300 --> 02:27.700
He would definitely wear that to a frat party, and no girls would talk to him.

02:27.700 --> 02:29.700
But he doesn't know that that's gonna happen, so it's okay.

02:29.700 --> 02:35.800
There's been this narrative drummed up recently that many creators themselves have fallen out of touch with the desires of their viewers.

02:35.800 --> 02:40.500
And honestly, on one hand, it's a sentiment that I agree with, particularly with that in the vlogging industry.

02:40.500 --> 02:45.100
But on the flip side, I also feel that part of the change has been undertaken by the audience.

02:45.100 --> 02:48.600
The shift in general sentiment, rather than the creators necessarily.

02:48.600 --> 02:54.400
We have definitely become more cynical, and I think that has made many of the vloggers and their ploys more transparent.

02:54.400 --> 02:58.300
Fame does what it does to a lot of people, it pushes people into their own little bubble.

02:58.300 --> 03:03.100
And I don't think that has changed necessarily, I just think people are more increasingly aware of it.

03:03.100 --> 03:08.400
Emma Chamberlain definitely plays into that self-awareness, with the sort of snark and sass desperately needed.

03:08.400 --> 03:11.900
And we'll explore the success very soon, but it does have its flaws.

03:11.900 --> 03:15.900
In the last few months, as noted, Emma Chamberlain's been in a bit of hot water.

03:15.900 --> 03:17.700
Drama, drama, and drama.

03:17.700 --> 03:25.100
Firstly for a merchandising situation, and then for behaviours that just show a double standard that didn't match her attitude of the old content.

03:25.100 --> 03:29.500
This in a way goes hand in hand with a lot of the rise of commentary on these creators.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.900
We've definitely become much more critical towards the vlogging community.

03:32.900 --> 03:36.600
This is for better and for worse, as documented in my previous videos.

03:36.600 --> 03:43.900
On one hand, it pushes the community for higher standards, on the other, I think sometimes the criticism can lean into unreasonable territories.

03:43.900 --> 03:49.700
And at the end of the day, it's important that we, as creators, have some sort of gauge on the criticism that we deliver.

03:49.700 --> 03:57.000
I've often crashed with my fellow creators over the notion of criticising our peers, because in many ways, a cohesive community is a functional one.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.800
And doing that is often seen as quote, burning bridges.

03:59.800 --> 04:04.500
But at The Right Opinion, we always come equipped with a Molotov cocktail, so cheers to that.

04:04.500 --> 04:07.400
There will be some times when I agree, some times when I don't.

04:07.400 --> 04:13.700
Today we participate in the exercise of critical thinking, because Emma Chamberlain has been the subject of extensive criticism,

04:13.700 --> 04:19.100
that itself should be brought into the light and scrutinised, just like Emma Chamberlain has been herself.

04:19.100 --> 04:24.800
The central narrative is that Emma Chamberlain has changed, which on one hand isn't a huge deal,

04:24.800 --> 04:31.500
we as individuals typically evolve, and it wouldn't be fair to hold people to previous standards they may have denounced or left behind.

04:31.600 --> 04:37.100
But on the other hand, people say that she has changed in a way that undermines her platform in the first place,

04:37.100 --> 04:40.300
basically turning her into everything that she would hate or mock.

04:40.300 --> 04:46.100
This has led to a lot of videos calling her a hypocrite, and content that eschewed her for supposed double standards.

04:46.100 --> 04:52.500
However, I think they may in fact underlie an overarching problem in the industry that I think has been overlooked by the situation.

04:52.500 --> 04:56.900
So join me, The Right Opinion, as we take a trip back into the vlogging industry,

04:56.900 --> 05:03.700
because although Zoella and Alfie Deyes were tasty topics, the appetite has readily returned, and I suggest we address that now.

05:03.700 --> 05:10.100
The plan shall be to break down the old style, bloggers, explain why Emma has emerged, the subsequent criticism of her,

05:10.100 --> 05:13.900
and then break it all down in a hopefully concise style.

05:13.900 --> 05:18.500
So join me as we ask ourselves, did Emma Chamberlain become everything she hated?

05:18.500 --> 05:22.700
In the words of Kyle from Behind The Meme, here we go.

05:26.900 --> 05:41.700
Music

05:41.700 --> 05:45.300
Vlogging has really emerged in the last few years, and I've documented this before,

05:45.300 --> 05:48.900
but there is something very intimate about the relationship that is created.

05:48.900 --> 05:52.900
When we look over the last few years, we can see a very interesting trend.

05:52.900 --> 05:59.700
There are creators like Alfie Deyes, Tyler Oakley, Zoella, Casper Lee, who really came out as the bloggers to be reckoned with.

05:59.700 --> 06:03.700
Now I've said this before, and I'll probably say it again, but I don't really rate them,

06:03.700 --> 06:07.300
mainly because I honestly found them far too saccharine for my bitter taste.

06:07.300 --> 06:14.900
Guess who's back, back, back, back again, again, again, Alfie's back. Tell your friends.

06:14.900 --> 06:18.700
Truly enlightening content, my heart leaps with exuberance.

06:18.700 --> 06:23.300
As creators, we typically need a journey to go from one strength to another strength.

06:23.300 --> 06:27.500
A viewer needs that feeling of progression, and that reason to keep watching the videos.

06:27.500 --> 06:33.100
With the new technological developments, it provided a quality that definitely contributed to this movement forward,

06:33.100 --> 06:35.700
and brought us into a new era of creators.

06:35.700 --> 06:40.500
This led to a lot of videos of basically people doing challenges, reactions, and so on.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.700
They weren't really that meaningful, but it was something to look at.

06:43.700 --> 06:45.300
It was a progression.

06:45.300 --> 06:48.700
However, that was really part of the clickbait, because once you enter the video,

06:48.700 --> 06:52.900
you're normally met with some sort of bloke who's walking along with your life, and there you go.

06:52.900 --> 06:56.500
Another huge appeal was that these people tended to collaborate a lot,

06:56.500 --> 07:01.100
and that created a greater syndicate where people were watching to see their favourite creators,

07:01.100 --> 07:03.900
in the most ambitious pre-Infinity War crossover.

07:03.900 --> 07:07.300
These were all components that worked at the time, because it was something new,

07:07.300 --> 07:10.500
it was something that YouTube audiences weren't particularly familiar with,

07:10.500 --> 07:14.900
and along with it came very specific personalities, these relatable happy people,

07:14.900 --> 07:21.700
because back then, demographics and culture just seemed to be aspiring for something a bit happier than what we're looking for today.

07:21.700 --> 07:25.700
These happy friends, seeing each other, doing all these wacky challenges,

07:25.700 --> 07:31.300
haha, wow, those two guys kissed, isn't that craaaaazy?

07:31.300 --> 07:32.300
I want to die.

07:32.300 --> 07:36.100
The thing is, that it seems over the last couple of years we have evolved our tastes,

07:36.100 --> 07:40.900
and no longer want everyone to be friends anymore, we no longer want people to just be collaborating,

07:40.900 --> 07:42.100
because it gets boring.

07:42.100 --> 07:47.100
And anyway, another more creative, more interesting genre has taken the place of that idea,

07:47.100 --> 07:51.100
it's called storytime animation, and I've had my criticisms of those creators,

07:51.100 --> 07:57.500
but let me tell you, on a purely entertainment-based value, they beat the old community bloggers on every single front,

07:57.500 --> 08:01.500
and they do something else, which is much more genius, they appeal to nostalgia,

08:01.500 --> 08:05.900
which is not only timeless, but always something looked on with more rose-coloured glasses,

08:05.900 --> 08:11.500
thus matching the tone of Glee much more, and as culture itself becomes much darker in the last few years,

08:11.500 --> 08:15.900
I mean hell, one of the biggest songs of 2017 was the Suicide Hotline number,

08:15.900 --> 08:19.900
these old community bloggers are starting to look like they've been left behind.

08:19.900 --> 08:23.900
There are many other elements that have played into their failure, the lack of progression,

08:23.900 --> 08:28.100
I mean, they've all bought their mansion, cosied out to themselves, what else are they gonna do?

08:28.100 --> 08:32.900
But it's more than just that, this is where we reintroduce commentary, which as mentioned earlier,

08:32.900 --> 08:36.900
we have become a lot more critical of the culture that these creators promote,

08:36.900 --> 08:39.900
and one that many viewers have grown to despise.

08:39.900 --> 08:44.100
The thing about those bloggers is they rose in a time where criticism was very seldom,

08:44.100 --> 08:48.500
and things like YouTuber merch were not scrutinised or held to any sort of account.

08:48.500 --> 08:53.900
At the end of the day, you buy them or you don't, and what a lot of bloggers did was create expensive branding,

08:53.900 --> 08:59.300
and when individuals like JackMate came onto the scene, they picked a lot of the community apart.

08:59.300 --> 09:02.300
These are people who have never dealt with criticism like this before,

09:02.300 --> 09:08.100
and I think whether I agree with the criticism or not, as expressed, whether I agree with the character depictions,

09:08.100 --> 09:12.900
one thing that I do agree with is that a lot of the creators crafted a contradiction within their content.

09:12.900 --> 09:17.700
They wanted to be this boy slash girl next door who was looking out for you while living in a mansion

09:17.700 --> 09:23.900
and selling merchandise at rather extortionate prices, exploiting the consumer while telling them they cared about them.

09:23.900 --> 09:27.900
I don't think living a wealthy life means selling out your core appeal necessarily,

09:27.900 --> 09:33.100
but I think the problem was they were trying to emulate this persona that these circumstances no longer supported,

09:33.100 --> 09:35.300
and therefore a lot of them felt forced.

09:35.300 --> 09:40.900
So what has happened? Well, vlogging has appeared to go the way of the anti-hero of recent.

09:40.900 --> 09:46.300
We don't want people who try to be perfect human beings and transcend us with their wonderful advice,

09:46.300 --> 09:51.300
because at the end of the day, none of us are perfect, and given the sheer misery in the last couple years,

09:51.300 --> 09:55.100
we don't want unconditionally happy people. Those days are gone.

09:55.100 --> 10:01.100
Come of the hour, come of the obnoxious, inappropriate, but still somewhat redeemable characters.

10:01.100 --> 10:04.500
We were looking for an edge, and that transformation was coming gradually.

10:04.500 --> 10:09.500
People seemed increasingly desperate for a defining feature rather than just the fact that they were friends,

10:09.500 --> 10:13.900
and they existed, and they did challenges. This was a new energy to a lot of styles.

10:13.900 --> 10:15.700
Compare the past popular vlogger,

10:15.700 --> 10:20.700
And my new boots. These are from Russell and Bromley,

10:20.700 --> 10:30.900
and they are perfect for rainy, cold days where you've got to stretch around town getting all the last minute presents.

10:30.900 --> 10:35.900
You're going to stay here. You look so tiny compared to that unit.

10:35.900 --> 10:37.900
Right, we can jump in the car and make our way into town.

10:37.900 --> 10:42.500
We've got the radio tunes on. Heart Extra X-mas.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.500
To a present popular vlogger.

10:44.500 --> 10:47.900
I've been cooped up, bro. With so much work.

10:47.900 --> 10:48.900
I just want to go out and do best.

10:48.900 --> 10:49.900
Let's go do best.

10:49.900 --> 10:50.900
Past.

10:50.900 --> 10:55.300
Well, this video today that we're filming for my main, my Pointless Vlog channel,

10:55.300 --> 10:58.300
this is going to be a super interesting video.

10:58.300 --> 11:02.300
Like, I'm super, super interested in the topic. I'm really, really excited to get talking about it.

11:02.300 --> 11:03.300
Present.

11:03.300 --> 11:05.300
Isn't it surprising his nanny with $10,000 today?

11:05.300 --> 11:07.300
Why?

11:07.300 --> 11:09.300
Vlogmas is a bitch.

11:09.300 --> 11:11.300
Fuck, we don't have any video today?

11:11.300 --> 11:13.300
Oh, this is great.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.300
Take it! Take it! Take it! Take it!

11:15.300 --> 11:17.300
Hey, mailman.

11:17.300 --> 11:19.300
How would you like 10 grand?

11:19.300 --> 11:24.300
Also, this kind of explains why a lot of the older vloggers were British and the newer ones are American.

11:24.300 --> 11:27.300
I mean, can you see Zoella being that loud and out there?

11:27.300 --> 11:28.300
I'm just saying.

11:28.300 --> 11:31.300
I feel like this has been happening over the last few years with these new vloggers.

11:31.300 --> 11:36.300
The reason I'm saying this is because I think some people see Chamberlain as a dramatic shift

11:36.300 --> 11:40.300
but I much more see her as a completion of a very interesting cycle

11:40.300 --> 11:43.300
to finally expel the previous generation of vloggers

11:43.300 --> 11:47.300
who themselves were viewed as these rather softly elitist bunch of creators

11:47.300 --> 11:50.300
who enabled a facade when the truth was much different

11:50.300 --> 11:53.300
and whereas other new vloggers have certainly challenged that

11:53.300 --> 11:56.300
there is still an element of superficiality

11:56.300 --> 11:59.300
and that's what changes with Emma Chamberlain.

12:07.300 --> 12:12.300
So with this video I decided to undertake a lot of research into Emma's content, past and present

12:12.300 --> 12:15.300
to understand what really makes her so bloody special.

12:15.300 --> 12:18.300
When she started she appeared to do these sorts of travel vlogs

12:18.300 --> 12:20.300
which didn't really take off as content

12:20.300 --> 12:23.300
but definitely set up some of her very idiosyncratic traits.

12:23.300 --> 12:26.300
That means basically traits that are identifiable to yourself.

12:33.300 --> 12:37.300
You see, at first her videos were rooted in the very traditional vlog formula

12:37.300 --> 12:41.300
the very Casey Neistat style idea.

12:41.300 --> 12:44.300
What you do is what shapes the vlogs and makes them interesting

12:44.300 --> 12:47.300
and someone like Neistat does really capture that

12:47.300 --> 12:49.300
but it didn't really work for her

12:49.300 --> 12:52.300
maybe because as a smaller YouTuber you can't quite capture

12:52.300 --> 12:55.300
the sheer grandiosity of a life like Neistat's

12:55.300 --> 12:59.300
and you're competing with people who have so many more resources than yourself.

12:59.300 --> 13:04.300
What appeared to change was when she dipped into actually a more commentary oriented style

13:04.300 --> 13:07.300
with videos such as We Owe The Dollar Store An Apology

13:07.300 --> 13:09.300
and her first day of school vlog.

13:09.300 --> 13:12.300
As you see, here's what Zoella had to say about school.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.300
No, actually I want to learn this today

13:22.300 --> 13:25.300
or no, I'm going to really concentrate on what my teacher is saying to me right now

13:25.300 --> 13:28.300
because I don't want you distracting me.

13:28.300 --> 13:32.300
Don't stay up all night watching YouTube videos.

13:32.300 --> 13:36.300
And Emma Chamberlain had some very different words of wisdom.

13:36.300 --> 13:41.300
I have to go back to the one place that sucks out all of the happiness out of my life

13:41.300 --> 13:42.300
and that is school.

13:42.300 --> 13:44.300
Nothing about this situation excites me.

13:44.300 --> 13:46.300
Nothing about that makes me want to smile.

13:47.300 --> 13:50.300
If I try to vlog at school I'm probably going to get my phone taken away.

13:50.300 --> 13:53.300
But you know what? I don't even care because YouTube is life

13:53.300 --> 13:57.300
and YouTube is better than school so I prioritise this over school.

13:57.300 --> 14:01.300
Watching the videos I received the idea that Zoella has this sort of same impression

14:01.300 --> 14:03.300
of school that Emma Chamberlain does

14:03.300 --> 14:06.300
and if they were to sit down and discuss what they don't like about school they'd probably agree.

14:06.300 --> 14:09.300
The difference is that Emma Chamberlain doesn't sugar coat her words.

14:09.300 --> 14:12.300
She doesn't talk down to the audience like she's been there.

14:12.300 --> 14:14.300
She just says she absolutely loathes school

14:14.300 --> 14:18.300
and although the brave face argument may serve as somewhat better advice on Zoella's part

14:18.300 --> 14:24.300
people still have that voice in their head that represents the unfiltered judgemental critical nihilistic view

14:24.300 --> 14:28.300
that Emma Chamberlain was never afraid to hold back on and deliver with the most brute honesty.

14:28.300 --> 14:33.300
A famous Freudian theory documents that of the id, the ego, and the superego

14:33.300 --> 14:36.300
represented on this little diagram here.

14:36.300 --> 14:41.300
Now generally I don't rate Freud too much as a guy who provided decent amounts of evidence

14:41.300 --> 14:45.300
and this idea I think is very reductionist of how the human mind works.

14:45.300 --> 14:51.300
It's not that simple to categorise, however it does somewhat represent the conflict that many of us have.

14:51.300 --> 14:55.300
The id is typically seen as what represents our more self-centred desires

14:55.300 --> 14:58.300
and we typically internalise that, but it still exists.

14:58.300 --> 15:03.300
Whereas the ego is the more reasonable side and the superego is the very selfless aspect.

15:03.300 --> 15:08.300
Emma seems to have taken this formula and just shoved the ego and superego out the window

15:08.300 --> 15:12.300
and left us with this rather straightforward depiction of a pissed off teenager

15:12.300 --> 15:16.300
who has to go to a shitty school and learn things that she'll never have to apply.

15:16.300 --> 15:19.300
No one really wants to admit it, but she does really relate to them.

15:19.300 --> 15:23.300
But Chamberlain's success doesn't stop there, there is a nuance to it,

15:23.300 --> 15:25.300
and that's where we talk about the delivery.

15:25.300 --> 15:28.300
In her first Q&A Emma is asked about her inspirations,

15:28.300 --> 15:32.300
she lists Neistat which can be particularly represented in her early vlogs

15:32.300 --> 15:36.300
and then Cody Ko who is obviously quite a different style of creator.

15:37.300 --> 15:44.300
However, what I found even more interesting is the fact that her favourite show was The Office

15:44.300 --> 15:46.300
which once again, a great comedy.

15:46.300 --> 15:51.300
But she also said her favourite character was Dwight who represents that more cynical creation,

15:51.300 --> 15:56.300
although his love for the system is probably running counter to Chamberlain's express hatred for it.

15:56.300 --> 15:59.300
She's clearly been very much in touch with the YouTube atmosphere,

15:59.300 --> 16:01.300
she says she's been watching it forever,

16:01.300 --> 16:06.300
and on top of that her knowledge of comedy and commentary definitely shines through in the best of her content,

16:06.300 --> 16:11.300
particularly in the edits which capture an energy probably even stronger than her favourites like Cody Ko.

16:11.300 --> 16:15.300
So with all this in mind, what I find very smart about Emma Chamberlain's style

16:15.300 --> 16:19.300
is that she basically wrapped what could have been rather obnoxious entitled rants

16:19.300 --> 16:23.300
in a seething tone that seemed to undermine that negativity,

16:23.300 --> 16:27.300
and when she did go on rants it felt somewhat justified and relatable to an audience,

16:27.300 --> 16:28.300
such as her school rants.

16:28.300 --> 16:32.300
She followed this school rant with a discussion about her school uniform,

16:32.300 --> 16:36.300
and this could have been rather innocuous and not the sort of thing that would create any tonal variety

16:36.300 --> 16:38.300
following on from her rant about school,

16:38.300 --> 16:42.300
but she changes it up, and sarcastically mocks how rigid school uniforms are

16:42.300 --> 16:45.300
by presenting them like some sort of frock for a fashion show.

16:45.300 --> 16:49.300
Emma Chamberlain- You can see we have the nice quarter zip looking thing we have here,

16:49.300 --> 16:55.300
nice very trendy pleated skirt, because you know pleated skirts are so in this season,

16:55.300 --> 17:00.300
Vans socks, super trendy and cute, and some white Vans.

17:00.300 --> 17:03.300
I like this, I think this is pretty damn good content,

17:03.300 --> 17:07.300
and much more refreshing than a lot of previous creators who I could never relate to,

17:07.300 --> 17:11.300
but Chamberlain appeals to the inner cynic, the inner nihilist, hell the inner hedonist,

17:11.300 --> 17:14.300
and when she was in that situation that many people were in,

17:14.300 --> 17:19.300
and evoked a much more honest reaction than many people really have the balls to do,

17:19.300 --> 17:23.300
it was cathartic for viewers in a way to have someone to just be able to go off like that.

17:23.300 --> 17:27.300
Chamberlain represented the vlogger that people didn't have to aspire to be,

17:27.300 --> 17:29.300
because they already were.

17:29.300 --> 17:33.300
The brand anti-vlogger I feel isn't quite right, I feel kinda differently,

17:33.300 --> 17:37.300
she just represented a vlogger that even in her arguably imperfect state,

17:37.300 --> 17:41.300
people could trust, people knew that what they saw was what she felt,

17:41.300 --> 17:45.300
and that's overwhelming in a genre that is derided by many as fake

17:45.300 --> 17:48.300
and creating this unreal idea of people's lives.

17:48.300 --> 17:50.300
Let me bring this back to commentary then,

17:50.300 --> 17:54.300
one of the greatest criticisms that we had of vloggers was that they were disingenuous

17:54.300 --> 17:58.300
and were acting like they had all this love for their viewers when this wasn't the case

17:58.300 --> 18:00.300
and they were clearly out to benefit themselves.

18:00.300 --> 18:04.300
Chamberlain skips the middleman and doesn't deceive her viewers with what she cares about,

18:04.300 --> 18:08.300
this allows her to undermine the usual criticism that she is feigning

18:08.300 --> 18:11.300
an excessive amount of interest for the audience's wellbeing

18:11.300 --> 18:17.300
because to actually make that claim there first needs to exist an excessive amount of interest for the audience's wellbeing.

18:17.300 --> 18:20.300
And so like anyone who was some exceeding quality,

18:20.300 --> 18:23.300
which she definitely demonstrated, her content blew up,

18:23.300 --> 18:27.300
and people tuned in from it, she seemed to represent that middle finger to the previous generations,

18:27.300 --> 18:31.300
if you've ever watched the honest translations of politicians and such,

18:31.300 --> 18:36.300
that's how I see Emma Chamberlain, however with the blow up came incredible success,

18:36.300 --> 18:40.300
which appeared to threaten the very foundations that she had constructed her platform on.

18:40.300 --> 18:42.300
So let's talk about that.

18:48.300 --> 18:53.300
Emma Chamberlain's growth came incredibly fast,

18:53.300 --> 18:57.300
and with her rather admirable work ethic and the consistency of her content,

18:57.300 --> 19:00.300
meant that it just created this huge snowball effect that keeps on rolling,

19:00.300 --> 19:03.300
however when you acquire such a reputation,

19:03.300 --> 19:08.300
one of the things that many people will advise you to do is move to a city which is considered an entertainment hub.

19:08.300 --> 19:12.300
The reason this is, is because although you can film a YouTube video anywhere,

19:12.300 --> 19:15.300
there are many more opportunities that YouTube can launch,

19:15.300 --> 19:17.300
which can only be fully realised by going places,

19:17.300 --> 19:21.300
and the obvious choice for those in the media industry is Los Angeles, California.

19:21.300 --> 19:26.300
Another big reason to do this is because you normally enter deals, partnerships, sponsorships,

19:26.300 --> 19:29.300
you know, this is how the modern creator makes the real bucks,

19:29.300 --> 19:32.300
YouTube is an unreliable method of income,

19:32.300 --> 19:34.300
there are many more sources that provide stability,

19:34.300 --> 19:37.300
and like anyone, Emma decided to pursue those.

19:37.300 --> 19:40.300
One of those was the ever reliable YouTuber merchandise,

19:40.300 --> 19:44.300
many creators, large and small, have generated a lot of additional profit for themselves,

19:44.300 --> 19:48.300
through the trusty commodities that they can flog to their audiences,

19:48.300 --> 19:51.300
but you see, this time there was a different, more creative idea,

19:51.300 --> 19:53.300
you see Emma, or more likely her agents,

19:53.300 --> 19:57.300
decided that it would be an interesting business move to pixelate the merch,

19:57.300 --> 20:00.300
I assume to create some sort of aura of mystery,

20:00.300 --> 20:04.300
but it didn't quite work, it more generated an aura of outrage,

20:04.300 --> 20:10.300
because whoever was in charge of this probably was not quite in tabs with the standards that YouTube audiences set,

20:10.300 --> 20:13.300
they want their merch affordable, and they want to be able to see it as well.

20:13.300 --> 20:16.300
If this was done for some kind of upper class clothing brand,

20:16.300 --> 20:20.300
it may have been lauded by critics as an avant-garde move,

20:20.300 --> 20:22.300
but no, people just want it straight to the point,

20:22.300 --> 20:26.300
there was also a suspicious resemblance to AliExpress merchandise,

20:26.300 --> 20:28.300
once the presentation was actually revealed,

20:28.300 --> 20:31.300
this caused further furor, and she did address this in a response,

20:31.300 --> 20:34.300
in which she gave some rather erratic explanation.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.300
Oh, back to what we were talking about,

20:36.300 --> 20:38.300
somebody said that my clothing line's really expensive,

20:38.300 --> 20:41.300
I'd like to say that I didn't come up with the prices for my clothing line,

20:41.300 --> 20:44.300
yes, it's technically mine, I guess, but not really,

20:44.300 --> 20:47.300
because all I did was design the clothes, and half of it, yeah,

20:47.300 --> 20:50.300
so like, it's not really up to me, those things,

20:50.300 --> 20:53.300
and honestly, I agree, I think it's really, really expensive,

20:53.300 --> 20:57.300
and honestly, I would be a little bit triggered too.

20:57.300 --> 21:00.300
And surprise, surprise, this didn't appease the masses either,

21:00.300 --> 21:03.300
after all, she has to anticipate, to an extent,

21:03.300 --> 21:07.300
that merchandise with her name will delegate her some responsibility,

21:07.300 --> 21:10.300
it is an implicit endorsement of the prices regardless,

21:10.300 --> 21:13.300
and that means having more foresight when you enter these deals,

21:13.300 --> 21:15.300
and as I said in my Smosh video,

21:15.300 --> 21:18.300
that's what makes businesses so dangerous in their influence,

21:18.300 --> 21:20.300
you're the person who's gonna suffer the flack,

21:20.300 --> 21:23.300
and when responding to such criticism, you have to keep that in mind,

21:23.300 --> 21:26.300
this incident in particular really galvanised the narrative

21:26.300 --> 21:28.300
that she had kind of sold out,

21:28.300 --> 21:32.300
that she was essentially becoming everything that she had previously mocked and criticised,

21:32.300 --> 21:35.300
which was supposedly illuminated by moments like these.

21:36.300 --> 21:39.300
I've been seeing this shirt on Pinterest, I'll insert some pictures.

21:43.300 --> 21:46.300
So, this shirt, $450.

21:48.300 --> 21:52.300
I just, there's no way I could do this, I can't just buy a $450 shirt,

21:52.300 --> 21:55.300
I'm not a celebrity, and I'm not loaded, so.

21:55.300 --> 21:56.300
First we're going to Gucci.

21:56.300 --> 21:57.300
We have to go to Gucci first.

21:57.300 --> 21:59.300
We have to get you a Gucci belt, a good and fast gucky belt.

21:59.300 --> 22:02.300
They're literally making me go to Gucci and spend like $400 on a Gucci belt.

22:03.300 --> 22:04.300
No, yeah, but.

22:06.300 --> 22:08.300
I'm feeling like a real big fat b**** right now.

22:08.300 --> 22:10.300
Yeah, I feel like a douchebag every day carrying this around.

22:10.300 --> 22:11.300
Yeah.

22:11.300 --> 22:12.300
Wait, I have to.

22:12.300 --> 22:13.300
First I got these socks.

22:13.300 --> 22:14.300
I got a Gucci fanny pack.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.300
No, Grayson, Grayson, you're nuts.

22:16.300 --> 22:17.300
Just show yours that we're going one at a time.

22:17.300 --> 22:19.300
I got my Gucci slide.

22:19.300 --> 22:21.300
Then after that I'm gonna go thrifting for a little bit

22:21.300 --> 22:23.300
because I need to do some hardcore thrifting,

22:23.300 --> 22:24.300
I haven't thrifted in a very long time.

22:24.300 --> 22:27.300
When I go thrifting, I don't feel bad about buying new things

22:27.300 --> 22:30.300
because thrifting is so cheap, so it's not even an issue.

22:30.300 --> 22:33.300
The other day, I was walking around Melrose in LA.

22:33.300 --> 22:36.300
There's a lot of cool vintage stores and they're all overpriced but whatever.

22:36.300 --> 22:38.300
I had narrowed it down to 20, but I was like,

22:38.300 --> 22:42.300
this is going to be at least $2,000 if I buy all these jeans,

22:42.300 --> 22:45.300
meaning that I have to narrow it down a little bit more well.

22:45.300 --> 22:47.300
And I spent f****** dollars on jeans,

22:47.300 --> 22:51.300
but the thing is, is that I've never been happier to do something in my life.

22:51.300 --> 22:53.300
I was thrilled to give her all my money.

22:53.300 --> 22:55.300
Further to this, like the community does,

22:55.300 --> 22:57.300
there were a load more allegations dealt out.

22:57.300 --> 23:00.300
Some to do with bullying, insensitive tweets,

23:00.300 --> 23:02.300
and also a very bizarre one about blackface,

23:02.300 --> 23:05.300
which is clearly just some fairly cheap makeup.

23:05.300 --> 23:06.300
I mean, it was from the dollar store.

23:06.300 --> 23:09.300
And what had occurred was the classic slippery slope of criticism.

23:09.300 --> 23:12.300
As soon as one vaguely reasonable criticism came out against her,

23:12.300 --> 23:15.300
a load more followed, each more ridiculous than the last.

23:15.300 --> 23:17.300
However, we're going to set those aside and say,

23:17.300 --> 23:20.300
in my opinion, I think most of them are fairly unfounded,

23:20.300 --> 23:22.300
and without further evidence, and clear evidence at least,

23:22.300 --> 23:24.300
it's hard to buy into them.

23:24.300 --> 23:26.300
So I want to discuss the greater narrative itself.

23:26.300 --> 23:28.300
That she as a person has changed.

23:28.300 --> 23:31.300
Which, you know, looking at what we do have is a credible theory.

23:31.300 --> 23:35.300
But the thing is, in spite of the criticism that I think can be levied against her,

23:35.300 --> 23:37.300
with regards to her personality,

23:37.300 --> 23:40.300
I honestly don't think she herself ever changed that much.

23:40.300 --> 23:42.300
I think if you look at her old content,

23:42.300 --> 23:45.300
that cynicism, that attitude, is still there.

23:45.300 --> 23:47.300
In fact, the whole situation, in my opinion,

23:47.300 --> 23:50.300
exposes how the only thing that changes is the circumstance

23:50.300 --> 23:53.300
which altered the interpretation of her content.

23:53.300 --> 23:55.300
Chamberlain was never your happy girl next door,

23:55.300 --> 23:57.300
she wasn't a bad person per se,

23:57.300 --> 24:02.300
but her brand was on the basis of being rather brutal and open in her pursuits for success.

24:02.300 --> 24:05.300
Therefore, a lot of her attitude can be explained by that.

24:05.300 --> 24:07.300
She didn't wear Gucci because she wasn't quote famous,

24:07.300 --> 24:10.300
and now she is famous, well she's gonna wear Gucci.

24:10.300 --> 24:14.300
I mean, she was a stingy lass who wouldn't even shell out on Spotify Premium,

24:14.300 --> 24:16.300
and now she's probably turning in the racks.

24:16.300 --> 24:18.300
She's probably got a Tidal account too,

24:18.300 --> 24:21.300
which, no, isn't the most advisable thing regardless, but still.

24:21.300 --> 24:24.300
At the end of the day, the people who put someone like Emma Chamberlain on a podium

24:24.300 --> 24:27.300
can't be surprised in a way at these consequences.

24:27.300 --> 24:30.300
I think many people had Emma viewed as this sort of populist vlogger

24:30.300 --> 24:34.300
who represented that movement against the establishment of previous vloggers.

24:34.300 --> 24:37.300
However, what I think she often represented was herself,

24:37.300 --> 24:40.300
and because she was living a fairly regular life at that point,

24:40.300 --> 24:44.300
that on the basis of itself tended to resonate with a lot of viewers

24:44.300 --> 24:46.300
who also had their own concerns,

24:46.300 --> 24:49.300
and now she's part of the industry and the circumstances have changed,

24:49.300 --> 24:53.300
she still has those principles, they're just not as relatable.

24:53.300 --> 24:57.300
She always came across as a rather amoral person on these issues.

24:57.300 --> 25:01.300
But buying gifts is so stressful, every single year I have a very tough time buying gifts for people

25:01.300 --> 25:03.300
because number one, I don't want to spend money on anyone.

25:03.300 --> 25:07.300
That's the thing, she hasn't changed, it's just her circumstances that have.

25:07.300 --> 25:09.300
And because Emma is no longer going to school,

25:09.300 --> 25:12.300
because she's no longer doing the things that normal people do,

25:12.300 --> 25:14.300
she loses that factor of being that person.

25:14.300 --> 25:19.300
However, on the other hand, I still think she's retained a lot of these key commentary components.

25:19.300 --> 25:22.300
One of her newest videos was very similar in tone to the older ones.

25:22.300 --> 25:26.300
The only thing I'd say is that the editing is becoming more overbearing than her old stuff,

25:26.300 --> 25:30.300
and although it's definitely welcome, it's sometimes a bit too much.

25:32.300 --> 25:33.300
Let's just get right into it.

25:39.300 --> 25:40.300
Let's get started.

25:40.300 --> 25:42.300
Emma Chamberlain has become rich and famous,

25:42.300 --> 25:46.300
and there will be some people that will probably not be able to relate to that

25:46.300 --> 25:48.300
in the way that they related to Emma's old content.

25:48.300 --> 25:53.300
However, it was a compromise Emma clearly felt was necessary to provide her with some longevity

25:53.300 --> 25:55.300
in the case that YouTube falls through,

25:55.300 --> 25:59.300
and she has to provide that progression that many people do look for.

25:59.300 --> 26:03.300
She had this opportunity to go out and live her dreams with people like the Dolan twins,

26:03.300 --> 26:07.300
and she's gonna go and do that, even if it's not my idea of the dream.

26:07.300 --> 26:12.300
Equally, another issue is that her changing circumstances can often mean that she can't behave the same.

26:12.300 --> 26:15.300
She always had that slightly smarmy attitude,

26:15.300 --> 26:18.300
but now that she's successful, it can come across rather differently,

26:18.300 --> 26:20.300
such as when she accepted the Streamy Award.

26:30.300 --> 26:34.300
As a larger creator, you can't make a moment like that kind of awkward and sarcastic,

26:34.300 --> 26:37.300
or else it just feels inherently condescending to the audience,

26:37.300 --> 26:40.300
and extremely, extremely awkward.

26:40.300 --> 26:43.300
And once again, I feel like as a person, she hasn't changed,

26:43.300 --> 26:45.300
and that may be part of the problem,

26:45.300 --> 26:49.300
because although I feel she should definitely retain a grip on those traits that make her content appealing,

26:49.300 --> 26:51.300
if you want to stay in touch with your audience,

26:51.300 --> 26:54.300
you have to be somewhat respondent to your changing relationship with them,

26:54.300 --> 26:57.300
and the responsibility that that ensues.

26:57.300 --> 27:02.300
With that said, she has no obligation to, and as it stands, she is relatively successful,

27:02.300 --> 27:06.300
and although backlash is inevitable, I don't think it's significant enough to faze her,

27:06.300 --> 27:08.300
and she still has a lot of appealing elements.

27:08.300 --> 27:12.300
The question of this video then, was one that yielded from a lot of videos that I'd watched on her,

27:12.300 --> 27:14.300
with those labels, and how she's changed.

27:14.300 --> 27:17.300
Did she become everything she hated?

27:17.300 --> 27:19.300
And I think the fallacy lies within the question in a way,

27:19.300 --> 27:24.300
because I don't think Emma ever hated the opportunism of her previous generation,

27:24.300 --> 27:27.300
she just never tried to cover it up in any other way necessarily,

27:27.300 --> 27:30.300
other than the way it affected her as a person,

27:30.300 --> 27:36.300
and at the start, she never had the opportunities that those previous generation style vloggers had.

27:36.300 --> 27:40.300
However, her style did bring a refreshing take to those who wanted something more believable,

27:40.300 --> 27:44.300
and that overlapped into the conflicts of interest we're witnessing today,

27:44.300 --> 27:49.300
because those opportunities came, and she took them and did what many other vloggers have already done,

27:49.300 --> 27:51.300
and she never claimed to be against that.

27:51.300 --> 27:55.300
I understood that many people may argue that the fame has gone to her head,

27:55.300 --> 27:59.300
but I think it's more the fame has changed her lifestyle in a way that differentiates it

27:59.300 --> 28:02.300
from what made it relatable in the first place for some viewers,

28:02.300 --> 28:04.300
and thus affecting the relationship.

28:04.300 --> 28:08.300
I think that's irreconcilable in a way, because seeing someone whine about school

28:08.300 --> 28:11.300
is different to seeing someone whine about something you can't relate to,

28:11.300 --> 28:16.300
particularly in relativity to your state, seeing rich people complain is never fun.

28:16.300 --> 28:20.300
With that said, she has mostly avoided as coming across as too petty,

28:20.300 --> 28:22.300
and she's still doing well with audience reception,

28:22.300 --> 28:25.300
and so in that instance, I have to give credit to her.

28:25.300 --> 28:27.300
She's definitely slipped up from time to time,

28:27.300 --> 28:31.300
but as someone who is 17 who has blown up so incredibly quickly,

28:31.300 --> 28:33.300
I think she is handling it rather well.

28:33.300 --> 28:36.300
The story of Emma Chamberlain is one that is rather interesting,

28:36.300 --> 28:40.300
because she is a significant character in the recent evolution of blogging,

28:40.300 --> 28:42.300
definitely representing a very new attitude.

28:42.300 --> 28:46.300
At the same time, it seems that people wanted to associate that new attitude

28:46.300 --> 28:48.300
with a more grassroots mentality,

28:48.300 --> 28:51.300
when really I think she was just expressing her own interests,

28:51.300 --> 28:54.300
and her problems, and then the people related,

28:54.300 --> 28:56.300
and now those interests and those problems are different,

28:56.300 --> 28:58.300
and people no longer relate.

28:58.300 --> 29:00.300
Does that interfere with her content for some viewers?

29:00.300 --> 29:04.300
Sure, but there are still a lot of people who find appeal within her delivery

29:04.300 --> 29:06.300
and her style which is still unique,

29:06.300 --> 29:08.300
and her rather savage nature,

29:08.300 --> 29:12.300
which is something that I think can overshadow any consistencies with her past self.

29:12.300 --> 29:14.300
Whether her new brand will prevail,

29:14.300 --> 29:16.300
well, I guess we'll have to wait and see.

29:20.300 --> 29:22.300
So, there was the video,

29:22.300 --> 29:24.300
another great one, I hope you enjoyed.

29:24.300 --> 29:27.300
I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comment section below

29:27.300 --> 29:29.300
about what you think about Emma Chamberlain.

29:29.300 --> 29:31.300
Has she become everything she used to mock,

29:31.300 --> 29:33.300
or do you think there's been very little change?

29:33.300 --> 29:38.300
On top of this, I'd like to thank all my editors who have once again done a fantastic job.

29:38.300 --> 29:41.300
I would also like to give a special thanks to some of my Patreons

29:41.300 --> 29:43.300
who are up there on the screen now,

29:43.300 --> 29:47.300
and a special thanks to Ryan who is still very generously donating $100.

29:47.300 --> 29:51.300
I'm honestly very flattered that he thinks I'm worth $100.

29:51.300 --> 29:53.300
That's not what they thought in the brothels.

29:53.300 --> 29:56.300
To add an extra bit in here, I also have to give a shoutout to Connor

29:56.300 --> 29:58.300
who is my recent new $50 Patreon,

29:58.300 --> 30:00.300
and I really appreciate it.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.300
My throat is dying from illness right now,

30:02.300 --> 30:04.300
but I hope this can serve as a little thank you.

30:04.300 --> 30:06.300
Before I get a bit too edgy with my humour,

30:06.300 --> 30:09.300
you know, the right opinions, feeling a bit mental today,

30:09.300 --> 30:13.300
if you want to message me, you can follow me on Twitter, Facebook,

30:13.300 --> 30:16.300
anywhere you want to reach me, get in touch with me,

30:16.300 --> 30:18.300
I'm out there in the world.

30:18.300 --> 30:21.300
You can join my Discord, that's a great place with some great people.

30:21.300 --> 30:23.300
I don't think there's too much else to say, so,

30:23.300 --> 30:25.300
to conclude, I am the right opinion,

30:25.300 --> 30:27.300
and I will see you in the next one.

30:27.300 --> 30:30.300
There in your ears

30:30.300 --> 30:33.300
There in your ears

30:33.300 --> 30:37.300
There in your ears

30:37.300 --> 30:39.300
But still there is

30:39.300 --> 30:42.300
There in your ears

30:42.300 --> 30:45.300
There in your ears

30:45.300 --> 30:48.300
There in your ears
