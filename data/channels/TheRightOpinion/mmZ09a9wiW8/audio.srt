00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
An interesting topic.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,200
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,400
And gaming, something that has undoubtedly become popularized in the last couple decades.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,700
I see an evolution. I see it in my own family.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,900
When I was growing up, I had some exposure to video games, but not too much,

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,700
as its accessibility wasn't huge when I was a younger lad,

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,600
and there wasn't really a gadget-focused culture until I was around 13 or 14,

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,500
which I then kind of rejected anyway.

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,600
I wasn't the biggest on phones or such, I had a brick, basically.

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,300
It wasn't the most competitive thing, and it wasn't prevalent in culture.

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,700
To have an impressive iPhone or iPad at a young age was a privilege.

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,700
Nowadays, within the society that I'm in, it's almost a deprivation not to have one.

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,200
Online and offline games have become infinitely more compatible with daily life,

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,800
and many revolutionary accessories have been released, retaining many gamers,

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,100
and increasing the younger demographic in particular.

16
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,400
Comparatively, my brother spends insane amounts of time on video games.

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,500
Even though I was a fairly passionate, avid gamer at his age,

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,100
there wasn't such a motivation to play said games.

19
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,000
Apparently, I'm not the only one who has noted a technological shift in the industry,

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,900
with the World Health Organization, abbreviated to the WHO, also recently picking up on it.

21
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,200
Now, the WHO, as they would be expected to, have a set of guidelines and classifications for diseases,

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,500
aptly named the International Classifications of Diseases, also abbreviated to ICD.

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,100
They're quite a verbose organization, and in a way, they have to be.

24
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,400
Now, given the evolving times, the ICD has to respectively evolve their classifications.

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,200
Their most recent revision, ICD-11, is in the works.

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,300
It is currently sat at a beta draft stage, to my understanding.

27
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:37,500
However, one inclusion that has raised a few eyebrows was the involvement of what they decided to name the gaming disorder.

28
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,000
On the website, it's located in the mental, developmental, and neurodevelopmental disorders section,

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
on the dropdown box from disorders due to addictive behaviors,

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
sat comfortably below the gambling disorder.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,500
Now, if you're a casual gamer like many, this will not affect you.

32
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,300
In fact, it almost certainly won't affect you.

33
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,800
So what do people take issue with?

34
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,000
Well, I think it's the fact that an addictive personality could affect participation in any hobbies.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,200
So what is people's problem if it really doesn't affect too many individuals?

36
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,400
Well, I think it's the legitimate point that it comes from the addictive personality.

37
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,400
I think people's point is that an addictive personality could affect participation in any hobbies, and that is true.

38
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,100
Why isn't there a tennis disorder, for example, for people who play too much tennis?

39
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,400
Firstly, I assume that other addictions, like the exemplary tennis disorder, would be covered under the other section,

40
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,000
but gaming probably has its own disorder now, not because there's anything unique about gaming as a concept,

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,600
but most probably because of the disproportionate amount of people, possibly in East Asian countries in particular,

42
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,400
who have really adopted a very fervent gaming culture.

43
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,600
In South Korea, for example, they even have laws preventing children under 16 from playing video games from 10pm to 6am

44
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,000
due to a number of gaming-related incidents,

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,100
as well as investing money into clinics and services to help combat what could be perceived as an epidemic.

46
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,400
So definitely, in some places, this distinction can be justified.

47
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,700
It's important to note that a disorder takes prevalence when it inhibits your ability to function in your daily life,

48
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,700
and the WHO do take note of that.

49
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,500
Once again, their definitions do have a generalised ability.

50
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,100
We've all probably done things before that have been a detriment to our health in hindsight,

51
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,200
but we did it anyway with the hope of some reward.

52
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,900
There's nothing exceptional about gaming from that perspective.

53
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,700
Gambling, to an extent, is a bit more distinctive as it involves monetary suffering.

54
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,300
There is a clear difference in investment, and the WHO have done a bit of a half-copy-paste job,

55
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,600
and the equivalence obviously isn't quite there yet.

56
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,400
Maybe they'll clean that up after the draft.

57
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,500
But the clarification that it does impair functions in daily life is an important component and that is emphasised,

58
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,100
so there is no discrediting them there.

59
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,900
Obviously, most things taken in excess will have some sort of implication,

60
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,900
but the WHO clearly believe there is some sort of exclusivity within gaming,

61
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,000
and to an extent, there is.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,600
It's definitely a more immediate yet sedentary hobby, and it has its appeals.

63
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,800
However, I think one point that must be stressed is that it's not necessarily on the game for the disorder.

64
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,500
As the subdivision states, the main cause of this is an addictive personality,

65
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,500
which subsequently makes us question whether a gaming addiction is really a disorder in itself,

66
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,900
or just a symptom of an addictive personality.

67
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,400
On top of that, if we're placing gaming in the same group of age-restricted genres,

68
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,200
such as gambling and alcohol consumption, what implications does that have?

69
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,200
I think most people's problem is the slippery slope, that if this is affirmed as a disorder,

70
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,100
then it could be manipulated for a political agenda against gaming.

71
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,400
It's not impossible, there have always been moments by politicians who see gaming as this malevolent fiend that must be spited,

72
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,200
particularly those who tend to reference single-edged studies on a very double-edged sword.

73
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,400
In a way, this would open up many opportunities for new restrictions,

74
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,700
and that's obviously not what the WHO are dictating here.

75
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,700
And although certain individuals have accused the WHO of corruption,

76
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,100
they can't refrain from classification just because other individuals may manipulate it.

77
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,600
That would be on the public to call them out if they were behaving in such a way.

78
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,800
Whether the public would or not is another question.

79
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,400
It's a rather ambiguous debate.

80
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,500
Some parents would simply lavish the concept that they can pull out the gaming disorder against their belligerent child,

81
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,200
while others are far too impartial to even give a shit.

82
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:51,000
Not to mention that in a lot of Western countries, the authorities don't have their crusty claws in the regular household to the extent that I'm sure they'd love to.

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,600
And the law is quite lenient.

84
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,000
I mean, if you're a child, you could still be a homeschooled alcoholic in the UK, you're allowed to drink at five years old.

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,300
It's an interesting fact nugget, but there you have it.

86
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,100
So I highly doubt this will have too many implications, given the fact that gaming is mostly private,

87
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,800
and that the government can't really do too much without upsetting some businesses.

88
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,200
Maybe a possible sanction on public institutions like schools, maybe.

89
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,300
But then again, that's not gonna kill off too much, and school doesn't necessarily rely on gaming.

90
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,600
I'd hope at least, though, you know, times might have changed that much.

91
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,700
Either way, the gaming disorder is not to be confused with gaming, nor should gaming be confused as the cause.

92
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,200
It should not be reason to panic.

93
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,600
Your life will go on as many, I assume.

94
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,400
Although technicalities do make this incorporation somewhat questionable, that's how it's gonna be.

95
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,900
Anyway, I would love to hear your thoughts on the topic, it's certainly a curious one.

96
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,300
And until the next one, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you then.
