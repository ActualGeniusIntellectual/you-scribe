0	1500	An interesting topic.
7500	11200	Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
11200	15400	And gaming, something that has undoubtedly become popularized in the last couple decades.
15400	17700	I see an evolution. I see it in my own family.
17700	20900	When I was growing up, I had some exposure to video games, but not too much,
20900	23700	as its accessibility wasn't huge when I was a younger lad,
23700	27600	and there wasn't really a gadget-focused culture until I was around 13 or 14,
27600	29500	which I then kind of rejected anyway.
29500	32600	I wasn't the biggest on phones or such, I had a brick, basically.
32600	35300	It wasn't the most competitive thing, and it wasn't prevalent in culture.
35300	38700	To have an impressive iPhone or iPad at a young age was a privilege.
38700	42700	Nowadays, within the society that I'm in, it's almost a deprivation not to have one.
42700	46200	Online and offline games have become infinitely more compatible with daily life,
46200	49800	and many revolutionary accessories have been released, retaining many gamers,
49800	52100	and increasing the younger demographic in particular.
52100	55400	Comparatively, my brother spends insane amounts of time on video games.
55400	58500	Even though I was a fairly passionate, avid gamer at his age,
58500	61100	there wasn't such a motivation to play said games.
61100	65000	Apparently, I'm not the only one who has noted a technological shift in the industry,
65000	69900	with the World Health Organization, abbreviated to the WHO, also recently picking up on it.
69900	75200	Now, the WHO, as they would be expected to, have a set of guidelines and classifications for diseases,
75200	79500	aptly named the International Classifications of Diseases, also abbreviated to ICD.
79500	82100	They're quite a verbose organization, and in a way, they have to be.
82100	86400	Now, given the evolving times, the ICD has to respectively evolve their classifications.
86400	89200	Their most recent revision, ICD-11, is in the works.
89200	92300	It is currently sat at a beta draft stage, to my understanding.
92300	97500	However, one inclusion that has raised a few eyebrows was the involvement of what they decided to name the gaming disorder.
97500	102000	On the website, it's located in the mental, developmental, and neurodevelopmental disorders section,
102000	105000	on the dropdown box from disorders due to addictive behaviors,
105000	107000	sat comfortably below the gambling disorder.
107000	109500	Now, if you're a casual gamer like many, this will not affect you.
109500	111300	In fact, it almost certainly won't affect you.
111300	112800	So what do people take issue with?
112800	117000	Well, I think it's the fact that an addictive personality could affect participation in any hobbies.
117000	120200	So what is people's problem if it really doesn't affect too many individuals?
120200	124400	Well, I think it's the legitimate point that it comes from the addictive personality.
124400	129400	I think people's point is that an addictive personality could affect participation in any hobbies, and that is true.
129400	133100	Why isn't there a tennis disorder, for example, for people who play too much tennis?
133100	138400	Firstly, I assume that other addictions, like the exemplary tennis disorder, would be covered under the other section,
138400	143000	but gaming probably has its own disorder now, not because there's anything unique about gaming as a concept,
143000	147600	but most probably because of the disproportionate amount of people, possibly in East Asian countries in particular,
147600	150400	who have really adopted a very fervent gaming culture.
150400	156600	In South Korea, for example, they even have laws preventing children under 16 from playing video games from 10pm to 6am
156600	159000	due to a number of gaming-related incidents,
159000	164100	as well as investing money into clinics and services to help combat what could be perceived as an epidemic.
164100	167400	So definitely, in some places, this distinction can be justified.
167400	172700	It's important to note that a disorder takes prevalence when it inhibits your ability to function in your daily life,
172700	174700	and the WHO do take note of that.
174700	177500	Once again, their definitions do have a generalised ability.
177500	181100	We've all probably done things before that have been a detriment to our health in hindsight,
181100	183200	but we did it anyway with the hope of some reward.
183200	185900	There's nothing exceptional about gaming from that perspective.
185900	189700	Gambling, to an extent, is a bit more distinctive as it involves monetary suffering.
189700	194300	There is a clear difference in investment, and the WHO have done a bit of a half-copy-paste job,
194300	196600	and the equivalence obviously isn't quite there yet.
196600	198400	Maybe they'll clean that up after the draft.
198400	203500	But the clarification that it does impair functions in daily life is an important component and that is emphasised,
203500	205100	so there is no discrediting them there.
205100	208900	Obviously, most things taken in excess will have some sort of implication,
208900	212900	but the WHO clearly believe there is some sort of exclusivity within gaming,
212900	214000	and to an extent, there is.
214000	217600	It's definitely a more immediate yet sedentary hobby, and it has its appeals.
217600	221800	However, I think one point that must be stressed is that it's not necessarily on the game for the disorder.
221800	225500	As the subdivision states, the main cause of this is an addictive personality,
225500	229500	which subsequently makes us question whether a gaming addiction is really a disorder in itself,
229500	231900	or just a symptom of an addictive personality.
231900	235400	On top of that, if we're placing gaming in the same group of age-restricted genres,
235400	239200	such as gambling and alcohol consumption, what implications does that have?
239200	243200	I think most people's problem is the slippery slope, that if this is affirmed as a disorder,
243200	246100	then it could be manipulated for a political agenda against gaming.
246100	251400	It's not impossible, there have always been moments by politicians who see gaming as this malevolent fiend that must be spited,
251400	255200	particularly those who tend to reference single-edged studies on a very double-edged sword.
255200	258400	In a way, this would open up many opportunities for new restrictions,
258400	261700	and that's obviously not what the WHO are dictating here.
261700	264700	And although certain individuals have accused the WHO of corruption,
264700	269100	they can't refrain from classification just because other individuals may manipulate it.
269100	272600	That would be on the public to call them out if they were behaving in such a way.
272600	274800	Whether the public would or not is another question.
274800	276400	It's a rather ambiguous debate.
276400	281500	Some parents would simply lavish the concept that they can pull out the gaming disorder against their belligerent child,
281500	284200	while others are far too impartial to even give a shit.
284200	291000	Not to mention that in a lot of Western countries, the authorities don't have their crusty claws in the regular household to the extent that I'm sure they'd love to.
291000	292600	And the law is quite lenient.
292600	298000	I mean, if you're a child, you could still be a homeschooled alcoholic in the UK, you're allowed to drink at five years old.
298000	300300	It's an interesting fact nugget, but there you have it.
300300	305100	So I highly doubt this will have too many implications, given the fact that gaming is mostly private,
305100	308800	and that the government can't really do too much without upsetting some businesses.
308800	312200	Maybe a possible sanction on public institutions like schools, maybe.
312200	316300	But then again, that's not gonna kill off too much, and school doesn't necessarily rely on gaming.
316300	319600	I'd hope at least, though, you know, times might have changed that much.
319600	324700	Either way, the gaming disorder is not to be confused with gaming, nor should gaming be confused as the cause.
324700	326200	It should not be reason to panic.
326200	328600	Your life will go on as many, I assume.
328600	333400	Although technicalities do make this incorporation somewhat questionable, that's how it's gonna be.
333400	336900	Anyway, I would love to hear your thoughts on the topic, it's certainly a curious one.
336900	340300	And until the next one, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you then.
