00:00.000 --> 00:01.500
An interesting topic.

00:07.500 --> 00:11.200
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

00:11.200 --> 00:15.400
And gaming, something that has undoubtedly become popularized in the last couple decades.

00:15.400 --> 00:17.700
I see an evolution. I see it in my own family.

00:17.700 --> 00:20.900
When I was growing up, I had some exposure to video games, but not too much,

00:20.900 --> 00:23.700
as its accessibility wasn't huge when I was a younger lad,

00:23.700 --> 00:27.600
and there wasn't really a gadget-focused culture until I was around 13 or 14,

00:27.600 --> 00:29.500
which I then kind of rejected anyway.

00:29.500 --> 00:32.600
I wasn't the biggest on phones or such, I had a brick, basically.

00:32.600 --> 00:35.300
It wasn't the most competitive thing, and it wasn't prevalent in culture.

00:35.300 --> 00:38.700
To have an impressive iPhone or iPad at a young age was a privilege.

00:38.700 --> 00:42.700
Nowadays, within the society that I'm in, it's almost a deprivation not to have one.

00:42.700 --> 00:46.200
Online and offline games have become infinitely more compatible with daily life,

00:46.200 --> 00:49.800
and many revolutionary accessories have been released, retaining many gamers,

00:49.800 --> 00:52.100
and increasing the younger demographic in particular.

00:52.100 --> 00:55.400
Comparatively, my brother spends insane amounts of time on video games.

00:55.400 --> 00:58.500
Even though I was a fairly passionate, avid gamer at his age,

00:58.500 --> 01:01.100
there wasn't such a motivation to play said games.

01:01.100 --> 01:05.000
Apparently, I'm not the only one who has noted a technological shift in the industry,

01:05.000 --> 01:09.900
with the World Health Organization, abbreviated to the WHO, also recently picking up on it.

01:09.900 --> 01:15.200
Now, the WHO, as they would be expected to, have a set of guidelines and classifications for diseases,

01:15.200 --> 01:19.500
aptly named the International Classifications of Diseases, also abbreviated to ICD.

01:19.500 --> 01:22.100
They're quite a verbose organization, and in a way, they have to be.

01:22.100 --> 01:26.400
Now, given the evolving times, the ICD has to respectively evolve their classifications.

01:26.400 --> 01:29.200
Their most recent revision, ICD-11, is in the works.

01:29.200 --> 01:32.300
It is currently sat at a beta draft stage, to my understanding.

01:32.300 --> 01:37.500
However, one inclusion that has raised a few eyebrows was the involvement of what they decided to name the gaming disorder.

01:37.500 --> 01:42.000
On the website, it's located in the mental, developmental, and neurodevelopmental disorders section,

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
on the dropdown box from disorders due to addictive behaviors,

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
sat comfortably below the gambling disorder.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.500
Now, if you're a casual gamer like many, this will not affect you.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.300
In fact, it almost certainly won't affect you.

01:51.300 --> 01:52.800
So what do people take issue with?

01:52.800 --> 01:57.000
Well, I think it's the fact that an addictive personality could affect participation in any hobbies.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.200
So what is people's problem if it really doesn't affect too many individuals?

02:00.200 --> 02:04.400
Well, I think it's the legitimate point that it comes from the addictive personality.

02:04.400 --> 02:09.400
I think people's point is that an addictive personality could affect participation in any hobbies, and that is true.

02:09.400 --> 02:13.100
Why isn't there a tennis disorder, for example, for people who play too much tennis?

02:13.100 --> 02:18.400
Firstly, I assume that other addictions, like the exemplary tennis disorder, would be covered under the other section,

02:18.400 --> 02:23.000
but gaming probably has its own disorder now, not because there's anything unique about gaming as a concept,

02:23.000 --> 02:27.600
but most probably because of the disproportionate amount of people, possibly in East Asian countries in particular,

02:27.600 --> 02:30.400
who have really adopted a very fervent gaming culture.

02:30.400 --> 02:36.600
In South Korea, for example, they even have laws preventing children under 16 from playing video games from 10pm to 6am

02:36.600 --> 02:39.000
due to a number of gaming-related incidents,

02:39.000 --> 02:44.100
as well as investing money into clinics and services to help combat what could be perceived as an epidemic.

02:44.100 --> 02:47.400
So definitely, in some places, this distinction can be justified.

02:47.400 --> 02:52.700
It's important to note that a disorder takes prevalence when it inhibits your ability to function in your daily life,

02:52.700 --> 02:54.700
and the WHO do take note of that.

02:54.700 --> 02:57.500
Once again, their definitions do have a generalised ability.

02:57.500 --> 03:01.100
We've all probably done things before that have been a detriment to our health in hindsight,

03:01.100 --> 03:03.200
but we did it anyway with the hope of some reward.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.900
There's nothing exceptional about gaming from that perspective.

03:05.900 --> 03:09.700
Gambling, to an extent, is a bit more distinctive as it involves monetary suffering.

03:09.700 --> 03:14.300
There is a clear difference in investment, and the WHO have done a bit of a half-copy-paste job,

03:14.300 --> 03:16.600
and the equivalence obviously isn't quite there yet.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.400
Maybe they'll clean that up after the draft.

03:18.400 --> 03:23.500
But the clarification that it does impair functions in daily life is an important component and that is emphasised,

03:23.500 --> 03:25.100
so there is no discrediting them there.

03:25.100 --> 03:28.900
Obviously, most things taken in excess will have some sort of implication,

03:28.900 --> 03:32.900
but the WHO clearly believe there is some sort of exclusivity within gaming,

03:32.900 --> 03:34.000
and to an extent, there is.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.600
It's definitely a more immediate yet sedentary hobby, and it has its appeals.

03:37.600 --> 03:41.800
However, I think one point that must be stressed is that it's not necessarily on the game for the disorder.

03:41.800 --> 03:45.500
As the subdivision states, the main cause of this is an addictive personality,

03:45.500 --> 03:49.500
which subsequently makes us question whether a gaming addiction is really a disorder in itself,

03:49.500 --> 03:51.900
or just a symptom of an addictive personality.

03:51.900 --> 03:55.400
On top of that, if we're placing gaming in the same group of age-restricted genres,

03:55.400 --> 03:59.200
such as gambling and alcohol consumption, what implications does that have?

03:59.200 --> 04:03.200
I think most people's problem is the slippery slope, that if this is affirmed as a disorder,

04:03.200 --> 04:06.100
then it could be manipulated for a political agenda against gaming.

04:06.100 --> 04:11.400
It's not impossible, there have always been moments by politicians who see gaming as this malevolent fiend that must be spited,

04:11.400 --> 04:15.200
particularly those who tend to reference single-edged studies on a very double-edged sword.

04:15.200 --> 04:18.400
In a way, this would open up many opportunities for new restrictions,

04:18.400 --> 04:21.700
and that's obviously not what the WHO are dictating here.

04:21.700 --> 04:24.700
And although certain individuals have accused the WHO of corruption,

04:24.700 --> 04:29.100
they can't refrain from classification just because other individuals may manipulate it.

04:29.100 --> 04:32.600
That would be on the public to call them out if they were behaving in such a way.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.800
Whether the public would or not is another question.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.400
It's a rather ambiguous debate.

04:36.400 --> 04:41.500
Some parents would simply lavish the concept that they can pull out the gaming disorder against their belligerent child,

04:41.500 --> 04:44.200
while others are far too impartial to even give a shit.

04:44.200 --> 04:51.000
Not to mention that in a lot of Western countries, the authorities don't have their crusty claws in the regular household to the extent that I'm sure they'd love to.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.600
And the law is quite lenient.

04:52.600 --> 04:58.000
I mean, if you're a child, you could still be a homeschooled alcoholic in the UK, you're allowed to drink at five years old.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.300
It's an interesting fact nugget, but there you have it.

05:00.300 --> 05:05.100
So I highly doubt this will have too many implications, given the fact that gaming is mostly private,

05:05.100 --> 05:08.800
and that the government can't really do too much without upsetting some businesses.

05:08.800 --> 05:12.200
Maybe a possible sanction on public institutions like schools, maybe.

05:12.200 --> 05:16.300
But then again, that's not gonna kill off too much, and school doesn't necessarily rely on gaming.

05:16.300 --> 05:19.600
I'd hope at least, though, you know, times might have changed that much.

05:19.600 --> 05:24.700
Either way, the gaming disorder is not to be confused with gaming, nor should gaming be confused as the cause.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.200
It should not be reason to panic.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.600
Your life will go on as many, I assume.

05:28.600 --> 05:33.400
Although technicalities do make this incorporation somewhat questionable, that's how it's gonna be.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.900
Anyway, I would love to hear your thoughts on the topic, it's certainly a curious one.

05:36.900 --> 05:40.300
And until the next one, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you then.
