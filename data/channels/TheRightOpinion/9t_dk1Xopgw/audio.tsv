0	2560	So whatever happened to that Grade A Under A fella?
2560	8720	If you piss off Grade A Under A, he's gonna do whatever he can to ruin you.
8720	10560	Grade like all of us is a liar.
10560	11840	There's a different standard for you.
11840	15520	It wouldn't be the first time you've lied, because basically you've lied a lot of times, mate.
15520	20320	And there's a different standard for Grade A Under A, and he will ruin you if he can.
30000	40000	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
40000	44360	too much free time, and today we continue the story of Grade A Under A.
44360	48280	If you haven't watched part 1, I would highly recommend doing so, because many of the narratives
48280	52880	that we discussed today are rooted in the previous video, however to aid continuity's
52880	57080	sake, we join our story less than a year after Grey's channel was resuscitated through
57080	58080	a Reddit post.
58080	62000	He had turned his content into some of the most unique and marketable work on YouTube,
62000	64180	and was approaching the peak of his career.
64180	68720	He was stepping effortlessly between his drama and non-drama content, and gaining support
68720	70360	at an unassailable rate.
70360	74980	The sudden interest in an actual genre that could generate its own content whilst simultaneously
74980	79440	being able to comment on it definitely had its appeals, and being a person of strong,
79440	83100	unmitigated sentiments, Grade had found his rhythm.
83100	88620	His content picked up to an unbelievable pace at around mid-January of 2016, just after
88620	92780	the release of his second Nicole Arber video, in which he breaks down Arber's side of
92780	97260	her abuse story against Matthew Santoro, and exposes some rather glowing inconsistencies
97260	101660	within her testimony, but equally as quick as he took off, he was to encounter his fair
101660	104620	share of drama, the tables were about to turn.
104620	108220	His first warning of this should have come with a very small YouTuber by the name of
108220	109220	Reactor.
109220	113220	Reactor is a satire channel who parodied a lot of larger reaction channels.
113220	118380	Now Reactor had barely 30 subscribers, and therefore basically posed no threat, but he
118380	122700	decided that given Grade's rather outspoken position on reaction channels, he'd meddle
122700	124660	a little on Grade's own channel.
124660	128980	Now this is where we harken back to Grade's Vegan Gains video, because in the Vegan Gains
128980	134460	video, what Grade did was remix Vegan Gains' words and turn it into this wacky, hilarious
134460	135460	parody.
135460	139140	Grade did much of the same, but did it more convincingly because Grade doesn't show his
139140	143020	face, and therefore if you weren't paying attention, the difference in tone may have
143020	144020	gone over your head.
144020	147020	Grade- One of my favourite YouTube channels is Reactor, right?
147020	150900	Despite what they say, this guy is fucking genius.
150900	155540	Your videos do show your reactions, but they're fucking genius, right?
155540	156540	That was genius, man.
156540	159140	That was a really nice touch to the video.
159140	161140	Literally over 95% genius.
161140	163620	That's something to be proud of.
163620	167140	It's still pretty obvious, but maybe some of the younger audience failed to detect the
167140	172160	contrast in tone and audio quality, so Reactor uploaded this and then paid a few hundred
172160	177140	to have the video shown as an ad before Grade's videos, basically fooling a few naive people
177140	180420	into thinking that Grade had given Reactor a shoutout.
180420	185060	He then gave this video extra publicity, and even more ironically, by using the reddit
185060	188800	system to promote the documentation of his little project.
188800	190860	It was a pretty genius prank.
190860	195340	Fortunately, Grade didn't find it too funny, not just leaving multiple rather vexed comments
195340	199780	on Reactor's video, but then subsequently bringing it up in a future video when discussing
199780	200780	the situation.
200780	205220	Grade- I've also had some guy use my copyrighted material to put together a fake advert for
205220	209340	himself which deceived and fooled a bunch of people into subscribing to it.
209340	213240	And although this certainly didn't lead to much at the time, it should have been foreshadowing
213240	216220	that Grade wasn't quite the critic that he had sculpted.
216220	220500	That sort of attitude doesn't really wash with a channel that's a fraction of his
220500	222540	size, and clearly taking the piss.
222540	227340	And make no mistake, it was blatant bait, but so was Grade's video on Vegan Gains.
227340	231500	The difference with Reactor's video is if Grade takes the bait, he proves Reactor's
231500	232500	point.
232500	236040	Grade- I think I get it now, you fuck with other YouTube channels to create controversy,
236040	239720	and then when people start fucking with you, you cry for sympathy.
239720	243740	Now I don't entirely agree with the point that Grade blew up solely off drama, it's
243740	247960	clear he had some very interesting components to his character beyond that, but by being
247960	252060	angry at someone over something that many people would agree isn't a big deal, and
252060	271340	lambasting behaviours that he'd previously overlooked and even indulged in himself, it
271340	275760	showed him up as lacking some self-awareness, and self-awareness is one of the essentials
275760	277120	to delivering criticism.
277120	282500	This wasn't a big deal, but it was a warning, a warning that was not heeded, unfortunately.
282500	286960	Now as the year progressed we started to see more drama, and this led to various creators
286960	288760	weighing in specific situations.
288760	293600	One of the most significant movements was the larger YouTuber movement against drama,
293600	299220	made by people such as Markiplier, PewDiePie, and Matthew Santoro, basically criticising
299220	303600	the drama that had been going on within the community, because it was fairly recognisable
303600	304600	at that point.
304600	308720	Grade was a fairly staunch defender though of the drama, because it probably gave him
308720	313400	views, but likely because he was on good terms with two people, Leafy and Keemstar, people
313400	315680	who benefited off drama greatly.
315680	320560	Grade always had a way of turning response videos, even if they made valid points into
320560	325760	exposed videos of their own, and his response video to the drama was no different, as at
325760	331220	the end he inserted a little part exposing Matthew Santoro for allegedly plagiarising
331220	345700	content.
345700	350040	Now it wasn't relevant to the points that he was making with regards to the video, but
350040	355300	Grade wanted to survive, and it served as a spicy side dish, and really impacted Santoro's
355340	359780	ability to speak on matters again, and like the cute little double team they are, Drama
359780	361380	Alert reported it later on.
361380	370580	And now for our final story, today GradeAUnderA uploaded a video calling three YouTubers,
370580	376960	PewDiePie, Markiplier, and Matthew Santoro, on their drama videos, but towards the end
376960	384780	of the video, Matthew Santoro got it the worse, as GradeAUnderA exposed him, exposed him,
384780	385780	for plagiarism.
385780	390460	This is all important information, in a Reddit Q&A on March the 3rd, someone asked Grade for
390460	395520	his opinion on Keemstar, Grade replied that he liked him, and that he's genuinely been
395520	400520	nothing but nice to him from the start, he has no reason to hate him at all.
400520	404300	Grade loved drama, so it was only natural that he was going to love someone who supported
404300	408500	that cycle, and Keemstar probably loved him for the exact same reasons.
408500	412660	Grade would appear on Drama Alert and regularly interact with Papa Keem, however as the year
412660	416860	progressed you got the feeling that Grade involved himself with drama for the sake of
416860	421420	it being drama, rather than the fact that he actually felt strongly about these things,
421420	425760	and when there were actual reputations of his associates at stake, he had a habit of
425760	429580	going a bit quiet, such as the Leafy rant.
429580	434140	Keemstar reported on it, offered H3 and Leafy a way to hash it out, Grade didn't really
434140	438980	say much other than pulling the plug on a planned podcast between him, Leafy, and Sky
438980	444020	Williams after having a serious conversation which they would rather not talk about.
444020	449220	That situation was to become extremely messy in no time at all, but Leafy eventually emerged
449220	454660	in just about one piece, partly due to the unity inspired by the Matt Hoss situation.
454660	459380	But then barely two months later, the tables turned once more, when the man himself, iDubbbz,
459380	464860	released a fairly comprehensive content cop on Keemstar, making him practically indefensible,
464860	467560	and suddenly the drama came very close to home.
467560	472780	But there wasn't a rush of responses immediately, no, this was to come in June, with videos
472780	477400	from other creators like Pyrocynical also garnering impressive amounts of views.
477400	479540	It's one of his most viewed to this day.
479540	483760	The Leafy shark caught a scent of blood and decided to move in on his old pal, and going
483760	488660	into battle alongside him was the man himself, Grade A under A. Keemstar seemed to be the
488660	493060	easiest target on the platform, he was bleeding subs, and you would be very hard pressed to
493060	498280	find his fanbase outside of his own comment section, and there was a genuine expectation
498280	501020	for his child to just collapse at any moment.
501060	505660	However, at this moment, the moment where everything seemed the easiest, the drama would
505660	507660	bring them far too close to the sun.
517080	522260	Now, I obviously mentioned during my previous part what Grade said in his Reddit post about Keemstar.
522260	526540	To summarise, he has conducted some fairly questionable actions, but at the end of it
526700	532980	he's been nothing but supportive of him and his work, and helped expand his channel and stand up for his content.
532980	538320	So with the sudden tidal wave of hatred going towards Keem, with his channel haemorrhaging subscribers,
538320	540320	what position would Grade take?
549780	551780	That doesn't sound so supportive.
551820	555620	Now that clips from his second part, but the first part is no less brutal.
555620	560420	For context, with his old pal Leafy turning fairly viciously on Keem, Grade found himself
560420	565860	back in the crossfire, but a fairly one-sided crossfire at that, with Leafy's video allegedly
565860	567980	nailing Keem down for his behaviour.
567980	572140	The thing is that Leafy's video really pulls Grade into it and ties him in that future
572140	574340	position that he has to take.
574340	578540	This was probably done with some coordination, they're in this together, and this is important,
578540	581300	I want you to hold this point in your head for later.
581300	585340	And Killer Keemstar is pretty much the most hated man on the internet right now.
585340	588420	So many exposed videos have been made on this guy, right?
588420	593820	But they do nothing to him, he's the cockroach of YouTube, he keeps fucking surviving.
593820	600900	But listen, hopefully that'll end with this organised attack that's been going on over the past week or two.
600900	605140	Basically, the setting of Grade's two videos was that he was hoping he could be part of
605140	609780	this extremely organised campaign to remove Keemstar from the platform altogether.
609780	614580	He had noticed that there had been a run of videos made on him, and thought that he could finish him off.
614580	619780	A lot of his points were about Keem's behaviour, claims such as doxing, false pedophile allegations,
619780	625380	hypocrisy, exploitation, the victim card, racism, harassment, and domestic abuse.
625380	629380	Some of these were not like claims at all, and would have serious repercussions.
629380	635380	Grade listed them off to prove a point, that Keemstar is someone who should never be given any platform whatsoever.
635380	638180	As exposed videos go, it's comprehensive for sure.
638180	643180	Some claims were fairly well substantiated and convincing, others a bit more risky,
643180	648980	and certainly should have been more thoroughly researched, such as pedophile or domestic abuse allegations.
648980	651580	I'm not sure they would have passed in today's environment.
651580	655180	But who cared? People were dunking on Keemstar left, right, and centre,
655180	659380	and if there was a bit of collateral damage done, well, karma, right?
659380	664380	His child was on his way down anyway, it wasn't like he was going to come back from this.
664580	668980	At the end of the video, Grade endorses Keem's number one competitor, Scarce,
668980	671380	saying that he's been killing it recently.
671380	675380	This was an attempt to make Keem irrelevant, and having a news source on the website
675380	678180	that covered drama and didn't instigate it.
678180	683180	This video won over a lot of people, and it still wins over people to this day,
683180	687780	and I can understand why, but with all the information that I had researched with regards to this,
687780	693780	I couldn't help but feel a bit uncomfortable when Grade was going off about how anyone could support him,
693780	696980	when he'd been supporting him less than a few months before.
696980	701180	Now, what you could say is that he was ignorant to certain incidents,
701180	705180	and the unearthing of these incidents in the following months had shifted his position.
705180	708980	But it's hard to fully believe that perspective when certain examples arise,
708980	715580	such as his false pedo allegation against the YouTuber RSGloryandGold that happened in around January 2016.
715580	720180	Now, everyone knew about that, but Grade seems pretty harsh in how he frames it,
720180	726780	and even as a former friend, it's hard to process that someone would turn so brutally out of genuine sentiment,
726780	731980	to the point that they would knowingly run on very shaky abuse and pedophilia allegations.
731980	737980	It doesn't feel real, and let me make it clear, I've turned on people when I think that they haven't learned their lesson,
737980	744380	but many of these examples are years old, and the logic implied through much of this is that the person that Grade was supportive of
744380	749980	is suddenly undermined by his old behaviour, and there are definitely claims that aren't undone by age,
749980	752780	but they're normally the ones with the least substantiation.
752780	756780	I find most of Grade's claims, as someone who is a former friend of Keemstar,
756780	761780	to either fall into the category of things that Grade definitely knew about and probably acknowledged,
761780	765580	things that were so old that they could be undone by present experience,
765580	768780	or things that are lacking evidence or necessary context.
768780	773180	There are expectations to this, and Keem was deserving of a lot of criticism,
773180	779780	but it felt much like a bandwagon on their part, and in a way, the Keemstar drama would be the escalation of the year,
779780	783980	and once you reach a climax, you're only setting yourself up for disappointment.
783980	789980	And so that's what you saw, a gradual tail-off until September, at which point, of course,
789980	795980	iDubbbz dropped his content cop on Leafy, and there was once again an immediate effect.
795980	801780	Now, I could talk about iDubbbz's content cop forever, there's a lot to say about it, and it's probably better that I save that,
801780	808780	but the real telling effect of it is that it hit Grade too, even though he only made one very brief appearance in it.
808980	815780	Grade, he said a bunch of, uh, critical shit of Keemstar, but then on top of that, he couldn't just leave it there.
815780	818580	He had to say that Scarce is killing him recently.
818580	820580	Go subscribe to Scarce!
820580	827580	Don't subscribe to Scarce. I know I'm months behind on this one, but subscribe to Scarce when his content gets better.
827580	831780	Scarce is overweight, but more importantly than that, Scarce is boring.
831780	836380	Grade A and Leafy, complete fucking retards. Actual retards.
836380	838180	Yo, is this person fucking retarded?
838180	838780	Yes.
838780	840580	Yo, is this person fucking retarded?
840580	841180	Yes.
841180	847180	However, I think the moment that broke both Leafy and Grade's credibility was this part.
847180	853180	If Keemstar's a rat, then Leafy is a fucking snake. Greasy, slimy, slithery cunt.
853180	861180	And I say both Leafy and Grade's credibility because, as I mentioned earlier, Leafy and Grade tied themselves together in that drama,
861180	863380	that personal experience with Keemstar.
863380	867180	iDubbbz's quote calling Leafy Egg Snake is no less applicable to Grade.
867180	872380	Both of them purposely distanced themselves from someone who they knew much better than they let on,
872380	876580	and even if the criticisms were legitimate, you turn it back on them and say,
876580	881180	well, why did they associate themselves with him in the first place if they were aware of this?
881180	886180	iDubbbz, in a very short amount of time, revealed Leafy and Grade for the Fairweather friends that they were.
886180	891180	iDubbbz's video also came out at a time where the hype around Grade's channel was rather low.
891180	897980	There was a significant lack of drama occurring, and iDubbbz had the chance to really halt whatever momentum they had, and he did.
897980	904180	Grade lost 3,500 subscribers on the day of the video, and this wasn't going to ease up in the following weeks.
904180	910980	A lot of people wonder why iDubbbz's video hit Grade, and in particular Leafy, so much that it caused long-term damage.
910980	918180	Well, partly because their appeal was based on their credibility as creators, and iDubbbz fundamentally managed to undermine that.
918180	924180	Equally, iDubbbz is a person with such a clearly defined moral compass, regardless of whether you agree with him or not,
924180	928180	it makes it very hard to turn around to him and try and lecture him on anything.
928180	934180	Grade once again found himself in the crossfire, with the person he went into battle with now taking significant flak.
934180	936180	How could he respond?
936180	938180	Well, let's discuss that.
939180	952180	There was this expectation that given that he was called out by iDubbbz, he would respond alongside Leafy,
952180	957180	and with the information given today, and the way he's behaved, it really shouldn't surprise us.
957180	963180	With that said, even if you think your friend might have done some stupid shit, if you were genuinely invested in their future,
963180	967180	you'd still probably make a case that they could learn from this, and we should move forward.
967180	974180	But Grade chose not to. No one was entitled to a defence, and sometimes the best thing to do in these circumstances is just to say nothing at all.
974180	978180	But still, that's not exactly what he did.
978180	983180	Now, after the first day, his subscriber count didn't necessarily bleed like Leafy's, but it did stagnate,
983180	988180	and whether that was motivation for Grade to make a video on it or not is another question,
988180	991180	but regardless of the question, he did receive an answer.
991180	995180	So let's talk about the videos that prolonged his suffering.
995180	999180	The thing is, the video that he made isn't actually to do with the drama,
999180	1004180	it's more to do with how he's felt drained, and uninspired, and something that we all feel.
1004180	1009180	However, I can understand why a lot of people interpreted this as a victim card.
1009180	1016180	If you believe Grade was rather calculated and cynical, then this would be the best way to gain sympathy from an unsuspecting audience,
1016180	1019180	without necessarily responding to claims.
1019180	1026180	As we've all seen, many people with legitimate reason thought it was in Grade's nature to not be the most honest in his videos.
1026180	1031180	With that said, it wouldn't surprise me if Grade did legitimately feel fed up of making videos.
1031180	1036180	The hype had died, the drama alongside it. It was a sad time for his content.
1036180	1043180	It was also, in a way, his own doing. He contributed to that culture, and I'm sure he was aware of that.
1043180	1048180	When you lose your excitement and your enthusiasm for making videos, you don't feel that urge to go that extra mile,
1048180	1054180	to make the video go from just good to amazing, and it ends up just being meh instead, do you know what I mean?
1054180	1057180	And because of that, the videos start to suffer.
1057180	1062180	And what struck me about this video is that on reflection, over the spell of 2016,
1062180	1068180	particularly in the three or four months in reference, the videos became significantly less comedic in their delivery.
1068180	1072180	And this is where we bring back my first part of this very lengthy saga,
1072180	1075180	where he spoke about what made his videos quite entertaining.
1075180	1080180	No longer was there that attention to detail, those comedic pauses, that feeling of build-up,
1080180	1086180	but more just a continuous flow of rants, and because of that, it kind of killed any sort of tension that may lead to laughs.
1086180	1092180	And as I mentioned, a joke is much more than just its punchline, and I feel that Grade lost that.
1092180	1096180	And although it wasn't like he didn't have good jokes, it was just that they didn't land as well.
1096180	1101180	Especially my last video, right? I wasn't happy with that video at all, but I still felt like I had to upload it.
1101180	1104180	Why did they skip Vitamins B, 8, 10, and 11?
1104180	1111180	And fog-skipping those numbers, that wouldn't even be an issue in the first place, had you not called them all Vitamin B!
1111180	1115180	Especially when there are empty slots for Vitamins F through J.
1115180	1122180	It sometimes felt like he'd lost awareness of how he had set his character up, in that semi-satirical fashion of the judgmental prick.
1122180	1127180	His more modern content seemed to lack that irony, and maybe this was due to the drama,
1127180	1131180	which led Grade to making much more serious videos that relied on conveying credibility.
1131180	1136180	Up until this situation, we constantly let comedy get in the way of actual points.
1136180	1140180	A great example would have been the PewDiePie, Markiplier, Santoro response video.
1140180	1147180	There were a ton of ad hominems there, and we almost just completely overlooked them because they were part of Grade's character,
1147180	1150180	but both of those sides were becoming dangerously integrated.
1150180	1154180	In his latest video, is Grade overreacting to drama as a joke?
1154180	1158180	Is it the same Grade who ranted about interviews as a gag,
1158180	1164180	or is it a new Grade who wants us to take his word seriously while still keeping up the same tone and demeanor?
1164180	1167180	And how can you just go from one persona like that to the other?
1167180	1171180	H3 is an example of people who can do that, or did that,
1171180	1177180	because they knew how to differentiate their style between their regular humorous content and their serious videos,
1177180	1179180	which called out YouTube and YouTubers alike.
1179180	1186180	Grade didn't do that, and maybe because he couldn't see the vast difference between his drama-related content and his more casual videos.
1186180	1189180	Maybe it didn't occur to him, but there was a difference,
1189180	1193180	and it was pulling him into a position that he couldn't afford to maintain.
1193180	1196180	Because drama doesn't last, your character does,
1196180	1200180	and if you build a persona off drama, or you let it be influenced by it,
1200180	1204180	then when the drama dies, your shortcomings will be exposed as a crater.
1204180	1206180	And that was the problem with Grade's drama videos,
1206180	1211180	it was all created on the basis of its content, and not really the person talking,
1211180	1214180	who really wasn't that reasonable as a persona.
1214180	1221180	Drama drained Grade's personality, and then when he tried to reapply it to his regular content, it didn't feel the same.
1221180	1228180	Grade's first video mainly caused a loss in subscribers because it felt like it was a very indirect way to respond to the content cop,
1228180	1231180	and I can't look into Grade's mind and see what he was thinking,
1231180	1234180	but I do see it as a bit too good to be a coincidence,
1234180	1237180	that he would release such a video in the circumstances.
1237180	1241180	However, he wasn't finished. Throughout the weeks following the content cop,
1241180	1246180	there was significant backlash from a few creators, such as Sinnoh, Quentin Reviews and Tommy C.
1246180	1251180	These creators brought a variety of different points to the table, some more valid than others,
1251180	1258180	and for the first time, Grade was staring down serious criticism, and serious allegations. How would he respond?
1258180	1263180	Listen, some of these allegations are fucking crazy, so I didn't see any reason to address them, right?
1263180	1266180	But as it turns out, some people actually believe in them!
1266180	1272180	Seriously though, YouTube's not the site that it used to be. It has gone from this, to this.
1272180	1277180	People are desperate for drama, so I need to quickly address all the allegations in this video,
1277180	1283180	before they start getting out of hand, and I'm being accused of planning 9-11, and being in the fucking Illuminati.
1283180	1288180	Right, with all the context now, of this video, you can't even begin to comprehend the irony of this.
1288180	1292180	A person who was more than happy to make weak claims against someone else,
1292180	1296180	is now outraged that other people are making weak claims against him.
1296180	1298180	Once again, some are valid, some are not.
1298180	1303180	But then he has the audacity to pull this YouTube isn't the same anymore card,
1303180	1305180	despite being a torchbearer for drama.
1305180	1312180	The video comprises of him responding to a few claims, most of them straw manned in a way that made it easier for him to respond to them,
1312180	1316180	because that's what you can do when you're the person acting as your own critic.
1316180	1321180	And yes, sometimes it can be entertaining or funny, but it should be acknowledged as a comedic measure,
1321180	1323180	not an actual argumentation strategy.
1323180	1329180	Well you know what I heard? I heard Greyde is a pedophile!
1329180	1335180	And this video is where I think the wheels really started to come off the Grey Train. Let's explain why.
1335180	1347180	I've always said, being able to respond to drama is an essential aspect of participating in drama.
1347180	1353180	Greyde's response may have worked at the time, with his fanbase, but in retrospect it does not hold up at all,
1353180	1357180	not in my opinion at least, especially with the context considered.
1357180	1363180	He said some insanely racist shit against minorities, and I'm a minority myself,
1363180	1368180	and people say it's a business decision. These are words that came from his mouth, and his mouth alone.
1368180	1376180	So if I don't stick by my racist friend and tickle his balls while he makes racist statements about a group of people that I myself belong to,
1376180	1379180	that's backstabbing, is it?
1379180	1388180	I'm sorry, as racist as what Keem said was, it bemuses me to think that Greyde had only just found this years old content out
1389180	1397180	and at that point, after everything, decided to break off a friendship of which he had described Keemstar as nothing but supportive of him,
1397180	1404180	rather than confronting Keem about his transgressions. By comparing Keem to a member of the KKK,
1404180	1410180	it just shows how redundant these arguments are, and completely dismissive of all context.
1410180	1415180	It's quite funny how some people only care about racism when they can use it to prove a point.
1415180	1419180	I mean, you could literally have a logical, fassy day out here.
1419180	1421180	He starts off with the strawman,
1427180	1432180	then he makes a false equivalence, before gaslighting his critics, implying they've been manipulated.
1439180	1444180	He then responds to the allegation that he inspired a million dollar lawsuit against Matthew Santoro,
1444180	1449180	which should be an easy thing to respond to, I mean, no one has any evidence of that.
1449180	1454180	Just say it's not true, and that didn't happen, and the burden of proof is on your critics,
1454180	1457180	but he takes it down this very bizarre route.
1457180	1464180	He's an online cartoonist who can barely draw, yet despite this, I apparently encouraged a large company
1464180	1467180	to file a million dollar lawsuit against someone.
1467180	1471180	Guys, he's an online cartoonist who can barely draw.
1471180	1476180	He has no influence, bar the 3 million subscribers of course, but don't mention them.
1476180	1481180	Like, why would you say that? I'm a guy who speaks into his microphone and lives in a one room flat.
1481180	1484180	What influence do I have, guys? Don't listen to me.
1484180	1489180	Now, I don't necessarily believe the claim, but to respond to the claim saying that you don't have influence
1489180	1491180	is a weird way to respond.
1491180	1496180	He then basically spends the next part of the video working out how to disassociate him from the narrative
1496180	1498180	that grouped him and Leafy together.
1499180	1501180	Fuck you, grade, you and Leafy-
1501180	1508180	Listen, like I said, right, I am not Leafy. I honestly cannot fucking believe that I'm having to explain this, right?
1508180	1515180	But this guy is not this guy, and I'm getting dragged into drama that has nothing to do with me because of this.
1515180	1522180	Like for example, right, during the iDubbbz and LeafyIsHair drama, despite me being neither of these two YouTubers,
1522180	1525180	some people expected me to get involved in this drama for some reason.
1525180	1528180	Essentially trying to untie the anchor from his ankle.
1528180	1534180	Despite the fact that he was boasting in his original video on Keem, this was very clearly an organised attack,
1534180	1538180	and joking about the actual vocal association in other videos.
1538180	1545180	But listen, hopefully that'll end with this organised attack that's been going on over the past week or two.
1545180	1551180	First Pyrocynical, then Leafy, and now I'm making a video on Keemstar.
1551180	1553180	Listen, I don't want to make a big deal out of this, right?
1553180	1561180	But this many YouTubers of this size making videos calling out Keemstar realistically will not happen again, right?
1561180	1567180	If you hate Keemstar, this is your one chance to get rid of him. So make it count.
1567180	1570180	You can't pretend that never happens.
1570180	1576180	What is there to say? I could go on and on about this response video, but in my opinion it is fairly terrible,
1576180	1581180	and although it still received moderate support at the time, he was digging his own grave.
1581180	1584180	With this video came another hit to subs.
1584180	1588180	The sharks were circling, he was called out publicly for some meltdowns that happened in the months prior,
1589180	1591180	some on Reddit, some on stream.
1591180	1596180	Go read that comment, go tell that fucking whore that's a mod on my fucking subreddit to link you to what I said to delete.
1596180	1598180	Go tell it to link it, it's not bad at all.
1598180	1604180	But why? Why was this happening? This person who had literally forgot his channel existed at one point,
1604180	1612180	who clearly didn't consider YouTube a big deal, was now being perceived as this megalomania, and not without evidence.
1612180	1619180	Well, I guess it's just the rabbit hole that sometimes people fall down, and in a way, we all fell down it with him,
1619180	1623180	because he was one of the original guys who went after these creators and exposed them.
1623180	1630180	Vegan Gains, Nicole Arber, even Ray William Johnson, but at the same time, they weren't the hardest people to go after,
1630180	1636180	they were targets for whom we didn't really care how they were treated, just that they were sorted out for one reason or another.
1636180	1642180	We wanted them gone, and now Grey has serious criticism facing him down, his responses just won't work,
1642180	1648180	because he's going against people who haven't established enough of a reputation to be hated.
1648180	1655180	The problem is, when we support people who argue in the way that Grey did, even to people we passionately hate,
1655180	1661180	even to people we view as terrible human beings, we risk them turning around and turning their hoards on the wrong person,
1661180	1666180	on a person who might just be a victim of mentality, with the same approach that we've endorsed.
1666180	1672180	There are plenty of positions that I hate, there are people that I dislike, but at the end of the day,
1672180	1678180	as cathartic and as tempting as it is to just go after someone's credibility, it's a risky measure long term.
1678180	1683180	You risk influencing people to adopt that philosophy of discounting someone on a trivial basis,
1683180	1689180	and even if you can wield that power properly and work out when someone should get it or when someone shouldn't,
1689180	1694180	you're working with people who themselves are not as careful. On top of this, you're promoting a market
1694180	1700180	in which it's successful to behave that way, which will create clones who are less nuanced than yourself.
1700180	1705180	Now I want to make it very clear, we are allowed to make fun of each other, we are allowed to make fun of other commentators,
1705180	1714180	even if the joke is lined in a level of cynicism, but mockery of someone's credibility is not a sufficient substitute for a point,
1714180	1718180	maybe complementary in some instances, but not as a substitute.
1718180	1724180	Grade was successful because his persona often disguised how some of his videos did tend to lack validity,
1724180	1729180	not necessarily to what he was saying, but to the discussion that was trying to be had.
1729180	1736180	Look at the Matthew Santoro video, and when he didn't have the arguments, he'd substitute them for more fallacies,
1736180	1740180	with a tone that implied authority, but never really earned it.
1740180	1748180	So, with this all in mind, Grade's sort of empire was coming to an end. Two incidents, two sub-drops,
1748180	1755180	and a third time, he would've been a fool to make the same mistake, so I guess for him it was time to move on.
1755180	1760180	And he did. But what did he move on to exactly? Well, let's find out.
1760180	1773180	So with all this behind him, Grade decided to turn back to the lighthearted genre of politics.
1773180	1780180	Yes, now remember, this is towards the back end of 2016, and that means it was at the presidential election time,
1780180	1784180	Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were battling it out for the White House.
1784180	1789180	Grade decided to cover this topic more meticulously than any of his previous situations,
1789180	1793180	releasing a total of five videos, initiating with a critique of Casey Neistat,
1793180	1799180	following interviews of both the main presidential candidates, an analysis of the American voting system,
1799180	1805180	and concluding with a review of the reaction to, spoiler alert, Donald Trump's victory.
1805180	1811180	The videos themselves were fine enough, I guess. He did go a bit more in-depth on Clinton, mind you,
1811180	1817180	though I guess it made sense, because he likes to make exposed videos, and there's more for you to actually expose with Hillary,
1817180	1824180	Donald Trump just continuously exposed himself, makes his job less fun, and he does in the end lend support to Sanders and Stein,
1824180	1828180	so he certainly wasn't necessarily being sympathetic to either of the main candidates.
1828180	1834180	Beyond that, the videos aren't particularly bad in their points, though it was certainly interesting to see someone like Grade
1834180	1840180	talking about politics, not without their jokes in the delivery of course, but the points were all fairly serious.
1840180	1846180	Now after this, he had his last really well performing video on people who hate video games,
1846180	1851180	well performing for his size, of course, I mean, a lot of people dream of his consistent view count.
1851180	1856180	After that, however, the views were fairly standard. He then returned to his more comedic style,
1856180	1862180	and actually I think he was being fairly funny again. His arguments were more based in common sense than previous,
1862180	1868180	and his tone had become a lot more uniform, just that one very angry guy, but he had some good jokes that would
1868180	1871180	play off the rage fairly well, and did have some flow.
1871180	1877180	I know I made a video a little while ago defending video games right, but despite how much I fucking love them right,
1877180	1883180	there are some things I do find kind of annoying about them. Nothing big though, just a few small complaints.
1883180	1888180	That made me want to throw my fucking controller through the TV.
1888180	1893180	Maybe the drama dragged him down, and now he's out of it, he felt a bit more liberated, but at the same time,
1893180	1899180	it also meant he lost a lot of support that came from the more drama oriented fans who'd moved on to creators
1899180	1906180	who were more associated with trending topics. By 2017, none of the new videos really cracked the ceiling of 2 million views
1906180	1912180	after a video game upload, however, on the other hand, his drama videos were unlikely to do as well as they previously did,
1912180	1918180	because the drama kinda died, and he had distanced himself from it. In fact, following the political videos,
1918180	1924180	the only time he really covered drama again was in the PewDiePie vs Wall Street Journal video, which was extremely late to the party,
1924180	1930180	later than me. In a way, he'd split his audience down the middle, and there was no longer that guaranteed interest
1930180	1935180	in what he spoke about. There were better commentary channels taking on the drama topics,
1935180	1938180	but at least he had his more casual rant topics, right?
1938180	1944180	Well, 2016 was the year of the storytime animators who really began taking on the qualms of daily life,
1944180	1950180	and other topics in a similar field, providing Grade with real competition, and squeezing his market.
1950180	1955180	People had noticed the fertile grounds and started farming, and Grade didn't really change it up,
1955180	1961180	and in a way, could he? He still did fine for himself, but I guess even when you're doing well,
1961180	1965180	it can feel like you're going nowhere, if it doesn't feel like progress.
1965180	1971180	Grade was never a celebrity, he never had droves of people following him around every time he left his house,
1971180	1976180	and that was his choice, for many reasons I think are likely sensible and justified.
1976180	1981180	But one thing that I've noticed is that when you're not public, your life seems fairly ordinary,
1981180	1986180	even with whatever success you're experiencing, you're not witnessing the real world repercussions
1986180	1991180	of the content you make because you're still behind a screen. This can often alienate you from the impact
1991180	1996180	of your content and even its success. Being a YouTuber really hasn't been much of a rush for me,
1996180	2001180	because I haven't really changed my life at all, mainly because I want to finish my education,
2001180	2006180	and so my lifestyle hasn't really altered beyond the fact that I spend most of my free time on YouTube,
2006180	2011180	driving myself insane. I have a hunch that even with his success, Grade never really experienced it
2011180	2017180	because he kept himself away from that world. I don't think that's a bad thing, but I do think it can lead
2017180	2023180	to someone taking hiatus because it doesn't give them any satisfaction in return, and after PewDiePie vs
2023180	2029180	Wall Street Journal video in March 2017, Grade did just that, he fell off the map.
2029180	2036180	Until a few months later in May 2017, when Grade uploaded another video, implying that he was coming back,
2036180	2041180	his hand coming from the grave, and announcing that there would be more YouTube videos and Twitch streams,
2041180	2047180	with the audience's heart in his hands. This led to absolutely nothing for another two months, until
2047180	2054180	when Grade announced his return in a much more elaborate video, and announcing that this would be the start of Season 2.
2055180	2073180	In his video, he announces how he plans to go back to his more grassroots comedy, as it used to be,
2073180	2079180	how he realised that pleasing the algorithms and merely appealing to trending topics just leads you to hating
2079180	2085180	your general experience as a YouTuber, and why he was not going to conform to it. He also rants about how
2085180	2091180	Jake Paul is ruining the site and driving all creativity down with it, he says he's been working on videos
2091180	2097180	since the week before his upload, so understandably many people were excited to see what he was going to bring
2097180	2102180	to his next video, if we ever received a next video, which we didn't for a long, long time.
2102180	2107180	I don't think Grade was trolling when he uploaded his return videos, it would be a pretty funny troll,
2107180	2112180	but I think it was very probable that he did have trouble being in the mood to record his content,
2112180	2118180	and finding that recipe that worked for him all the times before. Drama is a rush, when you're involved in it,
2118180	2123180	and you have the power to end careers, it's like you're Thanos with the Infinity Stones, and then it's gone,
2123180	2128180	and you can't recapture that, and sometimes when people can't do that, they just lose faith.
2128180	2133180	Normal content is a rhythm, and to find that you have to have a grip on what you're creating,
2133180	2138180	a rush will disrupt that rhythm. Grade did eventually return, at the start of this year,
2138180	2144180	we all had the sinking feeling that he wouldn't stick around, because although the hype for him was here,
2144180	2149180	it was more an anticipation about his return, rather than actually investing in his content.
2149180	2154180	His return video performed excellently, the videos following it, not so much.
2154180	2160180	Do I think Grade regrets the drama? Maybe he does, at the time I can see why it's so enticing to get involved,
2161180	2166180	but looking back on it, his content that had the most longevity are the videos that aren't on drama,
2166180	2172180	the content that is just about everyone's daily lives, because people's lives aren't going to be changing soon,
2172180	2177180	at least I don't think they are, and therefore, when you make content about that, it's always relevant,
2177180	2180180	no matter their demographic, or the time that they're watching the video.
2180180	2186180	Back when this screenshot was taken at the start of 2017, you can see that the difference between these two videos
2186180	2193180	is around 100,000 views, and yet returning to his channel, we can now see that the difference is approximately 2.1 million,
2193180	2196180	there's a reason for that, and I think I've explained it.
2196180	2201180	Grade never really abruptly lost any of his momentum, because many people adored his style,
2201180	2206180	to the point where he could probably just spend a whole video farting, and it would crack a million views,
2206180	2209180	but from his perspective, it probably drained him.
2209180	2214180	Also, the new copyright system hasn't helped his videos, with many of them being claimed retrospectively
2214180	2216180	due to his use of music in transitions.
2216180	2222180	All in all, I can see these instances being fairly demotivating for a creator who fed off excitement.
2222180	2227180	Grade is just another casualty of the drama, regardless of whether he was right or wrong,
2227180	2234180	none of the creators who were really there in the midst of that 2016 mess, are really doing it with the same passion.
2234180	2239180	H3 has taken hiatus on his channel, spoke about being drained, we all know what happened to Leafy,
2239180	2245180	and although iDubbbz has arguably become the kingmaker of commentary, he hasn't made a content cop in a while,
2245180	2250180	and he doesn't really talk about it, and there are rumours that he doesn't really enjoy its legacy.
2250180	2255180	I mean, I wouldn't either, that's a huge weight to deliver some world destroying criticism.
2255180	2261180	The only person who really came out happy was Keemstar, and that's because he's insane and lives off drama,
2261180	2263180	and creates it when there isn't any.
2263180	2268180	Grade burned everyone in his path, and then stood in the ashes and asked what happened,
2268180	2271180	and that's why I don't ever think he'll fully stick around,
2271180	2276180	because Grade is a person who became reliant on the environment to power his content from,
2276180	2280180	Reddit to Drama Alert, and now he's just another guy making videos.
2280180	2286180	Even if they pull views, he's gonna have trouble building a community because many creators don't trust him,
2286180	2288180	and he probably doesn't trust them either.
2288180	2293180	The days of old commentary are over, and Grade just doesn't belong, and that's a shame,
2293180	2297180	because his content did have value, with retrospect to my previous video.
2297180	2301180	I think it's fair to say that there are many elements that caused the rise of Grade,
2301180	2307180	but ultimately, it was the drama that caused the fall. I don't know if he'll ever get that back.
2307180	2311180	With that said, I don't think there is an animosity to reflect upon his content with.
2311180	2314180	I think he didn't always handle things with the right demeanour,
2314180	2318180	and he was definitely sucked into an addiction that ultimately left him worse for wear,
2318180	2325180	but he still had a great cultural impact on the site, and his content is still important to this day,
2325180	2329180	for many, many reasons, and you can't take that away from him.
2329180	2335180	So, as much as this is a discussion, a discourse, a critique, it's also a tribute,
2335180	2341180	because there is no one quite like Grade A Under Ray, and I don't think there ever will be.
2343180	2347180	So that was the video rounding off the two part series.
2347180	2349180	I really hope you guys enjoyed it.
2349180	2353180	Definitely some of the longer stuff again, being the fact that I had to split it into two parts.
2353180	2357180	I would love to hear any thoughts in the comments section below, really interesting discussion.
