1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
So whatever happened to that Grade A Under A fella?

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,720
If you piss off Grade A Under A, he's gonna do whatever he can to ruin you.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,560
Grade like all of us is a liar.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,840
There's a different standard for you.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,520
It wouldn't be the first time you've lied, because basically you've lied a lot of times, mate.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,320
And there's a different standard for Grade A Under A, and he will ruin you if he can.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,360
too much free time, and today we continue the story of Grade A Under A.

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,280
If you haven't watched part 1, I would highly recommend doing so, because many of the narratives

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,880
that we discussed today are rooted in the previous video, however to aid continuity's

11
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,080
sake, we join our story less than a year after Grey's channel was resuscitated through

12
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,080
a Reddit post.

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,000
He had turned his content into some of the most unique and marketable work on YouTube,

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,180
and was approaching the peak of his career.

15
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,720
He was stepping effortlessly between his drama and non-drama content, and gaining support

16
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,360
at an unassailable rate.

17
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,980
The sudden interest in an actual genre that could generate its own content whilst simultaneously

18
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,440
being able to comment on it definitely had its appeals, and being a person of strong,

19
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,100
unmitigated sentiments, Grade had found his rhythm.

20
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,620
His content picked up to an unbelievable pace at around mid-January of 2016, just after

21
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,780
the release of his second Nicole Arber video, in which he breaks down Arber's side of

22
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,260
her abuse story against Matthew Santoro, and exposes some rather glowing inconsistencies

23
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,660
within her testimony, but equally as quick as he took off, he was to encounter his fair

24
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,620
share of drama, the tables were about to turn.

25
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,220
His first warning of this should have come with a very small YouTuber by the name of

26
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,220
Reactor.

27
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,220
Reactor is a satire channel who parodied a lot of larger reaction channels.

28
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,380
Now Reactor had barely 30 subscribers, and therefore basically posed no threat, but he

29
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,700
decided that given Grade's rather outspoken position on reaction channels, he'd meddle

30
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,660
a little on Grade's own channel.

31
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,980
Now this is where we harken back to Grade's Vegan Gains video, because in the Vegan Gains

32
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:14,460
video, what Grade did was remix Vegan Gains' words and turn it into this wacky, hilarious

33
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,460
parody.

34
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,140
Grade did much of the same, but did it more convincingly because Grade doesn't show his

35
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,020
face, and therefore if you weren't paying attention, the difference in tone may have

36
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,020
gone over your head.

37
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,020
Grade- One of my favourite YouTube channels is Reactor, right?

38
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,900
Despite what they say, this guy is fucking genius.

39
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,540
Your videos do show your reactions, but they're fucking genius, right?

40
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,540
That was genius, man.

41
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,140
That was a really nice touch to the video.

42
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,140
Literally over 95% genius.

43
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,620
That's something to be proud of.

44
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,140
It's still pretty obvious, but maybe some of the younger audience failed to detect the

45
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:52,160
contrast in tone and audio quality, so Reactor uploaded this and then paid a few hundred

46
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,140
to have the video shown as an ad before Grade's videos, basically fooling a few naive people

47
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,420
into thinking that Grade had given Reactor a shoutout.

48
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,060
He then gave this video extra publicity, and even more ironically, by using the reddit

49
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,800
system to promote the documentation of his little project.

50
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,860
It was a pretty genius prank.

51
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,340
Fortunately, Grade didn't find it too funny, not just leaving multiple rather vexed comments

52
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,780
on Reactor's video, but then subsequently bringing it up in a future video when discussing

53
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,780
the situation.

54
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,220
Grade- I've also had some guy use my copyrighted material to put together a fake advert for

55
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,340
himself which deceived and fooled a bunch of people into subscribing to it.

56
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,240
And although this certainly didn't lead to much at the time, it should have been foreshadowing

57
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,220
that Grade wasn't quite the critic that he had sculpted.

58
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,500
That sort of attitude doesn't really wash with a channel that's a fraction of his

59
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,540
size, and clearly taking the piss.

60
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,340
And make no mistake, it was blatant bait, but so was Grade's video on Vegan Gains.

61
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,500
The difference with Reactor's video is if Grade takes the bait, he proves Reactor's

62
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
point.

63
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,040
Grade- I think I get it now, you fuck with other YouTube channels to create controversy,

64
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,720
and then when people start fucking with you, you cry for sympathy.

65
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,740
Now I don't entirely agree with the point that Grade blew up solely off drama, it's

66
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:07,960
clear he had some very interesting components to his character beyond that, but by being

67
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,060
angry at someone over something that many people would agree isn't a big deal, and

68
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:31,340
lambasting behaviours that he'd previously overlooked and even indulged in himself, it

69
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,760
showed him up as lacking some self-awareness, and self-awareness is one of the essentials

70
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,120
to delivering criticism.

71
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,500
This wasn't a big deal, but it was a warning, a warning that was not heeded, unfortunately.

72
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,960
Now as the year progressed we started to see more drama, and this led to various creators

73
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,760
weighing in specific situations.

74
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,600
One of the most significant movements was the larger YouTuber movement against drama,

75
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,220
made by people such as Markiplier, PewDiePie, and Matthew Santoro, basically criticising

76
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,600
the drama that had been going on within the community, because it was fairly recognisable

77
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
at that point.

78
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,720
Grade was a fairly staunch defender though of the drama, because it probably gave him

79
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,400
views, but likely because he was on good terms with two people, Leafy and Keemstar, people

80
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,680
who benefited off drama greatly.

81
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,560
Grade always had a way of turning response videos, even if they made valid points into

82
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,760
exposed videos of their own, and his response video to the drama was no different, as at

83
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,220
the end he inserted a little part exposing Matthew Santoro for allegedly plagiarising

84
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:45,700
content.

85
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,040
Now it wasn't relevant to the points that he was making with regards to the video, but

86
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,300
Grade wanted to survive, and it served as a spicy side dish, and really impacted Santoro's

87
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,780
ability to speak on matters again, and like the cute little double team they are, Drama

88
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,380
Alert reported it later on.

89
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:10,580
And now for our final story, today GradeAUnderA uploaded a video calling three YouTubers,

90
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:16,960
PewDiePie, Markiplier, and Matthew Santoro, on their drama videos, but towards the end

91
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:24,780
of the video, Matthew Santoro got it the worse, as GradeAUnderA exposed him, exposed him,

92
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,780
for plagiarism.

93
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,460
This is all important information, in a Reddit Q&A on March the 3rd, someone asked Grade for

94
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,520
his opinion on Keemstar, Grade replied that he liked him, and that he's genuinely been

95
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,520
nothing but nice to him from the start, he has no reason to hate him at all.

96
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,300
Grade loved drama, so it was only natural that he was going to love someone who supported

97
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,500
that cycle, and Keemstar probably loved him for the exact same reasons.

98
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,660
Grade would appear on Drama Alert and regularly interact with Papa Keem, however as the year

99
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,860
progressed you got the feeling that Grade involved himself with drama for the sake of

100
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,420
it being drama, rather than the fact that he actually felt strongly about these things,

101
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,760
and when there were actual reputations of his associates at stake, he had a habit of

102
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,580
going a bit quiet, such as the Leafy rant.

103
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:14,140
Keemstar reported on it, offered H3 and Leafy a way to hash it out, Grade didn't really

104
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,980
say much other than pulling the plug on a planned podcast between him, Leafy, and Sky

105
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:24,020
Williams after having a serious conversation which they would rather not talk about.

106
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:29,220
That situation was to become extremely messy in no time at all, but Leafy eventually emerged

107
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,660
in just about one piece, partly due to the unity inspired by the Matt Hoss situation.

108
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:39,380
But then barely two months later, the tables turned once more, when the man himself, iDubbbz,

109
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:44,860
released a fairly comprehensive content cop on Keemstar, making him practically indefensible,

110
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,560
and suddenly the drama came very close to home.

111
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,780
But there wasn't a rush of responses immediately, no, this was to come in June, with videos

112
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,400
from other creators like Pyrocynical also garnering impressive amounts of views.

113
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,540
It's one of his most viewed to this day.

114
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,760
The Leafy shark caught a scent of blood and decided to move in on his old pal, and going

115
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,660
into battle alongside him was the man himself, Grade A under A. Keemstar seemed to be the

116
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,060
easiest target on the platform, he was bleeding subs, and you would be very hard pressed to

117
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:18,280
find his fanbase outside of his own comment section, and there was a genuine expectation

118
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,020
for his child to just collapse at any moment.

119
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,660
However, at this moment, the moment where everything seemed the easiest, the drama would

120
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,660
bring them far too close to the sun.

121
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,260
Now, I obviously mentioned during my previous part what Grade said in his Reddit post about Keemstar.

122
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,540
To summarise, he has conducted some fairly questionable actions, but at the end of it

123
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:52,980
he's been nothing but supportive of him and his work, and helped expand his channel and stand up for his content.

124
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:58,320
So with the sudden tidal wave of hatred going towards Keem, with his channel haemorrhaging subscribers,

125
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
what position would Grade take?

126
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,780
That doesn't sound so supportive.

127
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,620
Now that clips from his second part, but the first part is no less brutal.

128
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:20,420
For context, with his old pal Leafy turning fairly viciously on Keem, Grade found himself

129
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:25,860
back in the crossfire, but a fairly one-sided crossfire at that, with Leafy's video allegedly

130
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,980
nailing Keem down for his behaviour.

131
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,140
The thing is that Leafy's video really pulls Grade into it and ties him in that future

132
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,340
position that he has to take.

133
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,540
This was probably done with some coordination, they're in this together, and this is important,

134
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,300
I want you to hold this point in your head for later.

135
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,340
And Killer Keemstar is pretty much the most hated man on the internet right now.

136
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,420
So many exposed videos have been made on this guy, right?

137
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,820
But they do nothing to him, he's the cockroach of YouTube, he keeps fucking surviving.

138
00:09:53,820 --> 00:10:00,900
But listen, hopefully that'll end with this organised attack that's been going on over the past week or two.

139
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,140
Basically, the setting of Grade's two videos was that he was hoping he could be part of

140
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,780
this extremely organised campaign to remove Keemstar from the platform altogether.

141
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:14,580
He had noticed that there had been a run of videos made on him, and thought that he could finish him off.

142
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,780
A lot of his points were about Keem's behaviour, claims such as doxing, false pedophile allegations,

143
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:25,380
hypocrisy, exploitation, the victim card, racism, harassment, and domestic abuse.

144
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,380
Some of these were not like claims at all, and would have serious repercussions.

145
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:35,380
Grade listed them off to prove a point, that Keemstar is someone who should never be given any platform whatsoever.

146
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,180
As exposed videos go, it's comprehensive for sure.

147
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:43,180
Some claims were fairly well substantiated and convincing, others a bit more risky,

148
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:48,980
and certainly should have been more thoroughly researched, such as pedophile or domestic abuse allegations.

149
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,580
I'm not sure they would have passed in today's environment.

150
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:55,180
But who cared? People were dunking on Keemstar left, right, and centre,

151
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:59,380
and if there was a bit of collateral damage done, well, karma, right?

152
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:04,380
His child was on his way down anyway, it wasn't like he was going to come back from this.

153
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,980
At the end of the video, Grade endorses Keem's number one competitor, Scarce,

154
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,380
saying that he's been killing it recently.

155
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,380
This was an attempt to make Keem irrelevant, and having a news source on the website

156
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,180
that covered drama and didn't instigate it.

157
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,180
This video won over a lot of people, and it still wins over people to this day,

158
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,780
and I can understand why, but with all the information that I had researched with regards to this,

159
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:33,780
I couldn't help but feel a bit uncomfortable when Grade was going off about how anyone could support him,

160
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,980
when he'd been supporting him less than a few months before.

161
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,180
Now, what you could say is that he was ignorant to certain incidents,

162
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:45,180
and the unearthing of these incidents in the following months had shifted his position.

163
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,980
But it's hard to fully believe that perspective when certain examples arise,

164
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:55,580
such as his false pedo allegation against the YouTuber RSGloryandGold that happened in around January 2016.

165
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:00,180
Now, everyone knew about that, but Grade seems pretty harsh in how he frames it,

166
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:06,780
and even as a former friend, it's hard to process that someone would turn so brutally out of genuine sentiment,

167
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:11,980
to the point that they would knowingly run on very shaky abuse and pedophilia allegations.

168
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:17,980
It doesn't feel real, and let me make it clear, I've turned on people when I think that they haven't learned their lesson,

169
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:24,380
but many of these examples are years old, and the logic implied through much of this is that the person that Grade was supportive of

170
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:29,980
is suddenly undermined by his old behaviour, and there are definitely claims that aren't undone by age,

171
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,780
but they're normally the ones with the least substantiation.

172
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:36,780
I find most of Grade's claims, as someone who is a former friend of Keemstar,

173
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:41,780
to either fall into the category of things that Grade definitely knew about and probably acknowledged,

174
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,580
things that were so old that they could be undone by present experience,

175
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,780
or things that are lacking evidence or necessary context.

176
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:53,180
There are expectations to this, and Keem was deserving of a lot of criticism,

177
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:59,780
but it felt much like a bandwagon on their part, and in a way, the Keemstar drama would be the escalation of the year,

178
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,980
and once you reach a climax, you're only setting yourself up for disappointment.

179
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:09,980
And so that's what you saw, a gradual tail-off until September, at which point, of course,

180
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:15,980
iDubbbz dropped his content cop on Leafy, and there was once again an immediate effect.

181
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:21,780
Now, I could talk about iDubbbz's content cop forever, there's a lot to say about it, and it's probably better that I save that,

182
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:28,780
but the real telling effect of it is that it hit Grade too, even though he only made one very brief appearance in it.

183
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:35,780
Grade, he said a bunch of, uh, critical shit of Keemstar, but then on top of that, he couldn't just leave it there.

184
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,580
He had to say that Scarce is killing him recently.

185
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,580
Go subscribe to Scarce!

186
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:47,580
Don't subscribe to Scarce. I know I'm months behind on this one, but subscribe to Scarce when his content gets better.

187
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,780
Scarce is overweight, but more importantly than that, Scarce is boring.

188
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:56,380
Grade A and Leafy, complete fucking retards. Actual retards.

189
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,180
Yo, is this person fucking retarded?

190
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:58,780
Yes.

191
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,580
Yo, is this person fucking retarded?

192
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,180
Yes.

193
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:07,180
However, I think the moment that broke both Leafy and Grade's credibility was this part.

194
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:13,180
If Keemstar's a rat, then Leafy is a fucking snake. Greasy, slimy, slithery cunt.

195
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:21,180
And I say both Leafy and Grade's credibility because, as I mentioned earlier, Leafy and Grade tied themselves together in that drama,

196
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,380
that personal experience with Keemstar.

197
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:27,180
iDubbbz's quote calling Leafy Egg Snake is no less applicable to Grade.

198
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:32,380
Both of them purposely distanced themselves from someone who they knew much better than they let on,

199
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,580
and even if the criticisms were legitimate, you turn it back on them and say,

200
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:41,180
well, why did they associate themselves with him in the first place if they were aware of this?

201
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:46,180
iDubbbz, in a very short amount of time, revealed Leafy and Grade for the Fairweather friends that they were.

202
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:51,180
iDubbbz's video also came out at a time where the hype around Grade's channel was rather low.

203
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:57,980
There was a significant lack of drama occurring, and iDubbbz had the chance to really halt whatever momentum they had, and he did.

204
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:04,180
Grade lost 3,500 subscribers on the day of the video, and this wasn't going to ease up in the following weeks.

205
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:10,980
A lot of people wonder why iDubbbz's video hit Grade, and in particular Leafy, so much that it caused long-term damage.

206
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:18,180
Well, partly because their appeal was based on their credibility as creators, and iDubbbz fundamentally managed to undermine that.

207
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:24,180
Equally, iDubbbz is a person with such a clearly defined moral compass, regardless of whether you agree with him or not,

208
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,180
it makes it very hard to turn around to him and try and lecture him on anything.

209
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:34,180
Grade once again found himself in the crossfire, with the person he went into battle with now taking significant flak.

210
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,180
How could he respond?

211
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,180
Well, let's discuss that.

212
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:52,180
There was this expectation that given that he was called out by iDubbbz, he would respond alongside Leafy,

213
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:57,180
and with the information given today, and the way he's behaved, it really shouldn't surprise us.

214
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:03,180
With that said, even if you think your friend might have done some stupid shit, if you were genuinely invested in their future,

215
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,180
you'd still probably make a case that they could learn from this, and we should move forward.

216
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:14,180
But Grade chose not to. No one was entitled to a defence, and sometimes the best thing to do in these circumstances is just to say nothing at all.

217
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,180
But still, that's not exactly what he did.

218
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:23,180
Now, after the first day, his subscriber count didn't necessarily bleed like Leafy's, but it did stagnate,

219
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:28,180
and whether that was motivation for Grade to make a video on it or not is another question,

220
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,180
but regardless of the question, he did receive an answer.

221
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:35,180
So let's talk about the videos that prolonged his suffering.

222
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:39,180
The thing is, the video that he made isn't actually to do with the drama,

223
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:44,180
it's more to do with how he's felt drained, and uninspired, and something that we all feel.

224
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:49,180
However, I can understand why a lot of people interpreted this as a victim card.

225
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:56,180
If you believe Grade was rather calculated and cynical, then this would be the best way to gain sympathy from an unsuspecting audience,

226
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,180
without necessarily responding to claims.

227
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:06,180
As we've all seen, many people with legitimate reason thought it was in Grade's nature to not be the most honest in his videos.

228
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:11,180
With that said, it wouldn't surprise me if Grade did legitimately feel fed up of making videos.

229
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:16,180
The hype had died, the drama alongside it. It was a sad time for his content.

230
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:23,180
It was also, in a way, his own doing. He contributed to that culture, and I'm sure he was aware of that.

231
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:28,180
When you lose your excitement and your enthusiasm for making videos, you don't feel that urge to go that extra mile,

232
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:34,180
to make the video go from just good to amazing, and it ends up just being meh instead, do you know what I mean?

233
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,180
And because of that, the videos start to suffer.

234
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:42,180
And what struck me about this video is that on reflection, over the spell of 2016,

235
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:48,180
particularly in the three or four months in reference, the videos became significantly less comedic in their delivery.

236
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,180
And this is where we bring back my first part of this very lengthy saga,

237
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,180
where he spoke about what made his videos quite entertaining.

238
00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:00,180
No longer was there that attention to detail, those comedic pauses, that feeling of build-up,

239
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:06,180
but more just a continuous flow of rants, and because of that, it kind of killed any sort of tension that may lead to laughs.

240
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:12,180
And as I mentioned, a joke is much more than just its punchline, and I feel that Grade lost that.

241
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:16,180
And although it wasn't like he didn't have good jokes, it was just that they didn't land as well.

242
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:21,180
Especially my last video, right? I wasn't happy with that video at all, but I still felt like I had to upload it.

243
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,180
Why did they skip Vitamins B, 8, 10, and 11?

244
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:31,180
And fog-skipping those numbers, that wouldn't even be an issue in the first place, had you not called them all Vitamin B!

245
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:35,180
Especially when there are empty slots for Vitamins F through J.

246
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:42,180
It sometimes felt like he'd lost awareness of how he had set his character up, in that semi-satirical fashion of the judgmental prick.

247
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:47,180
His more modern content seemed to lack that irony, and maybe this was due to the drama,

248
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:51,180
which led Grade to making much more serious videos that relied on conveying credibility.

249
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:56,180
Up until this situation, we constantly let comedy get in the way of actual points.

250
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:00,180
A great example would have been the PewDiePie, Markiplier, Santoro response video.

251
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:07,180
There were a ton of ad hominems there, and we almost just completely overlooked them because they were part of Grade's character,

252
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,180
but both of those sides were becoming dangerously integrated.

253
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,180
In his latest video, is Grade overreacting to drama as a joke?

254
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:18,180
Is it the same Grade who ranted about interviews as a gag,

255
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:24,180
or is it a new Grade who wants us to take his word seriously while still keeping up the same tone and demeanor?

256
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,180
And how can you just go from one persona like that to the other?

257
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,180
H3 is an example of people who can do that, or did that,

258
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:37,180
because they knew how to differentiate their style between their regular humorous content and their serious videos,

259
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,180
which called out YouTube and YouTubers alike.

260
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:46,180
Grade didn't do that, and maybe because he couldn't see the vast difference between his drama-related content and his more casual videos.

261
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,180
Maybe it didn't occur to him, but there was a difference,

262
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:53,180
and it was pulling him into a position that he couldn't afford to maintain.

263
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,180
Because drama doesn't last, your character does,

264
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:00,180
and if you build a persona off drama, or you let it be influenced by it,

265
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:04,180
then when the drama dies, your shortcomings will be exposed as a crater.

266
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,180
And that was the problem with Grade's drama videos,

267
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:11,180
it was all created on the basis of its content, and not really the person talking,

268
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,180
who really wasn't that reasonable as a persona.

269
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:21,180
Drama drained Grade's personality, and then when he tried to reapply it to his regular content, it didn't feel the same.

270
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:28,180
Grade's first video mainly caused a loss in subscribers because it felt like it was a very indirect way to respond to the content cop,

271
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,180
and I can't look into Grade's mind and see what he was thinking,

272
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,180
but I do see it as a bit too good to be a coincidence,

273
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,180
that he would release such a video in the circumstances.

274
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:41,180
However, he wasn't finished. Throughout the weeks following the content cop,

275
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:46,180
there was significant backlash from a few creators, such as Sinnoh, Quentin Reviews and Tommy C.

276
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:51,180
These creators brought a variety of different points to the table, some more valid than others,

277
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:58,180
and for the first time, Grade was staring down serious criticism, and serious allegations. How would he respond?

278
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:03,180
Listen, some of these allegations are fucking crazy, so I didn't see any reason to address them, right?

279
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,180
But as it turns out, some people actually believe in them!

280
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:12,180
Seriously though, YouTube's not the site that it used to be. It has gone from this, to this.

281
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:17,180
People are desperate for drama, so I need to quickly address all the allegations in this video,

282
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:23,180
before they start getting out of hand, and I'm being accused of planning 9-11, and being in the fucking Illuminati.

283
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:28,180
Right, with all the context now, of this video, you can't even begin to comprehend the irony of this.

284
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:32,180
A person who was more than happy to make weak claims against someone else,

285
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:36,180
is now outraged that other people are making weak claims against him.

286
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,180
Once again, some are valid, some are not.

287
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:43,180
But then he has the audacity to pull this YouTube isn't the same anymore card,

288
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,180
despite being a torchbearer for drama.

289
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:52,180
The video comprises of him responding to a few claims, most of them straw manned in a way that made it easier for him to respond to them,

290
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,180
because that's what you can do when you're the person acting as your own critic.

291
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:01,180
And yes, sometimes it can be entertaining or funny, but it should be acknowledged as a comedic measure,

292
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,180
not an actual argumentation strategy.

293
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:09,180
Well you know what I heard? I heard Greyde is a pedophile!

294
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:15,180
And this video is where I think the wheels really started to come off the Grey Train. Let's explain why.

295
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:27,180
I've always said, being able to respond to drama is an essential aspect of participating in drama.

296
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:33,180
Greyde's response may have worked at the time, with his fanbase, but in retrospect it does not hold up at all,

297
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:37,180
not in my opinion at least, especially with the context considered.

298
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:43,180
He said some insanely racist shit against minorities, and I'm a minority myself,

299
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:48,180
and people say it's a business decision. These are words that came from his mouth, and his mouth alone.

300
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:56,180
So if I don't stick by my racist friend and tickle his balls while he makes racist statements about a group of people that I myself belong to,

301
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,180
that's backstabbing, is it?

302
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:08,180
I'm sorry, as racist as what Keem said was, it bemuses me to think that Greyde had only just found this years old content out

303
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:17,180
and at that point, after everything, decided to break off a friendship of which he had described Keemstar as nothing but supportive of him,

304
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:24,180
rather than confronting Keem about his transgressions. By comparing Keem to a member of the KKK,

305
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:30,180
it just shows how redundant these arguments are, and completely dismissive of all context.

306
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:35,180
It's quite funny how some people only care about racism when they can use it to prove a point.

307
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,180
I mean, you could literally have a logical, fassy day out here.

308
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,180
He starts off with the strawman,

309
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:52,180
then he makes a false equivalence, before gaslighting his critics, implying they've been manipulated.

310
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:04,180
He then responds to the allegation that he inspired a million dollar lawsuit against Matthew Santoro,

311
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:09,180
which should be an easy thing to respond to, I mean, no one has any evidence of that.

312
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:14,180
Just say it's not true, and that didn't happen, and the burden of proof is on your critics,

313
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,180
but he takes it down this very bizarre route.

314
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:24,180
He's an online cartoonist who can barely draw, yet despite this, I apparently encouraged a large company

315
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,180
to file a million dollar lawsuit against someone.

316
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:31,180
Guys, he's an online cartoonist who can barely draw.

317
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:36,180
He has no influence, bar the 3 million subscribers of course, but don't mention them.

318
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:41,180
Like, why would you say that? I'm a guy who speaks into his microphone and lives in a one room flat.

319
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,180
What influence do I have, guys? Don't listen to me.

320
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:49,180
Now, I don't necessarily believe the claim, but to respond to the claim saying that you don't have influence

321
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,180
is a weird way to respond.

322
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:56,180
He then basically spends the next part of the video working out how to disassociate him from the narrative

323
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,180
that grouped him and Leafy together.

324
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,180
Fuck you, grade, you and Leafy-

325
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:08,180
Listen, like I said, right, I am not Leafy. I honestly cannot fucking believe that I'm having to explain this, right?

326
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:15,180
But this guy is not this guy, and I'm getting dragged into drama that has nothing to do with me because of this.

327
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:22,180
Like for example, right, during the iDubbbz and LeafyIsHair drama, despite me being neither of these two YouTubers,

328
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:25,180
some people expected me to get involved in this drama for some reason.

329
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:28,180
Essentially trying to untie the anchor from his ankle.

330
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:34,180
Despite the fact that he was boasting in his original video on Keem, this was very clearly an organised attack,

331
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:38,180
and joking about the actual vocal association in other videos.

332
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:45,180
But listen, hopefully that'll end with this organised attack that's been going on over the past week or two.

333
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:51,180
First Pyrocynical, then Leafy, and now I'm making a video on Keemstar.

334
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,180
Listen, I don't want to make a big deal out of this, right?

335
00:25:53,180 --> 00:26:01,180
But this many YouTubers of this size making videos calling out Keemstar realistically will not happen again, right?

336
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:07,180
If you hate Keemstar, this is your one chance to get rid of him. So make it count.

337
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:10,180
You can't pretend that never happens.

338
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:16,180
What is there to say? I could go on and on about this response video, but in my opinion it is fairly terrible,

339
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:21,180
and although it still received moderate support at the time, he was digging his own grave.

340
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,180
With this video came another hit to subs.

341
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:28,180
The sharks were circling, he was called out publicly for some meltdowns that happened in the months prior,

342
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,180
some on Reddit, some on stream.

343
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:36,180
Go read that comment, go tell that fucking whore that's a mod on my fucking subreddit to link you to what I said to delete.

344
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,180
Go tell it to link it, it's not bad at all.

345
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:44,180
But why? Why was this happening? This person who had literally forgot his channel existed at one point,

346
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:52,180
who clearly didn't consider YouTube a big deal, was now being perceived as this megalomania, and not without evidence.

347
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:59,180
Well, I guess it's just the rabbit hole that sometimes people fall down, and in a way, we all fell down it with him,

348
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:03,180
because he was one of the original guys who went after these creators and exposed them.

349
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:10,180
Vegan Gains, Nicole Arber, even Ray William Johnson, but at the same time, they weren't the hardest people to go after,

350
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:16,180
they were targets for whom we didn't really care how they were treated, just that they were sorted out for one reason or another.

351
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:22,180
We wanted them gone, and now Grey has serious criticism facing him down, his responses just won't work,

352
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:28,180
because he's going against people who haven't established enough of a reputation to be hated.

353
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:35,180
The problem is, when we support people who argue in the way that Grey did, even to people we passionately hate,

354
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:41,180
even to people we view as terrible human beings, we risk them turning around and turning their hoards on the wrong person,

355
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:46,180
on a person who might just be a victim of mentality, with the same approach that we've endorsed.

356
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:52,180
There are plenty of positions that I hate, there are people that I dislike, but at the end of the day,

357
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:58,180
as cathartic and as tempting as it is to just go after someone's credibility, it's a risky measure long term.

358
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:03,180
You risk influencing people to adopt that philosophy of discounting someone on a trivial basis,

359
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:09,180
and even if you can wield that power properly and work out when someone should get it or when someone shouldn't,

360
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:14,180
you're working with people who themselves are not as careful. On top of this, you're promoting a market

361
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:20,180
in which it's successful to behave that way, which will create clones who are less nuanced than yourself.

362
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:25,180
Now I want to make it very clear, we are allowed to make fun of each other, we are allowed to make fun of other commentators,

363
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:34,180
even if the joke is lined in a level of cynicism, but mockery of someone's credibility is not a sufficient substitute for a point,

364
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:38,180
maybe complementary in some instances, but not as a substitute.

365
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:44,180
Grade was successful because his persona often disguised how some of his videos did tend to lack validity,

366
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:49,180
not necessarily to what he was saying, but to the discussion that was trying to be had.

367
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:56,180
Look at the Matthew Santoro video, and when he didn't have the arguments, he'd substitute them for more fallacies,

368
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:00,180
with a tone that implied authority, but never really earned it.

369
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:08,180
So, with this all in mind, Grade's sort of empire was coming to an end. Two incidents, two sub-drops,

370
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:15,180
and a third time, he would've been a fool to make the same mistake, so I guess for him it was time to move on.

371
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:20,180
And he did. But what did he move on to exactly? Well, let's find out.

372
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:33,180
So with all this behind him, Grade decided to turn back to the lighthearted genre of politics.

373
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:40,180
Yes, now remember, this is towards the back end of 2016, and that means it was at the presidential election time,

374
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:44,180
Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were battling it out for the White House.

375
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:49,180
Grade decided to cover this topic more meticulously than any of his previous situations,

376
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,180
releasing a total of five videos, initiating with a critique of Casey Neistat,

377
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:59,180
following interviews of both the main presidential candidates, an analysis of the American voting system,

378
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:05,180
and concluding with a review of the reaction to, spoiler alert, Donald Trump's victory.

379
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:11,180
The videos themselves were fine enough, I guess. He did go a bit more in-depth on Clinton, mind you,

380
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:17,180
though I guess it made sense, because he likes to make exposed videos, and there's more for you to actually expose with Hillary,

381
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:24,180
Donald Trump just continuously exposed himself, makes his job less fun, and he does in the end lend support to Sanders and Stein,

382
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:28,180
so he certainly wasn't necessarily being sympathetic to either of the main candidates.

383
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:34,180
Beyond that, the videos aren't particularly bad in their points, though it was certainly interesting to see someone like Grade

384
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:40,180
talking about politics, not without their jokes in the delivery of course, but the points were all fairly serious.

385
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:46,180
Now after this, he had his last really well performing video on people who hate video games,

386
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:51,180
well performing for his size, of course, I mean, a lot of people dream of his consistent view count.

387
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:56,180
After that, however, the views were fairly standard. He then returned to his more comedic style,

388
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:02,180
and actually I think he was being fairly funny again. His arguments were more based in common sense than previous,

389
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:08,180
and his tone had become a lot more uniform, just that one very angry guy, but he had some good jokes that would

390
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,180
play off the rage fairly well, and did have some flow.

391
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:17,180
I know I made a video a little while ago defending video games right, but despite how much I fucking love them right,

392
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:23,180
there are some things I do find kind of annoying about them. Nothing big though, just a few small complaints.

393
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:28,180
That made me want to throw my fucking controller through the TV.

394
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:33,180
Maybe the drama dragged him down, and now he's out of it, he felt a bit more liberated, but at the same time,

395
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:39,180
it also meant he lost a lot of support that came from the more drama oriented fans who'd moved on to creators

396
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:46,180
who were more associated with trending topics. By 2017, none of the new videos really cracked the ceiling of 2 million views

397
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:52,180
after a video game upload, however, on the other hand, his drama videos were unlikely to do as well as they previously did,

398
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:58,180
because the drama kinda died, and he had distanced himself from it. In fact, following the political videos,

399
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:04,180
the only time he really covered drama again was in the PewDiePie vs Wall Street Journal video, which was extremely late to the party,

400
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:10,180
later than me. In a way, he'd split his audience down the middle, and there was no longer that guaranteed interest

401
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:15,180
in what he spoke about. There were better commentary channels taking on the drama topics,

402
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,180
but at least he had his more casual rant topics, right?

403
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:24,180
Well, 2016 was the year of the storytime animators who really began taking on the qualms of daily life,

404
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:30,180
and other topics in a similar field, providing Grade with real competition, and squeezing his market.

405
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:35,180
People had noticed the fertile grounds and started farming, and Grade didn't really change it up,

406
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:41,180
and in a way, could he? He still did fine for himself, but I guess even when you're doing well,

407
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:45,180
it can feel like you're going nowhere, if it doesn't feel like progress.

408
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:51,180
Grade was never a celebrity, he never had droves of people following him around every time he left his house,

409
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:56,180
and that was his choice, for many reasons I think are likely sensible and justified.

410
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:01,180
But one thing that I've noticed is that when you're not public, your life seems fairly ordinary,

411
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:06,180
even with whatever success you're experiencing, you're not witnessing the real world repercussions

412
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:11,180
of the content you make because you're still behind a screen. This can often alienate you from the impact

413
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:16,180
of your content and even its success. Being a YouTuber really hasn't been much of a rush for me,

414
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:21,180
because I haven't really changed my life at all, mainly because I want to finish my education,

415
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:26,180
and so my lifestyle hasn't really altered beyond the fact that I spend most of my free time on YouTube,

416
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:31,180
driving myself insane. I have a hunch that even with his success, Grade never really experienced it

417
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:37,180
because he kept himself away from that world. I don't think that's a bad thing, but I do think it can lead

418
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:43,180
to someone taking hiatus because it doesn't give them any satisfaction in return, and after PewDiePie vs

419
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:49,180
Wall Street Journal video in March 2017, Grade did just that, he fell off the map.

420
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:56,180
Until a few months later in May 2017, when Grade uploaded another video, implying that he was coming back,

421
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:01,180
his hand coming from the grave, and announcing that there would be more YouTube videos and Twitch streams,

422
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:07,180
with the audience's heart in his hands. This led to absolutely nothing for another two months, until

423
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:14,180
when Grade announced his return in a much more elaborate video, and announcing that this would be the start of Season 2.

424
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:33,180
In his video, he announces how he plans to go back to his more grassroots comedy, as it used to be,

425
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:39,180
how he realised that pleasing the algorithms and merely appealing to trending topics just leads you to hating

426
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:45,180
your general experience as a YouTuber, and why he was not going to conform to it. He also rants about how

427
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:51,180
Jake Paul is ruining the site and driving all creativity down with it, he says he's been working on videos

428
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:57,180
since the week before his upload, so understandably many people were excited to see what he was going to bring

429
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:02,180
to his next video, if we ever received a next video, which we didn't for a long, long time.

430
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:07,180
I don't think Grade was trolling when he uploaded his return videos, it would be a pretty funny troll,

431
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:12,180
but I think it was very probable that he did have trouble being in the mood to record his content,

432
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:18,180
and finding that recipe that worked for him all the times before. Drama is a rush, when you're involved in it,

433
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:23,180
and you have the power to end careers, it's like you're Thanos with the Infinity Stones, and then it's gone,

434
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:28,180
and you can't recapture that, and sometimes when people can't do that, they just lose faith.

435
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:33,180
Normal content is a rhythm, and to find that you have to have a grip on what you're creating,

436
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:38,180
a rush will disrupt that rhythm. Grade did eventually return, at the start of this year,

437
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:44,180
we all had the sinking feeling that he wouldn't stick around, because although the hype for him was here,

438
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:49,180
it was more an anticipation about his return, rather than actually investing in his content.

439
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:54,180
His return video performed excellently, the videos following it, not so much.

440
00:35:54,180 --> 00:36:00,180
Do I think Grade regrets the drama? Maybe he does, at the time I can see why it's so enticing to get involved,

441
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:06,180
but looking back on it, his content that had the most longevity are the videos that aren't on drama,

442
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:12,180
the content that is just about everyone's daily lives, because people's lives aren't going to be changing soon,

443
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:17,180
at least I don't think they are, and therefore, when you make content about that, it's always relevant,

444
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:20,180
no matter their demographic, or the time that they're watching the video.

445
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:26,180
Back when this screenshot was taken at the start of 2017, you can see that the difference between these two videos

446
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:33,180
is around 100,000 views, and yet returning to his channel, we can now see that the difference is approximately 2.1 million,

447
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,180
there's a reason for that, and I think I've explained it.

448
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:41,180
Grade never really abruptly lost any of his momentum, because many people adored his style,

449
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:46,180
to the point where he could probably just spend a whole video farting, and it would crack a million views,

450
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,180
but from his perspective, it probably drained him.

451
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:54,180
Also, the new copyright system hasn't helped his videos, with many of them being claimed retrospectively

452
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,180
due to his use of music in transitions.

453
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:02,180
All in all, I can see these instances being fairly demotivating for a creator who fed off excitement.

454
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:07,180
Grade is just another casualty of the drama, regardless of whether he was right or wrong,

455
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:14,180
none of the creators who were really there in the midst of that 2016 mess, are really doing it with the same passion.

456
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:19,180
H3 has taken hiatus on his channel, spoke about being drained, we all know what happened to Leafy,

457
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:25,180
and although iDubbbz has arguably become the kingmaker of commentary, he hasn't made a content cop in a while,

458
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:30,180
and he doesn't really talk about it, and there are rumours that he doesn't really enjoy its legacy.

459
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:35,180
I mean, I wouldn't either, that's a huge weight to deliver some world destroying criticism.

460
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:41,180
The only person who really came out happy was Keemstar, and that's because he's insane and lives off drama,

461
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,180
and creates it when there isn't any.

462
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:48,180
Grade burned everyone in his path, and then stood in the ashes and asked what happened,

463
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,180
and that's why I don't ever think he'll fully stick around,

464
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:56,180
because Grade is a person who became reliant on the environment to power his content from,

465
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:00,180
Reddit to Drama Alert, and now he's just another guy making videos.

466
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:06,180
Even if they pull views, he's gonna have trouble building a community because many creators don't trust him,

467
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,180
and he probably doesn't trust them either.

468
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:13,180
The days of old commentary are over, and Grade just doesn't belong, and that's a shame,

469
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:17,180
because his content did have value, with retrospect to my previous video.

470
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:21,180
I think it's fair to say that there are many elements that caused the rise of Grade,

471
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:27,180
but ultimately, it was the drama that caused the fall. I don't know if he'll ever get that back.

472
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:31,180
With that said, I don't think there is an animosity to reflect upon his content with.

473
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:34,180
I think he didn't always handle things with the right demeanour,

474
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:38,180
and he was definitely sucked into an addiction that ultimately left him worse for wear,

475
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:45,180
but he still had a great cultural impact on the site, and his content is still important to this day,

476
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:49,180
for many, many reasons, and you can't take that away from him.

477
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:55,180
So, as much as this is a discussion, a discourse, a critique, it's also a tribute,

478
00:38:55,180 --> 00:39:01,180
because there is no one quite like Grade A Under Ray, and I don't think there ever will be.

479
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:07,180
So that was the video rounding off the two part series.

480
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,180
I really hope you guys enjoyed it.

481
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:13,180
Definitely some of the longer stuff again, being the fact that I had to split it into two parts.

482
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,180
I would love to hear any thoughts in the comments section below, really interesting discussion.

483
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:21,180
I want to give a big shoutout to my editors, who've done a fantastic job.

485
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:30,180
they do stellar work, and I'm sure this is going to be a marvel to behold, I really hope it is at least.

486
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:34,180
I also want to give a big shoutout to my Patreons, all up on stream right now,

487
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:38,180
the shoutout to the $50 Patreons, you can't ignore them.

488
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:45,180

489
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:52,180

490
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:56,180
