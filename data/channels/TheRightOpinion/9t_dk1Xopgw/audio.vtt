00:00.000 --> 00:02.560
So whatever happened to that Grade A Under A fella?

00:02.560 --> 00:08.720
If you piss off Grade A Under A, he's gonna do whatever he can to ruin you.

00:08.720 --> 00:10.560
Grade like all of us is a liar.

00:10.560 --> 00:11.840
There's a different standard for you.

00:11.840 --> 00:15.520
It wouldn't be the first time you've lied, because basically you've lied a lot of times, mate.

00:15.520 --> 00:20.320
And there's a different standard for Grade A Under A, and he will ruin you if he can.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:40.000 --> 00:44.360
too much free time, and today we continue the story of Grade A Under A.

00:44.360 --> 00:48.280
If you haven't watched part 1, I would highly recommend doing so, because many of the narratives

00:48.280 --> 00:52.880
that we discussed today are rooted in the previous video, however to aid continuity's

00:52.880 --> 00:57.080
sake, we join our story less than a year after Grey's channel was resuscitated through

00:57.080 --> 00:58.080
a Reddit post.

00:58.080 --> 01:02.000
He had turned his content into some of the most unique and marketable work on YouTube,

01:02.000 --> 01:04.180
and was approaching the peak of his career.

01:04.180 --> 01:08.720
He was stepping effortlessly between his drama and non-drama content, and gaining support

01:08.720 --> 01:10.360
at an unassailable rate.

01:10.360 --> 01:14.980
The sudden interest in an actual genre that could generate its own content whilst simultaneously

01:14.980 --> 01:19.440
being able to comment on it definitely had its appeals, and being a person of strong,

01:19.440 --> 01:23.100
unmitigated sentiments, Grade had found his rhythm.

01:23.100 --> 01:28.620
His content picked up to an unbelievable pace at around mid-January of 2016, just after

01:28.620 --> 01:32.780
the release of his second Nicole Arber video, in which he breaks down Arber's side of

01:32.780 --> 01:37.260
her abuse story against Matthew Santoro, and exposes some rather glowing inconsistencies

01:37.260 --> 01:41.660
within her testimony, but equally as quick as he took off, he was to encounter his fair

01:41.660 --> 01:44.620
share of drama, the tables were about to turn.

01:44.620 --> 01:48.220
His first warning of this should have come with a very small YouTuber by the name of

01:48.220 --> 01:49.220
Reactor.

01:49.220 --> 01:53.220
Reactor is a satire channel who parodied a lot of larger reaction channels.

01:53.220 --> 01:58.380
Now Reactor had barely 30 subscribers, and therefore basically posed no threat, but he

01:58.380 --> 02:02.700
decided that given Grade's rather outspoken position on reaction channels, he'd meddle

02:02.700 --> 02:04.660
a little on Grade's own channel.

02:04.660 --> 02:08.980
Now this is where we harken back to Grade's Vegan Gains video, because in the Vegan Gains

02:08.980 --> 02:14.460
video, what Grade did was remix Vegan Gains' words and turn it into this wacky, hilarious

02:14.460 --> 02:15.460
parody.

02:15.460 --> 02:19.140
Grade did much of the same, but did it more convincingly because Grade doesn't show his

02:19.140 --> 02:23.020
face, and therefore if you weren't paying attention, the difference in tone may have

02:23.020 --> 02:24.020
gone over your head.

02:24.020 --> 02:27.020
Grade- One of my favourite YouTube channels is Reactor, right?

02:27.020 --> 02:30.900
Despite what they say, this guy is fucking genius.

02:30.900 --> 02:35.540
Your videos do show your reactions, but they're fucking genius, right?

02:35.540 --> 02:36.540
That was genius, man.

02:36.540 --> 02:39.140
That was a really nice touch to the video.

02:39.140 --> 02:41.140
Literally over 95% genius.

02:41.140 --> 02:43.620
That's something to be proud of.

02:43.620 --> 02:47.140
It's still pretty obvious, but maybe some of the younger audience failed to detect the

02:47.140 --> 02:52.160
contrast in tone and audio quality, so Reactor uploaded this and then paid a few hundred

02:52.160 --> 02:57.140
to have the video shown as an ad before Grade's videos, basically fooling a few naive people

02:57.140 --> 03:00.420
into thinking that Grade had given Reactor a shoutout.

03:00.420 --> 03:05.060
He then gave this video extra publicity, and even more ironically, by using the reddit

03:05.060 --> 03:08.800
system to promote the documentation of his little project.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.860
It was a pretty genius prank.

03:10.860 --> 03:15.340
Fortunately, Grade didn't find it too funny, not just leaving multiple rather vexed comments

03:15.340 --> 03:19.780
on Reactor's video, but then subsequently bringing it up in a future video when discussing

03:19.780 --> 03:20.780
the situation.

03:20.780 --> 03:25.220
Grade- I've also had some guy use my copyrighted material to put together a fake advert for

03:25.220 --> 03:29.340
himself which deceived and fooled a bunch of people into subscribing to it.

03:29.340 --> 03:33.240
And although this certainly didn't lead to much at the time, it should have been foreshadowing

03:33.240 --> 03:36.220
that Grade wasn't quite the critic that he had sculpted.

03:36.220 --> 03:40.500
That sort of attitude doesn't really wash with a channel that's a fraction of his

03:40.500 --> 03:42.540
size, and clearly taking the piss.

03:42.540 --> 03:47.340
And make no mistake, it was blatant bait, but so was Grade's video on Vegan Gains.

03:47.340 --> 03:51.500
The difference with Reactor's video is if Grade takes the bait, he proves Reactor's

03:51.500 --> 03:52.500
point.

03:52.500 --> 03:56.040
Grade- I think I get it now, you fuck with other YouTube channels to create controversy,

03:56.040 --> 03:59.720
and then when people start fucking with you, you cry for sympathy.

03:59.720 --> 04:03.740
Now I don't entirely agree with the point that Grade blew up solely off drama, it's

04:03.740 --> 04:07.960
clear he had some very interesting components to his character beyond that, but by being

04:07.960 --> 04:12.060
angry at someone over something that many people would agree isn't a big deal, and

04:12.060 --> 04:31.340
lambasting behaviours that he'd previously overlooked and even indulged in himself, it

04:31.340 --> 04:35.760
showed him up as lacking some self-awareness, and self-awareness is one of the essentials

04:35.760 --> 04:37.120
to delivering criticism.

04:37.120 --> 04:42.500
This wasn't a big deal, but it was a warning, a warning that was not heeded, unfortunately.

04:42.500 --> 04:46.960
Now as the year progressed we started to see more drama, and this led to various creators

04:46.960 --> 04:48.760
weighing in specific situations.

04:48.760 --> 04:53.600
One of the most significant movements was the larger YouTuber movement against drama,

04:53.600 --> 04:59.220
made by people such as Markiplier, PewDiePie, and Matthew Santoro, basically criticising

04:59.220 --> 05:03.600
the drama that had been going on within the community, because it was fairly recognisable

05:03.600 --> 05:04.600
at that point.

05:04.600 --> 05:08.720
Grade was a fairly staunch defender though of the drama, because it probably gave him

05:08.720 --> 05:13.400
views, but likely because he was on good terms with two people, Leafy and Keemstar, people

05:13.400 --> 05:15.680
who benefited off drama greatly.

05:15.680 --> 05:20.560
Grade always had a way of turning response videos, even if they made valid points into

05:20.560 --> 05:25.760
exposed videos of their own, and his response video to the drama was no different, as at

05:25.760 --> 05:31.220
the end he inserted a little part exposing Matthew Santoro for allegedly plagiarising

05:31.220 --> 05:45.700
content.

05:45.700 --> 05:50.040
Now it wasn't relevant to the points that he was making with regards to the video, but

05:50.040 --> 05:55.300
Grade wanted to survive, and it served as a spicy side dish, and really impacted Santoro's

05:55.340 --> 05:59.780
ability to speak on matters again, and like the cute little double team they are, Drama

05:59.780 --> 06:01.380
Alert reported it later on.

06:01.380 --> 06:10.580
And now for our final story, today GradeAUnderA uploaded a video calling three YouTubers,

06:10.580 --> 06:16.960
PewDiePie, Markiplier, and Matthew Santoro, on their drama videos, but towards the end

06:16.960 --> 06:24.780
of the video, Matthew Santoro got it the worse, as GradeAUnderA exposed him, exposed him,

06:24.780 --> 06:25.780
for plagiarism.

06:25.780 --> 06:30.460
This is all important information, in a Reddit Q&A on March the 3rd, someone asked Grade for

06:30.460 --> 06:35.520
his opinion on Keemstar, Grade replied that he liked him, and that he's genuinely been

06:35.520 --> 06:40.520
nothing but nice to him from the start, he has no reason to hate him at all.

06:40.520 --> 06:44.300
Grade loved drama, so it was only natural that he was going to love someone who supported

06:44.300 --> 06:48.500
that cycle, and Keemstar probably loved him for the exact same reasons.

06:48.500 --> 06:52.660
Grade would appear on Drama Alert and regularly interact with Papa Keem, however as the year

06:52.660 --> 06:56.860
progressed you got the feeling that Grade involved himself with drama for the sake of

06:56.860 --> 07:01.420
it being drama, rather than the fact that he actually felt strongly about these things,

07:01.420 --> 07:05.760
and when there were actual reputations of his associates at stake, he had a habit of

07:05.760 --> 07:09.580
going a bit quiet, such as the Leafy rant.

07:09.580 --> 07:14.140
Keemstar reported on it, offered H3 and Leafy a way to hash it out, Grade didn't really

07:14.140 --> 07:18.980
say much other than pulling the plug on a planned podcast between him, Leafy, and Sky

07:18.980 --> 07:24.020
Williams after having a serious conversation which they would rather not talk about.

07:24.020 --> 07:29.220
That situation was to become extremely messy in no time at all, but Leafy eventually emerged

07:29.220 --> 07:34.660
in just about one piece, partly due to the unity inspired by the Matt Hoss situation.

07:34.660 --> 07:39.380
But then barely two months later, the tables turned once more, when the man himself, iDubbbz,

07:39.380 --> 07:44.860
released a fairly comprehensive content cop on Keemstar, making him practically indefensible,

07:44.860 --> 07:47.560
and suddenly the drama came very close to home.

07:47.560 --> 07:52.780
But there wasn't a rush of responses immediately, no, this was to come in June, with videos

07:52.780 --> 07:57.400
from other creators like Pyrocynical also garnering impressive amounts of views.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.540
It's one of his most viewed to this day.

07:59.540 --> 08:03.760
The Leafy shark caught a scent of blood and decided to move in on his old pal, and going

08:03.760 --> 08:08.660
into battle alongside him was the man himself, Grade A under A. Keemstar seemed to be the

08:08.660 --> 08:13.060
easiest target on the platform, he was bleeding subs, and you would be very hard pressed to

08:13.060 --> 08:18.280
find his fanbase outside of his own comment section, and there was a genuine expectation

08:18.280 --> 08:21.020
for his child to just collapse at any moment.

08:21.060 --> 08:25.660
However, at this moment, the moment where everything seemed the easiest, the drama would

08:25.660 --> 08:27.660
bring them far too close to the sun.

08:37.080 --> 08:42.260
Now, I obviously mentioned during my previous part what Grade said in his Reddit post about Keemstar.

08:42.260 --> 08:46.540
To summarise, he has conducted some fairly questionable actions, but at the end of it

08:46.700 --> 08:52.980
he's been nothing but supportive of him and his work, and helped expand his channel and stand up for his content.

08:52.980 --> 08:58.320
So with the sudden tidal wave of hatred going towards Keem, with his channel haemorrhaging subscribers,

08:58.320 --> 09:00.320
what position would Grade take?

09:09.780 --> 09:11.780
That doesn't sound so supportive.

09:11.820 --> 09:15.620
Now that clips from his second part, but the first part is no less brutal.

09:15.620 --> 09:20.420
For context, with his old pal Leafy turning fairly viciously on Keem, Grade found himself

09:20.420 --> 09:25.860
back in the crossfire, but a fairly one-sided crossfire at that, with Leafy's video allegedly

09:25.860 --> 09:27.980
nailing Keem down for his behaviour.

09:27.980 --> 09:32.140
The thing is that Leafy's video really pulls Grade into it and ties him in that future

09:32.140 --> 09:34.340
position that he has to take.

09:34.340 --> 09:38.540
This was probably done with some coordination, they're in this together, and this is important,

09:38.540 --> 09:41.300
I want you to hold this point in your head for later.

09:41.300 --> 09:45.340
And Killer Keemstar is pretty much the most hated man on the internet right now.

09:45.340 --> 09:48.420
So many exposed videos have been made on this guy, right?

09:48.420 --> 09:53.820
But they do nothing to him, he's the cockroach of YouTube, he keeps fucking surviving.

09:53.820 --> 10:00.900
But listen, hopefully that'll end with this organised attack that's been going on over the past week or two.

10:00.900 --> 10:05.140
Basically, the setting of Grade's two videos was that he was hoping he could be part of

10:05.140 --> 10:09.780
this extremely organised campaign to remove Keemstar from the platform altogether.

10:09.780 --> 10:14.580
He had noticed that there had been a run of videos made on him, and thought that he could finish him off.

10:14.580 --> 10:19.780
A lot of his points were about Keem's behaviour, claims such as doxing, false pedophile allegations,

10:19.780 --> 10:25.380
hypocrisy, exploitation, the victim card, racism, harassment, and domestic abuse.

10:25.380 --> 10:29.380
Some of these were not like claims at all, and would have serious repercussions.

10:29.380 --> 10:35.380
Grade listed them off to prove a point, that Keemstar is someone who should never be given any platform whatsoever.

10:35.380 --> 10:38.180
As exposed videos go, it's comprehensive for sure.

10:38.180 --> 10:43.180
Some claims were fairly well substantiated and convincing, others a bit more risky,

10:43.180 --> 10:48.980
and certainly should have been more thoroughly researched, such as pedophile or domestic abuse allegations.

10:48.980 --> 10:51.580
I'm not sure they would have passed in today's environment.

10:51.580 --> 10:55.180
But who cared? People were dunking on Keemstar left, right, and centre,

10:55.180 --> 10:59.380
and if there was a bit of collateral damage done, well, karma, right?

10:59.380 --> 11:04.380
His child was on his way down anyway, it wasn't like he was going to come back from this.

11:04.580 --> 11:08.980
At the end of the video, Grade endorses Keem's number one competitor, Scarce,

11:08.980 --> 11:11.380
saying that he's been killing it recently.

11:11.380 --> 11:15.380
This was an attempt to make Keem irrelevant, and having a news source on the website

11:15.380 --> 11:18.180
that covered drama and didn't instigate it.

11:18.180 --> 11:23.180
This video won over a lot of people, and it still wins over people to this day,

11:23.180 --> 11:27.780
and I can understand why, but with all the information that I had researched with regards to this,

11:27.780 --> 11:33.780
I couldn't help but feel a bit uncomfortable when Grade was going off about how anyone could support him,

11:33.780 --> 11:36.980
when he'd been supporting him less than a few months before.

11:36.980 --> 11:41.180
Now, what you could say is that he was ignorant to certain incidents,

11:41.180 --> 11:45.180
and the unearthing of these incidents in the following months had shifted his position.

11:45.180 --> 11:48.980
But it's hard to fully believe that perspective when certain examples arise,

11:48.980 --> 11:55.580
such as his false pedo allegation against the YouTuber RSGloryandGold that happened in around January 2016.

11:55.580 --> 12:00.180
Now, everyone knew about that, but Grade seems pretty harsh in how he frames it,

12:00.180 --> 12:06.780
and even as a former friend, it's hard to process that someone would turn so brutally out of genuine sentiment,

12:06.780 --> 12:11.980
to the point that they would knowingly run on very shaky abuse and pedophilia allegations.

12:11.980 --> 12:17.980
It doesn't feel real, and let me make it clear, I've turned on people when I think that they haven't learned their lesson,

12:17.980 --> 12:24.380
but many of these examples are years old, and the logic implied through much of this is that the person that Grade was supportive of

12:24.380 --> 12:29.980
is suddenly undermined by his old behaviour, and there are definitely claims that aren't undone by age,

12:29.980 --> 12:32.780
but they're normally the ones with the least substantiation.

12:32.780 --> 12:36.780
I find most of Grade's claims, as someone who is a former friend of Keemstar,

12:36.780 --> 12:41.780
to either fall into the category of things that Grade definitely knew about and probably acknowledged,

12:41.780 --> 12:45.580
things that were so old that they could be undone by present experience,

12:45.580 --> 12:48.780
or things that are lacking evidence or necessary context.

12:48.780 --> 12:53.180
There are expectations to this, and Keem was deserving of a lot of criticism,

12:53.180 --> 12:59.780
but it felt much like a bandwagon on their part, and in a way, the Keemstar drama would be the escalation of the year,

12:59.780 --> 13:03.980
and once you reach a climax, you're only setting yourself up for disappointment.

13:03.980 --> 13:09.980
And so that's what you saw, a gradual tail-off until September, at which point, of course,

13:09.980 --> 13:15.980
iDubbbz dropped his content cop on Leafy, and there was once again an immediate effect.

13:15.980 --> 13:21.780
Now, I could talk about iDubbbz's content cop forever, there's a lot to say about it, and it's probably better that I save that,

13:21.780 --> 13:28.780
but the real telling effect of it is that it hit Grade too, even though he only made one very brief appearance in it.

13:28.980 --> 13:35.780
Grade, he said a bunch of, uh, critical shit of Keemstar, but then on top of that, he couldn't just leave it there.

13:35.780 --> 13:38.580
He had to say that Scarce is killing him recently.

13:38.580 --> 13:40.580
Go subscribe to Scarce!

13:40.580 --> 13:47.580
Don't subscribe to Scarce. I know I'm months behind on this one, but subscribe to Scarce when his content gets better.

13:47.580 --> 13:51.780
Scarce is overweight, but more importantly than that, Scarce is boring.

13:51.780 --> 13:56.380
Grade A and Leafy, complete fucking retards. Actual retards.

13:56.380 --> 13:58.180
Yo, is this person fucking retarded?

13:58.180 --> 13:58.780
Yes.

13:58.780 --> 14:00.580
Yo, is this person fucking retarded?

14:00.580 --> 14:01.180
Yes.

14:01.180 --> 14:07.180
However, I think the moment that broke both Leafy and Grade's credibility was this part.

14:07.180 --> 14:13.180
If Keemstar's a rat, then Leafy is a fucking snake. Greasy, slimy, slithery cunt.

14:13.180 --> 14:21.180
And I say both Leafy and Grade's credibility because, as I mentioned earlier, Leafy and Grade tied themselves together in that drama,

14:21.180 --> 14:23.380
that personal experience with Keemstar.

14:23.380 --> 14:27.180
iDubbbz's quote calling Leafy Egg Snake is no less applicable to Grade.

14:27.180 --> 14:32.380
Both of them purposely distanced themselves from someone who they knew much better than they let on,

14:32.380 --> 14:36.580
and even if the criticisms were legitimate, you turn it back on them and say,

14:36.580 --> 14:41.180
well, why did they associate themselves with him in the first place if they were aware of this?

14:41.180 --> 14:46.180
iDubbbz, in a very short amount of time, revealed Leafy and Grade for the Fairweather friends that they were.

14:46.180 --> 14:51.180
iDubbbz's video also came out at a time where the hype around Grade's channel was rather low.

14:51.180 --> 14:57.980
There was a significant lack of drama occurring, and iDubbbz had the chance to really halt whatever momentum they had, and he did.

14:57.980 --> 15:04.180
Grade lost 3,500 subscribers on the day of the video, and this wasn't going to ease up in the following weeks.

15:04.180 --> 15:10.980
A lot of people wonder why iDubbbz's video hit Grade, and in particular Leafy, so much that it caused long-term damage.

15:10.980 --> 15:18.180
Well, partly because their appeal was based on their credibility as creators, and iDubbbz fundamentally managed to undermine that.

15:18.180 --> 15:24.180
Equally, iDubbbz is a person with such a clearly defined moral compass, regardless of whether you agree with him or not,

15:24.180 --> 15:28.180
it makes it very hard to turn around to him and try and lecture him on anything.

15:28.180 --> 15:34.180
Grade once again found himself in the crossfire, with the person he went into battle with now taking significant flak.

15:34.180 --> 15:36.180
How could he respond?

15:36.180 --> 15:38.180
Well, let's discuss that.

15:39.180 --> 15:52.180
There was this expectation that given that he was called out by iDubbbz, he would respond alongside Leafy,

15:52.180 --> 15:57.180
and with the information given today, and the way he's behaved, it really shouldn't surprise us.

15:57.180 --> 16:03.180
With that said, even if you think your friend might have done some stupid shit, if you were genuinely invested in their future,

16:03.180 --> 16:07.180
you'd still probably make a case that they could learn from this, and we should move forward.

16:07.180 --> 16:14.180
But Grade chose not to. No one was entitled to a defence, and sometimes the best thing to do in these circumstances is just to say nothing at all.

16:14.180 --> 16:18.180
But still, that's not exactly what he did.

16:18.180 --> 16:23.180
Now, after the first day, his subscriber count didn't necessarily bleed like Leafy's, but it did stagnate,

16:23.180 --> 16:28.180
and whether that was motivation for Grade to make a video on it or not is another question,

16:28.180 --> 16:31.180
but regardless of the question, he did receive an answer.

16:31.180 --> 16:35.180
So let's talk about the videos that prolonged his suffering.

16:35.180 --> 16:39.180
The thing is, the video that he made isn't actually to do with the drama,

16:39.180 --> 16:44.180
it's more to do with how he's felt drained, and uninspired, and something that we all feel.

16:44.180 --> 16:49.180
However, I can understand why a lot of people interpreted this as a victim card.

16:49.180 --> 16:56.180
If you believe Grade was rather calculated and cynical, then this would be the best way to gain sympathy from an unsuspecting audience,

16:56.180 --> 16:59.180
without necessarily responding to claims.

16:59.180 --> 17:06.180
As we've all seen, many people with legitimate reason thought it was in Grade's nature to not be the most honest in his videos.

17:06.180 --> 17:11.180
With that said, it wouldn't surprise me if Grade did legitimately feel fed up of making videos.

17:11.180 --> 17:16.180
The hype had died, the drama alongside it. It was a sad time for his content.

17:16.180 --> 17:23.180
It was also, in a way, his own doing. He contributed to that culture, and I'm sure he was aware of that.

17:23.180 --> 17:28.180
When you lose your excitement and your enthusiasm for making videos, you don't feel that urge to go that extra mile,

17:28.180 --> 17:34.180
to make the video go from just good to amazing, and it ends up just being meh instead, do you know what I mean?

17:34.180 --> 17:37.180
And because of that, the videos start to suffer.

17:37.180 --> 17:42.180
And what struck me about this video is that on reflection, over the spell of 2016,

17:42.180 --> 17:48.180
particularly in the three or four months in reference, the videos became significantly less comedic in their delivery.

17:48.180 --> 17:52.180
And this is where we bring back my first part of this very lengthy saga,

17:52.180 --> 17:55.180
where he spoke about what made his videos quite entertaining.

17:55.180 --> 18:00.180
No longer was there that attention to detail, those comedic pauses, that feeling of build-up,

18:00.180 --> 18:06.180
but more just a continuous flow of rants, and because of that, it kind of killed any sort of tension that may lead to laughs.

18:06.180 --> 18:12.180
And as I mentioned, a joke is much more than just its punchline, and I feel that Grade lost that.

18:12.180 --> 18:16.180
And although it wasn't like he didn't have good jokes, it was just that they didn't land as well.

18:16.180 --> 18:21.180
Especially my last video, right? I wasn't happy with that video at all, but I still felt like I had to upload it.

18:21.180 --> 18:24.180
Why did they skip Vitamins B, 8, 10, and 11?

18:24.180 --> 18:31.180
And fog-skipping those numbers, that wouldn't even be an issue in the first place, had you not called them all Vitamin B!

18:31.180 --> 18:35.180
Especially when there are empty slots for Vitamins F through J.

18:35.180 --> 18:42.180
It sometimes felt like he'd lost awareness of how he had set his character up, in that semi-satirical fashion of the judgmental prick.

18:42.180 --> 18:47.180
His more modern content seemed to lack that irony, and maybe this was due to the drama,

18:47.180 --> 18:51.180
which led Grade to making much more serious videos that relied on conveying credibility.

18:51.180 --> 18:56.180
Up until this situation, we constantly let comedy get in the way of actual points.

18:56.180 --> 19:00.180
A great example would have been the PewDiePie, Markiplier, Santoro response video.

19:00.180 --> 19:07.180
There were a ton of ad hominems there, and we almost just completely overlooked them because they were part of Grade's character,

19:07.180 --> 19:10.180
but both of those sides were becoming dangerously integrated.

19:10.180 --> 19:14.180
In his latest video, is Grade overreacting to drama as a joke?

19:14.180 --> 19:18.180
Is it the same Grade who ranted about interviews as a gag,

19:18.180 --> 19:24.180
or is it a new Grade who wants us to take his word seriously while still keeping up the same tone and demeanor?

19:24.180 --> 19:27.180
And how can you just go from one persona like that to the other?

19:27.180 --> 19:31.180
H3 is an example of people who can do that, or did that,

19:31.180 --> 19:37.180
because they knew how to differentiate their style between their regular humorous content and their serious videos,

19:37.180 --> 19:39.180
which called out YouTube and YouTubers alike.

19:39.180 --> 19:46.180
Grade didn't do that, and maybe because he couldn't see the vast difference between his drama-related content and his more casual videos.

19:46.180 --> 19:49.180
Maybe it didn't occur to him, but there was a difference,

19:49.180 --> 19:53.180
and it was pulling him into a position that he couldn't afford to maintain.

19:53.180 --> 19:56.180
Because drama doesn't last, your character does,

19:56.180 --> 20:00.180
and if you build a persona off drama, or you let it be influenced by it,

20:00.180 --> 20:04.180
then when the drama dies, your shortcomings will be exposed as a crater.

20:04.180 --> 20:06.180
And that was the problem with Grade's drama videos,

20:06.180 --> 20:11.180
it was all created on the basis of its content, and not really the person talking,

20:11.180 --> 20:14.180
who really wasn't that reasonable as a persona.

20:14.180 --> 20:21.180
Drama drained Grade's personality, and then when he tried to reapply it to his regular content, it didn't feel the same.

20:21.180 --> 20:28.180
Grade's first video mainly caused a loss in subscribers because it felt like it was a very indirect way to respond to the content cop,

20:28.180 --> 20:31.180
and I can't look into Grade's mind and see what he was thinking,

20:31.180 --> 20:34.180
but I do see it as a bit too good to be a coincidence,

20:34.180 --> 20:37.180
that he would release such a video in the circumstances.

20:37.180 --> 20:41.180
However, he wasn't finished. Throughout the weeks following the content cop,

20:41.180 --> 20:46.180
there was significant backlash from a few creators, such as Sinnoh, Quentin Reviews and Tommy C.

20:46.180 --> 20:51.180
These creators brought a variety of different points to the table, some more valid than others,

20:51.180 --> 20:58.180
and for the first time, Grade was staring down serious criticism, and serious allegations. How would he respond?

20:58.180 --> 21:03.180
Listen, some of these allegations are fucking crazy, so I didn't see any reason to address them, right?

21:03.180 --> 21:06.180
But as it turns out, some people actually believe in them!

21:06.180 --> 21:12.180
Seriously though, YouTube's not the site that it used to be. It has gone from this, to this.

21:12.180 --> 21:17.180
People are desperate for drama, so I need to quickly address all the allegations in this video,

21:17.180 --> 21:23.180
before they start getting out of hand, and I'm being accused of planning 9-11, and being in the fucking Illuminati.

21:23.180 --> 21:28.180
Right, with all the context now, of this video, you can't even begin to comprehend the irony of this.

21:28.180 --> 21:32.180
A person who was more than happy to make weak claims against someone else,

21:32.180 --> 21:36.180
is now outraged that other people are making weak claims against him.

21:36.180 --> 21:38.180
Once again, some are valid, some are not.

21:38.180 --> 21:43.180
But then he has the audacity to pull this YouTube isn't the same anymore card,

21:43.180 --> 21:45.180
despite being a torchbearer for drama.

21:45.180 --> 21:52.180
The video comprises of him responding to a few claims, most of them straw manned in a way that made it easier for him to respond to them,

21:52.180 --> 21:56.180
because that's what you can do when you're the person acting as your own critic.

21:56.180 --> 22:01.180
And yes, sometimes it can be entertaining or funny, but it should be acknowledged as a comedic measure,

22:01.180 --> 22:03.180
not an actual argumentation strategy.

22:03.180 --> 22:09.180
Well you know what I heard? I heard Greyde is a pedophile!

22:09.180 --> 22:15.180
And this video is where I think the wheels really started to come off the Grey Train. Let's explain why.

22:15.180 --> 22:27.180
I've always said, being able to respond to drama is an essential aspect of participating in drama.

22:27.180 --> 22:33.180
Greyde's response may have worked at the time, with his fanbase, but in retrospect it does not hold up at all,

22:33.180 --> 22:37.180
not in my opinion at least, especially with the context considered.

22:37.180 --> 22:43.180
He said some insanely racist shit against minorities, and I'm a minority myself,

22:43.180 --> 22:48.180
and people say it's a business decision. These are words that came from his mouth, and his mouth alone.

22:48.180 --> 22:56.180
So if I don't stick by my racist friend and tickle his balls while he makes racist statements about a group of people that I myself belong to,

22:56.180 --> 22:59.180
that's backstabbing, is it?

22:59.180 --> 23:08.180
I'm sorry, as racist as what Keem said was, it bemuses me to think that Greyde had only just found this years old content out

23:09.180 --> 23:17.180
and at that point, after everything, decided to break off a friendship of which he had described Keemstar as nothing but supportive of him,

23:17.180 --> 23:24.180
rather than confronting Keem about his transgressions. By comparing Keem to a member of the KKK,

23:24.180 --> 23:30.180
it just shows how redundant these arguments are, and completely dismissive of all context.

23:30.180 --> 23:35.180
It's quite funny how some people only care about racism when they can use it to prove a point.

23:35.180 --> 23:39.180
I mean, you could literally have a logical, fassy day out here.

23:39.180 --> 23:41.180
He starts off with the strawman,

23:47.180 --> 23:52.180
then he makes a false equivalence, before gaslighting his critics, implying they've been manipulated.

23:59.180 --> 24:04.180
He then responds to the allegation that he inspired a million dollar lawsuit against Matthew Santoro,

24:04.180 --> 24:09.180
which should be an easy thing to respond to, I mean, no one has any evidence of that.

24:09.180 --> 24:14.180
Just say it's not true, and that didn't happen, and the burden of proof is on your critics,

24:14.180 --> 24:17.180
but he takes it down this very bizarre route.

24:17.180 --> 24:24.180
He's an online cartoonist who can barely draw, yet despite this, I apparently encouraged a large company

24:24.180 --> 24:27.180
to file a million dollar lawsuit against someone.

24:27.180 --> 24:31.180
Guys, he's an online cartoonist who can barely draw.

24:31.180 --> 24:36.180
He has no influence, bar the 3 million subscribers of course, but don't mention them.

24:36.180 --> 24:41.180
Like, why would you say that? I'm a guy who speaks into his microphone and lives in a one room flat.

24:41.180 --> 24:44.180
What influence do I have, guys? Don't listen to me.

24:44.180 --> 24:49.180
Now, I don't necessarily believe the claim, but to respond to the claim saying that you don't have influence

24:49.180 --> 24:51.180
is a weird way to respond.

24:51.180 --> 24:56.180
He then basically spends the next part of the video working out how to disassociate him from the narrative

24:56.180 --> 24:58.180
that grouped him and Leafy together.

24:59.180 --> 25:01.180
Fuck you, grade, you and Leafy-

25:01.180 --> 25:08.180
Listen, like I said, right, I am not Leafy. I honestly cannot fucking believe that I'm having to explain this, right?

25:08.180 --> 25:15.180
But this guy is not this guy, and I'm getting dragged into drama that has nothing to do with me because of this.

25:15.180 --> 25:22.180
Like for example, right, during the iDubbbz and LeafyIsHair drama, despite me being neither of these two YouTubers,

25:22.180 --> 25:25.180
some people expected me to get involved in this drama for some reason.

25:25.180 --> 25:28.180
Essentially trying to untie the anchor from his ankle.

25:28.180 --> 25:34.180
Despite the fact that he was boasting in his original video on Keem, this was very clearly an organised attack,

25:34.180 --> 25:38.180
and joking about the actual vocal association in other videos.

25:38.180 --> 25:45.180
But listen, hopefully that'll end with this organised attack that's been going on over the past week or two.

25:45.180 --> 25:51.180
First Pyrocynical, then Leafy, and now I'm making a video on Keemstar.

25:51.180 --> 25:53.180
Listen, I don't want to make a big deal out of this, right?

25:53.180 --> 26:01.180
But this many YouTubers of this size making videos calling out Keemstar realistically will not happen again, right?

26:01.180 --> 26:07.180
If you hate Keemstar, this is your one chance to get rid of him. So make it count.

26:07.180 --> 26:10.180
You can't pretend that never happens.

26:10.180 --> 26:16.180
What is there to say? I could go on and on about this response video, but in my opinion it is fairly terrible,

26:16.180 --> 26:21.180
and although it still received moderate support at the time, he was digging his own grave.

26:21.180 --> 26:24.180
With this video came another hit to subs.

26:24.180 --> 26:28.180
The sharks were circling, he was called out publicly for some meltdowns that happened in the months prior,

26:29.180 --> 26:31.180
some on Reddit, some on stream.

26:31.180 --> 26:36.180
Go read that comment, go tell that fucking whore that's a mod on my fucking subreddit to link you to what I said to delete.

26:36.180 --> 26:38.180
Go tell it to link it, it's not bad at all.

26:38.180 --> 26:44.180
But why? Why was this happening? This person who had literally forgot his channel existed at one point,

26:44.180 --> 26:52.180
who clearly didn't consider YouTube a big deal, was now being perceived as this megalomania, and not without evidence.

26:52.180 --> 26:59.180
Well, I guess it's just the rabbit hole that sometimes people fall down, and in a way, we all fell down it with him,

26:59.180 --> 27:03.180
because he was one of the original guys who went after these creators and exposed them.

27:03.180 --> 27:10.180
Vegan Gains, Nicole Arber, even Ray William Johnson, but at the same time, they weren't the hardest people to go after,

27:10.180 --> 27:16.180
they were targets for whom we didn't really care how they were treated, just that they were sorted out for one reason or another.

27:16.180 --> 27:22.180
We wanted them gone, and now Grey has serious criticism facing him down, his responses just won't work,

27:22.180 --> 27:28.180
because he's going against people who haven't established enough of a reputation to be hated.

27:28.180 --> 27:35.180
The problem is, when we support people who argue in the way that Grey did, even to people we passionately hate,

27:35.180 --> 27:41.180
even to people we view as terrible human beings, we risk them turning around and turning their hoards on the wrong person,

27:41.180 --> 27:46.180
on a person who might just be a victim of mentality, with the same approach that we've endorsed.

27:46.180 --> 27:52.180
There are plenty of positions that I hate, there are people that I dislike, but at the end of the day,

27:52.180 --> 27:58.180
as cathartic and as tempting as it is to just go after someone's credibility, it's a risky measure long term.

27:58.180 --> 28:03.180
You risk influencing people to adopt that philosophy of discounting someone on a trivial basis,

28:03.180 --> 28:09.180
and even if you can wield that power properly and work out when someone should get it or when someone shouldn't,

28:09.180 --> 28:14.180
you're working with people who themselves are not as careful. On top of this, you're promoting a market

28:14.180 --> 28:20.180
in which it's successful to behave that way, which will create clones who are less nuanced than yourself.

28:20.180 --> 28:25.180
Now I want to make it very clear, we are allowed to make fun of each other, we are allowed to make fun of other commentators,

28:25.180 --> 28:34.180
even if the joke is lined in a level of cynicism, but mockery of someone's credibility is not a sufficient substitute for a point,

28:34.180 --> 28:38.180
maybe complementary in some instances, but not as a substitute.

28:38.180 --> 28:44.180
Grade was successful because his persona often disguised how some of his videos did tend to lack validity,

28:44.180 --> 28:49.180
not necessarily to what he was saying, but to the discussion that was trying to be had.

28:49.180 --> 28:56.180
Look at the Matthew Santoro video, and when he didn't have the arguments, he'd substitute them for more fallacies,

28:56.180 --> 29:00.180
with a tone that implied authority, but never really earned it.

29:00.180 --> 29:08.180
So, with this all in mind, Grade's sort of empire was coming to an end. Two incidents, two sub-drops,

29:08.180 --> 29:15.180
and a third time, he would've been a fool to make the same mistake, so I guess for him it was time to move on.

29:15.180 --> 29:20.180
And he did. But what did he move on to exactly? Well, let's find out.

29:20.180 --> 29:33.180
So with all this behind him, Grade decided to turn back to the lighthearted genre of politics.

29:33.180 --> 29:40.180
Yes, now remember, this is towards the back end of 2016, and that means it was at the presidential election time,

29:40.180 --> 29:44.180
Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were battling it out for the White House.

29:44.180 --> 29:49.180
Grade decided to cover this topic more meticulously than any of his previous situations,

29:49.180 --> 29:53.180
releasing a total of five videos, initiating with a critique of Casey Neistat,

29:53.180 --> 29:59.180
following interviews of both the main presidential candidates, an analysis of the American voting system,

29:59.180 --> 30:05.180
and concluding with a review of the reaction to, spoiler alert, Donald Trump's victory.

30:05.180 --> 30:11.180
The videos themselves were fine enough, I guess. He did go a bit more in-depth on Clinton, mind you,

30:11.180 --> 30:17.180
though I guess it made sense, because he likes to make exposed videos, and there's more for you to actually expose with Hillary,

30:17.180 --> 30:24.180
Donald Trump just continuously exposed himself, makes his job less fun, and he does in the end lend support to Sanders and Stein,

30:24.180 --> 30:28.180
so he certainly wasn't necessarily being sympathetic to either of the main candidates.

30:28.180 --> 30:34.180
Beyond that, the videos aren't particularly bad in their points, though it was certainly interesting to see someone like Grade

30:34.180 --> 30:40.180
talking about politics, not without their jokes in the delivery of course, but the points were all fairly serious.

30:40.180 --> 30:46.180
Now after this, he had his last really well performing video on people who hate video games,

30:46.180 --> 30:51.180
well performing for his size, of course, I mean, a lot of people dream of his consistent view count.

30:51.180 --> 30:56.180
After that, however, the views were fairly standard. He then returned to his more comedic style,

30:56.180 --> 31:02.180
and actually I think he was being fairly funny again. His arguments were more based in common sense than previous,

31:02.180 --> 31:08.180
and his tone had become a lot more uniform, just that one very angry guy, but he had some good jokes that would

31:08.180 --> 31:11.180
play off the rage fairly well, and did have some flow.

31:11.180 --> 31:17.180
I know I made a video a little while ago defending video games right, but despite how much I fucking love them right,

31:17.180 --> 31:23.180
there are some things I do find kind of annoying about them. Nothing big though, just a few small complaints.

31:23.180 --> 31:28.180
That made me want to throw my fucking controller through the TV.

31:28.180 --> 31:33.180
Maybe the drama dragged him down, and now he's out of it, he felt a bit more liberated, but at the same time,

31:33.180 --> 31:39.180
it also meant he lost a lot of support that came from the more drama oriented fans who'd moved on to creators

31:39.180 --> 31:46.180
who were more associated with trending topics. By 2017, none of the new videos really cracked the ceiling of 2 million views

31:46.180 --> 31:52.180
after a video game upload, however, on the other hand, his drama videos were unlikely to do as well as they previously did,

31:52.180 --> 31:58.180
because the drama kinda died, and he had distanced himself from it. In fact, following the political videos,

31:58.180 --> 32:04.180
the only time he really covered drama again was in the PewDiePie vs Wall Street Journal video, which was extremely late to the party,

32:04.180 --> 32:10.180
later than me. In a way, he'd split his audience down the middle, and there was no longer that guaranteed interest

32:10.180 --> 32:15.180
in what he spoke about. There were better commentary channels taking on the drama topics,

32:15.180 --> 32:18.180
but at least he had his more casual rant topics, right?

32:18.180 --> 32:24.180
Well, 2016 was the year of the storytime animators who really began taking on the qualms of daily life,

32:24.180 --> 32:30.180
and other topics in a similar field, providing Grade with real competition, and squeezing his market.

32:30.180 --> 32:35.180
People had noticed the fertile grounds and started farming, and Grade didn't really change it up,

32:35.180 --> 32:41.180
and in a way, could he? He still did fine for himself, but I guess even when you're doing well,

32:41.180 --> 32:45.180
it can feel like you're going nowhere, if it doesn't feel like progress.

32:45.180 --> 32:51.180
Grade was never a celebrity, he never had droves of people following him around every time he left his house,

32:51.180 --> 32:56.180
and that was his choice, for many reasons I think are likely sensible and justified.

32:56.180 --> 33:01.180
But one thing that I've noticed is that when you're not public, your life seems fairly ordinary,

33:01.180 --> 33:06.180
even with whatever success you're experiencing, you're not witnessing the real world repercussions

33:06.180 --> 33:11.180
of the content you make because you're still behind a screen. This can often alienate you from the impact

33:11.180 --> 33:16.180
of your content and even its success. Being a YouTuber really hasn't been much of a rush for me,

33:16.180 --> 33:21.180
because I haven't really changed my life at all, mainly because I want to finish my education,

33:21.180 --> 33:26.180
and so my lifestyle hasn't really altered beyond the fact that I spend most of my free time on YouTube,

33:26.180 --> 33:31.180
driving myself insane. I have a hunch that even with his success, Grade never really experienced it

33:31.180 --> 33:37.180
because he kept himself away from that world. I don't think that's a bad thing, but I do think it can lead

33:37.180 --> 33:43.180
to someone taking hiatus because it doesn't give them any satisfaction in return, and after PewDiePie vs

33:43.180 --> 33:49.180
Wall Street Journal video in March 2017, Grade did just that, he fell off the map.

33:49.180 --> 33:56.180
Until a few months later in May 2017, when Grade uploaded another video, implying that he was coming back,

33:56.180 --> 34:01.180
his hand coming from the grave, and announcing that there would be more YouTube videos and Twitch streams,

34:01.180 --> 34:07.180
with the audience's heart in his hands. This led to absolutely nothing for another two months, until

34:07.180 --> 34:14.180
when Grade announced his return in a much more elaborate video, and announcing that this would be the start of Season 2.

34:15.180 --> 34:33.180
In his video, he announces how he plans to go back to his more grassroots comedy, as it used to be,

34:33.180 --> 34:39.180
how he realised that pleasing the algorithms and merely appealing to trending topics just leads you to hating

34:39.180 --> 34:45.180
your general experience as a YouTuber, and why he was not going to conform to it. He also rants about how

34:45.180 --> 34:51.180
Jake Paul is ruining the site and driving all creativity down with it, he says he's been working on videos

34:51.180 --> 34:57.180
since the week before his upload, so understandably many people were excited to see what he was going to bring

34:57.180 --> 35:02.180
to his next video, if we ever received a next video, which we didn't for a long, long time.

35:02.180 --> 35:07.180
I don't think Grade was trolling when he uploaded his return videos, it would be a pretty funny troll,

35:07.180 --> 35:12.180
but I think it was very probable that he did have trouble being in the mood to record his content,

35:12.180 --> 35:18.180
and finding that recipe that worked for him all the times before. Drama is a rush, when you're involved in it,

35:18.180 --> 35:23.180
and you have the power to end careers, it's like you're Thanos with the Infinity Stones, and then it's gone,

35:23.180 --> 35:28.180
and you can't recapture that, and sometimes when people can't do that, they just lose faith.

35:28.180 --> 35:33.180
Normal content is a rhythm, and to find that you have to have a grip on what you're creating,

35:33.180 --> 35:38.180
a rush will disrupt that rhythm. Grade did eventually return, at the start of this year,

35:38.180 --> 35:44.180
we all had the sinking feeling that he wouldn't stick around, because although the hype for him was here,

35:44.180 --> 35:49.180
it was more an anticipation about his return, rather than actually investing in his content.

35:49.180 --> 35:54.180
His return video performed excellently, the videos following it, not so much.

35:54.180 --> 36:00.180
Do I think Grade regrets the drama? Maybe he does, at the time I can see why it's so enticing to get involved,

36:01.180 --> 36:06.180
but looking back on it, his content that had the most longevity are the videos that aren't on drama,

36:06.180 --> 36:12.180
the content that is just about everyone's daily lives, because people's lives aren't going to be changing soon,

36:12.180 --> 36:17.180
at least I don't think they are, and therefore, when you make content about that, it's always relevant,

36:17.180 --> 36:20.180
no matter their demographic, or the time that they're watching the video.

36:20.180 --> 36:26.180
Back when this screenshot was taken at the start of 2017, you can see that the difference between these two videos

36:26.180 --> 36:33.180
is around 100,000 views, and yet returning to his channel, we can now see that the difference is approximately 2.1 million,

36:33.180 --> 36:36.180
there's a reason for that, and I think I've explained it.

36:36.180 --> 36:41.180
Grade never really abruptly lost any of his momentum, because many people adored his style,

36:41.180 --> 36:46.180
to the point where he could probably just spend a whole video farting, and it would crack a million views,

36:46.180 --> 36:49.180
but from his perspective, it probably drained him.

36:49.180 --> 36:54.180
Also, the new copyright system hasn't helped his videos, with many of them being claimed retrospectively

36:54.180 --> 36:56.180
due to his use of music in transitions.

36:56.180 --> 37:02.180
All in all, I can see these instances being fairly demotivating for a creator who fed off excitement.

37:02.180 --> 37:07.180
Grade is just another casualty of the drama, regardless of whether he was right or wrong,

37:07.180 --> 37:14.180
none of the creators who were really there in the midst of that 2016 mess, are really doing it with the same passion.

37:14.180 --> 37:19.180
H3 has taken hiatus on his channel, spoke about being drained, we all know what happened to Leafy,

37:19.180 --> 37:25.180
and although iDubbbz has arguably become the kingmaker of commentary, he hasn't made a content cop in a while,

37:25.180 --> 37:30.180
and he doesn't really talk about it, and there are rumours that he doesn't really enjoy its legacy.

37:30.180 --> 37:35.180
I mean, I wouldn't either, that's a huge weight to deliver some world destroying criticism.

37:35.180 --> 37:41.180
The only person who really came out happy was Keemstar, and that's because he's insane and lives off drama,

37:41.180 --> 37:43.180
and creates it when there isn't any.

37:43.180 --> 37:48.180
Grade burned everyone in his path, and then stood in the ashes and asked what happened,

37:48.180 --> 37:51.180
and that's why I don't ever think he'll fully stick around,

37:51.180 --> 37:56.180
because Grade is a person who became reliant on the environment to power his content from,

37:56.180 --> 38:00.180
Reddit to Drama Alert, and now he's just another guy making videos.

38:00.180 --> 38:06.180
Even if they pull views, he's gonna have trouble building a community because many creators don't trust him,

38:06.180 --> 38:08.180
and he probably doesn't trust them either.

38:08.180 --> 38:13.180
The days of old commentary are over, and Grade just doesn't belong, and that's a shame,

38:13.180 --> 38:17.180
because his content did have value, with retrospect to my previous video.

38:17.180 --> 38:21.180
I think it's fair to say that there are many elements that caused the rise of Grade,

38:21.180 --> 38:27.180
but ultimately, it was the drama that caused the fall. I don't know if he'll ever get that back.

38:27.180 --> 38:31.180
With that said, I don't think there is an animosity to reflect upon his content with.

38:31.180 --> 38:34.180
I think he didn't always handle things with the right demeanour,

38:34.180 --> 38:38.180
and he was definitely sucked into an addiction that ultimately left him worse for wear,

38:38.180 --> 38:45.180
but he still had a great cultural impact on the site, and his content is still important to this day,

38:45.180 --> 38:49.180
for many, many reasons, and you can't take that away from him.

38:49.180 --> 38:55.180
So, as much as this is a discussion, a discourse, a critique, it's also a tribute,

38:55.180 --> 39:01.180
because there is no one quite like Grade A Under Ray, and I don't think there ever will be.

39:03.180 --> 39:07.180
So that was the video rounding off the two part series.

39:07.180 --> 39:09.180
I really hope you guys enjoyed it.

39:09.180 --> 39:13.180
Definitely some of the longer stuff again, being the fact that I had to split it into two parts.

39:13.180 --> 39:17.180
I would love to hear any thoughts in the comments section below, really interesting discussion.

39:17.180 --> 39:21.180
I want to give a big shoutout to my editors, who've done a fantastic job.

39:21.180 --> 39:25.180

39:25.180 --> 39:30.180
they do stellar work, and I'm sure this is going to be a marvel to behold, I really hope it is at least.

39:30.180 --> 39:34.180
I also want to give a big shoutout to my Patreons, all up on stream right now,

39:34.180 --> 39:38.180
the shoutout to the $50 Patreons, you can't ignore them.

39:38.180 --> 39:45.180
