0	8020	Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the right opinion of the home of a twat with
8020	12360	too much free time and I am fucking exploiting that free time right now because by my calculations
12360	16060	this video is going to be a 20 minute point so I hope you bellends have some patience
16060	19300	I would assure everyone that this is a special and if it does do well I may do specials once
19300	24860	a month or so if I can though I cannot guarantee or promise anything my free time has its boundaries
24860	54540	Back it up, pack it in, let me begin, I came to win, battle me that's a sin, I won't ever
54540	58060	slack up, hunk it better back up, try and play the role and you're the whole crew, well
58060	62500	act up, get up, stand up, come on throw your hands up, if you got the feeling, jump across
62500	65900	the ceiling, mugs let's all bump up, someone's talking junk, yeah we'll bust them in the
65900	67740	eye and then I'll take the punks home
67740	71140	Given that this is such a big event I need to introduce what this video is going to be
71140	73340	about I'm going to be looking at social experiments
73340	77060	and the recent chronology preceding this video, their creators and the implications
77060	79940	that they actually hold I'm on the warpath today and you're going
79940	83380	to be along for the ride with me, also I'm going to be focusing on racially divisive
83380	86900	videos and the effect that they have on the society around them
86900	91260	Now I know some of you will be saying but you said you want to cover YouTube drama,
91260	96060	well you twat this isn't just YouTube drama this is social experiments and they are greater
96060	99740	than YouTube they extend this to society and the impressionable idiots that believe the
99740	103260	propaganda they peddle This is not just a petulant personal gripe
103260	106380	nor is it just shit content which by the way it is
106380	109820	This is me saying that there is a genuine danger to the crap that these channels pathetically
109820	112680	pump out and profit from My intention in this video is to prevent one
112680	116860	of these disgustingly divisive and derivative videos from ever surfacing on the internet
116860	119720	ever again Which is a completely ridiculous far-fetched
119720	123920	ambition but I feel if I shoot for the stars I'll have more impact on these extremely egregious
123920	127880	vacuums of meaningful content I'm fucking going in and these cunts are going
127880	130760	to bear the brunt of it But first a little background
130760	134800	My first experience with social experiments was with the show What Would You Do an ABC
134800	139120	series that began in 2008 and created stage scenarios to see how the general public would
139120	140920	respond I was intrigued at the time and I watched
140920	144480	a fair few episodes which human psychology does genuinely interest me
144480	148020	Given the often controversial nature of the situations I was surprised by how passable
148020	150640	it seemed to most people It's never really had much of an accusation
150640	154680	of being fake though and to be honest when I watch it it does seem pretty representative
154680	157720	which is probably why I avoided any allegations or prosecutions
157720	163120	It had standards to maintain and although American TV isn't always the most real
163120	168120	There was something believable about it Sometime a few years ago YouTubers discovered
168120	171840	that there was a social media platform for these sorts of experiments and began enacting
171840	175920	them to the oblivious public In my opinion the first videos of these social
175920	179440	experiments were likely real with these said YouTubers finding their feet and working out
179440	183660	the limits of their social experiments However upon learning their limits they realised
183660	187400	in fact that there were no limits Not on YouTube at least
187400	191320	As long as you were making them a fuck tonne of money then who the fuck cares
191320	194640	And more importantly they couldn't prove your pranks to be fake
194640	196760	But thank god some people have
196760	200000	I have a lot to get through so let's start off with the most recent of controversies
200000	203320	and the silliest of YouTubers Joey Salads
203320	222160	All time looks like there's an Ebola outbreak in New York
222160	244780	Joey Salads has been around long enough for me to be aware of his antics
244780	248120	I have always had the niggling suspicion that his videos are completely faked
248120	250560	And now the simplest of snapchats has proved it
250560	254320	For anyone who has emerged from a 30 year coma and you're not aware of what's gone
254320	258440	down recently Joey Salads set up a fake social experiment in which he dressed a car in Trump
258440	261680	apparel and left it in a predominantly black area to see what would happen
261680	265320	In barely any time at all a load of youths turned up and completely trashed the car
265320	268880	In fact one of them had found a very well suited lead pipe in which I'm presuming he
268880	273280	had lying around in his humble abode in case any Trump supporting vehicles entered the
273280	275680	vicinity He concluded that because of this that black
275680	279040	people must hate Trump And that in elaboration of this fantastical
279040	282540	scenario he had people approach him and say they were scared to vote Trump because of
282540	285440	community hostility Now with the emergence of this new evidence
285440	288380	that proves this was all completely contrived and staged
288380	291520	I would normally just dismiss him as another money grabbing idiot who just wanted to make
291520	294320	a quick buck off racial tensions And he probably is
294320	299680	However that's already been spoken about You see this goes deeper than a normal smash
299680	302280	and grab If you were to glide onto his twitter and
302280	305520	have a scroll through his tweets it wouldn't take very long to realise that he was a fervent
305520	308580	Trump supporter In fact he was a very very very aggressive
308580	311600	Trump supporter At first I thought okay this is clearly a
311600	314200	parody account So I was just creating meaningless banter
314200	317640	to fulfil the controversy But scrolling down far enough I found this
317640	319640	absolute peach of a twitter video
335520	340520	He's a multi-billionaire And Ronald Reagan matter of fact he was a
340520	345480	TV actor who became president and is one of the best presidents we ever had in history
345480	351920	So even if Trump was just a reality TV star Reagan proved that you can come from entertainment
351920	354780	and media and become an awesome president regardless
354780	361200	So those two points totally debunk that whole stupid stupid liberal argument where how Trump's
361200	364280	a reality TV star he can't be president he's not qualified
365160	369840	After watching this the true scum of Joey Salads and his latest prank really emerged
369840	374280	Here is a man driven by his own political agenda of turning people against a community
374280	377760	in favour of Trump And yeah he can apologise profusely and make
377760	381520	up bullshit excuses about why this is the case but there's no excuse for this
381520	384720	His conscience could not have been clearer when he published that video and he knew the
384720	388200	exact implications Despite the transparency of this video I
388200	392240	mean look he has a fucking lead piping The foolish idiots just ate it up
392280	396440	Unfortunately the comments section has been swamped by H3H3 fans but initially there were
396440	400040	people who genuinely bought into this repulsive repugnant reptilian's rhetoric
400040	403440	I'm really glad this video has called out for what it is because if it hadn't and people
403440	407900	had believed this given the current racial climate the implications could have been terrible
407900	411520	It only takes one straw to break the camel's back and judging by the comments it could
411520	414960	have very easily escalated You don't know whose lingering prejudices
414960	420080	you could have fed and based on false information it's hardly justifiable in any case
420120	423720	The one hilariously stupid argument that ignoramus has always come up with is
423720	427320	Well it reflects all that's genuinely happening in America
427320	431640	Well mate if it's genuinely happening then why'd you have to fake it you asinine half wits
431640	436000	He masqueraded and invested Trump's supporting agenda in this facade of public interest which
436000	439880	is as inexcusable as far as I'm concerned and a simple apology video with a made up
439880	443440	story about how he was approached is just as phony as any other prank video
443440	446680	He's removed that particular video because of all the negative press however if you need
446680	451200	any other provocative content to fulfil your prejudices do not fear because all the previous
451200	455560	videos like the legendary bake car are still available for public consumption
455560	458800	Joey Salads is a cunt who does not belong on YouTube
458800	466120	Okay so Joey Salads is a bad person who knows what he's doing is incredibly odious
466120	470760	Well I'm pretty sure he does at least What's worse than that?
470760	475520	Well I found the cherry on the cake
475520	481280	I should know better now that I've met ya I hope I can alter my ways
481280	488400	But I've been a bad, bad man I've been a bad, bad man
488400	495440	I've been a bad, bad man I've been a bad, bad man
495440	499280	Ladies and gentlemen this is Fouseytube a special type of twat
499280	502400	This is a rarest specimen a person who believes he is a missionary
502400	506480	Here to be your inspiration on YouTube Well I can assure you that you have inspired
506480	510080	me to make a whole section dedicated to your highness Fouseytube
510080	513640	This one is for you I could go on about his fake drama or how
513640	517080	he's evolved into another generic vlogger with the personality of a fucking grapefruit
517080	520880	But as we're doing racially focused videos I'll stick to the subject and cover any extra
520880	523600	points afterwards We've seen the forced prejudice against black
523600	526440	people social experiment But let's mix it up with a forced prejudice
526440	530920	against white people social experiment Firstly remember that this one is also completely
530920	533920	fake as well In this one he has the hashtag blacklivesmatter
533920	537460	which is a great way to start off a fake politically charged social experiment
537460	541280	This video entails how people will react if a black person stole an item from a white
541280	545400	person and vice versa Now Fouseytube not only engineered the experiment
545400	548600	to suit his agenda and to feed the tension rather than actually fight it
548600	553140	He also plugged in an in-memory section at the end of his video to manipulate the emotions
553140	557200	of all the people watching and create this slimy veneer of unity to what is actually
557200	561040	a very divisive video The truth is simple however
561040	564700	When you make a video like that you don't do anything to stop the prejudices
564700	568440	People don't associate negativity with the realisation that there are race divides
568440	571820	In fact this sort of video will just make white people defensive and feed the prejudice
571820	575240	of others When the truth is really really much simpler
575240	579340	there are cunts in every race and religion and the best way to deal with this is to bridge
579340	584140	the gaps not to make them In the words of Martin Luther King hate cannot
584140	587780	drive out hate and hating in the name of love is one of the most contradictory bullshit
587780	591300	messages but it's one that Fouseytube has adapted very well
591300	595780	It's just as divisive as the Joey salad situation and probably even more deceptive
595780	600920	Fouseytube is a wolf in sheep's clothing There was a video on the internet a couple
600920	604740	years back where they paired homophobic people with homosexual people and made them maturely
604740	608300	talk out the differences and at the end the final goal was to make them hug each other
608300	612940	It was a very successful video and that shows the real power of positive association
612940	616860	Once again they didn't need to plug in a forced message to try and justify what they
616860	621140	were doing because they did it naturally There is nothing natural about this video
621140	625940	and that's only emphasised by the fact that it's fucking fake
625940	630580	How do we know that it's fake? Because Fouseytube admitted it himself but claimed all his videos
630580	634180	were done in good spirit I'd say he doesn't know better but he clearly
634180	638020	does he's just full of shit Now this is the point where I would thank
638020	641740	and reference ColossalersCrazy's video to Fouseytube and endorse you all to watch it
641740	646140	However unfortunately it has been taken down and Colossal given a copyright strike by the
646140	649700	Fouseytube himself In Colossal's video he systematically took
649700	653460	apart Fouseytube's videos and explained why Fouseytube is an absolute cunt
653460	657840	And Fouseytube being the crazed egotistical megalomaniac he is, striked his video and
657840	661500	took all the revenue from it All the fucking revenue
661500	667060	So on the 30th day that I had that video still under my CMS I got a tweet saying it's the
667060	671780	30th day and what did I do? I told my team to remove the video thinking
671780	674860	that would be that Colossal took months to make a video
674860	678880	He put time and effort to script, create and edit 45 minutes worth of content
678880	681980	More than any manufactured product that Fouseytube ever wanked over
681980	685700	And he has the audacity to monetise a video that's not even his and then get it taken
685700	688140	down It's a fucking disgrace and exactly why people
688140	691580	like Fouseytube should not be given the power they currently have on YouTube
691580	694620	The reason that Fouseytube has done this is because he doesn't want anyone to challenge
694620	697740	his YouTube golden boy image that he so desperately wants to preserve
697740	702580	He wants to inspire people, be this role model, he's a good person you see
702580	705220	Let me tell you this Fouseytube, you are a bad person
705220	709300	You have profited off prejudice, you've coasted off a career made by exploiting stereotypes
709300	712340	and you honestly want to stand and be this role model who's gonna tour the world and
712340	715260	give inspirational speeches and write a fucking book?
715260	720260	You want to shut down anyone, anyone who dares speak against your own self-centred image
720260	722660	You try to justify your good deeds by buying shit
722700	724380	You're an idiot, you know that
724380	726700	Buying stuff for people does not make you a good person
726700	730500	People like Al Capone and Pablo Escobar did a lot of community work
730500	733380	Unfortunately it didn't stop them from being absolute scumbags
733380	736460	And unfortunately for you Fouseytube, you're too thick in the skull to realise that it's
736460	740460	not how you spend your money that defines you as a person, it's how you fucking earn it
740460	743980	You're the American equivalent of syndicate and you'll grab the money even if it's not
743980	746340	yours It doesn't even matter how you fucking do with
746340	747340	it afterwards
747340	749820	And people are gonna shut the fuck up about charity work
749820	754340	Some of the worst human beings have done charity work to try and justify a false positive
754340	755780	image to manipulate the public
755780	757500	Not this time Fousey, not this time
757500	759500	Charity work does not right your wrongs
759500	761020	Bad people can do good things
761020	764420	Especially when those good things are done in a half-assed attempt to try and project
764420	765420	a false image
765420	769020	And this brings me to my closing statement
769020	773700	No one should be making money off dangerous hate-inciting content
773700	776980	It's only going to be demonetised when talking about sensitive issues like I have in the
776980	778420	past and I understand why
778420	780620	This must also fall under that
780620	782820	I really want to go in on more YouTubers in this video
782820	787720	Unfortunately most social experiments have not been completely proven fake even though
787720	790420	I have a hunch most of them are
790420	793100	Social experiments are dangerous when you fake them because you're feeding an image
793100	797160	to the public that will cause prejudice and tension which in America right now is the
797160	798340	last thing we need
798340	802500	Joey Salad and Fouseytubes are not affected by any of these prejudices because they have
802500	803500	a fuck tonne of money
803500	807060	If they were actually related to any of the victims of race-related crime, the unarmed
807060	812640	black civilians or the police officers, they would think twice, I'm sure of it
812640	813640	But they're not
813640	817600	They live in their own YouTube bubble driven by self-interest and taking advantage of the
817600	821700	emotions of viewers who don't have to experience the implications that this sort of content
821700	822700	might hold
822700	826900	That's the real threat and that outdo's any good indeed
826900	830980	If you're considering doing any social experiment with regards to race relations, I have a message
830980	831980	for you
831980	835600	You can do it, but if you do it, then the blood is on your hands
835940	840920	Don't be Joey Salads, don't be inspired by Fouseytube, both of whom are driven by the
840920	843160	incentive of a hidden selfish agenda
843160	847360	Make content that will actually ease the situation and work to stop this bullshit that is a danger
847360	850400	to society as far as I'm concerned
850400	854520	In conclusion, social experiments with a propagandist undertone should not be mis-sold to the public
854520	858500	as it endangers race relations for those who are actually exposed to living in more deprived
858500	863360	impoverished areas, the ones affected by the insidious message that these videos hold
863360	866380	In my opinion, they shouldn't be airing, but there's nothing I can do about it
866380	867380	Fuck you, YouTube
867380	872260	We can just hope that one day we'll see an end to these disgraceful, disgraceful, supposedly
872260	874760	social experiments
874760	879000	Do you think there's anything remotely defensible about the recent escapades?
879000	882400	Do you think Joey Salads and or Fouseytube are good people?
882400	885240	I hope not, but it's a free world
885240	889120	Leave your thoughts and comments in the section below
889120	892800	I'm the right opinion and I hope this doesn't get taken down
892800	893800	Fuck you, Fouseytube
