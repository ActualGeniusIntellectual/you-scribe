00:00.000 --> 00:08.020
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the right opinion of the home of a twat with

00:08.020 --> 00:12.360
too much free time and I am fucking exploiting that free time right now because by my calculations

00:12.360 --> 00:16.060
this video is going to be a 20 minute point so I hope you bellends have some patience

00:16.060 --> 00:19.300
I would assure everyone that this is a special and if it does do well I may do specials once

00:19.300 --> 00:24.860
a month or so if I can though I cannot guarantee or promise anything my free time has its boundaries

00:24.860 --> 00:54.540
Back it up, pack it in, let me begin, I came to win, battle me that's a sin, I won't ever

00:54.540 --> 00:58.060
slack up, hunk it better back up, try and play the role and you're the whole crew, well

00:58.060 --> 01:02.500
act up, get up, stand up, come on throw your hands up, if you got the feeling, jump across

01:02.500 --> 01:05.900
the ceiling, mugs let's all bump up, someone's talking junk, yeah we'll bust them in the

01:05.900 --> 01:07.740
eye and then I'll take the punks home

01:07.740 --> 01:11.140
Given that this is such a big event I need to introduce what this video is going to be

01:11.140 --> 01:13.340
about I'm going to be looking at social experiments

01:13.340 --> 01:17.060
and the recent chronology preceding this video, their creators and the implications

01:17.060 --> 01:19.940
that they actually hold I'm on the warpath today and you're going

01:19.940 --> 01:23.380
to be along for the ride with me, also I'm going to be focusing on racially divisive

01:23.380 --> 01:26.900
videos and the effect that they have on the society around them

01:26.900 --> 01:31.260
Now I know some of you will be saying but you said you want to cover YouTube drama,

01:31.260 --> 01:36.060
well you twat this isn't just YouTube drama this is social experiments and they are greater

01:36.060 --> 01:39.740
than YouTube they extend this to society and the impressionable idiots that believe the

01:39.740 --> 01:43.260
propaganda they peddle This is not just a petulant personal gripe

01:43.260 --> 01:46.380
nor is it just shit content which by the way it is

01:46.380 --> 01:49.820
This is me saying that there is a genuine danger to the crap that these channels pathetically

01:49.820 --> 01:52.680
pump out and profit from My intention in this video is to prevent one

01:52.680 --> 01:56.860
of these disgustingly divisive and derivative videos from ever surfacing on the internet

01:56.860 --> 01:59.720
ever again Which is a completely ridiculous far-fetched

01:59.720 --> 02:03.920
ambition but I feel if I shoot for the stars I'll have more impact on these extremely egregious

02:03.920 --> 02:07.880
vacuums of meaningful content I'm fucking going in and these cunts are going

02:07.880 --> 02:10.760
to bear the brunt of it But first a little background

02:10.760 --> 02:14.800
My first experience with social experiments was with the show What Would You Do an ABC

02:14.800 --> 02:19.120
series that began in 2008 and created stage scenarios to see how the general public would

02:19.120 --> 02:20.920
respond I was intrigued at the time and I watched

02:20.920 --> 02:24.480
a fair few episodes which human psychology does genuinely interest me

02:24.480 --> 02:28.020
Given the often controversial nature of the situations I was surprised by how passable

02:28.020 --> 02:30.640
it seemed to most people It's never really had much of an accusation

02:30.640 --> 02:34.680
of being fake though and to be honest when I watch it it does seem pretty representative

02:34.680 --> 02:37.720
which is probably why I avoided any allegations or prosecutions

02:37.720 --> 02:43.120
It had standards to maintain and although American TV isn't always the most real

02:43.120 --> 02:48.120
There was something believable about it Sometime a few years ago YouTubers discovered

02:48.120 --> 02:51.840
that there was a social media platform for these sorts of experiments and began enacting

02:51.840 --> 02:55.920
them to the oblivious public In my opinion the first videos of these social

02:55.920 --> 02:59.440
experiments were likely real with these said YouTubers finding their feet and working out

02:59.440 --> 03:03.660
the limits of their social experiments However upon learning their limits they realised

03:03.660 --> 03:07.400
in fact that there were no limits Not on YouTube at least

03:07.400 --> 03:11.320
As long as you were making them a fuck tonne of money then who the fuck cares

03:11.320 --> 03:14.640
And more importantly they couldn't prove your pranks to be fake

03:14.640 --> 03:16.760
But thank god some people have

03:16.760 --> 03:20.000
I have a lot to get through so let's start off with the most recent of controversies

03:20.000 --> 03:23.320
and the silliest of YouTubers Joey Salads

03:23.320 --> 03:42.160
All time looks like there's an Ebola outbreak in New York

03:42.160 --> 04:04.780
Joey Salads has been around long enough for me to be aware of his antics

04:04.780 --> 04:08.120
I have always had the niggling suspicion that his videos are completely faked

04:08.120 --> 04:10.560
And now the simplest of snapchats has proved it

04:10.560 --> 04:14.320
For anyone who has emerged from a 30 year coma and you're not aware of what's gone

04:14.320 --> 04:18.440
down recently Joey Salads set up a fake social experiment in which he dressed a car in Trump

04:18.440 --> 04:21.680
apparel and left it in a predominantly black area to see what would happen

04:21.680 --> 04:25.320
In barely any time at all a load of youths turned up and completely trashed the car

04:25.320 --> 04:28.880
In fact one of them had found a very well suited lead pipe in which I'm presuming he

04:28.880 --> 04:33.280
had lying around in his humble abode in case any Trump supporting vehicles entered the

04:33.280 --> 04:35.680
vicinity He concluded that because of this that black

04:35.680 --> 04:39.040
people must hate Trump And that in elaboration of this fantastical

04:39.040 --> 04:42.540
scenario he had people approach him and say they were scared to vote Trump because of

04:42.540 --> 04:45.440
community hostility Now with the emergence of this new evidence

04:45.440 --> 04:48.380
that proves this was all completely contrived and staged

04:48.380 --> 04:51.520
I would normally just dismiss him as another money grabbing idiot who just wanted to make

04:51.520 --> 04:54.320
a quick buck off racial tensions And he probably is

04:54.320 --> 04:59.680
However that's already been spoken about You see this goes deeper than a normal smash

04:59.680 --> 05:02.280
and grab If you were to glide onto his twitter and

05:02.280 --> 05:05.520
have a scroll through his tweets it wouldn't take very long to realise that he was a fervent

05:05.520 --> 05:08.580
Trump supporter In fact he was a very very very aggressive

05:08.580 --> 05:11.600
Trump supporter At first I thought okay this is clearly a

05:11.600 --> 05:14.200
parody account So I was just creating meaningless banter

05:14.200 --> 05:17.640
to fulfil the controversy But scrolling down far enough I found this

05:17.640 --> 05:19.640
absolute peach of a twitter video

05:35.520 --> 05:40.520
He's a multi-billionaire And Ronald Reagan matter of fact he was a

05:40.520 --> 05:45.480
TV actor who became president and is one of the best presidents we ever had in history

05:45.480 --> 05:51.920
So even if Trump was just a reality TV star Reagan proved that you can come from entertainment

05:51.920 --> 05:54.780
and media and become an awesome president regardless

05:54.780 --> 06:01.200
So those two points totally debunk that whole stupid stupid liberal argument where how Trump's

06:01.200 --> 06:04.280
a reality TV star he can't be president he's not qualified

06:05.160 --> 06:09.840
After watching this the true scum of Joey Salads and his latest prank really emerged

06:09.840 --> 06:14.280
Here is a man driven by his own political agenda of turning people against a community

06:14.280 --> 06:17.760
in favour of Trump And yeah he can apologise profusely and make

06:17.760 --> 06:21.520
up bullshit excuses about why this is the case but there's no excuse for this

06:21.520 --> 06:24.720
His conscience could not have been clearer when he published that video and he knew the

06:24.720 --> 06:28.200
exact implications Despite the transparency of this video I

06:28.200 --> 06:32.240
mean look he has a fucking lead piping The foolish idiots just ate it up

06:32.280 --> 06:36.440
Unfortunately the comments section has been swamped by H3H3 fans but initially there were

06:36.440 --> 06:40.040
people who genuinely bought into this repulsive repugnant reptilian's rhetoric

06:40.040 --> 06:43.440
I'm really glad this video has called out for what it is because if it hadn't and people

06:43.440 --> 06:47.900
had believed this given the current racial climate the implications could have been terrible

06:47.900 --> 06:51.520
It only takes one straw to break the camel's back and judging by the comments it could

06:51.520 --> 06:54.960
have very easily escalated You don't know whose lingering prejudices

06:54.960 --> 07:00.080
you could have fed and based on false information it's hardly justifiable in any case

07:00.120 --> 07:03.720
The one hilariously stupid argument that ignoramus has always come up with is

07:03.720 --> 07:07.320
Well it reflects all that's genuinely happening in America

07:07.320 --> 07:11.640
Well mate if it's genuinely happening then why'd you have to fake it you asinine half wits

07:11.640 --> 07:16.000
He masqueraded and invested Trump's supporting agenda in this facade of public interest which

07:16.000 --> 07:19.880
is as inexcusable as far as I'm concerned and a simple apology video with a made up

07:19.880 --> 07:23.440
story about how he was approached is just as phony as any other prank video

07:23.440 --> 07:26.680
He's removed that particular video because of all the negative press however if you need

07:26.680 --> 07:31.200
any other provocative content to fulfil your prejudices do not fear because all the previous

07:31.200 --> 07:35.560
videos like the legendary bake car are still available for public consumption

07:35.560 --> 07:38.800
Joey Salads is a cunt who does not belong on YouTube

07:38.800 --> 07:46.120
Okay so Joey Salads is a bad person who knows what he's doing is incredibly odious

07:46.120 --> 07:50.760
Well I'm pretty sure he does at least What's worse than that?

07:50.760 --> 07:55.520
Well I found the cherry on the cake

07:55.520 --> 08:01.280
I should know better now that I've met ya I hope I can alter my ways

08:01.280 --> 08:08.400
But I've been a bad, bad man I've been a bad, bad man

08:08.400 --> 08:15.440
I've been a bad, bad man I've been a bad, bad man

08:15.440 --> 08:19.280
Ladies and gentlemen this is Fouseytube a special type of twat

08:19.280 --> 08:22.400
This is a rarest specimen a person who believes he is a missionary

08:22.400 --> 08:26.480
Here to be your inspiration on YouTube Well I can assure you that you have inspired

08:26.480 --> 08:30.080
me to make a whole section dedicated to your highness Fouseytube

08:30.080 --> 08:33.640
This one is for you I could go on about his fake drama or how

08:33.640 --> 08:37.080
he's evolved into another generic vlogger with the personality of a fucking grapefruit

08:37.080 --> 08:40.880
But as we're doing racially focused videos I'll stick to the subject and cover any extra

08:40.880 --> 08:43.600
points afterwards We've seen the forced prejudice against black

08:43.600 --> 08:46.440
people social experiment But let's mix it up with a forced prejudice

08:46.440 --> 08:50.920
against white people social experiment Firstly remember that this one is also completely

08:50.920 --> 08:53.920
fake as well In this one he has the hashtag blacklivesmatter

08:53.920 --> 08:57.460
which is a great way to start off a fake politically charged social experiment

08:57.460 --> 09:01.280
This video entails how people will react if a black person stole an item from a white

09:01.280 --> 09:05.400
person and vice versa Now Fouseytube not only engineered the experiment

09:05.400 --> 09:08.600
to suit his agenda and to feed the tension rather than actually fight it

09:08.600 --> 09:13.140
He also plugged in an in-memory section at the end of his video to manipulate the emotions

09:13.140 --> 09:17.200
of all the people watching and create this slimy veneer of unity to what is actually

09:17.200 --> 09:21.040
a very divisive video The truth is simple however

09:21.040 --> 09:24.700
When you make a video like that you don't do anything to stop the prejudices

09:24.700 --> 09:28.440
People don't associate negativity with the realisation that there are race divides

09:28.440 --> 09:31.820
In fact this sort of video will just make white people defensive and feed the prejudice

09:31.820 --> 09:35.240
of others When the truth is really really much simpler

09:35.240 --> 09:39.340
there are cunts in every race and religion and the best way to deal with this is to bridge

09:39.340 --> 09:44.140
the gaps not to make them In the words of Martin Luther King hate cannot

09:44.140 --> 09:47.780
drive out hate and hating in the name of love is one of the most contradictory bullshit

09:47.780 --> 09:51.300
messages but it's one that Fouseytube has adapted very well

09:51.300 --> 09:55.780
It's just as divisive as the Joey salad situation and probably even more deceptive

09:55.780 --> 10:00.920
Fouseytube is a wolf in sheep's clothing There was a video on the internet a couple

10:00.920 --> 10:04.740
years back where they paired homophobic people with homosexual people and made them maturely

10:04.740 --> 10:08.300
talk out the differences and at the end the final goal was to make them hug each other

10:08.300 --> 10:12.940
It was a very successful video and that shows the real power of positive association

10:12.940 --> 10:16.860
Once again they didn't need to plug in a forced message to try and justify what they

10:16.860 --> 10:21.140
were doing because they did it naturally There is nothing natural about this video

10:21.140 --> 10:25.940
and that's only emphasised by the fact that it's fucking fake

10:25.940 --> 10:30.580
How do we know that it's fake? Because Fouseytube admitted it himself but claimed all his videos

10:30.580 --> 10:34.180
were done in good spirit I'd say he doesn't know better but he clearly

10:34.180 --> 10:38.020
does he's just full of shit Now this is the point where I would thank

10:38.020 --> 10:41.740
and reference ColossalersCrazy's video to Fouseytube and endorse you all to watch it

10:41.740 --> 10:46.140
However unfortunately it has been taken down and Colossal given a copyright strike by the

10:46.140 --> 10:49.700
Fouseytube himself In Colossal's video he systematically took

10:49.700 --> 10:53.460
apart Fouseytube's videos and explained why Fouseytube is an absolute cunt

10:53.460 --> 10:57.840
And Fouseytube being the crazed egotistical megalomaniac he is, striked his video and

10:57.840 --> 11:01.500
took all the revenue from it All the fucking revenue

11:01.500 --> 11:07.060
So on the 30th day that I had that video still under my CMS I got a tweet saying it's the

11:07.060 --> 11:11.780
30th day and what did I do? I told my team to remove the video thinking

11:11.780 --> 11:14.860
that would be that Colossal took months to make a video

11:14.860 --> 11:18.880
He put time and effort to script, create and edit 45 minutes worth of content

11:18.880 --> 11:21.980
More than any manufactured product that Fouseytube ever wanked over

11:21.980 --> 11:25.700
And he has the audacity to monetise a video that's not even his and then get it taken

11:25.700 --> 11:28.140
down It's a fucking disgrace and exactly why people

11:28.140 --> 11:31.580
like Fouseytube should not be given the power they currently have on YouTube

11:31.580 --> 11:34.620
The reason that Fouseytube has done this is because he doesn't want anyone to challenge

11:34.620 --> 11:37.740
his YouTube golden boy image that he so desperately wants to preserve

11:37.740 --> 11:42.580
He wants to inspire people, be this role model, he's a good person you see

11:42.580 --> 11:45.220
Let me tell you this Fouseytube, you are a bad person

11:45.220 --> 11:49.300
You have profited off prejudice, you've coasted off a career made by exploiting stereotypes

11:49.300 --> 11:52.340
and you honestly want to stand and be this role model who's gonna tour the world and

11:52.340 --> 11:55.260
give inspirational speeches and write a fucking book?

11:55.260 --> 12:00.260
You want to shut down anyone, anyone who dares speak against your own self-centred image

12:00.260 --> 12:02.660
You try to justify your good deeds by buying shit

12:02.700 --> 12:04.380
You're an idiot, you know that

12:04.380 --> 12:06.700
Buying stuff for people does not make you a good person

12:06.700 --> 12:10.500
People like Al Capone and Pablo Escobar did a lot of community work

12:10.500 --> 12:13.380
Unfortunately it didn't stop them from being absolute scumbags

12:13.380 --> 12:16.460
And unfortunately for you Fouseytube, you're too thick in the skull to realise that it's

12:16.460 --> 12:20.460
not how you spend your money that defines you as a person, it's how you fucking earn it

12:20.460 --> 12:23.980
You're the American equivalent of syndicate and you'll grab the money even if it's not

12:23.980 --> 12:26.340
yours It doesn't even matter how you fucking do with

12:26.340 --> 12:27.340
it afterwards

12:27.340 --> 12:29.820
And people are gonna shut the fuck up about charity work

12:29.820 --> 12:34.340
Some of the worst human beings have done charity work to try and justify a false positive

12:34.340 --> 12:35.780
image to manipulate the public

12:35.780 --> 12:37.500
Not this time Fousey, not this time

12:37.500 --> 12:39.500
Charity work does not right your wrongs

12:39.500 --> 12:41.020
Bad people can do good things

12:41.020 --> 12:44.420
Especially when those good things are done in a half-assed attempt to try and project

12:44.420 --> 12:45.420
a false image

12:45.420 --> 12:49.020
And this brings me to my closing statement

12:49.020 --> 12:53.700
No one should be making money off dangerous hate-inciting content

12:53.700 --> 12:56.980
It's only going to be demonetised when talking about sensitive issues like I have in the

12:56.980 --> 12:58.420
past and I understand why

12:58.420 --> 13:00.620
This must also fall under that

13:00.620 --> 13:02.820
I really want to go in on more YouTubers in this video

13:02.820 --> 13:07.720
Unfortunately most social experiments have not been completely proven fake even though

13:07.720 --> 13:10.420
I have a hunch most of them are

13:10.420 --> 13:13.100
Social experiments are dangerous when you fake them because you're feeding an image

13:13.100 --> 13:17.160
to the public that will cause prejudice and tension which in America right now is the

13:17.160 --> 13:18.340
last thing we need

13:18.340 --> 13:22.500
Joey Salad and Fouseytubes are not affected by any of these prejudices because they have

13:22.500 --> 13:23.500
a fuck tonne of money

13:23.500 --> 13:27.060
If they were actually related to any of the victims of race-related crime, the unarmed

13:27.060 --> 13:32.640
black civilians or the police officers, they would think twice, I'm sure of it

13:32.640 --> 13:33.640
But they're not

13:33.640 --> 13:37.600
They live in their own YouTube bubble driven by self-interest and taking advantage of the

13:37.600 --> 13:41.700
emotions of viewers who don't have to experience the implications that this sort of content

13:41.700 --> 13:42.700
might hold

13:42.700 --> 13:46.900
That's the real threat and that outdo's any good indeed

13:46.900 --> 13:50.980
If you're considering doing any social experiment with regards to race relations, I have a message

13:50.980 --> 13:51.980
for you

13:51.980 --> 13:55.600
You can do it, but if you do it, then the blood is on your hands

13:55.940 --> 14:00.920
Don't be Joey Salads, don't be inspired by Fouseytube, both of whom are driven by the

14:00.920 --> 14:03.160
incentive of a hidden selfish agenda

14:03.160 --> 14:07.360
Make content that will actually ease the situation and work to stop this bullshit that is a danger

14:07.360 --> 14:10.400
to society as far as I'm concerned

14:10.400 --> 14:14.520
In conclusion, social experiments with a propagandist undertone should not be mis-sold to the public

14:14.520 --> 14:18.500
as it endangers race relations for those who are actually exposed to living in more deprived

14:18.500 --> 14:23.360
impoverished areas, the ones affected by the insidious message that these videos hold

14:23.360 --> 14:26.380
In my opinion, they shouldn't be airing, but there's nothing I can do about it

14:26.380 --> 14:27.380
Fuck you, YouTube

14:27.380 --> 14:32.260
We can just hope that one day we'll see an end to these disgraceful, disgraceful, supposedly

14:32.260 --> 14:34.760
social experiments

14:34.760 --> 14:39.000
Do you think there's anything remotely defensible about the recent escapades?

14:39.000 --> 14:42.400
Do you think Joey Salads and or Fouseytube are good people?

14:42.400 --> 14:45.240
I hope not, but it's a free world

14:45.240 --> 14:49.120
Leave your thoughts and comments in the section below

14:49.120 --> 14:52.800
I'm the right opinion and I hope this doesn't get taken down

14:52.800 --> 14:53.800
Fuck you, Fouseytube
