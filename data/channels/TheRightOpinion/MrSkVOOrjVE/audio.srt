00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,020
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the right opinion of the home of a twat with

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,360
too much free time and I am fucking exploiting that free time right now because by my calculations

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,060
this video is going to be a 20 minute point so I hope you bellends have some patience

4
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:19,300
I would assure everyone that this is a special and if it does do well I may do specials once

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,860
a month or so if I can though I cannot guarantee or promise anything my free time has its boundaries

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:54,540
Back it up, pack it in, let me begin, I came to win, battle me that's a sin, I won't ever

7
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,060
slack up, hunk it better back up, try and play the role and you're the whole crew, well

8
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,500
act up, get up, stand up, come on throw your hands up, if you got the feeling, jump across

9
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,900
the ceiling, mugs let's all bump up, someone's talking junk, yeah we'll bust them in the

10
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,740
eye and then I'll take the punks home

11
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,140
Given that this is such a big event I need to introduce what this video is going to be

12
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,340
about I'm going to be looking at social experiments

13
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,060
and the recent chronology preceding this video, their creators and the implications

14
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,940
that they actually hold I'm on the warpath today and you're going

15
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,380
to be along for the ride with me, also I'm going to be focusing on racially divisive

16
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,900
videos and the effect that they have on the society around them

17
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,260
Now I know some of you will be saying but you said you want to cover YouTube drama,

18
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,060
well you twat this isn't just YouTube drama this is social experiments and they are greater

19
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,740
than YouTube they extend this to society and the impressionable idiots that believe the

20
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,260
propaganda they peddle This is not just a petulant personal gripe

21
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,380
nor is it just shit content which by the way it is

22
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,820
This is me saying that there is a genuine danger to the crap that these channels pathetically

23
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,680
pump out and profit from My intention in this video is to prevent one

24
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,860
of these disgustingly divisive and derivative videos from ever surfacing on the internet

25
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,720
ever again Which is a completely ridiculous far-fetched

26
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,920
ambition but I feel if I shoot for the stars I'll have more impact on these extremely egregious

27
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,880
vacuums of meaningful content I'm fucking going in and these cunts are going

28
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,760
to bear the brunt of it But first a little background

29
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,800
My first experience with social experiments was with the show What Would You Do an ABC

30
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,120
series that began in 2008 and created stage scenarios to see how the general public would

31
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,920
respond I was intrigued at the time and I watched

32
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,480
a fair few episodes which human psychology does genuinely interest me

33
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,020
Given the often controversial nature of the situations I was surprised by how passable

34
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,640
it seemed to most people It's never really had much of an accusation

35
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,680
of being fake though and to be honest when I watch it it does seem pretty representative

36
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,720
which is probably why I avoided any allegations or prosecutions

37
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,120
It had standards to maintain and although American TV isn't always the most real

38
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,120
There was something believable about it Sometime a few years ago YouTubers discovered

39
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,840
that there was a social media platform for these sorts of experiments and began enacting

40
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,920
them to the oblivious public In my opinion the first videos of these social

41
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,440
experiments were likely real with these said YouTubers finding their feet and working out

42
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,660
the limits of their social experiments However upon learning their limits they realised

43
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,400
in fact that there were no limits Not on YouTube at least

44
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,320
As long as you were making them a fuck tonne of money then who the fuck cares

45
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,640
And more importantly they couldn't prove your pranks to be fake

46
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,760
But thank god some people have

47
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,000
I have a lot to get through so let's start off with the most recent of controversies

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,320
and the silliest of YouTubers Joey Salads

49
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:42,160
All time looks like there's an Ebola outbreak in New York

50
00:03:42,160 --> 00:04:04,780
Joey Salads has been around long enough for me to be aware of his antics

51
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,120
I have always had the niggling suspicion that his videos are completely faked

52
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,560
And now the simplest of snapchats has proved it

53
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,320
For anyone who has emerged from a 30 year coma and you're not aware of what's gone

54
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,440
down recently Joey Salads set up a fake social experiment in which he dressed a car in Trump

55
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,680
apparel and left it in a predominantly black area to see what would happen

56
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,320
In barely any time at all a load of youths turned up and completely trashed the car

57
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,880
In fact one of them had found a very well suited lead pipe in which I'm presuming he

58
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,280
had lying around in his humble abode in case any Trump supporting vehicles entered the

59
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,680
vicinity He concluded that because of this that black

60
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,040
people must hate Trump And that in elaboration of this fantastical

61
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,540
scenario he had people approach him and say they were scared to vote Trump because of

62
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,440
community hostility Now with the emergence of this new evidence

63
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,380
that proves this was all completely contrived and staged

64
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,520
I would normally just dismiss him as another money grabbing idiot who just wanted to make

65
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,320
a quick buck off racial tensions And he probably is

66
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,680
However that's already been spoken about You see this goes deeper than a normal smash

67
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,280
and grab If you were to glide onto his twitter and

68
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,520
have a scroll through his tweets it wouldn't take very long to realise that he was a fervent

69
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,580
Trump supporter In fact he was a very very very aggressive

70
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,600
Trump supporter At first I thought okay this is clearly a

71
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,200
parody account So I was just creating meaningless banter

72
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,640
to fulfil the controversy But scrolling down far enough I found this

73
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,640
absolute peach of a twitter video

74
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,520
He's a multi-billionaire And Ronald Reagan matter of fact he was a

75
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,480
TV actor who became president and is one of the best presidents we ever had in history

76
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:51,920
So even if Trump was just a reality TV star Reagan proved that you can come from entertainment

77
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,780
and media and become an awesome president regardless

78
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:01,200
So those two points totally debunk that whole stupid stupid liberal argument where how Trump's

79
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,280
a reality TV star he can't be president he's not qualified

80
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,840
After watching this the true scum of Joey Salads and his latest prank really emerged

81
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,280
Here is a man driven by his own political agenda of turning people against a community

82
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,760
in favour of Trump And yeah he can apologise profusely and make

83
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,520
up bullshit excuses about why this is the case but there's no excuse for this

84
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,720
His conscience could not have been clearer when he published that video and he knew the

85
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,200
exact implications Despite the transparency of this video I

86
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,240
mean look he has a fucking lead piping The foolish idiots just ate it up

87
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,440
Unfortunately the comments section has been swamped by H3H3 fans but initially there were

88
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,040
people who genuinely bought into this repulsive repugnant reptilian's rhetoric

89
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,440
I'm really glad this video has called out for what it is because if it hadn't and people

90
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,900
had believed this given the current racial climate the implications could have been terrible

91
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,520
It only takes one straw to break the camel's back and judging by the comments it could

92
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,960
have very easily escalated You don't know whose lingering prejudices

93
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,080
you could have fed and based on false information it's hardly justifiable in any case

94
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,720
The one hilariously stupid argument that ignoramus has always come up with is

95
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,320
Well it reflects all that's genuinely happening in America

96
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,640
Well mate if it's genuinely happening then why'd you have to fake it you asinine half wits

97
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,000
He masqueraded and invested Trump's supporting agenda in this facade of public interest which

98
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,880
is as inexcusable as far as I'm concerned and a simple apology video with a made up

99
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,440
story about how he was approached is just as phony as any other prank video

100
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,680
He's removed that particular video because of all the negative press however if you need

101
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,200
any other provocative content to fulfil your prejudices do not fear because all the previous

102
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,560
videos like the legendary bake car are still available for public consumption

103
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,800
Joey Salads is a cunt who does not belong on YouTube

104
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:46,120
Okay so Joey Salads is a bad person who knows what he's doing is incredibly odious

105
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,760
Well I'm pretty sure he does at least What's worse than that?

106
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,520
Well I found the cherry on the cake

107
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,280
I should know better now that I've met ya I hope I can alter my ways

108
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:08,400
But I've been a bad, bad man I've been a bad, bad man

109
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:15,440
I've been a bad, bad man I've been a bad, bad man

110
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,280
Ladies and gentlemen this is Fouseytube a special type of twat

111
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,400
This is a rarest specimen a person who believes he is a missionary

112
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,480
Here to be your inspiration on YouTube Well I can assure you that you have inspired

113
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,080
me to make a whole section dedicated to your highness Fouseytube

114
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,640
This one is for you I could go on about his fake drama or how

115
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,080
he's evolved into another generic vlogger with the personality of a fucking grapefruit

116
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,880
But as we're doing racially focused videos I'll stick to the subject and cover any extra

117
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,600
points afterwards We've seen the forced prejudice against black

118
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,440
people social experiment But let's mix it up with a forced prejudice

119
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,920
against white people social experiment Firstly remember that this one is also completely

120
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,920
fake as well In this one he has the hashtag blacklivesmatter

121
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,460
which is a great way to start off a fake politically charged social experiment

122
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,280
This video entails how people will react if a black person stole an item from a white

123
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,400
person and vice versa Now Fouseytube not only engineered the experiment

124
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,600
to suit his agenda and to feed the tension rather than actually fight it

125
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,140
He also plugged in an in-memory section at the end of his video to manipulate the emotions

126
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,200
of all the people watching and create this slimy veneer of unity to what is actually

127
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,040
a very divisive video The truth is simple however

128
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,700
When you make a video like that you don't do anything to stop the prejudices

129
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,440
People don't associate negativity with the realisation that there are race divides

130
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,820
In fact this sort of video will just make white people defensive and feed the prejudice

131
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,240
of others When the truth is really really much simpler

132
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,340
there are cunts in every race and religion and the best way to deal with this is to bridge

133
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:44,140
the gaps not to make them In the words of Martin Luther King hate cannot

134
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,780
drive out hate and hating in the name of love is one of the most contradictory bullshit

135
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,300
messages but it's one that Fouseytube has adapted very well

136
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,780
It's just as divisive as the Joey salad situation and probably even more deceptive

137
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:00,920
Fouseytube is a wolf in sheep's clothing There was a video on the internet a couple

138
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,740
years back where they paired homophobic people with homosexual people and made them maturely

139
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,300
talk out the differences and at the end the final goal was to make them hug each other

140
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,940
It was a very successful video and that shows the real power of positive association

141
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,860
Once again they didn't need to plug in a forced message to try and justify what they

142
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,140
were doing because they did it naturally There is nothing natural about this video

143
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,940
and that's only emphasised by the fact that it's fucking fake

144
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,580
How do we know that it's fake? Because Fouseytube admitted it himself but claimed all his videos

145
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,180
were done in good spirit I'd say he doesn't know better but he clearly

146
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:38,020
does he's just full of shit Now this is the point where I would thank

147
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,740
and reference ColossalersCrazy's video to Fouseytube and endorse you all to watch it

148
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,140
However unfortunately it has been taken down and Colossal given a copyright strike by the

149
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,700
Fouseytube himself In Colossal's video he systematically took

150
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,460
apart Fouseytube's videos and explained why Fouseytube is an absolute cunt

151
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,840
And Fouseytube being the crazed egotistical megalomaniac he is, striked his video and

152
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,500
took all the revenue from it All the fucking revenue

153
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:07,060
So on the 30th day that I had that video still under my CMS I got a tweet saying it's the

154
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:11,780
30th day and what did I do? I told my team to remove the video thinking

155
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,860
that would be that Colossal took months to make a video

156
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,880
He put time and effort to script, create and edit 45 minutes worth of content

157
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,980
More than any manufactured product that Fouseytube ever wanked over

158
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,700
And he has the audacity to monetise a video that's not even his and then get it taken

159
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,140
down It's a fucking disgrace and exactly why people

160
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,580
like Fouseytube should not be given the power they currently have on YouTube

161
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,620
The reason that Fouseytube has done this is because he doesn't want anyone to challenge

162
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,740
his YouTube golden boy image that he so desperately wants to preserve

163
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,580
He wants to inspire people, be this role model, he's a good person you see

164
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,220
Let me tell you this Fouseytube, you are a bad person

165
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,300
You have profited off prejudice, you've coasted off a career made by exploiting stereotypes

166
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,340
and you honestly want to stand and be this role model who's gonna tour the world and

167
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,260
give inspirational speeches and write a fucking book?

168
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:00,260
You want to shut down anyone, anyone who dares speak against your own self-centred image

169
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,660
You try to justify your good deeds by buying shit

170
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,380
You're an idiot, you know that

171
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,700
Buying stuff for people does not make you a good person

172
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,500
People like Al Capone and Pablo Escobar did a lot of community work

173
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,380
Unfortunately it didn't stop them from being absolute scumbags

174
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,460
And unfortunately for you Fouseytube, you're too thick in the skull to realise that it's

175
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,460
not how you spend your money that defines you as a person, it's how you fucking earn it

176
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,980
You're the American equivalent of syndicate and you'll grab the money even if it's not

177
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,340
yours It doesn't even matter how you fucking do with

178
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,340
it afterwards

179
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,820
And people are gonna shut the fuck up about charity work

180
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,340
Some of the worst human beings have done charity work to try and justify a false positive

181
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,780
image to manipulate the public

182
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,500
Not this time Fousey, not this time

183
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Charity work does not right your wrongs

184
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,020
Bad people can do good things

185
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,420
Especially when those good things are done in a half-assed attempt to try and project

186
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,420
a false image

187
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,020
And this brings me to my closing statement

188
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:53,700
No one should be making money off dangerous hate-inciting content

189
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,980
It's only going to be demonetised when talking about sensitive issues like I have in the

190
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,420
past and I understand why

191
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,620
This must also fall under that

192
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,820
I really want to go in on more YouTubers in this video

193
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,720
Unfortunately most social experiments have not been completely proven fake even though

194
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,420
I have a hunch most of them are

195
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,100
Social experiments are dangerous when you fake them because you're feeding an image

196
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,160
to the public that will cause prejudice and tension which in America right now is the

197
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,340
last thing we need

198
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,500
Joey Salad and Fouseytubes are not affected by any of these prejudices because they have

199
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
a fuck tonne of money

200
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,060
If they were actually related to any of the victims of race-related crime, the unarmed

201
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:32,640
black civilians or the police officers, they would think twice, I'm sure of it

202
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,640
But they're not

203
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,600
They live in their own YouTube bubble driven by self-interest and taking advantage of the

204
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,700
emotions of viewers who don't have to experience the implications that this sort of content

205
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,700
might hold

206
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,900
That's the real threat and that outdo's any good indeed

207
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,980
If you're considering doing any social experiment with regards to race relations, I have a message

208
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,980
for you

209
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,600
You can do it, but if you do it, then the blood is on your hands

210
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,920
Don't be Joey Salads, don't be inspired by Fouseytube, both of whom are driven by the

211
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,160
incentive of a hidden selfish agenda

212
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,360
Make content that will actually ease the situation and work to stop this bullshit that is a danger

213
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,400
to society as far as I'm concerned

214
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,520
In conclusion, social experiments with a propagandist undertone should not be mis-sold to the public

215
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,500
as it endangers race relations for those who are actually exposed to living in more deprived

216
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,360
impoverished areas, the ones affected by the insidious message that these videos hold

217
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,380
In my opinion, they shouldn't be airing, but there's nothing I can do about it

218
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,380
Fuck you, YouTube

219
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:32,260
We can just hope that one day we'll see an end to these disgraceful, disgraceful, supposedly

220
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,760
social experiments

221
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,000
Do you think there's anything remotely defensible about the recent escapades?

222
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,400
Do you think Joey Salads and or Fouseytube are good people?

223
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,240
I hope not, but it's a free world

I'm the right opinion and I hope this doesn't get taken down

Fuck you, Fouseytube
