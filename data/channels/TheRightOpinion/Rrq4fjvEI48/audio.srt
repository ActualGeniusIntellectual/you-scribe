00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,200
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,600
too much free time and net neutrality under assault once again.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,800
Yes as always, Ajit Pai, the passionate advocate for a free and open internet is back and ready

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,640
to repeal those rippling regulations that have hurt consumers so, so badly.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,940
He's really a knight in shining armour to those who have suffered, and when I say those

6
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,040
who have suffered I mean the poor, poor cable companies.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,100
My heart has really wept for them over the last few years, I've had to watch them endure

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,700
pure torture.

9
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,740
Now I covered many arguments back in my first video which was aptly titled Don't Forget

10
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,900
About Net Neutrality, it appears that I haven't and here I am ready to argue against the new

11
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,420
points that have appeared to sprout out of the malnourished deprived soil.

12
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,160
After Ajit Pai was forced back into the bushes he has emerged once again with a 200 page

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,980
plus manifesto that no one can be bothered to read, but I assume he's spent a lot of

14
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,120
time on it, so he'll inevitably be pretty bummed if it's rejected again.

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,060
The main agenda, repealing net neutrality, the response from people all over the spectrum

16
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,340
has been universal protest, with many people outwardly signalling their distaste for Ajit

17
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,220
Pai and his obsessive scheme to remove that pesky government internet regulation.

18
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,540
However from the few voices that weren't self interested millionaire moguls, a clear trend

19
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,580
could be recognised, many of them are people trying to express damage control, they hardly

20
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,100
come across in favour of it, yet they still feel like you know what, everything will be

21
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,100
alright.

22
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,780
And to be honest, I do not know what will exactly happen if net neutrality is repealed,

23
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,740
and how it will affect Americans and so on, no one really does, but for me that's a risk,

24
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,060
a risk that's not worth taking, if it ain't broke don't fix it.

25
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,340
That's the current situation with net neutrality in the US, if Mr Pai really listened to the

26
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,900
consumers, he wouldn't be pushing so hard with these plans, yet he has knowingly disregarded

27
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,180
public opinion and is pushing for a clear reform.

28
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,700
I don't believe he's an extreme authoritarian who believes that his way is the best for

29
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,300
consumers and he's going to show them that he's right, I believe he has a few friends

30
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,420
in high places.

31
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,280
I think that's mainly understood now, any reform that only benefited the citizens yet

32
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,660
they overwhelmingly opposed would not be passed.

33
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,060
So the optimists say, well it was fine before.

34
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,100
Apart from it wasn't, I don't know if people were just unaware of certain unfolding controversies

35
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,180
or the glasses of nostalgia clowned up the judgement, but the past wasn't quite as peachy

36
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,620
as it's envisioned, especially during the few years prior to the introduction of net

37
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,620
neutrality.

38
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,820
From my understanding Pai and co wish to see their freedom returned to the Telecommunications

39
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,500
Act of 1996, and many people defend that as saying, well it was okay then.

40
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:30,180
However 1996 just isn't the same as 2017, so many new websites and networks have emerged.

41
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,460
What's also changed since 1996 is that these cable companies have slowly began to eat up

42
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,460
the rest of the market.

43
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:40,780
Verizon, AT&T and Comcast are basically buying out the competition, it's not the same, and

44
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,220
the silence of the problems were there.

45
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,420
We did encounter many of the issues that brought on the push for net neutrality.

46
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,120
The lovely old chaps at Comcast were already caught out for excluding their services from

47
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,280
data caps while enforcing them on other streaming sites, therefore it's no surprise that Netflix

48
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
opposes this move.

49
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,280
And hell, there's more.

50
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,640
Another article by Del Cameron on Gizmodo, which I'll link in the description below as

51
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,200
well, lists more incidents where competitors were locked out.

52
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,100
Just reading the examples is depressing.

53
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,500
Ajit Pai would make a fantastic politician, he only speaks in soundbites, dresses everything

54
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,000
up to make it look simply fabulous, and constantly dodges questions.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,320
People are frustrated in part because Ajit Pai doesn't give them information that they

56
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,320
can understand.

57
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,080
Sure, he can give them the 200 page manifesto, completely encrypted in date tip references

58
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,040
and jargon, but that's not helpful to the everyday person who simply doesn't have time

59
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,040
for that.

60
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,560
And the fact that he is withholding information and dodging questions should only be cause

61
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,560
for alarm.

62
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,040
We just can't hope it will be the good old days.

63
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,000
People are saying that this is just deregulation is wrong, it's transfer of regulation to the

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,120
market where there's almost no competition, a market where over half of Americans only

65
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,000
have one choice of internet provider.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,040
We are not in 1996 anymore.

67
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,700
The repeal of net neutrality is a threat because right now people are happy with it

68
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,700
as it is.

69
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,360
Ajit Pai is basically lying to the point where he can claim that somehow this bill will be

70
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,960
protecting the vulnerable of society, only to be contradicted by his own paper.

71
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,080
Ajit Pai is not an honest man.

72
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,560
Ajit Pai does not have the people's interest at heart.

73
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,280
I do my best to tell myself every day that if it does happen, it won't be that bad.

74
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,720
But he cannot be trusted.

75
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,440
And I worry that the people who will suffer are the independent sides, are the consumers,

76
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,280
are the entrepreneurs, are the innovators, are the people trying to get somewhere in

77
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,080
life, and for that reason there is no bone in my fucking body that could ever support

78
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,620
Ajit Pai's proposals.

79
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,240
The internet is fine.

80
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,560
Keep your hands off it.

81
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,360
I know what you want to do, but people aren't that stupid.

82
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,680
I sincerely hope that we do not let this go.

83
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,500
In the marketplace of ideas, the fact that I can take fruits from every stool is an essential

84
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,720
component of intellectual enrichment.

85
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,400
I hope it remains that way.

86
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,920
Anyway, any thoughts yourself?

87
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,000
Are we all doomed apocalypse now?

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Apocalypse later?

89
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,040
But let me know.

90
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,520
Until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
