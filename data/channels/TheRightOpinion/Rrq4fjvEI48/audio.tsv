0	9200	Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
9200	12600	too much free time and net neutrality under assault once again.
12600	17800	Yes as always, Ajit Pai, the passionate advocate for a free and open internet is back and ready
17800	22640	to repeal those rippling regulations that have hurt consumers so, so badly.
22640	25940	He's really a knight in shining armour to those who have suffered, and when I say those
25940	29040	who have suffered I mean the poor, poor cable companies.
29040	33100	My heart has really wept for them over the last few years, I've had to watch them endure
33100	34700	pure torture.
34700	38740	Now I covered many arguments back in my first video which was aptly titled Don't Forget
38740	42900	About Net Neutrality, it appears that I haven't and here I am ready to argue against the new
42900	46420	points that have appeared to sprout out of the malnourished deprived soil.
46420	51160	After Ajit Pai was forced back into the bushes he has emerged once again with a 200 page
51160	54980	plus manifesto that no one can be bothered to read, but I assume he's spent a lot of
55020	59120	time on it, so he'll inevitably be pretty bummed if it's rejected again.
59120	63060	The main agenda, repealing net neutrality, the response from people all over the spectrum
63060	67340	has been universal protest, with many people outwardly signalling their distaste for Ajit
67340	72220	Pai and his obsessive scheme to remove that pesky government internet regulation.
72220	76540	However from the few voices that weren't self interested millionaire moguls, a clear trend
76540	80580	could be recognised, many of them are people trying to express damage control, they hardly
80580	84100	come across in favour of it, yet they still feel like you know what, everything will be
84100	85100	alright.
85100	88780	And to be honest, I do not know what will exactly happen if net neutrality is repealed,
88780	92740	and how it will affect Americans and so on, no one really does, but for me that's a risk,
92740	96060	a risk that's not worth taking, if it ain't broke don't fix it.
96060	100340	That's the current situation with net neutrality in the US, if Mr Pai really listened to the
100340	103900	consumers, he wouldn't be pushing so hard with these plans, yet he has knowingly disregarded
103900	106180	public opinion and is pushing for a clear reform.
106180	109700	I don't believe he's an extreme authoritarian who believes that his way is the best for
109700	113300	consumers and he's going to show them that he's right, I believe he has a few friends
113300	114420	in high places.
114420	118280	I think that's mainly understood now, any reform that only benefited the citizens yet
118280	120660	they overwhelmingly opposed would not be passed.
120660	123060	So the optimists say, well it was fine before.
123060	127100	Apart from it wasn't, I don't know if people were just unaware of certain unfolding controversies
127100	131180	or the glasses of nostalgia clowned up the judgement, but the past wasn't quite as peachy
131180	134620	as it's envisioned, especially during the few years prior to the introduction of net
134620	135620	neutrality.
135620	139820	From my understanding Pai and co wish to see their freedom returned to the Telecommunications
139820	144500	Act of 1996, and many people defend that as saying, well it was okay then.
144500	150180	However 1996 just isn't the same as 2017, so many new websites and networks have emerged.
150180	154460	What's also changed since 1996 is that these cable companies have slowly began to eat up
154460	155460	the rest of the market.
155460	160780	Verizon, AT&T and Comcast are basically buying out the competition, it's not the same, and
160780	162220	the silence of the problems were there.
162220	165420	We did encounter many of the issues that brought on the push for net neutrality.
165420	169120	The lovely old chaps at Comcast were already caught out for excluding their services from
169120	173280	data caps while enforcing them on other streaming sites, therefore it's no surprise that Netflix
173280	174280	opposes this move.
174280	175280	And hell, there's more.
175280	178640	Another article by Del Cameron on Gizmodo, which I'll link in the description below as
178640	181200	well, lists more incidents where competitors were locked out.
181200	183100	Just reading the examples is depressing.
183100	187500	Ajit Pai would make a fantastic politician, he only speaks in soundbites, dresses everything
187500	191000	up to make it look simply fabulous, and constantly dodges questions.
191000	194320	People are frustrated in part because Ajit Pai doesn't give them information that they
194320	195320	can understand.
195320	199080	Sure, he can give them the 200 page manifesto, completely encrypted in date tip references
199080	203040	and jargon, but that's not helpful to the everyday person who simply doesn't have time
203040	204040	for that.
204040	207560	And the fact that he is withholding information and dodging questions should only be cause
207560	208560	for alarm.
208560	211040	We just can't hope it will be the good old days.
211040	215000	People are saying that this is just deregulation is wrong, it's transfer of regulation to the
215000	219120	market where there's almost no competition, a market where over half of Americans only
219120	221000	have one choice of internet provider.
221000	223040	We are not in 1996 anymore.
223040	226700	The repeal of net neutrality is a threat because right now people are happy with it
226700	227700	as it is.
227700	231360	Ajit Pai is basically lying to the point where he can claim that somehow this bill will be
231360	235960	protecting the vulnerable of society, only to be contradicted by his own paper.
235960	238080	Ajit Pai is not an honest man.
238080	240560	Ajit Pai does not have the people's interest at heart.
240560	244280	I do my best to tell myself every day that if it does happen, it won't be that bad.
244280	245720	But he cannot be trusted.
245720	249440	And I worry that the people who will suffer are the independent sides, are the consumers,
249440	253280	are the entrepreneurs, are the innovators, are the people trying to get somewhere in
253280	257080	life, and for that reason there is no bone in my fucking body that could ever support
257080	258620	Ajit Pai's proposals.
258620	260240	The internet is fine.
260240	261560	Keep your hands off it.
261560	264360	I know what you want to do, but people aren't that stupid.
264360	266680	I sincerely hope that we do not let this go.
266680	270500	In the marketplace of ideas, the fact that I can take fruits from every stool is an essential
270500	272720	component of intellectual enrichment.
272720	274400	I hope it remains that way.
274400	275920	Anyway, any thoughts yourself?
275920	278000	Are we all doomed apocalypse now?
278000	279000	Apocalypse later?
279040	280040	But let me know.
280040	282520	Until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
