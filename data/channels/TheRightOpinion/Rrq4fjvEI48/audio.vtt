Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:09.200 --> 00:12.600
too much free time and net neutrality under assault once again.

00:12.600 --> 00:17.800
Yes as always, Ajit Pai, the passionate advocate for a free and open internet is back and ready

00:17.800 --> 00:22.640
to repeal those rippling regulations that have hurt consumers so, so badly.

00:22.640 --> 00:25.940
He's really a knight in shining armour to those who have suffered, and when I say those

00:25.940 --> 00:29.040
who have suffered I mean the poor, poor cable companies.

00:29.040 --> 00:33.100
My heart has really wept for them over the last few years, I've had to watch them endure

00:33.100 --> 00:34.700
pure torture.

00:34.700 --> 00:38.740
Now I covered many arguments back in my first video which was aptly titled Don't Forget

00:38.740 --> 00:42.900
About Net Neutrality, it appears that I haven't and here I am ready to argue against the new

00:42.900 --> 00:46.420
points that have appeared to sprout out of the malnourished deprived soil.

00:46.420 --> 00:51.160
After Ajit Pai was forced back into the bushes he has emerged once again with a 200 page

00:51.160 --> 00:54.980
plus manifesto that no one can be bothered to read, but I assume he's spent a lot of

00:55.020 --> 00:59.120
time on it, so he'll inevitably be pretty bummed if it's rejected again.

00:59.120 --> 01:03.060
The main agenda, repealing net neutrality, the response from people all over the spectrum

01:03.060 --> 01:07.340
has been universal protest, with many people outwardly signalling their distaste for Ajit

01:07.340 --> 01:12.220
Pai and his obsessive scheme to remove that pesky government internet regulation.

01:12.220 --> 01:16.540
However from the few voices that weren't self interested millionaire moguls, a clear trend

01:16.540 --> 01:20.580
could be recognised, many of them are people trying to express damage control, they hardly

01:20.580 --> 01:24.100
come across in favour of it, yet they still feel like you know what, everything will be

01:24.100 --> 01:25.100
alright.

01:25.100 --> 01:28.780
And to be honest, I do not know what will exactly happen if net neutrality is repealed,

01:28.780 --> 01:32.740
and how it will affect Americans and so on, no one really does, but for me that's a risk,

01:32.740 --> 01:36.060
a risk that's not worth taking, if it ain't broke don't fix it.

01:36.060 --> 01:40.340
That's the current situation with net neutrality in the US, if Mr Pai really listened to the

01:40.340 --> 01:43.900
consumers, he wouldn't be pushing so hard with these plans, yet he has knowingly disregarded

01:43.900 --> 01:46.180
public opinion and is pushing for a clear reform.

01:46.180 --> 01:49.700
I don't believe he's an extreme authoritarian who believes that his way is the best for

01:49.700 --> 01:53.300
consumers and he's going to show them that he's right, I believe he has a few friends

01:53.300 --> 01:54.420
in high places.

01:54.420 --> 01:58.280
I think that's mainly understood now, any reform that only benefited the citizens yet

01:58.280 --> 02:00.660
they overwhelmingly opposed would not be passed.

02:00.660 --> 02:03.060
So the optimists say, well it was fine before.

02:03.060 --> 02:07.100
Apart from it wasn't, I don't know if people were just unaware of certain unfolding controversies

02:07.100 --> 02:11.180
or the glasses of nostalgia clowned up the judgement, but the past wasn't quite as peachy

02:11.180 --> 02:14.620
as it's envisioned, especially during the few years prior to the introduction of net

02:14.620 --> 02:15.620
neutrality.

02:15.620 --> 02:19.820
From my understanding Pai and co wish to see their freedom returned to the Telecommunications

02:19.820 --> 02:24.500
Act of 1996, and many people defend that as saying, well it was okay then.

02:24.500 --> 02:30.180
However 1996 just isn't the same as 2017, so many new websites and networks have emerged.

02:30.180 --> 02:34.460
What's also changed since 1996 is that these cable companies have slowly began to eat up

02:34.460 --> 02:35.460
the rest of the market.

02:35.460 --> 02:40.780
Verizon, AT&T and Comcast are basically buying out the competition, it's not the same, and

02:40.780 --> 02:42.220
the silence of the problems were there.

02:42.220 --> 02:45.420
We did encounter many of the issues that brought on the push for net neutrality.

02:45.420 --> 02:49.120
The lovely old chaps at Comcast were already caught out for excluding their services from

02:49.120 --> 02:53.280
data caps while enforcing them on other streaming sites, therefore it's no surprise that Netflix

02:53.280 --> 02:54.280
opposes this move.

02:54.280 --> 02:55.280
And hell, there's more.

02:55.280 --> 02:58.640
Another article by Del Cameron on Gizmodo, which I'll link in the description below as

02:58.640 --> 03:01.200
well, lists more incidents where competitors were locked out.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.100
Just reading the examples is depressing.

03:03.100 --> 03:07.500
Ajit Pai would make a fantastic politician, he only speaks in soundbites, dresses everything

03:07.500 --> 03:11.000
up to make it look simply fabulous, and constantly dodges questions.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.320
People are frustrated in part because Ajit Pai doesn't give them information that they

03:14.320 --> 03:15.320
can understand.

03:15.320 --> 03:19.080
Sure, he can give them the 200 page manifesto, completely encrypted in date tip references

03:19.080 --> 03:23.040
and jargon, but that's not helpful to the everyday person who simply doesn't have time

03:23.040 --> 03:24.040
for that.

03:24.040 --> 03:27.560
And the fact that he is withholding information and dodging questions should only be cause

03:27.560 --> 03:28.560
for alarm.

03:28.560 --> 03:31.040
We just can't hope it will be the good old days.

03:31.040 --> 03:35.000
People are saying that this is just deregulation is wrong, it's transfer of regulation to the

03:35.000 --> 03:39.120
market where there's almost no competition, a market where over half of Americans only

03:39.120 --> 03:41.000
have one choice of internet provider.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.040
We are not in 1996 anymore.

03:43.040 --> 03:46.700
The repeal of net neutrality is a threat because right now people are happy with it

03:46.700 --> 03:47.700
as it is.

03:47.700 --> 03:51.360
Ajit Pai is basically lying to the point where he can claim that somehow this bill will be

03:51.360 --> 03:55.960
protecting the vulnerable of society, only to be contradicted by his own paper.

03:55.960 --> 03:58.080
Ajit Pai is not an honest man.

03:58.080 --> 04:00.560
Ajit Pai does not have the people's interest at heart.

04:00.560 --> 04:04.280
I do my best to tell myself every day that if it does happen, it won't be that bad.

04:04.280 --> 04:05.720
But he cannot be trusted.

04:05.720 --> 04:09.440
And I worry that the people who will suffer are the independent sides, are the consumers,

04:09.440 --> 04:13.280
are the entrepreneurs, are the innovators, are the people trying to get somewhere in

04:13.280 --> 04:17.080
life, and for that reason there is no bone in my fucking body that could ever support

04:17.080 --> 04:18.620
Ajit Pai's proposals.

04:18.620 --> 04:20.240
The internet is fine.

04:20.240 --> 04:21.560
Keep your hands off it.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.360
I know what you want to do, but people aren't that stupid.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.680
I sincerely hope that we do not let this go.

04:26.680 --> 04:30.500
In the marketplace of ideas, the fact that I can take fruits from every stool is an essential

04:30.500 --> 04:32.720
component of intellectual enrichment.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.400
I hope it remains that way.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.920
Anyway, any thoughts yourself?

04:35.920 --> 04:38.000
Are we all doomed apocalypse now?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Apocalypse later?

04:39.040 --> 04:40.040
But let me know.

04:40.040 --> 04:42.520
Until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
