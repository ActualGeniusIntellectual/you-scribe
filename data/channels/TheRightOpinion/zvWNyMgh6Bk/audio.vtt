Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

00:10.800 --> 00:13.400
I think we need to discuss this, it's been long enough.

00:13.400 --> 00:18.800
Yes, because I had exams, those bellends thought they could put me to the test, well, not again.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.400
Not until the next set of exams, at least.

00:21.400 --> 00:24.400
God, my life is just one continuous cycle of despair.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.900
Boop boop boop boop boop!

00:25.900 --> 00:28.600
And on that note, I think it's time we talk about this situation.

00:28.600 --> 00:33.000
But let's start off with a story, because I know how much we love them here, on The Right Opinion.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.200
You see, I released a video on H3.

00:35.200 --> 00:41.200
I worked incredibly hard on the research, that brought it together, the points I made, and I gave it a lot of thought,

00:41.200 --> 00:46.600
explaining why I believe they strayed away from their original content, and this has subsequently led them to take a break.

00:46.600 --> 00:50.100
I took a very sympathetic point of view towards them, because of how I felt.

00:50.100 --> 00:52.200
I think there are a lot of people who've been there.

00:52.200 --> 00:57.700
However, almost immediately after I released it, I received a few comments pointing out that H3 got themselves

00:57.700 --> 01:03.400
in another shitstorm less than 24 hours before, leading my video to be timed fairly inconveniently.

01:03.400 --> 01:06.700
So what was this shitstorm? Well, let's talk about BetterHelp.

01:06.700 --> 01:10.700
Even if you're a YouTube casual, you probably will have heard of BetterHelp,

01:10.700 --> 01:15.900
the online interactive website that promotes therapy on an accessible platform, the internet.

01:15.900 --> 01:21.700
So to give you a breakdown, if you're a patient of this site, you sign up, and you fill out a basic form explaining what you're looking for,

01:21.700 --> 01:27.200
and what you may be experiencing, and what they do is that their extensive roster of allegedly qualified therapists

01:27.200 --> 01:31.000
will return to the alleged part in a bit, and they'll hook you up with one of these blokes.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.200
The ultimate aim? Well, generally to improve health, I assume.

01:34.200 --> 01:40.600
But if you've seen the title, you'll know that this is a video also about YouTubers, so where do they fit into this very enticing plot?

01:40.600 --> 01:46.000
Well, BetterHelp targeted a certain brand of YouTubers, in fact, ones that I like to talk about the most,

01:46.000 --> 01:49.400
the individuals who are seen as the moral bastions of the platform.

01:49.400 --> 01:53.800
This is no coincidence, these individuals have built special relationships with their fans,

01:53.800 --> 01:57.800
and unlike the Jake Pauls of this generation, they deal with more mature subjects.

01:57.800 --> 02:04.200
This is the sort of setup that is pretty perfect, and honestly the environment has been set up neatly for something like this to come into play.

02:04.200 --> 02:09.200
Now make no mistake, BetterHelp has existed for a few years, since its inception in 2013,

02:09.200 --> 02:16.800
it was always purring in the background, but recently one of their marketing executives must have spotted an opportunity in the fertile grounds of YouTube,

02:16.800 --> 02:23.800
which is a smart idea in principle. In the last few years, YouTube has become a lot deeper than just a place where people put on facades for the day,

02:23.800 --> 02:28.200
and I've spoken about that in length in the past, it just seems like a progression of the culture.

02:28.200 --> 02:35.400
Amongst a lot of these deeper topics that have popped up in the last few years, one that seems increasingly prevalent is that of depression and mental health.

02:35.400 --> 02:42.400
There are multiple reasons for this, I think the online world has brought together a new set of people who find themselves away from the turmoil of their real lives,

02:42.400 --> 02:48.600
and in that escape we try to find answers for the problems we face in our own minds, and one of those comes down to mental health.

02:48.600 --> 02:54.600
Depression and so on are complex topics, we need to be able to distinguish between when we may be experiencing mood dips,

02:54.600 --> 02:58.000
and when we actually have an imbalance that disposes us to be depressed.

02:58.000 --> 03:05.000
A great example of the confusion of the two was Prince EA's video, on how you're not depressed, you just shut up, and that.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.800
Also, it was great to see that Prince EA made the Mental Health Awareness Day on YouTube,

03:10.800 --> 03:15.400
after such an inspirational set of videos, YouTube really know their creators.

03:15.400 --> 03:21.000
YouTubers know that speaking about mental health is extremely sensitive, you can't be seen as taking advantage of the topic,

03:21.000 --> 03:26.200
but equally we are in a culture where people are being encouraged to be open about their experiences with conditions,

03:26.200 --> 03:30.400
and often being open about these things can help others, and we certainly shouldn't diminish that.

03:30.400 --> 03:37.200
On the other hand, we shouldn't be seen as clickbaiting it, or taking advantage of the possible experiences of suffering to emotionally manipulate our audiences,

03:37.200 --> 03:44.000
so ironically it becomes a whole different balancing act on working out how to appear genuine, which in a way is contrived within itself.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
But that's a topic for a different time, creators who address these topics in their videos will create a bond with their audience,

03:50.000 --> 03:54.400
sharing an experience, and maybe helping an individual to come to terms with their own struggles,

03:54.400 --> 03:59.400
so it made perfect sense to better help reach out to these lovely creators who are renowned for their reputability,

03:59.400 --> 04:03.400
to promote their therapy website, and help others make it through the same struggles.

04:03.600 --> 04:06.400
But there's a catch, in fact there are a lot of catches.

04:06.400 --> 04:10.800
You see, we over on the YouTube platform are critical bastards, particularly in commentary,

04:10.800 --> 04:16.400
and YouTube, although not being exactly quite on the level of attention as much that comes along with celebrity status,

04:16.400 --> 04:21.600
still comes under investigation from commentators and media alike, and BetterHelp should have known this,

04:21.600 --> 04:27.400
because regardless of what is discussed in the next 20, 30, 40 fucking minutes, I don't know how long this is gonna be,

04:27.400 --> 04:31.800
the fact that they've been caught in such a whirlwind of controversy shows they must have done something wrong,

04:31.800 --> 04:38.000
and it should be a lesson to them, but we'd be dishing out lessons all day today, like you're attending a college course,

04:38.000 --> 04:44.800
and this motherfucker right here is handing out scholarships, because really this whole thing goes a lot deeper than just BetterHelp.

04:44.800 --> 04:50.000
Today I'm going to be asking what is wrong with BetterHelp, if there's anything wrong with the YouTubers who promote it,

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
and if there's anything wrong with their responses, because my exams may be over, but we're just getting started.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.200
So without further ado, let's dive right in.

05:02.800 --> 05:09.800
Now, people have pretty much gone top to bottom of every single inconsistency within the website and its presentation,

05:09.800 --> 05:14.800
so when I clicked on, I expected to be mostly doing a clean-up job with a lot of the morsels left behind,

05:14.800 --> 05:22.800
but I was wrong, and I do have a lot to say, however firstly I'll give you a rundown of the set of controversies they've faced down in the last few weeks.

05:22.800 --> 05:26.800
I definitely recommend checking out PewDiePie's videos, this covers it a lot,

05:26.800 --> 05:32.800
their terms and conditions contained information that was rather sketchy, basically setting out the company as merely a third party,

05:32.800 --> 05:36.800
most notably even though they claim to run background checks on their therapist,

05:36.800 --> 05:43.800
they don't take responsibility if it's revealed that the therapist isn't actually qualified, a very unsettling clause,

05:43.800 --> 05:47.800
mainly for the reason that it might lead to employees being lax on the background checks,

05:47.800 --> 05:53.800
which might end up letting some unqualified and seedy individuals in, such as Dr. Al Dershberger.

05:53.800 --> 06:00.800
Now, Big Al here is under indictment for rape charges, I want to emphasise, as always, that an individual is innocent until proven guilty,

06:00.800 --> 06:08.800
and people losing their job over any fake accusations is a legitimate concern, however equally when you're having people in positions of mental health counselling,

06:08.800 --> 06:15.800
a significantly more sensitive job, it might be best to not give them a platform until the charges are heard out at least.

06:15.800 --> 06:22.800
You could also make the point that an individual's occupation should not necessarily define whether they should be allowed to operate in their position,

06:22.800 --> 06:28.800
this is not an unfair point either, but I feel that given BetterHelp's self acclaimed status as a facilitator,

06:28.800 --> 06:31.800
for them it might be best to err on the side of caution with these issues.

06:31.800 --> 06:36.800
Also, this is only a real source of criticism, because when it was pointed out, they quickly removed his page,

06:36.800 --> 06:41.800
which says to me that it was more about a lack of vetting rather than just a different philosophy.

06:41.800 --> 06:47.800
Equally, there are many people who provide testaments where their therapist didn't appear to be sufficiently qualified in their behaviour,

06:47.800 --> 06:54.800
at least towards these individuals, I think this raises one of the first greater philosophical concerns, BetterHelp is a large corporation,

06:54.800 --> 06:58.800
and there is no denying that there are many people who have had positive experiences,

06:58.800 --> 07:02.800
nor am I denying that there are an array of qualified individuals doing a great job,

07:02.800 --> 07:08.800
but there is an incredible shifting of responsibility which makes the website prone to such mishaps.

07:08.800 --> 07:14.800
With any hierarchy, there are people who are expected to be held accountable for the employment of their subordinates,

07:14.800 --> 07:20.800
and in a clinic, this is typically localised to an extent, although chains may have national managers and CEOs,

07:20.800 --> 07:26.800
you'll typically have some sort of branch manager who has that power, BetterHelp seems to have less of a structure when it comes to that,

07:26.800 --> 07:32.800
and although they have dedicated sectors, the lack of involvement seems to have alienated management from these issues,

07:32.800 --> 07:37.800
meaning that they had let their growing criticism slip through the cracks, and this was culminating on the review sites,

07:37.800 --> 07:41.800
although responses were predominantly positive, there was a significant proportion that were negative,

07:41.800 --> 07:44.800
and really there's a lot less room for error when dealing with mental health,

07:44.800 --> 07:52.800
and if these people had legitimate complaints, they probably should have been given more attention before BetterHelp decided to launch their platform into the public eye,

07:52.800 --> 07:56.800
however going on their website, the reviews are fairly positive, even with a video review,

07:56.800 --> 08:01.800
while some must have been particularly passionate to submit their experience through the form of a video,

08:01.800 --> 08:05.800
apart from the fact that this guy was actually a paid Fiverr bloke, and I wish I was joking,

08:05.800 --> 08:12.800
so the credibility of such testimonials comes under scrutiny, particularly given how generic and banal many of these reviews seem,

08:12.800 --> 08:16.800
and when comparing these testaments to the more mixed experiences documented elsewhere,

08:16.800 --> 08:21.800
this is all part of a greater point however, the marketing, as mentioned some people like BetterHelp,

08:21.800 --> 08:27.800
some people have had positive experiences, in fact it's very likely that a majority of people have had positive experiences,

08:27.800 --> 08:33.800
however the truth is that when your job is merely to provide a platform and some dodgy practitioners are operating

08:33.800 --> 08:37.800
just because they say they're not responsible doesn't mean other people aren't going to hold them responsible,

08:37.800 --> 08:41.800
they should have sorted out these concerns earlier, and instead we're here now,

08:41.800 --> 08:45.800
in response to a lot of the criticism BetterHelp founder Alon Matas posted a response,

08:45.800 --> 08:48.800
which honestly just made themselves look worse in my opinion,

08:48.800 --> 08:54.800
Matas basically set up straw men of people's concerns, talking about certain claims like the ones where the therapists were AIs,

08:54.800 --> 09:00.800
before saying how ridiculous they were, the simple truth is that even though some narratives were undoubtedly exaggerated,

09:00.800 --> 09:06.800
the concerns came from a legitimate place, and that cannot be undermined by pointing out the most far-fetched points of view,

09:06.800 --> 09:13.800
it came across as a very salty response, and make no mistake, sometimes YouTube, fandoms, etc can overreact,

09:13.800 --> 09:18.800
I think it's perfectly reasonable to criticise when people go too far, in my Zoella video for example I make that clear,

09:18.800 --> 09:25.800
but equally the context of Matas being the founder of BetterHelp and the apparent presentation that this is him defending himself against the allegations

09:25.800 --> 09:32.800
means that people will not perceive this response well, and although I think discussing whether people are overreacting is a legitimate discourse that needs to be had,

09:32.800 --> 09:38.800
it just doesn't feel like he presented it as that, on top of this he was so aggressive and braggadocious in the response,

09:38.800 --> 09:45.800
that it came across as extremely narcissistic, he brags about how this controversy has brought so many new sign-ups, like why?

09:45.800 --> 09:51.800
It didn't leave me with a feeling of confidence in him, everyone knows that BetterHelp has a lot of clients and many of them are happy,

09:52.800 --> 09:58.800
I'm not saying these aren't achievements to be proud of, but they're not relevant to the discussion,

09:58.800 --> 10:03.800
even the more ludicrous claims, it just feels like you're appealing to a greater morality to deflect the allegations,

10:03.800 --> 10:09.800
if we want to discuss the cultural impact of BetterHelp then we will, but the specific problems aren't alleviated by that,

10:09.800 --> 10:13.800
in the words of famous philosopher Brian Quang Le, it's irrelevant.

10:13.800 --> 10:20.800
Another very interesting fact was how Alan viewed BetterHelp himself, in one paragraph he takes the time to actually respond to one of the legitimate criticisms,

10:20.800 --> 10:25.800
and does admit that he made a mistake of including what are called the get out of jail free clause,

10:25.800 --> 10:30.800
and referred to it as standard legalese, which I think is one of the biggest problems with BetterHelp,

10:30.800 --> 10:34.800
they seem to lapse into these moments where they view themselves as a corporation like any other,

10:34.800 --> 10:39.800
and mental health isn't like any other, mental health should not have a market value,

10:39.800 --> 10:46.800
it's not a commodity to be bought and sold, and therefore having quote standard legalese that absolves your responsibility isn't really on,

10:46.800 --> 10:51.800
and does create legitimate concerns, however he admitted it was wrong so I won't give him too much stigma,

10:51.800 --> 10:58.800
but it's definitely something worth thinking about going forward, you are not just any old company who can simply throw down a copy and pasted terms and conditions,

10:58.800 --> 11:03.800
also we all make spelling mistakes, but once again, maybe just spell check a bit, just a thought,

11:03.800 --> 11:08.800
now we could finish here and get onto the YouTubers, but we're not finished, oh how I wish we were,

11:08.800 --> 11:13.800
because I said I'd give this an original spin, and this is where we come back to the marketing point.

11:17.800 --> 11:27.800
Now I have been doing psychology as a subject for a good few years alongside my politics, philosophy and international law,

11:27.800 --> 11:34.800
and part of what they teach is research methods, which is analysing and replicating the techniques used in psychological studies,

11:34.800 --> 11:43.800
so I became particularly intrigued when I noticed on their front page they boasted a 98% rate of individuals involved in their programs making significant progress,

11:43.800 --> 11:49.800
despite the fact that only 70% experienced an alleged reduction in depression, which is a rather sizeable margin,

11:49.800 --> 11:56.800
considering I'd assume a reduction in symptoms is correlated with the idea of progress, but still 70% is significant,

11:56.800 --> 12:03.800
and hey, they were conducted by the Berkeley Wellbeing Institute, sounds like a very reputable place, am I right or am I right,

12:03.800 --> 12:10.800
I mean how could I be wrong, I'm the right opinion, so I decided to take my expertise and investigate this study a bit more closely,

12:10.800 --> 12:15.800
after all these are some pretty noteworthy bragging rights, and there were two studies, two, not just one,

12:15.800 --> 12:20.800
so let's have a look at them and break them down and see if we can find any little mistakes.

12:20.800 --> 12:27.800
Now what may stand out to some people straight out the gate is the gynocentrism, which is known as the predominance of women in the study,

12:27.800 --> 12:36.800
and although definitely having 78 and 80% females can skew results, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that the pool of subjects was just restricted,

12:36.800 --> 12:46.800
a point that we'll address very soon, no. What immediately struck me was how they restricted the participants in the results to individuals who have been clients of BetterHelp for 3 months and 2 weeks at least,

12:46.800 --> 12:54.800
which will immediately skew results as it's a significant amount of time, and a high majority of people who are dissatisfied with the treatment they're receiving will have dropped out before then.

12:54.800 --> 13:00.800
Participant dropout is a considerable problem with any study, however with an overwhelming majority of research,

13:00.800 --> 13:05.800
normally a study will explain how these sample of individuals were taken, for example if they put out an ad in a newspaper,

13:05.800 --> 13:11.800
there is no clarification in this study, so I cannot possibly comment on the validity of the assemblence of such individuals,

13:11.800 --> 13:16.800
if these people were already intent on signing up to BetterHelp then you're skewing the study group's decisions.

13:16.800 --> 13:21.800
Now that may not be the case, but there is no comment on such, so how can I compare?

13:21.800 --> 13:27.800
And although they do comment on the participant dropout, they do not clarify how many participants dropped out, which is extremely suspicious,

13:27.800 --> 13:33.800
if they ran this study from day one like they claimed, they should have clear statistics on the number of people who exited the study.

13:33.800 --> 13:37.800
As they took questionnaires at the start, this should have been easy, and they need to include this,

13:37.800 --> 13:42.800
because to provide an example, if 90% of participants dropped out citing ineffectiveness of the therapy,

13:42.800 --> 13:48.800
then the 70% of the 10% left who experienced decreased depression symptoms, it wouldn't mean jack shit.

13:48.800 --> 13:53.800
I highly doubt it's anything like 90% dropout for your information, but they have to include that statistic,

13:53.800 --> 13:58.800
otherwise I find the contents of this study completely invalid, and I quote,

13:58.800 --> 14:05.800
This approach may have led to a bias, including people in the study who favoured BetterHelp e-counselling, wow, just maybe.

14:05.800 --> 14:08.800
I think these researchers might be onto something here, lads.

14:08.800 --> 14:14.800
On top of this, the study failed to use any control group to make the comparison of BetterHelp's therapy with regards to face-to-face,

14:14.800 --> 14:18.800
and although not necessarily a requirement with regards to the variables being used,

14:18.800 --> 14:26.800
given how one of their claims is the preference over face-to-face therapy, it bemuses me why they wouldn't take advantage of their most scientific opportunity to prove it.

14:26.800 --> 14:34.800
But as noted on their page, they do note that their clients have a specific predilection towards their content over face-to-face,

14:34.800 --> 14:38.800
so how did they source such information? As said, it was backed up by research.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.800
Well, let's talk about the second study.

14:40.800 --> 14:44.800
This study is much worse than the first one, because there is no pretreatment questionnaire,

14:44.800 --> 14:48.800
you could only respond to this questionnaire if you had already taken treatment for three months,

14:48.800 --> 14:54.800
which is unbelievably terrible methodology, like I cannot begin to explain how awful that is.

14:54.800 --> 15:01.800
I've already explained how this is a flawed approach on the first study, but at least they took the evaluations before the treatment, like come on guys.

15:01.800 --> 15:09.800
Anyhow, one of the other possible components of the other study was that they had 318 participants, not the most, but a decent amount.

15:09.800 --> 15:17.800
This study had the grand total of 48 participants for one set of questions, and 38 for the comparison of face-to-face therapy.

15:17.800 --> 15:26.800
So you know that 98% statistic that's on the front page? That was literally 47 people, and the one person who said otherwise was the 2%.

15:26.800 --> 15:30.800
This is some excellent data collection, lads. Excellent data collection.

15:30.800 --> 15:37.800
And as said, they had the perfect opportunity to conduct comparative research between the effects of face-to-face therapy and online therapy.

15:37.800 --> 15:44.800
Why did they decide to undertake such unreliable methods to provide validity to their claims when there were better options?

15:44.800 --> 15:49.800
Equally, in his written defence, matters boast that they've helped hundreds of thousands of people,

15:49.800 --> 15:57.800
and yet a study proving its success that is promoted on the front page could only gather 48 people. Only 48.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.800
I wish I was finished criticising this study, but I'm not.

16:00.800 --> 16:05.800
Throughout the study, it is infested with this annoyingly complementary tone towards better help.

16:05.800 --> 16:13.800
For these reasons, the present research enables us to begin clarifying the unique benefits of a high-quality and modality-integrated e-cancelling platform.

16:13.800 --> 16:19.800
This is at the start of the study. If a study sets out to prove how good something is, chances are it's a tad biased.

16:19.800 --> 16:24.800
There are many more examples of such high praise that I'll chuck on the screen now, I don't need to read them out.

16:24.800 --> 16:29.800
On top of this, the study fails to distinguish between e-therapy and better help therapy,

16:29.800 --> 16:36.800
as if better help has trademarked e-therapy, and it completely ignores the premise that there are already plenty of other online therapy sites,

16:36.800 --> 16:42.800
and therefore just turns into an extended ad for better help, and just equivocates better help to online therapy in general.

16:42.800 --> 16:49.800
To summarise, I'm not a fan of the study. It also doesn't help that the individual central to the Berkeley Institute well-being,

16:49.800 --> 16:56.800
Cheeky S. Davis, has a testimonial page, and on that testimonial page is a better help community and support manager,

16:56.800 --> 17:03.800
Noor Baker, who sings high praises for Davis, saying that she has been a vital part of better help's research efforts,

17:03.800 --> 17:08.800
so it appears that these people are quite closely associated, a highly personal team player, I'm sure.

17:09.800 --> 17:12.800
All this data is completely manipulated.

17:12.800 --> 17:18.800
Now in response to this information, Mr. Matters here may say, well, it's just a corporate thing, and that's true to an extent.

17:18.800 --> 17:27.800
I highly doubt that those L'Oreal adverts that show that 80% of women have skin that feels smoother after application are studies done under scientific conditions,

17:27.800 --> 17:32.800
but that's what annoys me. Better help seems to want to present themselves as better than your average company,

17:32.800 --> 17:37.800
but equally with that comes a level of trust. That means they can't just behave like any other corporation,

17:37.800 --> 17:41.800
they shouldn't be going around manipulating data, and they will be held to higher standards.

17:41.800 --> 17:49.800
Psychological studies are extremely important to the scientific community, particularly in working out which methods of therapy work best for the public.

17:49.800 --> 17:57.800
BetterHelp or Davis have taken advantage of this structure and made a study that looks appealing from the outside but does not warrant front-page claims,

17:57.800 --> 18:02.800
and having something like 98% made significant progress is inherently misleading.

18:02.800 --> 18:09.800
And this comes back to what's annoyed a lot of people, whether it's the very suspicious reviews, the failure to want to take responsibility,

18:09.800 --> 18:16.800
or this little debacle that I've just unpacked. It's the contradiction, on one hand they proudly proclaim the positive results they've received

18:16.800 --> 18:23.800
and represent themselves as this highly reputable site with scientific backing, on the other hand their conduct is very corporate and manipulative,

18:23.800 --> 18:31.800
which would be normal in a way for a business if it weren't dealing with people's mental health, and this is the epitome of corporate tactics.

18:31.800 --> 18:38.800
It's not what people want for such a website, you can't be the good guys while acting like that, you can't have your cake and eat it.

18:38.800 --> 18:43.800
But you know who can? YouTubers. Well, let's get a slice.

18:45.800 --> 18:52.800
With all this research, it may come as a surprise that BetterHelp has been promoted for a while by YouTubers all over the platform,

18:52.800 --> 19:00.800
many of them are people with strong moral grounding, DeFranco, Boogie, Jaxfilms, Shane Dawson, H3, some of whom we'll touch on later.

19:00.800 --> 19:07.800
Firstly, I want to talk about why on earth YouTubers would be so keen to jump on something so precarious, I mean we're dealing with mental health here.

19:07.800 --> 19:15.800
As PewDiePie said, anything like that is a rickety bridge, particularly when you're dealing with sponsors, some audiences won't want you even putting ads on a video about mental health,

19:15.800 --> 19:21.800
and although I'd say I'm arguably slightly more easy going than that, I can still see why it is a cause for concern.

19:21.800 --> 19:26.800
We have come a long way as content creators to move towards this more open era of discussion,

19:26.800 --> 19:32.800
however I think it's really important to emphasise that these individuals are only projecting their own personal experiences,

19:32.800 --> 19:39.800
and though these experiences may help you come to terms with your own personal conditions, the best course of action is to then seek confirmation through an expert.

19:39.800 --> 19:46.800
Now I do not deny that BetterHelp is a relatively professional site, however even they agree that they cannot provide formal diagnoses,

19:46.800 --> 19:51.800
but I'm sure there are a few therapists who haven't got that message given how discreetly it's been delivered.

19:51.800 --> 19:56.800
Point is, when you have a video talking about mental health and then say, and this is sponsored by BetterHelp,

19:56.800 --> 20:03.800
it does not serve as a fully endorsed supplement to the problems that you may be working on to discover, even they won't endorse themselves.

20:03.800 --> 20:09.800
Once again, it could well be a get out of jail free clause, but I don't think that makes it any more setful in those instances.

20:09.800 --> 20:18.800
On the other hand, I don't want to completely trash the concept of online therapy, as it can provide important support for those who have fears of even going outside,

20:18.800 --> 20:22.800
some people who may not have the privilege of affording face to face, that shit ain't cheap.

20:22.800 --> 20:28.800
And so when thinking about this, when the fact that BetterHelp emphasized these elements to many of the YouTubers who promoted it,

20:28.800 --> 20:33.800
many of them who've probably been in the same positions, I can understand why some of them seem very keen.

20:33.800 --> 20:39.800
I spoke to Boogie about this in a conversation, and one of the things that he said he did was try the site out for himself,

20:39.800 --> 20:45.800
and this is something that a lot of creators emphasized, and their experience with such individuals on the site was pretty great.

20:45.800 --> 20:50.800
So suddenly, what happened with BetterHelp was the shoe that fit Cinderella's foot for many of these YouTubers.

20:50.800 --> 20:56.800
Many of us are cooped up inside a lot, many of us do suffer from mental health issues, you have to be kind of insane to do YouTube,

20:56.800 --> 21:04.800
it's a draining occupation, because although in some ways it is easier, the networking and the business makes it a ruthless job to go anywhere,

21:04.800 --> 21:10.800
you really have to be willing to put in the extra shift, because there's always someone out there willing to go that one step further than you,

21:10.800 --> 21:17.800
and that environment won't just shape people, but it'll also attract people of that certain persuasion, and so the market for this was huge.

21:17.800 --> 21:23.800
This is likely why many YouTubers did rush to promote it, after all, they had their positive experiences,

21:23.800 --> 21:29.800
they saw the general feedback, and it all looks pretty affirmative, and many of these creators have done brand deals before,

21:29.800 --> 21:33.800
on top of this, you know, promoting something like this, it makes you look good.

21:33.800 --> 21:38.800
There's no doubt about that, whether it was their intention or not, promoting mental health stuff is good,

21:38.800 --> 21:41.800
you know, you might help people, and you'll come out with a better image.

21:41.800 --> 21:46.800
Many of these creators have done brand deals before, many of them are used to promoting content,

21:46.800 --> 21:52.800
and let's be honest, who reads the terms and conditions? Why should the content creators make an exception this time round?

21:52.800 --> 21:56.800
Well, because it's an exceptional situation, and it comes back to mental health.

21:56.800 --> 22:02.800
I'm going to try and avoid repeating myself too much here, but YouTubers can't go around and treat these sites like any other gig,

22:02.800 --> 22:05.800
it was unbelievably naive to think that was a good idea to do so.

22:06.800 --> 22:09.800
Now, I'm legitimately not against people being sponsored by such sites,

22:09.800 --> 22:13.800
however, it's even more important to be sensitive when you're actually going to be profiting off it.

22:13.800 --> 22:17.800
Once again, it's a sponsorship, I wouldn't expect anything else to an extent,

22:17.800 --> 22:21.800
but at the same time, a high majority of these people receive money per sign-up,

22:21.800 --> 22:25.800
and therefore, it was important that there were things being explained clearly,

22:25.800 --> 22:28.800
because you influence how many people sign up.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.800
Now, I will hold better help to account to an extent,

22:30.800 --> 22:35.800
as I believe they did fail to notify many YouTubers of the little clauses they had inserted,

22:35.800 --> 22:38.800
particularly one saying it's not an ample substitute,

22:38.800 --> 22:43.800
but responsibility should also fall on the shoulders of content creators for not being more ready to research it.

22:43.800 --> 22:46.800
Another problem that was definitely the cause of it spreading so quickly,

22:46.800 --> 22:52.800
was the fact that people just saw other YouTubers promoting it and likely judged the brand on the basis of that.

22:52.800 --> 22:55.800
As said, better help went after a lot of moral staples in the community,

22:55.800 --> 22:59.800
and once they were promoting it, I'm sure many other content creators saw it,

22:59.800 --> 23:03.800
and it caused a subsequent domino effect of unfounded trust in it.

23:03.800 --> 23:08.800
Building on this trust point, better help was also partly partnered with Philip DeFranco's business Rogue Rocket,

23:08.800 --> 23:13.800
and for some YouTubers being reached by a trusted member of the community probably instilled a sense of faith,

23:13.800 --> 23:17.800
even though, as mentioned in other videos, that was all it essentially did.

23:17.800 --> 23:20.800
Given the business model of taking a cut at the sign-up,

23:20.800 --> 23:24.800
better help could have as many YouTubers promoted as possible without losing any money.

23:24.800 --> 23:28.800
It's natural for companies to want more sign-ups, more money, and so on.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.800
I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with that,

23:30.800 --> 23:35.800
equally the YouTubers being used to promote this were definitely using their trust over their viewers,

23:35.800 --> 23:37.800
which is likely why the backlash has been so strong,

23:37.800 --> 23:41.800
because you're putting forward a case for a website that deals with mental health,

23:41.800 --> 23:45.800
and you're subsequently profiting off them, it has to be watertight, and it wasn't.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.800
I watched a lot of these promotions for these sites,

23:47.800 --> 23:51.800
and generally I didn't think many of the creators were acting in bad faith,

23:51.800 --> 23:53.800
I think they just didn't know better.

23:53.800 --> 23:57.800
Going forward, I don't think they have to plow through the terms and conditions for all their future products,

23:57.800 --> 24:01.800
though it's not a bad idea, but I definitely recommend being a bit more meticulous,

24:01.800 --> 24:04.800
at least for certain products, and making sure that what you're promoting

24:04.800 --> 24:08.800
is something that a person will be able to make a clear conscious decision to go into,

24:08.800 --> 24:11.800
particularly if everything is not as clear as it seems.

24:11.800 --> 24:17.800
The problem is that sponsors typically place a shared responsibility on the creator and the user,

24:17.800 --> 24:20.800
the creator to deliver a truthful perception of the service,

24:20.800 --> 24:23.800
and the user to make that conscious decision to involve themselves with the product.

24:23.800 --> 24:27.800
The problem with mental health promotion is that you're dealing with people who could be vulnerable,

24:27.800 --> 24:29.800
and thus may have diminished responsibility,

24:29.800 --> 24:34.800
therefore shifting even more responsibility to deliver an honest presentation onto the creator,

24:34.800 --> 24:39.800
and unfortunately because they misused that responsibility, people felt more animosity towards them.

24:39.800 --> 24:44.800
Now this immediately means that regardless of how earnest the intentions of these creators were,

24:44.800 --> 24:47.800
they were going to be staring down a significant amount of criticism

24:47.800 --> 24:49.800
because of the shortfalls of the site and the marketing.

24:49.800 --> 24:54.800
At the end of the day, they were equally a part of the marketing as the Botch study and the Forge reviews,

24:54.800 --> 24:57.800
and although they were likely misled, they're still autonomous beings,

24:57.800 --> 24:59.800
and they still have a level of responsibility,

24:59.800 --> 25:03.800
and as always on my channel, this makes the responses to such criticism

25:03.800 --> 25:07.800
just as important as the criticism itself, which is where we'll go now.

25:10.800 --> 25:14.800
One of the creators who was sponsored by BetterHelp was the YouTuber Domics.

25:14.800 --> 25:17.800
Now he's an animator, and as noted in previous videos,

25:18.800 --> 25:21.800
we already know that they have quite a tight relationship with their audience,

25:21.800 --> 25:23.800
and that manifests a lot of trust.

25:23.800 --> 25:28.800
Also, given the audience of such creators, it probably means that this could appeal to such a demographic.

25:28.800 --> 25:32.800
Following the BetterHelp incident, he put out this set of tweets.

25:32.800 --> 25:34.800
In my opinion, this was the best way to respond.

25:34.800 --> 25:38.800
He acknowledges the flaws, acknowledges the mistakes that he made on his part,

25:38.800 --> 25:42.800
and relinquishes the gains that he made of it due to his lack of awareness,

25:42.800 --> 25:44.800
and this is an important point.

25:44.800 --> 25:47.800
At the end of the day, whether BetterHelp is being misframed or not.

25:47.800 --> 25:52.800
Even if it was a great site, the lack of further research is something that would be a flaw

25:52.800 --> 25:54.800
regardless of the site's performance.

25:54.800 --> 25:58.800
If people were more familiar with the site, they could have either spoken to the site prior,

25:58.800 --> 26:02.800
and perhaps had some changes, or they might not have proceeded with such a sponsorship.

26:02.800 --> 26:05.800
On the other hand, they may have been in a better position to defend it.

26:05.800 --> 26:08.800
At this point, it's reasonable to hold up your hands and say,

26:08.800 --> 26:11.800
I was ignorant to these things. I don't think that's a crime.

26:11.800 --> 26:14.800
But it is a mistake given the context of the sponsorship.

26:14.800 --> 26:18.800
You have to vet a bit more tightly, which is why this is probably the best way to respond,

26:18.800 --> 26:22.800
because regardless of the context, it's a mistake that many of them were guilty of.

26:22.800 --> 26:26.800
Another thing that a lot of creators said was that they did actually sign up and try it,

26:26.800 --> 26:28.800
and many of them had positive experiences,

26:28.800 --> 26:33.800
and then wrongly assumed that their experience spoke louder than any individual problems.

26:33.800 --> 26:37.800
These are all mistakes that any associated creator can accept.

26:37.800 --> 26:40.800
I can accept them. Most YouTubers took that route.

26:40.800 --> 26:44.800
Many bluntly stated that they were ending any relationship with better help.

26:44.800 --> 26:48.800
Another fairly safe response. You don't want your words to be twisted.

26:48.800 --> 26:52.800
However, there was another way to respond, which is where we're going now.

26:52.800 --> 26:57.800
The sort of responses that we've just spoken about is when a person facing down these allegations

26:57.800 --> 27:00.800
can accept they've made a mistake, and be apologetic.

27:00.800 --> 27:04.800
The positives are that it often means that people are forgiving of us,

27:04.800 --> 27:06.800
and it means that hopefully we can move on.

27:06.800 --> 27:11.800
However, it can also be a negative, as if we feel that what's been committed isn't that bad.

27:11.800 --> 27:14.800
By apologizing, we push the standards up for what we view as wrong.

27:14.800 --> 27:19.800
Equally, if we apologize for too much, we seem weak, and too intent to please others,

27:19.800 --> 27:24.800
and then it creates the question of how we keep making these mistakes again, and again, and again.

27:24.800 --> 27:28.800
Apologies cannot be overused, or else they become disingenuous,

27:28.800 --> 27:31.800
and the whole notion of an apology implies that we want to do better.

27:31.800 --> 27:35.800
So apologizing continuously diminishes the meaning of each apology,

27:35.800 --> 27:38.800
and will make people more critical every time you try to do it.

27:38.800 --> 27:41.800
For that reason, this leads us to the other side of the spectrum,

27:41.800 --> 27:45.800
where there are some people who remain completely steadfast on what they've done,

27:45.800 --> 27:48.800
and are never prepared to admit that they've made mistakes.

27:48.800 --> 27:52.800
Now, I have to admit, I think even as the most informed person,

27:52.800 --> 27:56.800
it would be hard to defend a position in this situation without taking a hit.

27:56.800 --> 28:00.800
But there are people who do this in these sorts of situations,

28:00.800 --> 28:03.800
mainly because they shoehorn themselves into such circumstances.

28:03.800 --> 28:07.800
I understand the logic, sometimes by coming out against allegations in an aggressive manner,

28:07.800 --> 28:12.800
you can shut them down, but equally, if these allegations have more grounding than you anticipate them to be,

28:12.800 --> 28:16.800
you can come across as unnecessarily defensive and insecure,

28:16.800 --> 28:20.800
leading to increased suspicion on your involvement with such a predicament,

28:20.800 --> 28:22.800
which is where we lead to Philip DeFranco.

28:22.800 --> 28:25.800
Now, I made a sympathetic video in the past on DeFranco.

28:25.800 --> 28:30.800
At the time, it was my best performing video, and it was a great achievement,

28:30.800 --> 28:34.800
brought me lots of new fans, many of whom I assume are mutual fans of DeFranco.

28:34.800 --> 28:38.800
Hey there, if you're one of them and you're still watching, I appreciate your service.

28:38.800 --> 28:42.800
I stand by what I said in that video, these points do not change,

28:42.800 --> 28:46.800
but his response was definitely taking a page out of Alan Mattis' book,

28:46.800 --> 28:49.800
which isn't necessarily a good way to respond.

28:49.800 --> 28:54.800
Initially, this response was well received, but once commentators made responses,

28:54.800 --> 28:58.800
and even Colossal published one to the Bated channel, a lot of cracks began to show.

28:58.800 --> 29:01.800
Once again, as a response to many of the points that DeFranco set up,

29:01.800 --> 29:03.800
they weren't unreasonable responses,

29:03.800 --> 29:08.800
but the problem is that it was premised as a response to the whole better help situation.

29:08.800 --> 29:12.800
But Philly D was very carefully picking out points that he was responding to,

29:12.800 --> 29:16.800
and once again, if you want to defend yourself against some of the more ridiculous allegations,

29:16.800 --> 29:20.800
it's not a bad position, but there is less acknowledgement of wrongdoing

29:20.800 --> 29:22.800
than in Alan's hackneyed response.

29:22.800 --> 29:25.800
I think this is aggravated by the fact that Philip said this.

29:25.800 --> 29:28.800
And also to everyone in general, I apologize if I end up repeating things,

29:28.800 --> 29:32.800
I know I talked about this last Thursday, but I think just in one dedicated setting,

29:32.800 --> 29:35.800
it's important that I hit on all the notes,

29:35.800 --> 29:38.800
since for some reason, depending on who is talking about this story,

29:38.800 --> 29:43.800
certain parts are excluded, or glossed over, or exaggerated, or misconstrued.

29:43.800 --> 29:45.800
And this is probably true to an extent,

29:45.800 --> 29:48.800
but it's very clear that Philip's portrayal isn't comprehensive either.

29:48.800 --> 29:50.800
BetterHelp has been a sponsor of our videos,

29:50.800 --> 29:52.800
we've even partnered with them at a company level

29:52.800 --> 29:54.800
to help them with other sponsorships with other YouTubers,

29:54.800 --> 29:56.800
and so that clip has been misconstrued as,

29:56.800 --> 29:59.800
oh, that's the smoking gun, that is the evidence that Philip DeFranco,

29:59.800 --> 30:02.800
he is invested, he is part of the, he is the mastermind.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.800
Well, I wouldn't use the term smoking gun,

30:04.800 --> 30:07.800
but it could be, in the sense you didn't reveal you were partnered with BetterHelp

30:07.800 --> 30:09.800
before you sponsored with them.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.800
You've now clarified that your first sponsorship with them was made

30:11.800 --> 30:14.800
before you partnered with them, which is fine,

30:14.800 --> 30:16.800
but what about all the others you did after that?

30:16.800 --> 30:20.800
There's a lack of transparency here, which should be an obvious concern to anyone,

30:20.800 --> 30:23.800
because you're promoting something that you've got an invested interest in.

30:23.800 --> 30:26.800
And it's one that goes beyond your standard sponsorship, I think.

30:26.800 --> 30:30.800
That doesn't have to mean you've literally invested in BetterHelp yourself,

30:30.800 --> 30:34.800
but not disclosing your partnership makes all your sponsorships,

30:34.800 --> 30:37.800
other than the first one now, a clear conflict of interest.

30:37.800 --> 30:40.800
Sit down and ask yourself if you benefit from BetterHelp's success

30:40.800 --> 30:44.800
even without a DeFranco sponsorship, and the answer will be yes.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.800
And once this was observed by other creators,

30:46.800 --> 30:48.800
he quickly fell victim to the consequences.

30:48.800 --> 30:50.800
Responding to criticism is a balancing act,

30:50.800 --> 30:53.800
knowing when to apologise, and knowing when to rebut.

30:53.800 --> 30:56.800
And DeFranco clearly has a faith in BetterHelp,

30:56.800 --> 30:58.800
maybe a product of his investment,

30:58.800 --> 31:02.800
but the problem is that people have already taken that point of view into account,

31:02.800 --> 31:05.800
and therefore DeFranco's presentation for these critics

31:05.800 --> 31:08.800
have this delusion about BetterHelp that needs to be corrected

31:08.800 --> 31:10.800
before we can even have a discussion,

31:10.800 --> 31:13.800
a discussion that DeFranco doesn't even get to in the video,

31:13.800 --> 31:15.800
is inherently condescending.

31:15.800 --> 31:19.800
It's clear that DeFranco wanted to keep BetterHelp in positive standing with the video,

31:19.800 --> 31:23.800
and defend its position, and really, he may have been the person to do that,

31:23.800 --> 31:25.800
but I think it was a lose-lose predicament,

31:25.800 --> 31:27.800
that if he had addressed the worst arguments,

31:27.800 --> 31:30.800
people would call him out for not addressing the best ones,

31:30.800 --> 31:33.800
and if he addressed the best ones, he'd probably have a hard time,

31:33.800 --> 31:34.800
because you can't counter them,

31:34.800 --> 31:38.800
particularly when BetterHelp had already pulled pages and information

31:38.800 --> 31:39.800
that had been criticised,

31:39.800 --> 31:43.800
meaning that they had already implicitly admitted they'd made such mistakes.

31:43.800 --> 31:46.800
So the only argument that you can make is that BetterHelp,

31:46.800 --> 31:50.800
as a greater product, hasn't been that tainted,

31:50.800 --> 31:53.800
and that argument just wouldn't wash with viewers in the current state.

31:53.800 --> 31:56.800
So DeFranco arguably did the best he could with the quote,

31:56.800 --> 31:58.800
defensive argument, but it wasn't enough,

31:58.800 --> 32:01.800
and in my opinion, he should have accepted there were mistakes,

32:01.800 --> 32:02.800
and just admitted it.

32:02.800 --> 32:04.800
I don't think there was any way out of it.

32:04.800 --> 32:07.800
One of the aspects DeFranco mentioned in his video

32:07.800 --> 32:10.800
was that he would be taking a trip to the headquarters of BetterHelp

32:10.800 --> 32:12.800
to ascertain their mode of operation.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.800
To me, it seemed like a fairly harmless venture,

32:14.800 --> 32:16.800
but one that wouldn't really change anything.

32:16.800 --> 32:20.800
Following this, he uploaded this post explaining his position on it,

32:20.800 --> 32:22.800
and honestly, I read the first paragraph,

32:22.800 --> 32:24.800
and it seemed like he was making a lot of sense.

32:24.800 --> 32:25.800
But then he says this,

32:25.800 --> 32:28.800
With that all said, we'll be fully ending our relationship with BetterHelp.

32:28.800 --> 32:31.800
This is not based on anything that came from the meeting,

32:31.800 --> 32:34.800
but from a place of understanding that part of the community

32:34.800 --> 32:37.800
just does not feel it as appropriate to have a sponsorship with a company

32:37.800 --> 32:39.800
in the mental health space.

32:39.800 --> 32:41.800
And this annoyed me. It did.

32:41.800 --> 32:44.800
And I'm a fairly placid person, so it must mean something.

32:44.800 --> 32:46.800
I want to say something about it.

32:50.800 --> 32:54.800
It's not that people weren't ready for a sponsorship with mental health.

32:54.800 --> 32:56.800
There are many of us who accept that under the premise,

32:56.800 --> 32:57.800
this could be a good idea.

32:57.800 --> 33:00.800
This could be something that works and changes lives.

33:00.800 --> 33:03.800
And for a while, many people promoted BetterHelp without repercussions.

33:03.800 --> 33:05.800
Sure, there were some people who were protesting it,

33:05.800 --> 33:07.800
but they're not people who caused this.

33:07.800 --> 33:10.800
No, what caused this was the shifting tide in public sentiment

33:10.800 --> 33:13.800
about the credibility of the website, based on significant problems

33:13.800 --> 33:15.800
which they themselves clearly submitted to.

33:15.800 --> 33:18.800
Yes, people probably had bad experiences with therapists,

33:18.800 --> 33:22.800
and obviously, in light of scandals, these complaints came to the forefront of the discourse.

33:22.800 --> 33:26.800
But at the same time, this was equally a deeper problem with marketing and philosophy.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.800
Shifting responsibility onto the community,

33:28.800 --> 33:31.800
as if they're not happy with any mental health websites at all,

33:31.800 --> 33:33.800
just seems like a kick in the teeth.

33:33.800 --> 33:36.800
Barely a few lines after you admitted that they had problems,

33:36.800 --> 33:38.800
whether you consider them derisory or not.

33:38.800 --> 33:41.800
YouTubers have this real problem of understanding sometimes.

33:41.800 --> 33:44.800
Besides the stories that have come to light of recent,

33:44.800 --> 33:46.800
it's what an environment like that can breed.

33:46.800 --> 33:51.800
It's the potential, when people see companies shifting responsibility with such clauses,

33:51.800 --> 33:53.800
when people see companies manipulating their market,

33:53.800 --> 33:56.800
whether the service is good right now is besides the point,

33:56.800 --> 33:59.800
because when you have a company that's willing to behave like that,

33:59.800 --> 34:02.800
people lose trust because of what might happen in the future,

34:02.800 --> 34:04.800
and what they might let happen.

34:04.800 --> 34:06.800
In my opinion, you should be empathetic to that.

34:06.800 --> 34:10.800
People were right to criticize it because it gave them too much leverage

34:10.800 --> 34:12.800
for exploitation to occur within that site,

34:12.800 --> 34:16.800
and for you to then say that you'd heard the stories that people had told you,

34:16.800 --> 34:19.800
and you presented them to them at the BetterHelp headquarters,

34:19.800 --> 34:22.800
and then going back to conclude that there was a community

34:22.800 --> 34:24.800
who just wasn't cool with mental health is audacious,

34:24.800 --> 34:26.800
as if we were the ones responsible.

34:26.800 --> 34:29.800
We don't have to change. We should be critical.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.800
We should drive home these principles of companies being honest,

34:32.800 --> 34:34.800
whether it's in the advertising or in the fine print,

34:34.800 --> 34:36.800
particularly when dealing with the issue of mental health.

34:36.800 --> 34:40.800
It's not dollar-shave club sponsorship where the results are fairly consistent,

34:40.800 --> 34:43.800
and you'll get a nice clean-shaven chinny-chin-chin.

34:43.800 --> 34:45.800
There is an immense amount of trust being levied here.

34:45.800 --> 34:48.800
It is the company that needs to change, not us.

34:48.800 --> 34:51.800
Whether it was the fake testimonials, the get-out-of-jail-free clauses,

34:51.800 --> 34:55.800
or the pseudo-scientific study that was being used to try and elevate their results,

34:55.800 --> 34:59.800
they were the ones who weren't ready, not us.

34:59.800 --> 35:02.800
I spoke to a lot of community members, a lot of content creators,

35:02.800 --> 35:05.800
and the sentiment was that they wanted to promote and support this,

35:05.800 --> 35:09.800
but they found themselves ultimately in a corner where the company they wanted to support

35:09.800 --> 35:11.800
hadn't presented themselves honestly.

35:11.800 --> 35:16.800
And as marketers and beneficiaries, they became implicated in this.

35:16.800 --> 35:20.800
When people sign up to BetterHelp, it was presented like it was a substitute,

35:20.800 --> 35:22.800
so it became an assumption to the viewer.

35:22.800 --> 35:25.800
The only thing that was constantly mentioned in the BetterHelp adverts

35:25.800 --> 35:27.800
were that it wasn't an emergency hotline.

35:27.800 --> 35:29.800
Other than that, no details were given.

35:29.800 --> 35:33.800
It is also assumed that the people who hired the therapists, BetterHelp themselves,

35:33.800 --> 35:35.800
would take some level of responsibility.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.800
It is instinctively assumed that the reviews were honest,

35:37.800 --> 35:41.800
the research is honest, with content creators using that trust.

35:41.800 --> 35:44.800
Promoting this, they became the source of the statement

35:44.800 --> 35:46.800
because they had promoted these assumptions,

35:46.800 --> 35:49.800
that although I believe they assumed too, they should have known better,

35:49.800 --> 35:54.800
because the trust that their audience has in them reinforces those assumptions.

35:54.800 --> 35:56.800
One of the things about mental health is its uniqueness.

35:56.800 --> 35:58.800
No two people have the same mentality.

35:58.800 --> 36:01.800
It's all one huge mess, and we on YouTube, we're all messes.

36:01.800 --> 36:03.800
Nothing is new about that.

36:03.800 --> 36:07.800
But we need to be clear in what's being offered and who it's being offered to.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.800
Signing up to BetterHelp and having a good experience

36:09.800 --> 36:12.800
isn't evidence that every experience is going to be good.

36:12.800 --> 36:15.800
YouTubers share a lot of mental health experiences and I think it's important,

36:15.800 --> 36:18.800
and often the overarching narratives of their stories

36:18.800 --> 36:20.800
can touch on a general struggle that is felt by many.

36:20.800 --> 36:23.800
But equally, they shouldn't equate this to everyone's struggle,

36:23.800 --> 36:26.800
and in this instance, they need to look at the roots of what they were supporting

36:26.800 --> 36:30.800
rather than just the singular experience that they had and working outwards.

36:30.800 --> 36:33.800
They need to go bottom up rather than top down.

36:33.800 --> 36:38.800
To understand mental health is different to just experiencing the complications facing it,

36:38.800 --> 36:40.800
and it's a tricky, tight-rope to tread.

36:40.800 --> 36:43.800
I think that going forward, everyone has a responsibility to know what they're promoting

36:43.800 --> 36:46.800
will be right for their audience when it comes to sensitive topics,

36:46.800 --> 36:49.800
because I do believe in some perks of online therapy.

36:49.800 --> 36:52.800
It won't be for everyone, but for those people, it may be an important first step.

36:52.800 --> 36:57.800
For people who have problems leaving the house and such, these are real changes that can be made.

36:57.800 --> 37:01.800
I don't want this video to be just a bashing of the premise of online therapy.

37:01.800 --> 37:04.800
No, I'm just bashing this execution.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.800
It's a message to those who should do better.

37:06.800 --> 37:09.800
When you can do better, why wouldn't you?

37:09.800 --> 37:12.800
I want to close this video by providing you with a little allegory

37:12.800 --> 37:16.800
from my current philosophy professor, who was actually a really interesting bloke.

37:16.800 --> 37:20.800
Big props to him for being one of the first tutors to make philosophy interesting.

37:20.800 --> 37:24.800
And he said that when dealing with much of the moral philosophy that we were covering,

37:24.800 --> 37:27.800
that moral arguments are like a speed limit we set.

37:27.800 --> 37:30.800
We can't expect that everyone will drive within that speed limit.

37:30.800 --> 37:34.800
Many people will behave outside of what is considered acceptable from time to time.

37:34.800 --> 37:39.800
By setting the speed limit, we move that responsibility onto the driver,

37:39.800 --> 37:41.800
and they become accountable for their actions.

37:41.800 --> 37:45.800
If we didn't set that speed limit, then people are free to drive as fast as we want,

37:45.800 --> 37:47.800
possibly with dangerous consequences,

37:47.800 --> 37:50.800
and people will look to us, the hypothetical government,

37:50.800 --> 37:53.800
for not putting a speed limit on there, when we knew better.

37:53.800 --> 37:57.800
With their behaviour, BetterHelp almost wanted to set a speed limit,

37:57.800 --> 38:00.800
but didn't enforce it, for themselves at least,

38:00.800 --> 38:04.800
and then tried to waive a responsibility in case an accident happened.

38:04.800 --> 38:07.800
On top of this, they failed to market themselves honestly,

38:07.800 --> 38:09.800
and at the centre of this were many content creators.

38:09.800 --> 38:14.800
YouTubers were caught up because of a huge proportion of the dishonesty that came from the marketing.

38:14.800 --> 38:17.800
As said, I doubt that many of them had bad intentions,

38:17.800 --> 38:20.800
but they clearly dived into something much deeper than they had anticipated.

38:20.800 --> 38:23.800
I think there were some questionable responses to criticism from the company,

38:23.800 --> 38:26.800
and from some content creators, that I hope I've addressed comprehensively.

38:26.800 --> 38:31.800
For me going forward, I'm ready to support websites that help people cope with the struggles of life.

38:31.800 --> 38:35.800
However, we should be very thorough when making sure that what we see is what we get,

38:35.800 --> 38:39.800
and that the right structure is in place to hold the right people accountable,

38:39.800 --> 38:42.800
because mental health is volatile, and things will go wrong,

38:42.800 --> 38:46.800
and when they do, we want responsibility. That's what matters.

38:46.800 --> 38:50.800
Better help weren't ready for that, unfortunately.

38:50.800 --> 38:54.800
Hopefully next time, whatever comes forward will be.

38:54.800 --> 38:58.800
So to finish where I started, H3's response to PewDiePie was very strange,

38:58.800 --> 39:00.800
and I don't understand why he made the comments,

39:00.800 --> 39:03.800
as if PewDiePie had even slightly directed the video at him,

39:03.800 --> 39:06.800
because PewDiePie left a specific disclaimer that this wasn't the case,

39:06.800 --> 39:11.800
and I don't think anyone received the impression that Felix was attacking them, let alone them specifically.

39:11.800 --> 39:16.800
The way that he presented my involvement in it, I thought was a little misleading,

39:16.800 --> 39:24.800
and a little out of context, and it made it look like I was way more involved with this company than I was,

39:24.800 --> 39:33.800
or even that it made it look like I used my being depressed to somehow sell better help.

39:33.800 --> 39:36.800
Ethan took it far too personally, and he shouldn't be so fragile,

39:36.800 --> 39:39.800
but a greater narrative may have to be preserved for another time.

39:39.800 --> 39:42.800
I think my time is up with this video. It's gone on long enough.

39:42.800 --> 39:46.800
Anyhow, I want to finish up by thanking my editors.

39:46.800 --> 39:48.800
Once again, I'm going to leave their links in the pinned comment below.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.800
Definitely go and check them out if you have the chance.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.800
Some of them are really great content creators,

39:52.800 --> 39:56.800
and are definitely moving on to greater things in the future, I'm sure of it.

39:56.800 --> 39:59.800
Also, I'd love to hear what you think about this topic below.

39:59.800 --> 40:01.800
I'll be reading some of the comments.

40:01.800 --> 40:06.800
If you want to reach me personally with a comment, then you can hit me up on Twitter,

40:07.800 --> 40:10.800
You can hit me up on Discord, I've got my links in the pinned comment,

40:10.800 --> 40:13.800
and on Facebook, I use that too from time to time.

40:13.800 --> 40:16.800
So, on all platforms, via Instagram, no Instagram yet.

40:16.800 --> 40:20.800
I know, maybe when I become vain enough, I'll download it.

40:20.800 --> 40:23.800
I had good fun making this one, even though it's been quite exhausting.

40:23.800 --> 40:27.800
This was not the easiest video to make, but we got there in the end.

I'd love to hear your thoughts, don't really have anything else to say.

40:30.800 --> 40:31.800
I hope you guys are doing well.

40:31.800 --> 40:34.800
Until then, however, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

40:34.800 --> 40:54.800
Thanks for watching!
