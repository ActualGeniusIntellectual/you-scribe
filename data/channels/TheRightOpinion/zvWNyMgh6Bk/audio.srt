00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,800
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,400
I think we need to discuss this, it's been long enough.

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,800
Yes, because I had exams, those bellends thought they could put me to the test, well, not again.

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,400
Not until the next set of exams, at least.

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,400
God, my life is just one continuous cycle of despair.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,900
Boop boop boop boop boop!

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,600
And on that note, I think it's time we talk about this situation.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,000
But let's start off with a story, because I know how much we love them here, on The Right Opinion.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,200
You see, I released a video on H3.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,200
I worked incredibly hard on the research, that brought it together, the points I made, and I gave it a lot of thought,

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,600
explaining why I believe they strayed away from their original content, and this has subsequently led them to take a break.

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,100
I took a very sympathetic point of view towards them, because of how I felt.

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,200
I think there are a lot of people who've been there.

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,700
However, almost immediately after I released it, I received a few comments pointing out that H3 got themselves

15
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:03,400
in another shitstorm less than 24 hours before, leading my video to be timed fairly inconveniently.

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,700
So what was this shitstorm? Well, let's talk about BetterHelp.

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,700
Even if you're a YouTube casual, you probably will have heard of BetterHelp,

18
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,900
the online interactive website that promotes therapy on an accessible platform, the internet.

19
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,700
So to give you a breakdown, if you're a patient of this site, you sign up, and you fill out a basic form explaining what you're looking for,

20
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,200
and what you may be experiencing, and what they do is that their extensive roster of allegedly qualified therapists

21
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,000
will return to the alleged part in a bit, and they'll hook you up with one of these blokes.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,200
The ultimate aim? Well, generally to improve health, I assume.

23
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,600
But if you've seen the title, you'll know that this is a video also about YouTubers, so where do they fit into this very enticing plot?

24
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,000
Well, BetterHelp targeted a certain brand of YouTubers, in fact, ones that I like to talk about the most,

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,400
the individuals who are seen as the moral bastions of the platform.

26
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,800
This is no coincidence, these individuals have built special relationships with their fans,

27
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,800
and unlike the Jake Pauls of this generation, they deal with more mature subjects.

28
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:04,200
This is the sort of setup that is pretty perfect, and honestly the environment has been set up neatly for something like this to come into play.

29
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,200
Now make no mistake, BetterHelp has existed for a few years, since its inception in 2013,

30
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,800
it was always purring in the background, but recently one of their marketing executives must have spotted an opportunity in the fertile grounds of YouTube,

31
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,800
which is a smart idea in principle. In the last few years, YouTube has become a lot deeper than just a place where people put on facades for the day,

32
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,200
and I've spoken about that in length in the past, it just seems like a progression of the culture.

33
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:35,400
Amongst a lot of these deeper topics that have popped up in the last few years, one that seems increasingly prevalent is that of depression and mental health.

34
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:42,400
There are multiple reasons for this, I think the online world has brought together a new set of people who find themselves away from the turmoil of their real lives,

35
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,600
and in that escape we try to find answers for the problems we face in our own minds, and one of those comes down to mental health.

36
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Depression and so on are complex topics, we need to be able to distinguish between when we may be experiencing mood dips,

37
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,000
and when we actually have an imbalance that disposes us to be depressed.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
A great example of the confusion of the two was Prince EA's video, on how you're not depressed, you just shut up, and that.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,800
Also, it was great to see that Prince EA made the Mental Health Awareness Day on YouTube,

40
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,400
after such an inspirational set of videos, YouTube really know their creators.

41
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,000
YouTubers know that speaking about mental health is extremely sensitive, you can't be seen as taking advantage of the topic,

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,200
but equally we are in a culture where people are being encouraged to be open about their experiences with conditions,

43
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,400
and often being open about these things can help others, and we certainly shouldn't diminish that.

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,200
On the other hand, we shouldn't be seen as clickbaiting it, or taking advantage of the possible experiences of suffering to emotionally manipulate our audiences,

45
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,000
so ironically it becomes a whole different balancing act on working out how to appear genuine, which in a way is contrived within itself.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But that's a topic for a different time, creators who address these topics in their videos will create a bond with their audience,

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,400
sharing an experience, and maybe helping an individual to come to terms with their own struggles,

48
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,400
so it made perfect sense to better help reach out to these lovely creators who are renowned for their reputability,

49
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,400
to promote their therapy website, and help others make it through the same struggles.

50
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,400
But there's a catch, in fact there are a lot of catches.

51
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,800
You see, we over on the YouTube platform are critical bastards, particularly in commentary,

52
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:16,400
and YouTube, although not being exactly quite on the level of attention as much that comes along with celebrity status,

53
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,600
still comes under investigation from commentators and media alike, and BetterHelp should have known this,

54
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,400
because regardless of what is discussed in the next 20, 30, 40 fucking minutes, I don't know how long this is gonna be,

55
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,800
the fact that they've been caught in such a whirlwind of controversy shows they must have done something wrong,

56
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:38,000
and it should be a lesson to them, but we'd be dishing out lessons all day today, like you're attending a college course,

57
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,800
and this motherfucker right here is handing out scholarships, because really this whole thing goes a lot deeper than just BetterHelp.

58
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,000
Today I'm going to be asking what is wrong with BetterHelp, if there's anything wrong with the YouTubers who promote it,

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and if there's anything wrong with their responses, because my exams may be over, but we're just getting started.

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,200
So without further ado, let's dive right in.

61
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Now, people have pretty much gone top to bottom of every single inconsistency within the website and its presentation,

62
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,800
so when I clicked on, I expected to be mostly doing a clean-up job with a lot of the morsels left behind,

63
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:22,800
but I was wrong, and I do have a lot to say, however firstly I'll give you a rundown of the set of controversies they've faced down in the last few weeks.

64
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,800
I definitely recommend checking out PewDiePie's videos, this covers it a lot,

65
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,800
their terms and conditions contained information that was rather sketchy, basically setting out the company as merely a third party,

66
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,800
most notably even though they claim to run background checks on their therapist,

67
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,800
they don't take responsibility if it's revealed that the therapist isn't actually qualified, a very unsettling clause,

68
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,800
mainly for the reason that it might lead to employees being lax on the background checks,

69
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,800
which might end up letting some unqualified and seedy individuals in, such as Dr. Al Dershberger.

70
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:00,800
Now, Big Al here is under indictment for rape charges, I want to emphasise, as always, that an individual is innocent until proven guilty,

71
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:08,800
and people losing their job over any fake accusations is a legitimate concern, however equally when you're having people in positions of mental health counselling,

72
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,800
a significantly more sensitive job, it might be best to not give them a platform until the charges are heard out at least.

73
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:22,800
You could also make the point that an individual's occupation should not necessarily define whether they should be allowed to operate in their position,

74
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,800
this is not an unfair point either, but I feel that given BetterHelp's self acclaimed status as a facilitator,

75
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,800
for them it might be best to err on the side of caution with these issues.

76
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Also, this is only a real source of criticism, because when it was pointed out, they quickly removed his page,

77
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,800
which says to me that it was more about a lack of vetting rather than just a different philosophy.

78
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Equally, there are many people who provide testaments where their therapist didn't appear to be sufficiently qualified in their behaviour,

79
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:54,800
at least towards these individuals, I think this raises one of the first greater philosophical concerns, BetterHelp is a large corporation,

80
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,800
and there is no denying that there are many people who have had positive experiences,

81
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,800
nor am I denying that there are an array of qualified individuals doing a great job,

82
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,800
but there is an incredible shifting of responsibility which makes the website prone to such mishaps.

83
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,800
With any hierarchy, there are people who are expected to be held accountable for the employment of their subordinates,

84
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,800
and in a clinic, this is typically localised to an extent, although chains may have national managers and CEOs,

85
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,800
you'll typically have some sort of branch manager who has that power, BetterHelp seems to have less of a structure when it comes to that,

86
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,800
and although they have dedicated sectors, the lack of involvement seems to have alienated management from these issues,

87
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,800
meaning that they had let their growing criticism slip through the cracks, and this was culminating on the review sites,

88
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,800
although responses were predominantly positive, there was a significant proportion that were negative,

89
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,800
and really there's a lot less room for error when dealing with mental health,

90
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:52,800
and if these people had legitimate complaints, they probably should have been given more attention before BetterHelp decided to launch their platform into the public eye,

91
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,800
however going on their website, the reviews are fairly positive, even with a video review,

92
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,800
while some must have been particularly passionate to submit their experience through the form of a video,

93
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,800
apart from the fact that this guy was actually a paid Fiverr bloke, and I wish I was joking,

94
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:12,800
so the credibility of such testimonials comes under scrutiny, particularly given how generic and banal many of these reviews seem,

95
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,800
and when comparing these testaments to the more mixed experiences documented elsewhere,

96
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,800
this is all part of a greater point however, the marketing, as mentioned some people like BetterHelp,

97
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,800
some people have had positive experiences, in fact it's very likely that a majority of people have had positive experiences,

98
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,800
however the truth is that when your job is merely to provide a platform and some dodgy practitioners are operating

99
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,800
just because they say they're not responsible doesn't mean other people aren't going to hold them responsible,

100
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,800
they should have sorted out these concerns earlier, and instead we're here now,

101
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,800
in response to a lot of the criticism BetterHelp founder Alon Matas posted a response,

102
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,800
which honestly just made themselves look worse in my opinion,

103
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Matas basically set up straw men of people's concerns, talking about certain claims like the ones where the therapists were AIs,

104
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,800
before saying how ridiculous they were, the simple truth is that even though some narratives were undoubtedly exaggerated,

105
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,800
the concerns came from a legitimate place, and that cannot be undermined by pointing out the most far-fetched points of view,

106
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:13,800
it came across as a very salty response, and make no mistake, sometimes YouTube, fandoms, etc can overreact,

107
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,800
I think it's perfectly reasonable to criticise when people go too far, in my Zoella video for example I make that clear,

108
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,800
but equally the context of Matas being the founder of BetterHelp and the apparent presentation that this is him defending himself against the allegations

109
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:32,800
means that people will not perceive this response well, and although I think discussing whether people are overreacting is a legitimate discourse that needs to be had,

110
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,800
it just doesn't feel like he presented it as that, on top of this he was so aggressive and braggadocious in the response,

111
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:45,800
that it came across as extremely narcissistic, he brags about how this controversy has brought so many new sign-ups, like why?

112
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,800
It didn't leave me with a feeling of confidence in him, everyone knows that BetterHelp has a lot of clients and many of them are happy,

113
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,800
I'm not saying these aren't achievements to be proud of, but they're not relevant to the discussion,

114
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,800
even the more ludicrous claims, it just feels like you're appealing to a greater morality to deflect the allegations,

115
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,800
if we want to discuss the cultural impact of BetterHelp then we will, but the specific problems aren't alleviated by that,

116
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,800
in the words of famous philosopher Brian Quang Le, it's irrelevant.

117
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:20,800
Another very interesting fact was how Alan viewed BetterHelp himself, in one paragraph he takes the time to actually respond to one of the legitimate criticisms,

118
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,800
and does admit that he made a mistake of including what are called the get out of jail free clause,

119
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,800
and referred to it as standard legalese, which I think is one of the biggest problems with BetterHelp,

120
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,800
they seem to lapse into these moments where they view themselves as a corporation like any other,

121
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,800
and mental health isn't like any other, mental health should not have a market value,

122
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:46,800
it's not a commodity to be bought and sold, and therefore having quote standard legalese that absolves your responsibility isn't really on,

123
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,800
and does create legitimate concerns, however he admitted it was wrong so I won't give him too much stigma,

124
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:58,800
but it's definitely something worth thinking about going forward, you are not just any old company who can simply throw down a copy and pasted terms and conditions,

125
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,800
also we all make spelling mistakes, but once again, maybe just spell check a bit, just a thought,

126
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,800
now we could finish here and get onto the YouTubers, but we're not finished, oh how I wish we were,

127
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,800
because I said I'd give this an original spin, and this is where we come back to the marketing point.

128
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Now I have been doing psychology as a subject for a good few years alongside my politics, philosophy and international law,

129
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:34,800
and part of what they teach is research methods, which is analysing and replicating the techniques used in psychological studies,

130
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:43,800
so I became particularly intrigued when I noticed on their front page they boasted a 98% rate of individuals involved in their programs making significant progress,

131
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:49,800
despite the fact that only 70% experienced an alleged reduction in depression, which is a rather sizeable margin,

132
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:56,800
considering I'd assume a reduction in symptoms is correlated with the idea of progress, but still 70% is significant,

133
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:03,800
and hey, they were conducted by the Berkeley Wellbeing Institute, sounds like a very reputable place, am I right or am I right,

134
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:10,800
I mean how could I be wrong, I'm the right opinion, so I decided to take my expertise and investigate this study a bit more closely,

135
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,800
after all these are some pretty noteworthy bragging rights, and there were two studies, two, not just one,

136
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,800
so let's have a look at them and break them down and see if we can find any little mistakes.

137
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:27,800
Now what may stand out to some people straight out the gate is the gynocentrism, which is known as the predominance of women in the study,

138
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:36,800
and although definitely having 78 and 80% females can skew results, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that the pool of subjects was just restricted,

139
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:46,800
a point that we'll address very soon, no. What immediately struck me was how they restricted the participants in the results to individuals who have been clients of BetterHelp for 3 months and 2 weeks at least,

140
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:54,800
which will immediately skew results as it's a significant amount of time, and a high majority of people who are dissatisfied with the treatment they're receiving will have dropped out before then.

141
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,800
Participant dropout is a considerable problem with any study, however with an overwhelming majority of research,

142
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,800
normally a study will explain how these sample of individuals were taken, for example if they put out an ad in a newspaper,

143
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:11,800
there is no clarification in this study, so I cannot possibly comment on the validity of the assemblence of such individuals,

144
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,800
if these people were already intent on signing up to BetterHelp then you're skewing the study group's decisions.

145
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Now that may not be the case, but there is no comment on such, so how can I compare?

146
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,800
And although they do comment on the participant dropout, they do not clarify how many participants dropped out, which is extremely suspicious,

147
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:33,800
if they ran this study from day one like they claimed, they should have clear statistics on the number of people who exited the study.

148
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,800
As they took questionnaires at the start, this should have been easy, and they need to include this,

149
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,800
because to provide an example, if 90% of participants dropped out citing ineffectiveness of the therapy,

150
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,800
then the 70% of the 10% left who experienced decreased depression symptoms, it wouldn't mean jack shit.

151
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,800
I highly doubt it's anything like 90% dropout for your information, but they have to include that statistic,

152
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,800
otherwise I find the contents of this study completely invalid, and I quote,

153
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:05,800
This approach may have led to a bias, including people in the study who favoured BetterHelp e-counselling, wow, just maybe.

154
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,800
I think these researchers might be onto something here, lads.

155
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,800
On top of this, the study failed to use any control group to make the comparison of BetterHelp's therapy with regards to face-to-face,

156
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,800
and although not necessarily a requirement with regards to the variables being used,

157
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:26,800
given how one of their claims is the preference over face-to-face therapy, it bemuses me why they wouldn't take advantage of their most scientific opportunity to prove it.

158
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:34,800
But as noted on their page, they do note that their clients have a specific predilection towards their content over face-to-face,

159
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,800
so how did they source such information? As said, it was backed up by research.

160
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
Well, let's talk about the second study.

161
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,800
This study is much worse than the first one, because there is no pretreatment questionnaire,

162
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,800
you could only respond to this questionnaire if you had already taken treatment for three months,

163
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,800
which is unbelievably terrible methodology, like I cannot begin to explain how awful that is.

164
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:01,800
I've already explained how this is a flawed approach on the first study, but at least they took the evaluations before the treatment, like come on guys.

165
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:09,800
Anyhow, one of the other possible components of the other study was that they had 318 participants, not the most, but a decent amount.

166
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:17,800
This study had the grand total of 48 participants for one set of questions, and 38 for the comparison of face-to-face therapy.

167
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:26,800
So you know that 98% statistic that's on the front page? That was literally 47 people, and the one person who said otherwise was the 2%.

168
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,800
This is some excellent data collection, lads. Excellent data collection.

169
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:37,800
And as said, they had the perfect opportunity to conduct comparative research between the effects of face-to-face therapy and online therapy.

170
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Why did they decide to undertake such unreliable methods to provide validity to their claims when there were better options?

171
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,800
Equally, in his written defence, matters boast that they've helped hundreds of thousands of people,

172
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:57,800
and yet a study proving its success that is promoted on the front page could only gather 48 people. Only 48.

173
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,800
I wish I was finished criticising this study, but I'm not.

174
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Throughout the study, it is infested with this annoyingly complementary tone towards better help.

175
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:13,800
For these reasons, the present research enables us to begin clarifying the unique benefits of a high-quality and modality-integrated e-cancelling platform.

176
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:19,800
This is at the start of the study. If a study sets out to prove how good something is, chances are it's a tad biased.

177
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,800
There are many more examples of such high praise that I'll chuck on the screen now, I don't need to read them out.

178
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,800
On top of this, the study fails to distinguish between e-therapy and better help therapy,

179
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:36,800
as if better help has trademarked e-therapy, and it completely ignores the premise that there are already plenty of other online therapy sites,

180
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,800
and therefore just turns into an extended ad for better help, and just equivocates better help to online therapy in general.

181
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:49,800
To summarise, I'm not a fan of the study. It also doesn't help that the individual central to the Berkeley Institute well-being,

182
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:56,800
Cheeky S. Davis, has a testimonial page, and on that testimonial page is a better help community and support manager,

183
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:03,800
Noor Baker, who sings high praises for Davis, saying that she has been a vital part of better help's research efforts,

184
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,800
so it appears that these people are quite closely associated, a highly personal team player, I'm sure.

185
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,800
All this data is completely manipulated.

186
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,800
Now in response to this information, Mr. Matters here may say, well, it's just a corporate thing, and that's true to an extent.

187
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:27,800
I highly doubt that those L'Oreal adverts that show that 80% of women have skin that feels smoother after application are studies done under scientific conditions,

188
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,800
but that's what annoys me. Better help seems to want to present themselves as better than your average company,

189
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,800
but equally with that comes a level of trust. That means they can't just behave like any other corporation,

190
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,800
they shouldn't be going around manipulating data, and they will be held to higher standards.

191
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:49,800
Psychological studies are extremely important to the scientific community, particularly in working out which methods of therapy work best for the public.

192
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:57,800
BetterHelp or Davis have taken advantage of this structure and made a study that looks appealing from the outside but does not warrant front-page claims,

193
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,800
and having something like 98% made significant progress is inherently misleading.

194
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:09,800
And this comes back to what's annoyed a lot of people, whether it's the very suspicious reviews, the failure to want to take responsibility,

195
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:16,800
or this little debacle that I've just unpacked. It's the contradiction, on one hand they proudly proclaim the positive results they've received

196
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:23,800
and represent themselves as this highly reputable site with scientific backing, on the other hand their conduct is very corporate and manipulative,

197
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:31,800
which would be normal in a way for a business if it weren't dealing with people's mental health, and this is the epitome of corporate tactics.

198
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:38,800
It's not what people want for such a website, you can't be the good guys while acting like that, you can't have your cake and eat it.

199
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,800
But you know who can? YouTubers. Well, let's get a slice.

200
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:52,800
With all this research, it may come as a surprise that BetterHelp has been promoted for a while by YouTubers all over the platform,

201
00:18:52,800 --> 00:19:00,800
many of them are people with strong moral grounding, DeFranco, Boogie, Jaxfilms, Shane Dawson, H3, some of whom we'll touch on later.

202
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:07,800
Firstly, I want to talk about why on earth YouTubers would be so keen to jump on something so precarious, I mean we're dealing with mental health here.

203
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:15,800
As PewDiePie said, anything like that is a rickety bridge, particularly when you're dealing with sponsors, some audiences won't want you even putting ads on a video about mental health,

204
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:21,800
and although I'd say I'm arguably slightly more easy going than that, I can still see why it is a cause for concern.

205
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,800
We have come a long way as content creators to move towards this more open era of discussion,

206
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:32,800
however I think it's really important to emphasise that these individuals are only projecting their own personal experiences,

207
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:39,800
and though these experiences may help you come to terms with your own personal conditions, the best course of action is to then seek confirmation through an expert.

208
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:46,800
Now I do not deny that BetterHelp is a relatively professional site, however even they agree that they cannot provide formal diagnoses,

209
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,800
but I'm sure there are a few therapists who haven't got that message given how discreetly it's been delivered.

210
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,800
Point is, when you have a video talking about mental health and then say, and this is sponsored by BetterHelp,

211
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:03,800
it does not serve as a fully endorsed supplement to the problems that you may be working on to discover, even they won't endorse themselves.

212
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:09,800
Once again, it could well be a get out of jail free clause, but I don't think that makes it any more setful in those instances.

213
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:18,800
On the other hand, I don't want to completely trash the concept of online therapy, as it can provide important support for those who have fears of even going outside,

214
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,800
some people who may not have the privilege of affording face to face, that shit ain't cheap.

215
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:28,800
And so when thinking about this, when the fact that BetterHelp emphasized these elements to many of the YouTubers who promoted it,

216
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,800
many of them who've probably been in the same positions, I can understand why some of them seem very keen.

217
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:39,800
I spoke to Boogie about this in a conversation, and one of the things that he said he did was try the site out for himself,

218
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:45,800
and this is something that a lot of creators emphasized, and their experience with such individuals on the site was pretty great.

219
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,800
So suddenly, what happened with BetterHelp was the shoe that fit Cinderella's foot for many of these YouTubers.

220
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Many of us are cooped up inside a lot, many of us do suffer from mental health issues, you have to be kind of insane to do YouTube,

221
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:04,800
it's a draining occupation, because although in some ways it is easier, the networking and the business makes it a ruthless job to go anywhere,

222
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,800
you really have to be willing to put in the extra shift, because there's always someone out there willing to go that one step further than you,

223
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:17,800
and that environment won't just shape people, but it'll also attract people of that certain persuasion, and so the market for this was huge.

224
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:23,800
This is likely why many YouTubers did rush to promote it, after all, they had their positive experiences,

225
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:29,800
they saw the general feedback, and it all looks pretty affirmative, and many of these creators have done brand deals before,

226
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,800
on top of this, you know, promoting something like this, it makes you look good.

227
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,800
There's no doubt about that, whether it was their intention or not, promoting mental health stuff is good,

228
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,800
you know, you might help people, and you'll come out with a better image.

229
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Many of these creators have done brand deals before, many of them are used to promoting content,

230
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:52,800
and let's be honest, who reads the terms and conditions? Why should the content creators make an exception this time round?

231
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Well, because it's an exceptional situation, and it comes back to mental health.

232
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:02,800
I'm going to try and avoid repeating myself too much here, but YouTubers can't go around and treat these sites like any other gig,

233
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,800
it was unbelievably naive to think that was a good idea to do so.

234
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,800
Now, I'm legitimately not against people being sponsored by such sites,

235
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,800
however, it's even more important to be sensitive when you're actually going to be profiting off it.

236
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,800
Once again, it's a sponsorship, I wouldn't expect anything else to an extent,

237
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,800
but at the same time, a high majority of these people receive money per sign-up,

238
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,800
and therefore, it was important that there were things being explained clearly,

239
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,800
because you influence how many people sign up.

240
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
Now, I will hold better help to account to an extent,

241
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,800
as I believe they did fail to notify many YouTubers of the little clauses they had inserted,

242
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,800
particularly one saying it's not an ample substitute,

243
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,800
but responsibility should also fall on the shoulders of content creators for not being more ready to research it.

244
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,800
Another problem that was definitely the cause of it spreading so quickly,

245
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,800
was the fact that people just saw other YouTubers promoting it and likely judged the brand on the basis of that.

246
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,800
As said, better help went after a lot of moral staples in the community,

247
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,800
and once they were promoting it, I'm sure many other content creators saw it,

248
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,800
and it caused a subsequent domino effect of unfounded trust in it.

249
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,800
Building on this trust point, better help was also partly partnered with Philip DeFranco's business Rogue Rocket,

250
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,800
and for some YouTubers being reached by a trusted member of the community probably instilled a sense of faith,

251
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,800
even though, as mentioned in other videos, that was all it essentially did.

252
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,800
Given the business model of taking a cut at the sign-up,

253
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,800
better help could have as many YouTubers promoted as possible without losing any money.

254
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,800
It's natural for companies to want more sign-ups, more money, and so on.

255
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with that,

256
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,800
equally the YouTubers being used to promote this were definitely using their trust over their viewers,

257
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,800
which is likely why the backlash has been so strong,

258
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,800
because you're putting forward a case for a website that deals with mental health,

259
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,800
and you're subsequently profiting off them, it has to be watertight, and it wasn't.

260
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,800
I watched a lot of these promotions for these sites,

261
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,800
and generally I didn't think many of the creators were acting in bad faith,

262
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,800
I think they just didn't know better.

263
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,800
Going forward, I don't think they have to plow through the terms and conditions for all their future products,

264
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,800
though it's not a bad idea, but I definitely recommend being a bit more meticulous,

265
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,800
at least for certain products, and making sure that what you're promoting

266
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,800
is something that a person will be able to make a clear conscious decision to go into,

267
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,800
particularly if everything is not as clear as it seems.

268
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:17,800
The problem is that sponsors typically place a shared responsibility on the creator and the user,

269
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,800
the creator to deliver a truthful perception of the service,

270
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,800
and the user to make that conscious decision to involve themselves with the product.

271
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,800
The problem with mental health promotion is that you're dealing with people who could be vulnerable,

272
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
and thus may have diminished responsibility,

273
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:34,800
therefore shifting even more responsibility to deliver an honest presentation onto the creator,

274
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:39,800
and unfortunately because they misused that responsibility, people felt more animosity towards them.

275
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Now this immediately means that regardless of how earnest the intentions of these creators were,

276
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,800
they were going to be staring down a significant amount of criticism

277
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,800
because of the shortfalls of the site and the marketing.

278
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,800
At the end of the day, they were equally a part of the marketing as the Botch study and the Forge reviews,

279
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,800
and although they were likely misled, they're still autonomous beings,

280
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
and they still have a level of responsibility,

281
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,800
and as always on my channel, this makes the responses to such criticism

282
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,800
just as important as the criticism itself, which is where we'll go now.

283
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,800
One of the creators who was sponsored by BetterHelp was the YouTuber Domics.

284
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,800
Now he's an animator, and as noted in previous videos,

285
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,800
we already know that they have quite a tight relationship with their audience,

286
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,800
and that manifests a lot of trust.

287
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,800
Also, given the audience of such creators, it probably means that this could appeal to such a demographic.

288
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,800
Following the BetterHelp incident, he put out this set of tweets.

289
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,800
In my opinion, this was the best way to respond.

290
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,800
He acknowledges the flaws, acknowledges the mistakes that he made on his part,

291
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,800
and relinquishes the gains that he made of it due to his lack of awareness,

292
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,800
and this is an important point.

293
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,800
At the end of the day, whether BetterHelp is being misframed or not.

294
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,800
Even if it was a great site, the lack of further research is something that would be a flaw

295
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,800
regardless of the site's performance.

296
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,800
If people were more familiar with the site, they could have either spoken to the site prior,

297
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,800
and perhaps had some changes, or they might not have proceeded with such a sponsorship.

298
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,800
On the other hand, they may have been in a better position to defend it.

299
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,800
At this point, it's reasonable to hold up your hands and say,

300
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,800
I was ignorant to these things. I don't think that's a crime.

301
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,800
But it is a mistake given the context of the sponsorship.

302
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,800
You have to vet a bit more tightly, which is why this is probably the best way to respond,

303
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,800
because regardless of the context, it's a mistake that many of them were guilty of.

304
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,800
Another thing that a lot of creators said was that they did actually sign up and try it,

305
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,800
and many of them had positive experiences,

306
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,800
and then wrongly assumed that their experience spoke louder than any individual problems.

307
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,800
These are all mistakes that any associated creator can accept.

308
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,800
I can accept them. Most YouTubers took that route.

309
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Many bluntly stated that they were ending any relationship with better help.

310
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,800
Another fairly safe response. You don't want your words to be twisted.

311
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,800
However, there was another way to respond, which is where we're going now.

312
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,800
The sort of responses that we've just spoken about is when a person facing down these allegations

313
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,800
can accept they've made a mistake, and be apologetic.

314
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,800
The positives are that it often means that people are forgiving of us,

315
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,800
and it means that hopefully we can move on.

316
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:11,800
However, it can also be a negative, as if we feel that what's been committed isn't that bad.

317
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,800
By apologizing, we push the standards up for what we view as wrong.

318
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,800
Equally, if we apologize for too much, we seem weak, and too intent to please others,

319
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,800
and then it creates the question of how we keep making these mistakes again, and again, and again.

320
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Apologies cannot be overused, or else they become disingenuous,

321
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,800
and the whole notion of an apology implies that we want to do better.

322
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,800
So apologizing continuously diminishes the meaning of each apology,

323
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,800
and will make people more critical every time you try to do it.

324
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,800
For that reason, this leads us to the other side of the spectrum,

325
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,800
where there are some people who remain completely steadfast on what they've done,

326
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,800
and are never prepared to admit that they've made mistakes.

327
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,800
Now, I have to admit, I think even as the most informed person,

328
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,800
it would be hard to defend a position in this situation without taking a hit.

329
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,800
But there are people who do this in these sorts of situations,

330
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,800
mainly because they shoehorn themselves into such circumstances.

331
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,800
I understand the logic, sometimes by coming out against allegations in an aggressive manner,

332
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,800
you can shut them down, but equally, if these allegations have more grounding than you anticipate them to be,

333
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,800
you can come across as unnecessarily defensive and insecure,

334
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,800
leading to increased suspicion on your involvement with such a predicament,

335
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,800
which is where we lead to Philip DeFranco.

336
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,800
Now, I made a sympathetic video in the past on DeFranco.

337
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,800
At the time, it was my best performing video, and it was a great achievement,

338
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,800
brought me lots of new fans, many of whom I assume are mutual fans of DeFranco.

339
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,800
Hey there, if you're one of them and you're still watching, I appreciate your service.

340
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,800
I stand by what I said in that video, these points do not change,

341
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,800
but his response was definitely taking a page out of Alan Mattis' book,

342
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,800
which isn't necessarily a good way to respond.

343
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,800
Initially, this response was well received, but once commentators made responses,

344
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,800
and even Colossal published one to the Bated channel, a lot of cracks began to show.

345
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,800
Once again, as a response to many of the points that DeFranco set up,

346
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,800
they weren't unreasonable responses,

347
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,800
but the problem is that it was premised as a response to the whole better help situation.

348
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,800
But Philly D was very carefully picking out points that he was responding to,

349
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,800
and once again, if you want to defend yourself against some of the more ridiculous allegations,

350
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,800
it's not a bad position, but there is less acknowledgement of wrongdoing

351
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
than in Alan's hackneyed response.

352
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,800
I think this is aggravated by the fact that Philip said this.

353
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,800
And also to everyone in general, I apologize if I end up repeating things,

354
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,800
I know I talked about this last Thursday, but I think just in one dedicated setting,

355
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,800
it's important that I hit on all the notes,

356
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,800
since for some reason, depending on who is talking about this story,

357
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,800
certain parts are excluded, or glossed over, or exaggerated, or misconstrued.

358
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,800
And this is probably true to an extent,

359
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,800
but it's very clear that Philip's portrayal isn't comprehensive either.

360
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,800
BetterHelp has been a sponsor of our videos,

361
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,800
we've even partnered with them at a company level

362
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,800
to help them with other sponsorships with other YouTubers,

363
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,800
and so that clip has been misconstrued as,

364
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,800
oh, that's the smoking gun, that is the evidence that Philip DeFranco,

365
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,800
he is invested, he is part of the, he is the mastermind.

366
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,800
Well, I wouldn't use the term smoking gun,

367
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,800
but it could be, in the sense you didn't reveal you were partnered with BetterHelp

368
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,800
before you sponsored with them.

369
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,800
You've now clarified that your first sponsorship with them was made

370
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,800
before you partnered with them, which is fine,

371
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,800
but what about all the others you did after that?

372
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,800
There's a lack of transparency here, which should be an obvious concern to anyone,

373
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,800
because you're promoting something that you've got an invested interest in.

374
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,800
And it's one that goes beyond your standard sponsorship, I think.

375
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,800
That doesn't have to mean you've literally invested in BetterHelp yourself,

376
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,800
but not disclosing your partnership makes all your sponsorships,

377
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,800
other than the first one now, a clear conflict of interest.

378
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,800
Sit down and ask yourself if you benefit from BetterHelp's success

379
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,800
even without a DeFranco sponsorship, and the answer will be yes.

380
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,800
And once this was observed by other creators,

381
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
he quickly fell victim to the consequences.

382
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,800
Responding to criticism is a balancing act,

383
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,800
knowing when to apologise, and knowing when to rebut.

384
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,800
And DeFranco clearly has a faith in BetterHelp,

385
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,800
maybe a product of his investment,

386
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,800
but the problem is that people have already taken that point of view into account,

387
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,800
and therefore DeFranco's presentation for these critics

388
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,800
have this delusion about BetterHelp that needs to be corrected

389
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,800
before we can even have a discussion,

390
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,800
a discussion that DeFranco doesn't even get to in the video,

391
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,800
is inherently condescending.

392
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,800
It's clear that DeFranco wanted to keep BetterHelp in positive standing with the video,

393
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,800
and defend its position, and really, he may have been the person to do that,

394
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,800
but I think it was a lose-lose predicament,

395
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,800
that if he had addressed the worst arguments,

396
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,800
people would call him out for not addressing the best ones,

397
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,800
and if he addressed the best ones, he'd probably have a hard time,

398
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
because you can't counter them,

399
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,800
particularly when BetterHelp had already pulled pages and information

400
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,800
that had been criticised,

401
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,800
meaning that they had already implicitly admitted they'd made such mistakes.

402
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,800
So the only argument that you can make is that BetterHelp,

403
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,800
as a greater product, hasn't been that tainted,

404
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,800
and that argument just wouldn't wash with viewers in the current state.

405
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,800
So DeFranco arguably did the best he could with the quote,

406
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,800
defensive argument, but it wasn't enough,

407
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,800
and in my opinion, he should have accepted there were mistakes,

408
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,800
and just admitted it.

409
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,800
I don't think there was any way out of it.

410
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,800
One of the aspects DeFranco mentioned in his video

411
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,800
was that he would be taking a trip to the headquarters of BetterHelp

412
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,800
to ascertain their mode of operation.

413
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,800
To me, it seemed like a fairly harmless venture,

414
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,800
but one that wouldn't really change anything.

415
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,800
Following this, he uploaded this post explaining his position on it,

416
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,800
and honestly, I read the first paragraph,

417
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,800
and it seemed like he was making a lot of sense.

418
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
But then he says this,

419
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,800
With that all said, we'll be fully ending our relationship with BetterHelp.

420
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,800
This is not based on anything that came from the meeting,

421
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,800
but from a place of understanding that part of the community

422
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,800
just does not feel it as appropriate to have a sponsorship with a company

423
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,800
in the mental health space.

424
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,800
And this annoyed me. It did.

425
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,800
And I'm a fairly placid person, so it must mean something.

426
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
I want to say something about it.

427
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,800
It's not that people weren't ready for a sponsorship with mental health.

428
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,800
There are many of us who accept that under the premise,

429
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
this could be a good idea.

430
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,800
This could be something that works and changes lives.

431
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,800
And for a while, many people promoted BetterHelp without repercussions.

432
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,800
Sure, there were some people who were protesting it,

433
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,800
but they're not people who caused this.

434
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,800
No, what caused this was the shifting tide in public sentiment

435
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,800
about the credibility of the website, based on significant problems

436
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,800
which they themselves clearly submitted to.

437
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,800
Yes, people probably had bad experiences with therapists,

438
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,800
and obviously, in light of scandals, these complaints came to the forefront of the discourse.

439
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,800
But at the same time, this was equally a deeper problem with marketing and philosophy.

440
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,800
Shifting responsibility onto the community,

441
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,800
as if they're not happy with any mental health websites at all,

442
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,800
just seems like a kick in the teeth.

443
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,800
Barely a few lines after you admitted that they had problems,

444
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,800
whether you consider them derisory or not.

445
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,800
YouTubers have this real problem of understanding sometimes.

446
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,800
Besides the stories that have come to light of recent,

447
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
it's what an environment like that can breed.

448
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:51,800
It's the potential, when people see companies shifting responsibility with such clauses,

449
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,800
when people see companies manipulating their market,

450
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,800
whether the service is good right now is besides the point,

451
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,800
because when you have a company that's willing to behave like that,

452
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,800
people lose trust because of what might happen in the future,

453
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,800
and what they might let happen.

454
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,800
In my opinion, you should be empathetic to that.

455
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,800
People were right to criticize it because it gave them too much leverage

456
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
for exploitation to occur within that site,

457
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,800
and for you to then say that you'd heard the stories that people had told you,

458
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,800
and you presented them to them at the BetterHelp headquarters,

459
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,800
and then going back to conclude that there was a community

460
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
who just wasn't cool with mental health is audacious,

461
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,800
as if we were the ones responsible.

462
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,800
We don't have to change. We should be critical.

463
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,800
We should drive home these principles of companies being honest,

464
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,800
whether it's in the advertising or in the fine print,

465
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,800
particularly when dealing with the issue of mental health.

466
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,800
It's not dollar-shave club sponsorship where the results are fairly consistent,

467
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,800
and you'll get a nice clean-shaven chinny-chin-chin.

468
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,800
There is an immense amount of trust being levied here.

469
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,800
It is the company that needs to change, not us.

470
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,800
Whether it was the fake testimonials, the get-out-of-jail-free clauses,

471
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,800
or the pseudo-scientific study that was being used to try and elevate their results,

472
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,800
they were the ones who weren't ready, not us.

473
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,800
I spoke to a lot of community members, a lot of content creators,

474
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,800
and the sentiment was that they wanted to promote and support this,

475
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,800
but they found themselves ultimately in a corner where the company they wanted to support

476
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,800
hadn't presented themselves honestly.

477
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,800
And as marketers and beneficiaries, they became implicated in this.

478
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,800
When people sign up to BetterHelp, it was presented like it was a substitute,

479
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,800
so it became an assumption to the viewer.

480
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,800
The only thing that was constantly mentioned in the BetterHelp adverts

481
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,800
were that it wasn't an emergency hotline.

482
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,800
Other than that, no details were given.

483
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,800
It is also assumed that the people who hired the therapists, BetterHelp themselves,

484
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,800
would take some level of responsibility.

485
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,800
It is instinctively assumed that the reviews were honest,

486
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,800
the research is honest, with content creators using that trust.

487
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,800
Promoting this, they became the source of the statement

488
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
because they had promoted these assumptions,

489
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,800
that although I believe they assumed too, they should have known better,

490
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,800
because the trust that their audience has in them reinforces those assumptions.

491
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
One of the things about mental health is its uniqueness.

492
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
No two people have the same mentality.

493
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,800
It's all one huge mess, and we on YouTube, we're all messes.

494
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
Nothing is new about that.

495
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,800
But we need to be clear in what's being offered and who it's being offered to.

496
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,800
Signing up to BetterHelp and having a good experience

497
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,800
isn't evidence that every experience is going to be good.

498
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,800
YouTubers share a lot of mental health experiences and I think it's important,

499
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,800
and often the overarching narratives of their stories

500
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
can touch on a general struggle that is felt by many.

501
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,800
But equally, they shouldn't equate this to everyone's struggle,

502
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,800
and in this instance, they need to look at the roots of what they were supporting

503
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,800
rather than just the singular experience that they had and working outwards.

504
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,800
They need to go bottom up rather than top down.

505
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,800
To understand mental health is different to just experiencing the complications facing it,

506
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
and it's a tricky, tight-rope to tread.

507
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,800
I think that going forward, everyone has a responsibility to know what they're promoting

508
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,800
will be right for their audience when it comes to sensitive topics,

509
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,800
because I do believe in some perks of online therapy.

510
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,800
It won't be for everyone, but for those people, it may be an important first step.

511
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,800
For people who have problems leaving the house and such, these are real changes that can be made.

512
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,800
I don't want this video to be just a bashing of the premise of online therapy.

513
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,800
No, I'm just bashing this execution.

514
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,800
It's a message to those who should do better.

515
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,800
When you can do better, why wouldn't you?

516
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,800
I want to close this video by providing you with a little allegory

517
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,800
from my current philosophy professor, who was actually a really interesting bloke.

518
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,800
Big props to him for being one of the first tutors to make philosophy interesting.

519
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,800
And he said that when dealing with much of the moral philosophy that we were covering,

520
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,800
that moral arguments are like a speed limit we set.

521
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,800
We can't expect that everyone will drive within that speed limit.

522
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,800
Many people will behave outside of what is considered acceptable from time to time.

523
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,800
By setting the speed limit, we move that responsibility onto the driver,

524
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,800
and they become accountable for their actions.

525
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,800
If we didn't set that speed limit, then people are free to drive as fast as we want,

526
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,800
possibly with dangerous consequences,

527
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,800
and people will look to us, the hypothetical government,

528
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,800
for not putting a speed limit on there, when we knew better.

529
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,800
With their behaviour, BetterHelp almost wanted to set a speed limit,

530
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,800
but didn't enforce it, for themselves at least,

531
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,800
and then tried to waive a responsibility in case an accident happened.

532
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,800
On top of this, they failed to market themselves honestly,

533
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,800
and at the centre of this were many content creators.

534
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:14,800
YouTubers were caught up because of a huge proportion of the dishonesty that came from the marketing.

535
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,800
As said, I doubt that many of them had bad intentions,

536
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,800
but they clearly dived into something much deeper than they had anticipated.

537
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,800
I think there were some questionable responses to criticism from the company,

538
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,800
and from some content creators, that I hope I've addressed comprehensively.

539
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,800
For me going forward, I'm ready to support websites that help people cope with the struggles of life.

540
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,800
However, we should be very thorough when making sure that what we see is what we get,

541
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,800
and that the right structure is in place to hold the right people accountable,

542
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,800
because mental health is volatile, and things will go wrong,

543
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,800
and when they do, we want responsibility. That's what matters.

544
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,800
Better help weren't ready for that, unfortunately.

545
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,800
Hopefully next time, whatever comes forward will be.

546
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,800
So to finish where I started, H3's response to PewDiePie was very strange,

547
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,800
and I don't understand why he made the comments,

548
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,800
as if PewDiePie had even slightly directed the video at him,

549
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,800
because PewDiePie left a specific disclaimer that this wasn't the case,

550
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,800
and I don't think anyone received the impression that Felix was attacking them, let alone them specifically.

551
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:16,800
The way that he presented my involvement in it, I thought was a little misleading,

552
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:24,800
and a little out of context, and it made it look like I was way more involved with this company than I was,

553
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:33,800
or even that it made it look like I used my being depressed to somehow sell better help.

554
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,800
Ethan took it far too personally, and he shouldn't be so fragile,

555
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,800
but a greater narrative may have to be preserved for another time.

556
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,800
I think my time is up with this video. It's gone on long enough.

557
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,800
Anyhow, I want to finish up by thanking my editors.

558
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,800
Once again, I'm going to leave their links in the pinned comment below.

559
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,800
Definitely go and check them out if you have the chance.

560
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,800
Some of them are really great content creators,

561
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,800
and are definitely moving on to greater things in the future, I'm sure of it.

562
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,800
Also, I'd love to hear what you think about this topic below.

563
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,800
I'll be reading some of the comments.

564
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:06,800
If you want to reach me personally with a comment, then you can hit me up on Twitter,

565
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,800
You can hit me up on Discord, I've got my links in the pinned comment,

566
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,800
and on Facebook, I use that too from time to time.

567
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,800
So, on all platforms, via Instagram, no Instagram yet.

568
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,800
I know, maybe when I become vain enough, I'll download it.

569
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,800
I had good fun making this one, even though it's been quite exhausting.

570
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,800
This was not the easiest video to make, but we got there in the end.

571
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,800
I'd love to hear your thoughts, don't really have anything else to say.

572
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,800
I hope you guys are doing well.

573
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,800
Until then, however, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

574
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:54,800
Thanks for watching!
