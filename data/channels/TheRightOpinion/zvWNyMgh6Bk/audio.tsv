0	10800	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
10800	13400	I think we need to discuss this, it's been long enough.
13400	18800	Yes, because I had exams, those bellends thought they could put me to the test, well, not again.
18800	21400	Not until the next set of exams, at least.
21400	24400	God, my life is just one continuous cycle of despair.
24400	25900	Boop boop boop boop boop!
25900	28600	And on that note, I think it's time we talk about this situation.
28600	33000	But let's start off with a story, because I know how much we love them here, on The Right Opinion.
33000	35200	You see, I released a video on H3.
35200	41200	I worked incredibly hard on the research, that brought it together, the points I made, and I gave it a lot of thought,
41200	46600	explaining why I believe they strayed away from their original content, and this has subsequently led them to take a break.
46600	50100	I took a very sympathetic point of view towards them, because of how I felt.
50100	52200	I think there are a lot of people who've been there.
52200	57700	However, almost immediately after I released it, I received a few comments pointing out that H3 got themselves
57700	63400	in another shitstorm less than 24 hours before, leading my video to be timed fairly inconveniently.
63400	66700	So what was this shitstorm? Well, let's talk about BetterHelp.
66700	70700	Even if you're a YouTube casual, you probably will have heard of BetterHelp,
70700	75900	the online interactive website that promotes therapy on an accessible platform, the internet.
75900	81700	So to give you a breakdown, if you're a patient of this site, you sign up, and you fill out a basic form explaining what you're looking for,
81700	87200	and what you may be experiencing, and what they do is that their extensive roster of allegedly qualified therapists
87200	91000	will return to the alleged part in a bit, and they'll hook you up with one of these blokes.
91000	94200	The ultimate aim? Well, generally to improve health, I assume.
94200	100600	But if you've seen the title, you'll know that this is a video also about YouTubers, so where do they fit into this very enticing plot?
100600	106000	Well, BetterHelp targeted a certain brand of YouTubers, in fact, ones that I like to talk about the most,
106000	109400	the individuals who are seen as the moral bastions of the platform.
109400	113800	This is no coincidence, these individuals have built special relationships with their fans,
113800	117800	and unlike the Jake Pauls of this generation, they deal with more mature subjects.
117800	124200	This is the sort of setup that is pretty perfect, and honestly the environment has been set up neatly for something like this to come into play.
124200	129200	Now make no mistake, BetterHelp has existed for a few years, since its inception in 2013,
129200	136800	it was always purring in the background, but recently one of their marketing executives must have spotted an opportunity in the fertile grounds of YouTube,
136800	143800	which is a smart idea in principle. In the last few years, YouTube has become a lot deeper than just a place where people put on facades for the day,
143800	148200	and I've spoken about that in length in the past, it just seems like a progression of the culture.
148200	155400	Amongst a lot of these deeper topics that have popped up in the last few years, one that seems increasingly prevalent is that of depression and mental health.
155400	162400	There are multiple reasons for this, I think the online world has brought together a new set of people who find themselves away from the turmoil of their real lives,
162400	168600	and in that escape we try to find answers for the problems we face in our own minds, and one of those comes down to mental health.
168600	174600	Depression and so on are complex topics, we need to be able to distinguish between when we may be experiencing mood dips,
174600	178000	and when we actually have an imbalance that disposes us to be depressed.
178000	185000	A great example of the confusion of the two was Prince EA's video, on how you're not depressed, you just shut up, and that.
185000	190800	Also, it was great to see that Prince EA made the Mental Health Awareness Day on YouTube,
190800	195400	after such an inspirational set of videos, YouTube really know their creators.
195400	201000	YouTubers know that speaking about mental health is extremely sensitive, you can't be seen as taking advantage of the topic,
201000	206200	but equally we are in a culture where people are being encouraged to be open about their experiences with conditions,
206200	210400	and often being open about these things can help others, and we certainly shouldn't diminish that.
210400	217200	On the other hand, we shouldn't be seen as clickbaiting it, or taking advantage of the possible experiences of suffering to emotionally manipulate our audiences,
217200	224000	so ironically it becomes a whole different balancing act on working out how to appear genuine, which in a way is contrived within itself.
224000	230000	But that's a topic for a different time, creators who address these topics in their videos will create a bond with their audience,
230000	234400	sharing an experience, and maybe helping an individual to come to terms with their own struggles,
234400	239400	so it made perfect sense to better help reach out to these lovely creators who are renowned for their reputability,
239400	243400	to promote their therapy website, and help others make it through the same struggles.
243600	246400	But there's a catch, in fact there are a lot of catches.
246400	250800	You see, we over on the YouTube platform are critical bastards, particularly in commentary,
250800	256400	and YouTube, although not being exactly quite on the level of attention as much that comes along with celebrity status,
256400	261600	still comes under investigation from commentators and media alike, and BetterHelp should have known this,
261600	267400	because regardless of what is discussed in the next 20, 30, 40 fucking minutes, I don't know how long this is gonna be,
267400	271800	the fact that they've been caught in such a whirlwind of controversy shows they must have done something wrong,
271800	278000	and it should be a lesson to them, but we'd be dishing out lessons all day today, like you're attending a college course,
278000	284800	and this motherfucker right here is handing out scholarships, because really this whole thing goes a lot deeper than just BetterHelp.
284800	290000	Today I'm going to be asking what is wrong with BetterHelp, if there's anything wrong with the YouTubers who promote it,
290000	296000	and if there's anything wrong with their responses, because my exams may be over, but we're just getting started.
296000	299200	So without further ado, let's dive right in.
302800	309800	Now, people have pretty much gone top to bottom of every single inconsistency within the website and its presentation,
309800	314800	so when I clicked on, I expected to be mostly doing a clean-up job with a lot of the morsels left behind,
314800	322800	but I was wrong, and I do have a lot to say, however firstly I'll give you a rundown of the set of controversies they've faced down in the last few weeks.
322800	326800	I definitely recommend checking out PewDiePie's videos, this covers it a lot,
326800	332800	their terms and conditions contained information that was rather sketchy, basically setting out the company as merely a third party,
332800	336800	most notably even though they claim to run background checks on their therapist,
336800	343800	they don't take responsibility if it's revealed that the therapist isn't actually qualified, a very unsettling clause,
343800	347800	mainly for the reason that it might lead to employees being lax on the background checks,
347800	353800	which might end up letting some unqualified and seedy individuals in, such as Dr. Al Dershberger.
353800	360800	Now, Big Al here is under indictment for rape charges, I want to emphasise, as always, that an individual is innocent until proven guilty,
360800	368800	and people losing their job over any fake accusations is a legitimate concern, however equally when you're having people in positions of mental health counselling,
368800	375800	a significantly more sensitive job, it might be best to not give them a platform until the charges are heard out at least.
375800	382800	You could also make the point that an individual's occupation should not necessarily define whether they should be allowed to operate in their position,
382800	388800	this is not an unfair point either, but I feel that given BetterHelp's self acclaimed status as a facilitator,
388800	391800	for them it might be best to err on the side of caution with these issues.
391800	396800	Also, this is only a real source of criticism, because when it was pointed out, they quickly removed his page,
396800	401800	which says to me that it was more about a lack of vetting rather than just a different philosophy.
401800	407800	Equally, there are many people who provide testaments where their therapist didn't appear to be sufficiently qualified in their behaviour,
407800	414800	at least towards these individuals, I think this raises one of the first greater philosophical concerns, BetterHelp is a large corporation,
414800	418800	and there is no denying that there are many people who have had positive experiences,
418800	422800	nor am I denying that there are an array of qualified individuals doing a great job,
422800	428800	but there is an incredible shifting of responsibility which makes the website prone to such mishaps.
428800	434800	With any hierarchy, there are people who are expected to be held accountable for the employment of their subordinates,
434800	440800	and in a clinic, this is typically localised to an extent, although chains may have national managers and CEOs,
440800	446800	you'll typically have some sort of branch manager who has that power, BetterHelp seems to have less of a structure when it comes to that,
446800	452800	and although they have dedicated sectors, the lack of involvement seems to have alienated management from these issues,
452800	457800	meaning that they had let their growing criticism slip through the cracks, and this was culminating on the review sites,
457800	461800	although responses were predominantly positive, there was a significant proportion that were negative,
461800	464800	and really there's a lot less room for error when dealing with mental health,
464800	472800	and if these people had legitimate complaints, they probably should have been given more attention before BetterHelp decided to launch their platform into the public eye,
472800	476800	however going on their website, the reviews are fairly positive, even with a video review,
476800	481800	while some must have been particularly passionate to submit their experience through the form of a video,
481800	485800	apart from the fact that this guy was actually a paid Fiverr bloke, and I wish I was joking,
485800	492800	so the credibility of such testimonials comes under scrutiny, particularly given how generic and banal many of these reviews seem,
492800	496800	and when comparing these testaments to the more mixed experiences documented elsewhere,
496800	501800	this is all part of a greater point however, the marketing, as mentioned some people like BetterHelp,
501800	507800	some people have had positive experiences, in fact it's very likely that a majority of people have had positive experiences,
507800	513800	however the truth is that when your job is merely to provide a platform and some dodgy practitioners are operating
513800	517800	just because they say they're not responsible doesn't mean other people aren't going to hold them responsible,
517800	521800	they should have sorted out these concerns earlier, and instead we're here now,
521800	525800	in response to a lot of the criticism BetterHelp founder Alon Matas posted a response,
525800	528800	which honestly just made themselves look worse in my opinion,
528800	534800	Matas basically set up straw men of people's concerns, talking about certain claims like the ones where the therapists were AIs,
534800	540800	before saying how ridiculous they were, the simple truth is that even though some narratives were undoubtedly exaggerated,
540800	546800	the concerns came from a legitimate place, and that cannot be undermined by pointing out the most far-fetched points of view,
546800	553800	it came across as a very salty response, and make no mistake, sometimes YouTube, fandoms, etc can overreact,
553800	558800	I think it's perfectly reasonable to criticise when people go too far, in my Zoella video for example I make that clear,
558800	565800	but equally the context of Matas being the founder of BetterHelp and the apparent presentation that this is him defending himself against the allegations
565800	572800	means that people will not perceive this response well, and although I think discussing whether people are overreacting is a legitimate discourse that needs to be had,
572800	578800	it just doesn't feel like he presented it as that, on top of this he was so aggressive and braggadocious in the response,
578800	585800	that it came across as extremely narcissistic, he brags about how this controversy has brought so many new sign-ups, like why?
585800	591800	It didn't leave me with a feeling of confidence in him, everyone knows that BetterHelp has a lot of clients and many of them are happy,
592800	598800	I'm not saying these aren't achievements to be proud of, but they're not relevant to the discussion,
598800	603800	even the more ludicrous claims, it just feels like you're appealing to a greater morality to deflect the allegations,
603800	609800	if we want to discuss the cultural impact of BetterHelp then we will, but the specific problems aren't alleviated by that,
609800	613800	in the words of famous philosopher Brian Quang Le, it's irrelevant.
613800	620800	Another very interesting fact was how Alan viewed BetterHelp himself, in one paragraph he takes the time to actually respond to one of the legitimate criticisms,
620800	625800	and does admit that he made a mistake of including what are called the get out of jail free clause,
625800	630800	and referred to it as standard legalese, which I think is one of the biggest problems with BetterHelp,
630800	634800	they seem to lapse into these moments where they view themselves as a corporation like any other,
634800	639800	and mental health isn't like any other, mental health should not have a market value,
639800	646800	it's not a commodity to be bought and sold, and therefore having quote standard legalese that absolves your responsibility isn't really on,
646800	651800	and does create legitimate concerns, however he admitted it was wrong so I won't give him too much stigma,
651800	658800	but it's definitely something worth thinking about going forward, you are not just any old company who can simply throw down a copy and pasted terms and conditions,
658800	663800	also we all make spelling mistakes, but once again, maybe just spell check a bit, just a thought,
663800	668800	now we could finish here and get onto the YouTubers, but we're not finished, oh how I wish we were,
668800	673800	because I said I'd give this an original spin, and this is where we come back to the marketing point.
677800	687800	Now I have been doing psychology as a subject for a good few years alongside my politics, philosophy and international law,
687800	694800	and part of what they teach is research methods, which is analysing and replicating the techniques used in psychological studies,
694800	703800	so I became particularly intrigued when I noticed on their front page they boasted a 98% rate of individuals involved in their programs making significant progress,
703800	709800	despite the fact that only 70% experienced an alleged reduction in depression, which is a rather sizeable margin,
709800	716800	considering I'd assume a reduction in symptoms is correlated with the idea of progress, but still 70% is significant,
716800	723800	and hey, they were conducted by the Berkeley Wellbeing Institute, sounds like a very reputable place, am I right or am I right,
723800	730800	I mean how could I be wrong, I'm the right opinion, so I decided to take my expertise and investigate this study a bit more closely,
730800	735800	after all these are some pretty noteworthy bragging rights, and there were two studies, two, not just one,
735800	740800	so let's have a look at them and break them down and see if we can find any little mistakes.
740800	747800	Now what may stand out to some people straight out the gate is the gynocentrism, which is known as the predominance of women in the study,
747800	756800	and although definitely having 78 and 80% females can skew results, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that the pool of subjects was just restricted,
756800	766800	a point that we'll address very soon, no. What immediately struck me was how they restricted the participants in the results to individuals who have been clients of BetterHelp for 3 months and 2 weeks at least,
766800	774800	which will immediately skew results as it's a significant amount of time, and a high majority of people who are dissatisfied with the treatment they're receiving will have dropped out before then.
774800	780800	Participant dropout is a considerable problem with any study, however with an overwhelming majority of research,
780800	785800	normally a study will explain how these sample of individuals were taken, for example if they put out an ad in a newspaper,
785800	791800	there is no clarification in this study, so I cannot possibly comment on the validity of the assemblence of such individuals,
791800	796800	if these people were already intent on signing up to BetterHelp then you're skewing the study group's decisions.
796800	801800	Now that may not be the case, but there is no comment on such, so how can I compare?
801800	807800	And although they do comment on the participant dropout, they do not clarify how many participants dropped out, which is extremely suspicious,
807800	813800	if they ran this study from day one like they claimed, they should have clear statistics on the number of people who exited the study.
813800	817800	As they took questionnaires at the start, this should have been easy, and they need to include this,
817800	822800	because to provide an example, if 90% of participants dropped out citing ineffectiveness of the therapy,
822800	828800	then the 70% of the 10% left who experienced decreased depression symptoms, it wouldn't mean jack shit.
828800	833800	I highly doubt it's anything like 90% dropout for your information, but they have to include that statistic,
833800	838800	otherwise I find the contents of this study completely invalid, and I quote,
838800	845800	This approach may have led to a bias, including people in the study who favoured BetterHelp e-counselling, wow, just maybe.
845800	848800	I think these researchers might be onto something here, lads.
848800	854800	On top of this, the study failed to use any control group to make the comparison of BetterHelp's therapy with regards to face-to-face,
854800	858800	and although not necessarily a requirement with regards to the variables being used,
858800	866800	given how one of their claims is the preference over face-to-face therapy, it bemuses me why they wouldn't take advantage of their most scientific opportunity to prove it.
866800	874800	But as noted on their page, they do note that their clients have a specific predilection towards their content over face-to-face,
874800	878800	so how did they source such information? As said, it was backed up by research.
878800	880800	Well, let's talk about the second study.
880800	884800	This study is much worse than the first one, because there is no pretreatment questionnaire,
884800	888800	you could only respond to this questionnaire if you had already taken treatment for three months,
888800	894800	which is unbelievably terrible methodology, like I cannot begin to explain how awful that is.
894800	901800	I've already explained how this is a flawed approach on the first study, but at least they took the evaluations before the treatment, like come on guys.
901800	909800	Anyhow, one of the other possible components of the other study was that they had 318 participants, not the most, but a decent amount.
909800	917800	This study had the grand total of 48 participants for one set of questions, and 38 for the comparison of face-to-face therapy.
917800	926800	So you know that 98% statistic that's on the front page? That was literally 47 people, and the one person who said otherwise was the 2%.
926800	930800	This is some excellent data collection, lads. Excellent data collection.
930800	937800	And as said, they had the perfect opportunity to conduct comparative research between the effects of face-to-face therapy and online therapy.
937800	944800	Why did they decide to undertake such unreliable methods to provide validity to their claims when there were better options?
944800	949800	Equally, in his written defence, matters boast that they've helped hundreds of thousands of people,
949800	957800	and yet a study proving its success that is promoted on the front page could only gather 48 people. Only 48.
957800	960800	I wish I was finished criticising this study, but I'm not.
960800	965800	Throughout the study, it is infested with this annoyingly complementary tone towards better help.
965800	973800	For these reasons, the present research enables us to begin clarifying the unique benefits of a high-quality and modality-integrated e-cancelling platform.
973800	979800	This is at the start of the study. If a study sets out to prove how good something is, chances are it's a tad biased.
979800	984800	There are many more examples of such high praise that I'll chuck on the screen now, I don't need to read them out.
984800	989800	On top of this, the study fails to distinguish between e-therapy and better help therapy,
989800	996800	as if better help has trademarked e-therapy, and it completely ignores the premise that there are already plenty of other online therapy sites,
996800	1002800	and therefore just turns into an extended ad for better help, and just equivocates better help to online therapy in general.
1002800	1009800	To summarise, I'm not a fan of the study. It also doesn't help that the individual central to the Berkeley Institute well-being,
1009800	1016800	Cheeky S. Davis, has a testimonial page, and on that testimonial page is a better help community and support manager,
1016800	1023800	Noor Baker, who sings high praises for Davis, saying that she has been a vital part of better help's research efforts,
1023800	1028800	so it appears that these people are quite closely associated, a highly personal team player, I'm sure.
1029800	1032800	All this data is completely manipulated.
1032800	1038800	Now in response to this information, Mr. Matters here may say, well, it's just a corporate thing, and that's true to an extent.
1038800	1047800	I highly doubt that those L'Oreal adverts that show that 80% of women have skin that feels smoother after application are studies done under scientific conditions,
1047800	1052800	but that's what annoys me. Better help seems to want to present themselves as better than your average company,
1052800	1057800	but equally with that comes a level of trust. That means they can't just behave like any other corporation,
1057800	1061800	they shouldn't be going around manipulating data, and they will be held to higher standards.
1061800	1069800	Psychological studies are extremely important to the scientific community, particularly in working out which methods of therapy work best for the public.
1069800	1077800	BetterHelp or Davis have taken advantage of this structure and made a study that looks appealing from the outside but does not warrant front-page claims,
1077800	1082800	and having something like 98% made significant progress is inherently misleading.
1082800	1089800	And this comes back to what's annoyed a lot of people, whether it's the very suspicious reviews, the failure to want to take responsibility,
1089800	1096800	or this little debacle that I've just unpacked. It's the contradiction, on one hand they proudly proclaim the positive results they've received
1096800	1103800	and represent themselves as this highly reputable site with scientific backing, on the other hand their conduct is very corporate and manipulative,
1103800	1111800	which would be normal in a way for a business if it weren't dealing with people's mental health, and this is the epitome of corporate tactics.
1111800	1118800	It's not what people want for such a website, you can't be the good guys while acting like that, you can't have your cake and eat it.
1118800	1123800	But you know who can? YouTubers. Well, let's get a slice.
1125800	1132800	With all this research, it may come as a surprise that BetterHelp has been promoted for a while by YouTubers all over the platform,
1132800	1140800	many of them are people with strong moral grounding, DeFranco, Boogie, Jaxfilms, Shane Dawson, H3, some of whom we'll touch on later.
1140800	1147800	Firstly, I want to talk about why on earth YouTubers would be so keen to jump on something so precarious, I mean we're dealing with mental health here.
1147800	1155800	As PewDiePie said, anything like that is a rickety bridge, particularly when you're dealing with sponsors, some audiences won't want you even putting ads on a video about mental health,
1155800	1161800	and although I'd say I'm arguably slightly more easy going than that, I can still see why it is a cause for concern.
1161800	1166800	We have come a long way as content creators to move towards this more open era of discussion,
1166800	1172800	however I think it's really important to emphasise that these individuals are only projecting their own personal experiences,
1172800	1179800	and though these experiences may help you come to terms with your own personal conditions, the best course of action is to then seek confirmation through an expert.
1179800	1186800	Now I do not deny that BetterHelp is a relatively professional site, however even they agree that they cannot provide formal diagnoses,
1186800	1191800	but I'm sure there are a few therapists who haven't got that message given how discreetly it's been delivered.
1191800	1196800	Point is, when you have a video talking about mental health and then say, and this is sponsored by BetterHelp,
1196800	1203800	it does not serve as a fully endorsed supplement to the problems that you may be working on to discover, even they won't endorse themselves.
1203800	1209800	Once again, it could well be a get out of jail free clause, but I don't think that makes it any more setful in those instances.
1209800	1218800	On the other hand, I don't want to completely trash the concept of online therapy, as it can provide important support for those who have fears of even going outside,
1218800	1222800	some people who may not have the privilege of affording face to face, that shit ain't cheap.
1222800	1228800	And so when thinking about this, when the fact that BetterHelp emphasized these elements to many of the YouTubers who promoted it,
1228800	1233800	many of them who've probably been in the same positions, I can understand why some of them seem very keen.
1233800	1239800	I spoke to Boogie about this in a conversation, and one of the things that he said he did was try the site out for himself,
1239800	1245800	and this is something that a lot of creators emphasized, and their experience with such individuals on the site was pretty great.
1245800	1250800	So suddenly, what happened with BetterHelp was the shoe that fit Cinderella's foot for many of these YouTubers.
1250800	1256800	Many of us are cooped up inside a lot, many of us do suffer from mental health issues, you have to be kind of insane to do YouTube,
1256800	1264800	it's a draining occupation, because although in some ways it is easier, the networking and the business makes it a ruthless job to go anywhere,
1264800	1270800	you really have to be willing to put in the extra shift, because there's always someone out there willing to go that one step further than you,
1270800	1277800	and that environment won't just shape people, but it'll also attract people of that certain persuasion, and so the market for this was huge.
1277800	1283800	This is likely why many YouTubers did rush to promote it, after all, they had their positive experiences,
1283800	1289800	they saw the general feedback, and it all looks pretty affirmative, and many of these creators have done brand deals before,
1289800	1293800	on top of this, you know, promoting something like this, it makes you look good.
1293800	1298800	There's no doubt about that, whether it was their intention or not, promoting mental health stuff is good,
1298800	1301800	you know, you might help people, and you'll come out with a better image.
1301800	1306800	Many of these creators have done brand deals before, many of them are used to promoting content,
1306800	1312800	and let's be honest, who reads the terms and conditions? Why should the content creators make an exception this time round?
1312800	1316800	Well, because it's an exceptional situation, and it comes back to mental health.
1316800	1322800	I'm going to try and avoid repeating myself too much here, but YouTubers can't go around and treat these sites like any other gig,
1322800	1325800	it was unbelievably naive to think that was a good idea to do so.
1326800	1329800	Now, I'm legitimately not against people being sponsored by such sites,
1329800	1333800	however, it's even more important to be sensitive when you're actually going to be profiting off it.
1333800	1337800	Once again, it's a sponsorship, I wouldn't expect anything else to an extent,
1337800	1341800	but at the same time, a high majority of these people receive money per sign-up,
1341800	1345800	and therefore, it was important that there were things being explained clearly,
1345800	1348800	because you influence how many people sign up.
1348800	1350800	Now, I will hold better help to account to an extent,
1350800	1355800	as I believe they did fail to notify many YouTubers of the little clauses they had inserted,
1355800	1358800	particularly one saying it's not an ample substitute,
1358800	1363800	but responsibility should also fall on the shoulders of content creators for not being more ready to research it.
1363800	1366800	Another problem that was definitely the cause of it spreading so quickly,
1366800	1372800	was the fact that people just saw other YouTubers promoting it and likely judged the brand on the basis of that.
1372800	1375800	As said, better help went after a lot of moral staples in the community,
1375800	1379800	and once they were promoting it, I'm sure many other content creators saw it,
1379800	1383800	and it caused a subsequent domino effect of unfounded trust in it.
1383800	1388800	Building on this trust point, better help was also partly partnered with Philip DeFranco's business Rogue Rocket,
1388800	1393800	and for some YouTubers being reached by a trusted member of the community probably instilled a sense of faith,
1393800	1397800	even though, as mentioned in other videos, that was all it essentially did.
1397800	1400800	Given the business model of taking a cut at the sign-up,
1400800	1404800	better help could have as many YouTubers promoted as possible without losing any money.
1404800	1408800	It's natural for companies to want more sign-ups, more money, and so on.
1408800	1410800	I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with that,
1410800	1415800	equally the YouTubers being used to promote this were definitely using their trust over their viewers,
1415800	1417800	which is likely why the backlash has been so strong,
1417800	1421800	because you're putting forward a case for a website that deals with mental health,
1421800	1425800	and you're subsequently profiting off them, it has to be watertight, and it wasn't.
1425800	1427800	I watched a lot of these promotions for these sites,
1427800	1431800	and generally I didn't think many of the creators were acting in bad faith,
1431800	1433800	I think they just didn't know better.
1433800	1437800	Going forward, I don't think they have to plow through the terms and conditions for all their future products,
1437800	1441800	though it's not a bad idea, but I definitely recommend being a bit more meticulous,
1441800	1444800	at least for certain products, and making sure that what you're promoting
1444800	1448800	is something that a person will be able to make a clear conscious decision to go into,
1448800	1451800	particularly if everything is not as clear as it seems.
1451800	1457800	The problem is that sponsors typically place a shared responsibility on the creator and the user,
1457800	1460800	the creator to deliver a truthful perception of the service,
1460800	1463800	and the user to make that conscious decision to involve themselves with the product.
1463800	1467800	The problem with mental health promotion is that you're dealing with people who could be vulnerable,
1467800	1469800	and thus may have diminished responsibility,
1469800	1474800	therefore shifting even more responsibility to deliver an honest presentation onto the creator,
1474800	1479800	and unfortunately because they misused that responsibility, people felt more animosity towards them.
1479800	1484800	Now this immediately means that regardless of how earnest the intentions of these creators were,
1484800	1487800	they were going to be staring down a significant amount of criticism
1487800	1489800	because of the shortfalls of the site and the marketing.
1489800	1494800	At the end of the day, they were equally a part of the marketing as the Botch study and the Forge reviews,
1494800	1497800	and although they were likely misled, they're still autonomous beings,
1497800	1499800	and they still have a level of responsibility,
1499800	1503800	and as always on my channel, this makes the responses to such criticism
1503800	1507800	just as important as the criticism itself, which is where we'll go now.
1510800	1514800	One of the creators who was sponsored by BetterHelp was the YouTuber Domics.
1514800	1517800	Now he's an animator, and as noted in previous videos,
1518800	1521800	we already know that they have quite a tight relationship with their audience,
1521800	1523800	and that manifests a lot of trust.
1523800	1528800	Also, given the audience of such creators, it probably means that this could appeal to such a demographic.
1528800	1532800	Following the BetterHelp incident, he put out this set of tweets.
1532800	1534800	In my opinion, this was the best way to respond.
1534800	1538800	He acknowledges the flaws, acknowledges the mistakes that he made on his part,
1538800	1542800	and relinquishes the gains that he made of it due to his lack of awareness,
1542800	1544800	and this is an important point.
1544800	1547800	At the end of the day, whether BetterHelp is being misframed or not.
1547800	1552800	Even if it was a great site, the lack of further research is something that would be a flaw
1552800	1554800	regardless of the site's performance.
1554800	1558800	If people were more familiar with the site, they could have either spoken to the site prior,
1558800	1562800	and perhaps had some changes, or they might not have proceeded with such a sponsorship.
1562800	1565800	On the other hand, they may have been in a better position to defend it.
1565800	1568800	At this point, it's reasonable to hold up your hands and say,
1568800	1571800	I was ignorant to these things. I don't think that's a crime.
1571800	1574800	But it is a mistake given the context of the sponsorship.
1574800	1578800	You have to vet a bit more tightly, which is why this is probably the best way to respond,
1578800	1582800	because regardless of the context, it's a mistake that many of them were guilty of.
1582800	1586800	Another thing that a lot of creators said was that they did actually sign up and try it,
1586800	1588800	and many of them had positive experiences,
1588800	1593800	and then wrongly assumed that their experience spoke louder than any individual problems.
1593800	1597800	These are all mistakes that any associated creator can accept.
1597800	1600800	I can accept them. Most YouTubers took that route.
1600800	1604800	Many bluntly stated that they were ending any relationship with better help.
1604800	1608800	Another fairly safe response. You don't want your words to be twisted.
1608800	1612800	However, there was another way to respond, which is where we're going now.
1612800	1617800	The sort of responses that we've just spoken about is when a person facing down these allegations
1617800	1620800	can accept they've made a mistake, and be apologetic.
1620800	1624800	The positives are that it often means that people are forgiving of us,
1624800	1626800	and it means that hopefully we can move on.
1626800	1631800	However, it can also be a negative, as if we feel that what's been committed isn't that bad.
1631800	1634800	By apologizing, we push the standards up for what we view as wrong.
1634800	1639800	Equally, if we apologize for too much, we seem weak, and too intent to please others,
1639800	1644800	and then it creates the question of how we keep making these mistakes again, and again, and again.
1644800	1648800	Apologies cannot be overused, or else they become disingenuous,
1648800	1651800	and the whole notion of an apology implies that we want to do better.
1651800	1655800	So apologizing continuously diminishes the meaning of each apology,
1655800	1658800	and will make people more critical every time you try to do it.
1658800	1661800	For that reason, this leads us to the other side of the spectrum,
1661800	1665800	where there are some people who remain completely steadfast on what they've done,
1665800	1668800	and are never prepared to admit that they've made mistakes.
1668800	1672800	Now, I have to admit, I think even as the most informed person,
1672800	1676800	it would be hard to defend a position in this situation without taking a hit.
1676800	1680800	But there are people who do this in these sorts of situations,
1680800	1683800	mainly because they shoehorn themselves into such circumstances.
1683800	1687800	I understand the logic, sometimes by coming out against allegations in an aggressive manner,
1687800	1692800	you can shut them down, but equally, if these allegations have more grounding than you anticipate them to be,
1692800	1696800	you can come across as unnecessarily defensive and insecure,
1696800	1700800	leading to increased suspicion on your involvement with such a predicament,
1700800	1702800	which is where we lead to Philip DeFranco.
1702800	1705800	Now, I made a sympathetic video in the past on DeFranco.
1705800	1710800	At the time, it was my best performing video, and it was a great achievement,
1710800	1714800	brought me lots of new fans, many of whom I assume are mutual fans of DeFranco.
1714800	1718800	Hey there, if you're one of them and you're still watching, I appreciate your service.
1718800	1722800	I stand by what I said in that video, these points do not change,
1722800	1726800	but his response was definitely taking a page out of Alan Mattis' book,
1726800	1729800	which isn't necessarily a good way to respond.
1729800	1734800	Initially, this response was well received, but once commentators made responses,
1734800	1738800	and even Colossal published one to the Bated channel, a lot of cracks began to show.
1738800	1741800	Once again, as a response to many of the points that DeFranco set up,
1741800	1743800	they weren't unreasonable responses,
1743800	1748800	but the problem is that it was premised as a response to the whole better help situation.
1748800	1752800	But Philly D was very carefully picking out points that he was responding to,
1752800	1756800	and once again, if you want to defend yourself against some of the more ridiculous allegations,
1756800	1760800	it's not a bad position, but there is less acknowledgement of wrongdoing
1760800	1762800	than in Alan's hackneyed response.
1762800	1765800	I think this is aggravated by the fact that Philip said this.
1765800	1768800	And also to everyone in general, I apologize if I end up repeating things,
1768800	1772800	I know I talked about this last Thursday, but I think just in one dedicated setting,
1772800	1775800	it's important that I hit on all the notes,
1775800	1778800	since for some reason, depending on who is talking about this story,
1778800	1783800	certain parts are excluded, or glossed over, or exaggerated, or misconstrued.
1783800	1785800	And this is probably true to an extent,
1785800	1788800	but it's very clear that Philip's portrayal isn't comprehensive either.
1788800	1790800	BetterHelp has been a sponsor of our videos,
1790800	1792800	we've even partnered with them at a company level
1792800	1794800	to help them with other sponsorships with other YouTubers,
1794800	1796800	and so that clip has been misconstrued as,
1796800	1799800	oh, that's the smoking gun, that is the evidence that Philip DeFranco,
1799800	1802800	he is invested, he is part of the, he is the mastermind.
1802800	1804800	Well, I wouldn't use the term smoking gun,
1804800	1807800	but it could be, in the sense you didn't reveal you were partnered with BetterHelp
1807800	1809800	before you sponsored with them.
1809800	1811800	You've now clarified that your first sponsorship with them was made
1811800	1814800	before you partnered with them, which is fine,
1814800	1816800	but what about all the others you did after that?
1816800	1820800	There's a lack of transparency here, which should be an obvious concern to anyone,
1820800	1823800	because you're promoting something that you've got an invested interest in.
1823800	1826800	And it's one that goes beyond your standard sponsorship, I think.
1826800	1830800	That doesn't have to mean you've literally invested in BetterHelp yourself,
1830800	1834800	but not disclosing your partnership makes all your sponsorships,
1834800	1837800	other than the first one now, a clear conflict of interest.
1837800	1840800	Sit down and ask yourself if you benefit from BetterHelp's success
1840800	1844800	even without a DeFranco sponsorship, and the answer will be yes.
1844800	1846800	And once this was observed by other creators,
1846800	1848800	he quickly fell victim to the consequences.
1848800	1850800	Responding to criticism is a balancing act,
1850800	1853800	knowing when to apologise, and knowing when to rebut.
1853800	1856800	And DeFranco clearly has a faith in BetterHelp,
1856800	1858800	maybe a product of his investment,
1858800	1862800	but the problem is that people have already taken that point of view into account,
1862800	1865800	and therefore DeFranco's presentation for these critics
1865800	1868800	have this delusion about BetterHelp that needs to be corrected
1868800	1870800	before we can even have a discussion,
1870800	1873800	a discussion that DeFranco doesn't even get to in the video,
1873800	1875800	is inherently condescending.
1875800	1879800	It's clear that DeFranco wanted to keep BetterHelp in positive standing with the video,
1879800	1883800	and defend its position, and really, he may have been the person to do that,
1883800	1885800	but I think it was a lose-lose predicament,
1885800	1887800	that if he had addressed the worst arguments,
1887800	1890800	people would call him out for not addressing the best ones,
1890800	1893800	and if he addressed the best ones, he'd probably have a hard time,
1893800	1894800	because you can't counter them,
1894800	1898800	particularly when BetterHelp had already pulled pages and information
1898800	1899800	that had been criticised,
1899800	1903800	meaning that they had already implicitly admitted they'd made such mistakes.
1903800	1906800	So the only argument that you can make is that BetterHelp,
1906800	1910800	as a greater product, hasn't been that tainted,
1910800	1913800	and that argument just wouldn't wash with viewers in the current state.
1913800	1916800	So DeFranco arguably did the best he could with the quote,
1916800	1918800	defensive argument, but it wasn't enough,
1918800	1921800	and in my opinion, he should have accepted there were mistakes,
1921800	1922800	and just admitted it.
1922800	1924800	I don't think there was any way out of it.
1924800	1927800	One of the aspects DeFranco mentioned in his video
1927800	1930800	was that he would be taking a trip to the headquarters of BetterHelp
1930800	1932800	to ascertain their mode of operation.
1932800	1934800	To me, it seemed like a fairly harmless venture,
1934800	1936800	but one that wouldn't really change anything.
1936800	1940800	Following this, he uploaded this post explaining his position on it,
1940800	1942800	and honestly, I read the first paragraph,
1942800	1944800	and it seemed like he was making a lot of sense.
1944800	1945800	But then he says this,
1945800	1948800	With that all said, we'll be fully ending our relationship with BetterHelp.
1948800	1951800	This is not based on anything that came from the meeting,
1951800	1954800	but from a place of understanding that part of the community
1954800	1957800	just does not feel it as appropriate to have a sponsorship with a company
1957800	1959800	in the mental health space.
1959800	1961800	And this annoyed me. It did.
1961800	1964800	And I'm a fairly placid person, so it must mean something.
1964800	1966800	I want to say something about it.
1970800	1974800	It's not that people weren't ready for a sponsorship with mental health.
1974800	1976800	There are many of us who accept that under the premise,
1976800	1977800	this could be a good idea.
1977800	1980800	This could be something that works and changes lives.
1980800	1983800	And for a while, many people promoted BetterHelp without repercussions.
1983800	1985800	Sure, there were some people who were protesting it,
1985800	1987800	but they're not people who caused this.
1987800	1990800	No, what caused this was the shifting tide in public sentiment
1990800	1993800	about the credibility of the website, based on significant problems
1993800	1995800	which they themselves clearly submitted to.
1995800	1998800	Yes, people probably had bad experiences with therapists,
1998800	2002800	and obviously, in light of scandals, these complaints came to the forefront of the discourse.
2002800	2006800	But at the same time, this was equally a deeper problem with marketing and philosophy.
2006800	2008800	Shifting responsibility onto the community,
2008800	2011800	as if they're not happy with any mental health websites at all,
2011800	2013800	just seems like a kick in the teeth.
2013800	2016800	Barely a few lines after you admitted that they had problems,
2016800	2018800	whether you consider them derisory or not.
2018800	2021800	YouTubers have this real problem of understanding sometimes.
2021800	2024800	Besides the stories that have come to light of recent,
2024800	2026800	it's what an environment like that can breed.
2026800	2031800	It's the potential, when people see companies shifting responsibility with such clauses,
2031800	2033800	when people see companies manipulating their market,
2033800	2036800	whether the service is good right now is besides the point,
2036800	2039800	because when you have a company that's willing to behave like that,
2039800	2042800	people lose trust because of what might happen in the future,
2042800	2044800	and what they might let happen.
2044800	2046800	In my opinion, you should be empathetic to that.
2046800	2050800	People were right to criticize it because it gave them too much leverage
2050800	2052800	for exploitation to occur within that site,
2052800	2056800	and for you to then say that you'd heard the stories that people had told you,
2056800	2059800	and you presented them to them at the BetterHelp headquarters,
2059800	2062800	and then going back to conclude that there was a community
2062800	2064800	who just wasn't cool with mental health is audacious,
2064800	2066800	as if we were the ones responsible.
2066800	2069800	We don't have to change. We should be critical.
2069800	2072800	We should drive home these principles of companies being honest,
2072800	2074800	whether it's in the advertising or in the fine print,
2074800	2076800	particularly when dealing with the issue of mental health.
2076800	2080800	It's not dollar-shave club sponsorship where the results are fairly consistent,
2080800	2083800	and you'll get a nice clean-shaven chinny-chin-chin.
2083800	2085800	There is an immense amount of trust being levied here.
2085800	2088800	It is the company that needs to change, not us.
2088800	2091800	Whether it was the fake testimonials, the get-out-of-jail-free clauses,
2091800	2095800	or the pseudo-scientific study that was being used to try and elevate their results,
2095800	2099800	they were the ones who weren't ready, not us.
2099800	2102800	I spoke to a lot of community members, a lot of content creators,
2102800	2105800	and the sentiment was that they wanted to promote and support this,
2105800	2109800	but they found themselves ultimately in a corner where the company they wanted to support
2109800	2111800	hadn't presented themselves honestly.
2111800	2116800	And as marketers and beneficiaries, they became implicated in this.
2116800	2120800	When people sign up to BetterHelp, it was presented like it was a substitute,
2120800	2122800	so it became an assumption to the viewer.
2122800	2125800	The only thing that was constantly mentioned in the BetterHelp adverts
2125800	2127800	were that it wasn't an emergency hotline.
2127800	2129800	Other than that, no details were given.
2129800	2133800	It is also assumed that the people who hired the therapists, BetterHelp themselves,
2133800	2135800	would take some level of responsibility.
2135800	2137800	It is instinctively assumed that the reviews were honest,
2137800	2141800	the research is honest, with content creators using that trust.
2141800	2144800	Promoting this, they became the source of the statement
2144800	2146800	because they had promoted these assumptions,
2146800	2149800	that although I believe they assumed too, they should have known better,
2149800	2154800	because the trust that their audience has in them reinforces those assumptions.
2154800	2156800	One of the things about mental health is its uniqueness.
2156800	2158800	No two people have the same mentality.
2158800	2161800	It's all one huge mess, and we on YouTube, we're all messes.
2161800	2163800	Nothing is new about that.
2163800	2167800	But we need to be clear in what's being offered and who it's being offered to.
2167800	2169800	Signing up to BetterHelp and having a good experience
2169800	2172800	isn't evidence that every experience is going to be good.
2172800	2175800	YouTubers share a lot of mental health experiences and I think it's important,
2175800	2178800	and often the overarching narratives of their stories
2178800	2180800	can touch on a general struggle that is felt by many.
2180800	2183800	But equally, they shouldn't equate this to everyone's struggle,
2183800	2186800	and in this instance, they need to look at the roots of what they were supporting
2186800	2190800	rather than just the singular experience that they had and working outwards.
2190800	2193800	They need to go bottom up rather than top down.
2193800	2198800	To understand mental health is different to just experiencing the complications facing it,
2198800	2200800	and it's a tricky, tight-rope to tread.
2200800	2203800	I think that going forward, everyone has a responsibility to know what they're promoting
2203800	2206800	will be right for their audience when it comes to sensitive topics,
2206800	2209800	because I do believe in some perks of online therapy.
2209800	2212800	It won't be for everyone, but for those people, it may be an important first step.
2212800	2217800	For people who have problems leaving the house and such, these are real changes that can be made.
2217800	2221800	I don't want this video to be just a bashing of the premise of online therapy.
2221800	2224800	No, I'm just bashing this execution.
2224800	2226800	It's a message to those who should do better.
2226800	2229800	When you can do better, why wouldn't you?
2229800	2232800	I want to close this video by providing you with a little allegory
2232800	2236800	from my current philosophy professor, who was actually a really interesting bloke.
2236800	2240800	Big props to him for being one of the first tutors to make philosophy interesting.
2240800	2244800	And he said that when dealing with much of the moral philosophy that we were covering,
2244800	2247800	that moral arguments are like a speed limit we set.
2247800	2250800	We can't expect that everyone will drive within that speed limit.
2250800	2254800	Many people will behave outside of what is considered acceptable from time to time.
2254800	2259800	By setting the speed limit, we move that responsibility onto the driver,
2259800	2261800	and they become accountable for their actions.
2261800	2265800	If we didn't set that speed limit, then people are free to drive as fast as we want,
2265800	2267800	possibly with dangerous consequences,
2267800	2270800	and people will look to us, the hypothetical government,
2270800	2273800	for not putting a speed limit on there, when we knew better.
2273800	2277800	With their behaviour, BetterHelp almost wanted to set a speed limit,
2277800	2280800	but didn't enforce it, for themselves at least,
2280800	2284800	and then tried to waive a responsibility in case an accident happened.
2284800	2287800	On top of this, they failed to market themselves honestly,
2287800	2289800	and at the centre of this were many content creators.
2289800	2294800	YouTubers were caught up because of a huge proportion of the dishonesty that came from the marketing.
2294800	2297800	As said, I doubt that many of them had bad intentions,
2297800	2300800	but they clearly dived into something much deeper than they had anticipated.
2300800	2303800	I think there were some questionable responses to criticism from the company,
2303800	2306800	and from some content creators, that I hope I've addressed comprehensively.
2306800	2311800	For me going forward, I'm ready to support websites that help people cope with the struggles of life.
2311800	2315800	However, we should be very thorough when making sure that what we see is what we get,
2315800	2319800	and that the right structure is in place to hold the right people accountable,
2319800	2322800	because mental health is volatile, and things will go wrong,
2322800	2326800	and when they do, we want responsibility. That's what matters.
2326800	2330800	Better help weren't ready for that, unfortunately.
2330800	2334800	Hopefully next time, whatever comes forward will be.
2334800	2338800	So to finish where I started, H3's response to PewDiePie was very strange,
2338800	2340800	and I don't understand why he made the comments,
2340800	2343800	as if PewDiePie had even slightly directed the video at him,
2343800	2346800	because PewDiePie left a specific disclaimer that this wasn't the case,
2346800	2351800	and I don't think anyone received the impression that Felix was attacking them, let alone them specifically.
2351800	2356800	The way that he presented my involvement in it, I thought was a little misleading,
2356800	2364800	and a little out of context, and it made it look like I was way more involved with this company than I was,
2364800	2373800	or even that it made it look like I used my being depressed to somehow sell better help.
2373800	2376800	Ethan took it far too personally, and he shouldn't be so fragile,
2376800	2379800	but a greater narrative may have to be preserved for another time.
2379800	2382800	I think my time is up with this video. It's gone on long enough.
2382800	2386800	Anyhow, I want to finish up by thanking my editors.
2386800	2388800	Once again, I'm going to leave their links in the pinned comment below.
2388800	2390800	Definitely go and check them out if you have the chance.
2390800	2392800	Some of them are really great content creators,
2392800	2396800	and are definitely moving on to greater things in the future, I'm sure of it.
2396800	2399800	Also, I'd love to hear what you think about this topic below.
2399800	2401800	I'll be reading some of the comments.
2401800	2406800	If you want to reach me personally with a comment, then you can hit me up on Twitter,
2407800	2410800	You can hit me up on Discord, I've got my links in the pinned comment,
2410800	2413800	and on Facebook, I use that too from time to time.
2413800	2416800	So, on all platforms, via Instagram, no Instagram yet.
2416800	2420800	I know, maybe when I become vain enough, I'll download it.
2420800	2423800	I had good fun making this one, even though it's been quite exhausting.
2423800	2427800	This was not the easiest video to make, but we got there in the end.
2427800	2430800	I'd love to hear your thoughts, don't really have anything else to say.
2430800	2431800	I hope you guys are doing well.
2431800	2434800	Until then, however, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
2434800	2454800	Thanks for watching!
