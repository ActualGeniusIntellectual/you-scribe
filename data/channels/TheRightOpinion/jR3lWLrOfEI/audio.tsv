0	4500	Hello, I'm The Right Opinion, and today we talk about the 9,000 pound tuition fees.
5000	6500	Fuck tuition fees.
12000	19000	Off the top of my head, I can't think of a domestic policy that has been more of a waste than the current tuition fees.
19000	24500	If there was a single policy to perfectly symbolise how out of touch, while combining with that faux pas economic interest,
24500	30000	it would be the new tuition fees system, introduced so thoughtfully by the Cameron Clegg administration in 2010,
30000	36000	and with the new plans to increase it with inflation, I thought I'd batter this piece of shit policy once and for all.
36000	42000	Let me present to you a situation. The local council are due on money due to government cuts, and to deal with this they've raised council taxes.
42000	45500	Now, why don't they just raise it, and raise it continuously?
45500	51500	Obviously, because people won't be able to pay it, and therefore they could actually end up raising less money than they were before.
51500	56500	The other issue is if they take away too much money from people, then they won't have enough money to pay their other taxes.
56500	58500	It's about finding that balance.
58500	64500	The reason the 3,000 pound a year tuition fees work to a certain extent, was because there were a lot of people prepared to pay them.
64500	68000	Some would pay them immediately, whereas others would pay them in due course.
68000	73000	Needless to say, the government received money from it, and therefore they couldn't regard it as a terrible policy.
73000	76500	This government cannot find that balance with their current tuition fees.
76500	84000	One of the most insidiously counterproductive policies ever, which has gone under the public radar because it doesn't affect most people who read the newspaper.
84000	90000	The 9,000 a year tuition fees are a near joke, and I cannot understand for the life of me why anyone would endorse such a policy.
90000	94000	It has been estimated that nearly half the students will never be able to pay their student loan.
94000	100500	In fact, there's actually been a lot of estimations which calculate the British government will make less money through this system than the previous one.
100500	104500	Re-emphasizing the point that you can't make money that just isn't there.
104500	111000	And then there's this argument, oh, you only pay it back in small amounts, and after a certain threshold, it's not that bad.
111000	118500	When you have rent, taxes, groceries, travel expenses, and I could go on, every single penny wasted on damn tuition fees seems more impactful.
118500	124500	Subsequently, if people feel financially restricted, then they are less likely to invest money in local infrastructure and business.
124500	131500	I'm sorry, but this should be assumed knowledge from the fucking government. It shouldn't take some tosser on the internet to point it out.
131500	138000	This is near idiocy. They can't even guarantee they'll make the money from the more wealthy students, because let's say someone does a degree in medicine,
138000	142500	and then they decide to move to Australia because Australia offers better contracts to new graduates,
142500	147000	there is literally no guaranteed way of the British government getting that money back.
147000	153500	Given the dissatisfaction with the current health services that many health professionals have, and the scrapping of grants for health students,
153500	157500	I would not be surprised to see an even larger exodus in the coming years.
157500	165500	In the interest of money, which is quite ironic, they are pushing people away, and in effect, they actually may be making less money than if they stuck with the old system.
165500	166500	Oh, the irony.
166500	172000	We need to keep our best and brightest in this country, the people who are intelligent enough to be offered places in different countries,
172000	175000	because in a few years' time, they'll be the largest contributor to the economy.
175000	177500	But to do that, you have to keep them happy in this country.
177500	180500	The way to a man's wallet is through his heart.
180500	188500	If they are happy in a job, they will be more productive and therefore will contribute more, not just to the business that they are involved in, but to the British economy in general.
188500	190500	Tuition fees do not provide that motivation.
190500	195000	It's just another stress put onto students' lives, and it's not even fucking value for money.
195000	197500	Most students get 8 to 13 hours contact time.
197500	203500	I've heard of students who pass their assessments from just doing the lessons online and not even attending the lectures.
203500	204500	It's madness.
204500	210000	It's financially irresponsible, and these thoughtless actions that have already caused many talented people to move abroad
210000	214500	are only going to cause more people to move abroad if they then consider to raise them even further.
214500	218000	It's reâ€”justâ€”it's just stupid. Just stop.
218000	221500	Stop. The time has come to stop these tuition fees.
221500	224500	They're not affordable, and they're not making enough money.
224500	228500	You can't just expect something to give you back money.
228500	231000	You can't just charge someone if they can't pay it.
231000	232000	It's a joke.
232000	235500	So, there are my thoughts on tuition fees.
235500	238500	As you can tell, I really fucking hate them.
238500	243500	I honestly can't think of a reason why they are good, and even if they did succeed in making the government more money,
243500	245500	which they don't,
245500	252500	it wouldn't be in the best interest of Parliament to use them to essentially just push away all these bright young talents.
252500	254500	I mean, it's rather stupid, really.
254500	256500	Wow. I was proper on one tonight.
256500	258500	I'm the right opinion.
258500	261000	And I'll see you in the next one.
261000	269000	ðŸŽµ
