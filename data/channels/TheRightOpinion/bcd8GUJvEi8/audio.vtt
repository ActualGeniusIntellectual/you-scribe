00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
One day, a 42-year-old adult comes along and says that while he was 10 years old,

00:05.360 --> 00:10.720
he had a perfectly consensual sexual relationship with a 30-year-old adult.

00:10.720 --> 00:17.200
The relationship was perfectly fine and consensual, and both of them enjoyed the sexual relationship.

00:18.000 --> 00:18.800
Are you alright, mate?

00:24.320 --> 00:28.160
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free

00:28.160 --> 00:34.480
time and Amos Yee, someone who was under the radar for a while. Yes, this man is apparently quite

00:34.480 --> 00:39.520
notorious. I noticed a few people saying that he was an advocate for pedophilia, and I, being my

00:39.520 --> 00:44.080
naive self, at first assumed it was some sort of soft-advocation, just the avocation of their

00:44.080 --> 00:51.840
existence or legitimization or something like that, and oh my, was I wrong. Yes, in a lovely

00:51.840 --> 00:56.560
video, quaintly named pedophilia is alright, he argues that not just pedophilia is alright,

00:56.560 --> 01:01.280
but the sexual encounters with children is fine as long as they consent. Now, a lot of people

01:01.280 --> 01:05.360
have been speaking about the general morality of the issue, which I'll definitely integrate,

01:05.360 --> 01:09.280
but I also like to try and bring a different spin on my channel, so I'll be looking to integrate

01:09.280 --> 01:14.800
more pragmatic points as well. Let us get right into the video, because I just cannot wait to

01:14.800 --> 01:21.040
taste the spiciness of his points. He begins with a very pleasant anecdote in his preamble, in which

01:21.040 --> 01:25.600
he presents the story of a 42-year-old man who reveals that he had a healthy sexual relationship

01:25.600 --> 01:30.800
when he was a child with a 30-year-old adult, and it was alright, because he personally was

01:30.800 --> 01:36.160
not traumatized as a child at all. So it's all good, happy days, who cares about anyone else?

01:36.160 --> 01:40.240
We have one counterexample and that's what matters. He then states that the treatment of

01:40.240 --> 01:45.520
pedophiles by society has been horrendous, saying that pedophilia is merely the attraction and not

01:45.520 --> 01:49.600
someone who is going to act on them, and following that statement by arguing that a pedophile should

01:49.600 --> 01:54.240
be allowed to act on those feelings anyway to a consenting child, so yeah, strange point.

01:54.240 --> 01:58.720
He also refers to pedophilia as a sexual orientation. It's not. In its most pragmatic

01:58.720 --> 02:02.400
terms, it's a preference. An inappropriate preference, but a preference nonetheless.

02:02.400 --> 02:06.720
If you're attracted to old people, for example, that's not an orientation. Let's get that clear.

02:06.720 --> 02:10.800
Once again, I cannot comment on the asserted solidified nature of pedophilia, but it is one

02:10.800 --> 02:14.880
of those things that is not right to be exposed to a child. Children are unique in that way. They're

02:14.880 --> 02:18.240
not the same as adults, they're old enough to understand, but they're young enough to still

02:18.240 --> 02:22.720
have it negatively influence their development. If you have a sexual attraction to children,

02:22.720 --> 02:25.680
so be it. But keep it to yourself, thanks. End of.

02:25.680 --> 02:29.760
I also don't appreciate that he's grouping pedophiles into the LGBT community. I'm

02:29.760 --> 02:35.040
putting my foot down here. Pedophilia is not a sexuality, okay? Sexuality for me is what

02:35.040 --> 02:40.000
sexual organs you enjoy. Dick or vag or both. Whatever floats your boat. Is that clear enough?

02:40.000 --> 02:44.400
He also carries on grouping pedophiles with genuine child molesters and asking why people

02:44.400 --> 02:48.080
believe they should be jailed. And once again, to clarify, you're only going to be jailed if

02:48.080 --> 02:53.920
you act on those urges. He also references statistics to do with suicide, listed as 30-150,

02:53.920 --> 02:58.240
which is so incredibly broad that it's hardly verifiable, and he doesn't even reference it

02:58.240 --> 03:03.360
below. So that's pretty useless, isn't it? He also uses the classic look at the terrible stigma

03:03.360 --> 03:07.200
these people are getting, so here's why we don't need age of consent. They're completely different

03:07.200 --> 03:10.640
and bizarre points, and the fact that he's trying to emote sympathy through telling people these

03:10.640 --> 03:14.800
horrible stories of electroshock therapy, and then to go on and say, but sexual encounters with

03:14.800 --> 03:18.960
children are right, must be intentionally missing the point. And I know this is split into different

03:18.960 --> 03:23.120
parts, but this whole section seems like a red herring and completely irrelevant to what he's

03:23.120 --> 03:28.160
trying to argue. And then he talks about child porn. Now I could go off on any one of these guys

03:28.160 --> 03:32.400
explaining how children are too young to consent, which I think is almost ubiquitously understood.

03:32.400 --> 03:36.960
I think it's kind of amusing and worrying at the same time how genuinely morally black and white

03:36.960 --> 03:41.280
he sees the idea of child consent. It is pretty black and white, just the other way around. I

03:41.280 --> 03:46.560
like how outraged he seems at the idea of child porn being punishable by 15 to 30 years in prison.

03:46.560 --> 03:51.200
Even if you were an advocate on such a matter, surely you could understand why people find it

03:51.200 --> 03:55.360
distinctly wrong. Ye seems genuinely annoyed and confused that people are in favour of such a

03:55.360 --> 03:59.680
punitive measure. With regard to child pornography, Amos Ye completely disregards previous comments

03:59.680 --> 04:03.840
about consenting and complains that possession of it should not be prosecutable by law, but his

04:03.840 --> 04:07.760
outrage is once again completely false, not to mention he misses the problem with child pornography

04:07.760 --> 04:12.400
possession completely. It's not about exposure. If people believe that a child is too young to

04:12.400 --> 04:16.800
consent, then all child pornography is illegal. An active possession of such is also illegal,

04:16.800 --> 04:21.280
not to mention morally obscene. It's trickle down criminality, as child pornography is a business

04:21.280 --> 04:25.280
in itself and there's no benefit of the doubt allowed with such. You cannot be possessing it

04:25.280 --> 04:29.760
because it is complicity in an illegal business. It's like owning a stolen car. It's not like

04:29.760 --> 04:35.200
watching footage of a robbery because specifically the footage is also illegal. Is that understood?

04:35.280 --> 04:40.000
That is not the same as any other criminality. There is no moral equivalence.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.920
Then he talks about age of consent and oh dear, no one's denying that there are some

04:43.920 --> 04:47.440
adolescents who are more mature than others, but the laws are in place because people have

04:47.440 --> 04:50.960
selected an age at which they have decided that children can have control of their own

04:50.960 --> 04:55.360
sexual prerogative. He argues for erasing the age of consent laws and then suggests that the idea

04:55.360 --> 04:59.280
of sending someone who has quote mutually beneficial sex with a nine year old to jail

04:59.280 --> 05:04.800
is insane. No, it's not. It's perfectly same, my friend. You have to understand this. The line

05:04.800 --> 05:09.280
is drawn for reasons, not just for individual comprehension. Children are precious in

05:09.280 --> 05:14.640
development and if you know by now, any adult sexual assault case is a very complicated case

05:14.640 --> 05:19.440
indeed and more often it will lead to moral gray areas where it's a plaintiff's word against a

05:19.440 --> 05:24.480
defendant. Can you imagine the danger of that with children? The age of consent laws are there

05:24.480 --> 05:28.960
not to make exceptions for that reason. You say that if it causes emotional trauma, then a

05:28.960 --> 05:32.960
paedophile could be prosecuted, but how would you plan on measuring and proving that in a court of

05:32.960 --> 05:37.760
law where child sex is legal? It would just be like any rape case. But in this instance,

05:37.760 --> 05:42.480
children could suffer a lot fucking more. The damage and the implication is unthinkable.

05:42.480 --> 05:47.040
You haven't even began to consider this world that you wish to live in and the amount of disastrous

05:47.040 --> 05:52.160
outcomes that can take place. Where the fuck is your manifesto? There is no need for sex at a

05:52.160 --> 05:57.040
young age and your proposed legislation would only help the sickest in society. And I don't need you

05:57.040 --> 06:01.200
to clarify in every video that you're not a paedophile. It kind of seems more suspicious

06:01.200 --> 06:04.880
when you feel the need to assert that. I'm sorry, I'm really having trouble finding the

06:04.880 --> 06:08.640
reasoning behind a lot of your assertions in this video and especially a lot of the comparisons

06:08.640 --> 06:13.040
that you make. The use of one example doesn't deny the overwhelming examples to the contrary

06:13.040 --> 06:17.120
and the laws are in place to protect children who aren't old enough to consent. With your ideas,

06:17.120 --> 06:21.360
you would only be graying the subject matter and facilitating illegal acts that would be much

06:21.360 --> 06:25.920
harder to drive consequences for. Morally and pragmatically, it's wrong. There's no excuse.

06:26.480 --> 06:33.680
Sort your shit out, mate. Please. Anyway, a bit of a longer video. Spicier video, I guess.

06:33.680 --> 06:38.480
I hope you enjoyed. It was certainly an interesting one. Any thoughts? Hopefully,

06:38.480 --> 06:42.480
this one will be a bit more unanimous, but you never know. Either way, I'm intrigued to hear.

06:42.480 --> 06:46.960
Until then, I'm The Right Opinion and I'll see you in the next one.
