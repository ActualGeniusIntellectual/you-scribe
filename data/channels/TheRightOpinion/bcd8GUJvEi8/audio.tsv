0	5360	One day, a 42-year-old adult comes along and says that while he was 10 years old,
5360	10720	he had a perfectly consensual sexual relationship with a 30-year-old adult.
10720	17200	The relationship was perfectly fine and consensual, and both of them enjoyed the sexual relationship.
18000	18800	Are you alright, mate?
24320	28160	Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free
28160	34480	time and Amos Yee, someone who was under the radar for a while. Yes, this man is apparently quite
34480	39520	notorious. I noticed a few people saying that he was an advocate for pedophilia, and I, being my
39520	44080	naive self, at first assumed it was some sort of soft-advocation, just the avocation of their
44080	51840	existence or legitimization or something like that, and oh my, was I wrong. Yes, in a lovely
51840	56560	video, quaintly named pedophilia is alright, he argues that not just pedophilia is alright,
56560	61280	but the sexual encounters with children is fine as long as they consent. Now, a lot of people
61280	65360	have been speaking about the general morality of the issue, which I'll definitely integrate,
65360	69280	but I also like to try and bring a different spin on my channel, so I'll be looking to integrate
69280	74800	more pragmatic points as well. Let us get right into the video, because I just cannot wait to
74800	81040	taste the spiciness of his points. He begins with a very pleasant anecdote in his preamble, in which
81040	85600	he presents the story of a 42-year-old man who reveals that he had a healthy sexual relationship
85600	90800	when he was a child with a 30-year-old adult, and it was alright, because he personally was
90800	96160	not traumatized as a child at all. So it's all good, happy days, who cares about anyone else?
96160	100240	We have one counterexample and that's what matters. He then states that the treatment of
100240	105520	pedophiles by society has been horrendous, saying that pedophilia is merely the attraction and not
105520	109600	someone who is going to act on them, and following that statement by arguing that a pedophile should
109600	114240	be allowed to act on those feelings anyway to a consenting child, so yeah, strange point.
114240	118720	He also refers to pedophilia as a sexual orientation. It's not. In its most pragmatic
118720	122400	terms, it's a preference. An inappropriate preference, but a preference nonetheless.
122400	126720	If you're attracted to old people, for example, that's not an orientation. Let's get that clear.
126720	130800	Once again, I cannot comment on the asserted solidified nature of pedophilia, but it is one
130800	134880	of those things that is not right to be exposed to a child. Children are unique in that way. They're
134880	138240	not the same as adults, they're old enough to understand, but they're young enough to still
138240	142720	have it negatively influence their development. If you have a sexual attraction to children,
142720	145680	so be it. But keep it to yourself, thanks. End of.
145680	149760	I also don't appreciate that he's grouping pedophiles into the LGBT community. I'm
149760	155040	putting my foot down here. Pedophilia is not a sexuality, okay? Sexuality for me is what
155040	160000	sexual organs you enjoy. Dick or vag or both. Whatever floats your boat. Is that clear enough?
160000	164400	He also carries on grouping pedophiles with genuine child molesters and asking why people
164400	168080	believe they should be jailed. And once again, to clarify, you're only going to be jailed if
168080	173920	you act on those urges. He also references statistics to do with suicide, listed as 30-150,
173920	178240	which is so incredibly broad that it's hardly verifiable, and he doesn't even reference it
178240	183360	below. So that's pretty useless, isn't it? He also uses the classic look at the terrible stigma
183360	187200	these people are getting, so here's why we don't need age of consent. They're completely different
187200	190640	and bizarre points, and the fact that he's trying to emote sympathy through telling people these
190640	194800	horrible stories of electroshock therapy, and then to go on and say, but sexual encounters with
194800	198960	children are right, must be intentionally missing the point. And I know this is split into different
198960	203120	parts, but this whole section seems like a red herring and completely irrelevant to what he's
203120	208160	trying to argue. And then he talks about child porn. Now I could go off on any one of these guys
208160	212400	explaining how children are too young to consent, which I think is almost ubiquitously understood.
212400	216960	I think it's kind of amusing and worrying at the same time how genuinely morally black and white
216960	221280	he sees the idea of child consent. It is pretty black and white, just the other way around. I
221280	226560	like how outraged he seems at the idea of child porn being punishable by 15 to 30 years in prison.
226560	231200	Even if you were an advocate on such a matter, surely you could understand why people find it
231200	235360	distinctly wrong. Ye seems genuinely annoyed and confused that people are in favour of such a
235360	239680	punitive measure. With regard to child pornography, Amos Ye completely disregards previous comments
239680	243840	about consenting and complains that possession of it should not be prosecutable by law, but his
243840	247760	outrage is once again completely false, not to mention he misses the problem with child pornography
247760	252400	possession completely. It's not about exposure. If people believe that a child is too young to
252400	256800	consent, then all child pornography is illegal. An active possession of such is also illegal,
256800	261280	not to mention morally obscene. It's trickle down criminality, as child pornography is a business
261280	265280	in itself and there's no benefit of the doubt allowed with such. You cannot be possessing it
265280	269760	because it is complicity in an illegal business. It's like owning a stolen car. It's not like
269760	275200	watching footage of a robbery because specifically the footage is also illegal. Is that understood?
275280	280000	That is not the same as any other criminality. There is no moral equivalence.
280000	283920	Then he talks about age of consent and oh dear, no one's denying that there are some
283920	287440	adolescents who are more mature than others, but the laws are in place because people have
287440	290960	selected an age at which they have decided that children can have control of their own
290960	295360	sexual prerogative. He argues for erasing the age of consent laws and then suggests that the idea
295360	299280	of sending someone who has quote mutually beneficial sex with a nine year old to jail
299280	304800	is insane. No, it's not. It's perfectly same, my friend. You have to understand this. The line
304800	309280	is drawn for reasons, not just for individual comprehension. Children are precious in
309280	314640	development and if you know by now, any adult sexual assault case is a very complicated case
314640	319440	indeed and more often it will lead to moral gray areas where it's a plaintiff's word against a
319440	324480	defendant. Can you imagine the danger of that with children? The age of consent laws are there
324480	328960	not to make exceptions for that reason. You say that if it causes emotional trauma, then a
328960	332960	paedophile could be prosecuted, but how would you plan on measuring and proving that in a court of
332960	337760	law where child sex is legal? It would just be like any rape case. But in this instance,
337760	342480	children could suffer a lot fucking more. The damage and the implication is unthinkable.
342480	347040	You haven't even began to consider this world that you wish to live in and the amount of disastrous
347040	352160	outcomes that can take place. Where the fuck is your manifesto? There is no need for sex at a
352160	357040	young age and your proposed legislation would only help the sickest in society. And I don't need you
357040	361200	to clarify in every video that you're not a paedophile. It kind of seems more suspicious
361200	364880	when you feel the need to assert that. I'm sorry, I'm really having trouble finding the
364880	368640	reasoning behind a lot of your assertions in this video and especially a lot of the comparisons
368640	373040	that you make. The use of one example doesn't deny the overwhelming examples to the contrary
373040	377120	and the laws are in place to protect children who aren't old enough to consent. With your ideas,
377120	381360	you would only be graying the subject matter and facilitating illegal acts that would be much
381360	385920	harder to drive consequences for. Morally and pragmatically, it's wrong. There's no excuse.
386480	393680	Sort your shit out, mate. Please. Anyway, a bit of a longer video. Spicier video, I guess.
393680	398480	I hope you enjoyed. It was certainly an interesting one. Any thoughts? Hopefully,
398480	402480	this one will be a bit more unanimous, but you never know. Either way, I'm intrigued to hear.
402480	406960	Until then, I'm The Right Opinion and I'll see you in the next one.
