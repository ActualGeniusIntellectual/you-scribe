1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,320
What if the world you knew wasn't as it was?

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:29,000
What if all the people, the names, the faces, the emotions, were not real?

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What if your idols were just blueprints?

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:24,840
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

5
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,840
too much free time.

6
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,600
And something told me this had to be done, today we talk about story time, animators.

7
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,640
And it came from an interesting source, you see I have goodfellas who's content I support

8
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,760
and so I'm going to drop it a view and send them some constructive feedback.

9
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,440
The video I decided to check out on the 17th of August 2018, was Turkey Tom's video

10
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,600
on animators.

11
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,960
It was a fine enough video, there was definitely insight and information revealed, and I'll

12
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,080
leave it in the description below if you want to go and see it for yourself.

13
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,640
However there was one comment that specifically caught my attention, and it's a passing

14
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:13,520
one really.

15
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,120
Yes an aside comment about the personas adopted by story time animators, admittedly a genre

16
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,600
that I don't have that much interest in, gave me a simple lightbulb moment.

17
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,840
What is that lightbulb moment?

18
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,800
Well you'll have to be patient, because right now we're going to provide a little

19
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,460
synopsis of what the animation community is, because I'm sure many of you may be unfamiliar

20
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,520
with this swelling group of creators.

21
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,240
To understand the evolution we need to go back a few years, because there was a time

22
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:43,000
when animation was all over YouTube, it was inescapable, a range of unique creators converging

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,600
in this place that supported their individuality, YouTube was almost custom made for it, the

24
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,800
idea that people were expressing themselves, that's what YouTube was all about, and

25
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,720
their effort was being rewarded in one of the most fulfilling ways possible.

26
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,040
In the early days, animators focused mainly on a distinct style to find themselves, in

27
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,840
a video reflecting on this, Quinton reviews depicted the intricate style that each of

28
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,840
them took.

29
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,040
I won't repeat what he said, but in the early days of YouTube there were many creators

30
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,800
who really set themselves apart using information, and you know what, I liked it a lot.

31
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,700
Even though it wasn't as direct and to the point as many other videos, you could see

32
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,980
what was being expressed through the cartoons, personally I'm a big fan of show not tell

33
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,240
storytelling, and even if the stuff seems shallow on the surface, when you broke a lot

34
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,620
of it down, it seemed to reveal interesting layers, and that stuff really rocked the boat

35
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,400
of YouTube.

36
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,740
But then, it just stopped.

37
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,780
I'm sure many of you will know the story, but to those who don't, YouTube run a range

38
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,260
of algorithms that decide whether a genre lives or dies, and whether they decide it

39
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,300
wasn't profitable enough, or just the views began to dip a tad, YouTube decide to pull

40
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,820
the plug, and these animators were left in the dark.

41
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:54,100
Many moons passed and the sun seemed set on those in the animation genre, no gaps really

42
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,200
opened up, YouTube felt like a different place than therefore was documented by many, however

43
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,580
by 2016 there was a new gap in the market.

44
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,660
2016 was an interesting year, not just for YouTube but for people, we were moving into

45
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,140
a more volatile area, there was an era of cynicism, but one thing I'd say in particular

46
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,620
was that people were becoming more aware, aware of the world around them, aware of the

47
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,820
tactics being used by people who were previously trusted, people no longer sought after those

48
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,560
who pandered to their sympathies, it was a real shift in mentality across the spectrum,

49
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,860
and that awareness of the world around them led to an equally increased awareness of self.

50
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,100
It led to a more brooding generation, a set of people looking more inside themselves rather

51
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,460
than looking for exterior validation from the previous set of superficial creators,

52
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,440
and through this rose a very interesting genre known as storytime animation.

53
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,060
Most people here will probably know the odd ones out who was one of the real pioneers

54
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,480
of the genre, at the turn of 2016 he had little more than 10,000 subscribers, yet by

55
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,260
the end he had over 2 million.

56
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,260
Why though?

57
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,700
Well his content reflected the landscape that I just described you, when looking inside

58
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,140
themselves people found insecurities, things that they wanted to change, and no longer

59
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,180
did they look to these fake smiley vloggers, just gloss over it and show the nice bright

60
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,060
side of everything, they wanted people who would put in that sort of self reflection

61
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,340
into their content.

62
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,740
Now it's not like the vloggers and other content didn't try to put deep moments in

63
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,900
their videos but it was almost always given a contrived gloss or stuck at the end of a

64
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,300
video in which they went out and bought a new Bentley for their second cousin.

65
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,340
It was hard to relate to struggles, that's what I'm saying, particularly when they

66
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,500
were presented in a way that we didn't see them inside ourselves, however by reflecting

67
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,340
on the past the odd ones out tapped into an authenticity, whereas the former class of

68
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,120
vloggers took general struggles and made them personalised, the odd ones out reversed that

69
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,000
formula and took the humdrum of everyday life and presented them in a light that made people

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,440
think this guy gets me, he took his own individual situations and tinted them in a timeless sentiment

71
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,960
that appealed to the current generation of our introspective youth, I respect him for

72
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
that.

73
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,280
As I've said before I went to VidCon 2018 this year, it gave me lots of individual epiphanies,

74
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,720
moments that just stuck out in my head, one of those was the moment when I was passing

75
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,600
through the merch stands and I remember feeling kinda weird when I saw the merchandising for

76
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,100
Jaiden animations and the odd ones out, just a discomfort.

77
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,060
My logic soon kicked in overriding this gut instinct, at the end of the day, anyone who

78
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,140
has that following should be completely allowed to sell merch, after all, their fans want

79
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,260
to support it too, but it did make me wonder, when something like their content, content

80
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:21,260
that seems so wholesome and grassroots in their appeal, that speaks to people as sometimes

81
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,840
their most vulnerable, could be taken advantage of and transformed into a cash cow, how long

82
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,360
is it until the wrong sort of people try to jump on the bandwagon?

83
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,560
And that brings us back to our quote, today we will discuss a plethora of questions, why

84
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,160
the animation community is unique in a way, but at the same time how that could both damage

85
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,800
their reputation and make them susceptible to criticism, the problems with their often

86
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,680
dismissive and passive aggressive responses to their critics, and how that for many viewers

87
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,260
foreshadows a worrisome trend noticed in many YouTube genres before it, and perhaps leading

88
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,880
them to the same fate.

89
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,120
So without further ado, I suggest we cut into this spicy piece, let's get to it.

90
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,640
Lack of authenticity has been a problem endemic to YouTube, what is remotely different about

91
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,120
this situation?

92
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,100
Well let's explain that, you see content creators like vloggers may have been disingenuous,

93
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,760
in fact fuck it of course they were disingenuous, but they seldom sold it as anything else,

94
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,420
everyone knew that it wasn't exactly them, and when they did it, it wasn't the crux

95
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:30,340
of their channel, it wasn't the core appeal, it was just an outlet to their forever dramatising

96
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,420
forced personality, which I have laid into multiple times at this point.

97
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,620
However with these story time animators, it is them, this is who they are, and the struggles

98
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,020
influence their character and the interaction they have with their followers, and that's

99
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,980
important it's not something you should take advantage of, equally it means that in

100
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,220
the genre they set the bar incredibly high for conduct, they can't behave like Joey

101
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,980
Salads because they present themselves as better, and you can tell that they believe

102
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,980
it.

103
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,660
So why are we still talking about the way they respond to criticism, and why does it

104
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,660
matter?

105
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,700
When documenting the original set of animators, Quinton reviews really showed how each of

106
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,380
these individuals had their own personality, channeled through their art, and the beauty

107
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,500
that it really created, and so when the clip that we observed in the Turkey Tom video was

108
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,900
played, it sent up some red flags, how can you summarise a premise of a genre in one

109
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,900
sentence?

110
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,740
The reason I left out the whole sentiment of his video, whether proven or not, was that

111
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,660
there were creators out there who had real trouble taking criticism.

112
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,240
Now obviously it depends on how that criticism is delivered, you're not going to engage

113
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,300
in someone who's rude or attempts to snidely undermine you, however given the behaviour

114
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,340
of some of these animators, when someone makes fairly passable comments, and you react with

115
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,420
great volatility, then it could be a sign of insecurity, I know commentators who are

116
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:41,540
very aware that the current content they're creating is some part of their ability, it

117
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:48,120
is written all over their attitude, and I've read it.

118
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,700
Now insecurity isn't always a sign of mal-intent, someone may just be socially anxious, however

119
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,540
it is definitely cause for further investigation, and that's what we're going to be doing

120
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,540
today.

121
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,900
It's also important to note that another YouTuber, Darth Pinya, has done multiple videos

122
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,740
covering the individual YouTubers, and I would definitely recommend checking out some of

123
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,540
his videos, however today we may use certain individual YouTubers as exemplars, but the

124
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,540
greater point will be made discussing the culture that surrounds the genre, and why

125
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,060
surface value innocence is lined with a sharp poison.

126
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:22,580
For storytime animators, people wanted to move away from the inauthentic superficiality,

127
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,320
so we looked for people to fill in the void of these new characters, characters that we

128
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,240
assessed as deeper, but if the trials and tribulations of these individuals are being

129
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,500
summed up so succinctly, then we might have a new problem on our hands, but at least let's

130
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,060
try to break the formula down into a few more sentences, and work out where the leverage

131
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,060
is being operated.

132
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,300
Now you must understand that due to my status as a prominent cynic, that I went into these

133
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,700
videos expecting to detest most to all of them, nonetheless I watched the old ones out

134
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,620
and came to the realisation that his content was actually pretty great, not anything necessarily

135
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,180
that I would watch, just not really my style, but he was a pretty compelling creator, sometimes

136
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,860
the pioneer of a genre is retrospectively seen as actually a pretty average creator

137
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:08,700
who just struck gold with the topics, think Trigga Tro, Leafy and so on, not saying they're

138
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,380
bad exactly, but it's clear that there were better creators who knew how to utilise

139
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,860
their topics with more panache, however James here clearly actually has raw talent that

140
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,820
extends beyond the base formula, and so I was pleasantly surprised, his story said more

141
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,940
about himself than he needed to say explicitly, show not tell, he's mastered it, so props

142
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,060
to him for doing that, however I did not expect him to be the target of this video because

143
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,160
he was doing it before it was popular, and that's something that no uninspired leech

144
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,360
would ever do.

145
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,600
So from the old ones out, it inevitably seemed like it was going to go downhill, it wasn't

146
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,560
necessarily a sharp drop in quality though, there were just certain cracks that became

147
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,520
noticeable, that sent off signals that didn't endear me as a viewer, alongside watching

148
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,480
their content I watched Da Pinya's videos about the creators, not just as a monitor

149
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,880
to make sure I didn't miss anything, but also to see how they had responded, that can

150
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,960
be equally as revealing as the content itself, but let's talk about the appeal of the content.

151
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,120
I've spoken about this earlier, but a word I'm using a lot is authenticity, I think

152
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,880
it's safe to say that it is one of the key hooks of the storytime animator, these

153
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,640
people are living life, therefore there are two components that are central to these characters,

154
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,760
honesty and entertainment, if either of these were compromised the fans would be unlikely

155
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,440
to support the creator, what I like about the old ones out is that he manages to make

156
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,520
the mundane details interesting, and this is why in my opinion, he'll always be the

157
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
most successful.

158
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,560
This is not to say that no other individuals in this genre have the capability to be interesting,

159
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,180
they're actually completely the opposite, however their personalities in particular

160
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,920
and sometimes their humour seem to lack a pizzazz, in fact if you just stripped them

161
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,560
down to the core personality many of them wouldn't be interesting at all, so how do

162
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,900
you circumvent that?

163
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:50,020
What I found for many of these creators who may not be so recognisable on the personality

164
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:54,880
area was that they often used dramatised source material, dramatised source material isn't

165
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,000
a bad thing necessarily, though it gives the actual storyteller less work, coasting on

166
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,920
the crazy plot and clickbait titles.

167
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,920
Why is that?

168
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,280
Well you can't be boring while presenting it as entertaining, because at that point

169
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,920
it just becomes entertaining, but you can be dishonest while presenting it as honest,

170
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,060
you can't really answer the question of whether these things happened or not, nor

171
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,560
can you pick out specific events, but eventually with the clickbait and the sort of embellishment

172
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,360
that I observed, I began to feel like some of the videos were just Tarnamon Goose on

173
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,320
paper, just with a bit more personality, which is obviously welcome, but it's not impossible

174
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,360
to tell stories, so I don't really rate that alone, once again you can't prove it

175
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,080
as fake, but it's understandable to be sceptical of the idea that all of these people

176
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,440
with such a backlog of interesting stories remembered so well in their memory, down to

177
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,000
specific details have all converged in one community, hella fucking coincidence.

178
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,040
And in fact if you don't want me to spell it out to you, TerryTV Will, another youtuber

179
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,200
reached out to me saying he made a video on him that hadn't even accumulated 100 views

180
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,200
when good old Terry went on his little diatribe, for the record TerryTV is a trend hopper creator

181
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,480
who recently decided to jack storytime animation, and use the fact that he had mentioned that

182
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,760
his series were exaggerated as a defence for exaggerating, fair point of course, until

183
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,120
you dig further and realise that he only announced it was exaggerated in the last two minutes

184
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,360
of the final video of the series, after an unofficial outro.

185
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,080
I know a lot of you guys have been asking in the comments if these stories are true,

186
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:27,640
the answer is yes, to an extent, they are based off of my life, but as some of you guessed

187
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,200
in the comments, yes, some things that happened in the story were exaggerated a little bit

188
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,680
just for comedic effect, or just to make the story a little more interesting.

189
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,600
And after, he'd accumulated over 2 million views, kinda like me conducting a series of

190
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,380
pranks and then declaring them fake in my final video after reaping the sweet ad revenue.

191
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,320
He said he wanted to address the claims, but I wonder why he didn't address them at the

192
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,400
end of the second video at least.

193
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,600
In fact, TerryTV seems quite sure that he made it so obvious that it was exaggerated,

194
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,680
which does make me wonder why he even cares about someone calling him out for it.

195
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,040
It's Hollywood guys, storytime animators are Hollywood, put that quote on a wall lads,

196
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,120
I'm sure that's exactly what people like the odd ones out want to hear.

197
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,520
Now make no mistake, TerryTV is a trend hopper, and his movement to animation is the perfect

198
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,480
embodiment of what we're going to be talking about today.

199
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,640
In a recent video, Darkpina very briefly showed that somehow a YouTuber had managed to expose

200
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,740
himself as faking his stories, as this guy who had two accounts, Fox Goodman and Matt

201
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,160
Spicer had released two videos on the same subject, both telling different stories.

202
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,120
The fact that in a discrete environment, someone has nonetheless managed to show themselves

203
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,600
as falsifying stories should say how easy it actually is.

204
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,560
The problem is beyond the concept and combination of animation, the content exists on a spectrum,

205
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,040
it's easy to see the difference between the best and worst creators.

206
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,680
This is fine, in fact, clip baiting, telling exaggerated stories, having lower quality

207
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,280
and even being emotionally manipulative in certain scenarios is not unreasonable, if

208
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,740
you are fairly lazy with your animations and it attains views then more power to you.

209
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,520
The point is that no genre is truly above criticism, you do not have the sole ability

210
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,360
to be better by any excuse, but the problem is that they seem to adopt this holier-than-thou

211
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,600
attitude when responding to criticism, because there are people who will take problems with

212
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,920
all of the things that I've just listed, and that's the simple fact of the moral

213
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,620
compass, some people view things as acceptable, other people don't.

214
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,060
What matters to the viewer, is consistency.

215
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:24,380
One of the points that I saw made from time to time was that because animation videos

216
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:30,340
as a basis take more effort than per se, Fortnite videos, thanks James, that you cannot call

217
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:35,140
animation lazy, because there are other genres of video that take less effort at their best

218
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,580
than animation at their worst.

219
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:42,080
Though James my friend, that is just subjective commentary, individuals are compared to others

220
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,320
within their own genre, because that's where the appeal lies, however under the precipice

221
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,200
of content superiority, this bizarre standard has been adopted.

222
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,880
Let me ask you this, is Beethoven's 5th better than Lose Yourself because it took

223
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,680
longer or more effort?

224
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,280
Does it not want criticism?

225
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,940
No, because an unbelievably high amount of effort is assumed in the premise of the former,

226
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,920
it does not push the genre of orchestral symphonies above criticism.

227
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,740
You can defend a genre from criticism on its own, you can defend an individual creator

228
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,600
from criticism on its own, but to use a genre to create an umbrella defense for all its

229
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,260
animators is a fallacy of division, assuming all components are good because the greater

230
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,840
product is good.

231
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,220
This partly explains why until the last month, storytime animators seldom receive the same

232
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,760
level of scrutiny as other communities, but there's also more to say about that.

233
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,820
With storytime animators, everything is drenched in a level of emotional depth that makes it

234
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:39,120
hard to criticise, everyone seems more wholesome, if you criticise them, you're criticising

235
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,320
a character that has developed more intricate relationships with the audiences, and you

236
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,440
do feel bad for criticising that.

237
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,500
However, regardless of the level of effort in videos, every creator should be open to

238
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:56,680
some level of criticism, no matter how fantastic their character is, talking down their content

239
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,100
or argumentative points is never off the table.

240
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,140
In case it hasn't been discussed enough already, some of these creators do not like

241
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,760
receiving criticism themselves, in fact their response in certain instances has been bemusing,

242
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,100
whether it was dismissing it as subjective commentary, blocking individuals, or downloading

243
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:24,360
a video so as to not give a creator the views, that last one is truly hilarious because of

244
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,720
the effort it requires.

245
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,840
None of my points previous are trying to show the animators as quote bad human beings, however

246
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,320
the self-appointed sanctity that they give themselves is rather unfounded, as undoubtedly

247
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,800
many of them participate in the same behaviours that any other non-animation YouTube genre

248
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,440
has profited from, if someone chooses to criticise them for that, the fact that its animation

249
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,960
doesn't absolve them.

250
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,380
The reason why some of them do have trouble responding to criticism is something known

251
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,760
as the good guy complex, the fact that whether these people are good or bad within the community,

252
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,920
they have developed such an idea focused around being the protagonist, the criticism against

253
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,320
them is seen as unjustified because of their greater morality.

254
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,200
This is something we have encountered constantly on numerous occasions, from Greg Paul to Fouseytube,

255
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,240
the idea that there is a greater good that justifies the little mishaps.

256
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,560
Although their attitude is harder to point out as they don't explicitly say it, often

257
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,240
it's just little side references where you know you've gotten under their skin.

258
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,200
Most of these demonstrate animators setting up strawmen over how their criticism is delivered

259
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,400
and then telling their fans that these ridiculous ideas are not worth engaging with, while implying

260
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,040
some generality in the idea of these critics.

261
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:58,000
Probably one of the best examples of this was when something else YT made a video titled

262
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:06,240
Ripoffs, in which he decided to define ripoffs before explaining why he couldn't be his

263
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:16,640
own definition of ripoff, which yes, he's not directly copying or plagiarising, but

264
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,840
I feel those claiming he was a quote ripoff were referring to the second definition in

265
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:29,360
the dictionary, you know the inferior imitation one, and although you may be past that stage,

266
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,120
I understand what people were saying.

267
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,120
He then goes on to say that no one owns a style, and although true in this situation

268
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,640
it doesn't really contradict the idea of ripoffs existing, no one was trying to sue

269
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,640
you.

270
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,160
He then follows this by saying that because Let's Play YouTubers regularly play the same

271
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,400
game and have the same style of editing and are not considered ripoffs, he can't be considered

272
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,080
a ripoff either.

273
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:57,600
So let me rephrase this logical fallacy for everyone to understand how ridiculous it is.

274
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:03,100
Because one artist draws with a pencil and another artist draws with a pencil and neither

275
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:08,460
are ripping off each other, then if one artist's style resembles the other, then that cannot

276
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,940
be a ripoff either.

277
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,280
Sounds a bit silly now, doesn't it?

278
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:20,540
On top of that he said, in fact it's all fine because he has a different personality.

279
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:25,380
Suddenly to this creator, design seems much less a factor, but he seems more offended

280
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,540
at the idea that people were judging him above all, however the tone of the specific video

281
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:37,360
is what caught my attention.

282
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,420
One of enlightenment, there are a lot of stupid people in this world and something else YT

283
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:48,180
here is going to sit you all down and provide you with an education free of charge.

284
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,420
How kind.

285
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:54,740
He is an animator, and because he is an animator and he doesn't directly copy, then to call

286
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,500
him a ripoff is the most audacious thing you could do.

287
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,700
What I'm trying to say is that many of these creators almost seem offended at the idea

288
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,160
that they could be perceived as anything else than what they want their audience to see

289
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,300
them as, even when it's trivial things like ripoffs.

290
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:16,020
Some may argue that there is no credible argument against such things like clickbait or faking

291
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:21,020
and exaggerating stories and even ripping off when it's commonplace on YouTube.

292
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,020
Let me tell you, I've come across a few right opinion clones in my time, although not an

293
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,780
unreasonable argument, I think the fact that storytime YouTubers base their appeal and

294
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:33,020
build relationships, and subsequently profit off the trust and authenticity that their

295
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:38,380
content pervades, does mean that if a commentator wants to contradict that, to show up an element

296
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:43,140
that their audience may not have seen before, that may alter their perception, then they

297
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,160
equally have a right to do so.

298
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:50,540
And if the animators want to act holier than thou, then they're going to be held to holier

299
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,420
than thou standards.

300
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,500
They did this to themselves.

301
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:59,420
And judging by the little things, when researching through Da Pinya's videos, it's clear that

302
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:04,500
a few of them have felt guilty about things they've done, one of the minor very telling

303
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:10,740
changes was the removal of the featuring odd ones out credit on Tim Toms video title, which

304
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,140
blew him up.

305
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:17,180
After all, putting features when they barely feature is seen by some as marginally objectionable,

306
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:21,300
and given how sometimes they've complained about it, I understand why.

307
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:26,980
However, you cannot deny the past, it still happened, and you still did it that way.

308
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,640
If you think that might contradict your image, well, you should have thought about that before.

309
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,140
The problem is, with their success, there are always people looking to profit off it

310
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,320
without the same heart, without the same intentions as you, the good guy.

311
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,300
And even as the good guy, you might make mistakes.

312
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,620
It doesn't mean just because you're a good guy that you shouldn't be held to account

313
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,620
on them.

314
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:49,380
Almost every community is one that will have good creators and bad creators, good people

315
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,380
and bad people.

316
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,420
A clip from Tim Toms shows him expressing how everyone in the animation community is

317
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,660
just so wonderful.

318
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:02,140
You see in online communities, there's a lot of vitriol, a lot of anger, a lot of hatred.

319
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:07,840
And what I've found with the animation community on YouTube is that that couldn't be farther

320
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,840
from the truth.

321
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,940
But I don't agree with that, though I do understand why he perceives it that way.

322
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,660
The problem with the animation community is that the stock persona is inherently good,

323
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:22,500
deep and likeable, and the little exaggerations are very subtle, so it becomes impossible

324
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,820
to distinguish between those who are positive givers and helpful people, and those who are

325
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,740
sucking out the energy of the community, those who may be participating in disingenuous practices,

326
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,900
or those who are taking advantage of the kindness of others.

327
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,900
It all becomes indistinguishable, which is rather dangerous for a community, because

328
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,900
as a creator or as a viewer, you no longer know who to truly trust, you either put your

329
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,000
faith in everyone, or you play your cards very carefully.

330
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,200
Without catering to too many memes, there's this great Ted Talk, which discusses the concept

331
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,840
of givers and takers, I'll leave it in the pinned comment though it may be among other

332
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,400
links so you might have to control efforts, type in Ted or something.

333
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,800
But obviously takers are people who always contribute the least while wanting to take

334
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,640
the most, and there are also those who cater into the agreeable and disagreeable factions.

335
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,320
The problem is the existence of agreeable takers, those who behave nicely while still

336
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
taking advantage of others around them.

337
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,600
To be successful in the animation community, your persona has to be inherently agreeable,

338
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,340
so regardless of if you're a giver, taker, or a matcher, people cannot tell the difference.

339
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,280
To suggest that through chance there has been this utopian community created where everyone

340
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:31,640
who tries for success are just fantastic human beings, to me, and probably to many others,

341
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,920
would be delusional, and it's only a matter of time until the leeches begin to pile on.

342
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,880
And this is where everything comes full circle, because where there is success, there is a

343
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
formula.

344
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,040
There is the community circle, people want something more original, more organic, however

345
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,360
as soon as people realise the opportunity, and as soon as the formula became clearer,

346
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:55,240
and use that nature to create personas, that wholesome appeal will be undermined, and the

347
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,580
flaws will start to show, even for the best.

348
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,560
Eventually it's only a matter of time until people start to point out the flaws, that

349
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,120
something's polluted and you can't run away from it, the problem is that publicly, it's

350
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,920
very difficult to tell who's real and who's fake, but it won't stop people from trying,

351
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,120
and so when responding to this, they have to keep this in mind, that the person who's

352
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,320
criticised them may make some very compelling points.

353
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:24,960
However, in this instance behind the agreeable facade lies a much more chronic problem.

354
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:35,160
So recently, in spite of the absence of abhorrent scandals, they still have been receiving a

355
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,240
significant amount of criticism.

356
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,240
Why is that?

357
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,280
They do seem to have the belief that they know their community better than me, which

358
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,400
is probably true, but I know human nature better than them.

359
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,840
You see, I've watched a lot of videos and seen a lot of legitimate criticism levelled

360
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,480
against these creators, and I've levelled a lot of criticism which I think is fair,

361
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,800
not just current but speculative, but I don't think they'll be acknowledged because of their

362
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,160
nature to respond in an interesting manner.

363
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,640
We're going to fall back to the Something Else YT video.

364
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,600
So I left this final part out of his response to the allegations against him that he was

365
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,120
a rip-off because they're most relevant here.

366
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,800
Basically, he not only says himself, but he features Jayden Animations, another YouTuber,

367
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,660
to say he's not ripping off anyone and they don't mind because they're there to help each

368
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,660
other out.

369
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:22,000
So writing mean comments calling people rip-offs is not helpful at all to the community.

370
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,320
The greater good.

371
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,720
And this is a problem, the storytime animation community sees themselves as one huge collective

372
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,040
as they all note on multiple occasions stepping on each other's toes would be disastrous for

373
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:38,540
the algorithm, or THE ALGORITHM as some like to brand it, so it only makes sense that they

374
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,840
help each other out.

375
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,120
On top of this it means defending each other which is something that they have done on

376
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,840
multiple occasions, they all seem to be in a consensual business friendship with each

377
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,120
other, if someone's leeching a bit then that's alright because even if they do it helps everyone

378
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,600
out, using tags for views, sure, go for it.

379
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,920
That's all good but you can't be surprised if someone calls you out for it, and saying

380
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,980
that it's all alright because everyone in the specific context was fine with it just

381
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,740
won't wash with many people, why is that?

382
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:09,680
Because it doesn't contradict a greater narrative that may be implied about their character,

383
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,600
and that's why the criticism against animation has been slowly grown, because in spite of

384
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,520
their half responses they never work out how to actually contradict the narrative.

385
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,320
Sometimes if you consent to something that could be perceived as bad, instead of cancelling

386
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,760
the narrative it actually just extends to you as well, though it depends on the context

387
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,760
of course.

388
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,520
Jaden is perfectly embodied in Darth Pinya's content, a lot of his previous videos never

389
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,520
gained much traction, because although his greater narrative contradicted the image that

390
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,120
the storytime animation community tried to emulate, he never successfully disproved it,

391
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,840
and in some instances he even received quite severe criticism such as his video on Jaden

392
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,760
Animations, a video which I feel was quite misguided in its points.

393
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,320
However with the recent drama slowly escalating, harsher criticism and more intense videos

394
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,040
documenting more universally agreed wrongdoings such as tracing, neglect of credit to artists

395
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:11,600
and just complete deflection of criticism on the back of simply awful reasoning, people's

396
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,960
minds will slowly be changed, and every single one of his videos on that topic has slowly

397
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,680
gained more credibility, and people will begin to doubt the rhetoric espoused by many others

398
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,360
in defence of these creators.

399
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,880
The reason is because the idea of just permitting it within the community exists beyond an inner

400
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,760
circle, people begin to see how if kept up this could create disingenuous characters

401
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,720
who not just exploit those within their circle but those outside, artists, fans and so on,

402
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,600
it's probably happened already.

403
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,000
People don't like the idea of that, people don't like the thought that they'd be

404
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,880
contributing to something like that, even if everyone in that specific scenario is in

405
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,880
support of it.

406
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,280
If I gave someone permission to stab me, and they stab me, would it necessarily absolve

407
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,280
them?

408
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:57,280
If anyone here has watched Hot Fuzz I compare the animation community to Sandford, the sort

409
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,520
of place that works so hard to keep a lovely image that it requires questionable action

410
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,640
sometimes to preserve it, and they can feel the pressure and the harder they try to defend

411
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,560
it the more I feel they have something to hide, and the more the cracks begin to show.

412
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,560
A really interesting example of this was when a YouTuber by the name of MangaKamen made

413
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,640
a response to Turkey Tom, the video was fair in many points, and it also brought up some

414
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,960
tweets that Tom had subsequently deleted that would have given more context to his video.

415
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,440
They were distasteful comments directed at someone's physical appearance, I am glad

416
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,240
he removed them, and subsequently was made to apologise over them, people shouldn't

417
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,240
just run away from these, and although I do have problems with the video I am almost certain

418
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,440
they will be mostly discussed out by other YouTubers at this point, including Tom himself.

419
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,560
Point is, his tweets were something that should have been included as a disclaimer given its

420
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,680
relevance, and as he hadn't publicly apologised for them it is credible that it served as

421
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,800
an alternative explanation for a server ban, and on top of that it looked like he was being

422
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,480
a dick in a public Discord server, I might have banned him too.

423
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,640
However no, what I found most interesting was the odd ones out's response in the comment

424
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,640
section.

425
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,960
Wow, I had no idea the stuff on Twitter happened, thanks for showing us, really makes me wonder

426
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,200
why Tom left it out of his video, I've been binging your videos for a while, I think they

427
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,320
are really good, I like that you have actual criticisms and bring up new things to the

428
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,320
conversation.

429
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,480
Well, James you're gonna love this next part.

430
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,360
I have sung my praises for the man, and his content, but this is where it ends for now.

431
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,400
James has no love for Tom and to be honest, if I were in his shoes I probably wouldn't

432
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,400
either.

433
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,520
But I don't like these comments, they're what I like to call an empty lead, it's a classic

434
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,680
rhetorical tactic used by people when they want to take credibility from their detractors

435
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,940
without giving them any way to respond to them, they firstly blow up whatever information

436
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:45,760
or react in an emphatic manner, saying something like wow, amazing, and then imply that something

437
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,600
worse must be behind it without explicitly saying what you're thinking.

438
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,760
Like what on earth do you mean makes you wonder, Cayman here just spent a whole fucking video

439
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,020
explaining it.

440
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,380
This is the most that James can really exert influence, any greater acknowledgement of

441
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,980
Turkey Tom would just be publicity for him, but my god does he try hard with everything

442
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,980
he has.

443
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:08,020
So I said to Tom in a group chat that it was a fair video on him, but what was with the

444
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,940
old ones out comments, and boy, there was more.

445
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,660
The old ones out had actually approached Tom and given him a whole lecture about the situation

446
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:19,880
and how the tweets, the specific tweets, had ruined his reputation, and could follow him

447
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,080
forever.

448
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:32,680
No, that's what you wanted to do.

449
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,140
It only vaguely compromised the points he made about the Discord server, everything

450
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,700
else was presented in videos before anyway.

451
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,160
And yes, as a joke it was poor form, but you're setting the bar pretty low if you believe

452
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:48,200
those sorts of jokes ruin reputations, considering it has been fairly prevalent in many YouTubers,

453
00:31:48,200 --> 00:32:15,240
whether funny, or unfunny.

454
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,560
And yes, he was specifically referring to the tweets to see the question, now James

455
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:31,040
isn't stupid, and he knows that his mates have derided people's images in the past,

456
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,120
and that although the targeted nature in this instance definitely makes it worse, it's

457
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,120
not career ending.

458
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,800
So why on earth would he make such a song and dance about it?

459
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,760
Well to understand that we have to look at his second comment too, he was considering

460
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:47,100
following Tom, but now he can see that Tom is no one that he should be associating with.

461
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:51,880
That damn disgusting tweet is enough evidence to show that he is in fact a cretin, but if

462
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,880
you genuinely believe that, you wouldn't have said that, simple as.

463
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,740
No one says that if it's not on the table in those circumstances, in fact the follow

464
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:04,160
here is clearly being used to put Tom in a double bind, either Tom grovels for the follow

465
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:08,280
and admits that they were horrible and affirms James' implications about the comments and

466
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:12,720
subsequent reputational damages, allowing people to hold it over him and thus tainting

467
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,480
his future statements on the animation community, or Tom stands his ground and forfeits the

468
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,480
follow.

469
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,300
Now it looks like James has dealt with animators too much, you'd probably roll over the opportunity

470
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,880
to get that follow if they just listened to his indirect advice.

471
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,720
Tom is not that sort of person, you clearly didn't watch his Keemstar video, and in

472
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,080
fact I spoke with someone briefly afterwards who had the exact same experience.

473
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,960
They got unfollowed because they put out a mean tweet towards an animator, and then received

474
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,480
the follow when they deleted it.

475
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,320
It's pretty shady leverage being operated, but above all it's just rather immature,

476
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,440
and immature is something that seems to pop up a lot.

477
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,800
After speaking to some people, we kinda agreed that James doesn't necessarily seem like

478
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,900
an unpleasant person, just someone who's never had to deal with a negative image being

479
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,820
portrayed of him, so is just oblivious of how to respond.

480
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:04,300
Another huge problem is that James and generally the animation community seem to value words

481
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:08,620
more than action, something that is viewed differently not just in the commentary sphere

482
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:11,740
but in the general YouTube sphere from what I've seen recently.

483
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:16,340
We like to ask what something can say about their character rather than just holding items

484
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,720
without context.

485
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,140
But there is still a more glaring point than this, at heart.

486
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:27,860
TheOdd1sOut has 8 million big fuck off subscribers, why on earth would he care about a commentator

487
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,840
and what he says about some community?

488
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,140
Why would it affect him?

489
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,860
Why would he want to bind his critics?

490
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:41,060
To respond to my question I just posed, I think this sentence from something else's

491
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,060
video sums it up quite well.

492
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:47,060
I mean as Jaden said, yeah, we all really depend on each other and actually help each

493
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,660
other behind the scenes.

494
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:52,980
Everyone really cares about helping themselves, that's fine, and it is definitely reflected

495
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,660
in how they defend each other.

496
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:58,980
However, if they are defending a community that will eventually be infiltrated by bad

497
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:03,060
actors, they will have a lot harder of a job retaining that audience, because when

498
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,320
you live as a collective, you die as a collective.

499
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,300
They are collectivists, which works great when everyone is winning and getting loads

500
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,540
of views.

501
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:15,980
But as the Ted Talk revealed, all it takes is one bad taker getting out of hand to fuck

502
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,980
it all up.

503
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,740
Let's go right back to the start of the video, I spoke about old animation and how

504
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,500
it had a sharp downfall.

505
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,080
Many of these YouTubers who I've spoken about today are probably those who are most

506
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,080
aware of it.

507
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,460
Obviously, as an animator, many of them probably grew up amongst people who inspired them but

508
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,960
fell foul to the algorithm.

509
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,120
A few of the YouTubers within the genre have even alluded to the algorithm, these guys

510
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:41,520
are not stupid and they understand how much of a prominent part it plays in their lives.

511
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,400
In case you haven't noticed, they tend to collaborate a lot, and they almost certainly

512
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
talk to each other.

513
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,400
They've really created a collectivist community that seeks to benefit them all at once.

514
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,600
As YouTubers, they also witness the downfall of people like Leafy and how a brief bump

515
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,600
can begin a domino effect that subsequently destroys the channel, and given the fact a

516
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,560
lot of animators have created this codependency, if one of them was to fall flat it could subsequently

517
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,960
knock a load of them.

518
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,180
So the odd ones out interest and involvement in this topic and those who criticise it suddenly

519
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,040
becomes a lot more understandable.

520
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,720
And I do empathise with his approach, but it doesn't justify the actions always being

521
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,880
taken, nor does it change the fact that there are certain conclusions that can be drawn

522
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,880
from this behaviour.

523
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,200
This is why people do care about the fact that many respond to criticism badly.

524
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,400
As I said, there's a watering hole, and where there's a watering hole, there'll be people

525
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,040
attempting to poison it.

526
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:34,580
And in fact, I think the collectivist nature definitely poses the question, what happens

527
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,240
when something worse happens?

528
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,240
Because it will.

529
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,620
What happens when someone undesirable gets amongst the pack?

530
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,060
What if it's happening already?

531
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,980
What if it's already happened and it's just been swept under the rug?

532
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,120
How do you deal with that?

533
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,140
Because although what we've discussed today mainly centres around qualms, and a fair amount

534
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:54,200
of them which could be considered trivial, their response and subsequent philosophy seems

535
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,900
to breed an environment of potential for exploitation, and for all we know it may have already occurred,

536
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:02,880
I mean you look at things like Me Too and you see how easy it is to conceal things that

537
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,760
seem so unbelievably obvious in hindsight.

538
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,980
That's a conceptual comparison by the way, I'm not suggesting that there are any sexual

539
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,780
criminals within that community, though obviously the truth is out there somewhere.

540
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:17,200
Given a lot of the criticism revolves around how these storytime animators have conducted

541
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:23,180
themselves outside of videos, and sometimes even in private, it raises a real question,

542
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:26,660
the dangerous difference between a public and private persona, and people like Darth

543
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:30,980
Pinya are growing and their criticism is considered more validated because people are beginning

544
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:35,140
to realise that these friendly, supposedly more open commentators behind the scenes may

545
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:39,260
not be any more trustworthy than the previous generation that had been purged.

546
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:42,740
And bring it back to the original comment, that's what happens when you have a formula,

547
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:47,140
that's what happens when people realise that all you need is this persona, with some deviations

548
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:51,020
maybe, and sure there are people who definitely stand out from that, but if anyone can make

549
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:55,960
it using that, then the community will be infiltrated, Fox Goodman is not the first,

550
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:00,080
and he is certainly not the last, and as soon as it's been shown that anyone can do that,

551
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,760
then the whole concept becomes dubious to audiences.

552
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,200
Now once again, people will always act on the notion of innocent until proven guilty,

553
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,060
and I think that's the right thing to do, however that protective shield of premise

554
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:15,860
alone just is not there anymore, the animation community is built on the foundations that

555
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:21,300
depend on each other, on interdependency and interdependency, interdependency because

556
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:26,140
their personas are composed of many components of purity which set such a high bar that any

557
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:30,720
contradiction could cause that image to deteriorate, and interdependency and the fact that they

558
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,520
rely on each other to benefit the algorithm, therefore they need to equally preserve themselves

559
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,520
and each other.

560
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:42,160
And when things happen like this, it foreshadows something, and people are not reacting just

561
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,520
to what has happened, which is what the animators seem to wrongly construe, they're reacting

562
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,480
to the implications, they're reacting to the character narratives, they're reacting to

563
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,980
the possibilities in the future, and although the collective approach may benefit those

564
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:59,840
when it is successful, it will be highly detrimental when the pressure sets in and some creators

565
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,840
buckle.

566
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,640
Human nature dictates that.

567
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,920
Every community will have its due date, you can't stop an image being somewhat stained,

568
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,540
you can postpone it, but you cannot prevent it, and by making your content more intertwined

569
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:16,220
all you do is make it more susceptible when that day finally comes, when you represent

570
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:20,060
each other at your best, you represent each other at your worst.

571
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:26,020
There is a mix of hypocrisy, hubris, and even a touch of hysteria, but we can only look

572
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:30,300
currently from the observation deck, who knows what's going on behind the scenes.

573
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:35,340
I highly doubt that many of these people I've spoken about today are bad, in fact very few.

574
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:39,240
When you've spoken to people, and when you yourself have suffered at the hands of systems

575
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,240
structured no different to the one being established within storytime animation, it

576
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,640
becomes difficult to defend, especially when wrongdoings are being committed, and many

577
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,800
people who likely have experienced that too will wake up to the concept.

578
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,000
When you have an accessible community, like any, you have the good and the bad, but the

579
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,280
animation community seems set on only showing the good and hiding the bad, which is kind

580
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:04,960
of ironic as people kind of turn to the community to address their own imperfections, and as

581
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,700
commentators like the ones we've spoken about today force open the doors they will

582
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:13,740
show more and more cracks that we previously glossed over, and people's opinions will change.

583
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,700
If I were them, would I be concerned?

584
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,400
I don't know, maybe they're just paranoid, but I might consider changing my behaviour

585
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:25,620
towards those outside the community, something isn't better just because it takes more effort.

586
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:29,460
To summarise, when your community becomes accessible to less than talented creators,

587
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:34,380
and when an easy formula is in place then it's only a matter of time before the negative

588
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:39,380
starts to flow in, at which point many audiences will look to you to oust those people, however

589
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:43,620
with the attitudes adopted by the creators they seem to have a problem with that, at

590
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:47,900
which point the audience will lose that core faith in the creator, and the genre will subsequently

591
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:52,620
perish, and given how you set the standards, you're not going to make it easy for yourselves.

592
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:57,160
A genre itself can never be the good guy, and the animators may be able to outrun the

593
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:01,780
characters in their stories, may be able to outrun the fat kid, but they can't outrun

594
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:06,460
criticism, they can't outrun the algorithm, and they sure as hell can't outrun me.

595
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,460
The right opinion.

596
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:34,980
You can't think of anything else to say, I hope everyone as well, I as always appreciate

597
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:41,240
the support, the very passionate support, it is why I carry on doing this, I really

598
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,740
could have taken a break now, it's the start of the university year and I want to carry

599
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:50,720
on, I spoke to my parents and they said James, carry on your YouTube, see what you can do,

600
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:56,180
and so here I am sat here recording another one in a fucking mess of a desk slash mini

601
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:03,100
recording studio, which is barely, barely workable, but with enough perseverance it

602
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,220
may just pay off.

603
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:09,220
Next week hopefully the video will be more polished, that's all I can say.

604
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,900
So until then however, I'm The Right Opinion and I'll see you in the next one.

605
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,220
Bye.

606
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:35,240
Bye.
