00:00.000 --> 00:09.320
What if the world you knew wasn't as it was?

00:09.320 --> 00:29.000
What if all the people, the names, the faces, the emotions, were not real?

00:29.000 --> 00:41.000
What if your idols were just blueprints?

00:59.000 --> 01:24.840
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

01:24.840 --> 01:25.840
too much free time.

01:25.840 --> 01:31.600
And something told me this had to be done, today we talk about story time, animators.

01:31.600 --> 01:35.640
And it came from an interesting source, you see I have goodfellas who's content I support

01:35.640 --> 01:38.760
and so I'm going to drop it a view and send them some constructive feedback.

01:38.760 --> 01:43.440
The video I decided to check out on the 17th of August 2018, was Turkey Tom's video

01:43.440 --> 01:44.600
on animators.

01:44.600 --> 01:48.960
It was a fine enough video, there was definitely insight and information revealed, and I'll

01:48.960 --> 01:52.080
leave it in the description below if you want to go and see it for yourself.

01:52.080 --> 01:55.640
However there was one comment that specifically caught my attention, and it's a passing

01:55.640 --> 02:13.520
one really.

02:13.520 --> 02:18.120
Yes an aside comment about the personas adopted by story time animators, admittedly a genre

02:18.120 --> 02:22.600
that I don't have that much interest in, gave me a simple lightbulb moment.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.840
What is that lightbulb moment?

02:23.840 --> 02:26.800
Well you'll have to be patient, because right now we're going to provide a little

02:26.800 --> 02:31.460
synopsis of what the animation community is, because I'm sure many of you may be unfamiliar

02:31.460 --> 02:33.520
with this swelling group of creators.

02:33.520 --> 02:37.240
To understand the evolution we need to go back a few years, because there was a time

02:37.240 --> 02:43.000
when animation was all over YouTube, it was inescapable, a range of unique creators converging

02:43.000 --> 02:47.600
in this place that supported their individuality, YouTube was almost custom made for it, the

02:47.600 --> 02:51.800
idea that people were expressing themselves, that's what YouTube was all about, and

02:51.800 --> 02:55.720
their effort was being rewarded in one of the most fulfilling ways possible.

02:55.720 --> 03:00.040
In the early days, animators focused mainly on a distinct style to find themselves, in

03:00.040 --> 03:03.840
a video reflecting on this, Quinton reviews depicted the intricate style that each of

03:03.840 --> 03:04.840
them took.

03:04.840 --> 03:08.040
I won't repeat what he said, but in the early days of YouTube there were many creators

03:08.040 --> 03:12.800
who really set themselves apart using information, and you know what, I liked it a lot.

03:12.800 --> 03:16.700
Even though it wasn't as direct and to the point as many other videos, you could see

03:16.700 --> 03:21.980
what was being expressed through the cartoons, personally I'm a big fan of show not tell

03:21.980 --> 03:25.240
storytelling, and even if the stuff seems shallow on the surface, when you broke a lot

03:25.240 --> 03:29.620
of it down, it seemed to reveal interesting layers, and that stuff really rocked the boat

03:29.620 --> 03:31.400
of YouTube.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.740
But then, it just stopped.

03:33.740 --> 03:36.780
I'm sure many of you will know the story, but to those who don't, YouTube run a range

03:36.780 --> 03:41.260
of algorithms that decide whether a genre lives or dies, and whether they decide it

03:41.260 --> 03:45.300
wasn't profitable enough, or just the views began to dip a tad, YouTube decide to pull

03:45.300 --> 03:49.820
the plug, and these animators were left in the dark.

03:49.820 --> 03:54.100
Many moons passed and the sun seemed set on those in the animation genre, no gaps really

03:54.100 --> 03:59.200
opened up, YouTube felt like a different place than therefore was documented by many, however

03:59.200 --> 04:02.580
by 2016 there was a new gap in the market.

04:02.580 --> 04:06.660
2016 was an interesting year, not just for YouTube but for people, we were moving into

04:06.660 --> 04:11.140
a more volatile area, there was an era of cynicism, but one thing I'd say in particular

04:11.140 --> 04:14.620
was that people were becoming more aware, aware of the world around them, aware of the

04:14.620 --> 04:18.820
tactics being used by people who were previously trusted, people no longer sought after those

04:18.820 --> 04:23.560
who pandered to their sympathies, it was a real shift in mentality across the spectrum,

04:23.560 --> 04:27.860
and that awareness of the world around them led to an equally increased awareness of self.

04:27.860 --> 04:32.100
It led to a more brooding generation, a set of people looking more inside themselves rather

04:32.100 --> 04:36.460
than looking for exterior validation from the previous set of superficial creators,

04:36.460 --> 04:40.440
and through this rose a very interesting genre known as storytime animation.

04:40.440 --> 04:44.060
Most people here will probably know the odd ones out who was one of the real pioneers

04:44.060 --> 04:48.480
of the genre, at the turn of 2016 he had little more than 10,000 subscribers, yet by

04:48.480 --> 04:51.260
the end he had over 2 million.

04:51.260 --> 04:52.260
Why though?

04:52.260 --> 04:55.700
Well his content reflected the landscape that I just described you, when looking inside

04:55.700 --> 04:59.140
themselves people found insecurities, things that they wanted to change, and no longer

04:59.140 --> 05:03.180
did they look to these fake smiley vloggers, just gloss over it and show the nice bright

05:03.180 --> 05:07.060
side of everything, they wanted people who would put in that sort of self reflection

05:07.060 --> 05:08.340
into their content.

05:08.340 --> 05:11.740
Now it's not like the vloggers and other content didn't try to put deep moments in

05:11.740 --> 05:15.900
their videos but it was almost always given a contrived gloss or stuck at the end of a

05:15.900 --> 05:19.300
video in which they went out and bought a new Bentley for their second cousin.

05:19.300 --> 05:22.340
It was hard to relate to struggles, that's what I'm saying, particularly when they

05:22.340 --> 05:26.500
were presented in a way that we didn't see them inside ourselves, however by reflecting

05:26.500 --> 05:30.340
on the past the odd ones out tapped into an authenticity, whereas the former class of

05:30.340 --> 05:34.120
vloggers took general struggles and made them personalised, the odd ones out reversed that

05:34.120 --> 05:39.000
formula and took the humdrum of everyday life and presented them in a light that made people

05:39.000 --> 05:44.440
think this guy gets me, he took his own individual situations and tinted them in a timeless sentiment

05:44.440 --> 05:48.960
that appealed to the current generation of our introspective youth, I respect him for

05:48.960 --> 05:49.960
that.

05:49.960 --> 05:54.280
As I've said before I went to VidCon 2018 this year, it gave me lots of individual epiphanies,

05:54.280 --> 05:57.720
moments that just stuck out in my head, one of those was the moment when I was passing

05:57.720 --> 06:01.600
through the merch stands and I remember feeling kinda weird when I saw the merchandising for

06:01.600 --> 06:05.100
Jaiden animations and the odd ones out, just a discomfort.

06:05.100 --> 06:09.060
My logic soon kicked in overriding this gut instinct, at the end of the day, anyone who

06:09.060 --> 06:13.140
has that following should be completely allowed to sell merch, after all, their fans want

06:13.140 --> 06:17.260
to support it too, but it did make me wonder, when something like their content, content

06:17.260 --> 06:21.260
that seems so wholesome and grassroots in their appeal, that speaks to people as sometimes

06:21.260 --> 06:25.840
their most vulnerable, could be taken advantage of and transformed into a cash cow, how long

06:25.840 --> 06:29.360
is it until the wrong sort of people try to jump on the bandwagon?

06:29.360 --> 06:33.560
And that brings us back to our quote, today we will discuss a plethora of questions, why

06:33.560 --> 06:37.160
the animation community is unique in a way, but at the same time how that could both damage

06:37.160 --> 06:40.800
their reputation and make them susceptible to criticism, the problems with their often

06:40.800 --> 06:44.680
dismissive and passive aggressive responses to their critics, and how that for many viewers

06:44.680 --> 06:49.260
foreshadows a worrisome trend noticed in many YouTube genres before it, and perhaps leading

06:49.260 --> 06:50.880
them to the same fate.

06:50.880 --> 06:56.120
So without further ado, I suggest we cut into this spicy piece, let's get to it.

07:07.120 --> 07:11.640
Lack of authenticity has been a problem endemic to YouTube, what is remotely different about

07:11.640 --> 07:13.120
this situation?

07:13.120 --> 07:17.100
Well let's explain that, you see content creators like vloggers may have been disingenuous,

07:17.100 --> 07:21.760
in fact fuck it of course they were disingenuous, but they seldom sold it as anything else,

07:21.760 --> 07:25.420
everyone knew that it wasn't exactly them, and when they did it, it wasn't the crux

07:25.420 --> 07:30.340
of their channel, it wasn't the core appeal, it was just an outlet to their forever dramatising

07:30.340 --> 07:34.420
forced personality, which I have laid into multiple times at this point.

07:34.420 --> 07:38.620
However with these story time animators, it is them, this is who they are, and the struggles

07:38.620 --> 07:42.020
influence their character and the interaction they have with their followers, and that's

07:42.020 --> 07:45.980
important it's not something you should take advantage of, equally it means that in

07:45.980 --> 07:50.220
the genre they set the bar incredibly high for conduct, they can't behave like Joey

07:50.220 --> 07:53.980
Salads because they present themselves as better, and you can tell that they believe

07:53.980 --> 07:54.980
it.

07:54.980 --> 07:58.660
So why are we still talking about the way they respond to criticism, and why does it

07:58.660 --> 07:59.660
matter?

07:59.660 --> 08:02.700
When documenting the original set of animators, Quinton reviews really showed how each of

08:02.700 --> 08:06.380
these individuals had their own personality, channeled through their art, and the beauty

08:06.380 --> 08:10.500
that it really created, and so when the clip that we observed in the Turkey Tom video was

08:10.500 --> 08:14.900
played, it sent up some red flags, how can you summarise a premise of a genre in one

08:14.900 --> 08:15.900
sentence?

08:15.900 --> 08:18.740
The reason I left out the whole sentiment of his video, whether proven or not, was that

08:18.740 --> 08:21.660
there were creators out there who had real trouble taking criticism.

08:21.660 --> 08:25.240
Now obviously it depends on how that criticism is delivered, you're not going to engage

08:25.240 --> 08:29.300
in someone who's rude or attempts to snidely undermine you, however given the behaviour

08:29.300 --> 08:33.340
of some of these animators, when someone makes fairly passable comments, and you react with

08:33.340 --> 08:37.420
great volatility, then it could be a sign of insecurity, I know commentators who are

08:37.420 --> 08:41.540
very aware that the current content they're creating is some part of their ability, it

08:41.540 --> 08:48.120
is written all over their attitude, and I've read it.

08:48.120 --> 08:52.700
Now insecurity isn't always a sign of mal-intent, someone may just be socially anxious, however

08:52.700 --> 08:56.540
it is definitely cause for further investigation, and that's what we're going to be doing

08:56.540 --> 08:57.540
today.

08:57.540 --> 09:00.900
It's also important to note that another YouTuber, Darth Pinya, has done multiple videos

09:00.900 --> 09:04.740
covering the individual YouTubers, and I would definitely recommend checking out some of

09:04.740 --> 09:09.540
his videos, however today we may use certain individual YouTubers as exemplars, but the

09:09.540 --> 09:13.540
greater point will be made discussing the culture that surrounds the genre, and why

09:13.540 --> 09:17.060
surface value innocence is lined with a sharp poison.

09:17.060 --> 09:22.580
For storytime animators, people wanted to move away from the inauthentic superficiality,

09:22.580 --> 09:26.320
so we looked for people to fill in the void of these new characters, characters that we

09:26.320 --> 09:30.240
assessed as deeper, but if the trials and tribulations of these individuals are being

09:30.240 --> 09:34.500
summed up so succinctly, then we might have a new problem on our hands, but at least let's

09:34.500 --> 09:39.060
try to break the formula down into a few more sentences, and work out where the leverage

09:39.060 --> 09:41.060
is being operated.

09:41.060 --> 09:45.300
Now you must understand that due to my status as a prominent cynic, that I went into these

09:45.300 --> 09:49.700
videos expecting to detest most to all of them, nonetheless I watched the old ones out

09:49.700 --> 09:54.620
and came to the realisation that his content was actually pretty great, not anything necessarily

09:54.620 --> 09:59.180
that I would watch, just not really my style, but he was a pretty compelling creator, sometimes

09:59.180 --> 10:03.860
the pioneer of a genre is retrospectively seen as actually a pretty average creator

10:03.860 --> 10:08.700
who just struck gold with the topics, think Trigga Tro, Leafy and so on, not saying they're

10:08.700 --> 10:12.380
bad exactly, but it's clear that there were better creators who knew how to utilise

10:12.380 --> 10:16.860
their topics with more panache, however James here clearly actually has raw talent that

10:16.860 --> 10:20.820
extends beyond the base formula, and so I was pleasantly surprised, his story said more

10:20.820 --> 10:25.940
about himself than he needed to say explicitly, show not tell, he's mastered it, so props

10:25.940 --> 10:30.060
to him for doing that, however I did not expect him to be the target of this video because

10:30.060 --> 10:34.160
he was doing it before it was popular, and that's something that no uninspired leech

10:34.160 --> 10:35.360
would ever do.

10:35.360 --> 10:39.600
So from the old ones out, it inevitably seemed like it was going to go downhill, it wasn't

10:39.600 --> 10:43.560
necessarily a sharp drop in quality though, there were just certain cracks that became

10:43.560 --> 10:47.520
noticeable, that sent off signals that didn't endear me as a viewer, alongside watching

10:47.520 --> 10:51.480
their content I watched Da Pinya's videos about the creators, not just as a monitor

10:51.480 --> 10:55.880
to make sure I didn't miss anything, but also to see how they had responded, that can

10:55.880 --> 11:00.960
be equally as revealing as the content itself, but let's talk about the appeal of the content.

11:00.960 --> 11:05.120
I've spoken about this earlier, but a word I'm using a lot is authenticity, I think

11:05.120 --> 11:08.880
it's safe to say that it is one of the key hooks of the storytime animator, these

11:08.880 --> 11:13.640
people are living life, therefore there are two components that are central to these characters,

11:13.640 --> 11:17.760
honesty and entertainment, if either of these were compromised the fans would be unlikely

11:17.760 --> 11:21.440
to support the creator, what I like about the old ones out is that he manages to make

11:21.440 --> 11:25.520
the mundane details interesting, and this is why in my opinion, he'll always be the

11:25.520 --> 11:26.520
most successful.

11:26.520 --> 11:31.560
This is not to say that no other individuals in this genre have the capability to be interesting,

11:31.560 --> 11:35.180
they're actually completely the opposite, however their personalities in particular

11:35.180 --> 11:38.920
and sometimes their humour seem to lack a pizzazz, in fact if you just stripped them

11:38.920 --> 11:43.560
down to the core personality many of them wouldn't be interesting at all, so how do

11:43.560 --> 11:44.900
you circumvent that?

11:44.900 --> 11:50.020
What I found for many of these creators who may not be so recognisable on the personality

11:50.020 --> 11:54.880
area was that they often used dramatised source material, dramatised source material isn't

11:54.880 --> 12:00.000
a bad thing necessarily, though it gives the actual storyteller less work, coasting on

12:00.000 --> 12:02.920
the crazy plot and clickbait titles.

12:02.920 --> 12:03.920
Why is that?

12:03.920 --> 12:07.280
Well you can't be boring while presenting it as entertaining, because at that point

12:07.280 --> 12:11.920
it just becomes entertaining, but you can be dishonest while presenting it as honest,

12:11.920 --> 12:16.060
you can't really answer the question of whether these things happened or not, nor

12:16.060 --> 12:20.560
can you pick out specific events, but eventually with the clickbait and the sort of embellishment

12:20.560 --> 12:24.360
that I observed, I began to feel like some of the videos were just Tarnamon Goose on

12:24.360 --> 12:29.320
paper, just with a bit more personality, which is obviously welcome, but it's not impossible

12:29.320 --> 12:33.360
to tell stories, so I don't really rate that alone, once again you can't prove it

12:33.360 --> 12:37.080
as fake, but it's understandable to be sceptical of the idea that all of these people

12:37.080 --> 12:41.440
with such a backlog of interesting stories remembered so well in their memory, down to

12:41.440 --> 12:46.000
specific details have all converged in one community, hella fucking coincidence.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.040
And in fact if you don't want me to spell it out to you, TerryTV Will, another youtuber

12:51.040 --> 12:55.200
reached out to me saying he made a video on him that hadn't even accumulated 100 views

12:55.200 --> 13:00.200
when good old Terry went on his little diatribe, for the record TerryTV is a trend hopper creator

13:00.200 --> 13:04.480
who recently decided to jack storytime animation, and use the fact that he had mentioned that

13:04.480 --> 13:09.760
his series were exaggerated as a defence for exaggerating, fair point of course, until

13:09.760 --> 13:14.120
you dig further and realise that he only announced it was exaggerated in the last two minutes

13:14.120 --> 13:18.360
of the final video of the series, after an unofficial outro.

13:18.360 --> 13:22.080
I know a lot of you guys have been asking in the comments if these stories are true,

13:22.080 --> 13:27.640
the answer is yes, to an extent, they are based off of my life, but as some of you guessed

13:27.640 --> 13:32.200
in the comments, yes, some things that happened in the story were exaggerated a little bit

13:32.200 --> 13:35.680
just for comedic effect, or just to make the story a little more interesting.

13:35.680 --> 13:40.600
And after, he'd accumulated over 2 million views, kinda like me conducting a series of

13:40.600 --> 13:45.380
pranks and then declaring them fake in my final video after reaping the sweet ad revenue.

13:45.380 --> 13:48.320
He said he wanted to address the claims, but I wonder why he didn't address them at the

13:48.320 --> 13:50.400
end of the second video at least.

13:50.400 --> 13:54.600
In fact, TerryTV seems quite sure that he made it so obvious that it was exaggerated,

13:54.600 --> 13:58.680
which does make me wonder why he even cares about someone calling him out for it.

13:58.680 --> 14:03.040
It's Hollywood guys, storytime animators are Hollywood, put that quote on a wall lads,

14:03.040 --> 14:07.120
I'm sure that's exactly what people like the odd ones out want to hear.

14:07.120 --> 14:11.520
Now make no mistake, TerryTV is a trend hopper, and his movement to animation is the perfect

14:11.520 --> 14:14.480
embodiment of what we're going to be talking about today.

14:14.480 --> 14:18.640
In a recent video, Darkpina very briefly showed that somehow a YouTuber had managed to expose

14:18.640 --> 14:22.740
himself as faking his stories, as this guy who had two accounts, Fox Goodman and Matt

14:22.740 --> 14:27.160
Spicer had released two videos on the same subject, both telling different stories.

14:27.160 --> 14:31.120
The fact that in a discrete environment, someone has nonetheless managed to show themselves

14:31.120 --> 14:34.600
as falsifying stories should say how easy it actually is.

14:34.600 --> 14:39.560
The problem is beyond the concept and combination of animation, the content exists on a spectrum,

14:39.560 --> 14:43.040
it's easy to see the difference between the best and worst creators.

14:43.040 --> 14:47.680
This is fine, in fact, clip baiting, telling exaggerated stories, having lower quality

14:47.720 --> 14:52.280
and even being emotionally manipulative in certain scenarios is not unreasonable, if

14:52.280 --> 14:56.740
you are fairly lazy with your animations and it attains views then more power to you.

14:56.740 --> 15:01.520
The point is that no genre is truly above criticism, you do not have the sole ability

15:01.520 --> 15:06.360
to be better by any excuse, but the problem is that they seem to adopt this holier-than-thou

15:06.360 --> 15:10.600
attitude when responding to criticism, because there are people who will take problems with

15:10.600 --> 15:13.920
all of the things that I've just listed, and that's the simple fact of the moral

15:13.920 --> 15:17.620
compass, some people view things as acceptable, other people don't.

15:17.620 --> 15:20.060
What matters to the viewer, is consistency.

15:20.060 --> 15:24.380
One of the points that I saw made from time to time was that because animation videos

15:24.380 --> 15:30.340
as a basis take more effort than per se, Fortnite videos, thanks James, that you cannot call

15:30.340 --> 15:35.140
animation lazy, because there are other genres of video that take less effort at their best

15:35.140 --> 15:37.580
than animation at their worst.

15:37.580 --> 15:42.080
Though James my friend, that is just subjective commentary, individuals are compared to others

15:42.080 --> 15:46.320
within their own genre, because that's where the appeal lies, however under the precipice

15:46.320 --> 15:50.200
of content superiority, this bizarre standard has been adopted.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.880
Let me ask you this, is Beethoven's 5th better than Lose Yourself because it took

15:53.880 --> 15:55.680
longer or more effort?

15:55.680 --> 15:57.280
Does it not want criticism?

15:57.280 --> 16:01.940
No, because an unbelievably high amount of effort is assumed in the premise of the former,

16:01.940 --> 16:05.920
it does not push the genre of orchestral symphonies above criticism.

16:05.920 --> 16:10.740
You can defend a genre from criticism on its own, you can defend an individual creator

16:10.740 --> 16:15.600
from criticism on its own, but to use a genre to create an umbrella defense for all its

16:15.600 --> 16:20.260
animators is a fallacy of division, assuming all components are good because the greater

16:20.260 --> 16:21.840
product is good.

16:21.840 --> 16:26.220
This partly explains why until the last month, storytime animators seldom receive the same

16:26.220 --> 16:30.760
level of scrutiny as other communities, but there's also more to say about that.

16:30.760 --> 16:34.820
With storytime animators, everything is drenched in a level of emotional depth that makes it

16:34.820 --> 16:39.120
hard to criticise, everyone seems more wholesome, if you criticise them, you're criticising

16:39.120 --> 16:43.320
a character that has developed more intricate relationships with the audiences, and you

16:43.320 --> 16:45.440
do feel bad for criticising that.

16:45.440 --> 16:50.500
However, regardless of the level of effort in videos, every creator should be open to

16:50.500 --> 16:56.680
some level of criticism, no matter how fantastic their character is, talking down their content

16:56.680 --> 17:00.100
or argumentative points is never off the table.

17:06.680 --> 17:10.140
In case it hasn't been discussed enough already, some of these creators do not like

17:10.140 --> 17:14.760
receiving criticism themselves, in fact their response in certain instances has been bemusing,

17:14.760 --> 17:19.100
whether it was dismissing it as subjective commentary, blocking individuals, or downloading

17:19.100 --> 17:24.360
a video so as to not give a creator the views, that last one is truly hilarious because of

17:24.360 --> 17:25.720
the effort it requires.

17:25.720 --> 17:30.840
None of my points previous are trying to show the animators as quote bad human beings, however

17:30.840 --> 17:35.320
the self-appointed sanctity that they give themselves is rather unfounded, as undoubtedly

17:35.320 --> 17:39.800
many of them participate in the same behaviours that any other non-animation YouTube genre

17:39.800 --> 17:44.440
has profited from, if someone chooses to criticise them for that, the fact that its animation

17:44.440 --> 17:45.960
doesn't absolve them.

17:45.960 --> 17:49.380
The reason why some of them do have trouble responding to criticism is something known

17:49.380 --> 17:53.760
as the good guy complex, the fact that whether these people are good or bad within the community,

17:53.760 --> 17:57.920
they have developed such an idea focused around being the protagonist, the criticism against

17:57.920 --> 18:01.320
them is seen as unjustified because of their greater morality.

18:01.320 --> 18:06.200
This is something we have encountered constantly on numerous occasions, from Greg Paul to Fouseytube,

18:06.200 --> 18:10.240
the idea that there is a greater good that justifies the little mishaps.

18:10.240 --> 18:14.560
Although their attitude is harder to point out as they don't explicitly say it, often

18:14.560 --> 18:18.240
it's just little side references where you know you've gotten under their skin.

18:41.200 --> 18:45.200
Most of these demonstrate animators setting up strawmen over how their criticism is delivered

18:45.200 --> 18:50.400
and then telling their fans that these ridiculous ideas are not worth engaging with, while implying

18:50.400 --> 18:53.040
some generality in the idea of these critics.

18:53.040 --> 18:58.000
Probably one of the best examples of this was when something else YT made a video titled

18:58.000 --> 19:06.240
Ripoffs, in which he decided to define ripoffs before explaining why he couldn't be his

19:06.240 --> 19:16.640
own definition of ripoff, which yes, he's not directly copying or plagiarising, but

19:16.640 --> 19:20.840
I feel those claiming he was a quote ripoff were referring to the second definition in

19:20.840 --> 19:29.360
the dictionary, you know the inferior imitation one, and although you may be past that stage,

19:29.360 --> 19:31.120
I understand what people were saying.

19:31.120 --> 19:35.120
He then goes on to say that no one owns a style, and although true in this situation

19:35.120 --> 19:39.640
it doesn't really contradict the idea of ripoffs existing, no one was trying to sue

19:39.640 --> 19:40.640
you.

19:40.640 --> 19:44.160
He then follows this by saying that because Let's Play YouTubers regularly play the same

19:44.160 --> 19:49.400
game and have the same style of editing and are not considered ripoffs, he can't be considered

19:49.400 --> 19:51.080
a ripoff either.

19:51.080 --> 19:57.600
So let me rephrase this logical fallacy for everyone to understand how ridiculous it is.

19:57.600 --> 20:03.100
Because one artist draws with a pencil and another artist draws with a pencil and neither

20:03.100 --> 20:08.460
are ripping off each other, then if one artist's style resembles the other, then that cannot

20:08.460 --> 20:09.940
be a ripoff either.

20:09.940 --> 20:12.280
Sounds a bit silly now, doesn't it?

20:12.280 --> 20:20.540
On top of that he said, in fact it's all fine because he has a different personality.

20:20.540 --> 20:25.380
Suddenly to this creator, design seems much less a factor, but he seems more offended

20:25.380 --> 20:29.540
at the idea that people were judging him above all, however the tone of the specific video

20:29.540 --> 20:37.360
is what caught my attention.

20:37.360 --> 20:42.420
One of enlightenment, there are a lot of stupid people in this world and something else YT

20:42.420 --> 20:48.180
here is going to sit you all down and provide you with an education free of charge.

20:48.180 --> 20:49.420
How kind.

20:49.420 --> 20:54.740
He is an animator, and because he is an animator and he doesn't directly copy, then to call

20:54.740 --> 20:58.500
him a ripoff is the most audacious thing you could do.

20:58.500 --> 21:02.700
What I'm trying to say is that many of these creators almost seem offended at the idea

21:02.700 --> 21:07.160
that they could be perceived as anything else than what they want their audience to see

21:07.160 --> 21:11.300
them as, even when it's trivial things like ripoffs.

21:11.300 --> 21:16.020
Some may argue that there is no credible argument against such things like clickbait or faking

21:16.020 --> 21:21.020
and exaggerating stories and even ripping off when it's commonplace on YouTube.

21:21.020 --> 21:25.020
Let me tell you, I've come across a few right opinion clones in my time, although not an

21:25.020 --> 21:28.780
unreasonable argument, I think the fact that storytime YouTubers base their appeal and

21:28.780 --> 21:33.020
build relationships, and subsequently profit off the trust and authenticity that their

21:33.020 --> 21:38.380
content pervades, does mean that if a commentator wants to contradict that, to show up an element

21:38.380 --> 21:43.140
that their audience may not have seen before, that may alter their perception, then they

21:43.140 --> 21:45.160
equally have a right to do so.

21:45.160 --> 21:50.540
And if the animators want to act holier than thou, then they're going to be held to holier

21:50.540 --> 21:52.420
than thou standards.

21:52.420 --> 21:54.500
They did this to themselves.

21:54.500 --> 21:59.420
And judging by the little things, when researching through Da Pinya's videos, it's clear that

21:59.420 --> 22:04.500
a few of them have felt guilty about things they've done, one of the minor very telling

22:04.500 --> 22:10.740
changes was the removal of the featuring odd ones out credit on Tim Toms video title, which

22:10.740 --> 22:12.140
blew him up.

22:12.140 --> 22:17.180
After all, putting features when they barely feature is seen by some as marginally objectionable,

22:17.180 --> 22:21.300
and given how sometimes they've complained about it, I understand why.

22:21.300 --> 22:26.980
However, you cannot deny the past, it still happened, and you still did it that way.

22:26.980 --> 22:30.640
If you think that might contradict your image, well, you should have thought about that before.

22:30.640 --> 22:34.140
The problem is, with their success, there are always people looking to profit off it

22:34.140 --> 22:38.320
without the same heart, without the same intentions as you, the good guy.

22:38.320 --> 22:41.300
And even as the good guy, you might make mistakes.

22:41.300 --> 22:44.620
It doesn't mean just because you're a good guy that you shouldn't be held to account

22:44.620 --> 22:45.620
on them.

22:45.620 --> 22:49.380
Almost every community is one that will have good creators and bad creators, good people

22:49.380 --> 22:50.380
and bad people.

22:50.460 --> 22:54.420
A clip from Tim Toms shows him expressing how everyone in the animation community is

22:54.420 --> 22:56.660
just so wonderful.

22:56.660 --> 23:02.140
You see in online communities, there's a lot of vitriol, a lot of anger, a lot of hatred.

23:02.140 --> 23:07.840
And what I've found with the animation community on YouTube is that that couldn't be farther

23:07.840 --> 23:08.840
from the truth.

23:08.840 --> 23:12.940
But I don't agree with that, though I do understand why he perceives it that way.

23:12.940 --> 23:17.660
The problem with the animation community is that the stock persona is inherently good,

23:17.660 --> 23:22.500
deep and likeable, and the little exaggerations are very subtle, so it becomes impossible

23:22.500 --> 23:26.820
to distinguish between those who are positive givers and helpful people, and those who are

23:26.820 --> 23:31.740
sucking out the energy of the community, those who may be participating in disingenuous practices,

23:31.740 --> 23:34.900
or those who are taking advantage of the kindness of others.

23:34.900 --> 23:38.900
It all becomes indistinguishable, which is rather dangerous for a community, because

23:38.900 --> 23:42.900
as a creator or as a viewer, you no longer know who to truly trust, you either put your

23:42.900 --> 23:46.000
faith in everyone, or you play your cards very carefully.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.200
Without catering to too many memes, there's this great Ted Talk, which discusses the concept

23:50.200 --> 23:53.840
of givers and takers, I'll leave it in the pinned comment though it may be among other

23:53.840 --> 23:57.400
links so you might have to control efforts, type in Ted or something.

23:57.400 --> 24:00.800
But obviously takers are people who always contribute the least while wanting to take

24:00.800 --> 24:05.640
the most, and there are also those who cater into the agreeable and disagreeable factions.

24:05.640 --> 24:10.320
The problem is the existence of agreeable takers, those who behave nicely while still

24:10.320 --> 24:12.320
taking advantage of others around them.

24:12.320 --> 24:17.600
To be successful in the animation community, your persona has to be inherently agreeable,

24:17.600 --> 24:22.340
so regardless of if you're a giver, taker, or a matcher, people cannot tell the difference.

24:22.340 --> 24:26.280
To suggest that through chance there has been this utopian community created where everyone

24:26.280 --> 24:31.640
who tries for success are just fantastic human beings, to me, and probably to many others,

24:31.640 --> 24:35.920
would be delusional, and it's only a matter of time until the leeches begin to pile on.

24:35.920 --> 24:39.880
And this is where everything comes full circle, because where there is success, there is a

24:39.880 --> 24:40.880
formula.

24:40.880 --> 24:45.040
There is the community circle, people want something more original, more organic, however

24:45.040 --> 24:49.360
as soon as people realise the opportunity, and as soon as the formula became clearer,

24:49.360 --> 24:55.240
and use that nature to create personas, that wholesome appeal will be undermined, and the

24:55.240 --> 24:59.580
flaws will start to show, even for the best.

24:59.580 --> 25:03.560
Eventually it's only a matter of time until people start to point out the flaws, that

25:03.560 --> 25:07.120
something's polluted and you can't run away from it, the problem is that publicly, it's

25:07.120 --> 25:11.920
very difficult to tell who's real and who's fake, but it won't stop people from trying,

25:11.920 --> 25:16.120
and so when responding to this, they have to keep this in mind, that the person who's

25:16.120 --> 25:19.320
criticised them may make some very compelling points.

25:19.320 --> 25:24.960
However, in this instance behind the agreeable facade lies a much more chronic problem.

25:24.960 --> 25:35.160
So recently, in spite of the absence of abhorrent scandals, they still have been receiving a

25:35.160 --> 25:37.240
significant amount of criticism.

25:37.240 --> 25:38.240
Why is that?

25:38.240 --> 25:42.280
They do seem to have the belief that they know their community better than me, which

25:42.280 --> 25:45.400
is probably true, but I know human nature better than them.

25:45.400 --> 25:48.840
You see, I've watched a lot of videos and seen a lot of legitimate criticism levelled

25:48.840 --> 25:52.480
against these creators, and I've levelled a lot of criticism which I think is fair,

25:52.480 --> 25:55.800
not just current but speculative, but I don't think they'll be acknowledged because of their

25:55.800 --> 25:58.160
nature to respond in an interesting manner.

25:58.160 --> 26:00.640
We're going to fall back to the Something Else YT video.

26:00.640 --> 26:04.600
So I left this final part out of his response to the allegations against him that he was

26:04.600 --> 26:07.120
a rip-off because they're most relevant here.

26:07.120 --> 26:11.800
Basically, he not only says himself, but he features Jayden Animations, another YouTuber,

26:11.800 --> 26:15.660
to say he's not ripping off anyone and they don't mind because they're there to help each

26:15.660 --> 26:16.660
other out.

26:16.660 --> 26:22.000
So writing mean comments calling people rip-offs is not helpful at all to the community.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.320
The greater good.

26:23.320 --> 26:27.720
And this is a problem, the storytime animation community sees themselves as one huge collective

26:27.720 --> 26:32.040
as they all note on multiple occasions stepping on each other's toes would be disastrous for

26:32.040 --> 26:38.540
the algorithm, or THE ALGORITHM as some like to brand it, so it only makes sense that they

26:38.540 --> 26:39.840
help each other out.

26:39.840 --> 26:43.120
On top of this it means defending each other which is something that they have done on

26:43.120 --> 26:46.840
multiple occasions, they all seem to be in a consensual business friendship with each

26:46.840 --> 26:51.120
other, if someone's leeching a bit then that's alright because even if they do it helps everyone

26:51.120 --> 26:54.600
out, using tags for views, sure, go for it.

26:54.600 --> 26:57.920
That's all good but you can't be surprised if someone calls you out for it, and saying

26:57.920 --> 27:01.980
that it's all alright because everyone in the specific context was fine with it just

27:01.980 --> 27:04.740
won't wash with many people, why is that?

27:04.740 --> 27:09.680
Because it doesn't contradict a greater narrative that may be implied about their character,

27:09.680 --> 27:13.600
and that's why the criticism against animation has been slowly grown, because in spite of

27:13.600 --> 27:18.520
their half responses they never work out how to actually contradict the narrative.

27:18.520 --> 27:22.320
Sometimes if you consent to something that could be perceived as bad, instead of cancelling

27:22.320 --> 27:26.760
the narrative it actually just extends to you as well, though it depends on the context

27:26.760 --> 27:27.760
of course.

27:27.800 --> 27:31.520
Jaden is perfectly embodied in Darth Pinya's content, a lot of his previous videos never

27:31.520 --> 27:35.520
gained much traction, because although his greater narrative contradicted the image that

27:35.520 --> 27:40.120
the storytime animation community tried to emulate, he never successfully disproved it,

27:40.120 --> 27:44.840
and in some instances he even received quite severe criticism such as his video on Jaden

27:44.840 --> 27:48.760
Animations, a video which I feel was quite misguided in its points.

27:57.760 --> 28:02.320
However with the recent drama slowly escalating, harsher criticism and more intense videos

28:02.320 --> 28:07.040
documenting more universally agreed wrongdoings such as tracing, neglect of credit to artists

28:07.040 --> 28:11.600
and just complete deflection of criticism on the back of simply awful reasoning, people's

28:11.600 --> 28:15.960
minds will slowly be changed, and every single one of his videos on that topic has slowly

28:15.960 --> 28:20.680
gained more credibility, and people will begin to doubt the rhetoric espoused by many others

28:20.680 --> 28:22.360
in defence of these creators.

28:22.360 --> 28:26.880
The reason is because the idea of just permitting it within the community exists beyond an inner

28:26.880 --> 28:31.760
circle, people begin to see how if kept up this could create disingenuous characters

28:31.760 --> 28:36.720
who not just exploit those within their circle but those outside, artists, fans and so on,

28:36.720 --> 28:38.600
it's probably happened already.

28:38.600 --> 28:42.000
People don't like the idea of that, people don't like the thought that they'd be

28:42.000 --> 28:46.880
contributing to something like that, even if everyone in that specific scenario is in

28:46.880 --> 28:47.880
support of it.

28:47.880 --> 28:52.280
If I gave someone permission to stab me, and they stab me, would it necessarily absolve

28:52.280 --> 28:53.280
them?

28:53.280 --> 28:57.280
If anyone here has watched Hot Fuzz I compare the animation community to Sandford, the sort

28:57.280 --> 29:01.520
of place that works so hard to keep a lovely image that it requires questionable action

29:01.520 --> 29:05.640
sometimes to preserve it, and they can feel the pressure and the harder they try to defend

29:05.640 --> 29:09.560
it the more I feel they have something to hide, and the more the cracks begin to show.

29:09.560 --> 29:13.560
A really interesting example of this was when a YouTuber by the name of MangaKamen made

29:13.560 --> 29:17.640
a response to Turkey Tom, the video was fair in many points, and it also brought up some

29:17.640 --> 29:21.960
tweets that Tom had subsequently deleted that would have given more context to his video.

29:21.960 --> 29:25.440
They were distasteful comments directed at someone's physical appearance, I am glad

29:25.440 --> 29:29.240
he removed them, and subsequently was made to apologise over them, people shouldn't

29:29.240 --> 29:33.240
just run away from these, and although I do have problems with the video I am almost certain

29:33.240 --> 29:38.440
they will be mostly discussed out by other YouTubers at this point, including Tom himself.

29:38.440 --> 29:41.560
Point is, his tweets were something that should have been included as a disclaimer given its

29:41.560 --> 29:45.680
relevance, and as he hadn't publicly apologised for them it is credible that it served as

29:45.680 --> 29:49.800
an alternative explanation for a server ban, and on top of that it looked like he was being

29:49.800 --> 29:53.480
a dick in a public Discord server, I might have banned him too.

29:53.480 --> 29:57.640
However no, what I found most interesting was the odd ones out's response in the comment

29:57.640 --> 29:58.640
section.

29:58.640 --> 30:04.960
Wow, I had no idea the stuff on Twitter happened, thanks for showing us, really makes me wonder

30:04.960 --> 30:10.200
why Tom left it out of his video, I've been binging your videos for a while, I think they

30:10.200 --> 30:14.320
are really good, I like that you have actual criticisms and bring up new things to the

30:14.320 --> 30:15.320
conversation.

30:15.320 --> 30:18.480
Well, James you're gonna love this next part.

30:18.480 --> 30:23.360
I have sung my praises for the man, and his content, but this is where it ends for now.

30:23.360 --> 30:27.400
James has no love for Tom and to be honest, if I were in his shoes I probably wouldn't

30:27.400 --> 30:28.400
either.

30:28.400 --> 30:31.520
But I don't like these comments, they're what I like to call an empty lead, it's a classic

30:31.520 --> 30:35.680
rhetorical tactic used by people when they want to take credibility from their detractors

30:35.680 --> 30:39.940
without giving them any way to respond to them, they firstly blow up whatever information

30:39.940 --> 30:45.760
or react in an emphatic manner, saying something like wow, amazing, and then imply that something

30:45.760 --> 30:49.600
worse must be behind it without explicitly saying what you're thinking.

30:49.600 --> 30:53.760
Like what on earth do you mean makes you wonder, Cayman here just spent a whole fucking video

30:53.760 --> 30:55.020
explaining it.

30:55.020 --> 30:58.380
This is the most that James can really exert influence, any greater acknowledgement of

30:58.380 --> 31:02.980
Turkey Tom would just be publicity for him, but my god does he try hard with everything

31:02.980 --> 31:03.980
he has.

31:03.980 --> 31:08.020
So I said to Tom in a group chat that it was a fair video on him, but what was with the

31:08.020 --> 31:10.940
old ones out comments, and boy, there was more.

31:10.940 --> 31:14.660
The old ones out had actually approached Tom and given him a whole lecture about the situation

31:14.660 --> 31:19.880
and how the tweets, the specific tweets, had ruined his reputation, and could follow him

31:19.880 --> 31:22.080
forever.

31:22.080 --> 31:32.680
No, that's what you wanted to do.

31:32.680 --> 31:36.140
It only vaguely compromised the points he made about the Discord server, everything

31:36.140 --> 31:38.700
else was presented in videos before anyway.

31:38.700 --> 31:43.160
And yes, as a joke it was poor form, but you're setting the bar pretty low if you believe

31:43.160 --> 31:48.200
those sorts of jokes ruin reputations, considering it has been fairly prevalent in many YouTubers,

31:48.200 --> 32:15.240
whether funny, or unfunny.

32:15.240 --> 32:18.560
And yes, he was specifically referring to the tweets to see the question, now James

32:18.560 --> 32:31.040
isn't stupid, and he knows that his mates have derided people's images in the past,

32:31.040 --> 32:35.120
and that although the targeted nature in this instance definitely makes it worse, it's

32:35.120 --> 32:36.120
not career ending.

32:36.120 --> 32:38.800
So why on earth would he make such a song and dance about it?

32:38.800 --> 32:42.760
Well to understand that we have to look at his second comment too, he was considering

32:42.760 --> 32:47.100
following Tom, but now he can see that Tom is no one that he should be associating with.

32:47.100 --> 32:51.880
That damn disgusting tweet is enough evidence to show that he is in fact a cretin, but if

32:51.880 --> 32:55.880
you genuinely believe that, you wouldn't have said that, simple as.

32:55.880 --> 32:59.740
No one says that if it's not on the table in those circumstances, in fact the follow

32:59.740 --> 33:04.160
here is clearly being used to put Tom in a double bind, either Tom grovels for the follow

33:04.160 --> 33:08.280
and admits that they were horrible and affirms James' implications about the comments and

33:08.280 --> 33:12.720
subsequent reputational damages, allowing people to hold it over him and thus tainting

33:12.720 --> 33:17.480
his future statements on the animation community, or Tom stands his ground and forfeits the

33:17.480 --> 33:18.480
follow.

33:18.480 --> 33:22.300
Now it looks like James has dealt with animators too much, you'd probably roll over the opportunity

33:22.300 --> 33:25.880
to get that follow if they just listened to his indirect advice.

33:25.880 --> 33:29.720
Tom is not that sort of person, you clearly didn't watch his Keemstar video, and in

33:29.720 --> 33:34.080
fact I spoke with someone briefly afterwards who had the exact same experience.

33:34.080 --> 33:37.960
They got unfollowed because they put out a mean tweet towards an animator, and then received

33:37.960 --> 33:39.480
the follow when they deleted it.

33:39.480 --> 33:44.320
It's pretty shady leverage being operated, but above all it's just rather immature,

33:44.320 --> 33:47.440
and immature is something that seems to pop up a lot.

33:47.440 --> 33:51.800
After speaking to some people, we kinda agreed that James doesn't necessarily seem like

33:51.800 --> 33:55.900
an unpleasant person, just someone who's never had to deal with a negative image being

33:55.900 --> 33:59.820
portrayed of him, so is just oblivious of how to respond.

33:59.820 --> 34:04.300
Another huge problem is that James and generally the animation community seem to value words

34:04.300 --> 34:08.620
more than action, something that is viewed differently not just in the commentary sphere

34:08.620 --> 34:11.740
but in the general YouTube sphere from what I've seen recently.

34:11.740 --> 34:16.340
We like to ask what something can say about their character rather than just holding items

34:16.340 --> 34:17.720
without context.

34:17.720 --> 34:22.140
But there is still a more glaring point than this, at heart.

34:22.140 --> 34:27.860
TheOdd1sOut has 8 million big fuck off subscribers, why on earth would he care about a commentator

34:27.860 --> 34:29.840
and what he says about some community?

34:29.840 --> 34:31.140
Why would it affect him?

34:31.140 --> 34:33.860
Why would he want to bind his critics?

34:36.860 --> 34:41.060
To respond to my question I just posed, I think this sentence from something else's

34:41.060 --> 34:43.060
video sums it up quite well.

34:43.060 --> 34:47.060
I mean as Jaden said, yeah, we all really depend on each other and actually help each

34:47.060 --> 34:48.660
other behind the scenes.

34:48.660 --> 34:52.980
Everyone really cares about helping themselves, that's fine, and it is definitely reflected

34:52.980 --> 34:54.660
in how they defend each other.

34:54.660 --> 34:58.980
However, if they are defending a community that will eventually be infiltrated by bad

34:58.980 --> 35:03.060
actors, they will have a lot harder of a job retaining that audience, because when

35:03.060 --> 35:06.320
you live as a collective, you die as a collective.

35:06.320 --> 35:10.300
They are collectivists, which works great when everyone is winning and getting loads

35:10.300 --> 35:11.540
of views.

35:11.540 --> 35:15.980
But as the Ted Talk revealed, all it takes is one bad taker getting out of hand to fuck

35:15.980 --> 35:16.980
it all up.

35:16.980 --> 35:20.740
Let's go right back to the start of the video, I spoke about old animation and how

35:20.740 --> 35:22.500
it had a sharp downfall.

35:22.500 --> 35:26.080
Many of these YouTubers who I've spoken about today are probably those who are most

35:26.080 --> 35:27.080
aware of it.

35:27.080 --> 35:31.460
Obviously, as an animator, many of them probably grew up amongst people who inspired them but

35:31.460 --> 35:32.960
fell foul to the algorithm.

35:32.960 --> 35:37.120
A few of the YouTubers within the genre have even alluded to the algorithm, these guys

35:37.120 --> 35:41.520
are not stupid and they understand how much of a prominent part it plays in their lives.

35:41.520 --> 35:45.400
In case you haven't noticed, they tend to collaborate a lot, and they almost certainly

35:45.400 --> 35:46.400
talk to each other.

35:46.400 --> 35:50.400
They've really created a collectivist community that seeks to benefit them all at once.

35:50.400 --> 35:54.600
As YouTubers, they also witness the downfall of people like Leafy and how a brief bump

35:54.600 --> 35:58.600
can begin a domino effect that subsequently destroys the channel, and given the fact a

35:58.600 --> 36:03.560
lot of animators have created this codependency, if one of them was to fall flat it could subsequently

36:03.560 --> 36:04.960
knock a load of them.

36:04.960 --> 36:09.180
So the odd ones out interest and involvement in this topic and those who criticise it suddenly

36:09.180 --> 36:11.040
becomes a lot more understandable.

36:11.040 --> 36:15.720
And I do empathise with his approach, but it doesn't justify the actions always being

36:15.720 --> 36:19.880
taken, nor does it change the fact that there are certain conclusions that can be drawn

36:19.880 --> 36:20.880
from this behaviour.

36:21.240 --> 36:25.200
This is why people do care about the fact that many respond to criticism badly.

36:25.200 --> 36:28.400
As I said, there's a watering hole, and where there's a watering hole, there'll be people

36:28.400 --> 36:30.040
attempting to poison it.

36:30.040 --> 36:34.580
And in fact, I think the collectivist nature definitely poses the question, what happens

36:34.580 --> 36:36.240
when something worse happens?

36:36.240 --> 36:37.240
Because it will.

36:37.240 --> 36:40.620
What happens when someone undesirable gets amongst the pack?

36:40.620 --> 36:42.060
What if it's happening already?

36:42.060 --> 36:44.980
What if it's already happened and it's just been swept under the rug?

36:44.980 --> 36:46.120
How do you deal with that?

36:46.120 --> 36:50.140
Because although what we've discussed today mainly centres around qualms, and a fair amount

36:50.140 --> 36:54.200
of them which could be considered trivial, their response and subsequent philosophy seems

36:54.200 --> 36:58.900
to breed an environment of potential for exploitation, and for all we know it may have already occurred,

36:58.900 --> 37:02.880
I mean you look at things like Me Too and you see how easy it is to conceal things that

37:02.880 --> 37:05.760
seem so unbelievably obvious in hindsight.

37:05.760 --> 37:08.980
That's a conceptual comparison by the way, I'm not suggesting that there are any sexual

37:08.980 --> 37:12.780
criminals within that community, though obviously the truth is out there somewhere.

37:12.780 --> 37:17.200
Given a lot of the criticism revolves around how these storytime animators have conducted

37:17.200 --> 37:23.180
themselves outside of videos, and sometimes even in private, it raises a real question,

37:23.180 --> 37:26.660
the dangerous difference between a public and private persona, and people like Darth

37:26.660 --> 37:30.980
Pinya are growing and their criticism is considered more validated because people are beginning

37:30.980 --> 37:35.140
to realise that these friendly, supposedly more open commentators behind the scenes may

37:35.140 --> 37:39.260
not be any more trustworthy than the previous generation that had been purged.

37:39.260 --> 37:42.740
And bring it back to the original comment, that's what happens when you have a formula,

37:42.740 --> 37:47.140
that's what happens when people realise that all you need is this persona, with some deviations

37:47.140 --> 37:51.020
maybe, and sure there are people who definitely stand out from that, but if anyone can make

37:51.020 --> 37:55.960
it using that, then the community will be infiltrated, Fox Goodman is not the first,

37:55.960 --> 38:00.080
and he is certainly not the last, and as soon as it's been shown that anyone can do that,

38:00.080 --> 38:02.760
then the whole concept becomes dubious to audiences.

38:02.760 --> 38:07.200
Now once again, people will always act on the notion of innocent until proven guilty,

38:07.200 --> 38:11.060
and I think that's the right thing to do, however that protective shield of premise

38:11.060 --> 38:15.860
alone just is not there anymore, the animation community is built on the foundations that

38:15.860 --> 38:21.300
depend on each other, on interdependency and interdependency, interdependency because

38:21.300 --> 38:26.140
their personas are composed of many components of purity which set such a high bar that any

38:26.140 --> 38:30.720
contradiction could cause that image to deteriorate, and interdependency and the fact that they

38:30.720 --> 38:35.520
rely on each other to benefit the algorithm, therefore they need to equally preserve themselves

38:35.520 --> 38:36.520
and each other.

38:36.520 --> 38:42.160
And when things happen like this, it foreshadows something, and people are not reacting just

38:42.160 --> 38:46.520
to what has happened, which is what the animators seem to wrongly construe, they're reacting

38:46.520 --> 38:50.480
to the implications, they're reacting to the character narratives, they're reacting to

38:50.480 --> 38:54.980
the possibilities in the future, and although the collective approach may benefit those

38:54.980 --> 38:59.840
when it is successful, it will be highly detrimental when the pressure sets in and some creators

38:59.840 --> 39:00.840
buckle.

39:00.840 --> 39:02.640
Human nature dictates that.

39:02.640 --> 39:06.920
Every community will have its due date, you can't stop an image being somewhat stained,

39:06.920 --> 39:11.540
you can postpone it, but you cannot prevent it, and by making your content more intertwined

39:11.620 --> 39:16.220
all you do is make it more susceptible when that day finally comes, when you represent

39:16.220 --> 39:20.060
each other at your best, you represent each other at your worst.

39:20.060 --> 39:26.020
There is a mix of hypocrisy, hubris, and even a touch of hysteria, but we can only look

39:26.020 --> 39:30.300
currently from the observation deck, who knows what's going on behind the scenes.

39:30.300 --> 39:35.340
I highly doubt that many of these people I've spoken about today are bad, in fact very few.

39:35.340 --> 39:39.240
When you've spoken to people, and when you yourself have suffered at the hands of systems

39:39.240 --> 39:43.240
structured no different to the one being established within storytime animation, it

39:43.240 --> 39:47.640
becomes difficult to defend, especially when wrongdoings are being committed, and many

39:47.640 --> 39:51.800
people who likely have experienced that too will wake up to the concept.

39:51.800 --> 39:56.000
When you have an accessible community, like any, you have the good and the bad, but the

39:56.000 --> 40:00.280
animation community seems set on only showing the good and hiding the bad, which is kind

40:00.280 --> 40:04.960
of ironic as people kind of turn to the community to address their own imperfections, and as

40:04.960 --> 40:08.700
commentators like the ones we've spoken about today force open the doors they will

40:08.740 --> 40:13.740
show more and more cracks that we previously glossed over, and people's opinions will change.

40:13.740 --> 40:15.700
If I were them, would I be concerned?

40:15.700 --> 40:19.400
I don't know, maybe they're just paranoid, but I might consider changing my behaviour

40:19.400 --> 40:25.620
towards those outside the community, something isn't better just because it takes more effort.

40:25.620 --> 40:29.460
To summarise, when your community becomes accessible to less than talented creators,

40:29.460 --> 40:34.380
and when an easy formula is in place then it's only a matter of time before the negative

40:34.380 --> 40:39.380
starts to flow in, at which point many audiences will look to you to oust those people, however

40:39.380 --> 40:43.620
with the attitudes adopted by the creators they seem to have a problem with that, at

40:43.620 --> 40:47.900
which point the audience will lose that core faith in the creator, and the genre will subsequently

40:47.900 --> 40:52.620
perish, and given how you set the standards, you're not going to make it easy for yourselves.

40:52.620 --> 40:57.160
A genre itself can never be the good guy, and the animators may be able to outrun the

40:57.160 --> 41:01.780
characters in their stories, may be able to outrun the fat kid, but they can't outrun

41:01.780 --> 41:06.460
criticism, they can't outrun the algorithm, and they sure as hell can't outrun me.

41:06.460 --> 41:07.460
The right opinion.

42:06.460 --> 42:34.980
You can't think of anything else to say, I hope everyone as well, I as always appreciate

42:34.980 --> 42:41.240
the support, the very passionate support, it is why I carry on doing this, I really

42:41.240 --> 42:45.740
could have taken a break now, it's the start of the university year and I want to carry

42:45.740 --> 42:50.720
on, I spoke to my parents and they said James, carry on your YouTube, see what you can do,

42:50.720 --> 42:56.180
and so here I am sat here recording another one in a fucking mess of a desk slash mini

42:56.180 --> 43:03.100
recording studio, which is barely, barely workable, but with enough perseverance it

43:03.100 --> 43:04.220
may just pay off.

43:04.220 --> 43:09.220
