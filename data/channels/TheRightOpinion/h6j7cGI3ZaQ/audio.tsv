0	9320	What if the world you knew wasn't as it was?
9320	29000	What if all the people, the names, the faces, the emotions, were not real?
29000	41000	What if your idols were just blueprints?
59000	84840	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
84840	85840	too much free time.
85840	91600	And something told me this had to be done, today we talk about story time, animators.
91600	95640	And it came from an interesting source, you see I have goodfellas who's content I support
95640	98760	and so I'm going to drop it a view and send them some constructive feedback.
98760	103440	The video I decided to check out on the 17th of August 2018, was Turkey Tom's video
103440	104600	on animators.
104600	108960	It was a fine enough video, there was definitely insight and information revealed, and I'll
108960	112080	leave it in the description below if you want to go and see it for yourself.
112080	115640	However there was one comment that specifically caught my attention, and it's a passing
115640	133520	one really.
133520	138120	Yes an aside comment about the personas adopted by story time animators, admittedly a genre
138120	142600	that I don't have that much interest in, gave me a simple lightbulb moment.
142600	143840	What is that lightbulb moment?
143840	146800	Well you'll have to be patient, because right now we're going to provide a little
146800	151460	synopsis of what the animation community is, because I'm sure many of you may be unfamiliar
151460	153520	with this swelling group of creators.
153520	157240	To understand the evolution we need to go back a few years, because there was a time
157240	163000	when animation was all over YouTube, it was inescapable, a range of unique creators converging
163000	167600	in this place that supported their individuality, YouTube was almost custom made for it, the
167600	171800	idea that people were expressing themselves, that's what YouTube was all about, and
171800	175720	their effort was being rewarded in one of the most fulfilling ways possible.
175720	180040	In the early days, animators focused mainly on a distinct style to find themselves, in
180040	183840	a video reflecting on this, Quinton reviews depicted the intricate style that each of
183840	184840	them took.
184840	188040	I won't repeat what he said, but in the early days of YouTube there were many creators
188040	192800	who really set themselves apart using information, and you know what, I liked it a lot.
192800	196700	Even though it wasn't as direct and to the point as many other videos, you could see
196700	201980	what was being expressed through the cartoons, personally I'm a big fan of show not tell
201980	205240	storytelling, and even if the stuff seems shallow on the surface, when you broke a lot
205240	209620	of it down, it seemed to reveal interesting layers, and that stuff really rocked the boat
209620	211400	of YouTube.
211400	213740	But then, it just stopped.
213740	216780	I'm sure many of you will know the story, but to those who don't, YouTube run a range
216780	221260	of algorithms that decide whether a genre lives or dies, and whether they decide it
221260	225300	wasn't profitable enough, or just the views began to dip a tad, YouTube decide to pull
225300	229820	the plug, and these animators were left in the dark.
229820	234100	Many moons passed and the sun seemed set on those in the animation genre, no gaps really
234100	239200	opened up, YouTube felt like a different place than therefore was documented by many, however
239200	242580	by 2016 there was a new gap in the market.
242580	246660	2016 was an interesting year, not just for YouTube but for people, we were moving into
246660	251140	a more volatile area, there was an era of cynicism, but one thing I'd say in particular
251140	254620	was that people were becoming more aware, aware of the world around them, aware of the
254620	258820	tactics being used by people who were previously trusted, people no longer sought after those
258820	263560	who pandered to their sympathies, it was a real shift in mentality across the spectrum,
263560	267860	and that awareness of the world around them led to an equally increased awareness of self.
267860	272100	It led to a more brooding generation, a set of people looking more inside themselves rather
272100	276460	than looking for exterior validation from the previous set of superficial creators,
276460	280440	and through this rose a very interesting genre known as storytime animation.
280440	284060	Most people here will probably know the odd ones out who was one of the real pioneers
284060	288480	of the genre, at the turn of 2016 he had little more than 10,000 subscribers, yet by
288480	291260	the end he had over 2 million.
291260	292260	Why though?
292260	295700	Well his content reflected the landscape that I just described you, when looking inside
295700	299140	themselves people found insecurities, things that they wanted to change, and no longer
299140	303180	did they look to these fake smiley vloggers, just gloss over it and show the nice bright
303180	307060	side of everything, they wanted people who would put in that sort of self reflection
307060	308340	into their content.
308340	311740	Now it's not like the vloggers and other content didn't try to put deep moments in
311740	315900	their videos but it was almost always given a contrived gloss or stuck at the end of a
315900	319300	video in which they went out and bought a new Bentley for their second cousin.
319300	322340	It was hard to relate to struggles, that's what I'm saying, particularly when they
322340	326500	were presented in a way that we didn't see them inside ourselves, however by reflecting
326500	330340	on the past the odd ones out tapped into an authenticity, whereas the former class of
330340	334120	vloggers took general struggles and made them personalised, the odd ones out reversed that
334120	339000	formula and took the humdrum of everyday life and presented them in a light that made people
339000	344440	think this guy gets me, he took his own individual situations and tinted them in a timeless sentiment
344440	348960	that appealed to the current generation of our introspective youth, I respect him for
348960	349960	that.
349960	354280	As I've said before I went to VidCon 2018 this year, it gave me lots of individual epiphanies,
354280	357720	moments that just stuck out in my head, one of those was the moment when I was passing
357720	361600	through the merch stands and I remember feeling kinda weird when I saw the merchandising for
361600	365100	Jaiden animations and the odd ones out, just a discomfort.
365100	369060	My logic soon kicked in overriding this gut instinct, at the end of the day, anyone who
369060	373140	has that following should be completely allowed to sell merch, after all, their fans want
373140	377260	to support it too, but it did make me wonder, when something like their content, content
377260	381260	that seems so wholesome and grassroots in their appeal, that speaks to people as sometimes
381260	385840	their most vulnerable, could be taken advantage of and transformed into a cash cow, how long
385840	389360	is it until the wrong sort of people try to jump on the bandwagon?
389360	393560	And that brings us back to our quote, today we will discuss a plethora of questions, why
393560	397160	the animation community is unique in a way, but at the same time how that could both damage
397160	400800	their reputation and make them susceptible to criticism, the problems with their often
400800	404680	dismissive and passive aggressive responses to their critics, and how that for many viewers
404680	409260	foreshadows a worrisome trend noticed in many YouTube genres before it, and perhaps leading
409260	410880	them to the same fate.
410880	416120	So without further ado, I suggest we cut into this spicy piece, let's get to it.
427120	431640	Lack of authenticity has been a problem endemic to YouTube, what is remotely different about
431640	433120	this situation?
433120	437100	Well let's explain that, you see content creators like vloggers may have been disingenuous,
437100	441760	in fact fuck it of course they were disingenuous, but they seldom sold it as anything else,
441760	445420	everyone knew that it wasn't exactly them, and when they did it, it wasn't the crux
445420	450340	of their channel, it wasn't the core appeal, it was just an outlet to their forever dramatising
450340	454420	forced personality, which I have laid into multiple times at this point.
454420	458620	However with these story time animators, it is them, this is who they are, and the struggles
458620	462020	influence their character and the interaction they have with their followers, and that's
462020	465980	important it's not something you should take advantage of, equally it means that in
465980	470220	the genre they set the bar incredibly high for conduct, they can't behave like Joey
470220	473980	Salads because they present themselves as better, and you can tell that they believe
473980	474980	it.
474980	478660	So why are we still talking about the way they respond to criticism, and why does it
478660	479660	matter?
479660	482700	When documenting the original set of animators, Quinton reviews really showed how each of
482700	486380	these individuals had their own personality, channeled through their art, and the beauty
486380	490500	that it really created, and so when the clip that we observed in the Turkey Tom video was
490500	494900	played, it sent up some red flags, how can you summarise a premise of a genre in one
494900	495900	sentence?
495900	498740	The reason I left out the whole sentiment of his video, whether proven or not, was that
498740	501660	there were creators out there who had real trouble taking criticism.
501660	505240	Now obviously it depends on how that criticism is delivered, you're not going to engage
505240	509300	in someone who's rude or attempts to snidely undermine you, however given the behaviour
509300	513340	of some of these animators, when someone makes fairly passable comments, and you react with
513340	517420	great volatility, then it could be a sign of insecurity, I know commentators who are
517420	521540	very aware that the current content they're creating is some part of their ability, it
521540	528120	is written all over their attitude, and I've read it.
528120	532700	Now insecurity isn't always a sign of mal-intent, someone may just be socially anxious, however
532700	536540	it is definitely cause for further investigation, and that's what we're going to be doing
536540	537540	today.
537540	540900	It's also important to note that another YouTuber, Darth Pinya, has done multiple videos
540900	544740	covering the individual YouTubers, and I would definitely recommend checking out some of
544740	549540	his videos, however today we may use certain individual YouTubers as exemplars, but the
549540	553540	greater point will be made discussing the culture that surrounds the genre, and why
553540	557060	surface value innocence is lined with a sharp poison.
557060	562580	For storytime animators, people wanted to move away from the inauthentic superficiality,
562580	566320	so we looked for people to fill in the void of these new characters, characters that we
566320	570240	assessed as deeper, but if the trials and tribulations of these individuals are being
570240	574500	summed up so succinctly, then we might have a new problem on our hands, but at least let's
574500	579060	try to break the formula down into a few more sentences, and work out where the leverage
579060	581060	is being operated.
581060	585300	Now you must understand that due to my status as a prominent cynic, that I went into these
585300	589700	videos expecting to detest most to all of them, nonetheless I watched the old ones out
589700	594620	and came to the realisation that his content was actually pretty great, not anything necessarily
594620	599180	that I would watch, just not really my style, but he was a pretty compelling creator, sometimes
599180	603860	the pioneer of a genre is retrospectively seen as actually a pretty average creator
603860	608700	who just struck gold with the topics, think Trigga Tro, Leafy and so on, not saying they're
608700	612380	bad exactly, but it's clear that there were better creators who knew how to utilise
612380	616860	their topics with more panache, however James here clearly actually has raw talent that
616860	620820	extends beyond the base formula, and so I was pleasantly surprised, his story said more
620820	625940	about himself than he needed to say explicitly, show not tell, he's mastered it, so props
625940	630060	to him for doing that, however I did not expect him to be the target of this video because
630060	634160	he was doing it before it was popular, and that's something that no uninspired leech
634160	635360	would ever do.
635360	639600	So from the old ones out, it inevitably seemed like it was going to go downhill, it wasn't
639600	643560	necessarily a sharp drop in quality though, there were just certain cracks that became
643560	647520	noticeable, that sent off signals that didn't endear me as a viewer, alongside watching
647520	651480	their content I watched Da Pinya's videos about the creators, not just as a monitor
651480	655880	to make sure I didn't miss anything, but also to see how they had responded, that can
655880	660960	be equally as revealing as the content itself, but let's talk about the appeal of the content.
660960	665120	I've spoken about this earlier, but a word I'm using a lot is authenticity, I think
665120	668880	it's safe to say that it is one of the key hooks of the storytime animator, these
668880	673640	people are living life, therefore there are two components that are central to these characters,
673640	677760	honesty and entertainment, if either of these were compromised the fans would be unlikely
677760	681440	to support the creator, what I like about the old ones out is that he manages to make
681440	685520	the mundane details interesting, and this is why in my opinion, he'll always be the
685520	686520	most successful.
686520	691560	This is not to say that no other individuals in this genre have the capability to be interesting,
691560	695180	they're actually completely the opposite, however their personalities in particular
695180	698920	and sometimes their humour seem to lack a pizzazz, in fact if you just stripped them
698920	703560	down to the core personality many of them wouldn't be interesting at all, so how do
703560	704900	you circumvent that?
704900	710020	What I found for many of these creators who may not be so recognisable on the personality
710020	714880	area was that they often used dramatised source material, dramatised source material isn't
714880	720000	a bad thing necessarily, though it gives the actual storyteller less work, coasting on
720000	722920	the crazy plot and clickbait titles.
722920	723920	Why is that?
723920	727280	Well you can't be boring while presenting it as entertaining, because at that point
727280	731920	it just becomes entertaining, but you can be dishonest while presenting it as honest,
731920	736060	you can't really answer the question of whether these things happened or not, nor
736060	740560	can you pick out specific events, but eventually with the clickbait and the sort of embellishment
740560	744360	that I observed, I began to feel like some of the videos were just Tarnamon Goose on
744360	749320	paper, just with a bit more personality, which is obviously welcome, but it's not impossible
749320	753360	to tell stories, so I don't really rate that alone, once again you can't prove it
753360	757080	as fake, but it's understandable to be sceptical of the idea that all of these people
757080	761440	with such a backlog of interesting stories remembered so well in their memory, down to
761440	766000	specific details have all converged in one community, hella fucking coincidence.
766000	771040	And in fact if you don't want me to spell it out to you, TerryTV Will, another youtuber
771040	775200	reached out to me saying he made a video on him that hadn't even accumulated 100 views
775200	780200	when good old Terry went on his little diatribe, for the record TerryTV is a trend hopper creator
780200	784480	who recently decided to jack storytime animation, and use the fact that he had mentioned that
784480	789760	his series were exaggerated as a defence for exaggerating, fair point of course, until
789760	794120	you dig further and realise that he only announced it was exaggerated in the last two minutes
794120	798360	of the final video of the series, after an unofficial outro.
798360	802080	I know a lot of you guys have been asking in the comments if these stories are true,
802080	807640	the answer is yes, to an extent, they are based off of my life, but as some of you guessed
807640	812200	in the comments, yes, some things that happened in the story were exaggerated a little bit
812200	815680	just for comedic effect, or just to make the story a little more interesting.
815680	820600	And after, he'd accumulated over 2 million views, kinda like me conducting a series of
820600	825380	pranks and then declaring them fake in my final video after reaping the sweet ad revenue.
825380	828320	He said he wanted to address the claims, but I wonder why he didn't address them at the
828320	830400	end of the second video at least.
830400	834600	In fact, TerryTV seems quite sure that he made it so obvious that it was exaggerated,
834600	838680	which does make me wonder why he even cares about someone calling him out for it.
838680	843040	It's Hollywood guys, storytime animators are Hollywood, put that quote on a wall lads,
843040	847120	I'm sure that's exactly what people like the odd ones out want to hear.
847120	851520	Now make no mistake, TerryTV is a trend hopper, and his movement to animation is the perfect
851520	854480	embodiment of what we're going to be talking about today.
854480	858640	In a recent video, Darkpina very briefly showed that somehow a YouTuber had managed to expose
858640	862740	himself as faking his stories, as this guy who had two accounts, Fox Goodman and Matt
862740	867160	Spicer had released two videos on the same subject, both telling different stories.
867160	871120	The fact that in a discrete environment, someone has nonetheless managed to show themselves
871120	874600	as falsifying stories should say how easy it actually is.
874600	879560	The problem is beyond the concept and combination of animation, the content exists on a spectrum,
879560	883040	it's easy to see the difference between the best and worst creators.
883040	887680	This is fine, in fact, clip baiting, telling exaggerated stories, having lower quality
887720	892280	and even being emotionally manipulative in certain scenarios is not unreasonable, if
892280	896740	you are fairly lazy with your animations and it attains views then more power to you.
896740	901520	The point is that no genre is truly above criticism, you do not have the sole ability
901520	906360	to be better by any excuse, but the problem is that they seem to adopt this holier-than-thou
906360	910600	attitude when responding to criticism, because there are people who will take problems with
910600	913920	all of the things that I've just listed, and that's the simple fact of the moral
913920	917620	compass, some people view things as acceptable, other people don't.
917620	920060	What matters to the viewer, is consistency.
920060	924380	One of the points that I saw made from time to time was that because animation videos
924380	930340	as a basis take more effort than per se, Fortnite videos, thanks James, that you cannot call
930340	935140	animation lazy, because there are other genres of video that take less effort at their best
935140	937580	than animation at their worst.
937580	942080	Though James my friend, that is just subjective commentary, individuals are compared to others
942080	946320	within their own genre, because that's where the appeal lies, however under the precipice
946320	950200	of content superiority, this bizarre standard has been adopted.
950200	953880	Let me ask you this, is Beethoven's 5th better than Lose Yourself because it took
953880	955680	longer or more effort?
955680	957280	Does it not want criticism?
957280	961940	No, because an unbelievably high amount of effort is assumed in the premise of the former,
961940	965920	it does not push the genre of orchestral symphonies above criticism.
965920	970740	You can defend a genre from criticism on its own, you can defend an individual creator
970740	975600	from criticism on its own, but to use a genre to create an umbrella defense for all its
975600	980260	animators is a fallacy of division, assuming all components are good because the greater
980260	981840	product is good.
981840	986220	This partly explains why until the last month, storytime animators seldom receive the same
986220	990760	level of scrutiny as other communities, but there's also more to say about that.
990760	994820	With storytime animators, everything is drenched in a level of emotional depth that makes it
994820	999120	hard to criticise, everyone seems more wholesome, if you criticise them, you're criticising
999120	1003320	a character that has developed more intricate relationships with the audiences, and you
1003320	1005440	do feel bad for criticising that.
1005440	1010500	However, regardless of the level of effort in videos, every creator should be open to
1010500	1016680	some level of criticism, no matter how fantastic their character is, talking down their content
1016680	1020100	or argumentative points is never off the table.
1026680	1030140	In case it hasn't been discussed enough already, some of these creators do not like
1030140	1034760	receiving criticism themselves, in fact their response in certain instances has been bemusing,
1034760	1039100	whether it was dismissing it as subjective commentary, blocking individuals, or downloading
1039100	1044360	a video so as to not give a creator the views, that last one is truly hilarious because of
1044360	1045720	the effort it requires.
1045720	1050840	None of my points previous are trying to show the animators as quote bad human beings, however
1050840	1055320	the self-appointed sanctity that they give themselves is rather unfounded, as undoubtedly
1055320	1059800	many of them participate in the same behaviours that any other non-animation YouTube genre
1059800	1064440	has profited from, if someone chooses to criticise them for that, the fact that its animation
1064440	1065960	doesn't absolve them.
1065960	1069380	The reason why some of them do have trouble responding to criticism is something known
1069380	1073760	as the good guy complex, the fact that whether these people are good or bad within the community,
1073760	1077920	they have developed such an idea focused around being the protagonist, the criticism against
1077920	1081320	them is seen as unjustified because of their greater morality.
1081320	1086200	This is something we have encountered constantly on numerous occasions, from Greg Paul to Fouseytube,
1086200	1090240	the idea that there is a greater good that justifies the little mishaps.
1090240	1094560	Although their attitude is harder to point out as they don't explicitly say it, often
1094560	1098240	it's just little side references where you know you've gotten under their skin.
1121200	1125200	Most of these demonstrate animators setting up strawmen over how their criticism is delivered
1125200	1130400	and then telling their fans that these ridiculous ideas are not worth engaging with, while implying
1130400	1133040	some generality in the idea of these critics.
1133040	1138000	Probably one of the best examples of this was when something else YT made a video titled
1138000	1146240	Ripoffs, in which he decided to define ripoffs before explaining why he couldn't be his
1146240	1156640	own definition of ripoff, which yes, he's not directly copying or plagiarising, but
1156640	1160840	I feel those claiming he was a quote ripoff were referring to the second definition in
1160840	1169360	the dictionary, you know the inferior imitation one, and although you may be past that stage,
1169360	1171120	I understand what people were saying.
1171120	1175120	He then goes on to say that no one owns a style, and although true in this situation
1175120	1179640	it doesn't really contradict the idea of ripoffs existing, no one was trying to sue
1179640	1180640	you.
1180640	1184160	He then follows this by saying that because Let's Play YouTubers regularly play the same
1184160	1189400	game and have the same style of editing and are not considered ripoffs, he can't be considered
1189400	1191080	a ripoff either.
1191080	1197600	So let me rephrase this logical fallacy for everyone to understand how ridiculous it is.
1197600	1203100	Because one artist draws with a pencil and another artist draws with a pencil and neither
1203100	1208460	are ripping off each other, then if one artist's style resembles the other, then that cannot
1208460	1209940	be a ripoff either.
1209940	1212280	Sounds a bit silly now, doesn't it?
1212280	1220540	On top of that he said, in fact it's all fine because he has a different personality.
1220540	1225380	Suddenly to this creator, design seems much less a factor, but he seems more offended
1225380	1229540	at the idea that people were judging him above all, however the tone of the specific video
1229540	1237360	is what caught my attention.
1237360	1242420	One of enlightenment, there are a lot of stupid people in this world and something else YT
1242420	1248180	here is going to sit you all down and provide you with an education free of charge.
1248180	1249420	How kind.
1249420	1254740	He is an animator, and because he is an animator and he doesn't directly copy, then to call
1254740	1258500	him a ripoff is the most audacious thing you could do.
1258500	1262700	What I'm trying to say is that many of these creators almost seem offended at the idea
1262700	1267160	that they could be perceived as anything else than what they want their audience to see
1267160	1271300	them as, even when it's trivial things like ripoffs.
1271300	1276020	Some may argue that there is no credible argument against such things like clickbait or faking
1276020	1281020	and exaggerating stories and even ripping off when it's commonplace on YouTube.
1281020	1285020	Let me tell you, I've come across a few right opinion clones in my time, although not an
1285020	1288780	unreasonable argument, I think the fact that storytime YouTubers base their appeal and
1288780	1293020	build relationships, and subsequently profit off the trust and authenticity that their
1293020	1298380	content pervades, does mean that if a commentator wants to contradict that, to show up an element
1298380	1303140	that their audience may not have seen before, that may alter their perception, then they
1303140	1305160	equally have a right to do so.
1305160	1310540	And if the animators want to act holier than thou, then they're going to be held to holier
1310540	1312420	than thou standards.
1312420	1314500	They did this to themselves.
1314500	1319420	And judging by the little things, when researching through Da Pinya's videos, it's clear that
1319420	1324500	a few of them have felt guilty about things they've done, one of the minor very telling
1324500	1330740	changes was the removal of the featuring odd ones out credit on Tim Toms video title, which
1330740	1332140	blew him up.
1332140	1337180	After all, putting features when they barely feature is seen by some as marginally objectionable,
1337180	1341300	and given how sometimes they've complained about it, I understand why.
1341300	1346980	However, you cannot deny the past, it still happened, and you still did it that way.
1346980	1350640	If you think that might contradict your image, well, you should have thought about that before.
1350640	1354140	The problem is, with their success, there are always people looking to profit off it
1354140	1358320	without the same heart, without the same intentions as you, the good guy.
1358320	1361300	And even as the good guy, you might make mistakes.
1361300	1364620	It doesn't mean just because you're a good guy that you shouldn't be held to account
1364620	1365620	on them.
1365620	1369380	Almost every community is one that will have good creators and bad creators, good people
1369380	1370380	and bad people.
1370460	1374420	A clip from Tim Toms shows him expressing how everyone in the animation community is
1374420	1376660	just so wonderful.
1376660	1382140	You see in online communities, there's a lot of vitriol, a lot of anger, a lot of hatred.
1382140	1387840	And what I've found with the animation community on YouTube is that that couldn't be farther
1387840	1388840	from the truth.
1388840	1392940	But I don't agree with that, though I do understand why he perceives it that way.
1392940	1397660	The problem with the animation community is that the stock persona is inherently good,
1397660	1402500	deep and likeable, and the little exaggerations are very subtle, so it becomes impossible
1402500	1406820	to distinguish between those who are positive givers and helpful people, and those who are
1406820	1411740	sucking out the energy of the community, those who may be participating in disingenuous practices,
1411740	1414900	or those who are taking advantage of the kindness of others.
1414900	1418900	It all becomes indistinguishable, which is rather dangerous for a community, because
1418900	1422900	as a creator or as a viewer, you no longer know who to truly trust, you either put your
1422900	1426000	faith in everyone, or you play your cards very carefully.
1426000	1430200	Without catering to too many memes, there's this great Ted Talk, which discusses the concept
1430200	1433840	of givers and takers, I'll leave it in the pinned comment though it may be among other
1433840	1437400	links so you might have to control efforts, type in Ted or something.
1437400	1440800	But obviously takers are people who always contribute the least while wanting to take
1440800	1445640	the most, and there are also those who cater into the agreeable and disagreeable factions.
1445640	1450320	The problem is the existence of agreeable takers, those who behave nicely while still
1450320	1452320	taking advantage of others around them.
1452320	1457600	To be successful in the animation community, your persona has to be inherently agreeable,
1457600	1462340	so regardless of if you're a giver, taker, or a matcher, people cannot tell the difference.
1462340	1466280	To suggest that through chance there has been this utopian community created where everyone
1466280	1471640	who tries for success are just fantastic human beings, to me, and probably to many others,
1471640	1475920	would be delusional, and it's only a matter of time until the leeches begin to pile on.
1475920	1479880	And this is where everything comes full circle, because where there is success, there is a
1479880	1480880	formula.
1480880	1485040	There is the community circle, people want something more original, more organic, however
1485040	1489360	as soon as people realise the opportunity, and as soon as the formula became clearer,
1489360	1495240	and use that nature to create personas, that wholesome appeal will be undermined, and the
1495240	1499580	flaws will start to show, even for the best.
1499580	1503560	Eventually it's only a matter of time until people start to point out the flaws, that
1503560	1507120	something's polluted and you can't run away from it, the problem is that publicly, it's
1507120	1511920	very difficult to tell who's real and who's fake, but it won't stop people from trying,
1511920	1516120	and so when responding to this, they have to keep this in mind, that the person who's
1516120	1519320	criticised them may make some very compelling points.
1519320	1524960	However, in this instance behind the agreeable facade lies a much more chronic problem.
1524960	1535160	So recently, in spite of the absence of abhorrent scandals, they still have been receiving a
1535160	1537240	significant amount of criticism.
1537240	1538240	Why is that?
1538240	1542280	They do seem to have the belief that they know their community better than me, which
1542280	1545400	is probably true, but I know human nature better than them.
1545400	1548840	You see, I've watched a lot of videos and seen a lot of legitimate criticism levelled
1548840	1552480	against these creators, and I've levelled a lot of criticism which I think is fair,
1552480	1555800	not just current but speculative, but I don't think they'll be acknowledged because of their
1555800	1558160	nature to respond in an interesting manner.
1558160	1560640	We're going to fall back to the Something Else YT video.
1560640	1564600	So I left this final part out of his response to the allegations against him that he was
1564600	1567120	a rip-off because they're most relevant here.
1567120	1571800	Basically, he not only says himself, but he features Jayden Animations, another YouTuber,
1571800	1575660	to say he's not ripping off anyone and they don't mind because they're there to help each
1575660	1576660	other out.
1576660	1582000	So writing mean comments calling people rip-offs is not helpful at all to the community.
1582000	1583320	The greater good.
1583320	1587720	And this is a problem, the storytime animation community sees themselves as one huge collective
1587720	1592040	as they all note on multiple occasions stepping on each other's toes would be disastrous for
1592040	1598540	the algorithm, or THE ALGORITHM as some like to brand it, so it only makes sense that they
1598540	1599840	help each other out.
1599840	1603120	On top of this it means defending each other which is something that they have done on
1603120	1606840	multiple occasions, they all seem to be in a consensual business friendship with each
1606840	1611120	other, if someone's leeching a bit then that's alright because even if they do it helps everyone
1611120	1614600	out, using tags for views, sure, go for it.
1614600	1617920	That's all good but you can't be surprised if someone calls you out for it, and saying
1617920	1621980	that it's all alright because everyone in the specific context was fine with it just
1621980	1624740	won't wash with many people, why is that?
1624740	1629680	Because it doesn't contradict a greater narrative that may be implied about their character,
1629680	1633600	and that's why the criticism against animation has been slowly grown, because in spite of
1633600	1638520	their half responses they never work out how to actually contradict the narrative.
1638520	1642320	Sometimes if you consent to something that could be perceived as bad, instead of cancelling
1642320	1646760	the narrative it actually just extends to you as well, though it depends on the context
1646760	1647760	of course.
1647800	1651520	Jaden is perfectly embodied in Darth Pinya's content, a lot of his previous videos never
1651520	1655520	gained much traction, because although his greater narrative contradicted the image that
1655520	1660120	the storytime animation community tried to emulate, he never successfully disproved it,
1660120	1664840	and in some instances he even received quite severe criticism such as his video on Jaden
1664840	1668760	Animations, a video which I feel was quite misguided in its points.
1677760	1682320	However with the recent drama slowly escalating, harsher criticism and more intense videos
1682320	1687040	documenting more universally agreed wrongdoings such as tracing, neglect of credit to artists
1687040	1691600	and just complete deflection of criticism on the back of simply awful reasoning, people's
1691600	1695960	minds will slowly be changed, and every single one of his videos on that topic has slowly
1695960	1700680	gained more credibility, and people will begin to doubt the rhetoric espoused by many others
1700680	1702360	in defence of these creators.
1702360	1706880	The reason is because the idea of just permitting it within the community exists beyond an inner
1706880	1711760	circle, people begin to see how if kept up this could create disingenuous characters
1711760	1716720	who not just exploit those within their circle but those outside, artists, fans and so on,
1716720	1718600	it's probably happened already.
1718600	1722000	People don't like the idea of that, people don't like the thought that they'd be
1722000	1726880	contributing to something like that, even if everyone in that specific scenario is in
1726880	1727880	support of it.
1727880	1732280	If I gave someone permission to stab me, and they stab me, would it necessarily absolve
1732280	1733280	them?
1733280	1737280	If anyone here has watched Hot Fuzz I compare the animation community to Sandford, the sort
1737280	1741520	of place that works so hard to keep a lovely image that it requires questionable action
1741520	1745640	sometimes to preserve it, and they can feel the pressure and the harder they try to defend
1745640	1749560	it the more I feel they have something to hide, and the more the cracks begin to show.
1749560	1753560	A really interesting example of this was when a YouTuber by the name of MangaKamen made
1753560	1757640	a response to Turkey Tom, the video was fair in many points, and it also brought up some
1757640	1761960	tweets that Tom had subsequently deleted that would have given more context to his video.
1761960	1765440	They were distasteful comments directed at someone's physical appearance, I am glad
1765440	1769240	he removed them, and subsequently was made to apologise over them, people shouldn't
1769240	1773240	just run away from these, and although I do have problems with the video I am almost certain
1773240	1778440	they will be mostly discussed out by other YouTubers at this point, including Tom himself.
1778440	1781560	Point is, his tweets were something that should have been included as a disclaimer given its
1781560	1785680	relevance, and as he hadn't publicly apologised for them it is credible that it served as
1785680	1789800	an alternative explanation for a server ban, and on top of that it looked like he was being
1789800	1793480	a dick in a public Discord server, I might have banned him too.
1793480	1797640	However no, what I found most interesting was the odd ones out's response in the comment
1797640	1798640	section.
1798640	1804960	Wow, I had no idea the stuff on Twitter happened, thanks for showing us, really makes me wonder
1804960	1810200	why Tom left it out of his video, I've been binging your videos for a while, I think they
1810200	1814320	are really good, I like that you have actual criticisms and bring up new things to the
1814320	1815320	conversation.
1815320	1818480	Well, James you're gonna love this next part.
1818480	1823360	I have sung my praises for the man, and his content, but this is where it ends for now.
1823360	1827400	James has no love for Tom and to be honest, if I were in his shoes I probably wouldn't
1827400	1828400	either.
1828400	1831520	But I don't like these comments, they're what I like to call an empty lead, it's a classic
1831520	1835680	rhetorical tactic used by people when they want to take credibility from their detractors
1835680	1839940	without giving them any way to respond to them, they firstly blow up whatever information
1839940	1845760	or react in an emphatic manner, saying something like wow, amazing, and then imply that something
1845760	1849600	worse must be behind it without explicitly saying what you're thinking.
1849600	1853760	Like what on earth do you mean makes you wonder, Cayman here just spent a whole fucking video
1853760	1855020	explaining it.
1855020	1858380	This is the most that James can really exert influence, any greater acknowledgement of
1858380	1862980	Turkey Tom would just be publicity for him, but my god does he try hard with everything
1862980	1863980	he has.
1863980	1868020	So I said to Tom in a group chat that it was a fair video on him, but what was with the
1868020	1870940	old ones out comments, and boy, there was more.
1870940	1874660	The old ones out had actually approached Tom and given him a whole lecture about the situation
1874660	1879880	and how the tweets, the specific tweets, had ruined his reputation, and could follow him
1879880	1882080	forever.
1882080	1892680	No, that's what you wanted to do.
1892680	1896140	It only vaguely compromised the points he made about the Discord server, everything
1896140	1898700	else was presented in videos before anyway.
1898700	1903160	And yes, as a joke it was poor form, but you're setting the bar pretty low if you believe
1903160	1908200	those sorts of jokes ruin reputations, considering it has been fairly prevalent in many YouTubers,
1908200	1935240	whether funny, or unfunny.
1935240	1938560	And yes, he was specifically referring to the tweets to see the question, now James
1938560	1951040	isn't stupid, and he knows that his mates have derided people's images in the past,
1951040	1955120	and that although the targeted nature in this instance definitely makes it worse, it's
1955120	1956120	not career ending.
1956120	1958800	So why on earth would he make such a song and dance about it?
1958800	1962760	Well to understand that we have to look at his second comment too, he was considering
1962760	1967100	following Tom, but now he can see that Tom is no one that he should be associating with.
1967100	1971880	That damn disgusting tweet is enough evidence to show that he is in fact a cretin, but if
1971880	1975880	you genuinely believe that, you wouldn't have said that, simple as.
1975880	1979740	No one says that if it's not on the table in those circumstances, in fact the follow
1979740	1984160	here is clearly being used to put Tom in a double bind, either Tom grovels for the follow
1984160	1988280	and admits that they were horrible and affirms James' implications about the comments and
1988280	1992720	subsequent reputational damages, allowing people to hold it over him and thus tainting
1992720	1997480	his future statements on the animation community, or Tom stands his ground and forfeits the
1997480	1998480	follow.
1998480	2002300	Now it looks like James has dealt with animators too much, you'd probably roll over the opportunity
2002300	2005880	to get that follow if they just listened to his indirect advice.
2005880	2009720	Tom is not that sort of person, you clearly didn't watch his Keemstar video, and in
2009720	2014080	fact I spoke with someone briefly afterwards who had the exact same experience.
2014080	2017960	They got unfollowed because they put out a mean tweet towards an animator, and then received
2017960	2019480	the follow when they deleted it.
2019480	2024320	It's pretty shady leverage being operated, but above all it's just rather immature,
2024320	2027440	and immature is something that seems to pop up a lot.
2027440	2031800	After speaking to some people, we kinda agreed that James doesn't necessarily seem like
2031800	2035900	an unpleasant person, just someone who's never had to deal with a negative image being
2035900	2039820	portrayed of him, so is just oblivious of how to respond.
2039820	2044300	Another huge problem is that James and generally the animation community seem to value words
2044300	2048620	more than action, something that is viewed differently not just in the commentary sphere
2048620	2051740	but in the general YouTube sphere from what I've seen recently.
2051740	2056340	We like to ask what something can say about their character rather than just holding items
2056340	2057720	without context.
2057720	2062140	But there is still a more glaring point than this, at heart.
2062140	2067860	TheOdd1sOut has 8 million big fuck off subscribers, why on earth would he care about a commentator
2067860	2069840	and what he says about some community?
2069840	2071140	Why would it affect him?
2071140	2073860	Why would he want to bind his critics?
2076860	2081060	To respond to my question I just posed, I think this sentence from something else's
2081060	2083060	video sums it up quite well.
2083060	2087060	I mean as Jaden said, yeah, we all really depend on each other and actually help each
2087060	2088660	other behind the scenes.
2088660	2092980	Everyone really cares about helping themselves, that's fine, and it is definitely reflected
2092980	2094660	in how they defend each other.
2094660	2098980	However, if they are defending a community that will eventually be infiltrated by bad
2098980	2103060	actors, they will have a lot harder of a job retaining that audience, because when
2103060	2106320	you live as a collective, you die as a collective.
2106320	2110300	They are collectivists, which works great when everyone is winning and getting loads
2110300	2111540	of views.
2111540	2115980	But as the Ted Talk revealed, all it takes is one bad taker getting out of hand to fuck
2115980	2116980	it all up.
2116980	2120740	Let's go right back to the start of the video, I spoke about old animation and how
2120740	2122500	it had a sharp downfall.
2122500	2126080	Many of these YouTubers who I've spoken about today are probably those who are most
2126080	2127080	aware of it.
2127080	2131460	Obviously, as an animator, many of them probably grew up amongst people who inspired them but
2131460	2132960	fell foul to the algorithm.
2132960	2137120	A few of the YouTubers within the genre have even alluded to the algorithm, these guys
2137120	2141520	are not stupid and they understand how much of a prominent part it plays in their lives.
2141520	2145400	In case you haven't noticed, they tend to collaborate a lot, and they almost certainly
2145400	2146400	talk to each other.
2146400	2150400	They've really created a collectivist community that seeks to benefit them all at once.
2150400	2154600	As YouTubers, they also witness the downfall of people like Leafy and how a brief bump
2154600	2158600	can begin a domino effect that subsequently destroys the channel, and given the fact a
2158600	2163560	lot of animators have created this codependency, if one of them was to fall flat it could subsequently
2163560	2164960	knock a load of them.
2164960	2169180	So the odd ones out interest and involvement in this topic and those who criticise it suddenly
2169180	2171040	becomes a lot more understandable.
2171040	2175720	And I do empathise with his approach, but it doesn't justify the actions always being
2175720	2179880	taken, nor does it change the fact that there are certain conclusions that can be drawn
2179880	2180880	from this behaviour.
2181240	2185200	This is why people do care about the fact that many respond to criticism badly.
2185200	2188400	As I said, there's a watering hole, and where there's a watering hole, there'll be people
2188400	2190040	attempting to poison it.
2190040	2194580	And in fact, I think the collectivist nature definitely poses the question, what happens
2194580	2196240	when something worse happens?
2196240	2197240	Because it will.
2197240	2200620	What happens when someone undesirable gets amongst the pack?
2200620	2202060	What if it's happening already?
2202060	2204980	What if it's already happened and it's just been swept under the rug?
2204980	2206120	How do you deal with that?
2206120	2210140	Because although what we've discussed today mainly centres around qualms, and a fair amount
2210140	2214200	of them which could be considered trivial, their response and subsequent philosophy seems
2214200	2218900	to breed an environment of potential for exploitation, and for all we know it may have already occurred,
2218900	2222880	I mean you look at things like Me Too and you see how easy it is to conceal things that
2222880	2225760	seem so unbelievably obvious in hindsight.
2225760	2228980	That's a conceptual comparison by the way, I'm not suggesting that there are any sexual
2228980	2232780	criminals within that community, though obviously the truth is out there somewhere.
2232780	2237200	Given a lot of the criticism revolves around how these storytime animators have conducted
2237200	2243180	themselves outside of videos, and sometimes even in private, it raises a real question,
2243180	2246660	the dangerous difference between a public and private persona, and people like Darth
2246660	2250980	Pinya are growing and their criticism is considered more validated because people are beginning
2250980	2255140	to realise that these friendly, supposedly more open commentators behind the scenes may
2255140	2259260	not be any more trustworthy than the previous generation that had been purged.
2259260	2262740	And bring it back to the original comment, that's what happens when you have a formula,
2262740	2267140	that's what happens when people realise that all you need is this persona, with some deviations
2267140	2271020	maybe, and sure there are people who definitely stand out from that, but if anyone can make
2271020	2275960	it using that, then the community will be infiltrated, Fox Goodman is not the first,
2275960	2280080	and he is certainly not the last, and as soon as it's been shown that anyone can do that,
2280080	2282760	then the whole concept becomes dubious to audiences.
2282760	2287200	Now once again, people will always act on the notion of innocent until proven guilty,
2287200	2291060	and I think that's the right thing to do, however that protective shield of premise
2291060	2295860	alone just is not there anymore, the animation community is built on the foundations that
2295860	2301300	depend on each other, on interdependency and interdependency, interdependency because
2301300	2306140	their personas are composed of many components of purity which set such a high bar that any
2306140	2310720	contradiction could cause that image to deteriorate, and interdependency and the fact that they
2310720	2315520	rely on each other to benefit the algorithm, therefore they need to equally preserve themselves
2315520	2316520	and each other.
2316520	2322160	And when things happen like this, it foreshadows something, and people are not reacting just
2322160	2326520	to what has happened, which is what the animators seem to wrongly construe, they're reacting
2326520	2330480	to the implications, they're reacting to the character narratives, they're reacting to
2330480	2334980	the possibilities in the future, and although the collective approach may benefit those
2334980	2339840	when it is successful, it will be highly detrimental when the pressure sets in and some creators
2339840	2340840	buckle.
2340840	2342640	Human nature dictates that.
2342640	2346920	Every community will have its due date, you can't stop an image being somewhat stained,
2346920	2351540	you can postpone it, but you cannot prevent it, and by making your content more intertwined
2351620	2356220	all you do is make it more susceptible when that day finally comes, when you represent
2356220	2360060	each other at your best, you represent each other at your worst.
2360060	2366020	There is a mix of hypocrisy, hubris, and even a touch of hysteria, but we can only look
2366020	2370300	currently from the observation deck, who knows what's going on behind the scenes.
2370300	2375340	I highly doubt that many of these people I've spoken about today are bad, in fact very few.
2375340	2379240	When you've spoken to people, and when you yourself have suffered at the hands of systems
2379240	2383240	structured no different to the one being established within storytime animation, it
2383240	2387640	becomes difficult to defend, especially when wrongdoings are being committed, and many
2387640	2391800	people who likely have experienced that too will wake up to the concept.
2391800	2396000	When you have an accessible community, like any, you have the good and the bad, but the
2396000	2400280	animation community seems set on only showing the good and hiding the bad, which is kind
2400280	2404960	of ironic as people kind of turn to the community to address their own imperfections, and as
2404960	2408700	commentators like the ones we've spoken about today force open the doors they will
2408740	2413740	show more and more cracks that we previously glossed over, and people's opinions will change.
2413740	2415700	If I were them, would I be concerned?
2415700	2419400	I don't know, maybe they're just paranoid, but I might consider changing my behaviour
2419400	2425620	towards those outside the community, something isn't better just because it takes more effort.
2425620	2429460	To summarise, when your community becomes accessible to less than talented creators,
2429460	2434380	and when an easy formula is in place then it's only a matter of time before the negative
2434380	2439380	starts to flow in, at which point many audiences will look to you to oust those people, however
2439380	2443620	with the attitudes adopted by the creators they seem to have a problem with that, at
2443620	2447900	which point the audience will lose that core faith in the creator, and the genre will subsequently
2447900	2452620	perish, and given how you set the standards, you're not going to make it easy for yourselves.
2452620	2457160	A genre itself can never be the good guy, and the animators may be able to outrun the
2457160	2461780	characters in their stories, may be able to outrun the fat kid, but they can't outrun
2461780	2466460	criticism, they can't outrun the algorithm, and they sure as hell can't outrun me.
2466460	2467460	The right opinion.
2526460	2554980	You can't think of anything else to say, I hope everyone as well, I as always appreciate
2554980	2561240	the support, the very passionate support, it is why I carry on doing this, I really
2561240	2565740	could have taken a break now, it's the start of the university year and I want to carry
2565740	2570720	on, I spoke to my parents and they said James, carry on your YouTube, see what you can do,
2570720	2576180	and so here I am sat here recording another one in a fucking mess of a desk slash mini
2576180	2583100	recording studio, which is barely, barely workable, but with enough perseverance it
2583100	2584220	may just pay off.
2584220	2589220	Next week hopefully the video will be more polished, that's all I can say.
2589220	2592900	So until then however, I'm The Right Opinion and I'll see you in the next one.
2614220	2615220	Bye.
2615220	2615240	Bye.
