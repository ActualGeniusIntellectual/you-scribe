0	10240	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,
10240	16960	and Autumn, it's not far away now, and soon I'm sure that we will be basking in the Autumn leaves like the outdoorsy people we are.
16960	22000	However, for the moments you've probably chosen to delay your joyous pastimes and watch this video,
22000	27960	in which we will discuss a curious comment that was brought to my attention recently, and the interesting rabbit hole it can take us down.
28120	34200	Security online is something that a lot of us value as a personal liberty for our privacy and our safety.
34200	40640	In the last decade, security online has taken multiple steps forward, but as large platforms are taking steps to protect their users,
40640	46640	hackers are never too far behind, always looking for methods to stir up trouble, whether that's attempting to obtain user data,
46640	49400	or merely hijack someone's account for comedic purposes.
49400	54640	Plenty of sites have encountered data breaches, and it's an unfortunate hazard that some are clearly ill-prepared for.
54680	59960	However, as much as hackers obtaining user data justifiably causes concern on a macro basis,
59960	63680	I think people are much more protective over the possession of their personal accounts,
63680	69920	because our personal accounts, regardless of size or influence, often pertain great personal value to us,
69920	74360	as a platform that can represent our thoughts, feelings, and even our creative ventures.
74360	79200	It's a piece of us. That sort of thing can definitely be exemplified with one's YouTube account.
79240	84640	Now, of course, many people merely create YouTube accounts for the purposes of commenting, subscribing, and following content,
84640	88280	however, for many people, a YouTube account allows us to express ourselves,
88280	94000	and even if we're projecting our content towards a large audience, it's still a product which feels deeply intimate to us,
94000	99600	which is why people care about others when they have their channels unnecessarily terminated or restricted.
99600	105040	We like to think that all in all, YouTube, in spite of their flaws, have a grip on keeping their accounts secure,
105040	108720	however, when you look at their track record, this could be called into contention.
108720	114720	I understand why you're wondering that the investigation resulted that no hijacking activity happened on the channel,
114720	120960	however, I can assure you that our internal team carefully investigated this, and didn't found any.
124800	127360	Didn't. Found. Any.
127360	133040	Over the last few years, many creators have reported their channel stolen, and subsequently used for less than dignified purposes,
133040	136960	in fact, it seems to be an overwhelmingly common occurrence for many users.
136960	142800	Now, when you have so many channels on a website like YouTube, it seems inevitable that some accounts will be hacked or stolen,
142800	148800	but today we're looking at an issue that transcends a few occurrences, and outlines a trend which appears pervasive on the platform,
148800	152160	and encompassed by one account, which went by the name of Logan.
152160	158000	If you follow any smaller creators, you'll have almost definitely seen this line of text in their comment section,
158000	165120	I can without a doubt say it's the widest spread comment I've ever seen, but it's so much more malicious than it seems on the surface.
165120	170160	In the small YouTuber world, attention and friends can be hard to come by, so when you're uploading content,
170160	176080	it's easy to be particularly receptive to anybody who may provide you with attention, especially larger channels.
176080	181280	However, for anyone who does have experience with being a smaller creator, you'll know that you have to regularly deal with comments
181280	188240	that from a cursory perspective seem fairly friendly, but often just reflect a veiled attempt to gain subscribers from inexperienced users.
188240	193120	Now, those who have familiarity with YouTube will tell you that this technique is rather redundant,
193120	199920	and most creators partaking in this will breed no longevity on their content, because you're just cultivating a load of dormant subscribers,
199920	204640	numbers really aren't everything on that front. Nonetheless, this doesn't stop people from trying,
204640	210800	and over the years, desperate creators have manufactured various automated techniques in an attempt to garner likes, views, and subs,
210800	216000	and eventually monetization. On the surface, this is what appears to be the case with the account named Logan,
216000	222560	a creator commenting on numerous uploads by smaller creators, with a simple three-word proposition, wannabe friends.
222560	227040	And with such an enticing offer, who wouldn't want to be friends with this lovely gent?
227040	231920	In times like these, we could use a good friend, like the lovely fellow Logan here.
231920	238960	However, as many of you have predicted, this comment was made by a bot, likely incapable of developing a meaningful friendship,
238960	243440	and Logan himself was merely publishing substandard content on how to grow your channel.
243440	248480	So what was the point? Was it merely farming views, or was it something a little more sinister?
248480	256880	Yeah, the real way he growed his channel so large was using bots, they're all bots, but bots using real accounts, your accounts actually.
256880	263360	Well, on the 13th of May, a YouTuber by the name of evans111 uploaded a video with the subtitle,
263360	269120	The Most Dangerous Comment on YouTube, referring to Logan's comment in question. How could such a comment be dangerous?
269120	274240	Well, according to Evan, it appears that creators who interact with this comment risk having their channel stolen,
274240	278560	and subsequently used in Logan's view farming ploy to boost his own YouTube channel.
278560	285040	Go on to his videos, and there were a plethora of generic, vague comments which appear to barely interact with the video at all,
285040	290000	and only lend credence to the idea that something is not quite right with the project that Logan is running.
290000	291280	Wanna be friends?
291280	299680	Somehow, this guy developed a way of hacking people's channels solely by having them subscribe to him, and this is incredibly alarming.
299680	307120	All these accounts posting these fake comments are real accounts, so this plague can go unnoticed by YouTube,
307120	312640	and his channel can thrive with nobody knowing how. This is not okay.
312640	319280	Evan postulates that this Logan character has created a bot which can take control of accounts who interact with its initial comment.
319280	325680	He warns people to not respond or react in any way. If this was true, it would be a huge breach in YouTube security,
325680	333360	and not one that can be ignored, and it wasn't. In barely any time at all, Logan's account vanished, and he became another YouTube relic.
333360	340880	All's well that ends well, right? Well, not entirely. The fact is that the perception of Logan presented may not be the entire truth,
340880	348320	and I'll explain why very soon. In spite of all the comments disappearing, Logan's channel was very much alive, it had merely shapeshifted a little.
348320	353520	So why aren't people doing more about this hacker? Well, probably because he may well not be a hacker.
353520	361760	However, take a look at the evidence today, and you'll find a truth perhaps more alarming, and one that should encourage awareness from YouTubers and YouTube alike.
373760	382080	So, to commence this interesting tale, we need to go back a few months, to a time when your boy Tro was a wide-eyed nipper who could still leave his house for leisure purposes.
382080	390960	Yes, in early 2020, I was dealing with an issue that I considered mostly internal at the time, however, this led me to investigate channels which I considered compromised.
390960	398800	However, one comment that appeared on multiple uploads was a comment by a channel named Tem, if you're wondering this character's relevance, all will be revealed.
398800	407440	When I clicked on Tem's channel, I was greeted by a similar video to that which was documented by Evans, in fact, the format was identical, the only thing different was the name.
407520	414480	Yo, what is going on, guys? My name is Tem R, and in this video, I'm gonna be showing you guys how to grow your YouTube channel just like I did.
414480	418720	So as you can see, I have gained a lot of subs for the past few days, and the pa-
418720	424960	The uploads that I was greeted by at the time were extremely bland uploads about how you could gain subscribers' views and traffic.
424960	435360	After all, this Tem guy was an expert, anyone who can secure tens of thousands of views on content with the personality of a grapefruit must be pulling off some impressive algorithmic massaging.
435440	444160	However, there was an additional parallel that could be drawn between these two channels, the comments section, which was also predominantly occupied with rote responses from small channels.
444160	455040	The only real difference is that some of these comments seem a bit more fleshed out, although many still represent a similar level of mental vacancy, however, there may be a reason for this which I'll soon divulge.
455040	465280	At this point, you're probably coming to the conclusion that Tem and Logan have both been drawing from the same framework, however, it goes one step further than that, because Tem and Logan are in fact the same person.
465760	467920	I'll give you a moment to let that sink in.
470800	477040	The voices were identical, and so was the format of the content, and now this isn't a huge surprise.
477040	482240	So Tem and Logan are the same person, big deal, but there are a couple more curious observations that we can make.
482240	491360	Firstly, this isn't the only channel, in fact, his highly successful Tips and Tricks channel was launched off the back of another channel which was at that point going by the same name.
491440	506880	So if you click on Tem, you'll see, oh wow, this channel has like 500,000 subscribers, that's crazy, usually people will go and see what videos they uploaded, but these aren't Tem's videos, you can see that this channel has no videos uploaded.
506880	514720	It was an interesting setup, basically, he had a playlist of his content, but it was being promoted through a different channel, why on earth would he be doing that?
514720	522800	Well, probably to loophole the YouTube guidelines, you see, his first channel here had obtained subscribers fairly fraudulently, but barely had any videos.
522800	534240	This is MrBeast, and this isn't MrBeast, but why isn't it? To the passive viewer, it appears to be his channel, it has his videos accordingly located, with the complementary view counts,
534240	542560	however, this is a classic trick used by the charlatans, they create a playlist, call it uploaded videos, and then position it at the forefront of the channel.
542560	548640	You can typically identify these channels by a lack of featured video, and the concealed subscriber count, often, I must add.
548640	558400	However, for the casual user, they may not notice, and come to the conclusion that they've been unsubscribed by YouTube's eternally faulty system, an understandable assumption, but an incorrect one.
558400	570480	Tem, or Logan, or Tom, or Todd, or fake MrBeast would then implement his bot to comment on smaller YouTubers who may find themselves starstruck in the moment, and not think to question the legitimacy of this account.
570480	578000	He pulled this off for a while, and ended up with over 100,000 subscribers, however, if you go back further, you'll realise that this wasn't even the case,
578000	586080	and that he was previously an account known as Trap Town, who was also notorious amongst communities, for guess what, doing exactly the same thing.
586160	593920	If you've got a YouTube channel, they'll send you a nice little message saying that they like your video, and they'll ask you, hey do you want to be a YouTube friend?
593920	601280	Now you might be asking yourself, what's a YouTube friend? They're basically asking, if you subscribe to my channel, I'll subscribe to yours.
601280	608480	YouTube frowns on this, some people call it sub for sub, now the problem comes in if you subscribe to their channel.
608480	614400	Now if you go to their website to subscribe, when you get to their channel, it looks like a normal channel.
614480	623840	Now notice, you can't tell how many people have already subscribed. Now let me show you what's really weird, when you click on videos, there's no videos on this channel.
623840	629440	They want you to subscribe, now the problem comes in what they do with your information.
629440	637760	From what I understand, they start by selling your information, and with dishonest people like this, who knows what else they'll do with it.
637760	645200	The creator who uploaded this video, Liv Free, alleges that if you subscribe to them, they acquire your information, and supposedly sell it on.
645200	650880	There is no accompanying evidence shown, and to be honest, this guy doesn't seem completely certain what their motives are.
650880	657600	The internet is a dangerous place out there. You want to protect yourself and others, and that's why I've got this video out here.
657600	664720	Chances are if you're watching this, they've already hit your channel, just do yourself and everybody else a favour, stay clear.
664720	673200	One of the strangest things is that in spite of this mass live subscriber farming campaign, if you look at one of the Social Blade archives that I saved before the channels were shut down,
673200	683520	you'd notice they almost certainly bought subscribers for their channel. At some point, you can see the uploaded video, but heaven knows what that video was, it seems they were set uploading on this other channel.
683520	691120	So after he had accrued enough subscribers, Tem decided to launch his channel, where he provides rather useless advice for the budding creator.
691120	701280	Now, for most people, when they want to create a new channel, they would just create it, right? Well, not here. In fact, I saved an old archive of the channel listing which Tem subsequently purchased.
701280	709200	Before this, it was a channel by the name of Xerox, who had just over 2,500 subscribers, and had the channel on the market for $200.
709200	718240	So as we understand, Tem bought a channel worth $200 who had 2,500 subscribers to launch his channel, which he'd promote using the 150,000 subscriber channel.
718240	727200	So why would a person fork out a couple hundred for a channel which appeared no different to a clean slate? Two words, monetization enabled.
727200	734720	A few years back, YouTube restricted monetization so that only channels above a certain threshold of subscribers and watch time could apply for monetization.
734720	742480	Now, if you were to acquire views through fraudulent methods, this may be identified when one applies for monetization, so by obtaining some real subscribers,
742480	749680	and then buying this second pre-monetized channel, it allows Tem to promote monetized content, and make the methods appear more above board.
749680	754880	However, it's just a rather elaborate ploy to bypass the protections that YouTube have in place for this.
754880	762880	So Logan wanted to make a buck through a rather complex scheme, but if you're aware of the original narrative, you may begin to formulate some questions.
762880	768240	What business would a hacker have in buying a channel? Surely he'd just hack one.
768480	774080	And to that, my friends, I'd say, good question. Well, let's see if we can crack this confusing case.
785600	791920	With the evidence that we have assembled currently, does the idea that this Logan guy is a seasoned hacker really stack up?
791920	797440	Well, obviously, he's operating some sort of enterprise which involves less than kosher methods of acquiring traffic,
797440	802960	but is he the individual hacking all these channels which appear on his videos, or is he just the buyer?
802960	809920	Obviously, it is a possibility that Tem was the individual who listed the channel before removing the listing and deciding to use the channel himself,
809920	815440	as the seller doesn't actually have any sales to his name. However, the transaction may have been done off-site,
815440	821200	and it also doesn't explain the unusual methods of procuring people's data, which would have been done through interaction.
821200	826560	There was no established correlation between the channels who Logan commented on, and the channels that had been compromised.
826560	832880	If Logan had installed a bot that commented on multiple channels' videos, and some of those channels were subsequently targeted for hacking,
832880	837120	then of course, it may lead some people to believe that Logan was the individual who hacked their channel.
837120	844960	Correlation, however, does not imply causation. Nonetheless, it seems an exceptionally strange system being run by this mysterious character,
844960	850960	and he had developed a comment bot, so he must have a degree of technical proficiency, unless it wasn't his, which it may not have been.
850960	856800	As if this project wasn't complex enough as it was, around the time that Tem's videos concerning channel growth were released,
856800	862960	there was another person by the name of The Comical Canadian, who uploaded videos with nearly identical titles and thumbnails.
862960	869760	The Comical Canadian's channel was focused around gaming, however, he was also notorious among smaller creators for operating a similar comment bot,
869760	876240	as well as allegedly conducting spam streams in an attempt to solicit subscriptions and money from unsuspecting users.
876240	883600	So this guy is not only scamming people out of their money, I mean, I guess if you donate to him, you know, whatever,
883600	891840	but he's constantly got all this, like, fake giveaway, fake shoutout, well, maybe not fake shoutout, I haven't done enough research into him,
891840	899360	but fake giveaways, right? And these kids that are watching him are probably only, like, 10.
899360	905680	You know, it pisses me off when I see someone like this scamming little kids out of their money.
905680	911520	In an interview with another small creator, he states that he'd been conducting business the way he has for financial benefit,
911520	920400	and I suppose it makes sense. This then ties back to our friend Vaxxie, or Logan, who is using a similar technique, with a few, well, giveaways.
920400	927040	If we look here, in one of these videos by Vaxxie himself, he mentions a Fortnite code, code Canadian.
927040	933360	Remember to type in code Canadian in the Fortnite item shop and subscribe and hit the bell so I can send you a gift.
933360	941360	And remember, the comical Canadian was using an interesting code back in the day, about a month ago. Oh, code Canadian. It's the same guy.
941360	946880	However, once again, it doesn't seem like much hacking comes into it. I know how much he made from this method,
946880	952560	and I never had the privilege of watching his streams in action, but it's possible that this bloke alongside Timothy
952560	959760	had been reinvesting their money into new get rich quick schemes, which they run as long as they can until YouTube notices these antics.
959760	965760	It's smash and grab content creation. Another creator, Timeworks, made a good video on his theory for why they're doing it,
965760	968240	which comes down to the value of channels.
968240	974800	Timeworks- Yeah, this is a subscriber farm. They're growing channels, gaining hundreds of thousands of subscribers,
974800	981200	and then, I would assume, selling the channels for a profit. More recently, we've heard of people hacking channels,
981200	986960	and then selling them, but this is a more efficient way, because no one's actually getting harmed here.
986960	996080	It's just one big sort of scam spam thing, and they make a lot of money by selling these channels that they sort of grow.
996080	1000960	He provides good running commentary on the creators of these bots, who have recently come back under the name
1000960	1006240	Bananarama, and many others, and even conducted an interview with one of the people involved.
1006240	1010800	If you want to know what the dude is up to, then definitely check it out. It seems they buy the channel,
1010800	1014400	do what they plan on doing, with an undisclosed goal.
1014400	1018720	So the next very important question I asked is, do people get hacked in all of this?
1018720	1023680	And I asked it right away, because I knew that this was a major concern for the whole YouTube community.
1023680	1029440	And so Supremacy said, straight off the bat, no. The only hacking here that's going on is false information.
1030560	1037440	So he did mention some other people, like Evans, who was mentioned in the whole Logan wannabe friend situation.
1037440	1043680	So he said that Optimus was lying for clout, Evans is confusing, and so he went on to defend a bunch of things,
1043680	1048000	why they do not hack your channel. Now of course, they could be lying to you.
1048560	1053760	I personally don't think they actually do, but you know, they lie to you when they say wannabe friends.
1055120	1060320	So this actually could be a lie, I don't know. Do you know what happens to channels when it's done being used?
1060320	1065360	Because the Vaxi channel is sort of off doing its whole loop to live stream thing, so like, do they
1065360	1069920	actually sell the channels? That's what I was trying to get at. Why is Vaxi off doing something else now?
1070640	1076160	And they didn't answer, and that's where the interview sort of ended.
1076160	1080480	Now, that would explain a majority of the shenanigans utilised by this curious couple.
1080480	1084560	However, we can't necessarily ignore the fact that hacking has been involved somewhere.
1084560	1090480	When you look at the comments on the uploads, these are not just phantom accounts that were never occupied by anyone real.
1090480	1097040	These were not merely bots, these are real people who make real content, having their accounts hijacked on an unprecedented scale.
1097040	1102080	However, it doesn't stop there, because then we need to take a look at that $200 transaction that Tem made.
1102080	1107600	Now, on the surface, there's not too much to say. There was a channel up for sale, someone bought it, no questions, eh?
1107600	1109920	Well, there are a few quibbles that one might raise.
1110560	1114800	Now, firstly, as I understand it, selling your channel is a violation of YouTube's terms of service,
1114800	1120320	and it's something you can find on the relevant page. Although they don't seem to take a particularly strong stance about it,
1120320	1125520	it seems that selling it on third-party websites comes into conflict with their AdSense policy.
1125520	1129440	This makes sense for obvious reasons, because people could just buy a monetized channel,
1129440	1134640	and begin posting content that YouTube did not approve. However, this is more YouTube's PR problem.
1134640	1139760	What boils down to being a creator-oriented problem is what you can find by digging a little further.
1139760	1145760	YouTube channels have value, they've always held some value, but if you look beyond the individual listings for that account,
1145760	1150160	you'll find a website flogging various accounts for varying prices known as Axe Market.
1150160	1154160	They're selling YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Telegram, and Twitter accounts.
1154240	1159200	Now, this website does have a verification procedure to make sure you have access to the account you're selling.
1159200	1163040	However, if someone is infiltrated that account to use it for malicious purposes,
1163040	1166080	this is not a really sufficient means of confirmation.
1166080	1170720	One of the most expensive listings, a wrestling channel with just under 500,000 subscribers,
1170720	1174000	has one comment which informs people that the channel has been hacked.
1174000	1178480	This does not necessarily mean the channel was hacked, though it's certainly not a good omen.
1178480	1183440	On top of this, a fair few listings have the disclaimer that there was no confirmation provided at all,
1183440	1186880	which confuses me as to why there's even a listing in that instance.
1186880	1191440	Some posters on these sites seem to have multiple listings, many of them thematically dissonant,
1191440	1194880	not the sort of channels that one would merely feel like selling at once.
1194880	1198480	The website also has a feature where you can notify them that the channel is yours,
1198480	1200000	and you want to delete the listing.
1200000	1204160	However, unless you're made aware prior to the sale, then you would never know to react,
1204160	1208640	and even then it would rely on you deducing that your channel's been hacked and was being sold,
1208640	1210560	and then finding the marketplace.
1210560	1215360	Channels with an online presence that may boost their algorithmic potential can be very profitable,
1215360	1219040	particularly ones which have monetisation enabled, because as mentioned earlier,
1219040	1223040	it is now a non-inclusive feature, so people wanting to have that boost,
1223040	1226960	people like Tem, will obviously see the appeal in these websites.
1226960	1231360	For example, the person who purchased a channel by the name of TBBAP,
1231360	1234640	otherwise known as Two Best Brothers Bitch About Ponies,
1234640	1237760	they were highly unsatisfied with their purchase because after a few weeks,
1237760	1239600	they lost access to the account.
1239600	1243280	Why was this? Well, it's because the channels were stolen from a large group of creators
1243280	1246480	who actually had the clout to attract YouTube's attention, and after a month,
1246480	1249440	they managed to regain ownership of what was rightfully theirs,
1249440	1253120	which obviously upset the buyer. My heart does weep.
1253120	1257760	Many creators will never possess this privilege, and with YouTube's policy making pre-established
1257760	1262080	monetised channels more lucrative and important than ever, scammers are attempting to take
1262080	1266160	advantage of this business, and then flogging these channels online to clients like Tem
1266160	1268240	who want a shortcut to stardom.
1268240	1272880	The strange thing is, I don't have a problem with people selling their channels on principle.
1272880	1276560	Although I do see why it's against the terms of service, it makes complete sense,
1276560	1280480	there's no way that YouTube would be able to universally enforce such a policy,
1280480	1284800	so the best thing they can do is focus on those whose accounts have been compromised
1284800	1287600	and work towards recovering them, right? Well.
1287600	1298560	YouTube has a waringly impersonal relationship with a majority of their creators.
1298560	1303040	It's unavoidable to a point, but there has to be a stage where YouTube starts to listen to people
1303040	1307600	who represent the majority of full-time partners, not just the mainstream TV imports,
1307600	1312000	and not just the YouTube goliaths, because creators from different echelons are likely
1312000	1316720	to face different problems. A lot of scammers tend to benefit most off small channels,
1316720	1320000	mainly because they're the ones that you can seize with the fewest repercussions.
1320000	1323280	The creators are more unacquainted with the particularities of YouTube,
1323280	1325920	thus making them more vulnerable, and once they've lost their channels,
1325920	1329680	they have much less power to bring it to YouTube's attention. A lot of these channels
1329680	1333680	tend to be inactive as well, which means the creator may not even be paying attention to
1333680	1338240	what happens with it. However, more than enough times a channel is targeted which involves a
1338240	1342720	somewhat influential YouTuber, or an individual who is part of a great community which will
1342720	1343920	amplify their endeavor.
1372720	1386480	I could explore the numerous anecdotes which tell us about the issue,
1386480	1390240	and how YouTube handled it. However, the most notable example from the last 12 months was
1390240	1394720	created by the name of Megan Riggs, a beauty YouTuber with over 2 million subscribers.
1394720	1399120	In a series of videos, she speaks about an ordeal which involved her channels being stolen,
1399120	1401760	and YouTube's somewhat sloppy approach to the situation,
1429120	1436560	I'm going to try and keep it brief, but after her main account was breached,
1436560	1440560	it was hidden from a number of her subscribers, who notified her immediately. This then led to
1440560	1444640	a drawn out exchange with Team YouTube, who repeatedly sent her the wrong instructions
1444640	1445360	to resolve it.
1474640	1480240	Until today, when I sent over, hey, this one video on that channel seems weird, they say,
1480240	1486640	oh, wow, our bad, we've been looking into the vlog channel. I don't know about you guys,
1486640	1491440	but to me, it doesn't really make a lot of sense. Not only had I filled out all of those
1491440	1498240	forms and questions about my main channel, the channels don't have the same or similar URLs,
1498240	1503760	they're not attached to the same email addresses, and we haven't been talking about that one.
1503760	1509600	They apologize for the snafu, the mix-up, the kerfuffle, and then they proceed to send me
1509600	1514640	the steps to unhide my channel. They also acknowledge that these are the exact same
1514640	1518960	steps that they had sent me previously and sent the screen recordings out. So essentially,
1518960	1524000	we are back at square one, where we were at on October 24th, and it's November 9th.
1524000	1529920	Despite being offended, I cleared my cookies in my cachet, and surprise, it didn't work. And then,
1529920	1534240	as if I wasn't about to lose it already, I get an email in which they said,
1534240	1539360	this would be the final attempt to unhide my channel. So this final attempt, you would think,
1539360	1544000	balls to the wall, something we haven't tried before, risky, things might go wrong. No,
1544000	1549680	it's the same link to unhide my channel that they sent me before, the same basic instructions on how
1549680	1555120	to unhide a YouTube channel that anybody can access. November 11th, they then realize that
1555120	1561280	they've sent me the wrong link. Oh, our bad, we sent you the wrong link.
1563120	1568240	Not laughing. They then provide me with another link to unhide my YouTube channel, and guess what?
1568240	1572160	It works. Do you know why? Because it's a completely different link than they had sent me
1572160	1577440	all of these previous times to unhide my channel. It is also a link that cannot be accessed unless
1577440	1582240	you have a direct link. You need someone from YouTube to send you this link directly for you
1582240	1588880	to be able to even see this part of the site, a link. So instead, it took from October 24th
1588880	1594800	to November 11th for my channel to be fully reinstated, when all I needed was a link.
1594800	1599120	This was already a bit of a shambles, however, in this instance, the hackers were particularly
1599120	1603280	persistent and eventually gained access to Megan's second account, her vlog channel,
1603280	1608960	changing the login before she could even react, then selling it on a forum for the grand fee of $500.
1608960	1615040	And this would be the first of several compilation videos of pretty obviously stolen content,
1615040	1619680	which are accompanied by a bunch of comments, which seem totally legit,
1619680	1623760	very much pertaining to the content of the video. Definitely human.
1625120	1631200	And definitely from the 500,000 people that had been subscribed to this YouTube channel.
1631200	1636400	Sound similar? I thought so. This channel then rebrands to Beauty Dior, and begins uploading
1636400	1641200	copyrighted content. This then triggers thousands of people to unsubscribe, as the audience didn't
1641200	1645280	recognise the channel, and wouldn't want anything to do with such meritless content. With a
1645280	1649120	sufficient level of evidence, it becomes quite apparent that this channel is no longer in
1649120	1653520	Megan's possession, so if it isn't too difficult for any casual observer to see the problem,
1653520	1656640	then YouTube shouldn't have too much trouble either, should they?
1656640	1661920	Not to mention, with a quick search, you could tell that this URL was my vlog channel,
1661920	1666400	which seemed to be much simpler than explaining over the course of nearly a month of emails what
1666400	1671440	a hidden channel looks like. This time, I have so much more ammo. Literally, it's been rebranded.
1671440	1676240	There's a whole other name, there's a description, there's a video up. I feel like this is like open
1676240	1680960	and shut case. Well, apparently so. After escalating the issue to their internal team,
1680960	1686000	they conducted an extensive investigation, and came to the resounding conclusion that there was
1686000	1689200	no suspicious activity. What?
1689200	1696240	So then between February 13th and February 21st, there have been multiple emails exchanged. Lots
1696240	1700240	of these very human responses from YouTube giving me updates that don't say anything,
1700240	1704240	and lots of my manager being like, hey, what's going on? We need to figure this out. Then
1704240	1709120	February 22nd comes around, and YouTube had finally figured it out. Actually, first,
1709120	1714000	my manager had followed up yet again, and they responded to that email with their findings.
1714000	1718960	Hi there. Thanks for the prompt response. This case was opened because this second channel of
1718960	1724000	Megan was claimed hacked. We asked our internal team to do an investigation about this report.
1724000	1727920	We just got an update from our team that after our investigation,
1727920	1732480	we can state that there were no signs of abnormal activity found in the channel.
1734560	1737360	Feel free to email us back if you have any other concerns.
1738480	1743040	The fact that I am not Beauty Dior, this is not my channel, and this has clearly been hacked.
1743040	1747440	I understand why you're wondering that the investigation resulted that no hijacking
1747440	1752240	activity happened on the channel. However, I can assure you that our internal team carefully
1752240	1764320	investigated this and didn't found any. Didn't found any. To help keep your account safe in the
1764320	1769040	future, please view these tips on how to create a strong password and give your account extra
1769040	1773520	security here. Sorry that I don't have good news for you, but if you have other concerns,
1773520	1779280	let us know. They are telling me that my YouTube account has not been hacked,
1779280	1782560	and then they give me the steps to protect my YouTube account from being hacked.
1782560	1785360	The YouTube account that I don't have access to because it has been hacked.
1787200	1791200	Yes, it seems that in spite of the deluge of verification that Megan displays,
1791200	1796160	the very professional specialist cybermonkeys of the eternal team were not won over. On top of
1796160	1800640	this, a lot of YouTube's correspondence could be described as a bit incompetent.
1827120	1829200	Hi, Alex. How's it going?
1833200	1836560	I want to let you know that there's about 10 people on this email chain. No one's name is
1836560	1844000	Alex. There's no Alexander. There's no Alexandra. I've never spoken to an Alex at YouTube. I'm
1844000	1849680	Alex. Bob here, stepping in for Chad today, who has been so eager to resolve your case.
1849680	1854080	Have you been? Have you been so eager? You've clearly done so much. I just wanted you to know
1854080	1859200	that our eyes are all glued on our case. Let me remind you that I haven't been on these emails
1859200	1864880	since the end of January, so I only get these sent later. My manager's assistant responds with,
1864880	1870080	thanks, the manager's name is, and the client's name is Megan Rinks. Nobody's named Alex here.
1870080	1875280	Hi, apologies. My last email was meant for you and not someone by the name of Alex.
1875280	1876400	Thanks for understanding.
1876400	1880640	In response, Megan decides that there's only one option, which is to openly drag YouTube,
1880640	1884720	because as many creators have experienced, is often the only way to make them actually
1884720	1889280	take notice. So she tweets out her frustrations, and eventually, with the help of Shane Dawson
1889280	1894480	and Gigi Hadid, Megan initiates a conversation with the Team YouTube Twitter account. However,
1894480	1899280	this conversation was equally confusing and unsatisfying, particularly with mine to the
1899280	1904960	emails she was now being sent. But they then also informed me that they will be marking this case
1904960	1912080	a high priority. Again, the emails we had previously talked about, we were done. It was
1912080	1915840	done. Nothing had happened, but it wasn't until Shane tweeted, they were like, actually, we're
1915840	1918720	going to make this a high priority. Make what high priority? I thought this case, did you,
1918720	1923680	are we doing it again? Prior to this, there was no suspicious activity. They couldn't found any.
1923680	1928240	Case was pretty much closed. Is it a weird coincidence that this new email comes with them
1928240	1933520	marking this case as high priority, just a mere hour after Shane tweeted, and also then talked
1933520	1939680	to his personal YouTube rep about it? What do you think? Seems a little sus to me. Eventually,
1939680	1944400	over two months after her channel was stolen, YouTube emailed her a resolution on how to
1944400	1950880	recover her channel. Fantastic. Well, not quite. You see, there was a catch. Hi there, I hope you're
1950880	1955040	having a good day in spite of the issue you're having with your channel. My name is Tim, and I
1955040	1959200	will be working on your case for the time being. To get started, we need these information from you
1959200	1964320	in order for us to transfer the channel ownership back to you. Why weren't these steps going on
1964320	1967360	before? This is the legal template, and we would really appreciate it if you can fill this out
1967360	1970800	soon as for us to start the process of transferring your channel to your new email address. I'm sorry,
1970800	1975120	fast for you, because you took months to do this, and also, you had given up? You can transfer an
1975120	1978560	account back to me, and you weren't even going to f***ing tell me? Are you f***ing kidding?
1978560	1981760	Personal Google account slash email address. Please provide the email address if you have it.
1981760	1985040	Enter address or link. This account cannot already have a channel on it. Please certify that you're
1985040	1988880	the owner of this channel. Please certify that you have the commercial use rights to all content
1988880	1992320	contained on the account. Please certify there are no ongoing outstanding debts, arrangements,
1992320	1995280	or contractual obligations still pending regarding this channel. It's definitely still
1995280	1998400	in content, but I didn't steal it. Please certify that you're understanding that we will delete
1998400	2001680	personal data associated with the original channel prior to transfer. That includes the following.
2001680	2005280	Private videos, private and unlisted playlists. All of my videos are private! You're just gonna
2005280	2009840	delete them? Why? To the extent permitted by applicable law, I agree to defend,
2009840	2013680	identify, and hold harmless YouTube, impairing corporation, officers, directors, employees,
2013680	2017680	and agents, form and against any all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities,
2017680	2020800	costs or debt, and expenses, including but not limited to attorney fees arising from the
2020800	2024160	content on this channel, the uses of this account, and or any claim that my content
2024160	2028400	caused damage to a third party. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive these
2028400	2033280	terms and my use of the YouTube service. So if you didn't catch that, the email YouTube just sent
2033920	2038240	is that I can have my channel and they're transferred over to me. I just have to agree to
2038240	2043920	not sue them, and also I can't have any of the videos that were privated, which is all of them.
2043920	2049040	Literally why? I don't want beauty to yours videos. However, it wasn't really much of a catch,
2049040	2053760	because as she would later observe, such an email could not possibly be legally binding for a
2053760	2058880	multitude of reasons. So the video goes live, and there's a load more debauchery, which I shan't
2058880	2062960	delve into. If you want to watch the videos, you know where to find them. So after the video,
2062960	2068240	and after all the publicity, YouTube manages to scramble together two options, presented to
2068240	2072720	Megan in a phone call. The first option being that, as the hacker has deleted all the videos,
2072720	2077040	Megan can send them all her old videos, and YouTube will upload them all at once,
2077040	2081520	following the restoration of the channel. Megan can't really agree to this option as she doesn't
2081520	2087280	have her old uploads, YouTube was her archive for that content. So the second option, yes,
2087280	2091440	this one being that YouTube can delete the channel and let Megan make a new one,
2091440	2094400	an option which Megan doesn't seem particularly thrilled by.
2094400	2099040	Megan- How is that helping? Also, again, I don't really have plans on uploading to this channel,
2099040	2103680	I just want the videos. Would I love if the channel was intact with the videos there?
2103680	2108240	Yes. But would I like to make a new vlog channel? No. Also, I don't need your permission to make a
2108240	2111920	YouTube channel, Claire. I can do that whenever I want. Between these two options, you are literally
2111920	2116240	offering me a channel with 500,000 subscribers and a channel with none, neither of which have
2116240	2121600	my videos, which is the only thing I wanted. They explained that the reason option two even exists
2121600	2125360	is because they are rolling me protecting it in case something bad happened.
2126240	2132080	Were you were you not protecting the first one? Apparently, that is a superpower they have. You
2132080	2135760	just need to know really far in advance before they hack it so they can, like, put you on an
2135760	2139920	elite list and be like, don't hack them. They're my friends. Also, it's not even that. I think she
2139920	2143200	just said that. Like, there's literally nothing she could do to prevent my channel from being hacked.
2143200	2146640	I don't think they care. Now, for many people at this point, I'm sure you're thinking that
2146640	2151760	there must be some degree in which YouTube keeps archives of the videos themselves in case of this
2151760	2156640	sort of eventuality. Well, it seems they do, but the YouTube representatives claim that they can
2156640	2161600	only keep archives of creator videos for 30 days following their deletion. However, Meghan then
2161600	2166400	appears to disprove that as well. Meghan- Even when I think I must have asked three separate times,
2166400	2171440	what is the average amount of time it takes for a channel to be back through hacking? They couldn't
2171440	2177280	respond when they finally said, which is a totally legitimate and fine answer. If you didn't tell me
2177280	2183200	before that there is a set in stone 30-day time limit in which the time of the videos are fully
2183200	2188720	deleted and not recoverable from YouTube anymore. How can it vary? It varies from, what, one week to
2188720	2194320	four and a half weeks? Regardless, if you didn't figure it out in 30 days, that's on you. That is
2194320	2198960	your fault. A lot of stuff in here, AdSense, things like that, but what I'm going to focus on is that
2198960	2204560	30-day rule of data retention. She says, and I quote, regarding your question about data retention-
2204560	2208000	She didn't thank me for asking this question. Regarding your question about data retention,
2208000	2212480	as we mentioned during our call, we have data retention policies that this is a link to the
2212480	2217680	Google data retention policy. I then click on the link of the data retention policies, assuming that
2217680	2222320	it's going to verify in detail everything that they said to me on the call and this email.
2222320	2228320	Specifically, the 30-day data retention policy that Claire and Walter keep referencing as literal
2228320	2232160	fact. I assume this link is going to verify everything they've been telling me, and I am
2232160	2237360	only a few sentences in before I realize that everything they've been saying is not true.
2237360	2242400	According to this article, there is absolutely a chance that I should be able to get my videos back.
2242400	2248160	Something that has never been a part of option one or two. Not once in the document does it ever say
2248160	2253840	there is a set in stone, forever and always, 30-day policy in which videos will be deleted.
2253840	2260000	30 days is not mentioned once. For being mentioned so many times on the phone call and the emails,
2260000	2265920	it is not mentioned once on Google's official page of their data retention policy. To this day,
2265920	2270640	I have never seen 30 days in writing other than these emails. Furthermore,
2270640	2275920	inserting an exact quote from the policy they sent me, our services also use encrypted backup storage
2275920	2280160	as another layer of protection to help recover from potential disasters. Data can remain on
2280160	2284640	these systems for up to six months. This process generally takes around two months from the time
2284640	2290000	of deletion. I say the videos were not deleted two months ago. If it takes two months for the
2290000	2294080	videos to be fully deleted, why wouldn't any of the videos be left? Did you halt the two-month
2294080	2299360	deleting process? When? This often includes up to a month-long recovery period in case the data was
2299360	2305520	removed unintentionally. To which I specify the wording here is often, not always, or not standard
2305520	2311760	policy. There is no mention of a hard binding 30-day limit. I then send a link to a video that
2311760	2315520	Lilly had sent me earlier about someone whose channel was hacked and they got all of their
2315520	2320320	videos back. The description of this guy's video literally says that someone on the inside of
2320320	2326160	YouTube was able to get his videos back and it took a miracle. I say why wasn't this my experience?
2326160	2329280	And with this, some glaring issues begin to become apparent.
2330800	2335920	Why did it take so long for my channel to be investigated only to be resulted in no hijacking?
2335920	2340480	Why did YouTube just now tell me that the 30-day time limit, when this is such pertinent information
2340480	2344240	if I'm frantically trying to recover my YouTube videos, and that has always been my number one
2344240	2348240	priority, is to recover my YouTube videos? If investigating faster would have improved the
2348240	2353200	chances of retaining my entire library of content, why did no one intervene sooner? And why is it not
2353200	2359600	public knowledge? There are multiple pitfalls in YouTube's reaction and response to this situation,
2359600	2365760	however, it boils down to one key problem. That being, simply put, YouTube relies on templates,
2365760	2368880	for situations that cannot merely rely on templates.
2395760	2399840	At any time that I express my frustration and ask a question, the response I would get is
2399840	2404160	I'm so happy that you could express your feelings. Thank you for sharing that with us.
2404160	2408560	A fair proportion of Megan's second video highlights YouTube attempting, and mostly
2408560	2413520	failing, to cover for their egregious oversight through vague, evasive language, which provides
2413520	2418560	no information for how on earth, when originally investigating, they found no signs of suspicious
2418560	2423680	activity. In my opinion, this was because their internal team were using a template which had a
2423680	2428640	set of prerequisites to identify what suspicious activity would constitute as, and what occurred
2428640	2433440	on Megan's second channel was not picked up, because they didn't know who Megan was. If the
2433440	2438160	crew over at YouTube had even attempted to branch out into basic logic, then they would have
2438160	2442880	identified the problem quickly and dealt with it. The internet is one of the fastest evolving
2442880	2447920	environments, and too often, YouTube has shown that they cannot keep up. To add to this, the
2447920	2452560	YouTube Creator support team used templates when in contact with Megan, which led to the rather
2452560	2457200	insulting errors, and what Megan read into as gaslighting. This then inevitably followed through
2457200	2461440	to the more advanced team members she came into correspondence with, because they clearly didn't
2461440	2465280	know everything which had been said to her previously, and thus didn't know how to respond
2465280	2470000	to Megan's comments, which were loaded with her previous experiences. YouTube likes to have a
2470000	2474160	singular narrative which is based on what they know. The problem is that there are just so many
2474160	2478800	people at YouTube who hold different pieces of information to deal with such problems, and the
2478800	2483360	fact that this has been happening for so long, and it took a large creator to bring attention to it,
2483360	2486640	is unbelievable, yet unsurprising.
2486640	2494000	I am so tired, and I'm so exhausted with dealing with all of this stuff, and it's been such a toll
2494000	2501040	on my mental health, especially like... I have to be okay with the fact that I lost my vlog. Like, I
2501040	2506800	have to be okay with it, because I need to move on. If I just try and find all these other, like,
2506800	2511120	loopholes and things like that, like, it's exhausting. Like, I need to start the process of
2511120	2513600	getting over it and being okay.
2513600	2518640	In a final video on the situation, Megan states that YouTube has since taken responsibility and
2518640	2523920	apologised for the fiasco, while committing to some serious changes, changes that will be welcome,
2523920	2528560	but they still don't really acknowledge the amplitude of the problem. Hacking isn't a problem
2528560	2533600	that's going to disappear overnight. This problem is going to persist as long as there continues to
2533600	2538160	be people looking to purchase channels with greater financial potential than those which are
2538160	2543040	newly created, and as we've seen, people who are in the business of mass selling channels probably
2543040	2547520	didn't come into possession of them by asking nicely. Maybe YouTube has a better system of
2547520	2552480	identifying this when a person complains about it now, but in times like these, a lot of those voices
2552480	2557840	will not be heard. Additionally, Megan Rinks had a content manager, which is another benefit that
2557840	2563040	many individuals are not privy to. When I emailed them recently about an issue, they asked me to
2563040	2567360	name my content manager, and when I said I didn't have a content manager, and that it would be
2567360	2572320	really good to have one, the YouTube representative who I was talking to just straight up asked what
2572320	2578160	a content manager was. When I explained, he redirected me to the Content ID system, which was
2578160	2583440	not thrilling. So unfortunately, I cannot confirm that YouTube's creator support is improving on the
2583440	2588880	template front. YouTube need to get with it. There are too many layers, too much incoherence, and too
2588880	2593520	much impersonality when dealing with creators. As I have said, it's impossible to completely prevent
2593520	2598240	the hacking of channels when there are so many given YouTube size, but for too long it was treated
2598240	2602880	with inaction which has led to a lot of flaws being exposed. They have since been encouraging
2602880	2607200	two-factor authentication, which is definitely a step in the right direction, but I feel that for
2607200	2611680	many creators unfamiliar with the platform, the request will probably fall on deaf ears.
2612320	2617040	A lot of people just don't pay enough attention if it doesn't happen to them, particularly when
2617040	2622640	the channels are only being used as basic comment or like bots. Once again, in spite of the rules
2622640	2627200	against it, it's often hard to notice which channels are using it unless it's really transparent,
2627200	2631440	like with Logan, particularly with YouTube's policy which rounds up subscriber counts now.
2631440	2636000	There are companies that advertise their service, some of which boast that all their accounts are
2636000	2641920	organic and legit. How do you think they obtain those legit accounts? Hell, recently a large creator
2641920	2646560	by the name of Deji ended up in hot water after it was pretty seriously alleged that he spotted
2646560	2653120	his way to 10 million subscribers. The evidence was quite convincing, and his response left a bit to be desired.
2653120	2660000	You really think I'm that much of a moron? To bot subs? When my views aren't that high, it won't calibrate.
2660000	2667200	It just wouldn't work. It makes no sense. You guys must really think I'm dumb. My IQ level is
2667200	2674880	dumb high, alright? I'm not trying to brag. My IQ level is 189. That is a very high IQ, okay?
2674880	2681040	Without any real behind the scenes technical evidence, you couldn't prove anything to a degree
2681040	2685680	where his channel would face repercussions, particularly given his size. This actually could be
2685680	2691040	a topic for another time, so I'll leave that here. In Megan's third video, she explained how she
2691040	2695680	needed to speak to executive level people with serious clearance to even understand why she
2695680	2700560	couldn't recover her channels. Megan- And they couldn't tell me, Claire and Walter on the phone,
2700560	2704720	what day the vlogs had been deleted because they didn't have access, they didn't have that level
2705440	2709200	make it sound like the White House, but like that security clearance or access. And even the person
2709200	2713600	I talked to who was incredibly high up at YouTube, they had to go ask somebody who's really high up in
2713600	2718560	the tech spot to specifically go in and figure that out. And the day that my videos were deleted
2718560	2723280	was the day that my channel got hacked. Their video count uploader, that's not something that
2723280	2728480	updates regularly. It takes a little while before it reflects that, and that was the answer that I
2728480	2734800	was given as to why I didn't get my videos back because it had been more than 30 days. And those
2734800	2739120	loopholes that we had found in the 30 day process and all of that sort of stuff, they pointed out,
2739120	2743360	yeah, we're all valid and all really great arguments, but it doesn't change the fact
2743360	2748880	that those videos are gone. And they were like, if we had them, we would give them to you. That
2748880	2756000	is such a fantastic white horse, like knight in shining armor story of being able to really clear
2756000	2761520	our name and make us look a lot better. And there's no reason why we wouldn't give them
2761520	2766400	to you at this point. Like the videos have blown up, everybody's talking about them, it's caused
2766400	2771520	quite the fuss in the office, and there's no reason like we wouldn't just keep them from you
2771520	2776000	because it makes us look worse for the fact that we can't give them back. There's so much we don't
2776000	2780880	know, so much that YouTube doesn't want us to know, but it extends beyond that to things that
2780880	2786160	most YouTube staff employed to talk with the creators barely know about their own company,
2786160	2790400	and thus cannot deal with these problems effectively. YouTube always feels like it's
2790400	2794400	one step behind the issue. Well, multiple steps.
2794400	2798320	As much as I thought mine was terrible, I was getting people sending me screenshots of the
2798320	2803440	fact that their accounts had been dealing with all of this, and they got shut out, and no response for
2803440	2810320	two years. What? This is a failed system, and it's not working. And also through all of this,
2810320	2815360	I found it's not working for me, it's not working for so many creators who have much smaller channels,
2815360	2818800	but also still, it took Shane tweeting for them to care about me. Two million? Not enough.
2818800	2823280	When people first discovered Logan, it was pretty clear that suspicious activity was present,
2823280	2828640	and I can't really blame people for theorising about his nature, which clearly demonstrates some
2828640	2833520	proficiency, but to allege that he was taking control of channels which merely interacted with him
2833520	2838880	before using them to interact with his own channel was likely giving the guy a little too much credit.
2838880	2843360	However, at the same time, if it were a case more local to him, this explanation would be the end of
2843360	2848560	the issue, when really, it was just the start, one that revealed the underbelly of a crooked system,
2848560	2853920	and those who exploit it. But what can be done? Well, let's tie up this discussion.
2858720	2865040	Security online. For many creators, large and small, it's a priceless asset, and one that hopefully
2865040	2870880	we can do a better job of protecting from here on out. I focused on specific examples today,
2870880	2875840	but so many people have lost their channels unnecessarily, even people who I know,
2875840	2880480	and those who did manage to recover them often had to go through excessively stressful scenarios
2880480	2884960	which incurred great cost. In my opinion, regardless of the tricks they've pulled,
2884960	2889440	people like Logan are just the tail end of the snake, and until we aim for the head,
2889440	2895760	we will see a repeat of these sorts of situations. I've already spoken a bit about what YouTube can do,
2895760	2900160	but it's down to them as to how they want to implement prevention measures effectively,
2900160	2905600	and how much they want their teams to be in the know. YouTube has set policy and structure which
2905600	2910320	is primed to provide benefit to those who take advantage of it, whether that's merely botting,
2910320	2914800	or forcefully seizing channels with intrinsic value. Their teams need to have a better grip
2914800	2920000	on these perils, and how to identify the patterns they take, while disseminating necessary warnings
2920000	2925360	to creators when these patterns arise. In these circumstances, everyone does better by knowing
2925360	2930560	a little more. As for the sites, it's hard to really do anything else than make sure the people
2930560	2935440	who you rate aren't having their channel sold off without their knowledge, and if you see someone
2935440	2939920	you know, ask them if they're the owner of the listing. However, we're not going to be on these
2939920	2944960	sites all the time, in fact, I'm sure most of us have no intention to go anywhere near these sites.
2944960	2950240	The truth is, a lot of smaller channels will never be noticed, and I'd recommend a better verification
2950240	2955280	system for these sites to utilise if they do truly care about this stuff, which they may not,
2955280	2961280	so I won't hold my breath. So, what's the final piece of this puzzle? Well, I guess it's where you
2961280	2965840	guys come in, the crater. At the end of the day, these are your accounts, and although it's impossible
2965840	2970640	to guarantee a fully secure account, there are definitely ways to protect it that are worth noting.
2970640	2975520	With that in mind, I think it's time for a feature. When I was a small creator on the platform, there
2975520	2980240	were a few people within the community who I looked up to. Most of these people have either
2980240	2985040	garnered popularity, or left the site without a trace. My guest today is someone who had done the
2985040	2990720	latter for a long time, but recently returned, dropping me a line, and I thought, you know what,
2990720	2995520	you guys might like to meet him. So, ladies and gentlemen, talking about security vulnerability
2995520	3000240	online, and how to prevent it, I present to you, my good friend, Mugcup.
3001600	3007200	Vulnerability online. It's a more prevalent issue now than ever, with classes over platforms like
3007200	3012560	Zoom regularly having their vulnerability tested and pushed, often past their limits.
3013120	3016880	So, what's the solution here? YouTubers should just pick longer passwords, right?
3017760	3023520	No. I mean, yes, you should have a long password, but no, that's not why most instances of YouTube
3023520	3028720	channel theft occur. The fact of the matter is, Google is a ridiculously secure company,
3028720	3033200	in the grand scheme of things, which is to say that it takes quite a bit of doing to get into
3033200	3037360	an account that isn't yours. Brute forcing your way through a password check will just get you to
3037360	3042560	an IP check, and yada yada. Point being, there's a lot of hoops to jump through, and some of those
3042560	3048080	hoops are quite small, you know, because they're like, hard to jump through. You get it. Anyway,
3048080	3052560	so how do YouTube channels get stolen? Well, oftentimes, it's through a process called social
3052560	3058560	engineering, or SE-ing for short. SE-ing is pretty much just getting people to do stuff for you,
3058560	3063280	altering another person's actions with your own social stimulus in the pursuit of a favorable
3063280	3069360	outcome. To try to use this tactic in person, in my opinion, is just neckbeardy bullshit. I know
3069360	3073760	there are some studies about mirroring and its effect on openness, but I am of the firm belief
3073760	3078400	that in any in-person social interaction, you will have infinitely more success being yourself
3078400	3086320	than by playing the game. However, online, because the social stimulus we receive is so vague,
3086320	3090320	generally occurring through text, we are much more vulnerable to social engineering. And yes,
3090320	3094480	I understand that this sounds completely counterintuitive, being more vulnerable on the
3094480	3097600	internet. You would think you would have your guard up all the more, but it's important to
3097600	3102960	remember that when you're navigating the internet, your goal is not always to keep yourself safe from
3102960	3108720	information phishing. It's usually either to work or to entertain yourself. And when you're on
3108720	3113600	YouTube as a small creator, not only is your primary goal not to keep yourself safe from
3113600	3118400	phishing attacks, keeping yourself safe is actually downgraded to at least your tertiary
3118400	3123680	goal with your primary being entertainment and your secondary being success. So we've proven
3123680	3128560	that SE-ing is effective, even though it feels like only an idiot would fall for it. But how does
3128560	3133920	it actually happen? We touched on this a little before, but on YouTube, given that a password isn't
3133920	3139040	enough to steal an account, hackers are going to need a little bit more, making their social
3139040	3145360	engineering attacks go a little bit deeper. While you'll occasionally spot a fake YouTube link,
3145360	3150560	or merch store link, or another weird tailgating attempt from a misspelled PewDiePie,
3150560	3155280	generally the kinds of social engineering schemes that put small creators in the face of danger
3155280	3162240	have a little more nuance. Let's say a guy emails you. He says, hey, this is Chet from YouTube.
3162240	3166560	I tried to log into your account to fix some issues on our backend, but due to your settings,
3166560	3171680	I need you to approve my entry into your account. Don't worry, I'm just updating some things. Like
3171680	3177440	all other Chets, this Chet is a liar. He's not with YouTube. And he's gearing up to get his
3177440	3182640	buttery little hands all over your YouTube channel, either to sell it or to add it to
3182640	3188000	his collection of YouTube channels that he can alluringly spam people with and start the cycle
3188000	3198000	anew with another poor soul. So basically, if you're a small creator, just don't let your
3198000	3204000	excitement lead to your demise. As a small creator on YouTube, the most exciting things are also
3204080	3208960	mixed with the most danger. Case in point, sponsorships. They are the best way to make
3208960	3214400	money on this site these days, but they also come with the most risk, even ignoring all the possible
3214400	3219280	monetary scamming that can occur in these situations. The risk of malware is surprisingly
3219280	3224240	high as fake companies like PollBoost and Nexi will attempt to infect YouTubers computers with
3224240	3230240	remote administration tools or RATS for short. RATS allow the administrator or in this instance,
3230240	3234320	the hacker, scammer, whatever you want to call them, to view all your saved passwords,
3234320	3239040	record your keystrokes, view your webcam, listen to your microphone, speak through your headphones.
3239040	3244880	Any nook and cranny of your privacy essentially can be rifled through by some random guy because
3244880	3249600	you downloaded and opened a program hoping to make some money. So of course, from there,
3249600	3255440	the next logical question is, so how do we avoid that? I know it's scary to risk losing
3255440	3259360	a potential sponsor, but you have to do your research. And if something seems suspicious,
3259360	3263360	you owe it to yourself to take that impulse seriously. Look for the little things,
3263360	3268640	the gaps in professionalism that a legitimate company would never dare show. Advertisers
3268640	3273600	admitting they aren't good at their jobs but will make up for it monetarily is a dead giveaway,
3273600	3280080	and a pretty common one too, as what employee on any actual company email would ever write that?
3280080	3285760	And yet we can see this on proud display in the case of Tech it Easy, a man contacted by
3285760	3291040	a company named Oreo Cleaner Oreo Cleaner. Either way, it doesn't matter. I'm going to spoil it.
3291040	3295840	It's another made up company. And yet again, we see this company representative openly admitting
3295840	3301920	that he's not very good at his job, attempting to explain away his own lack of professionalism,
3301920	3306400	and once again, ensuring that his rat will be downloaded to the victim's hard drive by
3306400	3312320	promising a monetary reward in exchange for a review, a process that requires at the very least
3312320	3318080	a brief look at the software, more than enough time for a rat to take root and steal the data
3318080	3323440	of the content creator in question. Another important point, your phone can get viruses
3323440	3327760	and has a high probability of doing so if you randomly download every app that any rando
3327760	3333840	pretending to be a company sends you. Point being, stay vigilant and follow your instincts. You are
3333840	3339680	not selfish, nor are you stupid for wanting to work with reputable people. A lot of scams will
3339680	3345120	also try to scare you into stupidity by giving you a time limit to take action and avoid a
3345120	3350800	negative result like the loss of your channel or in the case of sponsorships, a loss of income.
3350800	3356480	Even our very own the right opinion had two particularly clever attempts at his channel made
3356480	3362080	with a scammer using a throwaway email with an altered name to make themselves appear to be a
3362080	3368640	YouTube employee in both scams. In the first scam, the right opinion was directed to a phishing link
3368640	3374240	disguised as an altered terms of service with his channel being threatened with deletion. While in
3374240	3379440	the second scam, he was accused of uploading harmful and violent content and it was declared
3379440	3385600	that his channel had a strike. And once again, he was directed to a phishing link, but this time it
3385600	3391280	was disguised as an appeal form. Once again, we see a trend in both of these strategies as they
3391280	3396800	both attempt to induce panic in order to compromise your judgment. But with all scams like these,
3396800	3402560	it's important to remember that YouTube isn't just going to email you about anything significant
3402560	3408160	that happens to your channel. It'll also show up in your YouTube studio or in the case of a terms
3408160	3413680	of service change, it'll likely appear on your homepage. So rather than following any risky links,
3413680	3418080	just type youtube.com into your browser and you will get a version of the site that will not
3418080	3423840	steal your data. Scammers prey on the parts of us that aren't reasonable or rational and loss
3423840	3430960	aversion, the cognitive distortion of value that it is, is certainly neither of those things and is
3430960	3436400	thus often exploited by scammers. In addition to everything we've talked about so far due to how
3436400	3441360	little is known about the wannabe friends comment, a lot of people are suspecting that channels like
3441360	3447280	Logan are using an exploit in the OAuth token system in order to gain people's account permissions
3447280	3452960	without needing to obtain their details. So every time you allow an app to manage your YouTube
3452960	3458080	channel like TubeBuddy or vidIQ, people are currently theorizing that there is an issue
3458080	3462720	with that system. I'm not trying to fear monger, I'm just trying to make you as aware as possible
3462720	3468160	because not a lot is known about this particular scam. So long story short, be wary of any app that
3468160	3473120	you provide with permissions to your account right now as it's being theorized that that system is
3473680	3479600	compromised or compromisable, but who knows for sure. Maybe a hacker, but hopefully not. So to
3479600	3485120	sum it all up, if someone sends you a link, even if it's a slightly misspelled Team YouTube,
3485120	3488720	it's not probably fine. And if you get a sponsorship deal, but it's for a company that
3488720	3493280	you can't find on the internet, or when you do find them, it looks very suspicious, probably
3493280	3497280	avoid that too. And we can definitely get super niche and specific here. But for the sake of not
3497280	3501760	overwhelming you with little things to do on the internet, I'll just condense what I'm saying into
3501760	3507760	a single sentence. Look around before you type in your information. Make sure that the Google login
3507760	3512240	page you're about to use looks like a Google login page, and listen to your antivirus or your
3512240	3514560	browser when it tries to point you in the other direction.
3516240	3521920	Thank you, Mugcup. Thank you for being such a top lad. I hope we all see you around soon, and I hope
3521920	3526080	you imparted the viewers with a little wisdom. I'll be leaving a link in the pinned comment if you
3526080	3531280	guys really did. At the start of this video, we were presented with a problem, one which led to
3531280	3536640	certain interpretations which seemed quite serious, but also slightly reductionist and presumptuous.
3536640	3541840	People identified Logan's antics as the problem rather than the symptom. Although it may well be
3541840	3547120	a problem in itself, it's always good to ask a few questions about how someone could play the system
3547120	3552560	in the way that Logan has. All over YouTube, there is an abundance of boilerplate content set up on
3552560	3557680	the foundations of other channels, aiming to acquire the bag through strong clip baiting content
3557680	3562720	that people won't think twice about. What Logan's, or whichever name they go by at this point,
3562720	3568000	intentions are is unclear, but they seem to be a mere cog in a greater system.
3568000	3571520	Behind the scenes, there are people working round the clock to ring out channels from
3571520	3576800	unsuspecting small and medium-sized creators, those who may not be too familiar with the trickery
3576800	3581600	operated by these fiends. When these people notice, it's often after they've lost access to their
3581600	3586720	account and respective emails, and their means of finding help is limited. YouTube's response has
3586720	3591040	often been lackluster, typically relying on a rudimentary checklist which has occasionally
3591040	3595600	failed to diagnose the problem altogether, even when it appears flagrantly obvious.
3595600	3600160	This was revealed most sensationally in Megan Rink's video, but can be attested in the
3600160	3602560	rants of many other frustrated creators.
3602560	3608640	The main thing that pissed me off the most was losing my true channel. I went fucking insane in like
3608640	3615200	the last coffee in six weeks, not gonna lie. Insane as in, I had no control over my emotions anymore.
3616160	3623040	And they got pressed. That's basically what happened. Depressed to the point where I could relate
3623040	3627040	myself to a 14-year-old fucking me who had suicidal problems.
3627040	3632080	Given YouTube is about as transparent as they ever are, it's hard to know whether they've truly
3632080	3636720	ameliorated people's concerns, but I hope they are at least a bit more conscious of the matters
3636720	3639040	highlighted in this video, and others.
3639040	3645040	And Google and YouTube support were just taking me in circles, telling me to do the same thing over and over again.
3645040	3653040	Completely useless, like, completely useless. So finally, on the tenth day, ten days, the account recovery
3653040	3659040	comes through, and I get my account back. So, thank you Google, even though you didn't really help that much.
3659040	3664960	Well, that's faster than before. Nonetheless, it's best not to rely on corporations to look out for you,
3664960	3666800	it doesn't always end too well.
3666800	3671760	Take all necessary precautions to safeguard your account from malicious actors, and be sure not to fall
3671760	3676880	for any of the machinations which may seem credible to the untrained eye. If you do this, not only do you
3676880	3681920	protect your own account, but you allow YouTube to perhaps dedicate more time to those who have fallen victim.
3681920	3686720	Emphasis on the perhaps, I shan't speak too unequivocally on their priorities.
3686720	3692080	The internet is an evolving place with evolving problems, and we need to evolve with it.
3692320	3697680	It's strange how a simple question from an appearingly unexceptional account can cause so much concern
3697680	3703520	in a community. That concern is justified, but sometimes misplaced. Sometimes the truth is a little less
3703520	3710000	far-fetched, and a little more, well, preventable. So, how secure is your account online?
3710000	3715760	Well, that's down to you. All I'll say is, don't find out the hard way. Before you know it, your account might be
3715760	3721840	transformed into a comment bot, or even worse, a half-assed top 10 compilation channel.
3721840	3724400	That is no way for a man to meet his fate.
3745760	3750960	That's enough, I need to thank my Patrons, the $10 Patrons are up on screen right now, thank you guys for your
3750960	3757600	support and contribution, I really appreciate it, but also the $50 Patrons, Somehuller Blue, Caroline,
3757600	3765440	Hypercube, Amanda, Devon, Shirochigo, Vertex Avenger, and Doug Nolan, with extra special thanks to my $100
3765440	3771680	Patrons, Christopher Karras, and Ileana Banana, what a charming name, thank you so much for your support,
3771680	3778800	it really means a hell of a lot, you guys are top-notch, top-notch people, keep it up, thank you for your
3778800	3785840	continued support. Anyhow, I don't have too much else to add, if you wanna find me on my social medias,
3785840	3791680	they'll be in the pinned comment Discord, Twitter, I'm not using Facebook right now, but you can still follow
3791680	3796480	if you want. Anyhow, I don't have too much else to say, but I hope you guys take care of yourself,
3796480	3801200	and I'm The Right Opinion, I'll see you in the next one.
