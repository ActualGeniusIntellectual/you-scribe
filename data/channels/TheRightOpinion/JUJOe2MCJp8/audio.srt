00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,240
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,960
and Autumn, it's not far away now, and soon I'm sure that we will be basking in the Autumn leaves like the outdoorsy people we are.

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,000
However, for the moments you've probably chosen to delay your joyous pastimes and watch this video,

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,960
in which we will discuss a curious comment that was brought to my attention recently, and the interesting rabbit hole it can take us down.

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:34,200
Security online is something that a lot of us value as a personal liberty for our privacy and our safety.

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,640
In the last decade, security online has taken multiple steps forward, but as large platforms are taking steps to protect their users,

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,640
hackers are never too far behind, always looking for methods to stir up trouble, whether that's attempting to obtain user data,

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,400
or merely hijack someone's account for comedic purposes.

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,640
Plenty of sites have encountered data breaches, and it's an unfortunate hazard that some are clearly ill-prepared for.

10
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,960
However, as much as hackers obtaining user data justifiably causes concern on a macro basis,

11
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,680
I think people are much more protective over the possession of their personal accounts,

12
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,920
because our personal accounts, regardless of size or influence, often pertain great personal value to us,

13
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,360
as a platform that can represent our thoughts, feelings, and even our creative ventures.

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,200
It's a piece of us. That sort of thing can definitely be exemplified with one's YouTube account.

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,640
Now, of course, many people merely create YouTube accounts for the purposes of commenting, subscribing, and following content,

16
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,280
however, for many people, a YouTube account allows us to express ourselves,

17
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:34,000
and even if we're projecting our content towards a large audience, it's still a product which feels deeply intimate to us,

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,600
which is why people care about others when they have their channels unnecessarily terminated or restricted.

19
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,040
We like to think that all in all, YouTube, in spite of their flaws, have a grip on keeping their accounts secure,

20
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,720
however, when you look at their track record, this could be called into contention.

21
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,720
I understand why you're wondering that the investigation resulted that no hijacking activity happened on the channel,

22
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,960
however, I can assure you that our internal team carefully investigated this, and didn't found any.

23
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,360
Didn't. Found. Any.

24
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,040
Over the last few years, many creators have reported their channel stolen, and subsequently used for less than dignified purposes,

25
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,960
in fact, it seems to be an overwhelmingly common occurrence for many users.

26
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,800
Now, when you have so many channels on a website like YouTube, it seems inevitable that some accounts will be hacked or stolen,

27
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,800
but today we're looking at an issue that transcends a few occurrences, and outlines a trend which appears pervasive on the platform,

28
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,160
and encompassed by one account, which went by the name of Logan.

29
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,000
If you follow any smaller creators, you'll have almost definitely seen this line of text in their comment section,

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,120
I can without a doubt say it's the widest spread comment I've ever seen, but it's so much more malicious than it seems on the surface.

31
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,160
In the small YouTuber world, attention and friends can be hard to come by, so when you're uploading content,

32
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,080
it's easy to be particularly receptive to anybody who may provide you with attention, especially larger channels.

33
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,280
However, for anyone who does have experience with being a smaller creator, you'll know that you have to regularly deal with comments

34
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:08,240
that from a cursory perspective seem fairly friendly, but often just reflect a veiled attempt to gain subscribers from inexperienced users.

35
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,120
Now, those who have familiarity with YouTube will tell you that this technique is rather redundant,

36
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,920
and most creators partaking in this will breed no longevity on their content, because you're just cultivating a load of dormant subscribers,

37
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,640
numbers really aren't everything on that front. Nonetheless, this doesn't stop people from trying,

38
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,800
and over the years, desperate creators have manufactured various automated techniques in an attempt to garner likes, views, and subs,

39
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,000
and eventually monetization. On the surface, this is what appears to be the case with the account named Logan,

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,560
a creator commenting on numerous uploads by smaller creators, with a simple three-word proposition, wannabe friends.

41
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,040
And with such an enticing offer, who wouldn't want to be friends with this lovely gent?

42
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,920
In times like these, we could use a good friend, like the lovely fellow Logan here.

43
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,960
However, as many of you have predicted, this comment was made by a bot, likely incapable of developing a meaningful friendship,

44
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,440
and Logan himself was merely publishing substandard content on how to grow your channel.

45
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,480
So what was the point? Was it merely farming views, or was it something a little more sinister?

46
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:16,880
Yeah, the real way he growed his channel so large was using bots, they're all bots, but bots using real accounts, your accounts actually.

47
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,360
Well, on the 13th of May, a YouTuber by the name of evans111 uploaded a video with the subtitle,

48
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,120
The Most Dangerous Comment on YouTube, referring to Logan's comment in question. How could such a comment be dangerous?

49
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,240
Well, according to Evan, it appears that creators who interact with this comment risk having their channel stolen,

50
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,560
and subsequently used in Logan's view farming ploy to boost his own YouTube channel.

51
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,040
Go on to his videos, and there were a plethora of generic, vague comments which appear to barely interact with the video at all,

52
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,000
and only lend credence to the idea that something is not quite right with the project that Logan is running.

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,280
Wanna be friends?

54
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:59,680
Somehow, this guy developed a way of hacking people's channels solely by having them subscribe to him, and this is incredibly alarming.

55
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:07,120
All these accounts posting these fake comments are real accounts, so this plague can go unnoticed by YouTube,

56
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,640
and his channel can thrive with nobody knowing how. This is not okay.

57
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:19,280
Evan postulates that this Logan character has created a bot which can take control of accounts who interact with its initial comment.

58
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,680
He warns people to not respond or react in any way. If this was true, it would be a huge breach in YouTube security,

59
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:33,360
and not one that can be ignored, and it wasn't. In barely any time at all, Logan's account vanished, and he became another YouTube relic.

60
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:40,880
All's well that ends well, right? Well, not entirely. The fact is that the perception of Logan presented may not be the entire truth,

61
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:48,320
and I'll explain why very soon. In spite of all the comments disappearing, Logan's channel was very much alive, it had merely shapeshifted a little.

62
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,520
So why aren't people doing more about this hacker? Well, probably because he may well not be a hacker.

63
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:01,760
However, take a look at the evidence today, and you'll find a truth perhaps more alarming, and one that should encourage awareness from YouTubers and YouTube alike.

64
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:22,080
So, to commence this interesting tale, we need to go back a few months, to a time when your boy Tro was a wide-eyed nipper who could still leave his house for leisure purposes.

65
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:30,960
Yes, in early 2020, I was dealing with an issue that I considered mostly internal at the time, however, this led me to investigate channels which I considered compromised.

66
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:38,800
However, one comment that appeared on multiple uploads was a comment by a channel named Tem, if you're wondering this character's relevance, all will be revealed.

67
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:47,440
When I clicked on Tem's channel, I was greeted by a similar video to that which was documented by Evans, in fact, the format was identical, the only thing different was the name.

68
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:54,480
Yo, what is going on, guys? My name is Tem R, and in this video, I'm gonna be showing you guys how to grow your YouTube channel just like I did.

69
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,720
So as you can see, I have gained a lot of subs for the past few days, and the pa-

70
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,960
The uploads that I was greeted by at the time were extremely bland uploads about how you could gain subscribers' views and traffic.

71
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:15,360
After all, this Tem guy was an expert, anyone who can secure tens of thousands of views on content with the personality of a grapefruit must be pulling off some impressive algorithmic massaging.

72
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:24,160
However, there was an additional parallel that could be drawn between these two channels, the comments section, which was also predominantly occupied with rote responses from small channels.

73
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:35,040
The only real difference is that some of these comments seem a bit more fleshed out, although many still represent a similar level of mental vacancy, however, there may be a reason for this which I'll soon divulge.

74
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:45,280
At this point, you're probably coming to the conclusion that Tem and Logan have both been drawing from the same framework, however, it goes one step further than that, because Tem and Logan are in fact the same person.

75
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,920
I'll give you a moment to let that sink in.

76
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:57,040
The voices were identical, and so was the format of the content, and now this isn't a huge surprise.

77
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,240
So Tem and Logan are the same person, big deal, but there are a couple more curious observations that we can make.

78
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:11,360
Firstly, this isn't the only channel, in fact, his highly successful Tips and Tricks channel was launched off the back of another channel which was at that point going by the same name.

79
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:26,880
So if you click on Tem, you'll see, oh wow, this channel has like 500,000 subscribers, that's crazy, usually people will go and see what videos they uploaded, but these aren't Tem's videos, you can see that this channel has no videos uploaded.

80
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:34,720
It was an interesting setup, basically, he had a playlist of his content, but it was being promoted through a different channel, why on earth would he be doing that?

81
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:42,800
Well, probably to loophole the YouTube guidelines, you see, his first channel here had obtained subscribers fairly fraudulently, but barely had any videos.

82
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:54,240
This is MrBeast, and this isn't MrBeast, but why isn't it? To the passive viewer, it appears to be his channel, it has his videos accordingly located, with the complementary view counts,

83
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:02,560
however, this is a classic trick used by the charlatans, they create a playlist, call it uploaded videos, and then position it at the forefront of the channel.

84
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,640
You can typically identify these channels by a lack of featured video, and the concealed subscriber count, often, I must add.

85
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:18,400
However, for the casual user, they may not notice, and come to the conclusion that they've been unsubscribed by YouTube's eternally faulty system, an understandable assumption, but an incorrect one.

86
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:30,480
Tem, or Logan, or Tom, or Todd, or fake MrBeast would then implement his bot to comment on smaller YouTubers who may find themselves starstruck in the moment, and not think to question the legitimacy of this account.

87
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:38,000
He pulled this off for a while, and ended up with over 100,000 subscribers, however, if you go back further, you'll realise that this wasn't even the case,

88
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:46,080
and that he was previously an account known as Trap Town, who was also notorious amongst communities, for guess what, doing exactly the same thing.

89
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:53,920
If you've got a YouTube channel, they'll send you a nice little message saying that they like your video, and they'll ask you, hey do you want to be a YouTube friend?

90
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:01,280
Now you might be asking yourself, what's a YouTube friend? They're basically asking, if you subscribe to my channel, I'll subscribe to yours.

91
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:08,480
YouTube frowns on this, some people call it sub for sub, now the problem comes in if you subscribe to their channel.

92
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,400
Now if you go to their website to subscribe, when you get to their channel, it looks like a normal channel.

93
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:23,840
Now notice, you can't tell how many people have already subscribed. Now let me show you what's really weird, when you click on videos, there's no videos on this channel.

94
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,440
They want you to subscribe, now the problem comes in what they do with your information.

95
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:37,760
From what I understand, they start by selling your information, and with dishonest people like this, who knows what else they'll do with it.

96
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:45,200
The creator who uploaded this video, Liv Free, alleges that if you subscribe to them, they acquire your information, and supposedly sell it on.

97
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,880
There is no accompanying evidence shown, and to be honest, this guy doesn't seem completely certain what their motives are.

98
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:57,600
The internet is a dangerous place out there. You want to protect yourself and others, and that's why I've got this video out here.

99
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:04,720
Chances are if you're watching this, they've already hit your channel, just do yourself and everybody else a favour, stay clear.

100
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:13,200
One of the strangest things is that in spite of this mass live subscriber farming campaign, if you look at one of the Social Blade archives that I saved before the channels were shut down,

101
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:23,520
you'd notice they almost certainly bought subscribers for their channel. At some point, you can see the uploaded video, but heaven knows what that video was, it seems they were set uploading on this other channel.

102
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:31,120
So after he had accrued enough subscribers, Tem decided to launch his channel, where he provides rather useless advice for the budding creator.

103
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:41,280
Now, for most people, when they want to create a new channel, they would just create it, right? Well, not here. In fact, I saved an old archive of the channel listing which Tem subsequently purchased.

104
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:49,200
Before this, it was a channel by the name of Xerox, who had just over 2,500 subscribers, and had the channel on the market for $200.

105
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:58,240
So as we understand, Tem bought a channel worth $200 who had 2,500 subscribers to launch his channel, which he'd promote using the 150,000 subscriber channel.

106
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:07,200
So why would a person fork out a couple hundred for a channel which appeared no different to a clean slate? Two words, monetization enabled.

107
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:14,720
A few years back, YouTube restricted monetization so that only channels above a certain threshold of subscribers and watch time could apply for monetization.

108
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:22,480
Now, if you were to acquire views through fraudulent methods, this may be identified when one applies for monetization, so by obtaining some real subscribers,

109
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:29,680
and then buying this second pre-monetized channel, it allows Tem to promote monetized content, and make the methods appear more above board.

110
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,880
However, it's just a rather elaborate ploy to bypass the protections that YouTube have in place for this.

111
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:42,880
So Logan wanted to make a buck through a rather complex scheme, but if you're aware of the original narrative, you may begin to formulate some questions.

112
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,240
What business would a hacker have in buying a channel? Surely he'd just hack one.

113
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,080
And to that, my friends, I'd say, good question. Well, let's see if we can crack this confusing case.

114
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,920
With the evidence that we have assembled currently, does the idea that this Logan guy is a seasoned hacker really stack up?

115
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,440
Well, obviously, he's operating some sort of enterprise which involves less than kosher methods of acquiring traffic,

116
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,960
but is he the individual hacking all these channels which appear on his videos, or is he just the buyer?

117
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:29,920
Obviously, it is a possibility that Tem was the individual who listed the channel before removing the listing and deciding to use the channel himself,

118
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,440
as the seller doesn't actually have any sales to his name. However, the transaction may have been done off-site,

119
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,200
and it also doesn't explain the unusual methods of procuring people's data, which would have been done through interaction.

120
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,560
There was no established correlation between the channels who Logan commented on, and the channels that had been compromised.

121
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,880
If Logan had installed a bot that commented on multiple channels' videos, and some of those channels were subsequently targeted for hacking,

122
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,120
then of course, it may lead some people to believe that Logan was the individual who hacked their channel.

123
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:04,960
Correlation, however, does not imply causation. Nonetheless, it seems an exceptionally strange system being run by this mysterious character,

124
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,960
and he had developed a comment bot, so he must have a degree of technical proficiency, unless it wasn't his, which it may not have been.

125
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,800
As if this project wasn't complex enough as it was, around the time that Tem's videos concerning channel growth were released,

126
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,960
there was another person by the name of The Comical Canadian, who uploaded videos with nearly identical titles and thumbnails.

127
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:29,760
The Comical Canadian's channel was focused around gaming, however, he was also notorious among smaller creators for operating a similar comment bot,

128
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:36,240
as well as allegedly conducting spam streams in an attempt to solicit subscriptions and money from unsuspecting users.

129
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:43,600
So this guy is not only scamming people out of their money, I mean, I guess if you donate to him, you know, whatever,

130
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:51,840
but he's constantly got all this, like, fake giveaway, fake shoutout, well, maybe not fake shoutout, I haven't done enough research into him,

131
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:59,360
but fake giveaways, right? And these kids that are watching him are probably only, like, 10.

132
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,680
You know, it pisses me off when I see someone like this scamming little kids out of their money.

133
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,520
In an interview with another small creator, he states that he'd been conducting business the way he has for financial benefit,

134
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:20,400
and I suppose it makes sense. This then ties back to our friend Vaxxie, or Logan, who is using a similar technique, with a few, well, giveaways.

135
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:27,040
If we look here, in one of these videos by Vaxxie himself, he mentions a Fortnite code, code Canadian.

136
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:33,360
Remember to type in code Canadian in the Fortnite item shop and subscribe and hit the bell so I can send you a gift.

137
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:41,360
And remember, the comical Canadian was using an interesting code back in the day, about a month ago. Oh, code Canadian. It's the same guy.

138
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,880
However, once again, it doesn't seem like much hacking comes into it. I know how much he made from this method,

139
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,560
and I never had the privilege of watching his streams in action, but it's possible that this bloke alongside Timothy

140
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:59,760
had been reinvesting their money into new get rich quick schemes, which they run as long as they can until YouTube notices these antics.

141
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:05,760
It's smash and grab content creation. Another creator, Timeworks, made a good video on his theory for why they're doing it,

142
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,240
which comes down to the value of channels.

143
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,800
Timeworks- Yeah, this is a subscriber farm. They're growing channels, gaining hundreds of thousands of subscribers,

144
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:21,200
and then, I would assume, selling the channels for a profit. More recently, we've heard of people hacking channels,

145
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,960
and then selling them, but this is a more efficient way, because no one's actually getting harmed here.

146
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:36,080
It's just one big sort of scam spam thing, and they make a lot of money by selling these channels that they sort of grow.

147
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,960
He provides good running commentary on the creators of these bots, who have recently come back under the name

148
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:46,240
Bananarama, and many others, and even conducted an interview with one of the people involved.

149
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,800
If you want to know what the dude is up to, then definitely check it out. It seems they buy the channel,

150
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,400
do what they plan on doing, with an undisclosed goal.

151
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,720
So the next very important question I asked is, do people get hacked in all of this?

152
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,680
And I asked it right away, because I knew that this was a major concern for the whole YouTube community.

153
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,440
And so Supremacy said, straight off the bat, no. The only hacking here that's going on is false information.

154
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:17,440
So he did mention some other people, like Evans, who was mentioned in the whole Logan wannabe friend situation.

155
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:23,680
So he said that Optimus was lying for clout, Evans is confusing, and so he went on to defend a bunch of things,

156
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,000
why they do not hack your channel. Now of course, they could be lying to you.

157
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,760
I personally don't think they actually do, but you know, they lie to you when they say wannabe friends.

158
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,320
So this actually could be a lie, I don't know. Do you know what happens to channels when it's done being used?

159
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,360
Because the Vaxi channel is sort of off doing its whole loop to live stream thing, so like, do they

160
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,920
actually sell the channels? That's what I was trying to get at. Why is Vaxi off doing something else now?

161
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,160
And they didn't answer, and that's where the interview sort of ended.

162
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,480
Now, that would explain a majority of the shenanigans utilised by this curious couple.

163
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,560
However, we can't necessarily ignore the fact that hacking has been involved somewhere.

164
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:10,480
When you look at the comments on the uploads, these are not just phantom accounts that were never occupied by anyone real.

165
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:17,040
These were not merely bots, these are real people who make real content, having their accounts hijacked on an unprecedented scale.

166
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:22,080
However, it doesn't stop there, because then we need to take a look at that $200 transaction that Tem made.

167
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,600
Now, on the surface, there's not too much to say. There was a channel up for sale, someone bought it, no questions, eh?

168
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,920
Well, there are a few quibbles that one might raise.

169
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,800
Now, firstly, as I understand it, selling your channel is a violation of YouTube's terms of service,

170
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:40,320
and it's something you can find on the relevant page. Although they don't seem to take a particularly strong stance about it,

171
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,520
it seems that selling it on third-party websites comes into conflict with their AdSense policy.

172
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,440
This makes sense for obvious reasons, because people could just buy a monetized channel,

173
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,640
and begin posting content that YouTube did not approve. However, this is more YouTube's PR problem.

174
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,760
What boils down to being a creator-oriented problem is what you can find by digging a little further.

175
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,760
YouTube channels have value, they've always held some value, but if you look beyond the individual listings for that account,

176
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,160
you'll find a website flogging various accounts for varying prices known as Axe Market.

177
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,160
They're selling YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Telegram, and Twitter accounts.

178
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,200
Now, this website does have a verification procedure to make sure you have access to the account you're selling.

179
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,040
However, if someone is infiltrated that account to use it for malicious purposes,

180
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,080
this is not a really sufficient means of confirmation.

181
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,720
One of the most expensive listings, a wrestling channel with just under 500,000 subscribers,

182
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,000
has one comment which informs people that the channel has been hacked.

183
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,480
This does not necessarily mean the channel was hacked, though it's certainly not a good omen.

184
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,440
On top of this, a fair few listings have the disclaimer that there was no confirmation provided at all,

185
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,880
which confuses me as to why there's even a listing in that instance.

186
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,440
Some posters on these sites seem to have multiple listings, many of them thematically dissonant,

187
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,880
not the sort of channels that one would merely feel like selling at once.

188
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,480
The website also has a feature where you can notify them that the channel is yours,

189
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,000
and you want to delete the listing.

190
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,160
However, unless you're made aware prior to the sale, then you would never know to react,

191
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,640
and even then it would rely on you deducing that your channel's been hacked and was being sold,

192
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,560
and then finding the marketplace.

193
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,360
Channels with an online presence that may boost their algorithmic potential can be very profitable,

194
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,040
particularly ones which have monetisation enabled, because as mentioned earlier,

195
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,040
it is now a non-inclusive feature, so people wanting to have that boost,

196
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,960
people like Tem, will obviously see the appeal in these websites.

197
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,360
For example, the person who purchased a channel by the name of TBBAP,

198
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,640
otherwise known as Two Best Brothers Bitch About Ponies,

199
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,760
they were highly unsatisfied with their purchase because after a few weeks,

200
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,600
they lost access to the account.

201
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,280
Why was this? Well, it's because the channels were stolen from a large group of creators

202
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,480
who actually had the clout to attract YouTube's attention, and after a month,

203
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,440
they managed to regain ownership of what was rightfully theirs,

204
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,120
which obviously upset the buyer. My heart does weep.

205
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,760
Many creators will never possess this privilege, and with YouTube's policy making pre-established

206
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,080
monetised channels more lucrative and important than ever, scammers are attempting to take

207
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,160
advantage of this business, and then flogging these channels online to clients like Tem

208
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,240
who want a shortcut to stardom.

209
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,880
The strange thing is, I don't have a problem with people selling their channels on principle.

210
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,560
Although I do see why it's against the terms of service, it makes complete sense,

211
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,480
there's no way that YouTube would be able to universally enforce such a policy,

212
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,800
so the best thing they can do is focus on those whose accounts have been compromised

213
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,600
and work towards recovering them, right? Well.

214
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:38,560
YouTube has a waringly impersonal relationship with a majority of their creators.

215
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,040
It's unavoidable to a point, but there has to be a stage where YouTube starts to listen to people

216
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,600
who represent the majority of full-time partners, not just the mainstream TV imports,

217
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,000
and not just the YouTube goliaths, because creators from different echelons are likely

218
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,720
to face different problems. A lot of scammers tend to benefit most off small channels,

219
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,000
mainly because they're the ones that you can seize with the fewest repercussions.

220
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,280
The creators are more unacquainted with the particularities of YouTube,

221
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,920
thus making them more vulnerable, and once they've lost their channels,

222
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,680
they have much less power to bring it to YouTube's attention. A lot of these channels

223
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,680
tend to be inactive as well, which means the creator may not even be paying attention to

224
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,240
what happens with it. However, more than enough times a channel is targeted which involves a

225
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,720
somewhat influential YouTuber, or an individual who is part of a great community which will

226
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,920
amplify their endeavor.

227
00:22:52,720 --> 00:23:06,480
I could explore the numerous anecdotes which tell us about the issue,

228
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,240
and how YouTube handled it. However, the most notable example from the last 12 months was

229
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,720
created by the name of Megan Riggs, a beauty YouTuber with over 2 million subscribers.

230
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,120
In a series of videos, she speaks about an ordeal which involved her channels being stolen,

231
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,760
and YouTube's somewhat sloppy approach to the situation,

232
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:56,560
I'm going to try and keep it brief, but after her main account was breached,

233
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,560
it was hidden from a number of her subscribers, who notified her immediately. This then led to

234
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,640
a drawn out exchange with Team YouTube, who repeatedly sent her the wrong instructions

235
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,360
to resolve it.

236
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,240
Until today, when I sent over, hey, this one video on that channel seems weird, they say,

237
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:46,640
oh, wow, our bad, we've been looking into the vlog channel. I don't know about you guys,

238
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,440
but to me, it doesn't really make a lot of sense. Not only had I filled out all of those

239
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:58,240
forms and questions about my main channel, the channels don't have the same or similar URLs,

240
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,760
they're not attached to the same email addresses, and we haven't been talking about that one.

241
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,600
They apologize for the snafu, the mix-up, the kerfuffle, and then they proceed to send me

242
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,640
the steps to unhide my channel. They also acknowledge that these are the exact same

243
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,960
steps that they had sent me previously and sent the screen recordings out. So essentially,

244
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,000
we are back at square one, where we were at on October 24th, and it's November 9th.

245
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,920
Despite being offended, I cleared my cookies in my cachet, and surprise, it didn't work. And then,

246
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,240
as if I wasn't about to lose it already, I get an email in which they said,

247
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,360
this would be the final attempt to unhide my channel. So this final attempt, you would think,

248
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,000
balls to the wall, something we haven't tried before, risky, things might go wrong. No,

249
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,680
it's the same link to unhide my channel that they sent me before, the same basic instructions on how

250
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:55,120
to unhide a YouTube channel that anybody can access. November 11th, they then realize that

251
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:01,280
they've sent me the wrong link. Oh, our bad, we sent you the wrong link.

252
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,240
Not laughing. They then provide me with another link to unhide my YouTube channel, and guess what?

253
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,160
It works. Do you know why? Because it's a completely different link than they had sent me

254
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:17,440
all of these previous times to unhide my channel. It is also a link that cannot be accessed unless

255
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,240
you have a direct link. You need someone from YouTube to send you this link directly for you

256
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:28,880
to be able to even see this part of the site, a link. So instead, it took from October 24th

257
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,800
to November 11th for my channel to be fully reinstated, when all I needed was a link.

258
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,120
This was already a bit of a shambles, however, in this instance, the hackers were particularly

259
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,280
persistent and eventually gained access to Megan's second account, her vlog channel,

260
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,960
changing the login before she could even react, then selling it on a forum for the grand fee of $500.

261
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:55,040
And this would be the first of several compilation videos of pretty obviously stolen content,

262
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,680
which are accompanied by a bunch of comments, which seem totally legit,

263
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,760
very much pertaining to the content of the video. Definitely human.

264
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:11,200
And definitely from the 500,000 people that had been subscribed to this YouTube channel.

265
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,400
Sound similar? I thought so. This channel then rebrands to Beauty Dior, and begins uploading

266
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,200
copyrighted content. This then triggers thousands of people to unsubscribe, as the audience didn't

267
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,280
recognise the channel, and wouldn't want anything to do with such meritless content. With a

268
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,120
sufficient level of evidence, it becomes quite apparent that this channel is no longer in

269
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,520
Megan's possession, so if it isn't too difficult for any casual observer to see the problem,

270
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,640
then YouTube shouldn't have too much trouble either, should they?

271
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,920
Not to mention, with a quick search, you could tell that this URL was my vlog channel,

272
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:46,400
which seemed to be much simpler than explaining over the course of nearly a month of emails what

273
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:51,440
a hidden channel looks like. This time, I have so much more ammo. Literally, it's been rebranded.

274
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,240
There's a whole other name, there's a description, there's a video up. I feel like this is like open

275
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,960
and shut case. Well, apparently so. After escalating the issue to their internal team,

276
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,000
they conducted an extensive investigation, and came to the resounding conclusion that there was

277
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,200
no suspicious activity. What?

278
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:16,240
So then between February 13th and February 21st, there have been multiple emails exchanged. Lots

279
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,240
of these very human responses from YouTube giving me updates that don't say anything,

280
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,240
and lots of my manager being like, hey, what's going on? We need to figure this out. Then

281
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,120
February 22nd comes around, and YouTube had finally figured it out. Actually, first,

282
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,000
my manager had followed up yet again, and they responded to that email with their findings.

283
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,960
Hi there. Thanks for the prompt response. This case was opened because this second channel of

284
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,000
Megan was claimed hacked. We asked our internal team to do an investigation about this report.

285
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,920
We just got an update from our team that after our investigation,

286
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,480
we can state that there were no signs of abnormal activity found in the channel.

287
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,360
Feel free to email us back if you have any other concerns.

288
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,040
The fact that I am not Beauty Dior, this is not my channel, and this has clearly been hacked.

289
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,440
I understand why you're wondering that the investigation resulted that no hijacking

290
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,240
activity happened on the channel. However, I can assure you that our internal team carefully

291
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:24,320
investigated this and didn't found any. Didn't found any. To help keep your account safe in the

292
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,040
future, please view these tips on how to create a strong password and give your account extra

293
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,520
security here. Sorry that I don't have good news for you, but if you have other concerns,

294
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:39,280
let us know. They are telling me that my YouTube account has not been hacked,

295
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,560
and then they give me the steps to protect my YouTube account from being hacked.

296
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,360
The YouTube account that I don't have access to because it has been hacked.

297
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,200
Yes, it seems that in spite of the deluge of verification that Megan displays,

298
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,160
the very professional specialist cybermonkeys of the eternal team were not won over. On top of

299
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,640
this, a lot of YouTube's correspondence could be described as a bit incompetent.

300
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,200
Hi, Alex. How's it going?

301
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,560
I want to let you know that there's about 10 people on this email chain. No one's name is

302
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:44,000
Alex. There's no Alexander. There's no Alexandra. I've never spoken to an Alex at YouTube. I'm

303
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,680
Alex. Bob here, stepping in for Chad today, who has been so eager to resolve your case.

304
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,080
Have you been? Have you been so eager? You've clearly done so much. I just wanted you to know

305
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:59,200
that our eyes are all glued on our case. Let me remind you that I haven't been on these emails

306
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,880
since the end of January, so I only get these sent later. My manager's assistant responds with,

307
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,080
thanks, the manager's name is, and the client's name is Megan Rinks. Nobody's named Alex here.

308
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,280
Hi, apologies. My last email was meant for you and not someone by the name of Alex.

309
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,400
Thanks for understanding.

310
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,640
In response, Megan decides that there's only one option, which is to openly drag YouTube,

311
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,720
because as many creators have experienced, is often the only way to make them actually

312
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,280
take notice. So she tweets out her frustrations, and eventually, with the help of Shane Dawson

313
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:34,480
and Gigi Hadid, Megan initiates a conversation with the Team YouTube Twitter account. However,

314
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,280
this conversation was equally confusing and unsatisfying, particularly with mine to the

315
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:44,960
emails she was now being sent. But they then also informed me that they will be marking this case

316
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:52,080
a high priority. Again, the emails we had previously talked about, we were done. It was

317
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,840
done. Nothing had happened, but it wasn't until Shane tweeted, they were like, actually, we're

318
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,720
going to make this a high priority. Make what high priority? I thought this case, did you,

319
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,680
are we doing it again? Prior to this, there was no suspicious activity. They couldn't found any.

320
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,240
Case was pretty much closed. Is it a weird coincidence that this new email comes with them

321
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,520
marking this case as high priority, just a mere hour after Shane tweeted, and also then talked

322
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:19,680
to his personal YouTube rep about it? What do you think? Seems a little sus to me. Eventually,

323
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:24,400
over two months after her channel was stolen, YouTube emailed her a resolution on how to

324
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:30,880
recover her channel. Fantastic. Well, not quite. You see, there was a catch. Hi there, I hope you're

325
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,040
having a good day in spite of the issue you're having with your channel. My name is Tim, and I

326
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,200
will be working on your case for the time being. To get started, we need these information from you

327
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,320
in order for us to transfer the channel ownership back to you. Why weren't these steps going on

328
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,360
before? This is the legal template, and we would really appreciate it if you can fill this out

329
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,800
soon as for us to start the process of transferring your channel to your new email address. I'm sorry,

330
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,120
fast for you, because you took months to do this, and also, you had given up? You can transfer an

331
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,560
account back to me, and you weren't even going to f***ing tell me? Are you f***ing kidding?

332
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,760
Personal Google account slash email address. Please provide the email address if you have it.

333
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,040
Enter address or link. This account cannot already have a channel on it. Please certify that you're

334
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,880
the owner of this channel. Please certify that you have the commercial use rights to all content

335
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,320
contained on the account. Please certify there are no ongoing outstanding debts, arrangements,

336
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,280
or contractual obligations still pending regarding this channel. It's definitely still

337
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,400
in content, but I didn't steal it. Please certify that you're understanding that we will delete

338
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,680
personal data associated with the original channel prior to transfer. That includes the following.

339
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,280
Private videos, private and unlisted playlists. All of my videos are private! You're just gonna

340
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,840
delete them? Why? To the extent permitted by applicable law, I agree to defend,

341
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,680
identify, and hold harmless YouTube, impairing corporation, officers, directors, employees,

342
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,680
and agents, form and against any all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities,

343
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,800
costs or debt, and expenses, including but not limited to attorney fees arising from the

344
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,160
content on this channel, the uses of this account, and or any claim that my content

345
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:48,400
caused damage to a third party. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive these

346
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:53,280
terms and my use of the YouTube service. So if you didn't catch that, the email YouTube just sent

347
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,240
is that I can have my channel and they're transferred over to me. I just have to agree to

348
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,920
not sue them, and also I can't have any of the videos that were privated, which is all of them.

349
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:09,040
Literally why? I don't want beauty to yours videos. However, it wasn't really much of a catch,

350
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,760
because as she would later observe, such an email could not possibly be legally binding for a

351
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,880
multitude of reasons. So the video goes live, and there's a load more debauchery, which I shan't

352
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,960
delve into. If you want to watch the videos, you know where to find them. So after the video,

353
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,240
and after all the publicity, YouTube manages to scramble together two options, presented to

354
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,720
Megan in a phone call. The first option being that, as the hacker has deleted all the videos,

355
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:37,040
Megan can send them all her old videos, and YouTube will upload them all at once,

356
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,520
following the restoration of the channel. Megan can't really agree to this option as she doesn't

357
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,280
have her old uploads, YouTube was her archive for that content. So the second option, yes,

358
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,440
this one being that YouTube can delete the channel and let Megan make a new one,

359
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,400
an option which Megan doesn't seem particularly thrilled by.

360
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:59,040
Megan- How is that helping? Also, again, I don't really have plans on uploading to this channel,

361
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,680
I just want the videos. Would I love if the channel was intact with the videos there?

362
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,240
Yes. But would I like to make a new vlog channel? No. Also, I don't need your permission to make a

363
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,920
YouTube channel, Claire. I can do that whenever I want. Between these two options, you are literally

364
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,240
offering me a channel with 500,000 subscribers and a channel with none, neither of which have

365
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,600
my videos, which is the only thing I wanted. They explained that the reason option two even exists

366
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,360
is because they are rolling me protecting it in case something bad happened.

367
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:32,080
Were you were you not protecting the first one? Apparently, that is a superpower they have. You

368
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,760
just need to know really far in advance before they hack it so they can, like, put you on an

369
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,920
elite list and be like, don't hack them. They're my friends. Also, it's not even that. I think she

370
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,200
just said that. Like, there's literally nothing she could do to prevent my channel from being hacked.

371
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,640
I don't think they care. Now, for many people at this point, I'm sure you're thinking that

372
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,760
there must be some degree in which YouTube keeps archives of the videos themselves in case of this

373
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,640
sort of eventuality. Well, it seems they do, but the YouTube representatives claim that they can

374
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,600
only keep archives of creator videos for 30 days following their deletion. However, Meghan then

375
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:06,400
appears to disprove that as well. Meghan- Even when I think I must have asked three separate times,

376
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,440
what is the average amount of time it takes for a channel to be back through hacking? They couldn't

377
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,280
respond when they finally said, which is a totally legitimate and fine answer. If you didn't tell me

378
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,200
before that there is a set in stone 30-day time limit in which the time of the videos are fully

379
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,720
deleted and not recoverable from YouTube anymore. How can it vary? It varies from, what, one week to

380
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:34,320
four and a half weeks? Regardless, if you didn't figure it out in 30 days, that's on you. That is

381
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,960
your fault. A lot of stuff in here, AdSense, things like that, but what I'm going to focus on is that

382
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,560
30-day rule of data retention. She says, and I quote, regarding your question about data retention-

383
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,000
She didn't thank me for asking this question. Regarding your question about data retention,

384
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,480
as we mentioned during our call, we have data retention policies that this is a link to the

385
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,680
Google data retention policy. I then click on the link of the data retention policies, assuming that

386
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,320
it's going to verify in detail everything that they said to me on the call and this email.

387
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:08,320
Specifically, the 30-day data retention policy that Claire and Walter keep referencing as literal

388
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,160
fact. I assume this link is going to verify everything they've been telling me, and I am

389
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,360
only a few sentences in before I realize that everything they've been saying is not true.

390
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:22,400
According to this article, there is absolutely a chance that I should be able to get my videos back.

391
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,160
Something that has never been a part of option one or two. Not once in the document does it ever say

392
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,840
there is a set in stone, forever and always, 30-day policy in which videos will be deleted.

393
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:40,000
30 days is not mentioned once. For being mentioned so many times on the phone call and the emails,

394
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,920
it is not mentioned once on Google's official page of their data retention policy. To this day,

395
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,640
I have never seen 30 days in writing other than these emails. Furthermore,

396
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,920
inserting an exact quote from the policy they sent me, our services also use encrypted backup storage

397
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,160
as another layer of protection to help recover from potential disasters. Data can remain on

398
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,640
these systems for up to six months. This process generally takes around two months from the time

399
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:10,000
of deletion. I say the videos were not deleted two months ago. If it takes two months for the

400
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,080
videos to be fully deleted, why wouldn't any of the videos be left? Did you halt the two-month

401
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:19,360
deleting process? When? This often includes up to a month-long recovery period in case the data was

402
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:25,520
removed unintentionally. To which I specify the wording here is often, not always, or not standard

403
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,760
policy. There is no mention of a hard binding 30-day limit. I then send a link to a video that

404
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,520
Lilly had sent me earlier about someone whose channel was hacked and they got all of their

405
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,320
videos back. The description of this guy's video literally says that someone on the inside of

406
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:46,160
YouTube was able to get his videos back and it took a miracle. I say why wasn't this my experience?

407
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,280
And with this, some glaring issues begin to become apparent.

408
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,920
Why did it take so long for my channel to be investigated only to be resulted in no hijacking?

409
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,480
Why did YouTube just now tell me that the 30-day time limit, when this is such pertinent information

410
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,240
if I'm frantically trying to recover my YouTube videos, and that has always been my number one

411
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,240
priority, is to recover my YouTube videos? If investigating faster would have improved the

412
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,200
chances of retaining my entire library of content, why did no one intervene sooner? And why is it not

413
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:19,600
public knowledge? There are multiple pitfalls in YouTube's reaction and response to this situation,

414
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:25,760
however, it boils down to one key problem. That being, simply put, YouTube relies on templates,

415
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,880
for situations that cannot merely rely on templates.

416
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,840
At any time that I express my frustration and ask a question, the response I would get is

417
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,160
I'm so happy that you could express your feelings. Thank you for sharing that with us.

418
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,560
A fair proportion of Megan's second video highlights YouTube attempting, and mostly

419
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,520
failing, to cover for their egregious oversight through vague, evasive language, which provides

420
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,560
no information for how on earth, when originally investigating, they found no signs of suspicious

421
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:23,680
activity. In my opinion, this was because their internal team were using a template which had a

422
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,640
set of prerequisites to identify what suspicious activity would constitute as, and what occurred

423
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,440
on Megan's second channel was not picked up, because they didn't know who Megan was. If the

424
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,160
crew over at YouTube had even attempted to branch out into basic logic, then they would have

425
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,880
identified the problem quickly and dealt with it. The internet is one of the fastest evolving

426
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,920
environments, and too often, YouTube has shown that they cannot keep up. To add to this, the

427
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,560
YouTube Creator support team used templates when in contact with Megan, which led to the rather

428
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,200
insulting errors, and what Megan read into as gaslighting. This then inevitably followed through

429
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,440
to the more advanced team members she came into correspondence with, because they clearly didn't

430
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,280
know everything which had been said to her previously, and thus didn't know how to respond

431
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,000
to Megan's comments, which were loaded with her previous experiences. YouTube likes to have a

432
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,160
singular narrative which is based on what they know. The problem is that there are just so many

433
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,800
people at YouTube who hold different pieces of information to deal with such problems, and the

434
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,360
fact that this has been happening for so long, and it took a large creator to bring attention to it,

435
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,640
is unbelievable, yet unsurprising.

436
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:34,000
I am so tired, and I'm so exhausted with dealing with all of this stuff, and it's been such a toll

437
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:41,040
on my mental health, especially like... I have to be okay with the fact that I lost my vlog. Like, I

438
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,800
have to be okay with it, because I need to move on. If I just try and find all these other, like,

439
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,120
loopholes and things like that, like, it's exhausting. Like, I need to start the process of

440
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,600
getting over it and being okay.

441
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:58,640
In a final video on the situation, Megan states that YouTube has since taken responsibility and

442
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,920
apologised for the fiasco, while committing to some serious changes, changes that will be welcome,

443
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,560
but they still don't really acknowledge the amplitude of the problem. Hacking isn't a problem

444
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:13,600
that's going to disappear overnight. This problem is going to persist as long as there continues to

445
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:18,160
be people looking to purchase channels with greater financial potential than those which are

446
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,040
newly created, and as we've seen, people who are in the business of mass selling channels probably

447
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,520
didn't come into possession of them by asking nicely. Maybe YouTube has a better system of

448
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:32,480
identifying this when a person complains about it now, but in times like these, a lot of those voices

449
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,840
will not be heard. Additionally, Megan Rinks had a content manager, which is another benefit that

450
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:43,040
many individuals are not privy to. When I emailed them recently about an issue, they asked me to

451
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,360
name my content manager, and when I said I didn't have a content manager, and that it would be

452
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:52,320
really good to have one, the YouTube representative who I was talking to just straight up asked what

453
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:58,160
a content manager was. When I explained, he redirected me to the Content ID system, which was

454
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,440
not thrilling. So unfortunately, I cannot confirm that YouTube's creator support is improving on the

455
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,880
template front. YouTube need to get with it. There are too many layers, too much incoherence, and too

456
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,520
much impersonality when dealing with creators. As I have said, it's impossible to completely prevent

457
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,240
the hacking of channels when there are so many given YouTube size, but for too long it was treated

458
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,880
with inaction which has led to a lot of flaws being exposed. They have since been encouraging

459
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,200
two-factor authentication, which is definitely a step in the right direction, but I feel that for

460
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,680
many creators unfamiliar with the platform, the request will probably fall on deaf ears.

461
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:37,040
A lot of people just don't pay enough attention if it doesn't happen to them, particularly when

462
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:42,640
the channels are only being used as basic comment or like bots. Once again, in spite of the rules

463
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,200
against it, it's often hard to notice which channels are using it unless it's really transparent,

464
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,440
like with Logan, particularly with YouTube's policy which rounds up subscriber counts now.

465
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,000
There are companies that advertise their service, some of which boast that all their accounts are

466
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,920
organic and legit. How do you think they obtain those legit accounts? Hell, recently a large creator

467
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,560
by the name of Deji ended up in hot water after it was pretty seriously alleged that he spotted

468
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:13,120
his way to 10 million subscribers. The evidence was quite convincing, and his response left a bit to be desired.

469
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:20,000
You really think I'm that much of a moron? To bot subs? When my views aren't that high, it won't calibrate.

470
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:27,200
It just wouldn't work. It makes no sense. You guys must really think I'm dumb. My IQ level is

471
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:34,880
dumb high, alright? I'm not trying to brag. My IQ level is 189. That is a very high IQ, okay?

472
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:41,040
Without any real behind the scenes technical evidence, you couldn't prove anything to a degree

473
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,680
where his channel would face repercussions, particularly given his size. This actually could be

474
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:51,040
a topic for another time, so I'll leave that here. In Megan's third video, she explained how she

475
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,680
needed to speak to executive level people with serious clearance to even understand why she

476
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,560
couldn't recover her channels. Megan- And they couldn't tell me, Claire and Walter on the phone,

477
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,720
what day the vlogs had been deleted because they didn't have access, they didn't have that level

478
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,200
make it sound like the White House, but like that security clearance or access. And even the person

479
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,600
I talked to who was incredibly high up at YouTube, they had to go ask somebody who's really high up in

480
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:18,560
the tech spot to specifically go in and figure that out. And the day that my videos were deleted

481
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:23,280
was the day that my channel got hacked. Their video count uploader, that's not something that

482
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,480
updates regularly. It takes a little while before it reflects that, and that was the answer that I

483
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:34,800
was given as to why I didn't get my videos back because it had been more than 30 days. And those

484
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,120
loopholes that we had found in the 30 day process and all of that sort of stuff, they pointed out,

485
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:43,360
yeah, we're all valid and all really great arguments, but it doesn't change the fact

486
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:48,880
that those videos are gone. And they were like, if we had them, we would give them to you. That

487
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:56,000
is such a fantastic white horse, like knight in shining armor story of being able to really clear

488
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,520
our name and make us look a lot better. And there's no reason why we wouldn't give them

489
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:06,400
to you at this point. Like the videos have blown up, everybody's talking about them, it's caused

490
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,520
quite the fuss in the office, and there's no reason like we wouldn't just keep them from you

491
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:16,000
because it makes us look worse for the fact that we can't give them back. There's so much we don't

492
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,880
know, so much that YouTube doesn't want us to know, but it extends beyond that to things that

493
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:26,160
most YouTube staff employed to talk with the creators barely know about their own company,

494
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:30,400
and thus cannot deal with these problems effectively. YouTube always feels like it's

495
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,400
one step behind the issue. Well, multiple steps.

496
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,320
As much as I thought mine was terrible, I was getting people sending me screenshots of the

497
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:43,440
fact that their accounts had been dealing with all of this, and they got shut out, and no response for

498
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:50,320
two years. What? This is a failed system, and it's not working. And also through all of this,

499
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:55,360
I found it's not working for me, it's not working for so many creators who have much smaller channels,

500
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,800
but also still, it took Shane tweeting for them to care about me. Two million? Not enough.

501
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,280
When people first discovered Logan, it was pretty clear that suspicious activity was present,

502
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,640
and I can't really blame people for theorising about his nature, which clearly demonstrates some

503
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:13,520
proficiency, but to allege that he was taking control of channels which merely interacted with him

504
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,880
before using them to interact with his own channel was likely giving the guy a little too much credit.

505
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,360
However, at the same time, if it were a case more local to him, this explanation would be the end of

506
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:28,560
the issue, when really, it was just the start, one that revealed the underbelly of a crooked system,

507
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:33,920
and those who exploit it. But what can be done? Well, let's tie up this discussion.

508
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:45,040
Security online. For many creators, large and small, it's a priceless asset, and one that hopefully

509
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:50,880
we can do a better job of protecting from here on out. I focused on specific examples today,

510
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,840
but so many people have lost their channels unnecessarily, even people who I know,

511
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:00,480
and those who did manage to recover them often had to go through excessively stressful scenarios

512
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,960
which incurred great cost. In my opinion, regardless of the tricks they've pulled,

513
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,440
people like Logan are just the tail end of the snake, and until we aim for the head,

514
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:15,760
we will see a repeat of these sorts of situations. I've already spoken a bit about what YouTube can do,

515
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,160
but it's down to them as to how they want to implement prevention measures effectively,

516
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:25,600
and how much they want their teams to be in the know. YouTube has set policy and structure which

517
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:30,320
is primed to provide benefit to those who take advantage of it, whether that's merely botting,

518
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:34,800
or forcefully seizing channels with intrinsic value. Their teams need to have a better grip

519
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:40,000
on these perils, and how to identify the patterns they take, while disseminating necessary warnings

520
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,360
to creators when these patterns arise. In these circumstances, everyone does better by knowing

521
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:50,560
a little more. As for the sites, it's hard to really do anything else than make sure the people

522
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:55,440
who you rate aren't having their channel sold off without their knowledge, and if you see someone

523
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,920
you know, ask them if they're the owner of the listing. However, we're not going to be on these

524
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,960
sites all the time, in fact, I'm sure most of us have no intention to go anywhere near these sites.

525
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:10,240
The truth is, a lot of smaller channels will never be noticed, and I'd recommend a better verification

526
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:15,280
system for these sites to utilise if they do truly care about this stuff, which they may not,

527
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:21,280
so I won't hold my breath. So, what's the final piece of this puzzle? Well, I guess it's where you

528
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,840
guys come in, the crater. At the end of the day, these are your accounts, and although it's impossible

529
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:30,640
to guarantee a fully secure account, there are definitely ways to protect it that are worth noting.

530
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:35,520
With that in mind, I think it's time for a feature. When I was a small creator on the platform, there

531
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:40,240
were a few people within the community who I looked up to. Most of these people have either

532
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:45,040
garnered popularity, or left the site without a trace. My guest today is someone who had done the

533
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:50,720
latter for a long time, but recently returned, dropping me a line, and I thought, you know what,

534
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,520
you guys might like to meet him. So, ladies and gentlemen, talking about security vulnerability

535
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:00,240
online, and how to prevent it, I present to you, my good friend, Mugcup.

536
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:07,200
Vulnerability online. It's a more prevalent issue now than ever, with classes over platforms like

537
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:12,560
Zoom regularly having their vulnerability tested and pushed, often past their limits.

538
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,880
So, what's the solution here? YouTubers should just pick longer passwords, right?

539
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:23,520
No. I mean, yes, you should have a long password, but no, that's not why most instances of YouTube

540
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:28,720
channel theft occur. The fact of the matter is, Google is a ridiculously secure company,

541
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:33,200
in the grand scheme of things, which is to say that it takes quite a bit of doing to get into

542
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,360
an account that isn't yours. Brute forcing your way through a password check will just get you to

543
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:42,560
an IP check, and yada yada. Point being, there's a lot of hoops to jump through, and some of those

544
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:48,080
hoops are quite small, you know, because they're like, hard to jump through. You get it. Anyway,

545
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:52,560
so how do YouTube channels get stolen? Well, oftentimes, it's through a process called social

546
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:58,560
engineering, or SE-ing for short. SE-ing is pretty much just getting people to do stuff for you,

547
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:03,280
altering another person's actions with your own social stimulus in the pursuit of a favorable

548
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:09,360
outcome. To try to use this tactic in person, in my opinion, is just neckbeardy bullshit. I know

549
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:13,760
there are some studies about mirroring and its effect on openness, but I am of the firm belief

550
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:18,400
that in any in-person social interaction, you will have infinitely more success being yourself

551
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:26,320
than by playing the game. However, online, because the social stimulus we receive is so vague,

552
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:30,320
generally occurring through text, we are much more vulnerable to social engineering. And yes,

553
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:34,480
I understand that this sounds completely counterintuitive, being more vulnerable on the

554
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,600
internet. You would think you would have your guard up all the more, but it's important to

555
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:42,960
remember that when you're navigating the internet, your goal is not always to keep yourself safe from

556
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,720
information phishing. It's usually either to work or to entertain yourself. And when you're on

557
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:53,600
YouTube as a small creator, not only is your primary goal not to keep yourself safe from

558
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:58,400
phishing attacks, keeping yourself safe is actually downgraded to at least your tertiary

559
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:03,680
goal with your primary being entertainment and your secondary being success. So we've proven

560
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:08,560
that SE-ing is effective, even though it feels like only an idiot would fall for it. But how does

561
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:13,920
it actually happen? We touched on this a little before, but on YouTube, given that a password isn't

562
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:19,040
enough to steal an account, hackers are going to need a little bit more, making their social

563
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:25,360
engineering attacks go a little bit deeper. While you'll occasionally spot a fake YouTube link,

564
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:30,560
or merch store link, or another weird tailgating attempt from a misspelled PewDiePie,

565
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:35,280
generally the kinds of social engineering schemes that put small creators in the face of danger

566
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:42,240
have a little more nuance. Let's say a guy emails you. He says, hey, this is Chet from YouTube.

567
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,560
I tried to log into your account to fix some issues on our backend, but due to your settings,

568
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:51,680
I need you to approve my entry into your account. Don't worry, I'm just updating some things. Like

569
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:57,440
all other Chets, this Chet is a liar. He's not with YouTube. And he's gearing up to get his

570
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,640
buttery little hands all over your YouTube channel, either to sell it or to add it to

571
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:08,000
his collection of YouTube channels that he can alluringly spam people with and start the cycle

572
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:18,000
anew with another poor soul. So basically, if you're a small creator, just don't let your

573
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,000
excitement lead to your demise. As a small creator on YouTube, the most exciting things are also

574
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,960
mixed with the most danger. Case in point, sponsorships. They are the best way to make

575
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:34,400
money on this site these days, but they also come with the most risk, even ignoring all the possible

576
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:39,280
monetary scamming that can occur in these situations. The risk of malware is surprisingly

577
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:44,240
high as fake companies like PollBoost and Nexi will attempt to infect YouTubers computers with

578
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:50,240
remote administration tools or RATS for short. RATS allow the administrator or in this instance,

579
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:54,320
the hacker, scammer, whatever you want to call them, to view all your saved passwords,

580
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:59,040
record your keystrokes, view your webcam, listen to your microphone, speak through your headphones.

581
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:04,880
Any nook and cranny of your privacy essentially can be rifled through by some random guy because

582
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,600
you downloaded and opened a program hoping to make some money. So of course, from there,

583
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:15,440
the next logical question is, so how do we avoid that? I know it's scary to risk losing

584
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,360
a potential sponsor, but you have to do your research. And if something seems suspicious,

585
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:23,360
you owe it to yourself to take that impulse seriously. Look for the little things,

586
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:28,640
the gaps in professionalism that a legitimate company would never dare show. Advertisers

587
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:33,600
admitting they aren't good at their jobs but will make up for it monetarily is a dead giveaway,

588
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:40,080
and a pretty common one too, as what employee on any actual company email would ever write that?

589
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:45,760
And yet we can see this on proud display in the case of Tech it Easy, a man contacted by

590
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:51,040
a company named Oreo Cleaner Oreo Cleaner. Either way, it doesn't matter. I'm going to spoil it.

591
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,840
It's another made up company. And yet again, we see this company representative openly admitting

592
00:54:55,840 --> 00:55:01,920
that he's not very good at his job, attempting to explain away his own lack of professionalism,

593
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,400
and once again, ensuring that his rat will be downloaded to the victim's hard drive by

594
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:12,320
promising a monetary reward in exchange for a review, a process that requires at the very least

595
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:18,080
a brief look at the software, more than enough time for a rat to take root and steal the data

596
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:23,440
of the content creator in question. Another important point, your phone can get viruses

597
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,760
and has a high probability of doing so if you randomly download every app that any rando

598
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:33,840
pretending to be a company sends you. Point being, stay vigilant and follow your instincts. You are

599
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:39,680
not selfish, nor are you stupid for wanting to work with reputable people. A lot of scams will

600
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:45,120
also try to scare you into stupidity by giving you a time limit to take action and avoid a

601
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:50,800
negative result like the loss of your channel or in the case of sponsorships, a loss of income.

602
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:56,480
Even our very own the right opinion had two particularly clever attempts at his channel made

603
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:02,080
with a scammer using a throwaway email with an altered name to make themselves appear to be a

604
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:08,640
YouTube employee in both scams. In the first scam, the right opinion was directed to a phishing link

605
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:14,240
disguised as an altered terms of service with his channel being threatened with deletion. While in

606
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:19,440
the second scam, he was accused of uploading harmful and violent content and it was declared

607
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:25,600
that his channel had a strike. And once again, he was directed to a phishing link, but this time it

608
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:31,280
was disguised as an appeal form. Once again, we see a trend in both of these strategies as they

609
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:36,800
both attempt to induce panic in order to compromise your judgment. But with all scams like these,

610
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:42,560
it's important to remember that YouTube isn't just going to email you about anything significant

611
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:48,160
that happens to your channel. It'll also show up in your YouTube studio or in the case of a terms

612
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:53,680
of service change, it'll likely appear on your homepage. So rather than following any risky links,

613
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:58,080
just type youtube.com into your browser and you will get a version of the site that will not

614
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:03,840
steal your data. Scammers prey on the parts of us that aren't reasonable or rational and loss

615
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:10,960
aversion, the cognitive distortion of value that it is, is certainly neither of those things and is

616
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:16,400
thus often exploited by scammers. In addition to everything we've talked about so far due to how

617
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:21,360
little is known about the wannabe friends comment, a lot of people are suspecting that channels like

618
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:27,280
Logan are using an exploit in the OAuth token system in order to gain people's account permissions

619
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:32,960
without needing to obtain their details. So every time you allow an app to manage your YouTube

620
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:38,080
channel like TubeBuddy or vidIQ, people are currently theorizing that there is an issue

621
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:42,720
with that system. I'm not trying to fear monger, I'm just trying to make you as aware as possible

622
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:48,160
because not a lot is known about this particular scam. So long story short, be wary of any app that

623
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:53,120
you provide with permissions to your account right now as it's being theorized that that system is

624
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:59,600
compromised or compromisable, but who knows for sure. Maybe a hacker, but hopefully not. So to

625
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:05,120
sum it all up, if someone sends you a link, even if it's a slightly misspelled Team YouTube,

626
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:08,720
it's not probably fine. And if you get a sponsorship deal, but it's for a company that

627
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:13,280
you can't find on the internet, or when you do find them, it looks very suspicious, probably

628
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,280
avoid that too. And we can definitely get super niche and specific here. But for the sake of not

629
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:21,760
overwhelming you with little things to do on the internet, I'll just condense what I'm saying into

630
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:27,760
a single sentence. Look around before you type in your information. Make sure that the Google login

631
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:32,240
page you're about to use looks like a Google login page, and listen to your antivirus or your

632
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,560
browser when it tries to point you in the other direction.

633
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:41,920
Thank you, Mugcup. Thank you for being such a top lad. I hope we all see you around soon, and I hope

634
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,080
you imparted the viewers with a little wisdom. I'll be leaving a link in the pinned comment if you

635
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:51,280
guys really did. At the start of this video, we were presented with a problem, one which led to

636
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:56,640
certain interpretations which seemed quite serious, but also slightly reductionist and presumptuous.

637
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:01,840
People identified Logan's antics as the problem rather than the symptom. Although it may well be

638
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:07,120
a problem in itself, it's always good to ask a few questions about how someone could play the system

639
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:12,560
in the way that Logan has. All over YouTube, there is an abundance of boilerplate content set up on

640
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:17,680
the foundations of other channels, aiming to acquire the bag through strong clip baiting content

641
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:22,720
that people won't think twice about. What Logan's, or whichever name they go by at this point,

642
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:28,000
intentions are is unclear, but they seem to be a mere cog in a greater system.

643
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,520
Behind the scenes, there are people working round the clock to ring out channels from

644
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:36,800
unsuspecting small and medium-sized creators, those who may not be too familiar with the trickery

645
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:41,600
operated by these fiends. When these people notice, it's often after they've lost access to their

646
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:46,720
account and respective emails, and their means of finding help is limited. YouTube's response has

647
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:51,040
often been lackluster, typically relying on a rudimentary checklist which has occasionally

648
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:55,600
failed to diagnose the problem altogether, even when it appears flagrantly obvious.

649
00:59:55,600 --> 01:00:00,160
This was revealed most sensationally in Megan Rink's video, but can be attested in the

650
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,560
rants of many other frustrated creators.

651
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:08,640
The main thing that pissed me off the most was losing my true channel. I went fucking insane in like

652
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:15,200
the last coffee in six weeks, not gonna lie. Insane as in, I had no control over my emotions anymore.

653
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:23,040
And they got pressed. That's basically what happened. Depressed to the point where I could relate

654
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:27,040
myself to a 14-year-old fucking me who had suicidal problems.

655
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:32,080
Given YouTube is about as transparent as they ever are, it's hard to know whether they've truly

656
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:36,720
ameliorated people's concerns, but I hope they are at least a bit more conscious of the matters

657
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,040
highlighted in this video, and others.

658
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:45,040
And Google and YouTube support were just taking me in circles, telling me to do the same thing over and over again.

659
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:53,040
Completely useless, like, completely useless. So finally, on the tenth day, ten days, the account recovery

660
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:59,040
comes through, and I get my account back. So, thank you Google, even though you didn't really help that much.

661
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:04,960
Well, that's faster than before. Nonetheless, it's best not to rely on corporations to look out for you,

662
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,800
it doesn't always end too well.

663
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:11,760
Take all necessary precautions to safeguard your account from malicious actors, and be sure not to fall

664
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:16,880
for any of the machinations which may seem credible to the untrained eye. If you do this, not only do you

665
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:21,920
protect your own account, but you allow YouTube to perhaps dedicate more time to those who have fallen victim.

666
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:26,720
Emphasis on the perhaps, I shan't speak too unequivocally on their priorities.

667
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:32,080
The internet is an evolving place with evolving problems, and we need to evolve with it.

668
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:37,680
It's strange how a simple question from an appearingly unexceptional account can cause so much concern

669
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:43,520
in a community. That concern is justified, but sometimes misplaced. Sometimes the truth is a little less

670
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:50,000
far-fetched, and a little more, well, preventable. So, how secure is your account online?

671
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:55,760
Well, that's down to you. All I'll say is, don't find out the hard way. Before you know it, your account might be

672
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:01,840
transformed into a comment bot, or even worse, a half-assed top 10 compilation channel.

673
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:04,400
That is no way for a man to meet his fate.

674
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:30,960
That's enough, I need to thank my Patrons, the $10 Patrons are up on screen right now, thank you guys for your

675
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:37,600
support and contribution, I really appreciate it, but also the $50 Patrons, Somehuller Blue, Caroline,

676
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:45,440
Hypercube, Amanda, Devon, Shirochigo, Vertex Avenger, and Doug Nolan, with extra special thanks to my $100

677
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:51,680
Patrons, Christopher Karras, and Ileana Banana, what a charming name, thank you so much for your support,

678
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:58,800
it really means a hell of a lot, you guys are top-notch, top-notch people, keep it up, thank you for your

679
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:05,840
continued support. Anyhow, I don't have too much else to add, if you wanna find me on my social medias,

680
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:11,680
they'll be in the pinned comment Discord, Twitter, I'm not using Facebook right now, but you can still follow

681
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:16,480
if you want. Anyhow, I don't have too much else to say, but I hope you guys take care of yourself,

682
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:21,200
and I'm The Right Opinion, I'll see you in the next one.
