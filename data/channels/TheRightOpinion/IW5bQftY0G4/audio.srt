1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,880
Hey guys, y'all know your address is online right?

2
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,880
Huh?

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,200
I just looked it up.

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,240
And why did you do that?

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,300
Haha yeah, so if you're in the US there are these sites where you can literally just find

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,180
people's information.

7
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,100
We aren't even in the US.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,500
Haha yeah, we are now.

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,440
So you popped up to tell us our address is out there and that there is nothing we can

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,440
do about it.

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,660
You can do something about it.

12
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,160
It just comes at a price.

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,180
A fairly reasonable one actually.

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,200
It's called Incognite, the sponsor of today's video.

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,500
Has this ever happened to you?

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,680
It's Friday night, you're sitting at home alone as always.

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,800
It's been three weeks since you've had contact with another human being.

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,080
A miracle happens.

19
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,300
Your phone is ringing.

20
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,560
It's a random number.

21
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,200
This is the most excitement you've had in months.

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,200
You pick it up.

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Hello?

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
John speaking, you say.

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
A voice answers back.

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
Hello, we've been trying to reach you about your car's extended warranty.

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
It's a remote call again.

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,560
How do they keep getting my number I hear you ask?

29
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,920
Companies known as data brokers collect your information and sell it onto whoever will

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,960
pay.

31
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,400
There are hundreds of data brokers making it difficult to fight them on your own.

32
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,480
Incognite will automatically contact them on your behalf to issue takedown requests

33
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,480
for your data so you don't have to.

34
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,920
If we subscribe to Incognite, will you leave?

35
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,920
Yeah.

36
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,920
Okay, great.

37
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,580
Um, Harley, can you go get my wallet?

38
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,640

So be sure to check it out.

41
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:03,140
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

42
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,140
too much free time.

43
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,540
And last video I covered the bombastic yet short lived YouTube collective of Team 10.

44
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:21,700
If you want more on that video, you can go and watch it.

45
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,620
But ultimately their undoing was the lack of permanence they could find within their

46
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,300
members, which was exacerbated by an immature leader who drove people away, sacrificed his

47
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,820
business credibility, and served as a magnet for all sorts of drama.

48
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,740
Team 10 is an example of something that seemed bound to fall apart at any moment, he managed

49
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,260
to leave an imprint on the YouTube landscape all the same, a pair of handprints in the

50
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,580
cement before it set.

51
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,980
However, Jake Paul's Omnium Gather'em isn't the only YouTube ensemble over the

52
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,340
years to disband, as a matter of fact many more successful and long-running groups have

53
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:59,340
found themselves at the end of their lifespan for a plethora of reasons.

54
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,200
I'd say one of the most common reasons being that in many circumstances, the average age

55
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,420
of many creators on YouTube skews towards a much younger mean, and if you're under

56
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,660
the age of 25 or even 30, you're going to go through significant changes as an individual

57
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,440
who wants to find their purpose in life.

58
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,140
As a creator, you can evolve on your own terms, but when you have a designated role in a group,

59
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,220
the expectations imposed on you can be suffocating, and may well test your commitment to people

60
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,740
who do not necessarily share the same dreams that you do.

61
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,420
Being part of a group can often really limit your development as an individual, and may

62
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,540
also not give you the sort of compensation that you feel is appropriate for someone of

63
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,620
your ability, you want to go out into the world and fulfil your potential before you

64
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,620
settle down.

65
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,460
When people grow, they can often grow apart, however not every group feels an expectation

66
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:44,680
for eternal development, especially outside of YouTube.

67
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,860
This is Buzzfeed, an internet media website founded in 2016 with the goal of arbitrating

68
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,400
and disseminating online news through the use of algorithms.

69
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,040
Over the years, they expanded their project and began to hire personnel to actually publish

70
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,400
stories and add a face to their public image.

71
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,480
Buzzfeed has received a lot of criticism in its time, and it's become a bit of a sacrificial

72
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,280
lamb for the lampooning of millennial-based news, and it's purported vapidity.

73
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,200
Nonetheless, it also became extremely successful, and blossomed as social media platforms took

74
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,960
a grasp on internet climate, particularly on YouTube where algorithmic-based marketing

75
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,360
was king, and multiple channels were set up under the Buzzfeed name to reach as many

76
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,000
target demographics as possible.

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,740
In spite of Buzzfeed's success, YouTube also brought many new challenges regarding

78
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:25,080
creator-audience relationships, many of which felt like they had to be rooted in some form

79
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,360
of personality, and although Buzzfeed's topics drew viewers and platformed individuals,

80
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,340
their attention likely struggled while they tried to find a way to bridge the gap between

81
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,080
themselves and the average YouTube viewer.

82
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,200
Amongst this quandary, four unlikely heroes appeared, by the names of Eugene Lee Yang,

83
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,880
Ned Fulmer, Keith Habersberger, and Zach Kornfeld.

84
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,720
They were all Buzzfeed employees at the time who, as the only male employees prepared to,

85
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,920
decided to create a video where they tried ladies' underwear.

86
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,280
The result was somewhat unsurprising, but nonetheless interesting for people who wished

87
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,760
to observe such a scenario, and men trying it.

88
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,920
Buzzfeed had previously been experimenting with content that featured individuals trying

89
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,240
a new experience, but this one was the first one to really stick the landing.

90
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,200
There's no way for me to wear these without something popping out.

91
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,840
Maybe if I tuck it up.

92
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,840
This is why girls are always picking it out of things.

93
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,840
As individuals, the Try Guys weren't your typical YouTube assemblage.

94
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,360
They didn't start a channel together, nor were they previously overwhelmingly successful

95
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,360
online.

96
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,360
In fact, they didn't even intend to create content as a dedicated group when they started,

97
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,760
with their only other prominent credits being other content on their employer's channel.

98
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,720
But their video was well received, and in the spirit of Buzzfeed, they decided to get

99
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,000
to work to creating more content in that vein.

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,840
It wasn't until a few videos in which they actually adopted the Try Guys branding that

101
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,580
they are known for today, alongside a mantra that they were prepared to try anything and

102
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,580
everything.

103
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,660
I think with everything that we do, we try to show that there is no one right way to

104
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,700
be a man, to be a person, and yeah, you can still be tiny and delicate and cute and still

105
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,700
be awesome.

106
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,300
Given the unlikely story behind their formation, it seemed even more unlikely that this quartet

107
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,180
would be able to survive each other, let alone the ever-changing environment around them.

108
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,340
And yet over the years, they not only survived, but moved from strength to strength, growing

109
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,980
a significant fanbase, winning multiple awards, publishing a best-selling book, acquiring

110
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,700
their own YouTube Red series, and launching countless spin-offs.

111
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,100
With the audience established, and their image untarnished, the only significant breakup

112
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,340
occurred being their collective departure from Buzzfeed to launch their own independent

113
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,780
production company, Second Try LLC, in which they have hosted their main, and a variety

114
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,780
of other series out of.

115
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,980
The decision to go solo together also lended a lot more creative freedom for each of the

116
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,660
members to express themselves, the most notable example of this being Eugene's coming out

117
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,300
video that is amongst one of their channel's most viewed.

118
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,420
The Try Guys' apparent success as creators was rooted in that simple idea that they had

119
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,380
founded themselves on, it didn't seem particularly revolutionary, but is often underscored by

120
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,940
the timeless social message of finding out what it was like to walk in someone else's

121
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,940
shoes.

122
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,740
Their successes, colleagues, and friends, though, came down to something different.

123
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,980
As people who didn't expect at every attempt, as people who just wanted to try something,

124
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,460
there was this common bond that drew them together, using their YouTube channel to strengthen

125
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,740
their own friendships.

126
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,100
Although certain members may possess different levels of influence outside the group, when

127
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,340
the cameras rolled, you never received the impression that one member's ego outshone

128
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,340
the others.

129
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,860
However, come 2022, something would happen that would place the message promoted in their

130
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:05,340
interviews and their channel under question, and ultimately cause irreversible change to

131
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:10,020
one of the most seemingly consistent and omnipresent YouTube collectives in recent memory.

132
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,980
Maybe there were some things that shouldn't be tried.

133
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,760
Ned Fomer is no longer working with the Try Guys.

134
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:22,580
So friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears as we delve into the trial of the

135
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:37,940
Try Guys.

136
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,280
As I informed you in my introduction, the Try Guys were comprised of four members upon

137
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,460
its founding, and although none of them stood out from each other, the differences in their

138
00:07:44,460 --> 00:08:07,160
personalities were essential to the sore play that occurred on camera.

139
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,820
You add Zack, who is the energetic, slightly mischievous one, Keith who has a warmer, more

140
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,620
traditional child about him, and also enjoys some good fried chicken, and then you have

141
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,940
Eugene, who is more biting and sardonic but still possesses a unique amount of depth,

142
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:36,660
and then you have Ned, the straight shooting family man.

143
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,940
A chemistry graduate from Yale, Ned Fomer wouldn't strike you as your stereotypical

144
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,920
media savvy individual, but his extracurricular activity would soon give you an impression

145
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,140
of what he was capable of.

146
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:54,260
A decorated comedy writer and performer in his circuit, Fomer already had his fair share

147
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,980
of experience under his belt when he was picked up by Buzzfeed as an intern, and he quickly

148
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,460
used that expertise to ascend the ranks to managing producer in the space of a year,

149
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,260
alongside founding Buzzfeed's video department with his future fellow Try Guys co-hosts.

150
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,240
However, there was more to Ned than just his career in comedy, it seems that his degree

151
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,320
was not the only thing that he had chemistry with. Yes, even in early videos, there appeared

152
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:24,560
to be a ring on his finger, signifying that Ned Fomer was a married man.

153
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,880
His wife was a person by the birth name Aria Wundervord, she had met him at a mutual friend's

154
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,040
birthday partly shortly after they had moved to Chicago, and they soon fell head over heels

155
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,640
for each other. In 2012, at the age of 25, Ned officially tied the knot with Ariel, and

156
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,480
settled down to the married couple's life. Unlike a lot of online personalities, Ned

157
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,840
made no secret of his marriage, and would readily talk about his relationship on the

158
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,860
Try Guys channel, garnering the reputation of the family man, who would readily bend

159
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,960
over backwards for his lifelong companion.

160
00:09:50,960 --> 00:10:02,480
At first, the Try Guys content really only involved the four of them, with the establish

161
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,080
of their own production company and the progression of their personal lives of other members,

162
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,360
Aria and her partners found themselves more entangled in the crew's capers, especially

163
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,680
with the launch of the Tri-Wife series, which features herself, Zach's girlfriend Maggie,

164
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,880
and Keith's wife Becky.

165
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:36,020
However, the Tri-Wife wasn't the only person in Ned's life, and since being where

166
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:40,140
they had welcomed two children into the world. Once again, Ned was extremely proud to proclaim

167
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,560
this, with multiple posts on social media and uploads onto YouTube, even launching a

168
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,540
podcast with Ariel called Baby Steps, which discussed their experience with pregnancy

169
00:10:47,540 --> 00:11:10,300
and parenting. Ned often presented himself as a voice of authority on successful relationships

170
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,860
and how to navigate them, hence the podcast. This was particularly important in the Try

171
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,660
Guys post Buzzfeed era, which sought to find a sense of depth with each of the members.

172
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:22,060
That was Ned's depth, but he always put his family first, and possessed very few reservations

173
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,980
about it. His relationship with the Try Guys was also defined by this, and references to

174
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,700
his family and content was frequently and seemingly central to the tasks at hand. I

175
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,460
think what made Ned unique in a way was the sense of completion with his personal life,

176
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:37,260
it provided a metaphorical anchor to what the Try Guys were orchestrating. Every Try

177
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,820
Guy had something to try, but Ned had something to keep, and he appeared committed to doing

178
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,820
so.

179
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,280
In 2022, the Try Guys series had been in operation for nearly 8 years, and everything seemed

180
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,900
pretty settled. Sure, they weren't pulling the significant viewing numbers they did at

181
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,660
the peak of their popularity, but they seemed to understand that and already sought to diversify

182
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,420
their revenue streams, with everything from a clothing line to a chicken sauce. The Try

183
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,140
Guys appeared to have navigated the challenge of outgrowing each other by unshackling themselves

184
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,900
from any constraints, and having an equal power share with their new company. That was

185
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,480
a gesture of trust that could not be ignored. Outside of the new relationship they sought

186
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,920
to craft their audience, there was also a new business side to their operations, and

187
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,280
this incurred a new sense of responsibility on each of the members, who all hailed the

188
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,880
title of Executive Producer at Second Try LLC. They all own shared and recruited a full

189
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,880
team of employees, something that is never a straightforward process. Nevertheless, in

190
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,940
interviews, what claimed matter most of them was that they were in control of their careers

191
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,960
and their images, something that they were never able to completely fulfil while working

192
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,840
under Buzzfeed. They were the masters of their own destiny.

193
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,880
The thrill of being able to operate your own company and not having to answer to anyone

194
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,760
is pretty unmatched. It allowed each Try Guy to pursue their own personal and group interests

195
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,240
without the constraints of a parent company, or even a reliance on a singular platform.

196
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,840
At the same time, there are a lot of external pressures that being your own boss may impose

197
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,960
on you. The Try Guys had to navigate them, and required the input of all members to do

198
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,760
so, but for years running their own business and everything appeared to be going swimmingly,

199
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,080
until some keen observers began to spot the absence of one of their members.

200
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:07,080
Hands up, bakers! Nailed it! I'm f***ing crushed here, guys.

201
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,480
Where could our resident family man be?

202
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,440
The Try Guys have a pretty consistent upload schedule and motif in general, so devoted

203
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,280
fans were normally quite quick to pick up if something was different or something has

204
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,440
changed, particularly if a member is absent from the videos. When Eugene took a break

205
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,320
in 2021 from the Try Guys, people were fast to pick up on it, and explained it to other

206
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,680
confused viewers. So in September 2022, when a video was published onto the Try Guys channel

207
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,600
without founding member Ned Former, although nobody raised an alarm, people definitely

208
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,320
took notice, particularly with what some knew already.

209
00:13:48,320 --> 00:14:02,120
It all started on the first of the month, when a fan ran into Ned at New York City,

210
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,120
while he was with a producer at a concert. They posted a pitch with Ned, but not the

211
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,280
producer, and noted that they seemed annoyed that they were recognised. It was soon revealed

212
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,200
there were other people from the production team at the concert, and therefore nothing

213
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,040
seemed particularly out of the ordinary. However, less than a couple days after, other posts

214
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,720
appeared to indicate that something untoward was occurring, with images shared that showed

215
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,120
a person appearing to be Ned making out with this aforementioned producer. The account

216
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,340
sharing many of these details later claimed in the messages that they were the producers

217
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,160
then fiance. Certainly a curious piece of information to share, and it seemed a bit

218
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,240
bizarre that they would take to Reddit over it, but fans compared and included that physical

219
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,100
profiles matched up with the individuals suggested. With that noted, there was probably more concern

220
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,080
than usual when Ned ceased to appear on the Try Guys videos in their podcast. This was

221
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,680
clearly something unforeseen at least, although a variety of explanations were still on the

222
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,120
table, and it was possible that the Try Guys were merely taking precautionary measures

223
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,440
while investigating the claims more thoroughly. Although no public statements were released

224
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,480
in this time, the Try Guys schedule was visibly disrupted, with apologies being posted onto

225
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,160
their Patreon, with Zant letting slip that he wasn't doing so great in a podcast episode.

226
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:09,440
Zant- When I tell you that, I've had a rough week, and this has been such a salve.

227
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,800
This was all circumstantial and hearsay though, with a plethora of potential explanations

228
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,640
for why this was the case. Over time though, further information began to indicate that

229
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,520
this was something being taken a little more permanently. On the Try Guys channel, Ned

230
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,480
was being edited out of the intro featuring new merch, and some eagle eyed viewers began

231
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,280
to pick up on slight discrepancies in videos, including points where it appeared to have

232
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,760
been edited out of recorded footage. This didn't seem like the sort of decisions where

233
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,820
a person was merely on an optional hiatus, this appeared to be a preparation for something

234
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:41,540
much, much worse. And on September the 26th, the rumours that Ned Fulmer had boldly tried

235
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,540
an affair with a co-worker while in a committed marriage began to make the rounds outside

236
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,780
of dedicated fan circles, with more people weighing in online and analysing the content

237
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:54,500
available. In addition, a former Second Try employee who had recently left posted a TikTok

238
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,140
that appeared to confirm the rumours.

239
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:02,420
Zant- You ruined everything, you stupid bitch.

240
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,260
At this stage, nothing had been certified by the party, but everything appeared to be

241
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:10,140
adding up regarding his sudden airbrushing from the Try Guys content, and apprehending

242
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:14,280
that the news was about to break, on the 27th of September, the Try Guys released a short

243
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,140
statement on social media informing all that an internal review had been conducted and

244
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,620
that Ned had been removed from the Try Guys roster, as they did not see a way forward

245
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:25,140
with him. The same day, Ned released a statement onto Twitter and Instagram which confirmed

246
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,560
the rumours regarding the reason behind this. He states that family should have been his

247
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,340
priority but he ultimately lost focus and partook in a consensual, I'd hope so, workplace

248
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:37,260
relationship. He apologises for any pain that he has caused to everyone affected, especially

249
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,900
Ariel who he pledges commitment following the scandal. This statement in particular

250
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,780
was not well received, and many people proceeded to dunk on him, even starting a meme trend

251
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:48,820
where Ned's selectively used letters from his statement to create a new comment or message,

252
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,380
so at least something creative came out of it. It is a bit of a strange statement, every

253
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,540
word seems rather contrived, and although I'm sure people are pleased that it was

254
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,580
a consensual relationship, I don't think they were assuming otherwise, so Ned's phrasing

255
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,420
seems strangely defensive in light of that.

256
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,500
Ariel also released a statement onto Instagram thanking those who had reached out to her

257
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,900
but requesting privacy for the sake of her children, emphasizing that nothing was more

258
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,900
important to the couple. In the space of a day, all directly involved parties with a

259
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,660
public presence had released their own statements, amplifying the story significantly, and on

260
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,740
hand to further share the story was the ever reliable media.

261
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,500
If you're on any form of social media, then by now you must have heard of the huge scandal

262
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,940
involving Ned from the Try Guys.

263
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,180
Over the following week, a series of articles were published which reflected on the sudden

264
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:32,540
revelations and people's responses to it, including ironically from Buzzfeed themselves.

265
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,740
Some former co-workers appeared to react with indifference, implying that this news was

266
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:40,780
not exactly surprising to them. As expected, analysis of past content began as well, including

267
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:44,360
an interview where Ned states that if he was ever cheated on he'd probably moved to Canada,

268
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,540
and that it was the ultimate deal breaker in a relationship, alongside other claims

269
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,260
he had made advances elsewhere. Questions were asked about how long this had gone on

270
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:55,020
for, whether there were more people, with the sorts of reactions coming from any sources,

271
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,460
this sort of hypothesis was rife amongst internet communities. It was clearly blowing

272
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,700
up faster than anticipated, and questions were beginning to circulate regarding the

273
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,220
Try Guys' own knowledge of the matter, and their potential complicity in a cover-up

274
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,740
of this workplace affair. Such behaviour would be counter-intuitive to what their brand exemplified

275
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,500
and could seriously affect their operations. By this point, the Try Guys had to disclose

276
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,420
too much information outside of their statements, and people didn't necessarily have a right

277
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:21,820
to speculate, but that's what people on the internet do, and without further information

278
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,140
such theories were going to continue to churn away.

279
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,980
Ned Fomer is no longer working with the Try Guys. By now, we're assuming you've seen

280
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:34,460
the Reddit threads, and TikToks, and tweets, and news articles.

281
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,060
They needed to clear the air.

282
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:45,460
On October 3rd, the Try Guys released a video entitled What Happened? As one can likely

283
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,680
predict, this is a video which attempts to clarify information that have been speculated

284
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:53,660
about on a variety of media platforms by providing a linear chronological timeline of their handling

285
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,340
of the suspension of their former colleague. The video has them sitting on a couch, directly

286
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,020
facing the camera, and the information is delivered in a uniform manner, with each of

287
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,660
the Try Guys taking turns to explain parts of the process, likely to emphasise that this

288
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,060
was a collective decision.

289
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:11,380
Throughout this video, there will be things that we want to say or go into further, but

290
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,560
as I'm sure you're aware, there are some legal issues we have to consider as we go

291
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,080
through everything.

292
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,360
They state that they had been alerted to this information on Labor Day by fans who had seen

293
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,740
Ned Forman engaging romantically with an employee of the company, and had confirmed

294
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,920
these allegations and conceded that it had been going on for a while, which the Try Guys

295
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,280
found rather surprising, affirming that they had no idea about this effect.

296
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,440
All of that information was just as shocking to us as all of this has been for you this

297
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,440
week.

298
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,480
After this, they conducted a thorough three week internal review which would seek to ascertain

299
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,160
all the facts of the situation, once again with Eugene stressing how serious the situation

300
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,980
was to the rest of his team, and rebusting rumours that they may have turned a blind

301
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,740
eye at any point.

302
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:52,060
This is something we took very seriously.

303
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,460
We refused to sweep things under the rug.

304
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,140
That is not who we are, and it's not what we stand for.

305
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,860
They state their process was not just internal, as they reassessed the media they released

306
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,260
in that time, confirming rumours that they had been digitally removing Ned from their

307
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,780
content, and omitting sections which involved him altogether, as well as stating there were

308
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,020
certain videos that were too tainted for release.

309
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,660
There are several videos that we've deemed as fully unreleasable, you will never see

310
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,940
them, and that is due to his involvement, and that's a decision that has cost us lots

311
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,940
of money.

312
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,180
We will not be able to recoup that money, but it's a decision we stand by proudly.

313
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,380
The review drew to a close with the conclusion that the only reasonable solution in this

314
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,500
case was to ultimately remove Ned from the company as a manager and employee, something

315
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,820
which the three remaining members did on September 16th, just over ten days before the story

316
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,000
broke publicly.

317
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,220
They arrived reasoning for not releasing a public statement immediately, wishing to protect

318
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:46,100
the privacy of people involved, and avoiding causing additional stress onto affected parties.

319
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:51,460
So on Friday, September 16th, the three of us signed written consent of the members of

320
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:57,740
Second Try LLC approving the removal of Ned as a manager and employee, and while we consider

321
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:03,420
this a company matter, there's just also a family at the centre of this.

322
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,900
They then talk about the actual personal toll it's taken on them, and those around them,

323
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,140
requesting respect and space for any people caught up in the blast radius of such a spectacle.

324
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:17,140
Look, I get that when stuff like this happens, there's going to be speculation and gossip,

325
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,320
and we ask that you respect the privacy of the family members and employees who may be

326
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,320
caught up in this.

327
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,060
There are a few more notes that I might save for later, but the general message is that

328
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,100
they had no knowledge of this happening prior to fans communicating this with them, and

329
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,300
that once they were informed, they acted as swiftly and efficiently as they could, and

330
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,580
took an action that was obviously difficult for them, but they felt was necessary.

331
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,500
They stand by their response, and intend to move forward after they have provided a more

332
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,980
comprehensive statement.

333
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,860
This finishes the video, which appears to be at least a response to end certain roots

334
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,980
of speculation.

335
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,620
All the Try Guys appear rather worn down in the release, with many noting Eugene's apparent

336
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:53,060
anger, Keith's disgust, and Zack's upset, but all share this tone of clear annoyance

337
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,180
that the situation had reached this stage.

338
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,700
The response to this video was generally supportive from many viewers, particularly those who

339
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,100
were fans of the Try Guys, felt that this was a respectful and in-depth response that

340
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,300
dispelled the rumours.

341
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,980
Although they don't necessarily provide any evidence for this video, the timeline

342
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,800
made sense given the information available at that time.

343
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,320
Anyone involved who did speak on the matter appeared to corroborate what the Try Guys

344
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,320
said.

345
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,100
Nonetheless, there were a couple interesting pieces of information that cropped up shortly

346
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,300
after the video went live.

347
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,640
When you knew Ned was cheating in May...

348
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:39,720
The first was a TikTok posted on October 5th which allegedly showed Ned in a Burbank restaurant

349
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,060
with his producer in May, confirming what the Try Guys said about this relationship

350
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,420
occurring for a while.

351
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:48,060
This also substantiates earlier images that had been taken around May time which featured

352
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,060
the two together.

353
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,400
The person who posted this claimed to have messaged Ariel about this interaction back

354
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,040
then, but hadn't received a response.

355
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,280
The producer's fiancé responds to this TikTok stating that he wished he'd been

356
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,900
told, but given that TikTok unlikely didn't know the identity of the person Ned was seated

357
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,900
with, it wouldn't have been possible.

358
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,920
Not to soon after, a former Buzzfeed employee stated that they had personally had a large

359
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,000
falling out with Ned a few years prior, and stated that people at the workplace would

360
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,640
have a running joke that there were different Neds for different days, and he was notoriously

361
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,640
duplicitous, though he was apparently shocked by the brazenness of his actions of recent,

362
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,180
and implies that he expected more discretion from a hyper-competitive Yale graduate.

363
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,100
Although none of this information appeared to contradict what the Try Guys had shared

364
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,180
in their video, it did provide new angles to Ned and the history he held with his past

365
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,180
companies.

366
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,580
What we hope is that within this, there's also the opportunity for positive growth and

367
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,340
better videos ahead, but it's going to be hard.

368
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,820
This whole thing is going to be really fucking hard.

369
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:42,260
Although their video did set the record straight and away, their rather serious tone, whether

370
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:47,220
caused by fatigue or desire to show solidarity with affected parties, stressed gravitas and

371
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,480
naturally drew the media back into the fray.

372
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,840
In the next few days, many articles were published retelling the story of the Try Guys, and their

373
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,840
present drama.

374
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,160
Most of these stories didn't bring many new details to the table, but more served

375
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,880
as an accessibility ramp for those not versed in the drama as it transpired.

376
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,200
Emotions and tensions still remained somewhat high, stories were still coming from many

377
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,180
high profile news websites, more publicity than many far more controversial individuals

378
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,180
have received.

379
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,740
There had to be some way to control the fever that appeared to grasp people, and their interest

380
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,140
in a situation that the Try Guys would never have wanted in the first place.

381
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,820
Well, they did mention in their video that they had a longer statement to release, and

382
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,700
a few days after, they released it.

383
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,660
The Try Guys were at a bit of a crossroads, there was clearly a lot of information they

384
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,260
wanted to share their side on, but they also wanted to move past this torrent of media

385
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,460
attention as soon as possible.

386
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:42,300
They could wait for a bit for the coverage to die down, but then they'd potentially

387
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,340
be prolonging the drama, and who was to know that it wouldn't just re-emerge as soon

388
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,620
as they opened their mouths?

389
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,500
They needed something conclusive that also didn't provide more questions than it answers.

390
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,820
How are they going to do that?

391
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,820
Well.

392
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:57,380
We're four best friends who try stuff, we have a YouTube channel together, we happen

393
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:02,120
to live particularly insane lives, especially right now, and so this podcast is a chance

394
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,180
for us to hang out every week, talk, catch up, and just let you know what we're thinking

395
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,180
about.

396
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,700
One of the main adventures the Try Guys had embarked on upon leaving Buzzfeed was a podcast

397
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,700
called The Tripod.

398
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,340
At first, it involved all four members sitting down and talking about whatever was on their

399
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,260
mind in a less contrived environment.

400
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:21,220
Over time, though, Eugene appeared less, and three others appeared to take the reins, alongside

401
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,760
podcast producer Miles.

402
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,260
With Ned's unilateral withdrawal from the Try Guys and all affiliated media, there was

403
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:30,100
going to be a readjustment required for the podcast format, which originally had him sitting

404
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,100
next to Keith.

405
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,300
However, the Try Guys also saw an opportunity to use this up people as a way to make a more

406
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,300
official statement.

407
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,080
I use official in quotation marks here, because it's probably one of the most unofficial

408
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,900
official statements in recent corporate history, but it did kinda make sense.

409
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,900
Ned- Shall we?

410
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,900
Eugene- Go for it, man.

411
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,900
Ned- Okay.

412
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,900
Eugene- Well, here we are, everyone.

413
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,460
Ned- Welcome to the Try Pod to all of our normal listeners and no new people whatsoever.

414
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,320
When you first look at the video length of over an hour, you wouldn't be amiss for

415
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,180
perhaps being a bit concerned that this may feel like overkill, however the runtime is

416
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,780
aesthetically justified by a more relaxed environment that doesn't necessarily possess

417
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,060
the tension their previous video statement did.

418
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:09,060
As fans Eugene, Keith and Zack are provided emotional support from Mars, as they recount

419
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,780
the incident to the process and go into more depth on their own feelings regarding it all.

420
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,820
Keith- We knew that this would be big to our fans and people who had watched us in the

421
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,180
past, but I had no idea it would be this.

422
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:26,120
Zach- The New York Times, NPR, Rolling Stone, I mean these are publications that are huge

423
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,580
and we never thought would be concerned with us, and now certainly some of them are, who

424
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:37,140
are these guys and why does everyone care articles, but it showed that we had a really

425
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,700
big effect on a lot of people.

426
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:43,180
Keith- As we're talking, my family just sent me another Rolling Stone article that came

427
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,180
out an hour ago.

428
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:47,620
While the recurring themes from this video is that they really did not anticipate it

429
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:51,260
blowing up in the way that it did, and although they always intended to sack him, if they'd

430
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:54,580
had the choice, they would have done it a lot more quietly to avoid the sort of volatile

431
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,340
public reaction that a lot of parties involved have received, something that has taken a

432
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,340
toll on them all.

433
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,420
Zach- Have you ever thought that stress does not manifest physically?

434
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:11,300
Let me tell you, my back hurts, my BM's have been wild, the stress poops have been out

435
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:18,100
of control, have not been sleeping, and part of that is because there's just been so much

436
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,100
to do.

437
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,740
They remained steadfast in the narrative regarding how much they knew, stating that being contacted

438
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,340
by fans was the first time they had heard about it, and they moved as quickly as possible

439
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,580
to form an internal review.

440
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:31,260
A majority of the credit to handling this situation is given to Zach, who is the person

441
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,180
said to have overseen the operation that led to the removal of Ned from Second Tryer LLC,

442
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,880
given that Keith was on tour.

443
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,100
They say the secrecy wasn't exclusive to the public, and they couldn't even disclose

444
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:44,280
details of Ned's suspension to fellow employees, although they were pretty fast to deduce exactly

445
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,420
what had occurred.

446
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,940
With mind to the fact that this information had been uncovered by fans first, they intended

447
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,440
to wait until speculation had passed before releasing a statement, which explains why

448
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,700
they hadn't released one immediately upon Ned's dismissal.

449
00:27:54,700 --> 00:28:00,740
So to be clear, however this went down, we would have taken the same action.

450
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:06,380
But the fact that it was something that was caught by fans, that it was a transgression

451
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:11,540
that was enacted publicly, added a level of complication to this, where we knew there

452
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:15,360
was this stick of dynamite with an uncertain fuse.

453
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:21,520
You have to really have things in line to legally be able to say some things.

454
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,560
And even then, also, you're not just doing things out of fear of legal action, you're

455
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:32,080
doing things out of fear of public backlash to other parties involved.

456
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,380
So you're really trying, like, I don't want people who are hurt to become more hurt,

457
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:42,520
I don't want to do something wrong and get sued and further jeopardise the company and

458
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,520
people's jobs.

459
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,680
In the original video statement, they're afraid to make any character judgements towards

460
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
their former colleague.

461
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,280
In the podcast, they still play their cards relative close to their chest, but there are

462
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,440
the occasional moments where they let some emotion surface, especially when clearing

463
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,960
up speculation, there seems to be an air of disdain for Ned and his handling of the situation.

464
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:06,240
No, we shared what our statement was going to be, we did not have insight into what his

465
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,480
statement was.

466
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,000
I also want to say that we did not coordinate fonts, I believe that he saw ours and copied

467
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
it.

468
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
That is our opinion.

469
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,680
And it is an opinion that I'm not happy about.

470
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:24,360
When I saw that, I'm like, you got to choose the same font that made it look like we wrote

471
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,360
your...

472
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,960
It's my opinion that that was on purpose.

473
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,760
That was too optimised result for him.

474
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,760
That's my opinion.

475
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,320
Additionally, there's an interesting clip towards the end where Keith begins to talk

476
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,060
about the sentiment of betrayal, before Zach cuts it back to a more detached perspective

477
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,360
of the matter.

478
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,760
Keith, final one here is if this hadn't gone public, was there a world where Ned came back

479
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,080
and was a cast member?

480
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,080
No.

481
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,080
No.

482
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,080
Yeah.

483
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,080
And maybe speak to why.

484
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,080
No.

485
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,620
Look, what happened, it betrayed our trust.

486
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,160
And it was a workplace violation.

487
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,160
It was a workplace violation.

488
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:08,000
It would mean to all the people in our office who knew what they knew, they would know that

489
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,960
we were in the face of everything like not being true to who we say we are in our values.

490
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,440
So like, very simply, he would have been removed.

491
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,560
There's a sense that even if they were to speak openly about their emotions, they're

492
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,480
aware of the possible implications of riling up fans and viewers, some that they also speak

493
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,240
about, emphasizing that people mess up and don't necessarily deserve death threats,

494
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,800
although they do exclude Ned from this narrative.

495
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,720
It's just like really, really scary.

496
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,160
Like to get, you know, I'm sure that their DMs are full of crazy messages and just feel

497
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:42,620
it's, it can make you feel really like no one in the world likes you anymore.

498
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,620
And that can be hard.

499
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,880
I know for a fact that people have received death threats because of this.

500
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:52,040
I know that people, you know, their past has been dredged up and they, look, a bad thing

501
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,560
happened and we reacted accordingly and did what we had to do.

502
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:00,120
Actions have repercussions, but...

503
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,360
It would be a lot for the strongest person to handle.

504
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,640
As an episode of the podcast that seeks to find the balance between explaining the situation

505
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,120
without provoking it, they seem to do a fair job, and they clear up some misconceptions,

506
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,680
but there was one more matter they needed to discuss, which wasn't covered in their

507
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,680
original response video.

508
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,680
That being, what now?

509
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,560
I don't know.

510
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:27,040
I think if this didn't happen, there is a world in which the Try Guys cast, you know,

511
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,960
like how do I want to say this?

512
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:38,360
For the last two years, frankly, I've kind of personally gone through this mental process

513
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:46,640
of acceptance, of realising that where I want to grow and what the Try Guys is are different.

514
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,840
There have been a lot of speculations as to whether there would be a new Try Guy, including

515
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,240
from the roster of people they currently collaborated with.

516
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,240
Keith and Zack confirmed that this is not happening, and that the Try Guys that people

517
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,840
had come to know would no longer exist, and although the situation had been exhausting

518
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,920
and distressing, they did see an opportunity within the tragedy to move forward.

519
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,520
Zack in particular expresses this idea that the Try Guys had become rather rigid, and

520
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,200
incapable of the sort of growth that he desired from life.

521
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,120
These circumstances, albeit unfortunate, allowed them to reassess how they wanted to develop

522
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,240
as a collective and individuals.

523
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:20,320
And sometimes like a good laugh is a relief and a piece of content that you need, but

524
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:28,760
more and more we are going to allow the Try Guys to grow with us, to adapt as we adapt,

525
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:34,000
and to bring in new creative people like Kwesi, like a myriad of people you know on

526
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,680
this channel, and allow them that opportunity to make stuff that's deeply important to

527
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,680
them.

528
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
And that's that.

529
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,000
It seems that the controversy in the subsequent coverage had tainted the Try Guys' name

530
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,840
in their mind, and that was not easy for people who had built their brand around that, but

531
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,720
maybe it had also been holding them back, and this was something, finally, that could

532
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,720
propel them forward.

533
00:32:52,720 --> 00:33:03,000
The Try Guys' second statement appeared to satisfy most of social media and the mainstream

534
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,400
media in explaining what transpired and their plans to move forward from it.

535
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,840
It was good to have a response that grasped the scope of the situation while not necessarily

536
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,860
dramatising or downplaying it.

537
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:15,200
This seemed to be a good point for all to draw the line under the situation, but little

538
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,480
did they know, the narrative was soon going to shift.

539
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:22,280
It would not have been this public spectacle, we probably would have tried to avoid that

540
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:27,200
for the sake of the other people involved, but it happened how it happened.

541
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,680
At multiple points in the podcast, Keith and Zach's threats they did not expect, nor

542
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,920
did they want the situation to blow up like it has, and they were very upset about the

543
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,800
speculation and involvement from external parties.

544
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,960
There was this sense that people needed to step back and remember that although this

545
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,480
was obviously emotionally effective for some people, there also needed to be a sense of

546
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,480
perspective.

547
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,400
Who was going to provide that perspective though?

548
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:51,400
Alright, well, let's take a look at our final Jeopardy category, Lives That Matter.

549
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:59,560
Well, it was good while it lasted though.

550
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,240
This is Saturday Night Live, a comedy sketch show that has become a mainstay of late night

551
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,240
TV.

552
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,760
It has gradually evolved with the media and political landscape, and has persisted to

553
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,620
stay relevant with an array of guest stars and performing acts.

554
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,960
Despite pulling sizeable view counts, younger generations haven't exactly taken to its

555
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,960
brand of heavy-handed and often cringe-inducing humour, especially given that their sketches

556
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,400
often focus on topics that older audiences buy more affinity with.

557
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,940
So it may have come as a surprise to viewers, when out of all the internet dramas one could

558
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:40,160
potentially satirise, SNL decided to produce a sketch about the Try Guys, featuring high-profile

559
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,800
Oscar-nominated actor Brendan Gleeson, who I'm sure is chuffed to be a part of this

560
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,120
slice of internet history.

561
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,080
The sketch follows a news anchor who is attempting to report on the latest current affairs, but

562
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,360
is continuously interrupted by their field correspondent who wishes to report on the

563
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,360
Try Guys drama.

564
00:34:53,360 --> 00:35:18,480
The

565
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,120
sketch also references the Try Guys original response video, which features caricatures

566
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,000
of the cast members, who also avidly interrupt the news to try and make the situation about

567
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
them, which derails the news bulletin entirely with the anchor's voice of reason being

568
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:56,120
drowned out.

569
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,600
In spite of the laugh tracks, many viewers did not see the funny side of this, especially

570
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,240
when they felt SNL had missed the point of the situation, with many referring to SNL's

571
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,760
past on-set controversies as consistent with the message of this sketch.

572
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,040
The sketch's message appears at first to be lampooning the media's response, but

573
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,280
quickly sets their sights on the Try Guys themselves, and what they perceive to be their

574
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,840
over-dramatic handling of the video, whilst still ignoring the follow-up response from

575
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,840
Zach and Keith.

576
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,020
Amongst dedicated fans, theories spread that Ned's background in comedy was allowing

577
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:25,040
him to pull some strings to hit back without attaching his name to it, and many refer to

578
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,200
clips where Ned had spoken about having ties to SNL.

579
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,060
Interestingly enough, on the same podcast episode, the producer that he had cheated

580
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:50,000
on his wife with also spoke about their connections on the show.

581
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,520
This was obviously completely conjectural, but was also a potential explanation for why

582
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,440
SNL decided to dip their toes in YouTube drama at this specific time.

583
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,720
Many collaborates with the Try Guys mostly made the case for them on social media, while

584
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,280
the Try Guys themselves moreover attempted to say as little as possible, or at least

585
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,880
see the funny side of it.

586
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,240
Nevertheless, this trust was appearing to get the better of some members, as Zach in

587
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,080
particular ended up in a spat with Dream, something that he felt was the result of the

588
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:17,240
past few weeks, and the inability to talk about details that he felt had been misrepresented

589
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,240
in the media.

590
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:43,560
It also appeared to be causing tension between audience members and people who were associated

591
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,040
with any critical content.

592
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,960
It was also reported that, in a short Instagram Live section, Bowen Yang, who played Eugene

593
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,640
in the SNL sketch, spoke briefly about the subsequent backlash, stating that they may

594
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,320
have misunderstood how it all played out, but also felt that people who were not involved

595
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,600
with the piece were being implicated, and that this was simply not the case.

596
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,840
He also felt the Try Guys had incited audience members to attack them as their podcast account

597
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,360
had received rather significant levels of harassment.

598
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,320
There is no evidence of any direct incitement, but it seems like emotion still ran high within

599
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,840
the Try Guys and their audience, particularly in how they are responding to a decision that

600
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,680
would be emotional for a lot of people.

601
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,600
Nonetheless, poorly received by many as it was, the SNL sketch did represent a sect of

602
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,920
the online populace that didn't really understand why what the Try Guys did had to be such a

603
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,120
monumental decision, and that although acknowledging what Ned did was wrong, didn't feel that

604
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:32,280
he should be spoken about and treated in such a way, a way that to them provoked the worst

605
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,960
of the internet to launch a very emotionally charged response to anybody involved.

606
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:43,240
We have prided ourselves for the last eight years on being undramatic boys, and I cannot

607
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,640
wait to go back there.

608
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,920
Although the Try Guys seem to have quashed concerns regarding their knowledge of Ned

609
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,720
Fulmer's infidelity, or the concern that they did not act quickly or take it seriously

610
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,640
enough, a new narrative was being raised by the media, as to whether they had overcorrected

611
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:59,320
and caused people to feel too invested in a situation that was ultimately not their

612
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,320
business.

613
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,200
It really looked like the Try Guys couldn't win, no matter how hard they tried.

614
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:18,560
The truth was that the Try Guys were placed in a very awkward position, because on one

615
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,040
hand they wanted to clear up these misconceptions, but on the other they were deeply aware of

616
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,640
the possible legal ramifications of doing so, which allowed people who weren't necessarily

617
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,200
confined by those chains to speculate, and if the Try Guys attempted to respond, there

618
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,320
were concerns of harassment given how deeply invested many people were in this drama.

619
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:57,600
Most of the time they were bound to silence, but some felt that this was their own doing.

620
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,360
Towards the end of October, once again the media decided to take advantage of this silence,

621
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,760
this time in the form of a more academic think piece from the New York Times, a paper

622
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,800
that had previously published and updated an article following the Try Guys drama, something

623
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,200
they covered from the jump.

624
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,880
Their article this time, The Try Guys and the Prison of Online Fame, approaches the

625
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,440
matter from a more philosophical standpoint, and seeks to explain the Try Guys' response

626
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,800
from the perspective of fan appeasement, describing their first response as resembling a hostage

627
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,520
video and their supposed outrage as a performance, attempting to calm the nerds of distrustful

628
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,720
and anxious fans.

629
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,080
The author acknowledges the power dynamics, but still questions why the Try Guys spoke

630
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,640
about Ned like he was John Wayne Gacy, ultimately concluding that there likely was this understanding

631
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:39,200
from the Try Guys that it wasn't that big a deal, but that they acted more out of threat

632
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,120
of losing audience than anything else.

633
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:45,080
Beer's response to this was similarly hostile, with many audiences stating that this sought

634
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,640
to downplay a serious situation, but the author of the article would probably state that these

635
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,680
are the people that the Try Guys were seeking to appease, so there would be little movement

636
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,880
in that discourse.

637
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,880
Keith's wife responded to this article expressing annoyance at its existence, but otherwise

638
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,240
there wasn't a matter response, and the article did accrue a fair amount of twitter

639
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,720
likes, so that's some metric I suppose.

640
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,460
The media continued to loiter around the situation for a bit, playing with narratives that often

641
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,640
surrounded business, but all in all there was silence for a while.

642
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,240
The Try Guys did not want to be caught defending their decisions forever, and they likely knew

643
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,480
that they had to move on.

644
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,800
In the coming weeks they appeared to do this, the producer appeared to remove any credits

645
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,040
of her involvement with the Try Guys, and the Try Guys stopped crediting her in video

646
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,680
descriptions, implying a mutual agreement for her departure had also been reached.

647
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,400
Ned was also gradually edited and written out, where possible, the title card for their

648
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,520
new season of their show Without A Recipe was subtitled Everything Is Fine, a totally

649
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,440
normal season, and Ned who appeared in episodes that were recorded before his suspension was

650
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,320
now replaced with an animated elephant.

651
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,560
They also edited old thumbnails of Without A Recipe to exclude Ned, likely anticipating

652
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,560
the release of the show, and would intend to disassociate him from the series as a whole,

653
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,760
especially given that it was one of the series they were promoting through a more commercial

654
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,760
platform, Kizwii.

655
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,040
However, with this in mind, they had to move back towards promotional work eventually,

656
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,680
part of their channel required them to exist in the public sphere, and although it felt

657
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,280
like people's interest in the subject had waned in the weeks prior, it also didn't

658
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,240
feel like they'd fully moved on from it.

659
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,160
What steps were they going to take to ensure that?

660
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,600
Well the first was an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, where Habersberger, Yang, and Kornfeld

661
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,760
talk about their plans to move forward from the scandal of the past few months.

662
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,880
They talk about their upcoming projects, in particular Without A Recipe, state that they

663
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,560
intend to remain as the Try Guys, but also that they intend to move away from the viral

664
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,320
content that made them popular, and towards broadcast TV, as they feel they can work on

665
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,160
more ambitious projects and invest more resources, something they've probably felt constrained

666
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,160
by in the past.

667
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,800
YG- Can I plant an idea in your head, guys?

668
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:39,320
YG- Please, just consider it, I think it's a real good option.

669
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,200
The first few questions go by pretty likely, but then Eugene chimes in to discuss the media

670
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,040
coverage of the issue, talking about how they had presented the Try Guys as a happy-go-lucky

671
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,580
troupe to contrast that image against the drama, and pointing out that they had readily

672
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:54,460
tackled many more serious and sobering topics, ones that people who didn't merely take a

673
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,100
cursory glance would have known.

674
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:59,020
He aligns their handling of these subjects with their response, and states that other

675
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:03,460
workplaces with more traditional values simply aren't as upfront, and he's proud of the team's

676
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,100
reaction to what transpired.

677
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:08,240
They talk about upcoming projects such as Kees' Off-Broadway show with a general tone

678
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,180
of optimism, and that reiterates what he said in the podcast episode, this was the best

679
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:16,040
outcome for them, calling it an evolution point, and not too soon after they decide

680
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,540
to start that evolution.

681
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,940
Well, what a year it's been!

682
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:22,940
F*** yeah.

683
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:27,860
On the 17th of December, the Try Guys uploaded a video titled What Happens Next, sat down

684
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:30,540
on the couch once more, reminiscent of their first video.

685
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:34,180
This time, they appear to be in much higher spirits, though they do have some pretty significant

686
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,500
announcements to make.

687
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,600
Look, that era of the Try Guys is officially over.

688
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:45,000
It was an incredible, once in a lifetime ride, and we really, truly, honestly cannot thank

689
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,900
you enough for being a part of it.

690
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:57,580
But, with happy endings comes the opportunity for happier beginnings, and as the Try Guys,

691
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,580
we're just getting started.

692
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,700
Although they state that this era of the Try Guys will be coming to an end, they also set

693
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,540
forth their plans for the coming year, including multiple projects that will be more ambitious

694
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:13,720
and high production, also using this upload as a preview for their interactive live finale

695
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,980
of Without A Recipe.

696
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:19,260
We're working on sorts, all sorts of crazy stuff.

697
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:24,860
It's going to mean taking some risks, doing things that maybe aren't as algorithm-optimized,

698
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:29,420
but honestly, f*** it, f*** it.

699
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,520
We only give them a life.

700
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:36,660
We have the Without A Recipe live finale, we got five incredible main season episodes

701
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,800
this year, and tonight, we're doing something we've never done before, our little something

702
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:46,200
extra special, six cameras, live cooking, live voting, live judging, live Keith yelling,

703
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,200
perhaps?

704
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,200
Perhaps.

705
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,640
All in all, despite the video including aesthetic callbacks to their What Happened upload, it

706
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,960
doesn't feel like they're trying to necessarily emulate it, more rewrite it, and associate

707
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,240
it with the evolution that Zack had previously alluded to in the Hollywood Reporter interview.

708
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,520
Although accruing a few million views, the news cycle didn't really pick up from it,

709
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,620
and it appears that the storm had mostly passed finally, Ned had remained silent on all social

710
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:12,640
media platforms since his parting statement, which almost seemed like a silent seal of

711
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,420
validation for the crew and their plans to take the group forward into greener pastures.

712
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:28,660
What would they find there though?

713
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:44,220
The newer era of the Try Guys may not appear particularly striking on the surface, they

714
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,460
haven't exactly changed too much about their YouTube content, it's still built off a

715
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:51,140
similar premise, and outside of that, other than the rather subtle rebranding, there's

716
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,660
nothing that will particularly jump out at the average viewer.

717
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:57,100
With that said, they have been experimenting with certain concepts, such as the interactive

718
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:00,220
experience they tried on Kizwii the year before, recently announcing that they would

719
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:04,320
be performing Romeo and Juliet, but with the audience deciding and voting on how certain

720
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:21,660
scenes and plotlines are resolved, however it was also about what was going on beyond

721
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:24,700
the Try Guys, and how their lives were developing as individuals.

722
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:28,020
There was this sense that the Try Guys label was somewhat constraining on its own, and

723
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,000
that they should be engaging in their own ventures.

724
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,720
Keith turned up to VidCon with his comedy band, Lou Burger, and performed a few tunes

725
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:37,480
of their own, went on a small tour, and even performed a sold out off-Broadway musical,

726
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,540
The Wizard of Friendship.

727
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:42,220
Keith arguably has the most consistently successful series on the Try Guys YouTube channel with

728
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:45,260
his Eats Everything uploads, which is what it sounds like.

729
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,480
Zack Gia was seemingly busy, but probably the most significant development in his life

730
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,260
was the news that he had officially tied the knot with his partner Maggie, which was pretty

731
00:46:52,260 --> 00:47:03,220
notable given that many doubted that it would ever happen.

732
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:07,040
Eugene probably had the most eventful year of them all though, securing two voice acting

733
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,160
roles in major productions, Nimona and Star Wars Visions, he was also cast in an upcoming

734
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,820
live-action romance film, but the details of that aren't too well known, other than

735
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:15,980
it sounds pretty gay.

736
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:19,660
He also announced that he would be writing a two-part young adult fantasy book called

737
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:22,120
The Unders, to be released in 2024.

738
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:25,760
Not too much is known about that either, other than it sounds pretty gay.

739
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,000
He's probably the least featured in YouTube videos due to the pursuit of these ventures,

740
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,720
but he still clearly considers himself part of the posse, and continues to involve himself

741
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,720
where needed.

742
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:37,280
It's clear that over time he much prefers the more performative side of media, and doesn't

743
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,360
necessarily want to bear too much of his private life, often leaving Keith and Zack to represent

744
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,440
the group in podcasts and media interviews.

745
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,680
With this in mind, the dynamic of the Try Guys appears to have changed a little, and

746
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,580
whereas in the past, Zack had been portrayed as the baby of the group, now he seemed to

747
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,340
have taken up a more vocal position.

748
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:54,700
This side was definitely on show in the podcast episode addressing the situation, but many

749
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,220
were still pleasantly surprised to see him this outspoken, it allowed him to convey a

750
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:01,500
degree of confidence in his narratives, which was important when Ned was still a common

751
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:05,620
subject of discourse for many, and yet a highly sensitive one where any verbal blunder could

752
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,980
result in a lawsuit.

753
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:10,800
Now, we are finding our company in a much healthier place.

754
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,880
I think that it brought us all together, it allowed us to reevaluate what we want to focus

755
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:26,200
our energies on, and to shape the company and our image to be less driven maybe by short

756
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:32,320
term goals, and to really recommit to our audience what we care about.

757
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,840
Yeah, in spite of all that pressure, they seem to be handling it well, they don't

758
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,160
seem too fussed about the notion of variety anymore, more interested in consolidating

759
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,720
their audience and creating a strong relationship with them.

760
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,600
They mostly refrain from talking about Ned himself, though it's clear that they do

761
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:48,440
feel betrayed by his actions, and even seem suspicious of subsequent events that occurred

762
00:48:48,440 --> 00:49:00,280
such as the SNL sketch.

763
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,920
With that said though, they seemed to be content with the outcome, although they had seen success

764
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,000
akin to a sort of fever dream in the past, being woken by the scandal had allowed them

765
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,800
to reevaluate their priorities and mature as a group.

766
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,720
There is this renewed sense of unity rooted in that tough situation, and how they subsequently

767
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,720
navigated it.

768
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,920
Their concern was maintaining those principles that they felt were built on, and in retrospect

769
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:26,160
they felt they had succeeded in doing that.

770
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,460
Maybe the Try Guys would never be as ubiquitous as they once were, but they didn't seem

771
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:33,820
too fazed by that, more focusing on content and strategies that matured as they felt they

772
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:36,980
had, and experiencing a degree of shared stability through it.

773
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:41,580
After all, they'd never expected this success in 2014 when it all began, anything was just

774
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,580
a bonus.

775
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,820
Audiences who were still around expressed that they found the new Dynamite quite enjoyable,

776
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,540
and didn't find themselves missing Ned one bit.

777
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:52,120
Some found themselves reflecting on old clips and wondering if he ever really fit in, though

778
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,740
some still expressed sadness that the child had lost Ariel and wished her well.

779
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:56,980
But what about the pair?

780
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,100
Were they still even a pair?

781
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,200
While since pledging to put family first, there have been mostly radio silence from

782
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:07,080
Ned and his relative social media platforms for the majority of 2023, with some speculating

783
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,740
on the status of his marriage with Ariel.

784
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:12,580
Well, just shy of 11 months after he had been dismissed from the Try Guys, Ned appeared

785
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:16,380
on his sister Grace's Instagram story, looking like he had prematurely entered his mid-life

786
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:21,220
crisis, attending Taylor Swift's era's tour with no one other than his wife, Ariel.

787
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:24,220
They appeared to be in good spirits, and left the concert together as well.

788
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:27,820
Although this was not shared by Ariel or Ned, it quickly made its way online, as outlets

789
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:31,540
reported that even after the Try Guys had officially cut ties with Ned, his marriage

790
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:35,340
remained sturdy, and many viewers and fans expressed shock towards Ned and Ariel for

791
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:36,340
making amends.

792
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,180
I'll discuss that more in a bit though.

793
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:41,720
Nonetheless, although Ned seems to have refrained from speaking about the situation, and there

794
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:45,100
are still questions hanging over his head regarding it, he seems to have retained what

795
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,500
was always most important in his life, his family.

796
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:53,800
In the end, although it was a rather painful process, maybe everyone got what they wanted.

797
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,660
Allow me to elaborate.

798
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:06,780
At the start of the video, I spoke about the notion of growth, and how, with many collectives,

799
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:10,400
it's very difficult to keep them together when individual goals are constantly changing

800
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,400
and evolving.

801
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,500
When you have a team of people like Team 10 where everyone is vying for their own taste

802
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:18,980
of stardom, the creative constraints that can be placed on one can feel extremely suffocating.

803
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:23,500
The Try Guys would never like Team 10 though, for them, the success was always a bonus.

804
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,260
There was a strong level of trust between each individual, and members were allowed

805
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:29,060
to go off and pursue ventures on their own terms.

806
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:32,500
Why I left Buzzfeed is really this.

807
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:37,260
The whole time we felt like there was more that we could be doing and giving to you,

808
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,260
and now's that time.

809
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:41,020
At the same time, when you create something, there's still the desire to move forward

810
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:44,380
with it, and that was illustrated with their departure from Buzzfeed, that was the freedom

811
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,980
that they had yearned for, and they appeared to make the most of it.

812
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:50,300
This sort of trust between the members allowed them to grow the Try Guys as a brand while

813
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,220
also exploring their own interests.

814
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:55,820
With that said, there's always the threat that maybe a creative avenue has been exhausted.

815
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:59,340
Even with complete control, your brand is still regulated by the premises that you set

816
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:00,340
it up on.

817
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:03,560
With people associating your names with a certain idea of content, it can be very difficult

818
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:15,060
to escape the shadow that viral content can create.

819
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:18,820
By Covid lockdown era, the Try Guys had been going for 7 years, and although they clearly

820
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:22,260
enjoyed what they were doing, they were trying to break out of the cage that they had often

821
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:26,400
been assigned to by the media, as the happy-go-lucky Buzzfeed chaps who just wanted to do things

822
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,400
for a laugh.

823
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,780
Any behaviour outside of the pre-conditioned ideas would surely shatter the brand that

824
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,180
they had so carefully assembled over the years.

825
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:36,700
Unfortunately, that's what restlessness begets within an individual.

826
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,920
Restlessness can be externalised through a variety of expressions, for some it's exploring

827
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,940
new creative avenues, for others it's about perfecting their craft in a current one.

828
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:47,020
Restlessness is something that can often beget growth and forward movement in a person's

829
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:50,380
life, the desire to do something more, and nevertheless, it can also be something quite

830
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:54,260
negative, it can yield reckless, thrill-seeking behaviour that may not necessarily be within

831
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:56,440
the bounds of what's expected of them.

832
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,680
Restlessness is not something that can only manifest itself within a career, it can evince

833
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,380
itself over any part of a person's life that may seem stagnant to them.

834
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:06,820
Every single one of the Try Guys probably experienced that restlessness in some sense,

835
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:10,100
I'm sure they'd all gone through a phase of considering leaving the trip, creating

836
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:13,700
their own path, pursuing what they cared about, they were probably wondering how to address

837
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:14,700
that lull.

838
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:31,260
And then along came Ned, I can't look into Ned's mind and tell everyone exactly why

839
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:35,060
he did what he did, I don't think he's some evil big who wanted to wreck years of

840
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:36,060
hard work.

841
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:39,180
Although many people haven't exactly heaped praise onto his character, most have refrained

842
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:43,260
from representing him as this cruel or malevolent figure, more of portraying him as someone

843
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:46,620
who was not entirely up front with the person he truly was at work.

844
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:49,940
Instead of possibly seeking to address the issues that were challenging him within his

845
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:53,860
personal and work life, he likely chose to address his frustrations by pursuing a life

846
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:58,100
outside of the Try Guys, yet as his family became more aligned with his work he turned

847
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:02,660
away from that as well, finding a workplace affair as the slice of life that he desired.

848
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:06,780
There was no ambiguity given how long it persisted for, he wanted it, and although some people

849
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:10,180
may not have been shocked by it, they did seem to be shocked about how public he ended

850
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:11,180
up being with it.

851
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:14,900
Boldly sacrificing an image he had spent years constructing, and placing the public

852
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:18,820
image of the Try Guys into jeopardy, Ned was someone with a degree of intelligence, and

853
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:22,120
although some wouldn't be wrong to assign arrogance to his behaviour, there was a sense

854
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,980
that he just didn't really care about what he created, or the repercussions his actions

855
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,060
could have, until they revealed themselves.

856
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:31,900
Ned Fomer is no longer working with the Try Guys.

857
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:35,380
Whereas Zach, Keith, and Eugene may have possessed different ideas for how they wanted the Try

858
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:39,740
Guys to be represented, their unanimity in response to Ned's infidelity, regardless

859
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:43,700
of whether one believes it's proportionate, brought them back onto the same page mentally.

860
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,980
There appeared to be no second thoughts to how this should be dealt with, and they seemed

861
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:50,740
to act as swiftly as they conceivably could, in spite of the many legal hurdles that may

862
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:53,860
present themselves in removing a member as established as Ned.

863
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:57,420
Nevertheless, although this may have united them in the sense of how they felt about this

864
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,780
issue, there was still the threat of tearing down everything they ever constructed, but

865
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,020
in time it seemed like that's what they needed.

866
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:06,380
The Try Guys possessed a desire to move forward, but when you've been established for years

867
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:09,820
with your own company, with everything you require to succeed, it can be hard to see

868
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:11,980
where you can even move forward from that.

869
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,940
Sometimes you have to go back first.

870
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:17,920
Ned's actions did that indubitably, it snapped the Try Guys out of the cycle they've been

871
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,940
living for so long, and forced them to step outside their frequency brand image to address

872
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:23,760
a man who had broken his.

873
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,700
No longer were the Try Guys perceived as the friction-free kings that so many audiences

874
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:31,980
found comfort in, they had their own struggle, but in that struggle they seemed to find their

875
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:43,300
own liberation.

876
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:47,580
The Try Guys had spent their post-buzzfeed time trying to establish more distinct relationships

877
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:51,700
between their individual members and their fans, and the characters they created, but

878
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:56,140
for the first time in a while it felt like the Try Guys had something new together, even

879
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:58,060
if it was with one less member.

880
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:02,340
No longer was that struggle provoking sentiments of separation that might pull them apart,

881
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:04,780
it was that struggle that brought them together.

882
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:08,060
There was a sense that maybe all the Try Guys were looking for more, and that the more they

883
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:13,560
could be looking for could be achieved in that world without Ned.

884
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:23,060
It was the best outcome, but was it the just outcome?

885
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:37,780
I think the SNL sketch got it 50% correct.

886
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:41,900
We talk about a lot of internet drama as creators, a lot of it remains within the confines of

887
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:45,860
YouTube though, and occasionally makes the rounds of peripheral social media-oriented

888
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:46,860
outlets.

889
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:50,300
At a glance it's confusing to look at this situation, one can't help but wonder, out

890
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:54,060
of all the stories that we cover online, that this one was the one that picked up the

891
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:57,700
most traction on mainstream outlets, when there are so many more pressing issues in

892
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:01,700
the world they could be turning their attention to, but nothing happens without a reason,

893
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:06,020
and in reality there were a few conditions that likely made this subject more media friendly.

894
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:10,620
First being that the Try Guys were, as creators go, inherently industry friendly themselves,

895
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:14,620
they were YouTube based but possessed name recognition outside of it, second this wasn't

896
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:18,460
a common occurrence, they were rather white bread, and any white bread character caught

897
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:21,380
up in debauchery is always good clickbait.

898
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:25,340
Third cheating isn't a crime, when a YouTuber finds themselves caught up in something more

899
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:29,340
legally tender, news outlets can find themselves rather hesitant in case they accidentally

900
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:32,140
publicise something that could be construed as libel.

901
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:35,540
Although they probably would be able to argue good faith in court, most of the time they

902
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:39,780
simply don't want to, the Try Guys scandal simply was the perfect combination of news

903
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:43,980
that was surprising enough to grab the attention of media outlets, yet PG enough to report

904
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:45,720
on with some degree of confidence.

905
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:49,480
It was too much for the actual story, and it inevitably caused a lot of undue coverage

906
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:53,720
and harassment of all individuals involved, but the SNL sketch didn't stop there, it

907
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,320
implied that the Try Guys contributed to that with their video on the matter.

908
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:02,180
Look at me, this is the face of grief.

909
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:05,800
This angle represented a more sceptical side of the internet that felt that this hadn't

910
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:09,300
been handled with respect to the family at the centre of it, and was merely published

911
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:13,120
as a way for them to rescue their reputation that had been brought into contention by the

912
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,120
scandal.

913
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:17,400
This was echoed by the NYT think piece, which didn't necessarily appear hostile to the

914
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:21,260
Try Guys, more presented them as a victim of internet culture, being forced to throw

915
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:24,120
their friend under the bus to save their own skins.

916
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:27,640
After all, Ned former was not our generation's Ted Bundy, was he?

917
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:34,800
In new photos captured Wednesday, Ned walks ahead of Ariel, looking unfazed by the scandal,

918
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,800
and in this snap, her expression says it all.

919
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,800
It's somewhat strange to see part of the source of mass attention pointing fingers

920
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,680
at the Try Guys responding to a situation that the media blew up.

921
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,900
The Try Guys didn't want to have to defend themselves in that way, but the theories were

922
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:53,160
manifesting every single day, and their response, although somewhat terse, was the best way

923
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,680
they could muster up under considerable pressure.

924
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,080
Their language sought to relay a timeline of events, but also exonerate themselves from

925
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,080
any knowledge.

926
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:03,420
They wanted to halt the speculation in the clearest way possible, but their personal

927
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,680
sentiments still reached the surface.

928
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:09,120
The truth is though, that there was always going to be a personal element to it, and

929
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:12,840
it's very hard to navigate that while also being sensitive to the legality of Ned's

930
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,840
removal.

931
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,960
In a way, by stating what were perceived as facts, rather than actually delving into their

932
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,780
feelings, but still not necessarily being able to completely subdue their emotions,

933
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:24,840
they turn what they viewed as a simple workplace violation into a very loaded discourse.

934
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:28,600
There was a lot they probably would have said behind the scenes, they did not say here.

935
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,840
Probably one of the most telling moments was Keith being cut off before he could speak

936
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,000
properly about that sentiment of betrayal.

937
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:40,880
What happened, it betrayed our trust, and it was a workplace violation, it would mean

938
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:46,160
to all the people in our office who knew what they knew, they would know that we were in

939
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:50,120
the face of everything, like not being true to who we say we are in our value.

940
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:53,880
I think betrayal is what underlined a lot of the emotional response by the Try Guys.

941
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,960
So some critics, Ned's actions wouldn't or shouldn't have resulted in a dismissal, which

942
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:01,100
is why they may not necessarily see why it bothered them so much.

943
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:04,160
On the other hand, if it was such a cut and dry decision, then why do they need these

944
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,840
videos to justify themselves?

945
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:09,500
There are loads of questions that one might ask to put into contention the often complicated

946
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:13,820
reasons issued in that time, and these seemingly often austere measures, such as fully erasing

947
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:18,080
Ned's presence from pre-recorded videos, but the reality is that what isn't spoken about

948
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,780
is probably what they felt more.

949
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:24,180
For the Try Guys, firing Ned was exactly why it mattered so much, regardless of what motive

950
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:27,940
Ned had behind his actions, outside the fact that he had put up this family man facade

951
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:31,240
to all of them while maintaining an at least months long workplace relationship to the

952
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:34,100
others rather than just being upfront with them and admitting he was struggling with

953
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:37,500
his faithfulness, he must've known what he was putting at stake by doing this, not just

954
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:41,760
the entire brand image but also their friendship which was largely tied up in that business.

955
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:45,000
These are the guys who had built an empire together for 8 years, who had crafted such

956
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,260
a deep relationship, not just with their viewers but with each other, and where some would

957
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:52,060
argue that the Try Guys sold Ned down the river and discarded those memories, putting

958
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:55,920
their interests above those of a friend, it was Ned who really put his own personal interests

959
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:00,100
above those of his friends first, doing it so brazenly to the point where even fans took

960
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:03,660
notice, either he thought his friends wouldn't take action against him despite him lying

961
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,420
to them and his audience, or he didn't care enough about what repercussions they would

962
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:11,340
have to sanction and the stress it may invoke, both scenarios that show a disregard for that

963
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:13,620
friendship he proclaimed so loudly.

964
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:16,860
Even if you don't believe the Try Guys claims that they would've dismissed Ned regardless

965
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:20,780
of who informed them, the exhaustion and frustration of having someone you think fondly of putting

966
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:24,640
the onus on you to punish them when you would rather be helping them sort their shit out

967
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:28,700
is an incredibly draining experience, Keith, Zach, and Eugene took no pleasure in what

968
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:32,000
they did, and I think that's what people see when watching that video, the sadness

969
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,380
of losing a colleague, a friend, and questioning why it had to happen, and sure you could say

970
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:40,540
that it didn't have to happen that way, that all the reactions airbrushing his existence

971
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:44,700
were not necessary, and I get that, but for the Try Guys at least it made sense in that

972
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:49,500
moment, because to them he'd already separated himself through his actions, so they separated

973
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,500
him.

974
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:59,000
Even if it made sense that the media were predisposed to cover this subject, it was

975
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,280
still surprising for all, even the Try Guys, but their decision was already made, and for

976
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:07,540
the media to present their public explanation of actions they'd already carried out in private

977
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:12,040
as performative felt more like a way to account for their own excitement surrounding a situation

978
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:16,260
which they probably would have all rather handled in private anyway, and yet it became

979
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:19,780
greater than most internet dramas will ever be.

980
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:27,580
For a brief spell, Ned Forman was one of the most maligned people online, and that just

981
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:32,340
didn't make sense to some, and to be honest, I understand it, although I would say that

982
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:36,260
the Try Guys response was pretty proportional to the amount they were probably put through

983
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:40,460
when overseeing this situation and its aftermath, there definitely was something outside of

984
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:44,660
his actions and the media response that made people on social media take more personal

985
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:46,900
umbrage with him than they should have.

986
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:47,900
How come?

987
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:53,200
Ned Forman- If some cheating is happening, it's probably indicative of some deeper problems,

988
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,780
so if you say keep it in, I say tell the person.

989
01:02:56,780 --> 01:03:00,940
On a cursory look, Ned was the Try Guy with it all, he had a stable and successful career,

990
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:05,140
a well connected network in multiple industries, a degree from a prolific university, he could

991
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:08,340
practically walk into any job and assume whatever role he wished.

992
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:12,200
At his core though, what completed him for many of his viewers, and the Try Guys fanbase

993
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,900
as a whole, was that family.

994
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:17,860
Ned chose to make his family part of the online world, to present himself as that devoted

995
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:22,200
husband and family man, he made that part of his brand, however, he also came across

996
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:26,520
as extremely competitive, very driven, and intense to a significant fault.

997
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:30,200
I think there are very few personalities that are more prone to becoming restless, yet as

998
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:33,500
the person with likely the most consistent and stable life of the members of the Try

999
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,120
Guys, there did seem to be a contradiction of existence.

1000
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:40,380
In spite of this, you never received the impression that this was a problem, even during the times

1001
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:43,580
when fans found the cheating was occurring, he continued to talk about these matters like

1002
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:44,580
he was on top of them.

1003
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:45,580
Ned- Happy date night.

1004
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:49,220
Jen- This is gonna be great, I think we did a really good job, and whatever happens.

1005
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:50,220
Ned- Whatever happens.

1006
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:51,220
Jen- I love you.

1007
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:52,220
Ned- We're in it together.

1008
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:53,220
I love you too.

1009
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:57,980
The fans Ned weaved an intricate web of deceit, he continued to profit off an image that simply

1010
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:02,860
was not the case, and all while his wife maintained this on the Try Guys channels as well, there

1011
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:06,980
was something so shameless about his actions, and ultimately what they culminated in, that

1012
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:10,860
caused a lot of anger amongst people who thought they knew him better, the Try Guys

1013
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:11,860
included.

1014
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:16,180
I think that perceived privilege combined with his actions likely made his behaviour,

1015
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:19,700
although not heinous on a standalone basis, rather insulting to all affected.

1016
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:24,300
Further to this, there was a very stark contrast between Ned and the rest of the Try Guys reaction,

1017
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:28,180
whereas they wanted to be as thorough as possible with their audience, Ned provided very little

1018
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:31,780
information, merely stating that he would be taking time off to focus on his family.

1019
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:35,340
It appeared to many to be a somewhat callous statement that didn't necessarily recognise

1020
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:38,500
the damage it had done to those involved, even though it was probably the best thing

1021
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:42,100
he could commit to doing, for many it felt like he was saving face.

1022
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:45,940
From this moment on, it was very easy for people to characterise Ned as that villain

1023
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:49,780
with the information they had available, and to reflect on his actions as always actually

1024
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:53,900
demonstrating something negative, perceiving him as this malevolent character.

1025
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:57,980
Add to which is the mix, and he became a cartoonish caricature of the person he probably was,

1026
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:00,580
remembered for this singular incident and treated as such.

1027
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:03,980
All limp attempts to defend him through the media were theorised to be a result of his

1028
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:08,060
doing, his attempts to get back at the Try Guys, despite the fact that there was no real

1029
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:13,420
evidence that he was involved, and that these would be very futile responses anyway.

1030
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:18,060
A lot of people have almost used the Try Guys thorough dissociation from Ned Forman to justify

1031
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:21,500
that he must have been the worst of the worst, but I just think they were upset at Ned for

1032
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,900
being placed in that position, rather than thinking that he was actually scum of the

1033
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:25,900
earth.

1034
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:29,520
The downside of there being business involvement in their separation is that it did lose that

1035
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:33,700
human aspect, something that neither parties appear to want to talk about, in one of their

1036
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:38,220
2023 interviews, a journalist asks Keith and Zack whether they still have any contact with Ned,

1037
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:42,460
and the publicist interrupts to inform them that they cannot speak on that matter, and although it is

1038
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:47,220
not my place to hypothesise whether they do or they don't, I wouldn't be offended if they did,

1039
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:51,300
but I'm sure other people would be, which is why they'd rather leave it as an unknown quantity.

1040
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:56,700
After all, the one Try Guys associate who has publicly remained in his life has received flak for that decision.

1041
01:05:56,700 --> 01:06:01,620
As noted earlier, when the news broke that she hadn't girl bossed him out of his life, there was a significant

1042
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:06,180
cohort of internet marriage counsellors who wanted to put the blame on her, who implied that she was

1043
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:10,540
enabling his behaviour by not divorcing him, people who want to tell you that actually co-parenting

1044
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:14,900
isn't so bad, and she might as well take the plunge, that she was sending a bad message to the children

1045
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:20,020
by not holding him accountable. These arguments range from hilarious to rather insulting to a mother

1046
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:24,660
who has probably been put through a fair share of personal turmoil trying to navigate a crisis within marriage.

1047
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:29,460
Ariel former knows Ned better than any of us, and if she made the decision to stick with him and pursue

1048
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:33,660
happiness together, then I wish her the best with it. Just because you can't empathise with how she

1049
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:38,700
approaches it, doesn't mean she is objectively wrong. Accountability can come from a variety of avenues,

1050
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:43,100
it doesn't equate to ruining someone's life, and all the people trying to use the Try Guys to shame her

1051
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:46,740
for not doing that should maybe reflect on what the Try Guys said themselves.

1052
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:53,340
Ned- We also want to remind you that the internet has a tendency to be a lot harsher towards women than men,

1053
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:56,940
so please, we ask that you exercise kindness.

1054
01:06:57,060 --> 01:07:01,340
There is this Dunning-Kruger effect online where people just seem to assume that everything that happens

1055
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:06,300
publicly is exactly how it happened privately as well, that there's been no personal discussions about

1056
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:11,980
responsibility, no remorse, no understanding or resolution between any party, which is strange given how much

1057
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:17,580
confidentiality was emphasised by the Try Guys. Sure, Ned could have made a half hour video about how sorry

1058
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:22,660
he was, but would it have alleviated the situation? With all the intersections of public and private figures

1059
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:27,700
who were caught up in this web, the intense media interest, and the desire to actually not blow it out of proportion,

1060
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:32,900
I'm somewhat doubtful. If anything, the one thing Ned did right was walking away as quietly as possible

1061
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:37,380
and seemingly rebuilding that marriage out of the public spotlight, something that I would say family

1062
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:42,100
relationships shouldn't be subjected to in the first place. What Ned did was wrong, and there was inevitably

1063
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:47,260
upset and anger from those who actually cared about him and the person he presented himself as, those close

1064
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:52,060
to him, as well as those who could only watch over a screen. But for those talking about divorce, it already

1065
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:57,020
happened in a five minute video a year ago, and it looks like both sides received the settlement they were

1066
01:07:57,020 --> 01:08:02,380
looking for, and if you have a problem with that, then you have more of a problem than anyone actually involved.

1067
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:04,380
So let's wrap this up.

1068
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:24,260
I mean, they're like brothers, they drive me nuts sometimes, but I think we make amazing things.

1069
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:27,260
That's greater than the sum of its parts.

1070
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:32,780
And we've only been able to affect people in a positive way, because we are actually best friends.

1071
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:35,260
If we start fucking hating each other, then we should stop.

1072
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:39,900
I'd like to start this conclusion by once more pointing him towards the cosmopolitan interview that Ned did

1073
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:44,060
where he said he would move to Canada if he was ever cheated on. The other person who provided an answer

1074
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:48,860
in that interview was Try Guy Zack, who appeared to take a more nuanced view. If someone cheats on you early

1075
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:53,420
in a relationship, that's typically a deal breaker, because it could be a sign of more strife to come,

1076
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:57,820
but it's good to hear someone else, what was the circumstance, did they get caught or admit it with remorse,

1077
01:08:57,820 --> 01:09:03,020
and do you believe it's an isolated incident? If you haven't had the exclusive talk yet, it could be a good way

1078
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:07,820
to open a necessary conversation to make sure both of you are on the same page, it's all about communication

1079
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:13,660
and making sure you're on the same page. Or I think it is, I'm single, so what do I know?

1080
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:18,220
Well, Zack appeared to know more than Ned, and ultimately Ned should be very grateful that his wife

1081
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:22,860
appeared to align more with Mr. Kornfeld's point of view, that there was something worth saving,

1082
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:27,020
but maybe there was something worth saving for everyone, they all just needed reminding of it.

1083
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:30,700
And then I started to see that the Try Guys was becoming something else, that the Try Guys was

1084
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:37,260
rigid and incapable of change, and that any attempt that I had to push against that

1085
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:40,620
wasn't going to work.

1086
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:44,700
When four men in an office decided to put on women's underwear, it would have been difficult to predict

1087
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:48,780
what it would lead to, yet over the span of eight years, the Try Guys had built their reputation as

1088
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:52,860
one of the most stable and consistent YouTube collectives with a clear and unwavering mission.

1089
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:57,660
Whilst other groups came and went with overwhelming transients often pulled apart by individual interests,

1090
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:02,620
Keith, Zack, Eugene, and Ned perfected a maturing chemistry that allowed them to grow as the quartet

1091
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:07,100
that many people perceived them as, acquiring more independence while maintaining a forward momentum.

1092
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:10,700
However, even the strongest partnerships can be subject to their own tribulations,

1093
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:13,820
and behind the scenes restlessness appeared to be brewing amongst the members,

1094
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:15,980
yet few could have foreseen what it would culminate in.

1095
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:20,380
You and your wife seem like you have such a great relationship, and it's kind of like an internet joke

1096
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:25,340
how much you talk about your wife, you always bring her up in conversations and things like that,

1097
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:28,860
so tell us, like, what's your number one secret to a great relationship?

1098
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:32,540
Oh gosh.

1099
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:37,020
Ned, the man who was perceived as the Try Guy who put his family and those close to him above all else,

1100
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:41,420
designed that a months long workplace affair was the answer to whatever difficulties he was encountering.

1101
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:45,340
In that decision, he not only acted counter to what the Try Guys felt they represented,

1102
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:47,580
but also what he represented himself as.

1103
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:50,700
In a way, although there were many worse things one could do in a workplace,

1104
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:54,060
there weren't many that felt more contradictory to what they had crafted.

1105
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:58,220
He fell short of what they expected of him, not just as a Try Guy, but as a husband.

1106
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:00,540
With that in mind, the Try Guys felt they had to act.

1107
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:05,420
There was no easy decision, if they were to operate by the book of how to handle these situations,

1108
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:06,780
then they had to let him go.

1109
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:08,860
At the same time, he was a close friend to all,

1110
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:12,780
and the Try Guys would be irreparably changed in enacting that protocol.

1111
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:15,740
In the end, it was a decision they took, but at what cost?

1112
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:21,180
After a month and a half, I cracked, and I texted this to Keith and Eugene,

1113
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:27,340
it's like, there's so much that we can't talk about, and can't say,

1114
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:32,380
and I can't tell, like, you know, people are like, oh, even fucking SNL is like,

1115
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:34,140
oh, his bro had a little smooch.

1116
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:40,140
And I'm like, that's not what fucking, okay, fine, I'm just gonna keep it clamped down,

1117
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:43,420
I'm just gonna not say anything, I'm gonna do it right, I'm just gonna do things right.

1118
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:47,340
Well, in the following weeks, they were subject to a list of speculation about their own knowledge,

1119
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:50,860
the proportionality of their punishment, and opinions from people who do not,

1120
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:52,220
and will never know them.

1121
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:55,740
Purposely distancing yourself from a long term friend can be an extremely challenging

1122
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:57,340
mental process for one to go through.

1123
01:11:57,340 --> 01:12:00,780
With all this attention on them for something they would have rather kept under wraps,

1124
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:03,580
it must have been easy to question whether they were making the right decision,

1125
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:07,820
yet in time, it became apparent to them that maybe this was what they needed to move forward.

1126
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:11,820
When a controversy affects a group with weak relationships and weak trust like Team 10,

1127
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:15,180
then it can often erode the faith and confidence remaining members may possess,

1128
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:18,700
but in the Try Guys case, it strengthened those bonds and those relationships because they all

1129
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:19,980
trusted that new route.

1130
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:23,740
If there was any sign that their decision was the right one, it's that Ned and Ariel are still

1131
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:28,220
together, but also the fact that the remaining Try Guys are still one unit is relevant as well.

1132
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:31,420
Judging by certain comments, it's a fact that may not have been the case if they

1133
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:35,260
hadn't been given a sharp wake up call from the unquestioned success of the past decade.

1134
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:41,180
And I think within that we're also taking it as an opportunity to wake up from this

1135
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:44,140
crazy wild ride that's been the Try Guys up to this point,

1136
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:47,900
to re-evaluate who we are and who we want to be going forward.

1137
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:50,940
The Try Guys may not be renowned for making heavy duty content,

1138
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:55,180
they may not be perceived as reaching the same artistic heights of other more ambitious creators,

1139
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:59,100
but there is a timelessness about the uploads that has survived numerous shifts in the YouTube

1140
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:04,060
ecosystem and retained a loyal fanbase who haven't disappeared as their content lost its virality.

1141
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:07,900
For all the provocative content one can find on YouTube, for all the shorts one can scroll

1142
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:11,420
through and lose hours to, there's an appeal to watching some dudes just fuck around with

1143
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:14,940
something they've never done before. That experience of approaching something unknown

1144
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:19,020
for the first time is transcendent, coming out wiser and stronger, knowing better for

1145
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:23,500
the next time and appreciating the experience. To the Try Guys, it seemed dealing with the

1146
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:27,420
Ned former scandal was just an extension of that, an abrupt if slightly challenging

1147
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:31,900
learning experience which cost them a member, but gained them a lot of perspective.

1148
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:35,580
What could have been the climax of their existence was just another chapter.

1149
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:39,420
A lot of interpretations of Keith, Eugene and Zach's handling of Ned seemed to create

1150
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:43,420
a much greater antagonist than the one that was actually present. The emotions that the Try Guys

1151
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:47,660
felt were weaponised to fulfil some twisted sense of justice and shard on Friday for the internet

1152
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:52,620
masses, however, I don't think they feel bitter about it or wish any further suffering from it.

1153
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:57,180
If anything, I think they cherish and value that 4 member era, Ned and many of the memories

1154
01:13:57,180 --> 01:14:01,180
they created with him, and that saying goodbye to their former colleague, hard as it was,

1155
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:02,940
doesn't have to undermine those memories.

1156
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:22,060
Ned himself had something else to say, whether he truly appreciated that at the time or not,

1157
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:26,620
the former family needed to come first. For ages they'd been part of that Try Guy network

1158
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:31,100
and become taken for granted like a brand. His facade becomes so comfortable that he wore it

1159
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:34,700
in front of the ones he loved, and with the tearing away of their masquerade, he may have

1160
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:40,140
needed to confront some uncomfortable truths. If they can emerge together from that, I'm happy for them.

1161
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:44,620
Ned former and the Try Guys made YouTube history together, they reached milestones and created

1162
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:49,420
memories that will never be erased, and although their belated honeymoon era came to a very sudden

1163
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:53,020
end, their story didn't, and that was a testament to something greater.

1164
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:57,740
A statement that maybe the Try Guys weren't quite finished trying yet.

1165
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:11,740
And that means that we can fight and get over it. So hopefully we're brothers.

1166
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:24,060
Thank you for watching.

1167
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:46,140
So that was the video, I hope you enjoyed. I want to give a big thanks to my editors,

1168
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:51,020
as always, they've done a great job. My post editor, Kojak, thank you very much for your

1169
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:56,220
unwavering commitment to this role. The music done by John Redhunter, thank you again,

1170
01:15:56,220 --> 01:16:00,940
it's sincerely appreciated, and the thumbnail produced by Starfo, another stellar piece,

1171
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:05,740
I am sure. I also want to credit the artists who've, as always, very generously lent their

1172
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:10,060
pieces towards being used in this content, it means a lot to me, and their credits will be

1173
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:13,980
in the description below, and as said in my previous video, I'm working on a new system where

1174
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:18,300
hopefully they'll be able to have the little sprites up as well, so you can all see their

1175
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:22,780
distinctive style. I also want to give a big thanks to my Patrons, $10 Patrons on screen right

1176
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:29,260
now, and my $50 Patrons, Hypercube, Esther Bedoya, and Seritish, thank you very much.

1177
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:34,860
At some point I need to sort out these YouTube member benefits as well, but that's not quite

1178
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:38,940
the top of the priority list right now. I'd also like to thank Incogny for sponsoring this video,

1179
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:43,580
thank you again, it's been a pleasure to work with you as always, and definitely check their

1180
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:47,740
application out, I dig it for sure. I don't know if I have too much else to say,

1181
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:52,860
it's getting cold up here, it's getting cold towards the winter, and I don't want to record

1182
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:57,420
too much beyond my capacity before I get chilly, so I'll leave you here for now,

1183
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:01,340
all I'll say is that I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you in the next one.
