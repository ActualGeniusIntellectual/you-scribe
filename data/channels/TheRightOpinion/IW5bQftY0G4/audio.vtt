WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:17.880
Hey guys, y'all know your address is online right?

00:17.880 --> 00:18.880
Huh?

00:18.880 --> 00:21.200
I just looked it up.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.240
And why did you do that?

00:23.240 --> 00:28.300
Haha yeah, so if you're in the US there are these sites where you can literally just find

00:28.300 --> 00:30.180
people's information.

00:30.180 --> 00:32.100
We aren't even in the US.

00:32.100 --> 00:35.500
Haha yeah, we are now.

00:35.500 --> 00:40.440
So you popped up to tell us our address is out there and that there is nothing we can

00:40.440 --> 00:41.440
do about it.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.660
You can do something about it.

00:43.660 --> 00:46.160
It just comes at a price.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.180
A fairly reasonable one actually.

00:48.180 --> 00:51.200
It's called Incognite, the sponsor of today's video.

00:51.200 --> 00:52.500
Has this ever happened to you?

00:52.500 --> 00:55.680
It's Friday night, you're sitting at home alone as always.

00:55.680 --> 00:58.800
It's been three weeks since you've had contact with another human being.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.080
A miracle happens.

01:00.080 --> 01:01.300
Your phone is ringing.

01:01.300 --> 01:02.560
It's a random number.

01:02.560 --> 01:05.200
This is the most excitement you've had in months.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.200
You pick it up.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.200
Hello?

01:07.200 --> 01:08.200
John speaking, you say.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.200
A voice answers back.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.200
Hello, we've been trying to reach you about your car's extended warranty.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.200
It's a remote call again.

01:11.200 --> 01:17.560
How do they keep getting my number I hear you ask?

01:17.560 --> 01:22.920
Companies known as data brokers collect your information and sell it onto whoever will

01:22.920 --> 01:23.960
pay.

01:23.960 --> 01:28.400
There are hundreds of data brokers making it difficult to fight them on your own.

01:28.400 --> 01:33.480
Incognite will automatically contact them on your behalf to issue takedown requests

01:33.480 --> 01:36.480
for your data so you don't have to.

01:36.480 --> 01:38.920
If we subscribe to Incognite, will you leave?

01:38.920 --> 01:39.920
Yeah.

01:39.920 --> 01:40.920
Okay, great.

01:40.920 --> 01:43.580
Um, Harley, can you go get my wallet?

01:43.580 --> 01:47.640
The first 100 people to use Code Opinion or click the link in the description box below

01:47.640 --> 01:52.060
will get 60% off Incognite and they have a 30 day money back guarantee as well.

01:52.060 --> 01:54.060
So be sure to check it out.

01:54.060 --> 02:03.140
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

02:03.140 --> 02:04.140
too much free time.

02:04.140 --> 02:09.540
And last video I covered the bombastic yet short lived YouTube collective of Team 10.

02:09.540 --> 02:21.700
If you want more on that video, you can go and watch it.

02:21.700 --> 02:24.620
But ultimately their undoing was the lack of permanence they could find within their

02:24.620 --> 02:28.300
members, which was exacerbated by an immature leader who drove people away, sacrificed his

02:28.300 --> 02:31.820
business credibility, and served as a magnet for all sorts of drama.

02:31.820 --> 02:35.740
Team 10 is an example of something that seemed bound to fall apart at any moment, he managed

02:35.740 --> 02:39.260
to leave an imprint on the YouTube landscape all the same, a pair of handprints in the

02:39.260 --> 02:40.580
cement before it set.

02:40.580 --> 02:43.980
However, Jake Paul's Omnium Gather'em isn't the only YouTube ensemble over the

02:43.980 --> 02:47.340
years to disband, as a matter of fact many more successful and long-running groups have

02:47.340 --> 02:59.340
found themselves at the end of their lifespan for a plethora of reasons.

02:59.340 --> 03:03.200
I'd say one of the most common reasons being that in many circumstances, the average age

03:03.200 --> 03:06.420
of many creators on YouTube skews towards a much younger mean, and if you're under

03:06.420 --> 03:10.660
the age of 25 or even 30, you're going to go through significant changes as an individual

03:10.660 --> 03:12.440
who wants to find their purpose in life.

03:12.440 --> 03:16.140
As a creator, you can evolve on your own terms, but when you have a designated role in a group,

03:16.140 --> 03:20.220
the expectations imposed on you can be suffocating, and may well test your commitment to people

03:20.220 --> 03:22.740
who do not necessarily share the same dreams that you do.

03:22.740 --> 03:25.420
Being part of a group can often really limit your development as an individual, and may

03:25.420 --> 03:28.540
also not give you the sort of compensation that you feel is appropriate for someone of

03:28.540 --> 03:31.620
your ability, you want to go out into the world and fulfil your potential before you

03:31.620 --> 03:32.620
settle down.

03:32.620 --> 03:36.460
When people grow, they can often grow apart, however not every group feels an expectation

03:36.460 --> 03:44.680
for eternal development, especially outside of YouTube.

03:44.680 --> 03:48.860
This is Buzzfeed, an internet media website founded in 2016 with the goal of arbitrating

03:48.860 --> 03:51.400
and disseminating online news through the use of algorithms.

03:51.400 --> 03:55.040
Over the years, they expanded their project and began to hire personnel to actually publish

03:55.040 --> 03:57.400
stories and add a face to their public image.

03:57.400 --> 04:00.480
Buzzfeed has received a lot of criticism in its time, and it's become a bit of a sacrificial

04:00.480 --> 04:04.280
lamb for the lampooning of millennial-based news, and it's purported vapidity.

04:04.280 --> 04:08.200
Nonetheless, it also became extremely successful, and blossomed as social media platforms took

04:08.200 --> 04:11.960
a grasp on internet climate, particularly on YouTube where algorithmic-based marketing

04:11.960 --> 04:15.360
was king, and multiple channels were set up under the Buzzfeed name to reach as many

04:15.360 --> 04:17.000
target demographics as possible.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.740
In spite of Buzzfeed's success, YouTube also brought many new challenges regarding

04:20.740 --> 04:25.080
creator-audience relationships, many of which felt like they had to be rooted in some form

04:25.080 --> 04:29.360
of personality, and although Buzzfeed's topics drew viewers and platformed individuals,

04:29.360 --> 04:32.340
their attention likely struggled while they tried to find a way to bridge the gap between

04:32.340 --> 04:34.080
themselves and the average YouTube viewer.

04:34.080 --> 04:38.200
Amongst this quandary, four unlikely heroes appeared, by the names of Eugene Lee Yang,

04:38.200 --> 04:40.880
Ned Fulmer, Keith Habersberger, and Zach Kornfeld.

04:40.880 --> 04:44.720
They were all Buzzfeed employees at the time who, as the only male employees prepared to,

04:44.720 --> 04:46.920
decided to create a video where they tried ladies' underwear.

04:46.920 --> 04:50.280
The result was somewhat unsurprising, but nonetheless interesting for people who wished

04:50.280 --> 04:52.760
to observe such a scenario, and men trying it.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.920
Buzzfeed had previously been experimenting with content that featured individuals trying

04:55.920 --> 04:59.240
a new experience, but this one was the first one to really stick the landing.

04:59.240 --> 05:03.200
There's no way for me to wear these without something popping out.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.840
Maybe if I tuck it up.

05:04.840 --> 05:06.840
This is why girls are always picking it out of things.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.840
As individuals, the Try Guys weren't your typical YouTube assemblage.

05:09.840 --> 05:13.360
They didn't start a channel together, nor were they previously overwhelmingly successful

05:13.360 --> 05:14.360
online.

05:14.360 --> 05:17.360
In fact, they didn't even intend to create content as a dedicated group when they started,

05:17.360 --> 05:20.760
with their only other prominent credits being other content on their employer's channel.

05:20.760 --> 05:23.720
But their video was well received, and in the spirit of Buzzfeed, they decided to get

05:23.720 --> 05:26.000
to work to creating more content in that vein.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.840
It wasn't until a few videos in which they actually adopted the Try Guys branding that

05:29.840 --> 05:33.580
they are known for today, alongside a mantra that they were prepared to try anything and

05:33.580 --> 05:34.580
everything.

05:35.300 --> 05:39.660
I think with everything that we do, we try to show that there is no one right way to

05:39.660 --> 05:44.700
be a man, to be a person, and yeah, you can still be tiny and delicate and cute and still

05:44.700 --> 05:45.700
be awesome.

05:45.700 --> 05:49.300
Given the unlikely story behind their formation, it seemed even more unlikely that this quartet

05:49.300 --> 05:53.180
would be able to survive each other, let alone the ever-changing environment around them.

05:53.180 --> 05:56.340
And yet over the years, they not only survived, but moved from strength to strength, growing

05:56.340 --> 05:59.980
a significant fanbase, winning multiple awards, publishing a best-selling book, acquiring

05:59.980 --> 06:02.700
their own YouTube Red series, and launching countless spin-offs.

06:02.700 --> 06:06.100
With the audience established, and their image untarnished, the only significant breakup

06:06.100 --> 06:09.340
occurred being their collective departure from Buzzfeed to launch their own independent

06:09.340 --> 06:13.780
production company, Second Try LLC, in which they have hosted their main, and a variety

06:13.780 --> 06:14.780
of other series out of.

06:14.780 --> 06:18.980
The decision to go solo together also lended a lot more creative freedom for each of the

06:18.980 --> 06:22.660
members to express themselves, the most notable example of this being Eugene's coming out

06:22.660 --> 06:25.300
video that is amongst one of their channel's most viewed.

06:25.300 --> 06:28.420
The Try Guys' apparent success as creators was rooted in that simple idea that they had

06:28.420 --> 06:32.380
founded themselves on, it didn't seem particularly revolutionary, but is often underscored by

06:32.380 --> 06:35.940
the timeless social message of finding out what it was like to walk in someone else's

06:35.940 --> 06:36.940
shoes.

06:36.940 --> 06:39.740
Their successes, colleagues, and friends, though, came down to something different.

06:39.740 --> 06:43.980
As people who didn't expect at every attempt, as people who just wanted to try something,

06:43.980 --> 06:47.460
there was this common bond that drew them together, using their YouTube channel to strengthen

06:47.460 --> 06:48.740
their own friendships.

06:48.740 --> 06:52.100
Although certain members may possess different levels of influence outside the group, when

06:52.100 --> 06:55.340
the cameras rolled, you never received the impression that one member's ego outshone

06:55.340 --> 06:56.340
the others.

06:56.340 --> 07:00.860
However, come 2022, something would happen that would place the message promoted in their

07:00.860 --> 07:05.340
interviews and their channel under question, and ultimately cause irreversible change to

07:05.340 --> 07:10.020
one of the most seemingly consistent and omnipresent YouTube collectives in recent memory.

07:10.020 --> 07:12.980
Maybe there were some things that shouldn't be tried.

07:12.980 --> 07:16.760
Ned Fomer is no longer working with the Try Guys.

07:16.760 --> 07:22.580
So friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears as we delve into the trial of the

07:22.580 --> 07:37.940
Try Guys.

07:37.940 --> 07:41.280
As I informed you in my introduction, the Try Guys were comprised of four members upon

07:41.280 --> 07:44.460
its founding, and although none of them stood out from each other, the differences in their

07:44.460 --> 08:07.160
personalities were essential to the sore play that occurred on camera.

08:07.160 --> 08:10.820
You add Zack, who is the energetic, slightly mischievous one, Keith who has a warmer, more

08:10.820 --> 08:14.620
traditional child about him, and also enjoys some good fried chicken, and then you have

08:14.620 --> 08:18.940
Eugene, who is more biting and sardonic but still possesses a unique amount of depth,

08:18.940 --> 08:36.660
and then you have Ned, the straight shooting family man.

08:36.660 --> 08:39.940
A chemistry graduate from Yale, Ned Fomer wouldn't strike you as your stereotypical

08:39.940 --> 08:43.920
media savvy individual, but his extracurricular activity would soon give you an impression

08:43.920 --> 08:48.140
of what he was capable of.

08:48.140 --> 08:54.260
A decorated comedy writer and performer in his circuit, Fomer already had his fair share

08:54.260 --> 08:57.980
of experience under his belt when he was picked up by Buzzfeed as an intern, and he quickly

08:57.980 --> 09:01.460
used that expertise to ascend the ranks to managing producer in the space of a year,

09:01.460 --> 09:05.260
alongside founding Buzzfeed's video department with his future fellow Try Guys co-hosts.

09:05.260 --> 09:09.240
However, there was more to Ned than just his career in comedy, it seems that his degree

09:09.240 --> 09:13.320
was not the only thing that he had chemistry with. Yes, even in early videos, there appeared

09:13.320 --> 09:24.560
to be a ring on his finger, signifying that Ned Fomer was a married man.

09:24.560 --> 09:28.880
His wife was a person by the birth name Aria Wundervord, she had met him at a mutual friend's

09:28.880 --> 09:33.040
birthday partly shortly after they had moved to Chicago, and they soon fell head over heels

09:33.040 --> 09:37.640
for each other. In 2012, at the age of 25, Ned officially tied the knot with Ariel, and

09:37.640 --> 09:41.480
settled down to the married couple's life. Unlike a lot of online personalities, Ned

09:41.480 --> 09:44.840
made no secret of his marriage, and would readily talk about his relationship on the

09:44.840 --> 09:48.860
Try Guys channel, garnering the reputation of the family man, who would readily bend

09:48.860 --> 09:50.960
over backwards for his lifelong companion.

09:50.960 --> 10:02.480
At first, the Try Guys content really only involved the four of them, with the establish

10:02.480 --> 10:06.080
of their own production company and the progression of their personal lives of other members,

10:06.080 --> 10:09.360
Aria and her partners found themselves more entangled in the crew's capers, especially

10:09.360 --> 10:13.680
with the launch of the Tri-Wife series, which features herself, Zach's girlfriend Maggie,

10:13.680 --> 10:14.880
and Keith's wife Becky.

10:14.880 --> 10:36.020
However, the Tri-Wife wasn't the only person in Ned's life, and since being where

10:36.020 --> 10:40.140
they had welcomed two children into the world. Once again, Ned was extremely proud to proclaim

10:40.140 --> 10:43.560
this, with multiple posts on social media and uploads onto YouTube, even launching a

10:43.560 --> 10:47.540
podcast with Ariel called Baby Steps, which discussed their experience with pregnancy

10:47.540 --> 11:10.300
and parenting. Ned often presented himself as a voice of authority on successful relationships

11:10.300 --> 11:13.860
and how to navigate them, hence the podcast. This was particularly important in the Try

11:13.860 --> 11:17.660
Guys post Buzzfeed era, which sought to find a sense of depth with each of the members.

11:17.660 --> 11:22.060
That was Ned's depth, but he always put his family first, and possessed very few reservations

11:22.060 --> 11:25.980
about it. His relationship with the Try Guys was also defined by this, and references to

11:25.980 --> 11:29.700
his family and content was frequently and seemingly central to the tasks at hand. I

11:29.700 --> 11:33.460
think what made Ned unique in a way was the sense of completion with his personal life,

11:33.460 --> 11:37.260
it provided a metaphorical anchor to what the Try Guys were orchestrating. Every Try

11:37.260 --> 11:41.820
Guy had something to try, but Ned had something to keep, and he appeared committed to doing

11:41.820 --> 11:42.820
so.

11:42.820 --> 11:47.280
In 2022, the Try Guys series had been in operation for nearly 8 years, and everything seemed

11:47.280 --> 11:50.900
pretty settled. Sure, they weren't pulling the significant viewing numbers they did at

11:50.900 --> 11:54.660
the peak of their popularity, but they seemed to understand that and already sought to diversify

11:54.660 --> 11:58.420
their revenue streams, with everything from a clothing line to a chicken sauce. The Try

11:58.420 --> 12:02.140
Guys appeared to have navigated the challenge of outgrowing each other by unshackling themselves

12:02.140 --> 12:05.900
from any constraints, and having an equal power share with their new company. That was

12:05.900 --> 12:09.480
a gesture of trust that could not be ignored. Outside of the new relationship they sought

12:09.480 --> 12:12.920
to craft their audience, there was also a new business side to their operations, and

12:12.920 --> 12:16.280
this incurred a new sense of responsibility on each of the members, who all hailed the

12:16.280 --> 12:20.880
title of Executive Producer at Second Try LLC. They all own shared and recruited a full

12:20.880 --> 12:24.880
team of employees, something that is never a straightforward process. Nevertheless, in

12:24.880 --> 12:27.940
interviews, what claimed matter most of them was that they were in control of their careers

12:27.940 --> 12:31.960
and their images, something that they were never able to completely fulfil while working

12:31.960 --> 12:35.840
under Buzzfeed. They were the masters of their own destiny.

12:35.840 --> 12:38.880
The thrill of being able to operate your own company and not having to answer to anyone

12:38.920 --> 12:42.760
is pretty unmatched. It allowed each Try Guy to pursue their own personal and group interests

12:42.760 --> 12:46.240
without the constraints of a parent company, or even a reliance on a singular platform.

12:46.240 --> 12:49.840
At the same time, there are a lot of external pressures that being your own boss may impose

12:49.840 --> 12:53.960
on you. The Try Guys had to navigate them, and required the input of all members to do

12:53.960 --> 12:57.760
so, but for years running their own business and everything appeared to be going swimmingly,

12:57.760 --> 13:01.080
until some keen observers began to spot the absence of one of their members.

13:02.080 --> 13:07.080
Hands up, bakers! Nailed it! I'm f***ing crushed here, guys.

13:07.080 --> 13:09.480
Where could our resident family man be?

13:22.480 --> 13:26.440
The Try Guys have a pretty consistent upload schedule and motif in general, so devoted

13:26.440 --> 13:30.280
fans were normally quite quick to pick up if something was different or something has

13:30.280 --> 13:33.440
changed, particularly if a member is absent from the videos. When Eugene took a break

13:33.440 --> 13:37.320
in 2021 from the Try Guys, people were fast to pick up on it, and explained it to other

13:37.320 --> 13:41.680
confused viewers. So in September 2022, when a video was published onto the Try Guys channel

13:41.680 --> 13:45.600
without founding member Ned Former, although nobody raised an alarm, people definitely

13:45.600 --> 13:48.320
took notice, particularly with what some knew already.

13:48.320 --> 14:02.120
It all started on the first of the month, when a fan ran into Ned at New York City,

14:02.120 --> 14:06.120
while he was with a producer at a concert. They posted a pitch with Ned, but not the

14:06.120 --> 14:09.280
producer, and noted that they seemed annoyed that they were recognised. It was soon revealed

14:09.280 --> 14:12.200
there were other people from the production team at the concert, and therefore nothing

14:12.200 --> 14:16.040
seemed particularly out of the ordinary. However, less than a couple days after, other posts

14:16.040 --> 14:19.720
appeared to indicate that something untoward was occurring, with images shared that showed

14:19.720 --> 14:24.120
a person appearing to be Ned making out with this aforementioned producer. The account

14:24.120 --> 14:27.340
sharing many of these details later claimed in the messages that they were the producers

14:27.340 --> 14:31.160
then fiance. Certainly a curious piece of information to share, and it seemed a bit

14:31.160 --> 14:35.240
bizarre that they would take to Reddit over it, but fans compared and included that physical

14:35.240 --> 14:40.100
profiles matched up with the individuals suggested. With that noted, there was probably more concern

14:40.100 --> 14:44.080
than usual when Ned ceased to appear on the Try Guys videos in their podcast. This was

14:44.080 --> 14:47.680
clearly something unforeseen at least, although a variety of explanations were still on the

14:47.680 --> 14:51.120
table, and it was possible that the Try Guys were merely taking precautionary measures

14:51.120 --> 14:54.440
while investigating the claims more thoroughly. Although no public statements were released

14:54.440 --> 14:58.480
in this time, the Try Guys schedule was visibly disrupted, with apologies being posted onto

14:58.480 --> 15:02.160
their Patreon, with Zant letting slip that he wasn't doing so great in a podcast episode.

15:02.160 --> 15:09.440
Zant- When I tell you that, I've had a rough week, and this has been such a salve.

15:10.280 --> 15:13.800
This was all circumstantial and hearsay though, with a plethora of potential explanations

15:13.800 --> 15:17.640
for why this was the case. Over time though, further information began to indicate that

15:17.640 --> 15:21.520
this was something being taken a little more permanently. On the Try Guys channel, Ned

15:21.520 --> 15:25.480
was being edited out of the intro featuring new merch, and some eagle eyed viewers began

15:25.480 --> 15:29.280
to pick up on slight discrepancies in videos, including points where it appeared to have

15:29.280 --> 15:32.760
been edited out of recorded footage. This didn't seem like the sort of decisions where

15:32.760 --> 15:36.820
a person was merely on an optional hiatus, this appeared to be a preparation for something

15:36.820 --> 15:41.540
much, much worse. And on September the 26th, the rumours that Ned Fulmer had boldly tried

15:41.540 --> 15:45.540
an affair with a co-worker while in a committed marriage began to make the rounds outside

15:45.540 --> 15:49.780
of dedicated fan circles, with more people weighing in online and analysing the content

15:49.780 --> 15:54.500
available. In addition, a former Second Try employee who had recently left posted a TikTok

15:54.500 --> 15:56.140
that appeared to confirm the rumours.

15:56.140 --> 16:02.420
Zant- You ruined everything, you stupid bitch.

16:02.420 --> 16:06.260
At this stage, nothing had been certified by the party, but everything appeared to be

16:06.260 --> 16:10.140
adding up regarding his sudden airbrushing from the Try Guys content, and apprehending

16:10.140 --> 16:14.280
that the news was about to break, on the 27th of September, the Try Guys released a short

16:14.280 --> 16:18.140
statement on social media informing all that an internal review had been conducted and

16:18.140 --> 16:21.620
that Ned had been removed from the Try Guys roster, as they did not see a way forward

16:21.620 --> 16:25.140
with him. The same day, Ned released a statement onto Twitter and Instagram which confirmed

16:25.140 --> 16:28.560
the rumours regarding the reason behind this. He states that family should have been his

16:28.560 --> 16:33.340
priority but he ultimately lost focus and partook in a consensual, I'd hope so, workplace

16:33.340 --> 16:37.260
relationship. He apologises for any pain that he has caused to everyone affected, especially

16:37.260 --> 16:40.900
Ariel who he pledges commitment following the scandal. This statement in particular

16:40.900 --> 16:44.780
was not well received, and many people proceeded to dunk on him, even starting a meme trend

16:44.780 --> 16:48.820
where Ned's selectively used letters from his statement to create a new comment or message,

16:48.820 --> 16:52.380
so at least something creative came out of it. It is a bit of a strange statement, every

16:52.380 --> 16:55.540
word seems rather contrived, and although I'm sure people are pleased that it was

16:55.540 --> 16:59.580
a consensual relationship, I don't think they were assuming otherwise, so Ned's phrasing

16:59.580 --> 17:02.420
seems strangely defensive in light of that.

17:02.420 --> 17:05.500
Ariel also released a statement onto Instagram thanking those who had reached out to her

17:05.500 --> 17:08.900
but requesting privacy for the sake of her children, emphasizing that nothing was more

17:08.900 --> 17:12.900
important to the couple. In the space of a day, all directly involved parties with a

17:12.900 --> 17:16.660
public presence had released their own statements, amplifying the story significantly, and on

17:16.660 --> 17:19.740
hand to further share the story was the ever reliable media.

17:19.740 --> 17:23.500
If you're on any form of social media, then by now you must have heard of the huge scandal

17:23.500 --> 17:24.940
involving Ned from the Try Guys.

17:24.940 --> 17:28.180
Over the following week, a series of articles were published which reflected on the sudden

17:28.180 --> 17:32.540
revelations and people's responses to it, including ironically from Buzzfeed themselves.

17:32.540 --> 17:35.740
Some former co-workers appeared to react with indifference, implying that this news was

17:35.740 --> 17:40.780
not exactly surprising to them. As expected, analysis of past content began as well, including

17:40.780 --> 17:44.360
an interview where Ned states that if he was ever cheated on he'd probably moved to Canada,

17:44.360 --> 17:47.540
and that it was the ultimate deal breaker in a relationship, alongside other claims

17:47.540 --> 17:51.260
he had made advances elsewhere. Questions were asked about how long this had gone on

17:51.260 --> 17:55.020
for, whether there were more people, with the sorts of reactions coming from any sources,

17:55.020 --> 17:58.460
this sort of hypothesis was rife amongst internet communities. It was clearly blowing

17:58.460 --> 18:01.700
up faster than anticipated, and questions were beginning to circulate regarding the

18:01.700 --> 18:05.220
Try Guys' own knowledge of the matter, and their potential complicity in a cover-up

18:05.220 --> 18:09.740
of this workplace affair. Such behaviour would be counter-intuitive to what their brand exemplified

18:09.740 --> 18:13.500
and could seriously affect their operations. By this point, the Try Guys had to disclose

18:13.500 --> 18:17.420
too much information outside of their statements, and people didn't necessarily have a right

18:17.420 --> 18:21.820
to speculate, but that's what people on the internet do, and without further information

18:21.820 --> 18:24.140
such theories were going to continue to churn away.

18:24.700 --> 18:29.980
Ned Fomer is no longer working with the Try Guys. By now, we're assuming you've seen

18:29.980 --> 18:34.460
the Reddit threads, and TikToks, and tweets, and news articles.

18:34.460 --> 18:36.060
They needed to clear the air.

18:41.060 --> 18:45.460
On October 3rd, the Try Guys released a video entitled What Happened? As one can likely

18:45.460 --> 18:48.680
predict, this is a video which attempts to clarify information that have been speculated

18:48.680 --> 18:53.660
about on a variety of media platforms by providing a linear chronological timeline of their handling

18:53.700 --> 18:57.340
of the suspension of their former colleague. The video has them sitting on a couch, directly

18:57.340 --> 19:01.020
facing the camera, and the information is delivered in a uniform manner, with each of

19:01.020 --> 19:04.660
the Try Guys taking turns to explain parts of the process, likely to emphasise that this

19:04.660 --> 19:06.060
was a collective decision.

19:06.060 --> 19:11.380
Throughout this video, there will be things that we want to say or go into further, but

19:11.380 --> 19:15.560
as I'm sure you're aware, there are some legal issues we have to consider as we go

19:15.560 --> 19:17.080
through everything.

19:17.080 --> 19:20.360
They state that they had been alerted to this information on Labor Day by fans who had seen

19:20.360 --> 19:23.740
Ned Forman engaging romantically with an employee of the company, and had confirmed

19:23.740 --> 19:26.920
these allegations and conceded that it had been going on for a while, which the Try Guys

19:26.920 --> 19:30.280
found rather surprising, affirming that they had no idea about this effect.

19:30.280 --> 19:34.440
All of that information was just as shocking to us as all of this has been for you this

19:34.440 --> 19:35.440
week.

19:35.440 --> 19:38.480
After this, they conducted a thorough three week internal review which would seek to ascertain

19:38.480 --> 19:42.160
all the facts of the situation, once again with Eugene stressing how serious the situation

19:42.160 --> 19:44.980
was to the rest of his team, and rebusting rumours that they may have turned a blind

19:44.980 --> 19:46.740
eye at any point.

19:46.740 --> 19:52.060
This is something we took very seriously.

19:52.060 --> 19:55.460
We refused to sweep things under the rug.

19:55.460 --> 19:59.140
That is not who we are, and it's not what we stand for.

19:59.140 --> 20:02.860
They state their process was not just internal, as they reassessed the media they released

20:02.860 --> 20:06.260
in that time, confirming rumours that they had been digitally removing Ned from their

20:06.260 --> 20:09.780
content, and omitting sections which involved him altogether, as well as stating there were

20:09.780 --> 20:12.020
certain videos that were too tainted for release.

20:12.020 --> 20:15.660
There are several videos that we've deemed as fully unreleasable, you will never see

20:15.660 --> 20:19.940
them, and that is due to his involvement, and that's a decision that has cost us lots

20:19.940 --> 20:20.940
of money.

20:20.940 --> 20:25.180
We will not be able to recoup that money, but it's a decision we stand by proudly.

20:25.180 --> 20:28.380
The review drew to a close with the conclusion that the only reasonable solution in this

20:28.380 --> 20:32.500
case was to ultimately remove Ned from the company as a manager and employee, something

20:32.500 --> 20:36.820
which the three remaining members did on September 16th, just over ten days before the story

20:36.820 --> 20:38.000
broke publicly.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.220
They arrived reasoning for not releasing a public statement immediately, wishing to protect

20:41.220 --> 20:46.100
the privacy of people involved, and avoiding causing additional stress onto affected parties.

20:46.100 --> 20:51.460
So on Friday, September 16th, the three of us signed written consent of the members of

20:51.460 --> 20:57.740
Second Try LLC approving the removal of Ned as a manager and employee, and while we consider

20:57.740 --> 21:03.420
this a company matter, there's just also a family at the centre of this.

21:03.420 --> 21:06.900
They then talk about the actual personal toll it's taken on them, and those around them,

21:06.900 --> 21:11.140
requesting respect and space for any people caught up in the blast radius of such a spectacle.

21:12.060 --> 21:17.140
Look, I get that when stuff like this happens, there's going to be speculation and gossip,

21:17.140 --> 21:21.320
and we ask that you respect the privacy of the family members and employees who may be

21:21.320 --> 21:22.320
caught up in this.

21:22.320 --> 21:26.060
There are a few more notes that I might save for later, but the general message is that

21:26.060 --> 21:29.100
they had no knowledge of this happening prior to fans communicating this with them, and

21:29.100 --> 21:32.300
that once they were informed, they acted as swiftly and efficiently as they could, and

21:32.300 --> 21:35.580
took an action that was obviously difficult for them, but they felt was necessary.

21:35.580 --> 21:38.500
They stand by their response, and intend to move forward after they have provided a more

21:38.500 --> 21:39.980
comprehensive statement.

21:39.980 --> 21:43.860
This finishes the video, which appears to be at least a response to end certain roots

21:43.860 --> 21:44.980
of speculation.

21:44.980 --> 21:48.620
All the Try Guys appear rather worn down in the release, with many noting Eugene's apparent

21:48.620 --> 21:53.060
anger, Keith's disgust, and Zack's upset, but all share this tone of clear annoyance

21:53.060 --> 21:55.180
that the situation had reached this stage.

21:55.180 --> 21:58.700
The response to this video was generally supportive from many viewers, particularly those who

21:58.700 --> 22:02.100
were fans of the Try Guys, felt that this was a respectful and in-depth response that

22:02.100 --> 22:03.300
dispelled the rumours.

22:03.300 --> 22:05.980
Although they don't necessarily provide any evidence for this video, the timeline

22:05.980 --> 22:08.800
made sense given the information available at that time.

22:08.800 --> 22:12.320
Anyone involved who did speak on the matter appeared to corroborate what the Try Guys

22:12.320 --> 22:13.320
said.

22:13.320 --> 22:16.100
Nonetheless, there were a couple interesting pieces of information that cropped up shortly

22:16.100 --> 22:17.300
after the video went live.

22:17.300 --> 22:19.640
When you knew Ned was cheating in May...

22:19.640 --> 22:39.720
The first was a TikTok posted on October 5th which allegedly showed Ned in a Burbank restaurant

22:39.720 --> 22:43.060
with his producer in May, confirming what the Try Guys said about this relationship

22:43.060 --> 22:44.420
occurring for a while.

22:44.420 --> 22:48.060
This also substantiates earlier images that had been taken around May time which featured

22:48.060 --> 22:49.060
the two together.

22:49.080 --> 22:52.400
The person who posted this claimed to have messaged Ariel about this interaction back

22:52.400 --> 22:54.040
then, but hadn't received a response.

22:54.040 --> 22:57.280
The producer's fiancé responds to this TikTok stating that he wished he'd been

22:57.280 --> 23:00.900
told, but given that TikTok unlikely didn't know the identity of the person Ned was seated

23:00.900 --> 23:02.900
with, it wouldn't have been possible.

23:02.900 --> 23:05.920
Not to soon after, a former Buzzfeed employee stated that they had personally had a large

23:05.920 --> 23:09.000
falling out with Ned a few years prior, and stated that people at the workplace would

23:09.000 --> 23:12.640
have a running joke that there were different Neds for different days, and he was notoriously

23:12.640 --> 23:16.640
duplicitous, though he was apparently shocked by the brazenness of his actions of recent,

23:16.660 --> 23:20.180
and implies that he expected more discretion from a hyper-competitive Yale graduate.

23:20.180 --> 23:23.100
Although none of this information appeared to contradict what the Try Guys had shared

23:23.100 --> 23:27.180
in their video, it did provide new angles to Ned and the history he held with his past

23:27.180 --> 23:28.180
companies.

23:28.180 --> 23:32.580
What we hope is that within this, there's also the opportunity for positive growth and

23:32.580 --> 23:36.340
better videos ahead, but it's going to be hard.

23:36.340 --> 23:38.820
This whole thing is going to be really fucking hard.

23:38.820 --> 23:42.260
Although their video did set the record straight and away, their rather serious tone, whether

23:42.260 --> 23:47.220
caused by fatigue or desire to show solidarity with affected parties, stressed gravitas and

23:47.220 --> 23:49.480
naturally drew the media back into the fray.

23:49.480 --> 23:52.840
In the next few days, many articles were published retelling the story of the Try Guys, and their

23:52.840 --> 23:53.840
present drama.

23:53.840 --> 23:57.160
Most of these stories didn't bring many new details to the table, but more served

23:57.160 --> 24:01.880
as an accessibility ramp for those not versed in the drama as it transpired.

24:01.880 --> 24:05.200
Emotions and tensions still remained somewhat high, stories were still coming from many

24:05.200 --> 24:09.180
high profile news websites, more publicity than many far more controversial individuals

24:09.180 --> 24:10.180
have received.

24:10.180 --> 24:13.740
There had to be some way to control the fever that appeared to grasp people, and their interest

24:13.740 --> 24:17.140
in a situation that the Try Guys would never have wanted in the first place.

24:17.140 --> 24:20.820
Well, they did mention in their video that they had a longer statement to release, and

24:20.820 --> 24:22.700
a few days after, they released it.

24:30.660 --> 24:33.660
The Try Guys were at a bit of a crossroads, there was clearly a lot of information they

24:33.660 --> 24:37.260
wanted to share their side on, but they also wanted to move past this torrent of media

24:37.260 --> 24:39.460
attention as soon as possible.

24:39.460 --> 24:42.300
They could wait for a bit for the coverage to die down, but then they'd potentially

24:42.300 --> 24:45.340
be prolonging the drama, and who was to know that it wouldn't just re-emerge as soon

24:45.340 --> 24:46.620
as they opened their mouths?

24:46.620 --> 24:50.500
They needed something conclusive that also didn't provide more questions than it answers.

24:50.500 --> 24:51.820
How are they going to do that?

24:51.820 --> 24:52.820
Well.

24:52.820 --> 24:57.380
We're four best friends who try stuff, we have a YouTube channel together, we happen

24:57.380 --> 25:02.120
to live particularly insane lives, especially right now, and so this podcast is a chance

25:02.120 --> 25:06.180
for us to hang out every week, talk, catch up, and just let you know what we're thinking

25:06.180 --> 25:07.180
about.

25:07.220 --> 25:10.700
One of the main adventures the Try Guys had embarked on upon leaving Buzzfeed was a podcast

25:10.700 --> 25:11.700
called The Tripod.

25:11.700 --> 25:15.340
At first, it involved all four members sitting down and talking about whatever was on their

25:15.340 --> 25:17.260
mind in a less contrived environment.

25:17.260 --> 25:21.220
Over time, though, Eugene appeared less, and three others appeared to take the reins, alongside

25:21.220 --> 25:22.760
podcast producer Miles.

25:22.760 --> 25:26.260
With Ned's unilateral withdrawal from the Try Guys and all affiliated media, there was

25:26.260 --> 25:30.100
going to be a readjustment required for the podcast format, which originally had him sitting

25:30.100 --> 25:31.100
next to Keith.

25:31.100 --> 25:35.300
However, the Try Guys also saw an opportunity to use this up people as a way to make a more

25:35.300 --> 25:36.300
official statement.

25:36.300 --> 25:40.080
I use official in quotation marks here, because it's probably one of the most unofficial

25:40.080 --> 25:43.900
official statements in recent corporate history, but it did kinda make sense.

25:43.900 --> 25:44.900
Ned- Shall we?

25:44.900 --> 25:45.900
Eugene- Go for it, man.

25:45.900 --> 25:46.900
Ned- Okay.

25:46.900 --> 25:47.900
Eugene- Well, here we are, everyone.

25:47.900 --> 25:52.460
Ned- Welcome to the Try Pod to all of our normal listeners and no new people whatsoever.

25:52.460 --> 25:55.320
When you first look at the video length of over an hour, you wouldn't be amiss for

25:55.320 --> 25:59.180
perhaps being a bit concerned that this may feel like overkill, however the runtime is

25:59.180 --> 26:02.780
aesthetically justified by a more relaxed environment that doesn't necessarily possess

26:02.780 --> 26:05.060
the tension their previous video statement did.

26:05.060 --> 26:09.060
As fans Eugene, Keith and Zack are provided emotional support from Mars, as they recount

26:09.060 --> 26:12.780
the incident to the process and go into more depth on their own feelings regarding it all.

26:12.780 --> 26:16.820
Keith- We knew that this would be big to our fans and people who had watched us in the

26:16.820 --> 26:20.180
past, but I had no idea it would be this.

26:20.180 --> 26:26.120
Zach- The New York Times, NPR, Rolling Stone, I mean these are publications that are huge

26:26.120 --> 26:30.580
and we never thought would be concerned with us, and now certainly some of them are, who

26:30.580 --> 26:37.140
are these guys and why does everyone care articles, but it showed that we had a really

26:37.140 --> 26:38.700
big effect on a lot of people.

26:38.700 --> 26:43.180
Keith- As we're talking, my family just sent me another Rolling Stone article that came

26:43.180 --> 26:44.180
out an hour ago.

26:44.180 --> 26:47.620
While the recurring themes from this video is that they really did not anticipate it

26:47.620 --> 26:51.260
blowing up in the way that it did, and although they always intended to sack him, if they'd

26:51.260 --> 26:54.580
had the choice, they would have done it a lot more quietly to avoid the sort of volatile

26:54.580 --> 26:58.340
public reaction that a lot of parties involved have received, something that has taken a

26:58.340 --> 26:59.340
toll on them all.

26:59.740 --> 27:02.420
Zach- Have you ever thought that stress does not manifest physically?

27:02.420 --> 27:11.300
Let me tell you, my back hurts, my BM's have been wild, the stress poops have been out

27:11.300 --> 27:18.100
of control, have not been sleeping, and part of that is because there's just been so much

27:18.100 --> 27:19.100
to do.

27:19.100 --> 27:22.740
They remained steadfast in the narrative regarding how much they knew, stating that being contacted

27:22.740 --> 27:26.340
by fans was the first time they had heard about it, and they moved as quickly as possible

27:26.340 --> 27:27.580
to form an internal review.

27:27.580 --> 27:31.260
A majority of the credit to handling this situation is given to Zach, who is the person

27:31.260 --> 27:35.180
said to have overseen the operation that led to the removal of Ned from Second Tryer LLC,

27:35.180 --> 27:36.880
given that Keith was on tour.

27:36.880 --> 27:40.100
They say the secrecy wasn't exclusive to the public, and they couldn't even disclose

27:40.100 --> 27:44.280
details of Ned's suspension to fellow employees, although they were pretty fast to deduce exactly

27:44.280 --> 27:45.420
what had occurred.

27:45.420 --> 27:48.940
With mind to the fact that this information had been uncovered by fans first, they intended

27:48.940 --> 27:52.440
to wait until speculation had passed before releasing a statement, which explains why

27:52.440 --> 27:54.700
they hadn't released one immediately upon Ned's dismissal.

27:54.700 --> 28:00.740
So to be clear, however this went down, we would have taken the same action.

28:00.740 --> 28:06.380
But the fact that it was something that was caught by fans, that it was a transgression

28:06.380 --> 28:11.540
that was enacted publicly, added a level of complication to this, where we knew there

28:11.540 --> 28:15.360
was this stick of dynamite with an uncertain fuse.

28:15.360 --> 28:21.520
You have to really have things in line to legally be able to say some things.

28:21.520 --> 28:26.560
And even then, also, you're not just doing things out of fear of legal action, you're

28:26.560 --> 28:32.080
doing things out of fear of public backlash to other parties involved.

28:32.080 --> 28:36.380
So you're really trying, like, I don't want people who are hurt to become more hurt,

28:36.380 --> 28:42.520
I don't want to do something wrong and get sued and further jeopardise the company and

28:42.520 --> 28:43.520
people's jobs.

28:43.520 --> 28:46.680
In the original video statement, they're afraid to make any character judgements towards

28:46.680 --> 28:47.680
their former colleague.

28:47.680 --> 28:51.280
In the podcast, they still play their cards relative close to their chest, but there are

28:51.280 --> 28:54.440
the occasional moments where they let some emotion surface, especially when clearing

28:54.440 --> 28:58.960
up speculation, there seems to be an air of disdain for Ned and his handling of the situation.

28:58.960 --> 29:06.240
No, we shared what our statement was going to be, we did not have insight into what his

29:06.240 --> 29:07.480
statement was.

29:07.480 --> 29:12.000
I also want to say that we did not coordinate fonts, I believe that he saw ours and copied

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
it.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
That is our opinion.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.680
And it is an opinion that I'm not happy about.

29:16.680 --> 29:24.360
When I saw that, I'm like, you got to choose the same font that made it look like we wrote

29:24.360 --> 29:25.360
your...

29:25.360 --> 29:28.960
It's my opinion that that was on purpose.

29:28.960 --> 29:33.760
That was too optimised result for him.

29:33.760 --> 29:34.760
That's my opinion.

29:34.760 --> 29:37.320
Additionally, there's an interesting clip towards the end where Keith begins to talk

29:37.320 --> 29:41.060
about the sentiment of betrayal, before Zach cuts it back to a more detached perspective

29:41.060 --> 29:42.360
of the matter.

29:42.360 --> 29:47.760
Keith, final one here is if this hadn't gone public, was there a world where Ned came back

29:47.760 --> 29:49.080
and was a cast member?

29:49.080 --> 29:50.080
No.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.080
No.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.080
Yeah.

29:52.080 --> 29:53.080
And maybe speak to why.

29:53.080 --> 29:54.080
No.

29:54.080 --> 29:59.620
Look, what happened, it betrayed our trust.

29:59.620 --> 30:01.160
And it was a workplace violation.

30:01.160 --> 30:03.160
It was a workplace violation.

30:03.160 --> 30:08.000
It would mean to all the people in our office who knew what they knew, they would know that

30:08.000 --> 30:12.960
we were in the face of everything like not being true to who we say we are in our values.

30:12.960 --> 30:15.440
So like, very simply, he would have been removed.

30:15.440 --> 30:18.560
There's a sense that even if they were to speak openly about their emotions, they're

30:18.560 --> 30:22.480
aware of the possible implications of riling up fans and viewers, some that they also speak

30:22.480 --> 30:26.240
about, emphasizing that people mess up and don't necessarily deserve death threats,

30:26.240 --> 30:28.800
although they do exclude Ned from this narrative.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.720
It's just like really, really scary.

30:30.720 --> 30:36.160
Like to get, you know, I'm sure that their DMs are full of crazy messages and just feel

30:36.160 --> 30:42.620
it's, it can make you feel really like no one in the world likes you anymore.

30:42.620 --> 30:43.620
And that can be hard.

30:43.620 --> 30:45.880
I know for a fact that people have received death threats because of this.

30:45.880 --> 30:52.040
I know that people, you know, their past has been dredged up and they, look, a bad thing

30:52.040 --> 30:56.560
happened and we reacted accordingly and did what we had to do.

30:56.560 --> 31:00.120
Actions have repercussions, but...

31:00.120 --> 31:02.360
It would be a lot for the strongest person to handle.

31:02.560 --> 31:06.640
As an episode of the podcast that seeks to find the balance between explaining the situation

31:06.640 --> 31:10.120
without provoking it, they seem to do a fair job, and they clear up some misconceptions,

31:10.120 --> 31:13.680
but there was one more matter they needed to discuss, which wasn't covered in their

31:13.680 --> 31:15.680
original response video.

31:15.680 --> 31:17.680
That being, what now?

31:17.680 --> 31:19.560
I don't know.

31:19.560 --> 31:27.040
I think if this didn't happen, there is a world in which the Try Guys cast, you know,

31:27.040 --> 31:29.960
like how do I want to say this?

31:30.240 --> 31:38.360
For the last two years, frankly, I've kind of personally gone through this mental process

31:38.360 --> 31:46.640
of acceptance, of realising that where I want to grow and what the Try Guys is are different.

31:46.640 --> 31:49.840
There have been a lot of speculations as to whether there would be a new Try Guy, including

31:49.840 --> 31:52.240
from the roster of people they currently collaborated with.

31:52.240 --> 31:55.240
Keith and Zack confirmed that this is not happening, and that the Try Guys that people

31:55.240 --> 31:58.840
had come to know would no longer exist, and although the situation had been exhausting

31:58.880 --> 32:02.920
and distressing, they did see an opportunity within the tragedy to move forward.

32:02.920 --> 32:06.520
Zack in particular expresses this idea that the Try Guys had become rather rigid, and

32:06.520 --> 32:09.200
incapable of the sort of growth that he desired from life.

32:09.200 --> 32:13.120
These circumstances, albeit unfortunate, allowed them to reassess how they wanted to develop

32:13.120 --> 32:15.240
as a collective and individuals.

32:15.240 --> 32:20.320
And sometimes like a good laugh is a relief and a piece of content that you need, but

32:20.320 --> 32:28.760
more and more we are going to allow the Try Guys to grow with us, to adapt as we adapt,

32:28.760 --> 32:34.000
and to bring in new creative people like Kwesi, like a myriad of people you know on

32:34.000 --> 32:38.680
this channel, and allow them that opportunity to make stuff that's deeply important to

32:38.680 --> 32:39.680
them.

32:39.680 --> 32:40.680
And that's that.

32:40.680 --> 32:44.000
It seems that the controversy in the subsequent coverage had tainted the Try Guys' name

32:44.000 --> 32:47.840
in their mind, and that was not easy for people who had built their brand around that, but

32:47.840 --> 32:51.720
maybe it had also been holding them back, and this was something, finally, that could

32:51.720 --> 32:52.720
propel them forward.

32:52.720 --> 33:03.000
The Try Guys' second statement appeared to satisfy most of social media and the mainstream

33:03.000 --> 33:06.400
media in explaining what transpired and their plans to move forward from it.

33:06.400 --> 33:09.840
It was good to have a response that grasped the scope of the situation while not necessarily

33:09.840 --> 33:11.860
dramatising or downplaying it.

33:11.860 --> 33:15.200
This seemed to be a good point for all to draw the line under the situation, but little

33:15.200 --> 33:17.480
did they know, the narrative was soon going to shift.

33:17.480 --> 33:22.280
It would not have been this public spectacle, we probably would have tried to avoid that

33:22.280 --> 33:27.200
for the sake of the other people involved, but it happened how it happened.

33:27.200 --> 33:30.680
At multiple points in the podcast, Keith and Zach's threats they did not expect, nor

33:30.680 --> 33:33.920
did they want the situation to blow up like it has, and they were very upset about the

33:33.920 --> 33:36.800
speculation and involvement from external parties.

33:36.800 --> 33:39.960
There was this sense that people needed to step back and remember that although this

33:39.960 --> 33:43.480
was obviously emotionally effective for some people, there also needed to be a sense of

33:43.480 --> 33:44.480
perspective.

33:44.480 --> 33:46.400
Who was going to provide that perspective though?

33:46.400 --> 33:51.400
Alright, well, let's take a look at our final Jeopardy category, Lives That Matter.

33:51.400 --> 33:59.560
Well, it was good while it lasted though.

33:59.560 --> 34:03.240
This is Saturday Night Live, a comedy sketch show that has become a mainstay of late night

34:03.240 --> 34:04.240
TV.

34:04.240 --> 34:06.760
It has gradually evolved with the media and political landscape, and has persisted to

34:06.760 --> 34:09.620
stay relevant with an array of guest stars and performing acts.

34:09.620 --> 34:12.960
Despite pulling sizeable view counts, younger generations haven't exactly taken to its

34:12.960 --> 34:16.960
brand of heavy-handed and often cringe-inducing humour, especially given that their sketches

34:16.960 --> 34:20.400
often focus on topics that older audiences buy more affinity with.

34:20.400 --> 34:23.940
So it may have come as a surprise to viewers, when out of all the internet dramas one could

34:23.940 --> 34:40.160
potentially satirise, SNL decided to produce a sketch about the Try Guys, featuring high-profile

34:40.160 --> 34:43.800
Oscar-nominated actor Brendan Gleeson, who I'm sure is chuffed to be a part of this

34:43.800 --> 34:45.120
slice of internet history.

34:45.120 --> 34:49.080
The sketch follows a news anchor who is attempting to report on the latest current affairs, but

34:49.080 --> 34:52.360
is continuously interrupted by their field correspondent who wishes to report on the

34:52.360 --> 34:53.360
Try Guys drama.

34:53.360 --> 35:18.480
The

35:18.480 --> 35:22.120
sketch also references the Try Guys original response video, which features caricatures

35:22.120 --> 35:26.000
of the cast members, who also avidly interrupt the news to try and make the situation about

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
them, which derails the news bulletin entirely with the anchor's voice of reason being

35:30.000 --> 35:56.120
drowned out.

35:56.120 --> 35:59.600
In spite of the laugh tracks, many viewers did not see the funny side of this, especially

35:59.600 --> 36:03.240
when they felt SNL had missed the point of the situation, with many referring to SNL's

36:03.240 --> 36:06.760
past on-set controversies as consistent with the message of this sketch.

36:06.760 --> 36:10.040
The sketch's message appears at first to be lampooning the media's response, but

36:10.040 --> 36:13.280
quickly sets their sights on the Try Guys themselves, and what they perceive to be their

36:13.280 --> 36:16.840
over-dramatic handling of the video, whilst still ignoring the follow-up response from

36:16.840 --> 36:17.840
Zach and Keith.

36:17.840 --> 36:21.020
Amongst dedicated fans, theories spread that Ned's background in comedy was allowing

36:21.020 --> 36:25.040
him to pull some strings to hit back without attaching his name to it, and many refer to

36:25.040 --> 36:28.200
clips where Ned had spoken about having ties to SNL.

36:28.200 --> 36:31.060
Interestingly enough, on the same podcast episode, the producer that he had cheated

36:31.060 --> 36:50.000
on his wife with also spoke about their connections on the show.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.520
This was obviously completely conjectural, but was also a potential explanation for why

36:53.520 --> 36:57.440
SNL decided to dip their toes in YouTube drama at this specific time.

36:57.440 --> 37:00.720
Many collaborates with the Try Guys mostly made the case for them on social media, while

37:00.720 --> 37:04.280
the Try Guys themselves moreover attempted to say as little as possible, or at least

37:04.280 --> 37:05.880
see the funny side of it.

37:05.880 --> 37:09.240
Nevertheless, this trust was appearing to get the better of some members, as Zach in

37:09.240 --> 37:13.080
particular ended up in a spat with Dream, something that he felt was the result of the

37:13.080 --> 37:17.240
past few weeks, and the inability to talk about details that he felt had been misrepresented

37:17.240 --> 37:18.240
in the media.

37:18.240 --> 37:43.560
It also appeared to be causing tension between audience members and people who were associated

37:43.560 --> 37:45.040
with any critical content.

37:45.040 --> 37:48.960
It was also reported that, in a short Instagram Live section, Bowen Yang, who played Eugene

37:48.960 --> 37:52.640
in the SNL sketch, spoke briefly about the subsequent backlash, stating that they may

37:52.640 --> 37:56.320
have misunderstood how it all played out, but also felt that people who were not involved

37:56.320 --> 37:59.600
with the piece were being implicated, and that this was simply not the case.

37:59.600 --> 38:03.840
He also felt the Try Guys had incited audience members to attack them as their podcast account

38:03.840 --> 38:06.360
had received rather significant levels of harassment.

38:06.360 --> 38:10.320
There is no evidence of any direct incitement, but it seems like emotion still ran high within

38:10.320 --> 38:13.840
the Try Guys and their audience, particularly in how they are responding to a decision that

38:13.840 --> 38:15.680
would be emotional for a lot of people.

38:15.680 --> 38:19.600
Nonetheless, poorly received by many as it was, the SNL sketch did represent a sect of

38:19.600 --> 38:23.920
the online populace that didn't really understand why what the Try Guys did had to be such a

38:23.920 --> 38:28.120
monumental decision, and that although acknowledging what Ned did was wrong, didn't feel that

38:28.120 --> 38:32.280
he should be spoken about and treated in such a way, a way that to them provoked the worst

38:32.280 --> 38:35.960
of the internet to launch a very emotionally charged response to anybody involved.

38:36.400 --> 38:43.240
We have prided ourselves for the last eight years on being undramatic boys, and I cannot

38:43.240 --> 38:44.640
wait to go back there.

38:44.640 --> 38:47.920
Although the Try Guys seem to have quashed concerns regarding their knowledge of Ned

38:47.920 --> 38:51.720
Fulmer's infidelity, or the concern that they did not act quickly or take it seriously

38:51.720 --> 38:55.640
enough, a new narrative was being raised by the media, as to whether they had overcorrected

38:55.640 --> 38:59.320
and caused people to feel too invested in a situation that was ultimately not their

38:59.320 --> 39:00.320
business.

39:00.320 --> 39:04.200
It really looked like the Try Guys couldn't win, no matter how hard they tried.

39:05.960 --> 39:18.560
The truth was that the Try Guys were placed in a very awkward position, because on one

39:18.560 --> 39:22.040
hand they wanted to clear up these misconceptions, but on the other they were deeply aware of

39:22.040 --> 39:25.640
the possible legal ramifications of doing so, which allowed people who weren't necessarily

39:25.640 --> 39:29.200
confined by those chains to speculate, and if the Try Guys attempted to respond, there

39:29.200 --> 39:33.320
were concerns of harassment given how deeply invested many people were in this drama.

39:33.320 --> 39:57.600
Most of the time they were bound to silence, but some felt that this was their own doing.

39:57.600 --> 40:01.360
Towards the end of October, once again the media decided to take advantage of this silence,

40:01.360 --> 40:04.760
this time in the form of a more academic think piece from the New York Times, a paper

40:04.760 --> 40:08.800
that had previously published and updated an article following the Try Guys drama, something

40:08.800 --> 40:10.200
they covered from the jump.

40:10.200 --> 40:13.880
Their article this time, The Try Guys and the Prison of Online Fame, approaches the

40:13.880 --> 40:17.440
matter from a more philosophical standpoint, and seeks to explain the Try Guys' response

40:17.440 --> 40:21.800
from the perspective of fan appeasement, describing their first response as resembling a hostage

40:21.800 --> 40:26.520
video and their supposed outrage as a performance, attempting to calm the nerds of distrustful

40:26.520 --> 40:27.720
and anxious fans.

40:27.720 --> 40:31.080
The author acknowledges the power dynamics, but still questions why the Try Guys spoke

40:31.120 --> 40:35.640
about Ned like he was John Wayne Gacy, ultimately concluding that there likely was this understanding

40:35.640 --> 40:39.200
from the Try Guys that it wasn't that big a deal, but that they acted more out of threat

40:39.200 --> 40:41.120
of losing audience than anything else.

40:41.120 --> 40:45.080
Beer's response to this was similarly hostile, with many audiences stating that this sought

40:45.080 --> 40:48.640
to downplay a serious situation, but the author of the article would probably state that these

40:48.640 --> 40:52.680
are the people that the Try Guys were seeking to appease, so there would be little movement

40:52.680 --> 40:53.880
in that discourse.

40:53.880 --> 40:57.880
Keith's wife responded to this article expressing annoyance at its existence, but otherwise

40:57.880 --> 41:01.240
there wasn't a matter response, and the article did accrue a fair amount of twitter

41:01.240 --> 41:03.720
likes, so that's some metric I suppose.

41:03.720 --> 41:07.460
The media continued to loiter around the situation for a bit, playing with narratives that often

41:07.460 --> 41:10.640
surrounded business, but all in all there was silence for a while.

41:10.640 --> 41:14.240
The Try Guys did not want to be caught defending their decisions forever, and they likely knew

41:14.240 --> 41:15.480
that they had to move on.

41:15.480 --> 41:18.800
In the coming weeks they appeared to do this, the producer appeared to remove any credits

41:18.800 --> 41:22.040
of her involvement with the Try Guys, and the Try Guys stopped crediting her in video

41:22.040 --> 41:25.680
descriptions, implying a mutual agreement for her departure had also been reached.

41:25.680 --> 41:29.400
Ned was also gradually edited and written out, where possible, the title card for their

41:29.400 --> 41:33.520
new season of their show Without A Recipe was subtitled Everything Is Fine, a totally

41:33.520 --> 41:37.440
normal season, and Ned who appeared in episodes that were recorded before his suspension was

41:37.440 --> 41:39.320
now replaced with an animated elephant.

41:39.320 --> 41:43.560
They also edited old thumbnails of Without A Recipe to exclude Ned, likely anticipating

41:43.560 --> 41:47.560
the release of the show, and would intend to disassociate him from the series as a whole,

41:47.560 --> 41:50.760
especially given that it was one of the series they were promoting through a more commercial

41:50.760 --> 41:51.760
platform, Kizwii.

41:51.760 --> 41:55.040
However, with this in mind, they had to move back towards promotional work eventually,

41:55.080 --> 41:58.680
part of their channel required them to exist in the public sphere, and although it felt

41:58.680 --> 42:02.280
like people's interest in the subject had waned in the weeks prior, it also didn't

42:02.280 --> 42:04.240
feel like they'd fully moved on from it.

42:04.240 --> 42:06.160
What steps were they going to take to ensure that?

42:06.160 --> 42:10.600
Well the first was an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, where Habersberger, Yang, and Kornfeld

42:10.600 --> 42:13.760
talk about their plans to move forward from the scandal of the past few months.

42:13.760 --> 42:16.880
They talk about their upcoming projects, in particular Without A Recipe, state that they

42:16.880 --> 42:20.560
intend to remain as the Try Guys, but also that they intend to move away from the viral

42:20.560 --> 42:24.320
content that made them popular, and towards broadcast TV, as they feel they can work on

42:24.320 --> 42:28.160
more ambitious projects and invest more resources, something they've probably felt constrained

42:28.160 --> 42:29.160
by in the past.

42:29.160 --> 42:32.800
YG- Can I plant an idea in your head, guys?

42:32.800 --> 42:39.320
YG- Please, just consider it, I think it's a real good option.

42:39.320 --> 42:43.200
The first few questions go by pretty likely, but then Eugene chimes in to discuss the media

42:43.200 --> 42:47.040
coverage of the issue, talking about how they had presented the Try Guys as a happy-go-lucky

42:47.040 --> 42:50.580
troupe to contrast that image against the drama, and pointing out that they had readily

42:50.580 --> 42:54.460
tackled many more serious and sobering topics, ones that people who didn't merely take a

42:54.460 --> 42:56.100
cursory glance would have known.

42:56.100 --> 42:59.020
He aligns their handling of these subjects with their response, and states that other

42:59.020 --> 43:03.460
workplaces with more traditional values simply aren't as upfront, and he's proud of the team's

43:03.460 --> 43:05.100
reaction to what transpired.

43:05.100 --> 43:08.240
They talk about upcoming projects such as Kees' Off-Broadway show with a general tone

43:08.240 --> 43:12.180
of optimism, and that reiterates what he said in the podcast episode, this was the best

43:12.180 --> 43:16.040
outcome for them, calling it an evolution point, and not too soon after they decide

43:16.040 --> 43:17.540
to start that evolution.

43:18.540 --> 43:21.940
Well, what a year it's been!

43:21.940 --> 43:22.940
F*** yeah.

43:22.940 --> 43:27.860
On the 17th of December, the Try Guys uploaded a video titled What Happens Next, sat down

43:27.860 --> 43:30.540
on the couch once more, reminiscent of their first video.

43:30.540 --> 43:34.180
This time, they appear to be in much higher spirits, though they do have some pretty significant

43:34.180 --> 43:35.500
announcements to make.

43:36.500 --> 43:40.600
Look, that era of the Try Guys is officially over.

43:40.600 --> 43:45.000
It was an incredible, once in a lifetime ride, and we really, truly, honestly cannot thank

43:45.000 --> 43:46.900
you enough for being a part of it.

43:47.900 --> 43:57.580
But, with happy endings comes the opportunity for happier beginnings, and as the Try Guys,

43:57.580 --> 43:59.580
we're just getting started.

44:02.180 --> 44:05.700
Although they state that this era of the Try Guys will be coming to an end, they also set

44:05.700 --> 44:09.540
forth their plans for the coming year, including multiple projects that will be more ambitious

44:09.540 --> 44:13.720
and high production, also using this upload as a preview for their interactive live finale

44:13.720 --> 44:14.980
of Without A Recipe.

44:15.940 --> 44:19.260
We're working on sorts, all sorts of crazy stuff.

44:19.260 --> 44:24.860
It's going to mean taking some risks, doing things that maybe aren't as algorithm-optimized,

44:24.860 --> 44:29.420
but honestly, f*** it, f*** it.

44:29.420 --> 44:30.520
We only give them a life.

44:30.520 --> 44:36.660
We have the Without A Recipe live finale, we got five incredible main season episodes

44:36.660 --> 44:39.800
this year, and tonight, we're doing something we've never done before, our little something

44:39.800 --> 44:46.200
extra special, six cameras, live cooking, live voting, live judging, live Keith yelling,

44:46.200 --> 44:47.200
perhaps?

44:47.200 --> 44:48.200
Perhaps.

44:48.200 --> 44:52.640
All in all, despite the video including aesthetic callbacks to their What Happened upload, it

44:52.640 --> 44:56.960
doesn't feel like they're trying to necessarily emulate it, more rewrite it, and associate

44:56.960 --> 45:01.240
it with the evolution that Zack had previously alluded to in the Hollywood Reporter interview.

45:01.240 --> 45:04.520
Although accruing a few million views, the news cycle didn't really pick up from it,

45:04.520 --> 45:08.620
and it appears that the storm had mostly passed finally, Ned had remained silent on all social

45:08.620 --> 45:12.640
media platforms since his parting statement, which almost seemed like a silent seal of

45:12.640 --> 45:17.420
validation for the crew and their plans to take the group forward into greener pastures.

45:17.420 --> 45:28.660
What would they find there though?

45:28.660 --> 45:44.220
The newer era of the Try Guys may not appear particularly striking on the surface, they

45:44.220 --> 45:47.460
haven't exactly changed too much about their YouTube content, it's still built off a

45:47.460 --> 45:51.140
similar premise, and outside of that, other than the rather subtle rebranding, there's

45:51.140 --> 45:53.660
nothing that will particularly jump out at the average viewer.

45:53.660 --> 45:57.100
With that said, they have been experimenting with certain concepts, such as the interactive

45:57.100 --> 46:00.220
experience they tried on Kizwii the year before, recently announcing that they would

46:00.220 --> 46:04.320
be performing Romeo and Juliet, but with the audience deciding and voting on how certain

46:04.320 --> 46:21.660
scenes and plotlines are resolved, however it was also about what was going on beyond

46:21.660 --> 46:24.700
the Try Guys, and how their lives were developing as individuals.

46:24.700 --> 46:28.020
There was this sense that the Try Guys label was somewhat constraining on its own, and

46:28.020 --> 46:30.000
that they should be engaging in their own ventures.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.720
Keith turned up to VidCon with his comedy band, Lou Burger, and performed a few tunes

46:33.720 --> 46:37.480
of their own, went on a small tour, and even performed a sold out off-Broadway musical,

46:37.480 --> 46:38.540
The Wizard of Friendship.

46:38.540 --> 46:42.220
Keith arguably has the most consistently successful series on the Try Guys YouTube channel with

46:42.220 --> 46:45.260
his Eats Everything uploads, which is what it sounds like.

46:45.260 --> 46:48.480
Zack Gia was seemingly busy, but probably the most significant development in his life

46:48.480 --> 46:52.260
was the news that he had officially tied the knot with his partner Maggie, which was pretty

46:52.260 --> 47:03.220
notable given that many doubted that it would ever happen.

47:03.220 --> 47:07.040
Eugene probably had the most eventful year of them all though, securing two voice acting

47:07.040 --> 47:11.160
roles in major productions, Nimona and Star Wars Visions, he was also cast in an upcoming

47:11.160 --> 47:14.820
live-action romance film, but the details of that aren't too well known, other than

47:14.820 --> 47:15.980
it sounds pretty gay.

47:15.980 --> 47:19.660
He also announced that he would be writing a two-part young adult fantasy book called

47:19.660 --> 47:22.120
The Unders, to be released in 2024.

47:22.120 --> 47:25.760
Not too much is known about that either, other than it sounds pretty gay.

47:25.760 --> 47:29.000
He's probably the least featured in YouTube videos due to the pursuit of these ventures,

47:29.000 --> 47:32.720
but he still clearly considers himself part of the posse, and continues to involve himself

47:32.720 --> 47:33.720
where needed.

47:33.720 --> 47:37.280
It's clear that over time he much prefers the more performative side of media, and doesn't

47:37.280 --> 47:41.360
necessarily want to bear too much of his private life, often leaving Keith and Zack to represent

47:41.360 --> 47:43.440
the group in podcasts and media interviews.

47:43.440 --> 47:46.680
With this in mind, the dynamic of the Try Guys appears to have changed a little, and

47:46.680 --> 47:49.580
whereas in the past, Zack had been portrayed as the baby of the group, now he seemed to

47:49.580 --> 47:51.340
have taken up a more vocal position.

47:51.340 --> 47:54.700
This side was definitely on show in the podcast episode addressing the situation, but many

47:54.700 --> 47:58.220
were still pleasantly surprised to see him this outspoken, it allowed him to convey a

47:58.220 --> 48:01.500
degree of confidence in his narratives, which was important when Ned was still a common

48:01.500 --> 48:05.620
subject of discourse for many, and yet a highly sensitive one where any verbal blunder could

48:05.620 --> 48:06.980
result in a lawsuit.

48:06.980 --> 48:10.800
Now, we are finding our company in a much healthier place.

48:10.800 --> 48:15.880
I think that it brought us all together, it allowed us to reevaluate what we want to focus

48:15.880 --> 48:26.200
our energies on, and to shape the company and our image to be less driven maybe by short

48:26.200 --> 48:32.320
term goals, and to really recommit to our audience what we care about.

48:32.320 --> 48:35.840
Yeah, in spite of all that pressure, they seem to be handling it well, they don't

48:35.840 --> 48:39.160
seem too fussed about the notion of variety anymore, more interested in consolidating

48:39.160 --> 48:41.720
their audience and creating a strong relationship with them.

48:41.720 --> 48:44.600
They mostly refrain from talking about Ned himself, though it's clear that they do

48:44.600 --> 48:48.440
feel betrayed by his actions, and even seem suspicious of subsequent events that occurred

48:48.440 --> 49:00.280
such as the SNL sketch.

49:00.280 --> 49:03.920
With that said though, they seemed to be content with the outcome, although they had seen success

49:03.920 --> 49:08.000
akin to a sort of fever dream in the past, being woken by the scandal had allowed them

49:08.000 --> 49:10.800
to reevaluate their priorities and mature as a group.

49:10.800 --> 49:14.720
There is this renewed sense of unity rooted in that tough situation, and how they subsequently

49:14.720 --> 49:15.720
navigated it.

49:15.720 --> 49:19.920
Their concern was maintaining those principles that they felt were built on, and in retrospect

49:19.920 --> 49:26.160
they felt they had succeeded in doing that.

49:26.160 --> 49:29.460
Maybe the Try Guys would never be as ubiquitous as they once were, but they didn't seem

49:29.460 --> 49:33.820
too fazed by that, more focusing on content and strategies that matured as they felt they

49:33.820 --> 49:36.980
had, and experiencing a degree of shared stability through it.

49:36.980 --> 49:41.580
After all, they'd never expected this success in 2014 when it all began, anything was just

49:41.580 --> 49:42.580
a bonus.

49:42.580 --> 49:45.820
Audiences who were still around expressed that they found the new Dynamite quite enjoyable,

49:45.820 --> 49:48.540
and didn't find themselves missing Ned one bit.

49:48.540 --> 49:52.120
Some found themselves reflecting on old clips and wondering if he ever really fit in, though

49:52.120 --> 49:55.740
some still expressed sadness that the child had lost Ariel and wished her well.

49:55.740 --> 49:56.980
But what about the pair?

49:56.980 --> 49:59.100
Were they still even a pair?

49:59.100 --> 50:02.200
While since pledging to put family first, there have been mostly radio silence from

50:02.200 --> 50:07.080
Ned and his relative social media platforms for the majority of 2023, with some speculating

50:07.080 --> 50:08.740
on the status of his marriage with Ariel.

50:08.740 --> 50:12.580
Well, just shy of 11 months after he had been dismissed from the Try Guys, Ned appeared

50:12.580 --> 50:16.380
on his sister Grace's Instagram story, looking like he had prematurely entered his mid-life

50:16.380 --> 50:21.220
crisis, attending Taylor Swift's era's tour with no one other than his wife, Ariel.

50:21.220 --> 50:24.220
They appeared to be in good spirits, and left the concert together as well.

50:24.220 --> 50:27.820
Although this was not shared by Ariel or Ned, it quickly made its way online, as outlets

50:27.820 --> 50:31.540
reported that even after the Try Guys had officially cut ties with Ned, his marriage

50:31.540 --> 50:35.340
remained sturdy, and many viewers and fans expressed shock towards Ned and Ariel for

50:35.340 --> 50:36.340
making amends.

50:36.340 --> 50:38.180
I'll discuss that more in a bit though.

50:38.180 --> 50:41.720
Nonetheless, although Ned seems to have refrained from speaking about the situation, and there

50:41.720 --> 50:45.100
are still questions hanging over his head regarding it, he seems to have retained what

50:45.100 --> 50:48.500
was always most important in his life, his family.

50:48.500 --> 50:53.800
In the end, although it was a rather painful process, maybe everyone got what they wanted.

50:53.800 --> 50:54.660
Allow me to elaborate.

50:57.820 --> 51:06.780
At the start of the video, I spoke about the notion of growth, and how, with many collectives,

51:06.780 --> 51:10.400
it's very difficult to keep them together when individual goals are constantly changing

51:10.400 --> 51:11.400
and evolving.

51:11.400 --> 51:14.500
When you have a team of people like Team 10 where everyone is vying for their own taste

51:14.500 --> 51:18.980
of stardom, the creative constraints that can be placed on one can feel extremely suffocating.

51:18.980 --> 51:23.500
The Try Guys would never like Team 10 though, for them, the success was always a bonus.

51:23.500 --> 51:26.260
There was a strong level of trust between each individual, and members were allowed

51:26.260 --> 51:29.060
to go off and pursue ventures on their own terms.

51:29.060 --> 51:32.500
Why I left Buzzfeed is really this.

51:32.500 --> 51:37.260
The whole time we felt like there was more that we could be doing and giving to you,

51:37.260 --> 51:38.260
and now's that time.

51:38.260 --> 51:41.020
At the same time, when you create something, there's still the desire to move forward

51:41.020 --> 51:44.380
with it, and that was illustrated with their departure from Buzzfeed, that was the freedom

51:44.380 --> 51:46.980
that they had yearned for, and they appeared to make the most of it.

51:46.980 --> 51:50.300
This sort of trust between the members allowed them to grow the Try Guys as a brand while

51:50.300 --> 51:52.220
also exploring their own interests.

51:52.220 --> 51:55.820
With that said, there's always the threat that maybe a creative avenue has been exhausted.

51:55.820 --> 51:59.340
Even with complete control, your brand is still regulated by the premises that you set

51:59.340 --> 52:00.340
it up on.

52:00.340 --> 52:03.560
With people associating your names with a certain idea of content, it can be very difficult

52:03.560 --> 52:15.060
to escape the shadow that viral content can create.

52:15.060 --> 52:18.820
By Covid lockdown era, the Try Guys had been going for 7 years, and although they clearly

52:18.820 --> 52:22.260
enjoyed what they were doing, they were trying to break out of the cage that they had often

52:22.260 --> 52:26.400
been assigned to by the media, as the happy-go-lucky Buzzfeed chaps who just wanted to do things

52:26.400 --> 52:27.400
for a laugh.

52:27.400 --> 52:30.780
Any behaviour outside of the pre-conditioned ideas would surely shatter the brand that

52:30.780 --> 52:33.180
they had so carefully assembled over the years.

52:33.180 --> 52:36.700
Unfortunately, that's what restlessness begets within an individual.

52:36.700 --> 52:39.920
Restlessness can be externalised through a variety of expressions, for some it's exploring

52:39.920 --> 52:43.940
new creative avenues, for others it's about perfecting their craft in a current one.

52:43.940 --> 52:47.020
Restlessness is something that can often beget growth and forward movement in a person's

52:47.020 --> 52:50.380
life, the desire to do something more, and nevertheless, it can also be something quite

52:50.380 --> 52:54.260
negative, it can yield reckless, thrill-seeking behaviour that may not necessarily be within

52:54.260 --> 52:56.440
the bounds of what's expected of them.

52:56.440 --> 52:59.680
Restlessness is not something that can only manifest itself within a career, it can evince

52:59.680 --> 53:03.380
itself over any part of a person's life that may seem stagnant to them.

53:03.380 --> 53:06.820
Every single one of the Try Guys probably experienced that restlessness in some sense,

53:06.820 --> 53:10.100
I'm sure they'd all gone through a phase of considering leaving the trip, creating

53:10.100 --> 53:13.700
their own path, pursuing what they cared about, they were probably wondering how to address

53:13.700 --> 53:14.700
that lull.

53:14.700 --> 53:31.260
And then along came Ned, I can't look into Ned's mind and tell everyone exactly why

53:31.260 --> 53:35.060
he did what he did, I don't think he's some evil big who wanted to wreck years of

53:35.060 --> 53:36.060
hard work.

53:36.060 --> 53:39.180
Although many people haven't exactly heaped praise onto his character, most have refrained

53:39.180 --> 53:43.260
from representing him as this cruel or malevolent figure, more of portraying him as someone

53:43.260 --> 53:46.620
who was not entirely up front with the person he truly was at work.

53:46.620 --> 53:49.940
Instead of possibly seeking to address the issues that were challenging him within his

53:49.940 --> 53:53.860
personal and work life, he likely chose to address his frustrations by pursuing a life

53:53.860 --> 53:58.100
outside of the Try Guys, yet as his family became more aligned with his work he turned

53:58.100 --> 54:02.660
away from that as well, finding a workplace affair as the slice of life that he desired.

54:02.660 --> 54:06.780
There was no ambiguity given how long it persisted for, he wanted it, and although some people

54:06.780 --> 54:10.180
may not have been shocked by it, they did seem to be shocked about how public he ended

54:10.180 --> 54:11.180
up being with it.

54:11.180 --> 54:14.900
Boldly sacrificing an image he had spent years constructing, and placing the public

54:14.900 --> 54:18.820
image of the Try Guys into jeopardy, Ned was someone with a degree of intelligence, and

54:18.820 --> 54:22.120
although some wouldn't be wrong to assign arrogance to his behaviour, there was a sense

54:22.120 --> 54:25.980
that he just didn't really care about what he created, or the repercussions his actions

54:25.980 --> 54:28.060
could have, until they revealed themselves.

54:28.060 --> 54:31.900
Ned Fomer is no longer working with the Try Guys.

54:31.900 --> 54:35.380
Whereas Zach, Keith, and Eugene may have possessed different ideas for how they wanted the Try

54:35.380 --> 54:39.740
Guys to be represented, their unanimity in response to Ned's infidelity, regardless

54:39.740 --> 54:43.700
of whether one believes it's proportionate, brought them back onto the same page mentally.

54:43.700 --> 54:46.980
There appeared to be no second thoughts to how this should be dealt with, and they seemed

54:46.980 --> 54:50.740
to act as swiftly as they conceivably could, in spite of the many legal hurdles that may

54:50.740 --> 54:53.860
present themselves in removing a member as established as Ned.

54:53.860 --> 54:57.420
Nevertheless, although this may have united them in the sense of how they felt about this

54:57.420 --> 55:00.780
issue, there was still the threat of tearing down everything they ever constructed, but

55:00.780 --> 55:03.020
in time it seemed like that's what they needed.

55:03.020 --> 55:06.380
The Try Guys possessed a desire to move forward, but when you've been established for years

55:06.380 --> 55:09.820
with your own company, with everything you require to succeed, it can be hard to see

55:09.820 --> 55:11.980
where you can even move forward from that.

55:11.980 --> 55:13.940
Sometimes you have to go back first.

55:13.940 --> 55:17.920
Ned's actions did that indubitably, it snapped the Try Guys out of the cycle they've been

55:17.920 --> 55:21.940
living for so long, and forced them to step outside their frequency brand image to address

55:21.940 --> 55:23.760
a man who had broken his.

55:23.760 --> 55:27.700
No longer were the Try Guys perceived as the friction-free kings that so many audiences

55:27.700 --> 55:31.980
found comfort in, they had their own struggle, but in that struggle they seemed to find their

55:31.980 --> 55:43.300
own liberation.

55:43.300 --> 55:47.580
The Try Guys had spent their post-buzzfeed time trying to establish more distinct relationships

55:47.580 --> 55:51.700
between their individual members and their fans, and the characters they created, but

55:51.700 --> 55:56.140
for the first time in a while it felt like the Try Guys had something new together, even

55:56.140 --> 55:58.060
if it was with one less member.

55:58.060 --> 56:02.340
No longer was that struggle provoking sentiments of separation that might pull them apart,

56:02.340 --> 56:04.780
it was that struggle that brought them together.

56:04.780 --> 56:08.060
There was a sense that maybe all the Try Guys were looking for more, and that the more they

56:08.060 --> 56:13.560
could be looking for could be achieved in that world without Ned.

56:13.560 --> 56:23.060
It was the best outcome, but was it the just outcome?

56:23.060 --> 56:37.780
I think the SNL sketch got it 50% correct.

56:37.780 --> 56:41.900
We talk about a lot of internet drama as creators, a lot of it remains within the confines of

56:41.900 --> 56:45.860
YouTube though, and occasionally makes the rounds of peripheral social media-oriented

56:45.860 --> 56:46.860
outlets.

56:46.860 --> 56:50.300
At a glance it's confusing to look at this situation, one can't help but wonder, out

56:50.300 --> 56:54.060
of all the stories that we cover online, that this one was the one that picked up the

56:54.060 --> 56:57.700
most traction on mainstream outlets, when there are so many more pressing issues in

56:57.700 --> 57:01.700
the world they could be turning their attention to, but nothing happens without a reason,

57:01.700 --> 57:06.020
and in reality there were a few conditions that likely made this subject more media friendly.

57:06.020 --> 57:10.620
First being that the Try Guys were, as creators go, inherently industry friendly themselves,

57:10.620 --> 57:14.620
they were YouTube based but possessed name recognition outside of it, second this wasn't

57:14.620 --> 57:18.460
a common occurrence, they were rather white bread, and any white bread character caught

57:18.460 --> 57:21.380
up in debauchery is always good clickbait.

57:21.380 --> 57:25.340
Third cheating isn't a crime, when a YouTuber finds themselves caught up in something more

57:25.340 --> 57:29.340
legally tender, news outlets can find themselves rather hesitant in case they accidentally

57:29.340 --> 57:32.140
publicise something that could be construed as libel.

57:32.140 --> 57:35.540
Although they probably would be able to argue good faith in court, most of the time they

57:35.540 --> 57:39.780
simply don't want to, the Try Guys scandal simply was the perfect combination of news

57:39.780 --> 57:43.980
that was surprising enough to grab the attention of media outlets, yet PG enough to report

57:43.980 --> 57:45.720
on with some degree of confidence.

57:45.720 --> 57:49.480
It was too much for the actual story, and it inevitably caused a lot of undue coverage

57:49.480 --> 57:53.720
and harassment of all individuals involved, but the SNL sketch didn't stop there, it

57:53.720 --> 57:57.320
implied that the Try Guys contributed to that with their video on the matter.

57:57.320 --> 58:02.180
Look at me, this is the face of grief.

58:02.180 --> 58:05.800
This angle represented a more sceptical side of the internet that felt that this hadn't

58:05.800 --> 58:09.300
been handled with respect to the family at the centre of it, and was merely published

58:09.300 --> 58:13.120
as a way for them to rescue their reputation that had been brought into contention by the

58:13.120 --> 58:14.120
scandal.

58:14.120 --> 58:17.400
This was echoed by the NYT think piece, which didn't necessarily appear hostile to the

58:17.400 --> 58:21.260
Try Guys, more presented them as a victim of internet culture, being forced to throw

58:21.260 --> 58:24.120
their friend under the bus to save their own skins.

58:24.120 --> 58:27.640
After all, Ned former was not our generation's Ted Bundy, was he?

58:27.640 --> 58:34.800
In new photos captured Wednesday, Ned walks ahead of Ariel, looking unfazed by the scandal,

58:34.800 --> 58:37.800
and in this snap, her expression says it all.

58:37.800 --> 58:41.800
It's somewhat strange to see part of the source of mass attention pointing fingers

58:41.800 --> 58:45.680
at the Try Guys responding to a situation that the media blew up.

58:45.680 --> 58:48.900
The Try Guys didn't want to have to defend themselves in that way, but the theories were

58:48.900 --> 58:53.160
manifesting every single day, and their response, although somewhat terse, was the best way

58:53.160 --> 58:55.680
they could muster up under considerable pressure.

58:55.680 --> 58:59.080
Their language sought to relay a timeline of events, but also exonerate themselves from

58:59.080 --> 59:00.080
any knowledge.

59:00.080 --> 59:03.420
They wanted to halt the speculation in the clearest way possible, but their personal

59:03.420 --> 59:05.680
sentiments still reached the surface.

59:05.680 --> 59:09.120
The truth is though, that there was always going to be a personal element to it, and

59:09.120 --> 59:12.840
it's very hard to navigate that while also being sensitive to the legality of Ned's

59:12.840 --> 59:13.840
removal.

59:13.840 --> 59:16.960
In a way, by stating what were perceived as facts, rather than actually delving into their

59:16.960 --> 59:20.780
feelings, but still not necessarily being able to completely subdue their emotions,

59:20.780 --> 59:24.840
they turn what they viewed as a simple workplace violation into a very loaded discourse.

59:24.840 --> 59:28.600
There was a lot they probably would have said behind the scenes, they did not say here.

59:28.600 --> 59:31.840
Probably one of the most telling moments was Keith being cut off before he could speak

59:31.840 --> 59:34.000
properly about that sentiment of betrayal.

59:34.000 --> 59:40.880
What happened, it betrayed our trust, and it was a workplace violation, it would mean

59:40.880 --> 59:46.160
to all the people in our office who knew what they knew, they would know that we were in

59:46.160 --> 59:50.120
the face of everything, like not being true to who we say we are in our value.

59:50.120 --> 59:53.880
I think betrayal is what underlined a lot of the emotional response by the Try Guys.

59:53.880 --> 59:57.960
So some critics, Ned's actions wouldn't or shouldn't have resulted in a dismissal, which

59:57.960 --> 01:00:01.100
is why they may not necessarily see why it bothered them so much.

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:04.160
On the other hand, if it was such a cut and dry decision, then why do they need these

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.840
videos to justify themselves?

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:09.500
There are loads of questions that one might ask to put into contention the often complicated

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:13.820
reasons issued in that time, and these seemingly often austere measures, such as fully erasing

01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:18.080
Ned's presence from pre-recorded videos, but the reality is that what isn't spoken about

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.780
is probably what they felt more.

01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:24.180
For the Try Guys, firing Ned was exactly why it mattered so much, regardless of what motive

01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:27.940
Ned had behind his actions, outside the fact that he had put up this family man facade

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:31.240
to all of them while maintaining an at least months long workplace relationship to the

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:34.100
others rather than just being upfront with them and admitting he was struggling with

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:37.500
his faithfulness, he must've known what he was putting at stake by doing this, not just

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:41.760
the entire brand image but also their friendship which was largely tied up in that business.

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:45.000
These are the guys who had built an empire together for 8 years, who had crafted such

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.260
a deep relationship, not just with their viewers but with each other, and where some would

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:52.060
argue that the Try Guys sold Ned down the river and discarded those memories, putting

01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:55.920
their interests above those of a friend, it was Ned who really put his own personal interests

01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:00.100
above those of his friends first, doing it so brazenly to the point where even fans took

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:03.660
notice, either he thought his friends wouldn't take action against him despite him lying

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:07.420
to them and his audience, or he didn't care enough about what repercussions they would

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:11.340
have to sanction and the stress it may invoke, both scenarios that show a disregard for that

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:13.620
friendship he proclaimed so loudly.

01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:16.860
Even if you don't believe the Try Guys claims that they would've dismissed Ned regardless

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:20.780
of who informed them, the exhaustion and frustration of having someone you think fondly of putting

01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:24.640
the onus on you to punish them when you would rather be helping them sort their shit out

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:28.700
is an incredibly draining experience, Keith, Zach, and Eugene took no pleasure in what

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:32.000
they did, and I think that's what people see when watching that video, the sadness

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.380
of losing a colleague, a friend, and questioning why it had to happen, and sure you could say

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:40.540
that it didn't have to happen that way, that all the reactions airbrushing his existence

01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:44.700
were not necessary, and I get that, but for the Try Guys at least it made sense in that

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:49.500
moment, because to them he'd already separated himself through his actions, so they separated

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:50.500
him.

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:59.000
Even if it made sense that the media were predisposed to cover this subject, it was

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.280
still surprising for all, even the Try Guys, but their decision was already made, and for

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:07.540
the media to present their public explanation of actions they'd already carried out in private

01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:12.040
as performative felt more like a way to account for their own excitement surrounding a situation

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:16.260
which they probably would have all rather handled in private anyway, and yet it became

01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:19.780
greater than most internet dramas will ever be.

01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:27.580
For a brief spell, Ned Forman was one of the most maligned people online, and that just

01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:32.340
didn't make sense to some, and to be honest, I understand it, although I would say that

01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:36.260
the Try Guys response was pretty proportional to the amount they were probably put through

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:40.460
when overseeing this situation and its aftermath, there definitely was something outside of

01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:44.660
his actions and the media response that made people on social media take more personal

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.900
umbrage with him than they should have.

01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:47.900
How come?

01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:53.200
Ned Forman- If some cheating is happening, it's probably indicative of some deeper problems,

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:56.780
so if you say keep it in, I say tell the person.

01:02:56.780 --> 01:03:00.940
On a cursory look, Ned was the Try Guy with it all, he had a stable and successful career,

01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:05.140
a well connected network in multiple industries, a degree from a prolific university, he could

01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:08.340
practically walk into any job and assume whatever role he wished.

01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:12.200
At his core though, what completed him for many of his viewers, and the Try Guys fanbase

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.900
as a whole, was that family.

01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:17.860
Ned chose to make his family part of the online world, to present himself as that devoted

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:22.200
husband and family man, he made that part of his brand, however, he also came across

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:26.520
as extremely competitive, very driven, and intense to a significant fault.

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:30.200
I think there are very few personalities that are more prone to becoming restless, yet as

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:33.500
the person with likely the most consistent and stable life of the members of the Try

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:36.120
Guys, there did seem to be a contradiction of existence.

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:40.380
In spite of this, you never received the impression that this was a problem, even during the times

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:43.580
when fans found the cheating was occurring, he continued to talk about these matters like

01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:44.580
he was on top of them.

01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:45.580
Ned- Happy date night.

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:49.220
Jen- This is gonna be great, I think we did a really good job, and whatever happens.

01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:50.220
Ned- Whatever happens.

01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:51.220
Jen- I love you.

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:52.220
Ned- We're in it together.

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:53.220
I love you too.

01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:57.980
The fans Ned weaved an intricate web of deceit, he continued to profit off an image that simply

01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:02.860
was not the case, and all while his wife maintained this on the Try Guys channels as well, there

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:06.980
was something so shameless about his actions, and ultimately what they culminated in, that

01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:10.860
caused a lot of anger amongst people who thought they knew him better, the Try Guys

01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:11.860
included.

01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:16.180
I think that perceived privilege combined with his actions likely made his behaviour,

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:19.700
although not heinous on a standalone basis, rather insulting to all affected.

01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:24.300
Further to this, there was a very stark contrast between Ned and the rest of the Try Guys reaction,

01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:28.180
whereas they wanted to be as thorough as possible with their audience, Ned provided very little

01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:31.780
information, merely stating that he would be taking time off to focus on his family.

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:35.340
It appeared to many to be a somewhat callous statement that didn't necessarily recognise

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:38.500
the damage it had done to those involved, even though it was probably the best thing

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:42.100
he could commit to doing, for many it felt like he was saving face.

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:45.940
From this moment on, it was very easy for people to characterise Ned as that villain

01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:49.780
with the information they had available, and to reflect on his actions as always actually

01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:53.900
demonstrating something negative, perceiving him as this malevolent character.

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:57.980
Add to which is the mix, and he became a cartoonish caricature of the person he probably was,

01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:00.580
remembered for this singular incident and treated as such.

01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:03.980
All limp attempts to defend him through the media were theorised to be a result of his

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:08.060
doing, his attempts to get back at the Try Guys, despite the fact that there was no real

01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:13.420
evidence that he was involved, and that these would be very futile responses anyway.

01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:18.060
A lot of people have almost used the Try Guys thorough dissociation from Ned Forman to justify

01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:21.500
that he must have been the worst of the worst, but I just think they were upset at Ned for

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:24.900
being placed in that position, rather than thinking that he was actually scum of the

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:25.900
earth.

01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:29.520
The downside of there being business involvement in their separation is that it did lose that

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:33.700
human aspect, something that neither parties appear to want to talk about, in one of their

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:38.220
2023 interviews, a journalist asks Keith and Zack whether they still have any contact with Ned,

01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:42.460
and the publicist interrupts to inform them that they cannot speak on that matter, and although it is

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:47.220
not my place to hypothesise whether they do or they don't, I wouldn't be offended if they did,

01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:51.300
but I'm sure other people would be, which is why they'd rather leave it as an unknown quantity.

01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:56.700
After all, the one Try Guys associate who has publicly remained in his life has received flak for that decision.

01:05:56.700 --> 01:06:01.620
As noted earlier, when the news broke that she hadn't girl bossed him out of his life, there was a significant

01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:06.180
cohort of internet marriage counsellors who wanted to put the blame on her, who implied that she was

01:06:06.180 --> 01:06:10.540
enabling his behaviour by not divorcing him, people who want to tell you that actually co-parenting

01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:14.900
isn't so bad, and she might as well take the plunge, that she was sending a bad message to the children

01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:20.020
by not holding him accountable. These arguments range from hilarious to rather insulting to a mother

01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:24.660
who has probably been put through a fair share of personal turmoil trying to navigate a crisis within marriage.

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:29.460
Ariel former knows Ned better than any of us, and if she made the decision to stick with him and pursue

01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:33.660
happiness together, then I wish her the best with it. Just because you can't empathise with how she

01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:38.700
approaches it, doesn't mean she is objectively wrong. Accountability can come from a variety of avenues,

01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:43.100
it doesn't equate to ruining someone's life, and all the people trying to use the Try Guys to shame her

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:46.740
for not doing that should maybe reflect on what the Try Guys said themselves.

01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:53.340
Ned- We also want to remind you that the internet has a tendency to be a lot harsher towards women than men,

01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:56.940
so please, we ask that you exercise kindness.

01:06:57.060 --> 01:07:01.340
There is this Dunning-Kruger effect online where people just seem to assume that everything that happens

01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:06.300
publicly is exactly how it happened privately as well, that there's been no personal discussions about

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:11.980
responsibility, no remorse, no understanding or resolution between any party, which is strange given how much

01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:17.580
confidentiality was emphasised by the Try Guys. Sure, Ned could have made a half hour video about how sorry

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:22.660
he was, but would it have alleviated the situation? With all the intersections of public and private figures

01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:27.700
who were caught up in this web, the intense media interest, and the desire to actually not blow it out of proportion,

01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:32.900
I'm somewhat doubtful. If anything, the one thing Ned did right was walking away as quietly as possible

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:37.380
and seemingly rebuilding that marriage out of the public spotlight, something that I would say family

01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:42.100
relationships shouldn't be subjected to in the first place. What Ned did was wrong, and there was inevitably

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:47.260
upset and anger from those who actually cared about him and the person he presented himself as, those close

01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:52.060
to him, as well as those who could only watch over a screen. But for those talking about divorce, it already

01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:57.020
happened in a five minute video a year ago, and it looks like both sides received the settlement they were

01:07:57.020 --> 01:08:02.380
looking for, and if you have a problem with that, then you have more of a problem than anyone actually involved.

01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:04.380
So let's wrap this up.

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:24.260
I mean, they're like brothers, they drive me nuts sometimes, but I think we make amazing things.

01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:27.260
That's greater than the sum of its parts.

01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:32.780
And we've only been able to affect people in a positive way, because we are actually best friends.

01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:35.260
If we start fucking hating each other, then we should stop.

01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:39.900
I'd like to start this conclusion by once more pointing him towards the cosmopolitan interview that Ned did

01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:44.060
where he said he would move to Canada if he was ever cheated on. The other person who provided an answer

01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:48.860
in that interview was Try Guy Zack, who appeared to take a more nuanced view. If someone cheats on you early

01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:53.420
in a relationship, that's typically a deal breaker, because it could be a sign of more strife to come,

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:57.820
but it's good to hear someone else, what was the circumstance, did they get caught or admit it with remorse,

01:08:57.820 --> 01:09:03.020
and do you believe it's an isolated incident? If you haven't had the exclusive talk yet, it could be a good way

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:07.820
to open a necessary conversation to make sure both of you are on the same page, it's all about communication

01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:13.660
and making sure you're on the same page. Or I think it is, I'm single, so what do I know?

01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:18.220
Well, Zack appeared to know more than Ned, and ultimately Ned should be very grateful that his wife

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:22.860
appeared to align more with Mr. Kornfeld's point of view, that there was something worth saving,

01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:27.020
but maybe there was something worth saving for everyone, they all just needed reminding of it.

01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:30.700
And then I started to see that the Try Guys was becoming something else, that the Try Guys was

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:37.260
rigid and incapable of change, and that any attempt that I had to push against that

01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:40.620
wasn't going to work.

01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:44.700
When four men in an office decided to put on women's underwear, it would have been difficult to predict

01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:48.780
what it would lead to, yet over the span of eight years, the Try Guys had built their reputation as

01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:52.860
one of the most stable and consistent YouTube collectives with a clear and unwavering mission.

01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:57.660
Whilst other groups came and went with overwhelming transients often pulled apart by individual interests,

01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:02.620
Keith, Zack, Eugene, and Ned perfected a maturing chemistry that allowed them to grow as the quartet

01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:07.100
that many people perceived them as, acquiring more independence while maintaining a forward momentum.

01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:10.700
However, even the strongest partnerships can be subject to their own tribulations,

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:13.820
and behind the scenes restlessness appeared to be brewing amongst the members,

01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:15.980
yet few could have foreseen what it would culminate in.

01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:20.380
You and your wife seem like you have such a great relationship, and it's kind of like an internet joke

01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:25.340
how much you talk about your wife, you always bring her up in conversations and things like that,

01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:28.860
so tell us, like, what's your number one secret to a great relationship?

01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:32.540
Oh gosh.

01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:37.020
Ned, the man who was perceived as the Try Guy who put his family and those close to him above all else,

01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:41.420
designed that a months long workplace affair was the answer to whatever difficulties he was encountering.

01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:45.340
In that decision, he not only acted counter to what the Try Guys felt they represented,

01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:47.580
but also what he represented himself as.

01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:50.700
In a way, although there were many worse things one could do in a workplace,

01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:54.060
there weren't many that felt more contradictory to what they had crafted.

01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:58.220
He fell short of what they expected of him, not just as a Try Guy, but as a husband.

01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:00.540
With that in mind, the Try Guys felt they had to act.

01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:05.420
There was no easy decision, if they were to operate by the book of how to handle these situations,

01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:06.780
then they had to let him go.

01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:08.860
At the same time, he was a close friend to all,

01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:12.780
and the Try Guys would be irreparably changed in enacting that protocol.

01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:15.740
In the end, it was a decision they took, but at what cost?

01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:21.180
After a month and a half, I cracked, and I texted this to Keith and Eugene,

01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:27.340
it's like, there's so much that we can't talk about, and can't say,

01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:32.380
and I can't tell, like, you know, people are like, oh, even fucking SNL is like,

01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:34.140
oh, his bro had a little smooch.

01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:40.140
And I'm like, that's not what fucking, okay, fine, I'm just gonna keep it clamped down,

01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:43.420
I'm just gonna not say anything, I'm gonna do it right, I'm just gonna do things right.

01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:47.340
Well, in the following weeks, they were subject to a list of speculation about their own knowledge,

01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:50.860
the proportionality of their punishment, and opinions from people who do not,

01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:52.220
and will never know them.

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:55.740
Purposely distancing yourself from a long term friend can be an extremely challenging

01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:57.340
mental process for one to go through.

01:11:57.340 --> 01:12:00.780
With all this attention on them for something they would have rather kept under wraps,

01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:03.580
it must have been easy to question whether they were making the right decision,

01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:07.820
yet in time, it became apparent to them that maybe this was what they needed to move forward.

01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:11.820
When a controversy affects a group with weak relationships and weak trust like Team 10,

01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:15.180
then it can often erode the faith and confidence remaining members may possess,

01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:18.700
but in the Try Guys case, it strengthened those bonds and those relationships because they all

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:19.980
trusted that new route.

01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:23.740
If there was any sign that their decision was the right one, it's that Ned and Ariel are still

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:28.220
together, but also the fact that the remaining Try Guys are still one unit is relevant as well.

01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:31.420
Judging by certain comments, it's a fact that may not have been the case if they

01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:35.260
hadn't been given a sharp wake up call from the unquestioned success of the past decade.

01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:41.180
And I think within that we're also taking it as an opportunity to wake up from this

01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:44.140
crazy wild ride that's been the Try Guys up to this point,

01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:47.900
to re-evaluate who we are and who we want to be going forward.

01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:50.940
The Try Guys may not be renowned for making heavy duty content,

01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:55.180
they may not be perceived as reaching the same artistic heights of other more ambitious creators,

01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:59.100
but there is a timelessness about the uploads that has survived numerous shifts in the YouTube

01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:04.060
ecosystem and retained a loyal fanbase who haven't disappeared as their content lost its virality.

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:07.900
For all the provocative content one can find on YouTube, for all the shorts one can scroll

01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:11.420
through and lose hours to, there's an appeal to watching some dudes just fuck around with

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:14.940
something they've never done before. That experience of approaching something unknown

01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:19.020
for the first time is transcendent, coming out wiser and stronger, knowing better for

01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:23.500
the next time and appreciating the experience. To the Try Guys, it seemed dealing with the

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:27.420
Ned former scandal was just an extension of that, an abrupt if slightly challenging

01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:31.900
learning experience which cost them a member, but gained them a lot of perspective.

01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:35.580
What could have been the climax of their existence was just another chapter.

01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:39.420
A lot of interpretations of Keith, Eugene and Zach's handling of Ned seemed to create

01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:43.420
a much greater antagonist than the one that was actually present. The emotions that the Try Guys

01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:47.660
felt were weaponised to fulfil some twisted sense of justice and shard on Friday for the internet

01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:52.620
masses, however, I don't think they feel bitter about it or wish any further suffering from it.

01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:57.180
If anything, I think they cherish and value that 4 member era, Ned and many of the memories

01:13:57.180 --> 01:14:01.180
they created with him, and that saying goodbye to their former colleague, hard as it was,

01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:02.940
doesn't have to undermine those memories.

01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:22.060
Ned himself had something else to say, whether he truly appreciated that at the time or not,

01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:26.620
the former family needed to come first. For ages they'd been part of that Try Guy network

01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:31.100
and become taken for granted like a brand. His facade becomes so comfortable that he wore it

01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:34.700
in front of the ones he loved, and with the tearing away of their masquerade, he may have

01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:40.140
needed to confront some uncomfortable truths. If they can emerge together from that, I'm happy for them.

01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:44.620
Ned former and the Try Guys made YouTube history together, they reached milestones and created

01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:49.420
memories that will never be erased, and although their belated honeymoon era came to a very sudden

01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:53.020
end, their story didn't, and that was a testament to something greater.

01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:57.740
A statement that maybe the Try Guys weren't quite finished trying yet.

01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:11.740
And that means that we can fight and get over it. So hopefully we're brothers.

01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:24.060
Thank you for watching.

01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:46.140
So that was the video, I hope you enjoyed. I want to give a big thanks to my editors,

01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:51.020
as always, they've done a great job. My post editor, Kojak, thank you very much for your

01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:56.220
unwavering commitment to this role. The music done by John Redhunter, thank you again,

01:15:56.220 --> 01:16:00.940
it's sincerely appreciated, and the thumbnail produced by Starfo, another stellar piece,

01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:05.740
I am sure. I also want to credit the artists who've, as always, very generously lent their

01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:10.060
pieces towards being used in this content, it means a lot to me, and their credits will be

01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:13.980
in the description below, and as said in my previous video, I'm working on a new system where

01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:18.300
hopefully they'll be able to have the little sprites up as well, so you can all see their

01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:22.780
distinctive style. I also want to give a big thanks to my Patrons, $10 Patrons on screen right

01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:29.260
now, and my $50 Patrons, Hypercube, Esther Bedoya, and Seritish, thank you very much.

01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:34.860
At some point I need to sort out these YouTube member benefits as well, but that's not quite

01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:38.940
the top of the priority list right now. I'd also like to thank Incogny for sponsoring this video,

01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:43.580
thank you again, it's been a pleasure to work with you as always, and definitely check their

01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:47.740
application out, I dig it for sure. I don't know if I have too much else to say,

01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:52.860
it's getting cold up here, it's getting cold towards the winter, and I don't want to record

01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:57.420
too much beyond my capacity before I get chilly, so I'll leave you here for now,

01:16:57.420 --> 01:17:01.340
all I'll say is that I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you in the next one.
