0	17880	Hey guys, y'all know your address is online right?
17880	18880	Huh?
18880	21200	I just looked it up.
21200	23240	And why did you do that?
23240	28300	Haha yeah, so if you're in the US there are these sites where you can literally just find
28300	30180	people's information.
30180	32100	We aren't even in the US.
32100	35500	Haha yeah, we are now.
35500	40440	So you popped up to tell us our address is out there and that there is nothing we can
40440	41440	do about it.
41440	43660	You can do something about it.
43660	46160	It just comes at a price.
46160	48180	A fairly reasonable one actually.
48180	51200	It's called Incognite, the sponsor of today's video.
51200	52500	Has this ever happened to you?
52500	55680	It's Friday night, you're sitting at home alone as always.
55680	58800	It's been three weeks since you've had contact with another human being.
58800	60080	A miracle happens.
60080	61300	Your phone is ringing.
61300	62560	It's a random number.
62560	65200	This is the most excitement you've had in months.
65200	66200	You pick it up.
66200	67200	Hello?
67200	68200	John speaking, you say.
68200	69200	A voice answers back.
69200	70200	Hello, we've been trying to reach you about your car's extended warranty.
70200	71200	It's a remote call again.
71200	77560	How do they keep getting my number I hear you ask?
77560	82920	Companies known as data brokers collect your information and sell it onto whoever will
82920	83960	pay.
83960	88400	There are hundreds of data brokers making it difficult to fight them on your own.
88400	93480	Incognite will automatically contact them on your behalf to issue takedown requests
93480	96480	for your data so you don't have to.
96480	98920	If we subscribe to Incognite, will you leave?
98920	99920	Yeah.
99920	100920	Okay, great.

114060	123140	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
123140	124140	too much free time.
124140	129540	And last video I covered the bombastic yet short lived YouTube collective of Team 10.
129540	141700	If you want more on that video, you can go and watch it.
141700	144620	But ultimately their undoing was the lack of permanence they could find within their
144620	148300	members, which was exacerbated by an immature leader who drove people away, sacrificed his
148300	151820	business credibility, and served as a magnet for all sorts of drama.
151820	155740	Team 10 is an example of something that seemed bound to fall apart at any moment, he managed
155740	159260	to leave an imprint on the YouTube landscape all the same, a pair of handprints in the
159260	160580	cement before it set.
160580	163980	However, Jake Paul's Omnium Gather'em isn't the only YouTube ensemble over the
163980	167340	years to disband, as a matter of fact many more successful and long-running groups have
167340	179340	found themselves at the end of their lifespan for a plethora of reasons.
179340	183200	I'd say one of the most common reasons being that in many circumstances, the average age
183200	186420	of many creators on YouTube skews towards a much younger mean, and if you're under
186420	190660	the age of 25 or even 30, you're going to go through significant changes as an individual
190660	192440	who wants to find their purpose in life.
192440	196140	As a creator, you can evolve on your own terms, but when you have a designated role in a group,
196140	200220	the expectations imposed on you can be suffocating, and may well test your commitment to people
200220	202740	who do not necessarily share the same dreams that you do.
202740	205420	Being part of a group can often really limit your development as an individual, and may
205420	208540	also not give you the sort of compensation that you feel is appropriate for someone of
208540	211620	your ability, you want to go out into the world and fulfil your potential before you
211620	212620	settle down.
212620	216460	When people grow, they can often grow apart, however not every group feels an expectation
216460	224680	for eternal development, especially outside of YouTube.
224680	228860	This is Buzzfeed, an internet media website founded in 2016 with the goal of arbitrating
228860	231400	and disseminating online news through the use of algorithms.
231400	235040	Over the years, they expanded their project and began to hire personnel to actually publish
235040	237400	stories and add a face to their public image.
237400	240480	Buzzfeed has received a lot of criticism in its time, and it's become a bit of a sacrificial
240480	244280	lamb for the lampooning of millennial-based news, and it's purported vapidity.
244280	248200	Nonetheless, it also became extremely successful, and blossomed as social media platforms took
248200	251960	a grasp on internet climate, particularly on YouTube where algorithmic-based marketing
251960	255360	was king, and multiple channels were set up under the Buzzfeed name to reach as many
255360	257000	target demographics as possible.
257000	260740	In spite of Buzzfeed's success, YouTube also brought many new challenges regarding
260740	265080	creator-audience relationships, many of which felt like they had to be rooted in some form
265080	269360	of personality, and although Buzzfeed's topics drew viewers and platformed individuals,
269360	272340	their attention likely struggled while they tried to find a way to bridge the gap between
272340	274080	themselves and the average YouTube viewer.
274080	278200	Amongst this quandary, four unlikely heroes appeared, by the names of Eugene Lee Yang,
278200	280880	Ned Fulmer, Keith Habersberger, and Zach Kornfeld.
280880	284720	They were all Buzzfeed employees at the time who, as the only male employees prepared to,
284720	286920	decided to create a video where they tried ladies' underwear.
286920	290280	The result was somewhat unsurprising, but nonetheless interesting for people who wished
290280	292760	to observe such a scenario, and men trying it.
292760	295920	Buzzfeed had previously been experimenting with content that featured individuals trying
295920	299240	a new experience, but this one was the first one to really stick the landing.
299240	303200	There's no way for me to wear these without something popping out.
303200	304840	Maybe if I tuck it up.
304840	306840	This is why girls are always picking it out of things.
306840	309840	As individuals, the Try Guys weren't your typical YouTube assemblage.
309840	313360	They didn't start a channel together, nor were they previously overwhelmingly successful
313360	314360	online.
314360	317360	In fact, they didn't even intend to create content as a dedicated group when they started,
317360	320760	with their only other prominent credits being other content on their employer's channel.
320760	323720	But their video was well received, and in the spirit of Buzzfeed, they decided to get
323720	326000	to work to creating more content in that vein.
326000	329840	It wasn't until a few videos in which they actually adopted the Try Guys branding that
329840	333580	they are known for today, alongside a mantra that they were prepared to try anything and
333580	334580	everything.
335300	339660	I think with everything that we do, we try to show that there is no one right way to
339660	344700	be a man, to be a person, and yeah, you can still be tiny and delicate and cute and still
344700	345700	be awesome.
345700	349300	Given the unlikely story behind their formation, it seemed even more unlikely that this quartet
349300	353180	would be able to survive each other, let alone the ever-changing environment around them.
353180	356340	And yet over the years, they not only survived, but moved from strength to strength, growing
356340	359980	a significant fanbase, winning multiple awards, publishing a best-selling book, acquiring
359980	362700	their own YouTube Red series, and launching countless spin-offs.
362700	366100	With the audience established, and their image untarnished, the only significant breakup
366100	369340	occurred being their collective departure from Buzzfeed to launch their own independent
369340	373780	production company, Second Try LLC, in which they have hosted their main, and a variety
373780	374780	of other series out of.
374780	378980	The decision to go solo together also lended a lot more creative freedom for each of the
378980	382660	members to express themselves, the most notable example of this being Eugene's coming out
382660	385300	video that is amongst one of their channel's most viewed.
385300	388420	The Try Guys' apparent success as creators was rooted in that simple idea that they had
388420	392380	founded themselves on, it didn't seem particularly revolutionary, but is often underscored by
392380	395940	the timeless social message of finding out what it was like to walk in someone else's
395940	396940	shoes.
396940	399740	Their successes, colleagues, and friends, though, came down to something different.
399740	403980	As people who didn't expect at every attempt, as people who just wanted to try something,
403980	407460	there was this common bond that drew them together, using their YouTube channel to strengthen
407460	408740	their own friendships.
408740	412100	Although certain members may possess different levels of influence outside the group, when
412100	415340	the cameras rolled, you never received the impression that one member's ego outshone
415340	416340	the others.
416340	420860	However, come 2022, something would happen that would place the message promoted in their
420860	425340	interviews and their channel under question, and ultimately cause irreversible change to
425340	430020	one of the most seemingly consistent and omnipresent YouTube collectives in recent memory.
430020	432980	Maybe there were some things that shouldn't be tried.
432980	436760	Ned Fomer is no longer working with the Try Guys.
436760	442580	So friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears as we delve into the trial of the
442580	457940	Try Guys.
457940	461280	As I informed you in my introduction, the Try Guys were comprised of four members upon
461280	464460	its founding, and although none of them stood out from each other, the differences in their
464460	487160	personalities were essential to the sore play that occurred on camera.
487160	490820	You add Zack, who is the energetic, slightly mischievous one, Keith who has a warmer, more
490820	494620	traditional child about him, and also enjoys some good fried chicken, and then you have
494620	498940	Eugene, who is more biting and sardonic but still possesses a unique amount of depth,
498940	516660	and then you have Ned, the straight shooting family man.
516660	519940	A chemistry graduate from Yale, Ned Fomer wouldn't strike you as your stereotypical
519940	523920	media savvy individual, but his extracurricular activity would soon give you an impression
523920	528140	of what he was capable of.
528140	534260	A decorated comedy writer and performer in his circuit, Fomer already had his fair share
534260	537980	of experience under his belt when he was picked up by Buzzfeed as an intern, and he quickly
537980	541460	used that expertise to ascend the ranks to managing producer in the space of a year,
541460	545260	alongside founding Buzzfeed's video department with his future fellow Try Guys co-hosts.
545260	549240	However, there was more to Ned than just his career in comedy, it seems that his degree
549240	553320	was not the only thing that he had chemistry with. Yes, even in early videos, there appeared
553320	564560	to be a ring on his finger, signifying that Ned Fomer was a married man.
564560	568880	His wife was a person by the birth name Aria Wundervord, she had met him at a mutual friend's
568880	573040	birthday partly shortly after they had moved to Chicago, and they soon fell head over heels
573040	577640	for each other. In 2012, at the age of 25, Ned officially tied the knot with Ariel, and
577640	581480	settled down to the married couple's life. Unlike a lot of online personalities, Ned
581480	584840	made no secret of his marriage, and would readily talk about his relationship on the
584840	588860	Try Guys channel, garnering the reputation of the family man, who would readily bend
588860	590960	over backwards for his lifelong companion.
590960	602480	At first, the Try Guys content really only involved the four of them, with the establish
602480	606080	of their own production company and the progression of their personal lives of other members,
606080	609360	Aria and her partners found themselves more entangled in the crew's capers, especially
609360	613680	with the launch of the Tri-Wife series, which features herself, Zach's girlfriend Maggie,
613680	614880	and Keith's wife Becky.
614880	636020	However, the Tri-Wife wasn't the only person in Ned's life, and since being where
636020	640140	they had welcomed two children into the world. Once again, Ned was extremely proud to proclaim
640140	643560	this, with multiple posts on social media and uploads onto YouTube, even launching a
643560	647540	podcast with Ariel called Baby Steps, which discussed their experience with pregnancy
647540	670300	and parenting. Ned often presented himself as a voice of authority on successful relationships
670300	673860	and how to navigate them, hence the podcast. This was particularly important in the Try
673860	677660	Guys post Buzzfeed era, which sought to find a sense of depth with each of the members.
677660	682060	That was Ned's depth, but he always put his family first, and possessed very few reservations
682060	685980	about it. His relationship with the Try Guys was also defined by this, and references to
685980	689700	his family and content was frequently and seemingly central to the tasks at hand. I
689700	693460	think what made Ned unique in a way was the sense of completion with his personal life,
693460	697260	it provided a metaphorical anchor to what the Try Guys were orchestrating. Every Try
697260	701820	Guy had something to try, but Ned had something to keep, and he appeared committed to doing
701820	702820	so.
702820	707280	In 2022, the Try Guys series had been in operation for nearly 8 years, and everything seemed
707280	710900	pretty settled. Sure, they weren't pulling the significant viewing numbers they did at
710900	714660	the peak of their popularity, but they seemed to understand that and already sought to diversify
714660	718420	their revenue streams, with everything from a clothing line to a chicken sauce. The Try
718420	722140	Guys appeared to have navigated the challenge of outgrowing each other by unshackling themselves
722140	725900	from any constraints, and having an equal power share with their new company. That was
725900	729480	a gesture of trust that could not be ignored. Outside of the new relationship they sought
729480	732920	to craft their audience, there was also a new business side to their operations, and
732920	736280	this incurred a new sense of responsibility on each of the members, who all hailed the
736280	740880	title of Executive Producer at Second Try LLC. They all own shared and recruited a full
740880	744880	team of employees, something that is never a straightforward process. Nevertheless, in
744880	747940	interviews, what claimed matter most of them was that they were in control of their careers
747940	751960	and their images, something that they were never able to completely fulfil while working
751960	755840	under Buzzfeed. They were the masters of their own destiny.
755840	758880	The thrill of being able to operate your own company and not having to answer to anyone
758920	762760	is pretty unmatched. It allowed each Try Guy to pursue their own personal and group interests
762760	766240	without the constraints of a parent company, or even a reliance on a singular platform.
766240	769840	At the same time, there are a lot of external pressures that being your own boss may impose
769840	773960	on you. The Try Guys had to navigate them, and required the input of all members to do
773960	777760	so, but for years running their own business and everything appeared to be going swimmingly,
777760	781080	until some keen observers began to spot the absence of one of their members.
782080	787080	Hands up, bakers! Nailed it! I'm f***ing crushed here, guys.
787080	789480	Where could our resident family man be?
802480	806440	The Try Guys have a pretty consistent upload schedule and motif in general, so devoted
806440	810280	fans were normally quite quick to pick up if something was different or something has
810280	813440	changed, particularly if a member is absent from the videos. When Eugene took a break
813440	817320	in 2021 from the Try Guys, people were fast to pick up on it, and explained it to other
817320	821680	confused viewers. So in September 2022, when a video was published onto the Try Guys channel
821680	825600	without founding member Ned Former, although nobody raised an alarm, people definitely
825600	828320	took notice, particularly with what some knew already.
828320	842120	It all started on the first of the month, when a fan ran into Ned at New York City,
842120	846120	while he was with a producer at a concert. They posted a pitch with Ned, but not the
846120	849280	producer, and noted that they seemed annoyed that they were recognised. It was soon revealed
849280	852200	there were other people from the production team at the concert, and therefore nothing
852200	856040	seemed particularly out of the ordinary. However, less than a couple days after, other posts
856040	859720	appeared to indicate that something untoward was occurring, with images shared that showed
859720	864120	a person appearing to be Ned making out with this aforementioned producer. The account
864120	867340	sharing many of these details later claimed in the messages that they were the producers
867340	871160	then fiance. Certainly a curious piece of information to share, and it seemed a bit
871160	875240	bizarre that they would take to Reddit over it, but fans compared and included that physical
875240	880100	profiles matched up with the individuals suggested. With that noted, there was probably more concern
880100	884080	than usual when Ned ceased to appear on the Try Guys videos in their podcast. This was
884080	887680	clearly something unforeseen at least, although a variety of explanations were still on the
887680	891120	table, and it was possible that the Try Guys were merely taking precautionary measures
891120	894440	while investigating the claims more thoroughly. Although no public statements were released
894440	898480	in this time, the Try Guys schedule was visibly disrupted, with apologies being posted onto
898480	902160	their Patreon, with Zant letting slip that he wasn't doing so great in a podcast episode.
902160	909440	Zant- When I tell you that, I've had a rough week, and this has been such a salve.
910280	913800	This was all circumstantial and hearsay though, with a plethora of potential explanations
913800	917640	for why this was the case. Over time though, further information began to indicate that
917640	921520	this was something being taken a little more permanently. On the Try Guys channel, Ned
921520	925480	was being edited out of the intro featuring new merch, and some eagle eyed viewers began
925480	929280	to pick up on slight discrepancies in videos, including points where it appeared to have
929280	932760	been edited out of recorded footage. This didn't seem like the sort of decisions where
932760	936820	a person was merely on an optional hiatus, this appeared to be a preparation for something
936820	941540	much, much worse. And on September the 26th, the rumours that Ned Fulmer had boldly tried
941540	945540	an affair with a co-worker while in a committed marriage began to make the rounds outside
945540	949780	of dedicated fan circles, with more people weighing in online and analysing the content
949780	954500	available. In addition, a former Second Try employee who had recently left posted a TikTok
954500	956140	that appeared to confirm the rumours.
956140	962420	Zant- You ruined everything, you stupid bitch.
962420	966260	At this stage, nothing had been certified by the party, but everything appeared to be
966260	970140	adding up regarding his sudden airbrushing from the Try Guys content, and apprehending
970140	974280	that the news was about to break, on the 27th of September, the Try Guys released a short
974280	978140	statement on social media informing all that an internal review had been conducted and
978140	981620	that Ned had been removed from the Try Guys roster, as they did not see a way forward
981620	985140	with him. The same day, Ned released a statement onto Twitter and Instagram which confirmed
985140	988560	the rumours regarding the reason behind this. He states that family should have been his
988560	993340	priority but he ultimately lost focus and partook in a consensual, I'd hope so, workplace
993340	997260	relationship. He apologises for any pain that he has caused to everyone affected, especially
997260	1000900	Ariel who he pledges commitment following the scandal. This statement in particular
1000900	1004780	was not well received, and many people proceeded to dunk on him, even starting a meme trend
1004780	1008820	where Ned's selectively used letters from his statement to create a new comment or message,
1008820	1012380	so at least something creative came out of it. It is a bit of a strange statement, every
1012380	1015540	word seems rather contrived, and although I'm sure people are pleased that it was
1015540	1019580	a consensual relationship, I don't think they were assuming otherwise, so Ned's phrasing
1019580	1022420	seems strangely defensive in light of that.
1022420	1025500	Ariel also released a statement onto Instagram thanking those who had reached out to her
1025500	1028900	but requesting privacy for the sake of her children, emphasizing that nothing was more
1028900	1032900	important to the couple. In the space of a day, all directly involved parties with a
1032900	1036660	public presence had released their own statements, amplifying the story significantly, and on
1036660	1039740	hand to further share the story was the ever reliable media.
1039740	1043500	If you're on any form of social media, then by now you must have heard of the huge scandal
1043500	1044940	involving Ned from the Try Guys.
1044940	1048180	Over the following week, a series of articles were published which reflected on the sudden
1048180	1052540	revelations and people's responses to it, including ironically from Buzzfeed themselves.
1052540	1055740	Some former co-workers appeared to react with indifference, implying that this news was
1055740	1060780	not exactly surprising to them. As expected, analysis of past content began as well, including
1060780	1064360	an interview where Ned states that if he was ever cheated on he'd probably moved to Canada,
1064360	1067540	and that it was the ultimate deal breaker in a relationship, alongside other claims
1067540	1071260	he had made advances elsewhere. Questions were asked about how long this had gone on
1071260	1075020	for, whether there were more people, with the sorts of reactions coming from any sources,
1075020	1078460	this sort of hypothesis was rife amongst internet communities. It was clearly blowing
1078460	1081700	up faster than anticipated, and questions were beginning to circulate regarding the
1081700	1085220	Try Guys' own knowledge of the matter, and their potential complicity in a cover-up
1085220	1089740	of this workplace affair. Such behaviour would be counter-intuitive to what their brand exemplified
1089740	1093500	and could seriously affect their operations. By this point, the Try Guys had to disclose
1093500	1097420	too much information outside of their statements, and people didn't necessarily have a right
1097420	1101820	to speculate, but that's what people on the internet do, and without further information
1101820	1104140	such theories were going to continue to churn away.
1104700	1109980	Ned Fomer is no longer working with the Try Guys. By now, we're assuming you've seen
1109980	1114460	the Reddit threads, and TikToks, and tweets, and news articles.
1114460	1116060	They needed to clear the air.
1121060	1125460	On October 3rd, the Try Guys released a video entitled What Happened? As one can likely
1125460	1128680	predict, this is a video which attempts to clarify information that have been speculated
1128680	1133660	about on a variety of media platforms by providing a linear chronological timeline of their handling
1133700	1137340	of the suspension of their former colleague. The video has them sitting on a couch, directly
1137340	1141020	facing the camera, and the information is delivered in a uniform manner, with each of
1141020	1144660	the Try Guys taking turns to explain parts of the process, likely to emphasise that this
1144660	1146060	was a collective decision.
1146060	1151380	Throughout this video, there will be things that we want to say or go into further, but
1151380	1155560	as I'm sure you're aware, there are some legal issues we have to consider as we go
1155560	1157080	through everything.
1157080	1160360	They state that they had been alerted to this information on Labor Day by fans who had seen
1160360	1163740	Ned Forman engaging romantically with an employee of the company, and had confirmed
1163740	1166920	these allegations and conceded that it had been going on for a while, which the Try Guys
1166920	1170280	found rather surprising, affirming that they had no idea about this effect.
1170280	1174440	All of that information was just as shocking to us as all of this has been for you this
1174440	1175440	week.
1175440	1178480	After this, they conducted a thorough three week internal review which would seek to ascertain
1178480	1182160	all the facts of the situation, once again with Eugene stressing how serious the situation
1182160	1184980	was to the rest of his team, and rebusting rumours that they may have turned a blind
1184980	1186740	eye at any point.
1186740	1192060	This is something we took very seriously.
1192060	1195460	We refused to sweep things under the rug.
1195460	1199140	That is not who we are, and it's not what we stand for.
1199140	1202860	They state their process was not just internal, as they reassessed the media they released
1202860	1206260	in that time, confirming rumours that they had been digitally removing Ned from their
1206260	1209780	content, and omitting sections which involved him altogether, as well as stating there were
1209780	1212020	certain videos that were too tainted for release.
1212020	1215660	There are several videos that we've deemed as fully unreleasable, you will never see
1215660	1219940	them, and that is due to his involvement, and that's a decision that has cost us lots
1219940	1220940	of money.
1220940	1225180	We will not be able to recoup that money, but it's a decision we stand by proudly.
1225180	1228380	The review drew to a close with the conclusion that the only reasonable solution in this
1228380	1232500	case was to ultimately remove Ned from the company as a manager and employee, something
1232500	1236820	which the three remaining members did on September 16th, just over ten days before the story
1236820	1238000	broke publicly.
1238000	1241220	They arrived reasoning for not releasing a public statement immediately, wishing to protect
1241220	1246100	the privacy of people involved, and avoiding causing additional stress onto affected parties.
1246100	1251460	So on Friday, September 16th, the three of us signed written consent of the members of
1251460	1257740	Second Try LLC approving the removal of Ned as a manager and employee, and while we consider
1257740	1263420	this a company matter, there's just also a family at the centre of this.
1263420	1266900	They then talk about the actual personal toll it's taken on them, and those around them,
1266900	1271140	requesting respect and space for any people caught up in the blast radius of such a spectacle.
1272060	1277140	Look, I get that when stuff like this happens, there's going to be speculation and gossip,
1277140	1281320	and we ask that you respect the privacy of the family members and employees who may be
1281320	1282320	caught up in this.
1282320	1286060	There are a few more notes that I might save for later, but the general message is that
1286060	1289100	they had no knowledge of this happening prior to fans communicating this with them, and
1289100	1292300	that once they were informed, they acted as swiftly and efficiently as they could, and
1292300	1295580	took an action that was obviously difficult for them, but they felt was necessary.
1295580	1298500	They stand by their response, and intend to move forward after they have provided a more
1298500	1299980	comprehensive statement.
1299980	1303860	This finishes the video, which appears to be at least a response to end certain roots
1303860	1304980	of speculation.
1304980	1308620	All the Try Guys appear rather worn down in the release, with many noting Eugene's apparent
1308620	1313060	anger, Keith's disgust, and Zack's upset, but all share this tone of clear annoyance
1313060	1315180	that the situation had reached this stage.
1315180	1318700	The response to this video was generally supportive from many viewers, particularly those who
1318700	1322100	were fans of the Try Guys, felt that this was a respectful and in-depth response that
1322100	1323300	dispelled the rumours.
1323300	1325980	Although they don't necessarily provide any evidence for this video, the timeline
1325980	1328800	made sense given the information available at that time.
1328800	1332320	Anyone involved who did speak on the matter appeared to corroborate what the Try Guys
1332320	1333320	said.
1333320	1336100	Nonetheless, there were a couple interesting pieces of information that cropped up shortly
1336100	1337300	after the video went live.
1337300	1339640	When you knew Ned was cheating in May...
1339640	1359720	The first was a TikTok posted on October 5th which allegedly showed Ned in a Burbank restaurant
1359720	1363060	with his producer in May, confirming what the Try Guys said about this relationship
1363060	1364420	occurring for a while.
1364420	1368060	This also substantiates earlier images that had been taken around May time which featured
1368060	1369060	the two together.
1369080	1372400	The person who posted this claimed to have messaged Ariel about this interaction back
1372400	1374040	then, but hadn't received a response.
1374040	1377280	The producer's fiancé responds to this TikTok stating that he wished he'd been
1377280	1380900	told, but given that TikTok unlikely didn't know the identity of the person Ned was seated
1380900	1382900	with, it wouldn't have been possible.
1382900	1385920	Not to soon after, a former Buzzfeed employee stated that they had personally had a large
1385920	1389000	falling out with Ned a few years prior, and stated that people at the workplace would
1389000	1392640	have a running joke that there were different Neds for different days, and he was notoriously
1392640	1396640	duplicitous, though he was apparently shocked by the brazenness of his actions of recent,
1396660	1400180	and implies that he expected more discretion from a hyper-competitive Yale graduate.
1400180	1403100	Although none of this information appeared to contradict what the Try Guys had shared
1403100	1407180	in their video, it did provide new angles to Ned and the history he held with his past
1407180	1408180	companies.
1408180	1412580	What we hope is that within this, there's also the opportunity for positive growth and
1412580	1416340	better videos ahead, but it's going to be hard.
1416340	1418820	This whole thing is going to be really fucking hard.
1418820	1422260	Although their video did set the record straight and away, their rather serious tone, whether
1422260	1427220	caused by fatigue or desire to show solidarity with affected parties, stressed gravitas and
1427220	1429480	naturally drew the media back into the fray.
1429480	1432840	In the next few days, many articles were published retelling the story of the Try Guys, and their
1432840	1433840	present drama.
1433840	1437160	Most of these stories didn't bring many new details to the table, but more served
1437160	1441880	as an accessibility ramp for those not versed in the drama as it transpired.
1441880	1445200	Emotions and tensions still remained somewhat high, stories were still coming from many
1445200	1449180	high profile news websites, more publicity than many far more controversial individuals
1449180	1450180	have received.
1450180	1453740	There had to be some way to control the fever that appeared to grasp people, and their interest
1453740	1457140	in a situation that the Try Guys would never have wanted in the first place.
1457140	1460820	Well, they did mention in their video that they had a longer statement to release, and
1460820	1462700	a few days after, they released it.
1470660	1473660	The Try Guys were at a bit of a crossroads, there was clearly a lot of information they
1473660	1477260	wanted to share their side on, but they also wanted to move past this torrent of media
1477260	1479460	attention as soon as possible.
1479460	1482300	They could wait for a bit for the coverage to die down, but then they'd potentially
1482300	1485340	be prolonging the drama, and who was to know that it wouldn't just re-emerge as soon
1485340	1486620	as they opened their mouths?
1486620	1490500	They needed something conclusive that also didn't provide more questions than it answers.
1490500	1491820	How are they going to do that?
1491820	1492820	Well.
1492820	1497380	We're four best friends who try stuff, we have a YouTube channel together, we happen
1497380	1502120	to live particularly insane lives, especially right now, and so this podcast is a chance
1502120	1506180	for us to hang out every week, talk, catch up, and just let you know what we're thinking
1506180	1507180	about.
1507220	1510700	One of the main adventures the Try Guys had embarked on upon leaving Buzzfeed was a podcast
1510700	1511700	called The Tripod.
1511700	1515340	At first, it involved all four members sitting down and talking about whatever was on their
1515340	1517260	mind in a less contrived environment.
1517260	1521220	Over time, though, Eugene appeared less, and three others appeared to take the reins, alongside
1521220	1522760	podcast producer Miles.
1522760	1526260	With Ned's unilateral withdrawal from the Try Guys and all affiliated media, there was
1526260	1530100	going to be a readjustment required for the podcast format, which originally had him sitting
1530100	1531100	next to Keith.
1531100	1535300	However, the Try Guys also saw an opportunity to use this up people as a way to make a more
1535300	1536300	official statement.
1536300	1540080	I use official in quotation marks here, because it's probably one of the most unofficial
1540080	1543900	official statements in recent corporate history, but it did kinda make sense.
1543900	1544900	Ned- Shall we?
1544900	1545900	Eugene- Go for it, man.
1545900	1546900	Ned- Okay.
1546900	1547900	Eugene- Well, here we are, everyone.
1547900	1552460	Ned- Welcome to the Try Pod to all of our normal listeners and no new people whatsoever.
1552460	1555320	When you first look at the video length of over an hour, you wouldn't be amiss for
1555320	1559180	perhaps being a bit concerned that this may feel like overkill, however the runtime is
1559180	1562780	aesthetically justified by a more relaxed environment that doesn't necessarily possess
1562780	1565060	the tension their previous video statement did.
1565060	1569060	As fans Eugene, Keith and Zack are provided emotional support from Mars, as they recount
1569060	1572780	the incident to the process and go into more depth on their own feelings regarding it all.
1572780	1576820	Keith- We knew that this would be big to our fans and people who had watched us in the
1576820	1580180	past, but I had no idea it would be this.
1580180	1586120	Zach- The New York Times, NPR, Rolling Stone, I mean these are publications that are huge
1586120	1590580	and we never thought would be concerned with us, and now certainly some of them are, who
1590580	1597140	are these guys and why does everyone care articles, but it showed that we had a really
1597140	1598700	big effect on a lot of people.
1598700	1603180	Keith- As we're talking, my family just sent me another Rolling Stone article that came
1603180	1604180	out an hour ago.
1604180	1607620	While the recurring themes from this video is that they really did not anticipate it
1607620	1611260	blowing up in the way that it did, and although they always intended to sack him, if they'd
1611260	1614580	had the choice, they would have done it a lot more quietly to avoid the sort of volatile
1614580	1618340	public reaction that a lot of parties involved have received, something that has taken a
1618340	1619340	toll on them all.
1619740	1622420	Zach- Have you ever thought that stress does not manifest physically?
1622420	1631300	Let me tell you, my back hurts, my BM's have been wild, the stress poops have been out
1631300	1638100	of control, have not been sleeping, and part of that is because there's just been so much
1638100	1639100	to do.
1639100	1642740	They remained steadfast in the narrative regarding how much they knew, stating that being contacted
1642740	1646340	by fans was the first time they had heard about it, and they moved as quickly as possible
1646340	1647580	to form an internal review.
1647580	1651260	A majority of the credit to handling this situation is given to Zach, who is the person
1651260	1655180	said to have overseen the operation that led to the removal of Ned from Second Tryer LLC,
1655180	1656880	given that Keith was on tour.
1656880	1660100	They say the secrecy wasn't exclusive to the public, and they couldn't even disclose
1660100	1664280	details of Ned's suspension to fellow employees, although they were pretty fast to deduce exactly
1664280	1665420	what had occurred.
1665420	1668940	With mind to the fact that this information had been uncovered by fans first, they intended
1668940	1672440	to wait until speculation had passed before releasing a statement, which explains why
1672440	1674700	they hadn't released one immediately upon Ned's dismissal.
1674700	1680740	So to be clear, however this went down, we would have taken the same action.
1680740	1686380	But the fact that it was something that was caught by fans, that it was a transgression
1686380	1691540	that was enacted publicly, added a level of complication to this, where we knew there
1691540	1695360	was this stick of dynamite with an uncertain fuse.
1695360	1701520	You have to really have things in line to legally be able to say some things.
1701520	1706560	And even then, also, you're not just doing things out of fear of legal action, you're
1706560	1712080	doing things out of fear of public backlash to other parties involved.
1712080	1716380	So you're really trying, like, I don't want people who are hurt to become more hurt,
1716380	1722520	I don't want to do something wrong and get sued and further jeopardise the company and
1722520	1723520	people's jobs.
1723520	1726680	In the original video statement, they're afraid to make any character judgements towards
1726680	1727680	their former colleague.
1727680	1731280	In the podcast, they still play their cards relative close to their chest, but there are
1731280	1734440	the occasional moments where they let some emotion surface, especially when clearing
1734440	1738960	up speculation, there seems to be an air of disdain for Ned and his handling of the situation.
1738960	1746240	No, we shared what our statement was going to be, we did not have insight into what his
1746240	1747480	statement was.
1747480	1752000	I also want to say that we did not coordinate fonts, I believe that he saw ours and copied
1752000	1753000	it.
1753000	1754000	That is our opinion.
1754000	1756680	And it is an opinion that I'm not happy about.
1756680	1764360	When I saw that, I'm like, you got to choose the same font that made it look like we wrote
1764360	1765360	your...
1765360	1768960	It's my opinion that that was on purpose.
1768960	1773760	That was too optimised result for him.
1773760	1774760	That's my opinion.
1774760	1777320	Additionally, there's an interesting clip towards the end where Keith begins to talk
1777320	1781060	about the sentiment of betrayal, before Zach cuts it back to a more detached perspective
1781060	1782360	of the matter.
1782360	1787760	Keith, final one here is if this hadn't gone public, was there a world where Ned came back
1787760	1789080	and was a cast member?
1789080	1790080	No.
1790080	1791080	No.
1791080	1792080	Yeah.
1792080	1793080	And maybe speak to why.
1793080	1794080	No.
1794080	1799620	Look, what happened, it betrayed our trust.
1799620	1801160	And it was a workplace violation.
1801160	1803160	It was a workplace violation.
1803160	1808000	It would mean to all the people in our office who knew what they knew, they would know that
1808000	1812960	we were in the face of everything like not being true to who we say we are in our values.
1812960	1815440	So like, very simply, he would have been removed.
1815440	1818560	There's a sense that even if they were to speak openly about their emotions, they're
1818560	1822480	aware of the possible implications of riling up fans and viewers, some that they also speak
1822480	1826240	about, emphasizing that people mess up and don't necessarily deserve death threats,
1826240	1828800	although they do exclude Ned from this narrative.
1828800	1830720	It's just like really, really scary.
1830720	1836160	Like to get, you know, I'm sure that their DMs are full of crazy messages and just feel
1836160	1842620	it's, it can make you feel really like no one in the world likes you anymore.
1842620	1843620	And that can be hard.
1843620	1845880	I know for a fact that people have received death threats because of this.
1845880	1852040	I know that people, you know, their past has been dredged up and they, look, a bad thing
1852040	1856560	happened and we reacted accordingly and did what we had to do.
1856560	1860120	Actions have repercussions, but...
1860120	1862360	It would be a lot for the strongest person to handle.
1862560	1866640	As an episode of the podcast that seeks to find the balance between explaining the situation
1866640	1870120	without provoking it, they seem to do a fair job, and they clear up some misconceptions,
1870120	1873680	but there was one more matter they needed to discuss, which wasn't covered in their
1873680	1875680	original response video.
1875680	1877680	That being, what now?
1877680	1879560	I don't know.
1879560	1887040	I think if this didn't happen, there is a world in which the Try Guys cast, you know,
1887040	1889960	like how do I want to say this?
1890240	1898360	For the last two years, frankly, I've kind of personally gone through this mental process
1898360	1906640	of acceptance, of realising that where I want to grow and what the Try Guys is are different.
1906640	1909840	There have been a lot of speculations as to whether there would be a new Try Guy, including
1909840	1912240	from the roster of people they currently collaborated with.
1912240	1915240	Keith and Zack confirmed that this is not happening, and that the Try Guys that people
1915240	1918840	had come to know would no longer exist, and although the situation had been exhausting
1918880	1922920	and distressing, they did see an opportunity within the tragedy to move forward.
1922920	1926520	Zack in particular expresses this idea that the Try Guys had become rather rigid, and
1926520	1929200	incapable of the sort of growth that he desired from life.
1929200	1933120	These circumstances, albeit unfortunate, allowed them to reassess how they wanted to develop
1933120	1935240	as a collective and individuals.
1935240	1940320	And sometimes like a good laugh is a relief and a piece of content that you need, but
1940320	1948760	more and more we are going to allow the Try Guys to grow with us, to adapt as we adapt,
1948760	1954000	and to bring in new creative people like Kwesi, like a myriad of people you know on
1954000	1958680	this channel, and allow them that opportunity to make stuff that's deeply important to
1958680	1959680	them.
1959680	1960680	And that's that.
1960680	1964000	It seems that the controversy in the subsequent coverage had tainted the Try Guys' name
1964000	1967840	in their mind, and that was not easy for people who had built their brand around that, but
1967840	1971720	maybe it had also been holding them back, and this was something, finally, that could
1971720	1972720	propel them forward.
1972720	1983000	The Try Guys' second statement appeared to satisfy most of social media and the mainstream
1983000	1986400	media in explaining what transpired and their plans to move forward from it.
1986400	1989840	It was good to have a response that grasped the scope of the situation while not necessarily
1989840	1991860	dramatising or downplaying it.
1991860	1995200	This seemed to be a good point for all to draw the line under the situation, but little
1995200	1997480	did they know, the narrative was soon going to shift.
1997480	2002280	It would not have been this public spectacle, we probably would have tried to avoid that
2002280	2007200	for the sake of the other people involved, but it happened how it happened.
2007200	2010680	At multiple points in the podcast, Keith and Zach's threats they did not expect, nor
2010680	2013920	did they want the situation to blow up like it has, and they were very upset about the
2013920	2016800	speculation and involvement from external parties.
2016800	2019960	There was this sense that people needed to step back and remember that although this
2019960	2023480	was obviously emotionally effective for some people, there also needed to be a sense of
2023480	2024480	perspective.
2024480	2026400	Who was going to provide that perspective though?
2026400	2031400	Alright, well, let's take a look at our final Jeopardy category, Lives That Matter.
2031400	2039560	Well, it was good while it lasted though.
2039560	2043240	This is Saturday Night Live, a comedy sketch show that has become a mainstay of late night
2043240	2044240	TV.
2044240	2046760	It has gradually evolved with the media and political landscape, and has persisted to
2046760	2049620	stay relevant with an array of guest stars and performing acts.
2049620	2052960	Despite pulling sizeable view counts, younger generations haven't exactly taken to its
2052960	2056960	brand of heavy-handed and often cringe-inducing humour, especially given that their sketches
2056960	2060400	often focus on topics that older audiences buy more affinity with.
2060400	2063940	So it may have come as a surprise to viewers, when out of all the internet dramas one could
2063940	2080160	potentially satirise, SNL decided to produce a sketch about the Try Guys, featuring high-profile
2080160	2083800	Oscar-nominated actor Brendan Gleeson, who I'm sure is chuffed to be a part of this
2083800	2085120	slice of internet history.
2085120	2089080	The sketch follows a news anchor who is attempting to report on the latest current affairs, but
2089080	2092360	is continuously interrupted by their field correspondent who wishes to report on the
2092360	2093360	Try Guys drama.
2093360	2118480	The
2118480	2122120	sketch also references the Try Guys original response video, which features caricatures
2122120	2126000	of the cast members, who also avidly interrupt the news to try and make the situation about
2126000	2130000	them, which derails the news bulletin entirely with the anchor's voice of reason being
2130000	2156120	drowned out.
2156120	2159600	In spite of the laugh tracks, many viewers did not see the funny side of this, especially
2159600	2163240	when they felt SNL had missed the point of the situation, with many referring to SNL's
2163240	2166760	past on-set controversies as consistent with the message of this sketch.
2166760	2170040	The sketch's message appears at first to be lampooning the media's response, but
2170040	2173280	quickly sets their sights on the Try Guys themselves, and what they perceive to be their
2173280	2176840	over-dramatic handling of the video, whilst still ignoring the follow-up response from
2176840	2177840	Zach and Keith.
2177840	2181020	Amongst dedicated fans, theories spread that Ned's background in comedy was allowing
2181020	2185040	him to pull some strings to hit back without attaching his name to it, and many refer to
2185040	2188200	clips where Ned had spoken about having ties to SNL.
2188200	2191060	Interestingly enough, on the same podcast episode, the producer that he had cheated
2191060	2210000	on his wife with also spoke about their connections on the show.
2210000	2213520	This was obviously completely conjectural, but was also a potential explanation for why
2213520	2217440	SNL decided to dip their toes in YouTube drama at this specific time.
2217440	2220720	Many collaborates with the Try Guys mostly made the case for them on social media, while
2220720	2224280	the Try Guys themselves moreover attempted to say as little as possible, or at least
2224280	2225880	see the funny side of it.
2225880	2229240	Nevertheless, this trust was appearing to get the better of some members, as Zach in
2229240	2233080	particular ended up in a spat with Dream, something that he felt was the result of the
2233080	2237240	past few weeks, and the inability to talk about details that he felt had been misrepresented
2237240	2238240	in the media.
2238240	2263560	It also appeared to be causing tension between audience members and people who were associated
2263560	2265040	with any critical content.
2265040	2268960	It was also reported that, in a short Instagram Live section, Bowen Yang, who played Eugene
2268960	2272640	in the SNL sketch, spoke briefly about the subsequent backlash, stating that they may
2272640	2276320	have misunderstood how it all played out, but also felt that people who were not involved
2276320	2279600	with the piece were being implicated, and that this was simply not the case.
2279600	2283840	He also felt the Try Guys had incited audience members to attack them as their podcast account
2283840	2286360	had received rather significant levels of harassment.
2286360	2290320	There is no evidence of any direct incitement, but it seems like emotion still ran high within
2290320	2293840	the Try Guys and their audience, particularly in how they are responding to a decision that
2293840	2295680	would be emotional for a lot of people.
2295680	2299600	Nonetheless, poorly received by many as it was, the SNL sketch did represent a sect of
2299600	2303920	the online populace that didn't really understand why what the Try Guys did had to be such a
2303920	2308120	monumental decision, and that although acknowledging what Ned did was wrong, didn't feel that
2308120	2312280	he should be spoken about and treated in such a way, a way that to them provoked the worst
2312280	2315960	of the internet to launch a very emotionally charged response to anybody involved.
2316400	2323240	We have prided ourselves for the last eight years on being undramatic boys, and I cannot
2323240	2324640	wait to go back there.
2324640	2327920	Although the Try Guys seem to have quashed concerns regarding their knowledge of Ned
2327920	2331720	Fulmer's infidelity, or the concern that they did not act quickly or take it seriously
2331720	2335640	enough, a new narrative was being raised by the media, as to whether they had overcorrected
2335640	2339320	and caused people to feel too invested in a situation that was ultimately not their
2339320	2340320	business.
2340320	2344200	It really looked like the Try Guys couldn't win, no matter how hard they tried.
2345960	2358560	The truth was that the Try Guys were placed in a very awkward position, because on one
2358560	2362040	hand they wanted to clear up these misconceptions, but on the other they were deeply aware of
2362040	2365640	the possible legal ramifications of doing so, which allowed people who weren't necessarily
2365640	2369200	confined by those chains to speculate, and if the Try Guys attempted to respond, there
2369200	2373320	were concerns of harassment given how deeply invested many people were in this drama.
2373320	2397600	Most of the time they were bound to silence, but some felt that this was their own doing.
2397600	2401360	Towards the end of October, once again the media decided to take advantage of this silence,
2401360	2404760	this time in the form of a more academic think piece from the New York Times, a paper
2404760	2408800	that had previously published and updated an article following the Try Guys drama, something
2408800	2410200	they covered from the jump.
2410200	2413880	Their article this time, The Try Guys and the Prison of Online Fame, approaches the
2413880	2417440	matter from a more philosophical standpoint, and seeks to explain the Try Guys' response
2417440	2421800	from the perspective of fan appeasement, describing their first response as resembling a hostage
2421800	2426520	video and their supposed outrage as a performance, attempting to calm the nerds of distrustful
2426520	2427720	and anxious fans.
2427720	2431080	The author acknowledges the power dynamics, but still questions why the Try Guys spoke
2431120	2435640	about Ned like he was John Wayne Gacy, ultimately concluding that there likely was this understanding
2435640	2439200	from the Try Guys that it wasn't that big a deal, but that they acted more out of threat
2439200	2441120	of losing audience than anything else.
2441120	2445080	Beer's response to this was similarly hostile, with many audiences stating that this sought
2445080	2448640	to downplay a serious situation, but the author of the article would probably state that these
2448640	2452680	are the people that the Try Guys were seeking to appease, so there would be little movement
2452680	2453880	in that discourse.
2453880	2457880	Keith's wife responded to this article expressing annoyance at its existence, but otherwise
2457880	2461240	there wasn't a matter response, and the article did accrue a fair amount of twitter
2461240	2463720	likes, so that's some metric I suppose.
2463720	2467460	The media continued to loiter around the situation for a bit, playing with narratives that often
2467460	2470640	surrounded business, but all in all there was silence for a while.
2470640	2474240	The Try Guys did not want to be caught defending their decisions forever, and they likely knew
2474240	2475480	that they had to move on.
2475480	2478800	In the coming weeks they appeared to do this, the producer appeared to remove any credits
2478800	2482040	of her involvement with the Try Guys, and the Try Guys stopped crediting her in video
2482040	2485680	descriptions, implying a mutual agreement for her departure had also been reached.
2485680	2489400	Ned was also gradually edited and written out, where possible, the title card for their
2489400	2493520	new season of their show Without A Recipe was subtitled Everything Is Fine, a totally
2493520	2497440	normal season, and Ned who appeared in episodes that were recorded before his suspension was
2497440	2499320	now replaced with an animated elephant.
2499320	2503560	They also edited old thumbnails of Without A Recipe to exclude Ned, likely anticipating
2503560	2507560	the release of the show, and would intend to disassociate him from the series as a whole,
2507560	2510760	especially given that it was one of the series they were promoting through a more commercial
2510760	2511760	platform, Kizwii.
2511760	2515040	However, with this in mind, they had to move back towards promotional work eventually,
2515080	2518680	part of their channel required them to exist in the public sphere, and although it felt
2518680	2522280	like people's interest in the subject had waned in the weeks prior, it also didn't
2522280	2524240	feel like they'd fully moved on from it.
2524240	2526160	What steps were they going to take to ensure that?
2526160	2530600	Well the first was an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, where Habersberger, Yang, and Kornfeld
2530600	2533760	talk about their plans to move forward from the scandal of the past few months.
2533760	2536880	They talk about their upcoming projects, in particular Without A Recipe, state that they
2536880	2540560	intend to remain as the Try Guys, but also that they intend to move away from the viral
2540560	2544320	content that made them popular, and towards broadcast TV, as they feel they can work on
2544320	2548160	more ambitious projects and invest more resources, something they've probably felt constrained
2548160	2549160	by in the past.
2549160	2552800	YG- Can I plant an idea in your head, guys?
2552800	2559320	YG- Please, just consider it, I think it's a real good option.
2559320	2563200	The first few questions go by pretty likely, but then Eugene chimes in to discuss the media
2563200	2567040	coverage of the issue, talking about how they had presented the Try Guys as a happy-go-lucky
2567040	2570580	troupe to contrast that image against the drama, and pointing out that they had readily
2570580	2574460	tackled many more serious and sobering topics, ones that people who didn't merely take a
2574460	2576100	cursory glance would have known.
2576100	2579020	He aligns their handling of these subjects with their response, and states that other
2579020	2583460	workplaces with more traditional values simply aren't as upfront, and he's proud of the team's
2583460	2585100	reaction to what transpired.
2585100	2588240	They talk about upcoming projects such as Kees' Off-Broadway show with a general tone
2588240	2592180	of optimism, and that reiterates what he said in the podcast episode, this was the best
2592180	2596040	outcome for them, calling it an evolution point, and not too soon after they decide
2596040	2597540	to start that evolution.
2598540	2601940	Well, what a year it's been!
2601940	2602940	F*** yeah.
2602940	2607860	On the 17th of December, the Try Guys uploaded a video titled What Happens Next, sat down
2607860	2610540	on the couch once more, reminiscent of their first video.
2610540	2614180	This time, they appear to be in much higher spirits, though they do have some pretty significant
2614180	2615500	announcements to make.
2616500	2620600	Look, that era of the Try Guys is officially over.
2620600	2625000	It was an incredible, once in a lifetime ride, and we really, truly, honestly cannot thank
2625000	2626900	you enough for being a part of it.
2627900	2637580	But, with happy endings comes the opportunity for happier beginnings, and as the Try Guys,
2637580	2639580	we're just getting started.
2642180	2645700	Although they state that this era of the Try Guys will be coming to an end, they also set
2645700	2649540	forth their plans for the coming year, including multiple projects that will be more ambitious
2649540	2653720	and high production, also using this upload as a preview for their interactive live finale
2653720	2654980	of Without A Recipe.
2655940	2659260	We're working on sorts, all sorts of crazy stuff.
2659260	2664860	It's going to mean taking some risks, doing things that maybe aren't as algorithm-optimized,
2664860	2669420	but honestly, f*** it, f*** it.
2669420	2670520	We only give them a life.
2670520	2676660	We have the Without A Recipe live finale, we got five incredible main season episodes
2676660	2679800	this year, and tonight, we're doing something we've never done before, our little something
2679800	2686200	extra special, six cameras, live cooking, live voting, live judging, live Keith yelling,
2686200	2687200	perhaps?
2687200	2688200	Perhaps.
2688200	2692640	All in all, despite the video including aesthetic callbacks to their What Happened upload, it
2692640	2696960	doesn't feel like they're trying to necessarily emulate it, more rewrite it, and associate
2696960	2701240	it with the evolution that Zack had previously alluded to in the Hollywood Reporter interview.
2701240	2704520	Although accruing a few million views, the news cycle didn't really pick up from it,
2704520	2708620	and it appears that the storm had mostly passed finally, Ned had remained silent on all social
2708620	2712640	media platforms since his parting statement, which almost seemed like a silent seal of
2712640	2717420	validation for the crew and their plans to take the group forward into greener pastures.
2717420	2728660	What would they find there though?
2728660	2744220	The newer era of the Try Guys may not appear particularly striking on the surface, they
2744220	2747460	haven't exactly changed too much about their YouTube content, it's still built off a
2747460	2751140	similar premise, and outside of that, other than the rather subtle rebranding, there's
2751140	2753660	nothing that will particularly jump out at the average viewer.
2753660	2757100	With that said, they have been experimenting with certain concepts, such as the interactive
2757100	2760220	experience they tried on Kizwii the year before, recently announcing that they would
2760220	2764320	be performing Romeo and Juliet, but with the audience deciding and voting on how certain
2764320	2781660	scenes and plotlines are resolved, however it was also about what was going on beyond
2781660	2784700	the Try Guys, and how their lives were developing as individuals.
2784700	2788020	There was this sense that the Try Guys label was somewhat constraining on its own, and
2788020	2790000	that they should be engaging in their own ventures.
2790000	2793720	Keith turned up to VidCon with his comedy band, Lou Burger, and performed a few tunes
2793720	2797480	of their own, went on a small tour, and even performed a sold out off-Broadway musical,
2797480	2798540	The Wizard of Friendship.
2798540	2802220	Keith arguably has the most consistently successful series on the Try Guys YouTube channel with
2802220	2805260	his Eats Everything uploads, which is what it sounds like.
2805260	2808480	Zack Gia was seemingly busy, but probably the most significant development in his life
2808480	2812260	was the news that he had officially tied the knot with his partner Maggie, which was pretty
2812260	2823220	notable given that many doubted that it would ever happen.
2823220	2827040	Eugene probably had the most eventful year of them all though, securing two voice acting
2827040	2831160	roles in major productions, Nimona and Star Wars Visions, he was also cast in an upcoming
2831160	2834820	live-action romance film, but the details of that aren't too well known, other than
2834820	2835980	it sounds pretty gay.
2835980	2839660	He also announced that he would be writing a two-part young adult fantasy book called
2839660	2842120	The Unders, to be released in 2024.
2842120	2845760	Not too much is known about that either, other than it sounds pretty gay.
2845760	2849000	He's probably the least featured in YouTube videos due to the pursuit of these ventures,
2849000	2852720	but he still clearly considers himself part of the posse, and continues to involve himself
2852720	2853720	where needed.
2853720	2857280	It's clear that over time he much prefers the more performative side of media, and doesn't
2857280	2861360	necessarily want to bear too much of his private life, often leaving Keith and Zack to represent
2861360	2863440	the group in podcasts and media interviews.
2863440	2866680	With this in mind, the dynamic of the Try Guys appears to have changed a little, and
2866680	2869580	whereas in the past, Zack had been portrayed as the baby of the group, now he seemed to
2869580	2871340	have taken up a more vocal position.
2871340	2874700	This side was definitely on show in the podcast episode addressing the situation, but many
2874700	2878220	were still pleasantly surprised to see him this outspoken, it allowed him to convey a
2878220	2881500	degree of confidence in his narratives, which was important when Ned was still a common
2881500	2885620	subject of discourse for many, and yet a highly sensitive one where any verbal blunder could
2885620	2886980	result in a lawsuit.
2886980	2890800	Now, we are finding our company in a much healthier place.
2890800	2895880	I think that it brought us all together, it allowed us to reevaluate what we want to focus
2895880	2906200	our energies on, and to shape the company and our image to be less driven maybe by short
2906200	2912320	term goals, and to really recommit to our audience what we care about.
2912320	2915840	Yeah, in spite of all that pressure, they seem to be handling it well, they don't
2915840	2919160	seem too fussed about the notion of variety anymore, more interested in consolidating
2919160	2921720	their audience and creating a strong relationship with them.
2921720	2924600	They mostly refrain from talking about Ned himself, though it's clear that they do
2924600	2928440	feel betrayed by his actions, and even seem suspicious of subsequent events that occurred
2928440	2940280	such as the SNL sketch.
2940280	2943920	With that said though, they seemed to be content with the outcome, although they had seen success
2943920	2948000	akin to a sort of fever dream in the past, being woken by the scandal had allowed them
2948000	2950800	to reevaluate their priorities and mature as a group.
2950800	2954720	There is this renewed sense of unity rooted in that tough situation, and how they subsequently
2954720	2955720	navigated it.
2955720	2959920	Their concern was maintaining those principles that they felt were built on, and in retrospect
2959920	2966160	they felt they had succeeded in doing that.
2966160	2969460	Maybe the Try Guys would never be as ubiquitous as they once were, but they didn't seem
2969460	2973820	too fazed by that, more focusing on content and strategies that matured as they felt they
2973820	2976980	had, and experiencing a degree of shared stability through it.
2976980	2981580	After all, they'd never expected this success in 2014 when it all began, anything was just
2981580	2982580	a bonus.
2982580	2985820	Audiences who were still around expressed that they found the new Dynamite quite enjoyable,
2985820	2988540	and didn't find themselves missing Ned one bit.
2988540	2992120	Some found themselves reflecting on old clips and wondering if he ever really fit in, though
2992120	2995740	some still expressed sadness that the child had lost Ariel and wished her well.
2995740	2996980	But what about the pair?
2996980	2999100	Were they still even a pair?
2999100	3002200	While since pledging to put family first, there have been mostly radio silence from
3002200	3007080	Ned and his relative social media platforms for the majority of 2023, with some speculating
3007080	3008740	on the status of his marriage with Ariel.
3008740	3012580	Well, just shy of 11 months after he had been dismissed from the Try Guys, Ned appeared
3012580	3016380	on his sister Grace's Instagram story, looking like he had prematurely entered his mid-life
3016380	3021220	crisis, attending Taylor Swift's era's tour with no one other than his wife, Ariel.
3021220	3024220	They appeared to be in good spirits, and left the concert together as well.
3024220	3027820	Although this was not shared by Ariel or Ned, it quickly made its way online, as outlets
3027820	3031540	reported that even after the Try Guys had officially cut ties with Ned, his marriage
3031540	3035340	remained sturdy, and many viewers and fans expressed shock towards Ned and Ariel for
3035340	3036340	making amends.
3036340	3038180	I'll discuss that more in a bit though.
3038180	3041720	Nonetheless, although Ned seems to have refrained from speaking about the situation, and there
3041720	3045100	are still questions hanging over his head regarding it, he seems to have retained what
3045100	3048500	was always most important in his life, his family.
3048500	3053800	In the end, although it was a rather painful process, maybe everyone got what they wanted.
3053800	3054660	Allow me to elaborate.
3057820	3066780	At the start of the video, I spoke about the notion of growth, and how, with many collectives,
3066780	3070400	it's very difficult to keep them together when individual goals are constantly changing
3070400	3071400	and evolving.
3071400	3074500	When you have a team of people like Team 10 where everyone is vying for their own taste
3074500	3078980	of stardom, the creative constraints that can be placed on one can feel extremely suffocating.
3078980	3083500	The Try Guys would never like Team 10 though, for them, the success was always a bonus.
3083500	3086260	There was a strong level of trust between each individual, and members were allowed
3086260	3089060	to go off and pursue ventures on their own terms.
3089060	3092500	Why I left Buzzfeed is really this.
3092500	3097260	The whole time we felt like there was more that we could be doing and giving to you,
3097260	3098260	and now's that time.
3098260	3101020	At the same time, when you create something, there's still the desire to move forward
3101020	3104380	with it, and that was illustrated with their departure from Buzzfeed, that was the freedom
3104380	3106980	that they had yearned for, and they appeared to make the most of it.
3106980	3110300	This sort of trust between the members allowed them to grow the Try Guys as a brand while
3110300	3112220	also exploring their own interests.
3112220	3115820	With that said, there's always the threat that maybe a creative avenue has been exhausted.
3115820	3119340	Even with complete control, your brand is still regulated by the premises that you set
3119340	3120340	it up on.
3120340	3123560	With people associating your names with a certain idea of content, it can be very difficult
3123560	3135060	to escape the shadow that viral content can create.
3135060	3138820	By Covid lockdown era, the Try Guys had been going for 7 years, and although they clearly
3138820	3142260	enjoyed what they were doing, they were trying to break out of the cage that they had often
3142260	3146400	been assigned to by the media, as the happy-go-lucky Buzzfeed chaps who just wanted to do things
3146400	3147400	for a laugh.
3147400	3150780	Any behaviour outside of the pre-conditioned ideas would surely shatter the brand that
3150780	3153180	they had so carefully assembled over the years.
3153180	3156700	Unfortunately, that's what restlessness begets within an individual.
3156700	3159920	Restlessness can be externalised through a variety of expressions, for some it's exploring
3159920	3163940	new creative avenues, for others it's about perfecting their craft in a current one.
3163940	3167020	Restlessness is something that can often beget growth and forward movement in a person's
3167020	3170380	life, the desire to do something more, and nevertheless, it can also be something quite
3170380	3174260	negative, it can yield reckless, thrill-seeking behaviour that may not necessarily be within
3174260	3176440	the bounds of what's expected of them.
3176440	3179680	Restlessness is not something that can only manifest itself within a career, it can evince
3179680	3183380	itself over any part of a person's life that may seem stagnant to them.
3183380	3186820	Every single one of the Try Guys probably experienced that restlessness in some sense,
3186820	3190100	I'm sure they'd all gone through a phase of considering leaving the trip, creating
3190100	3193700	their own path, pursuing what they cared about, they were probably wondering how to address
3193700	3194700	that lull.
3194700	3211260	And then along came Ned, I can't look into Ned's mind and tell everyone exactly why
3211260	3215060	he did what he did, I don't think he's some evil big who wanted to wreck years of
3215060	3216060	hard work.
3216060	3219180	Although many people haven't exactly heaped praise onto his character, most have refrained
3219180	3223260	from representing him as this cruel or malevolent figure, more of portraying him as someone
3223260	3226620	who was not entirely up front with the person he truly was at work.
3226620	3229940	Instead of possibly seeking to address the issues that were challenging him within his
3229940	3233860	personal and work life, he likely chose to address his frustrations by pursuing a life
3233860	3238100	outside of the Try Guys, yet as his family became more aligned with his work he turned
3238100	3242660	away from that as well, finding a workplace affair as the slice of life that he desired.
3242660	3246780	There was no ambiguity given how long it persisted for, he wanted it, and although some people
3246780	3250180	may not have been shocked by it, they did seem to be shocked about how public he ended
3250180	3251180	up being with it.
3251180	3254900	Boldly sacrificing an image he had spent years constructing, and placing the public
3254900	3258820	image of the Try Guys into jeopardy, Ned was someone with a degree of intelligence, and
3258820	3262120	although some wouldn't be wrong to assign arrogance to his behaviour, there was a sense
3262120	3265980	that he just didn't really care about what he created, or the repercussions his actions
3265980	3268060	could have, until they revealed themselves.
3268060	3271900	Ned Fomer is no longer working with the Try Guys.
3271900	3275380	Whereas Zach, Keith, and Eugene may have possessed different ideas for how they wanted the Try
3275380	3279740	Guys to be represented, their unanimity in response to Ned's infidelity, regardless
3279740	3283700	of whether one believes it's proportionate, brought them back onto the same page mentally.
3283700	3286980	There appeared to be no second thoughts to how this should be dealt with, and they seemed
3286980	3290740	to act as swiftly as they conceivably could, in spite of the many legal hurdles that may
3290740	3293860	present themselves in removing a member as established as Ned.
3293860	3297420	Nevertheless, although this may have united them in the sense of how they felt about this
3297420	3300780	issue, there was still the threat of tearing down everything they ever constructed, but
3300780	3303020	in time it seemed like that's what they needed.
3303020	3306380	The Try Guys possessed a desire to move forward, but when you've been established for years
3306380	3309820	with your own company, with everything you require to succeed, it can be hard to see
3309820	3311980	where you can even move forward from that.
3311980	3313940	Sometimes you have to go back first.
3313940	3317920	Ned's actions did that indubitably, it snapped the Try Guys out of the cycle they've been
3317920	3321940	living for so long, and forced them to step outside their frequency brand image to address
3321940	3323760	a man who had broken his.
3323760	3327700	No longer were the Try Guys perceived as the friction-free kings that so many audiences
3327700	3331980	found comfort in, they had their own struggle, but in that struggle they seemed to find their
3331980	3343300	own liberation.
3343300	3347580	The Try Guys had spent their post-buzzfeed time trying to establish more distinct relationships
3347580	3351700	between their individual members and their fans, and the characters they created, but
3351700	3356140	for the first time in a while it felt like the Try Guys had something new together, even
3356140	3358060	if it was with one less member.
3358060	3362340	No longer was that struggle provoking sentiments of separation that might pull them apart,
3362340	3364780	it was that struggle that brought them together.
3364780	3368060	There was a sense that maybe all the Try Guys were looking for more, and that the more they
3368060	3373560	could be looking for could be achieved in that world without Ned.
3373560	3383060	It was the best outcome, but was it the just outcome?
3383060	3397780	I think the SNL sketch got it 50% correct.
3397780	3401900	We talk about a lot of internet drama as creators, a lot of it remains within the confines of
3401900	3405860	YouTube though, and occasionally makes the rounds of peripheral social media-oriented
3405860	3406860	outlets.
3406860	3410300	At a glance it's confusing to look at this situation, one can't help but wonder, out
3410300	3414060	of all the stories that we cover online, that this one was the one that picked up the
3414060	3417700	most traction on mainstream outlets, when there are so many more pressing issues in
3417700	3421700	the world they could be turning their attention to, but nothing happens without a reason,
3421700	3426020	and in reality there were a few conditions that likely made this subject more media friendly.
3426020	3430620	First being that the Try Guys were, as creators go, inherently industry friendly themselves,
3430620	3434620	they were YouTube based but possessed name recognition outside of it, second this wasn't
3434620	3438460	a common occurrence, they were rather white bread, and any white bread character caught
3438460	3441380	up in debauchery is always good clickbait.
3441380	3445340	Third cheating isn't a crime, when a YouTuber finds themselves caught up in something more
3445340	3449340	legally tender, news outlets can find themselves rather hesitant in case they accidentally
3449340	3452140	publicise something that could be construed as libel.
3452140	3455540	Although they probably would be able to argue good faith in court, most of the time they
3455540	3459780	simply don't want to, the Try Guys scandal simply was the perfect combination of news
3459780	3463980	that was surprising enough to grab the attention of media outlets, yet PG enough to report
3463980	3465720	on with some degree of confidence.
3465720	3469480	It was too much for the actual story, and it inevitably caused a lot of undue coverage
3469480	3473720	and harassment of all individuals involved, but the SNL sketch didn't stop there, it
3473720	3477320	implied that the Try Guys contributed to that with their video on the matter.
3477320	3482180	Look at me, this is the face of grief.
3482180	3485800	This angle represented a more sceptical side of the internet that felt that this hadn't
3485800	3489300	been handled with respect to the family at the centre of it, and was merely published
3489300	3493120	as a way for them to rescue their reputation that had been brought into contention by the
3493120	3494120	scandal.
3494120	3497400	This was echoed by the NYT think piece, which didn't necessarily appear hostile to the
3497400	3501260	Try Guys, more presented them as a victim of internet culture, being forced to throw
3501260	3504120	their friend under the bus to save their own skins.
3504120	3507640	After all, Ned former was not our generation's Ted Bundy, was he?
3507640	3514800	In new photos captured Wednesday, Ned walks ahead of Ariel, looking unfazed by the scandal,
3514800	3517800	and in this snap, her expression says it all.
3517800	3521800	It's somewhat strange to see part of the source of mass attention pointing fingers
3521800	3525680	at the Try Guys responding to a situation that the media blew up.
3525680	3528900	The Try Guys didn't want to have to defend themselves in that way, but the theories were
3528900	3533160	manifesting every single day, and their response, although somewhat terse, was the best way
3533160	3535680	they could muster up under considerable pressure.
3535680	3539080	Their language sought to relay a timeline of events, but also exonerate themselves from
3539080	3540080	any knowledge.
3540080	3543420	They wanted to halt the speculation in the clearest way possible, but their personal
3543420	3545680	sentiments still reached the surface.
3545680	3549120	The truth is though, that there was always going to be a personal element to it, and
3549120	3552840	it's very hard to navigate that while also being sensitive to the legality of Ned's
3552840	3553840	removal.
3553840	3556960	In a way, by stating what were perceived as facts, rather than actually delving into their
3556960	3560780	feelings, but still not necessarily being able to completely subdue their emotions,
3560780	3564840	they turn what they viewed as a simple workplace violation into a very loaded discourse.
3564840	3568600	There was a lot they probably would have said behind the scenes, they did not say here.
3568600	3571840	Probably one of the most telling moments was Keith being cut off before he could speak
3571840	3574000	properly about that sentiment of betrayal.
3574000	3580880	What happened, it betrayed our trust, and it was a workplace violation, it would mean
3580880	3586160	to all the people in our office who knew what they knew, they would know that we were in
3586160	3590120	the face of everything, like not being true to who we say we are in our value.
3590120	3593880	I think betrayal is what underlined a lot of the emotional response by the Try Guys.
3593880	3597960	So some critics, Ned's actions wouldn't or shouldn't have resulted in a dismissal, which
3597960	3601100	is why they may not necessarily see why it bothered them so much.
3601100	3604160	On the other hand, if it was such a cut and dry decision, then why do they need these
3604160	3605840	videos to justify themselves?
3605840	3609500	There are loads of questions that one might ask to put into contention the often complicated
3609500	3613820	reasons issued in that time, and these seemingly often austere measures, such as fully erasing
3613820	3618080	Ned's presence from pre-recorded videos, but the reality is that what isn't spoken about
3618080	3619780	is probably what they felt more.
3619780	3624180	For the Try Guys, firing Ned was exactly why it mattered so much, regardless of what motive
3624180	3627940	Ned had behind his actions, outside the fact that he had put up this family man facade
3627940	3631240	to all of them while maintaining an at least months long workplace relationship to the
3631240	3634100	others rather than just being upfront with them and admitting he was struggling with
3634100	3637500	his faithfulness, he must've known what he was putting at stake by doing this, not just
3637500	3641760	the entire brand image but also their friendship which was largely tied up in that business.
3641760	3645000	These are the guys who had built an empire together for 8 years, who had crafted such
3645000	3648260	a deep relationship, not just with their viewers but with each other, and where some would
3648260	3652060	argue that the Try Guys sold Ned down the river and discarded those memories, putting
3652060	3655920	their interests above those of a friend, it was Ned who really put his own personal interests
3655920	3660100	above those of his friends first, doing it so brazenly to the point where even fans took
3660100	3663660	notice, either he thought his friends wouldn't take action against him despite him lying
3663660	3667420	to them and his audience, or he didn't care enough about what repercussions they would
3667420	3671340	have to sanction and the stress it may invoke, both scenarios that show a disregard for that
3671340	3673620	friendship he proclaimed so loudly.
3673620	3676860	Even if you don't believe the Try Guys claims that they would've dismissed Ned regardless
3676860	3680780	of who informed them, the exhaustion and frustration of having someone you think fondly of putting
3680780	3684640	the onus on you to punish them when you would rather be helping them sort their shit out
3684640	3688700	is an incredibly draining experience, Keith, Zach, and Eugene took no pleasure in what
3688700	3692000	they did, and I think that's what people see when watching that video, the sadness
3692000	3696380	of losing a colleague, a friend, and questioning why it had to happen, and sure you could say
3696380	3700540	that it didn't have to happen that way, that all the reactions airbrushing his existence
3700540	3704700	were not necessary, and I get that, but for the Try Guys at least it made sense in that
3704700	3709500	moment, because to them he'd already separated himself through his actions, so they separated
3709500	3710500	him.
3710500	3719000	Even if it made sense that the media were predisposed to cover this subject, it was
3719000	3723280	still surprising for all, even the Try Guys, but their decision was already made, and for
3723280	3727540	the media to present their public explanation of actions they'd already carried out in private
3727540	3732040	as performative felt more like a way to account for their own excitement surrounding a situation
3732040	3736260	which they probably would have all rather handled in private anyway, and yet it became
3736260	3739780	greater than most internet dramas will ever be.
3739780	3747580	For a brief spell, Ned Forman was one of the most maligned people online, and that just
3747580	3752340	didn't make sense to some, and to be honest, I understand it, although I would say that
3752340	3756260	the Try Guys response was pretty proportional to the amount they were probably put through
3756260	3760460	when overseeing this situation and its aftermath, there definitely was something outside of
3760460	3764660	his actions and the media response that made people on social media take more personal
3764660	3766900	umbrage with him than they should have.
3766900	3767900	How come?
3767900	3773200	Ned Forman- If some cheating is happening, it's probably indicative of some deeper problems,
3773200	3776780	so if you say keep it in, I say tell the person.
3776780	3780940	On a cursory look, Ned was the Try Guy with it all, he had a stable and successful career,
3780940	3785140	a well connected network in multiple industries, a degree from a prolific university, he could
3785140	3788340	practically walk into any job and assume whatever role he wished.
3788340	3792200	At his core though, what completed him for many of his viewers, and the Try Guys fanbase
3792200	3793900	as a whole, was that family.
3793900	3797860	Ned chose to make his family part of the online world, to present himself as that devoted
3797860	3802200	husband and family man, he made that part of his brand, however, he also came across
3802200	3806520	as extremely competitive, very driven, and intense to a significant fault.
3806520	3810200	I think there are very few personalities that are more prone to becoming restless, yet as
3810200	3813500	the person with likely the most consistent and stable life of the members of the Try
3813500	3816120	Guys, there did seem to be a contradiction of existence.
3816120	3820380	In spite of this, you never received the impression that this was a problem, even during the times
3820380	3823580	when fans found the cheating was occurring, he continued to talk about these matters like
3823580	3824580	he was on top of them.
3824580	3825580	Ned- Happy date night.
3825580	3829220	Jen- This is gonna be great, I think we did a really good job, and whatever happens.
3829220	3830220	Ned- Whatever happens.
3830220	3831220	Jen- I love you.
3831220	3832220	Ned- We're in it together.
3832220	3833220	I love you too.
3833220	3837980	The fans Ned weaved an intricate web of deceit, he continued to profit off an image that simply
3837980	3842860	was not the case, and all while his wife maintained this on the Try Guys channels as well, there
3842860	3846980	was something so shameless about his actions, and ultimately what they culminated in, that
3846980	3850860	caused a lot of anger amongst people who thought they knew him better, the Try Guys
3850860	3851860	included.
3851860	3856180	I think that perceived privilege combined with his actions likely made his behaviour,
3856180	3859700	although not heinous on a standalone basis, rather insulting to all affected.
3859700	3864300	Further to this, there was a very stark contrast between Ned and the rest of the Try Guys reaction,
3864300	3868180	whereas they wanted to be as thorough as possible with their audience, Ned provided very little
3868180	3871780	information, merely stating that he would be taking time off to focus on his family.
3871780	3875340	It appeared to many to be a somewhat callous statement that didn't necessarily recognise
3875340	3878500	the damage it had done to those involved, even though it was probably the best thing
3878500	3882100	he could commit to doing, for many it felt like he was saving face.
3882100	3885940	From this moment on, it was very easy for people to characterise Ned as that villain
3885940	3889780	with the information they had available, and to reflect on his actions as always actually
3889780	3893900	demonstrating something negative, perceiving him as this malevolent character.
3893900	3897980	Add to which is the mix, and he became a cartoonish caricature of the person he probably was,
3897980	3900580	remembered for this singular incident and treated as such.
3900580	3903980	All limp attempts to defend him through the media were theorised to be a result of his
3903980	3908060	doing, his attempts to get back at the Try Guys, despite the fact that there was no real
3908060	3913420	evidence that he was involved, and that these would be very futile responses anyway.
3913420	3918060	A lot of people have almost used the Try Guys thorough dissociation from Ned Forman to justify
3918060	3921500	that he must have been the worst of the worst, but I just think they were upset at Ned for
3921500	3924900	being placed in that position, rather than thinking that he was actually scum of the
3924900	3925900	earth.
3925900	3929520	The downside of there being business involvement in their separation is that it did lose that
3929520	3933700	human aspect, something that neither parties appear to want to talk about, in one of their
3933740	3938220	2023 interviews, a journalist asks Keith and Zack whether they still have any contact with Ned,
3938220	3942460	and the publicist interrupts to inform them that they cannot speak on that matter, and although it is
3942460	3947220	not my place to hypothesise whether they do or they don't, I wouldn't be offended if they did,
3947220	3951300	but I'm sure other people would be, which is why they'd rather leave it as an unknown quantity.
3951300	3956700	After all, the one Try Guys associate who has publicly remained in his life has received flak for that decision.
3956700	3961620	As noted earlier, when the news broke that she hadn't girl bossed him out of his life, there was a significant
3961620	3966180	cohort of internet marriage counsellors who wanted to put the blame on her, who implied that she was
3966180	3970540	enabling his behaviour by not divorcing him, people who want to tell you that actually co-parenting
3970540	3974900	isn't so bad, and she might as well take the plunge, that she was sending a bad message to the children
3974900	3980020	by not holding him accountable. These arguments range from hilarious to rather insulting to a mother
3980020	3984660	who has probably been put through a fair share of personal turmoil trying to navigate a crisis within marriage.
3984660	3989460	Ariel former knows Ned better than any of us, and if she made the decision to stick with him and pursue
3989460	3993660	happiness together, then I wish her the best with it. Just because you can't empathise with how she
3993660	3998700	approaches it, doesn't mean she is objectively wrong. Accountability can come from a variety of avenues,
3998700	4003100	it doesn't equate to ruining someone's life, and all the people trying to use the Try Guys to shame her
4003100	4006740	for not doing that should maybe reflect on what the Try Guys said themselves.
4006740	4013340	Ned- We also want to remind you that the internet has a tendency to be a lot harsher towards women than men,
4013340	4016940	so please, we ask that you exercise kindness.
4017060	4021340	There is this Dunning-Kruger effect online where people just seem to assume that everything that happens
4021340	4026300	publicly is exactly how it happened privately as well, that there's been no personal discussions about
4026300	4031980	responsibility, no remorse, no understanding or resolution between any party, which is strange given how much
4031980	4037580	confidentiality was emphasised by the Try Guys. Sure, Ned could have made a half hour video about how sorry
4037580	4042660	he was, but would it have alleviated the situation? With all the intersections of public and private figures
4042660	4047700	who were caught up in this web, the intense media interest, and the desire to actually not blow it out of proportion,
4047700	4052900	I'm somewhat doubtful. If anything, the one thing Ned did right was walking away as quietly as possible
4052900	4057380	and seemingly rebuilding that marriage out of the public spotlight, something that I would say family
4057380	4062100	relationships shouldn't be subjected to in the first place. What Ned did was wrong, and there was inevitably
4062100	4067260	upset and anger from those who actually cared about him and the person he presented himself as, those close
4067260	4072060	to him, as well as those who could only watch over a screen. But for those talking about divorce, it already
4072060	4077020	happened in a five minute video a year ago, and it looks like both sides received the settlement they were
4077020	4082380	looking for, and if you have a problem with that, then you have more of a problem than anyone actually involved.
4082380	4084380	So let's wrap this up.
4098260	4104260	I mean, they're like brothers, they drive me nuts sometimes, but I think we make amazing things.
4104260	4107260	That's greater than the sum of its parts.
4107260	4112780	And we've only been able to affect people in a positive way, because we are actually best friends.
4112780	4115260	If we start fucking hating each other, then we should stop.
4115260	4119900	I'd like to start this conclusion by once more pointing him towards the cosmopolitan interview that Ned did
4119900	4124060	where he said he would move to Canada if he was ever cheated on. The other person who provided an answer
4124060	4128860	in that interview was Try Guy Zack, who appeared to take a more nuanced view. If someone cheats on you early
4128860	4133420	in a relationship, that's typically a deal breaker, because it could be a sign of more strife to come,
4133420	4137820	but it's good to hear someone else, what was the circumstance, did they get caught or admit it with remorse,
4137820	4143020	and do you believe it's an isolated incident? If you haven't had the exclusive talk yet, it could be a good way
4143020	4147820	to open a necessary conversation to make sure both of you are on the same page, it's all about communication
4147820	4153660	and making sure you're on the same page. Or I think it is, I'm single, so what do I know?
4153660	4158220	Well, Zack appeared to know more than Ned, and ultimately Ned should be very grateful that his wife
4158220	4162860	appeared to align more with Mr. Kornfeld's point of view, that there was something worth saving,
4162860	4167020	but maybe there was something worth saving for everyone, they all just needed reminding of it.
4167020	4170700	And then I started to see that the Try Guys was becoming something else, that the Try Guys was
4170700	4177260	rigid and incapable of change, and that any attempt that I had to push against that
4179180	4180620	wasn't going to work.
4180620	4184700	When four men in an office decided to put on women's underwear, it would have been difficult to predict
4184700	4188780	what it would lead to, yet over the span of eight years, the Try Guys had built their reputation as
4188780	4192860	one of the most stable and consistent YouTube collectives with a clear and unwavering mission.
4192860	4197660	Whilst other groups came and went with overwhelming transients often pulled apart by individual interests,
4197660	4202620	Keith, Zack, Eugene, and Ned perfected a maturing chemistry that allowed them to grow as the quartet
4202620	4207100	that many people perceived them as, acquiring more independence while maintaining a forward momentum.
4207100	4210700	However, even the strongest partnerships can be subject to their own tribulations,
4210700	4213820	and behind the scenes restlessness appeared to be brewing amongst the members,
4213820	4215980	yet few could have foreseen what it would culminate in.
4216540	4220380	You and your wife seem like you have such a great relationship, and it's kind of like an internet joke
4220380	4225340	how much you talk about your wife, you always bring her up in conversations and things like that,
4225340	4228860	so tell us, like, what's your number one secret to a great relationship?
4231420	4232540	Oh gosh.
4232540	4237020	Ned, the man who was perceived as the Try Guy who put his family and those close to him above all else,
4237020	4241420	designed that a months long workplace affair was the answer to whatever difficulties he was encountering.
4241420	4245340	In that decision, he not only acted counter to what the Try Guys felt they represented,
4245340	4247580	but also what he represented himself as.
4247580	4250700	In a way, although there were many worse things one could do in a workplace,
4250700	4254060	there weren't many that felt more contradictory to what they had crafted.
4254060	4258220	He fell short of what they expected of him, not just as a Try Guy, but as a husband.
4258220	4260540	With that in mind, the Try Guys felt they had to act.
4261100	4265420	There was no easy decision, if they were to operate by the book of how to handle these situations,
4265420	4266780	then they had to let him go.
4266780	4268860	At the same time, he was a close friend to all,
4268860	4272780	and the Try Guys would be irreparably changed in enacting that protocol.
4272780	4275740	In the end, it was a decision they took, but at what cost?
4275740	4281180	After a month and a half, I cracked, and I texted this to Keith and Eugene,
4281180	4287340	it's like, there's so much that we can't talk about, and can't say,
4287340	4292380	and I can't tell, like, you know, people are like, oh, even fucking SNL is like,
4292380	4294140	oh, his bro had a little smooch.
4294140	4300140	And I'm like, that's not what fucking, okay, fine, I'm just gonna keep it clamped down,
4300140	4303420	I'm just gonna not say anything, I'm gonna do it right, I'm just gonna do things right.
4303420	4307340	Well, in the following weeks, they were subject to a list of speculation about their own knowledge,
4307340	4310860	the proportionality of their punishment, and opinions from people who do not,
4310860	4312220	and will never know them.
4312220	4315740	Purposely distancing yourself from a long term friend can be an extremely challenging
4315740	4317340	mental process for one to go through.
4317340	4320780	With all this attention on them for something they would have rather kept under wraps,
4320780	4323580	it must have been easy to question whether they were making the right decision,
4323580	4327820	yet in time, it became apparent to them that maybe this was what they needed to move forward.
4327820	4331820	When a controversy affects a group with weak relationships and weak trust like Team 10,
4331820	4335180	then it can often erode the faith and confidence remaining members may possess,
4335180	4338700	but in the Try Guys case, it strengthened those bonds and those relationships because they all
4338700	4339980	trusted that new route.
4339980	4343740	If there was any sign that their decision was the right one, it's that Ned and Ariel are still
4343740	4348220	together, but also the fact that the remaining Try Guys are still one unit is relevant as well.
4348220	4351420	Judging by certain comments, it's a fact that may not have been the case if they
4351420	4355260	hadn't been given a sharp wake up call from the unquestioned success of the past decade.
4355260	4361180	And I think within that we're also taking it as an opportunity to wake up from this
4361180	4364140	crazy wild ride that's been the Try Guys up to this point,
4364140	4367900	to re-evaluate who we are and who we want to be going forward.
4367900	4370940	The Try Guys may not be renowned for making heavy duty content,
4370940	4375180	they may not be perceived as reaching the same artistic heights of other more ambitious creators,
4375180	4379100	but there is a timelessness about the uploads that has survived numerous shifts in the YouTube
4379100	4384060	ecosystem and retained a loyal fanbase who haven't disappeared as their content lost its virality.
4384060	4387900	For all the provocative content one can find on YouTube, for all the shorts one can scroll
4387900	4391420	through and lose hours to, there's an appeal to watching some dudes just fuck around with
4391420	4394940	something they've never done before. That experience of approaching something unknown
4394940	4399020	for the first time is transcendent, coming out wiser and stronger, knowing better for
4399020	4403500	the next time and appreciating the experience. To the Try Guys, it seemed dealing with the
4403500	4407420	Ned former scandal was just an extension of that, an abrupt if slightly challenging
4407420	4411900	learning experience which cost them a member, but gained them a lot of perspective.
4411900	4415580	What could have been the climax of their existence was just another chapter.
4415580	4419420	A lot of interpretations of Keith, Eugene and Zach's handling of Ned seemed to create
4419420	4423420	a much greater antagonist than the one that was actually present. The emotions that the Try Guys
4423420	4427660	felt were weaponised to fulfil some twisted sense of justice and shard on Friday for the internet
4427660	4432620	masses, however, I don't think they feel bitter about it or wish any further suffering from it.
4432620	4437180	If anything, I think they cherish and value that 4 member era, Ned and many of the memories
4437180	4441180	they created with him, and that saying goodbye to their former colleague, hard as it was,
4441180	4442940	doesn't have to undermine those memories.
4443900	4462060	Ned himself had something else to say, whether he truly appreciated that at the time or not,
4462060	4466620	the former family needed to come first. For ages they'd been part of that Try Guy network
4466620	4471100	and become taken for granted like a brand. His facade becomes so comfortable that he wore it
4471100	4474700	in front of the ones he loved, and with the tearing away of their masquerade, he may have
4474700	4480140	needed to confront some uncomfortable truths. If they can emerge together from that, I'm happy for them.
4480140	4484620	Ned former and the Try Guys made YouTube history together, they reached milestones and created
4484620	4489420	memories that will never be erased, and although their belated honeymoon era came to a very sudden
4489420	4493020	end, their story didn't, and that was a testament to something greater.
4493580	4497740	A statement that maybe the Try Guys weren't quite finished trying yet.
4498780	4511740	And that means that we can fight and get over it. So hopefully we're brothers.
4511740	4524060	Thank you for watching.
4524060	4546140	So that was the video, I hope you enjoyed. I want to give a big thanks to my editors,
4546140	4551020	as always, they've done a great job. My post editor, Kojak, thank you very much for your
4551020	4556220	unwavering commitment to this role. The music done by John Redhunter, thank you again,
4556220	4560940	it's sincerely appreciated, and the thumbnail produced by Starfo, another stellar piece,
4560940	4565740	I am sure. I also want to credit the artists who've, as always, very generously lent their
4565740	4570060	pieces towards being used in this content, it means a lot to me, and their credits will be
4570060	4573980	in the description below, and as said in my previous video, I'm working on a new system where
4573980	4578300	hopefully they'll be able to have the little sprites up as well, so you can all see their
4578300	4582780	distinctive style. I also want to give a big thanks to my Patrons, $10 Patrons on screen right
4582780	4589260	now, and my $50 Patrons, Hypercube, Esther Bedoya, and Seritish, thank you very much.
4589260	4594860	At some point I need to sort out these YouTube member benefits as well, but that's not quite
4594860	4598940	the top of the priority list right now. I'd also like to thank Incogny for sponsoring this video,
4598940	4603580	thank you again, it's been a pleasure to work with you as always, and definitely check their
4603580	4607740	application out, I dig it for sure. I don't know if I have too much else to say,
4607740	4612860	it's getting cold up here, it's getting cold towards the winter, and I don't want to record
4612860	4617420	too much beyond my capacity before I get chilly, so I'll leave you here for now,
4617420	4621340	all I'll say is that I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you in the next one.
