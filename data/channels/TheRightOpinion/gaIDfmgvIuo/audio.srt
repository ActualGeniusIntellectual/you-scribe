00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,480
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,800
too much free time, and today we talk about the ever existent, strange obsession with

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,360
child stars, because if there's one thing that I doubt the internet will ever rid itself

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,160
of, well, it's that. I've spoken about children online in the past, and I'll likely speak

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,360
about them in the future. I'd say in my new style the last time I properly covered this

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,460
sensation was in my Lil Tay video, which once again attributed a strange fixation to the

7
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,080
idea of young kids doing adult things. The point of that video was to document how fascinated

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,340
we become when someone behaves in a way that is not necessarily expected of them. Whenever

9
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,340
you are doing something that has an appeal that no one else is doing, you will typically

10
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:51,000
gain fame for it, and at that point you introduce the factors that will actually determine the

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
longevity. However, with someone like Lil Tay, the whole system is broken, the fact

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,800
that it is driven off being more and more audacious, it is destined to slide into an

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,720
absolute burnout, or you end up not being able to keep up. The outcomes on either side

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,600
are not particularly rosy, and if none of that fails to kill your career, growing up

15
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,100
will. Child fame is not something that really should be glorified. We'll always need children

16
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:18,040
in our media, particularly in areas such as film, to make sure they are provided representation.

17
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,840
At the same time, the unique mental circumstances that a developing child encounters cannot

18
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,340
be discounted, and cannot be exposed to the ravenous hordes of internet dwellers like

19
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,320
many of us YouTubers. There are nuances to this argument, and I'll probably address

20
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,500
them another time, particularly when that person might be able to exert adult levels

21
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,920
of influence, but most of the time, these people are just puppets for fame hungry parents

22
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,640
or siblings, who want to find ways to exploit that childhood reliance to make them conduct

23
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,400
certain actions that arouse online interest, and use the fact that they're not autonomous

24
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,000
to claim any profit and benefits. It's a scummy, but unsurprisingly common dynamic

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,680
that you'll find, and these kids are often the ones who will take the mental fall from

26
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,980
it. However, Lil Tay was, as predicted, a brief fad that was in itself an escalation

27
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:07,800
of the juxtaposition between adult behaviour and childish appearance, one that could inevitably

28
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,040
not be topped, and left a trail of destruction in the culture that had ultimately set herself

29
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,920
up. However, the death of one market always leads to the rise of a new one, and the thing

30
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,680
is that although many trends are short lived, they are almost always born out of some longer

31
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,760
term human interest. These long term human interests provide anchors, and unfortunately

32
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,360
the fascination with children being placed in environments that would seem surreal for

33
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,320
them is a consistent one, and today, more than ever, this has pushed into a serious

34
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,060
boundary. I'm going to leave this narrative on hold, because the new market leads us to

35
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:45,720
a very interesting individual, who goes by the Instagram username of melody officiad3,

36
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,980
or melody officiad3, I guess. Now, Melody is a Brazilian figure online, her real name

37
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:57,320
is Gabriela Severino, and according to the very quaint Wikipedia page, she's a singer

38
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,460
and songwriter, all at the age of 11. Wow, that's a very impressive feat. She has released

39
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,760
a plethora of singles, ones that I'm sure will reach at some point in this video, a

40
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,760
few of these songs have performed fairly well on the Brazilian charts, she's been around

41
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:17,120
since 2015 from the age of 8, so she's already had more of an esteemed career than me. One

42
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,280
day morning sun, one day. However, today as we'll see, she's in the YouTube headlines,

43
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,440
well in this video at least, so the right opinion headlines, for certain conduct that

44
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,540
is much more questionable than just writing songs. You see, I have a friend, I know, surprising,

45
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:37,320
he goes by the name of Marriot, James Marriot, and he made this video on someone he branded

46
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,700
as Daniel Cohen's sister, which you know, I used my genius to decipher, it wasn't actually

47
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,780
Daniel Cohen's sister. But besides the point, it's spicy clickbait, and although I love

48
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,560
a good James Marriot video, I didn't quite have the time, so I passed up on it then.

49
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,000
And anyway, he didn't need my patronage, his video was enticing enough for a couple million

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,120
other people, and he is succeeding off it, and I'm happy for him. But it would be really

51
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,680
great if we could get this video to 3 million, just to piss him off. Now, what caught my

52
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,840
eye was when Marriot contacted a group chat that I was a part of, with the development

53
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,980
detailing this. The information that actually the publication had led to action, and suddenly

54
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,720
whatever video he had made on it seemed to be documenting something much more serious.

55
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,040
Now, in this DM, it said her Instagram was removed, and at the time it was, however,

56
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,000
it has since been returned, with a lot more of the suspect images removed. I mean, if

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,240
I had taken heed of the thumbnail, I should have been alerted fairly promptly, but I didn't,

58
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,640
after all clickbait is exaggerative, and you don't pay close attention to these things.

59
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,260
But really, from the start, this should have been a huge cause for alarm, and yet instead

60
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:44,560
of alarm, she has amassed a total of 3.7 million followers on Instagram, and comments that

61
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,960
are a bit unsavoury. It appears in this specific situation, the real catalyst for this development

62
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:55,740
was the YouTuber Felipe Neto, who has approximately 30 million subscribers, and therefore a tad

63
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,880
bit more clout than Mr Marriot, though there's still time James, there's still time. The

64
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,540
thing is, in my Lil Tay video, I discussed a lot about familial influence. As a sensation

65
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,760
it seems, on one hand, it is impossible to stifle. However, one of the things that had

66
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,740
occurred to me when researching this topic is a very new cultural discussion, and one

67
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,800
that I would love to have today. So, join me as we deconstruct the Instagram of Melody

68
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,940
Oficial, her career, her history, her family, the environment that she has yielded from,

69
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,860
the culture that has created her, and how this has manifested into the situation that

70
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,140
we have witnessed today, one that has allegedly snowballed to the point where authorities

71
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,800
have involved themselves. That is rather important information. This is a lot to unpack, and

72
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,360
I'm not entirely sure how I'm going to do it, but I'm a determined person, and

73
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,400
it shall be done. There's a lot more to this than just a James Marriot video, though

74
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,120
as always, it's a start, the sexy bastard. Let's go.

75
00:05:49,120 --> 00:06:02,400
In 2011, Tayo Cruz released the song Hangover. Generally, it left me with a rather sad taste

76
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,500
in my mouth, it seemed a little too overproduced and dizzying, and although it may have worked

77
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,080
better back then, it didn't perform too great commercially, and signalled the stagnation

78
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,520
of one of music's rising stars. Why am I saying this? Well, it's the first thing

79
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:33,600
I encountered when researching Melanie's father, MC Belligno. MC Belligno, namely Tiago Abreu,

80
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,920
is a Brazilian musician. We use the term musician very liberally in this household, but I have

81
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,580
to give him credit where credit is due, he is creating music. However, to understand

82
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:48,100
his star, you really do fully have to be invested in Brazilian music, and honestly,

83
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,440
we don't really have too much time to completely deconstruct every single cultural element

84
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,740
that creates it, but it is an interesting discussion to have. It is not exactly clear

85
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:03,340
when MC Belligno's music career began, however it's quite evident that he enjoys his music,

86
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,800
and enjoys social media. The first definitive YouTube channel I found of his was called

87
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,820
MC Belligno Funk de Curti, which I was not sure of its translation, so I consulted my

88
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,420
Portuguese language expert who told me that it was just really a name, and probably relating

89
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:23,360
to the Funk genre which we'll discuss soon, but that didn't satisfy me, so I consulted

90
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,880
Google Translate that decided the translation was MC Belly Funk, which I highly doubt is

91
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,440
his actual name, but on the other hand, MC Belly Funk is clearly someone who is a very

92
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,480
typical product of a culture that he is far to invest in, to the point that it's borderline

93
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,080
a meme. In an old biography I found the very interesting information that he is actually

94
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,640
a single father, which is definitely something that we can bring up late, but it's clear

95
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,760
that for a long time he has been chasing a dream, and yet it just didn't take off, probably

96
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,440
because it should be quite clear that he isn't individually the most talented. The first

97
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,240
video was uploaded, which I assume was his own music pasted over pictures of women, which

98
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,280
I assume was the music video, with a female name and the location Pochacatu, which apparently

99
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,840
is a city near Sao Paulo. This is content that frankly, I do not know the meaning exactly,

100
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,080
but judging from its general appearance, it appears that it was being fairly derivative.

101
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,880
What do I mean? Well let's talk about musical culture a lot. When MC Belly Funk decided

102
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,720
to release his first track, the Brazilian charts were pretty Americanised, and it was

103
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,240
hard to distinguish a lot of the singles from the more English speaking markets. This has

104
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,760
been fairly common, particularly with hip-hop, which is what, if anything, I would describe

105
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,560
the musician as. A lot of Brazilian hip-hop, although without a doubt idiosyncratic in

106
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,960
its own rights, still has a lot of culturally defining content that cannot be ignored. However,

107
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,320
as you can probably tell, there is an overarching theme, given the fact that it is rooted in

108
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,920
a lot of struggle. In the US, rap was rooted in that defiant cultural celebration against

109
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,960
an oppressive institutional power who tried to deny what they felt was their identity.

110
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,480
This celebration, however, has also become increasingly immersed in many of these celebrations

111
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,580
that related to more universal content, such as partying, drinking, and what Mon might

112
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:16,160
describe as bitches. Because the content is more universal, and because the content is

113
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,960
more universal, it is thus more marketable, and there are many nuances to this, but know

114
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,960
that this is a universal trend, particularly during the years of the early 2010s, when

115
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,680
watered-down rappers like Pitbull and Flowrider were at their most profitable. It no longer

116
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,860
became about experience, merely being able to rap about pouring it up and creating fantasies

117
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,380
for your audiences to become invested over some Red One-produced beat. There are very

118
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:45,380
few people who are successful in this industry, mainly because it's a set of very complex

119
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,080
algorithms with a user-dictated market, and if people's appetite isn't there, your

120
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,840
career will just be brutally cut. Look at Katy Perry, for example. Music on principle

121
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,520
isn't the hardest to make, but it is incredibly hard to master, and even harder to create

122
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,380
a lasting career out of, and therefore you'll find a lot of artists who are trying to break

123
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:08,060
into the industry by creating a conglomerate of cultural peels falling from whatever they

124
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,880
view as successful, and that's what MC Smellychunk was doing here. The thing is, he's just

125
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,480
like any other amateur artist who has a checklist of hip-hop tropes to talk about. There was

126
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,800
no way that as an individual creator he was going to break through into the industry.

127
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,380
It's incredibly hard unless you're picked up by a label that can provide production

128
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,920
value to launch you, and you actually have that personality, or you have some sincere

129
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,480
bedroom pop vibe that seems all nice and cozy. This is what MC DeliPunk probably ascertained

130
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,140
at some point. He did actually make some higher production content which gained views, but

131
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,300
also some rather negative feedback. It's on a channel named Funkaton, which I assumed

132
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,800
at first might have been some third party, but it was actually on a channel that used

133
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,920
to be called Tom Produsoyns, with the description giving him the full credit. On top of this

134
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,520
I feel that many of the views came after, and it was still subpar content, created out

135
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,340
of some self-obsession he clearly had, and I say this because of the numerous compilations

136
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,480
he has of him topless, and the fact that his Facebook reads like a Tinder bio. I'm beginning

137
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,740
to think his musical career was just because of some masquerade of ultra-masculinity over

138
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,980
the genuine longing for a romantic relationship. I guess those dating apps weren't enough

139
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,640
for him. However, he did have a couple children, these children were called Bella and Gabriella,

140
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,160
a nice little rhyming scheme going on there, and he still had a clear dream that he wanted

141
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,320
to chase. He kinda had that grip on the industry, so at some point he decided to integrate his

142
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:35,720
two daughters. Now the 2010s were a real revival of the child stars that we hadn't seen since

143
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,020
the 1970s, and social media like Facebook and YouTube provided a real platform for this.

144
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,200
It appears that this is where melody was swooped up. We can typically date this around 2015,

145
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,360
I'm not exactly sure where the growth came from, but at some point the corporate shark

146
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,320
smelled the money and came swimming. Although MC Big Chonk seemed limited in his talents,

147
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,480
he clearly had connections, if they could make him look successful while still sounding

148
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,700
shite. Now at first it seems our good MC Papa here was just trying to cash in on the whole

149
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:09,960
child star narrative, you know, the sort of cheap Rebecca Black-esque song which is purposefully

150
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:14,500
amateurish and laughable. However, there were reports on this, and there were also videos

151
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,260
supposedly demonstrating her vocal ability.

152
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:30,820
She really just looks in pain to be honest. These were the clips that are credited for making her a star, and to my knowledge

153
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,940
they were originally posted to Facebook, but I couldn't find them, so I had to find their

154
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,800
YouTube re-uploads, but with this they made a music video and that song was, I guess, a hit.

155
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:46,220
They started cavorting with the stars, and this opened doors for melody and her father. Papa probably saw an opportunity for

156
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:52,360
himself to profit off this sudden success, and although making an eight-year-old superstar seemed rather objectionable,

157
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,800
I guess it wasn't exceptional enough to gather anyone's immediate attention.

158
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:04,240
But when you don't treat a tumour, it grows, and grows, and oh my god, it's downhill from here

159
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,240
my friends.

160
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,660
One of the things I found in research was that there are a lot of popular

161
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:21,780
Brazilian children. A word that is thrown around a lot in the articles that I read was the word funk and funk heroes.

162
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,220
Now, this is not the funk that we would typically associate with the word.

163
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,220
No, this is much more linked to these terms funk kaleoka and funk ostintaso, which are both

164
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:36,160
variations of the sort of rap genre we're looking at, and there are many more variations of funk that we will probably encounter today.

165
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,280
This is something that MC Telebunk was very invested in, as shown by his creative outputs.

166
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:48,040
And this is the thing, child stars are inescapable, especially in the era of the internet, and I accept them to an extent, and that's

167
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,840
why in spite of the extremely young age,

168
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:57,080
I'm sure people just write it off, because by 2015, young child stars making subpar music had been pretty normalized in the mainstream

169
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,400
industry. So how do we get from there?

170
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,220
to here?

171
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,240
Well, you see, as said, there seems to be a budding market for children in Brazilian music. Researching this,

172
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:19,080
I found a network of MCs, particularly surrounding the Sao Paulo area, and this included a variety of artists. MC

173
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:26,440
Brincredo, MC Pikachu, MC Bin Laden, all are claimed to be specializing in the funk music in question. At the turn of

174
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:32,600
2015, these artists were really gathering steam. However, this market was becoming more and more ridiculous.

175
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,040
This isn't just something that has developed into the situation that we are observing today,

176
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,800
this was a situation three and a half years ago. And you know, I said, as musicians go, Melody was fairly young.

177
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,300
Well,

178
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,480
I actually managed to find a younger one who was six years old, who released a song that translates as

179
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:57,040
Slap on the Bum. Apparently, this one was co-signed by business called RP Prodatura, while Melody was under BM

180
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:04,300
Prodatura. It seems there's just this market of record labels swooping up children to make a quick buck. In this kid's song,

181
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,140
we can translate some of the lyrics as,

182
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:14,080
Slap her on the bum, sit down on your pussy. The song was written by his father and his manager, Wellington Silver, and the girls in

183
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,840
this video are alleged to be his 12-year-old cousin and her 19-year-old friend,

184
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:25,140
Classy. And going back to these child stars, one of the biggest peddlers of this media was a YouTube channel under the name of

185
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:32,920
Programma Panico. They seem to enjoy reporting on these artists, and what you'll see is Melody alongside many other prominent artists, all

186
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:41,460
networking fairly closely. These connections seem to be rooted in one central man known as Emerson Martin, shown here, who clearly enjoys the

187
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,460
company of children.

188
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:49,820
Emerson, although it appears not the manager of Melody, seemed to be very involved with creating this specific culture.

189
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:56,780
Even if he wasn't directly involved with everyone, his grasp reached out and promoted many of these people, who then went on to create

190
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,480
music with fairly explicit undertones.

191
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:05,640
Let's pull up a couple examples just to entertain you guys. In the song, Tava Naruwa, by MC

192
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:12,200
Pikachu, the then 15-year-old is in the street smoking a joint when he is approached by a lady who would like a toke.

193
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:19,480
However, MC Pikachu is a crafty man and demands that she in return gives him the pussy. He demands this quite explicitly.

194
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,720
In another song, Rosa Rosa, by MC Brinquedo,

195
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:39,160
one translation reads that he would like you to rub, rub, rub your turkey in her because she likes it. At the time of release, the

196
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,600
lad was

197
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:47,480
13, I could go on and on and on. The number of MCs are endless. MC Gee, MC Pet, MC

198
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,700
Dukoventy, I could go on. Now, with all this considered,

199
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:56,380
it's completely fair to say that this caused a lot of controversy and wasn't just swept under the rug. There was

200
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,280
significant outrage from people, given that these artists weren't just making this sort of music,

201
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:08,600
but many of them were performing in adult clubs, partaking in adult behavior, and this caused a lot of stir. Now, on one hand, you can

202
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:16,460
legislate against adult clubs and such by putting an age limit on, but when it comes to explicit music, being able to legislate against such is

203
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,600
incredibly difficult. In most societies,

204
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:24,600
we rely on common decency to avoid these scenarios, and this just wasn't happening here. A culture that had been

205
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:30,840
cultivated was enabling this, and if legislators didn't step in, it was only going to go downhill.

206
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:37,400
There was a lot of audiences. These people had fan pages. They were making thousands by being extremely, extremely

207
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,040
explicit in the way they expressed themselves.

208
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:45,960
So, the Sao Paulo prosecution service opened an investigation to the way these children were behaving.

209
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,860
So, where does Melody come into this? Well, according to many articles I read,

210
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,740
it was a viral clip of her that launched the controversy. This one, to be exact.

211
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,400
This caused a petition to be set up by many people that called on the services to

212
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,360
investigate the parents, in this instance, the father, for exploiting her and causing her to form in such a way. In response to this,

213
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:14,300
MCJellyJunk made a video where he defended the scenario, calling the people who attacked him bigots, and that they just want to shut down the

214
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:20,560
industry that they've created. He basically tried to turn this into a cultural war where these people were attacking him because it was funk,

215
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,840
rather than because it was child exploitation.

216
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,760
I wanted to find this video in question, but I think it's been removed from the internet. What we do know,

217
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,760
however, is when the real consequences set in, it appears he changed his tune and committed to changing the behavior,

218
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,000
so she wasn't completely taken away from him.

219
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,960
It was hard to exactly ascertain the outcome of the investigation undertaken by the authorities,

220
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,200
but I found one article that reported that Papa had signed an adjustment of contract that would prevent the

221
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,280
sexualization of his daughter. He made a load of comments about how he was going to change, and I even found this video,

222
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:59,520
which apparently was an uploaded musical apology with her clutching onto a toy, symbolic of retaining that childhood.

223
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:15,880
Basically going full T-Martin. The thing is, of course, although the laws change, it's the mentality that provides the challenge.

224
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,640
Whether the audience was adult pedophiles or children who wanted younger idols, and found them in the gritty

225
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,600
indulgence, the story never has an end.

226
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:37,480
One thing that you will find is that audiences very rarely completely go away, even when a principle is legally enforced.

227
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,680
It doesn't mean that those people just disappear. They never disappear.

228
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:46,840
One of the greatest problems about this situation is that it deals with expression, which is an eternally blurred line.

229
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:53,600
If I say to someone that a child shouldn't express himself sexually, I'm not merely saying that a child shouldn't dry hump a sofa,

230
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,920
I'm talking about content that might also be implicative to sexual behavior.

231
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:03,280
The problem is, although morally we might all have a clear idea where we stand, when it comes down to the line,

232
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:09,600
we will be challenged in our minds, and the law is even murkier, and it is swamped in loopholes,

233
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:18,120
and our good mate Bolinio here wasn't going to lose out on the greatest opportunity for monetary success, and fame that he has ever experienced.

234
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,080
I mean, look at him. He is having the time of his life.

235
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:29,480
We leave the previous chapter from a man whose career has prospered from the usage of his child, and yet is now facing down restrictions.

236
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:37,240
However, the demand for her as a public icon was not going to disappear, so he just had to rebrand a little.

237
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,760
One of the artists that constantly came up in reference when observing the evolution was the singer Anita.

238
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:48,240
According to her father, Melody seems to idolize the singer Anita, and wants to be much like her,

239
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,760
even to the point where she performed a lip sync version of the Anita song Bang, which is a decent banger to be fair,

240
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,640
but I shall not be playing it because it's probably copyrighted.

241
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,320
This was her new road, what her father branded as the non-sexual Anita.

242
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:10,800
In spite of this, the video in question still received rather negative ratings, because although it may not be breaching any agreements regarding sexualization,

243
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,360
its choreography can still be rather suggestive.

244
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,200
This is one of the biggest issues, and this is something that will arise again very soon.

245
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:24,400
What he's doing now is he's making Melody imitate singers that may be a bit sexually suggestive, and then labelling it under parody.

246
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,520
And this is his idea of a loophole.

247
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,560
At this point, you should realize that we've reached a conundrum.

248
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:38,160
Sexualization sells, but it's also an absolutely morally bankrupt thing to do, and doing it makes you an absolutely abhorrent human being when it's your child.

249
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:44,520
I mean, it's not a conundrum for us, but it was for Daddy here, and it was a conundrum because he had the authorities looking at him,

250
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:50,920
and he knew if he mobilized enough people against him, then it might be buy-buy money, and buy-buy daughter too.

251
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,040
But I think we all know which one was a priority to him.

252
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,640
So with this in mind, Papa, and probably many other people who could make a quick buck,

253
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,440
definitely took more precautions regarding how she was portrayed in the media.

254
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:09,360
I mean, this one's a rather innocent song about childhood love, this one's a more mature song about relationships.

255
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,240
Still a bit strange in how it's presented, and I find it hilarious how they couldn't even get a person with genuine acne,

256
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:20,320
and they had to add makeup spots like she was Nanny McPhee, but we'll let that one slide.

257
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:28,480
This time, I think what she did was still fairly questionable, but as observed in my previous videos, people become bored of attacking the same person,

258
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,200
and I guess what she did wasn't bad enough to rile up any further legal action against the family,

259
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:41,880
Though a pretty prominent declaration was the fact that she deleted her old videos, and released the statement that she would no longer be doing falsettos and quote parodies,

260
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:48,240
which was the lip-sync content that I described. A load of news outlets jumped on this, so I guess it was important.

261
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:54,160
I think the main reason she pulled the parodies, at least, was because she ended up with a copyright controversy with Rihanna,

262
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,560
where she had the lip-sync version pulled from circulation.

263
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,560
And looking back then, the comments on these videos, the consensus was very clear.

264
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:07,520
People thought she was being taken advantage of by her father. This is not a new thing. People in Brazil knew this.

265
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,560
She still ended up in controversy, such as her parody of the hands to myself, which once again, it was pretty terrible,

266
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:20,880
but it was that loophole of sexualization through parody, and I guess the fact that she wasn't gyrating the club meant that it was alright.

267
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,600
This is one of the dynamics that the internet has created, and this is why the online world is such a threat,

268
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,120
because people don't look at it the same, and on one hand, that's correct.

269
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:35,560
Me making a video for you guys to see is not the same as me performing this to a stadium.

270
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:41,720
But at the same time, the impersonality and the detachment can make people feel disconnected from the content.

271
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:48,280
If she'd done this live in front of hundreds of thousands of adult men, some of which with their hands pretty deep in their underwear,

272
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,320
I'm sure, the authorities probably would have swooped in immediately.

273
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:05,080
The problem is that MC Nelly Monk was probably quite aware of this, and pounced on the opportunity.

274
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:13,160
This is where we introduce Instagram. It appears that Melody and her sister Bella signed up to Instagram barely months after the initial incident with her father,

275
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:18,360
clearly with the intent of branching out the brand. With a lot of initial content being rather innocent,

276
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:23,640
it was just her posting where she was, what she was doing, and all that jazz. Nothing too provocative.

277
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:30,280
However, Instagram is a platform that I've never really dealt with on this channel, and that's really because I've never felt the impetus to.

278
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,440
I don't have an account, you know, why would anyone want to hear about my miserable life?

279
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:42,920
The thing is that a majority of the mega online sites take an extremely accelerated route not dissimilar to that of civilization.

280
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:48,520
We begin by exploring the websites cautiously, pleasure, leisure, just uploading content,

281
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,560
and then when enough people are browsing and enough algorithms exist, people try and work them out.

282
00:24:53,640 --> 00:25:00,200
And if you've got something like a share button or a like button, suddenly people begin to see how they can obtain influence,

283
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:08,040
whether it's posting snide tweets, pretentious video essays, or in Instagram's case, a whole variety of stuff that I just find impossible to follow.

284
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:17,080
What will be inevitable is the creation of some hierarchy around some general appeal that's held within a demographic,

285
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,880
and once an appeal is worked out, people will try to one-up themselves in that industry.

286
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,400
That's what we saw with what eventually escalated to be Lil Tay.

287
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:31,880
You start with something that rides off its ridicule, such as the notion of a kid flexing with copious amounts of money,

288
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,880
and then it spirals, and the subjects become younger and more audacious,

289
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:41,560
and suddenly this person comes out and fulfills those prerequisites for attention.

290
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:48,200
Now, that's just a general rundown, and as said, the Instagram situation is the main cause for the video today.

291
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,800
But to give you a more experienced description of this specific situation,

292
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,240
I've decided to bring in an expert on the Instagram industry,

293
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,520
and, of course, an expert in bullying kids.

294
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,920
My friend, James Moriot. Take it away.

295
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,920
Hey, friends. I'm not James Moriot. I-I know. The resemblance is uncanny.

296
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,160
My name's Pootsie, and I'm a sometimes editor for Tro, I make my own videos on my channel.

297
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,120
Check them out, that'd be epic.

298
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:17,000
See, James was meant to be here, but decided instead to go on a vacation with his YouTube millions.

299
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:22,280
Hmm, I'm hungry. Maybe I should go to Cafe... Bean!

300
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,240
Regardless, I'll be filling in for him.

301
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,000
If you wanted to pursue a career in modeling,

302
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,880
the case used to be that you'd go through a modeling agency and generally look pretty photogenic,

303
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,520
or unfotogenic, depending on what they're going for.

304
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:39,000
With the introduction of Instagram, any swamp creature can just rise from the depths of the platform,

305
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,360
and with a little digital touching up of their photos, they can become a star.

306
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,440
Now, when I say digital touching up, I'm referring to a specific type of photo editing.

307
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,960
This is the type of photo editing that typically draws more attention to,

308
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,480
shall we say, more sensitive parts of the body?

309
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,680
It's thought editing, that's what it is. It's just thought editing.

310
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,360
Instagram clearly has an expectation, but anybody can do this.

311
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,840
And that's all fine and good until you realize who falls under the category of anybody.

312
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,920
Even though the site claims that they won't allow anybody under the age of 13 to sign up,

313
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,160
they won't really go out of their way to enforce it.

314
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:16,360
It's also very easy to just claim someone else runs your account, or even easier, lie about your age.

315
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,640
But one way or another, children and crowds arrived on the platform,

316
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,440
looking up to their idols like Belle Delphine.

317
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,360
You can see how the things they post could easily become sexualized.

318
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,200
Here you have this site that promotes and rewards sexualization of content,

319
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,960
and you have children coming in trying to follow suit and grow on this platform.

320
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,640
That's when you see rise to people like Danielle Kahn and, of course, Melody.

321
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,600
If you go to her Instagram now, you'll notice that a lot of the posts,

322
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,320
or some of the posts, are rather innocent.

323
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,400
That's because she or her management team deleted a lot of the more raunchy photos.

324
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,960
But only very recently is a response to public outcry.

325
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,160
Some of the pedophiles...

326
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,800
Sorry, sorry.

327
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,560
Melody's fans.

328
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,760
Some of Melody's fans.

329
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,560
I don't know how I got the word pedophile mixed up there.

330
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,760
Some of Melody's fans noticed that the content changed up a little bit,

331
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,520
and they're not having any of it.

332
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,720
A lot of comments on these now deleted photos were very creepy.

333
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,960
It was clear the type of people who were enjoying this content.

334
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,400
But after the controversy, now it's kind of hard to find those sort of comments.

335
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,120
Typically, now what you'll find is people condemning her father,

336
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,280
and a surprising amount of people who are her age

337
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,360
and just happen to look like they're in their mid-40s,

338
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,120
leaving comments about how much they love her.

339
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,000
Because that's normal.

340
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,880
Now, there's nothing inherently terrible about these comments,

341
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,880
but if you compare them to the type of comments that I,

342
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,440
or literally anybody else, gets on a daily basis,

343
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,960
you can see something a little bit fishy is going on here.

344
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,640
Now, I don't want to be the one to say it,

345
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,040
but I don't think Pablo's 12.

346
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,280
He's...

347
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,920
He's looking like he could have a mortgage.

348
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,360
He just matured very quickly.

349
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,240
The sexualization of Melody's Instagram got so bad that people she worked with,

350
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,840
like Felipe Nito,

351
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,240
literally deleted all of the videos with her in them,

352
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,280
because he felt disgusted by how sexualized she was.

353
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,320
He even contacted her father and told him this needs to stop,

354
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,600
or I'm going to do this,

355
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,560
and it didn't stop.

356
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,320
And rightfully, he doesn't blame her for this.

357
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,680
He blames Bolinho.

358
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,840
Big Bolinho.

359
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:08,440
While researching this, one comment that I've seen throughout YouTube, Instagram,

360
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,640
some of her really raunchy TikToks that are still up,

361
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,720
are comments from genuine children around her age that are questioning

362
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,000
why they don't look as mature or act as mature as she does.

363
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,680
See, children on these platforms,

364
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:25,000
acting more mature than they are for attention and likes and whatever else,

365
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,760
it perpetuates this cycle of other children coming onto these platforms,

366
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,360
seeing how these children are acting,

367
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,680
and questioning why they don't act that way themselves.

368
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,080
It's encouraging kids to grow up faster than they should.

369
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,440
There are studies directly related to this and how it affects a developing mind,

370
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,840
and the results of which shouldn't be ignored.

371
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,920
Even if you're able to ignore the fact that more adults

372
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,520
are singing along to Melody's hit singles than actual kids her own age,

373
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,880
I wonder why that is.

374
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,200
Uncle Lester, please stop playing MC Melody.

375
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,080
Children acting older than they are is not simply pet-obeyed,

376
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,840
it's honestly an epidemic.

377
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,280
These kids will develop differently,

378
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,320
and I'm sure Melody's going to grow up to have horrible psychological problems,

379
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,600
if she doesn't already.

380
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,680
But on the bright side, at least MC Bolinho is making fat stacks off of her,

381
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:09,080
so maybe one day you can pay for a good therapist or another chain.

382
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,040
One or the other, really.

383
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,200
If you're below the age of 18 and you're watching this,

384
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,360
hold on to your innocence,

385
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,720
hold on to your childhood,

386
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,240
hold on to anything that makes you not this.

387
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,000
Because as much as you might want to grow up now,

388
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,400
childhood is a very important stage of life.

389
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,320
But there is still more to be explored here,

390
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,000
so I'll pass it back to Turo.

391
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,600
James Moore, it f**ks kids.

392
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,480
Thank you, James.

393
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,200
Be sure to check out his channel in the pinned comment.

394
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,200
And as James has really outlined,

395
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,000
the reason the Instagram content became more sexual

396
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,120
was the same reason why Melody was dropping all fours in the club.

397
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,160
It was the market,

398
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,280
and the father noticed that market and responded accordingly.

399
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,400
And like the first time,

400
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,880
he knows Melody is still in the public eye,

401
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,920
and even if he can't use her one way, he'll find another.

402
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,400
In this instance, no one cared until the outcry.

403
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,640
Instagram benefit because it's a ton of traffic,

404
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,240
and unless there's real outrage against the platform, who cares?

405
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,160
MC Wellyjunk gets to release a few more tripe singles about how rich he is,

406
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,760
and everyone's winning.

407
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,480
Or are they?

408
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:18,120
The thing is that exploitation for business purposes is all that the father knows,

409
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,600
and he was just adapting to what he knew,

410
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,800
and the Instagram platform opened up an international doorway,

411
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,040
because your appeal doesn't solely rely on a Portuguese-speaking market.

412
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,160
Which on one hand, it probably opened up a whole new form of income,

413
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,280
many new opportunities,

414
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,520
but at the same time, you're opening yourself up to a new tidal wave of outrage

415
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,560
with people who are not familiar with your established infamy.

416
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:43,320
Still, she has accumulated over 3 million followers, and she's 11.

417
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,680
Just let that sink in.

418
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,200
Instagram hasn't really done anything,

419
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,800
and she may not be prone to online predators on that platform,

420
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,080
but you know there are a lot of seedy individuals viewing the content,

421
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,200
and at the end of the day, to an extent, that is beyond our control.

422
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,360
But at the same time, she's a child,

423
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,520
and the father is morally dubious in acknowledging these consequences,

424
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,000
because I refuse to believe he's not aware,

425
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,840
and I will call him out for that.

426
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,080
One of the many problems is that we have just become so desensitized to a lot of these things,

427
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,680
it means they pass under the radar even when they're right in front of our eyes,

428
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:19,080
mainly because the online detachment doesn't make us realise the real implications,

429
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,800
particularly when it becomes expected of the culture,

430
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,760
and what happens suddenly doesn't become as much of a reach.

431
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,800
Clickbait thumbnails and exaggerated narratives are a norm,

432
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,200
and so we no longer pay close attention to them,

433
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,720
they almost become a punchline rather than an actual concern.

434
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,280
On top of this, the thing about Melody is that it was all rooted in that funk culture.

435
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,720
From when she was 8, she had that audience who knew her,

436
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,480
and knew what they wanted from her,

437
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,640
and all this Instagram incident is, is a shifting of that delivery.

438
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,800
It is the same expectations.

439
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,640
All of this history is important to note, as it should document a trend.

440
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,160
The father was deeply invested in this, whether it's for the money or the fame,

441
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,120
or whether he wants to release more intolerable tracks.

442
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,600
It doesn't matter, looking at the situation today,

443
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,600
I would not be taking any chances, and neither was anyone else by the looks of it.

444
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,120
Under pressure from those around him,

445
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,000
following a couple interviews where the mother voiced her concerns,

446
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,440
the father wrote a letter apologising for the mother's absence from their life,

447
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,360
and stated that he was working with the authorities to hand over custody to her.

448
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,680
What will happen following this is hard to say exactly,

449
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,000
but it might be a step in the right direction.

450
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,560
On top of this, there are so many cultural problems that can be outlined by observing this situation,

451
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,400
many of which yield from the society that Melody has experienced herself.

452
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,920
One of the constant defences that I found when dealing with these situations,

453
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,040
whether it was from that twat Emerson Martins, or the father,

454
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,960
or anyone else defending the actions, is that it's part of the culture,

455
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,680
and these people are just representing that culture,

456
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,760
and the experiences that come along with it.

457
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,560
Those who are trying to shut them down are the oppressors, breaking apart that defiance.

458
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:56,360
They are the underdogs, punching up with their 8-year-old exploitation.

459
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:01,320
This has been an argument ever-present, with a lot of discussion related to hip-hop.

460
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:07,880
Whether it's rap or funk, its whole demeanour is representing experiences that are not pleasant,

461
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,560
and that is part of a culture.

462
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,160
Plenty of rappers do that, and that is fine,

463
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:18,120
but at the same time, it's important to know where to draw the line when it comes to these topics,

464
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,880
and it's important that the cultural argument doesn't become a scapegoat

465
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,360
to conduct fairly heinous actions.

466
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,080
Just because Pusha T has sold some drugs in his time,

467
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:31,000
doesn't mean that 6ix9ine gets a free pass to underage intercourse.

468
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,120
And if funk is representing experiences of children sexualizing and adultifying themselves,

469
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:41,720
whether MC Toy or Melody, or many more on the list that have made this twisted hierarchy,

470
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,640
then they may want to look at themselves and look at the experiences they create.

471
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:50,360
On one hand, the fact that it might be culturally represented does not shift agency,

472
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,480
because this in itself is a relatively recent situation,

473
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,760
and many of the people participating in this clearly had the free will to decipher that it was wrong,

474
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:03,400
and they were exposed to the sober criticism of others, and they ignored it.

475
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,320
The content was not merely representative, it was indulgent,

476
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:12,760
and it was glorifying a concept deeply broken, and marketing it to other vulnerable children.

477
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,800
There's a vast difference in talking about these experiences and shining a light on them,

478
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,560
rather than implicitly encouraging others to go out and do it themselves,

479
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:25,720
and marketing it to other vulnerable children and questionable adults,

480
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,960
and suggesting that this should be the dream.

481
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:33,480
I mean, Emerson Martins called his mansion the dreams factory, whatever that's meant to mean.

482
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,280
That is a dangerous narrative to create.

483
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,160
However, on the other hand, the fact that many people clearly see this as a route out of such

484
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,800
a deprived, hopeless lifestyle may be a message to society to wake up,

485
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,320
and although condemning this specific incident is the right thing to do,

486
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,800
I know that I do not know the exact details of the situation,

487
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,800
and people who are close to the situation have to look at this and ask themselves,

488
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,600
what drives a culture like that to arise?

489
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,240
What drives people to affirm that lifestyle?

490
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,400
Why is there a demand for it, and why has this network been created?

491
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,920
The situation in Brazil can be pretty dire, depending on where you are,

492
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,400
and although absolute poverty has been decreasing,

493
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,880
income inequality is still extremely high,

494
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,840
and it will breed a mentality where that successful lifestyle is glorifying,

495
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,160
particularly when it's enabled by an audience,

496
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,880
or has prominent figures that it will drive to obtain at all costs,

497
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,160
even if that means sacrificing your children's dignity.

498
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,600
I don't want to deny anyone a chance to escape poverty,

499
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,920
but the means have to justify the ends,

500
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,760
and I feel this is the wrong way,

501
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,680
but when showing something is wrong,

502
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,240
it's not just a case of showing people why it's wrong,

503
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,840
but it's also a question of showing people a better path forward.

504
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,240
I can't specify what path that might be,

505
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,600
because that is a dive into politics so deep,

506
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:57,800
that it would probably require more than just a twat Saturday microphone to uncover.

507
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,280
On top of this, it should be time for sites like Instagram to see some initiative.

508
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,040
According to the terms and conditions,

509
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,080
the sign-up age is 13, and Melody is not 13,

510
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,360
and although her dad's probably the owner of the account to loophole this,

511
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,920
and we shouldn't just ban pictures of children from existing,

512
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:17,000
there is clear contextual detail that should make this situation rather simple,

513
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,760
and once again, without real action, there will be no real lessons learned.

514
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,400
The father constantly sought the success of his peers

515
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,240
by emulating the lowest tropes of that genre,

516
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,480
and as we live in a more interconnected world,

517
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,520
that aim doesn't change just the techniques,

518
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,560
and that's the point.

519
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,920
Melody's more suggestive content was a general appeal

520
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,680
to very seedy figures dressed up in a notion of cultural defiance,

521
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,040
and every genre like that walks the line all over the world,

522
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:48,440
and the genres that influence the Brazilian ones that we witness today did the same,

523
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,000
but people should call it out the same.

524
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,240
You cannot remove that agency,

525
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,680
because from the get-go, it's clear that MC Belligno,

526
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,200
aka Tiago Abreu, had no discernible talent,

527
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,040
and although the daughters weren't anything special either, I would say,

528
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,320
they had something that he could compromise on to make them famous,

529
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,600
and that was their youth,

530
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,960
and that's where many other people with dignity would draw the line,

531
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,720
and it's clear that over the last few years,

532
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:17,000
in spite of the constant controversies facing down the daughters,

533
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,760
he has been unfazed and only sought to maintain that image,

534
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,880
while trying to sidestep authorities at every moment

535
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,720
by tweaking a few of the details,

536
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,360
whether it was parodies, whether it was Instagram,

537
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,960
whether it was anything else,

538
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,400
and many Brazilians have been aware of this for ages,

539
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,320
and although this is only news to us now,

540
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,600
with the change in custody,

541
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,400
I hope it will also be a turning point for her life,

542
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,120
and it's important for people to carry on keeping an eye on her,

543
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,960
and now there's a more global perspective,

544
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,960
on top of the presence from Felipe Neto,

545
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,120
which has also provided positive influence,

546
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,520
not just with the family from the psychological support,

547
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,520
but on social media such as having her content removed from rather seedy sites,

548
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,640
and this has given me a hope that there might be a light at the end of the tunnel

549
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,120
for Gabriela Severino Abreu.

550
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,720
Before we end, I want to say that this video was sponsored by ExpressVPN.

551
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,840
Now, honestly, I've never really been interested in VPNs,

552
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,360
but now I'm a personality with loads of people hitting me up and looking for me,

553
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,360
and also a lot to research.

554
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,000
It's kinda a necessity that I do have something like this,

555
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
that can shield me from hackers and snoopers,

556
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,520
but also give me access to sites that I might not have access to otherwise.

557
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,360
So in a way, I'm glad ExpressVPN hit me up and offered me a good old sponsorship,

558
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,600
because I am a cheap bastard.

559
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,280
Being the critical man that I am,

560
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,080
and obviously given the narratives I've spoken about in the past,

561
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,680
especially regarding better help,

562
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,480
I wanted to use their services first, and they let me.

563
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,840
I've been pretty happy, and it does make me feel more secure.

564
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,160
It helps me traverse problems such as the restriction

565
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,480
that the EU places on certain news sites,

566
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,880
I'm someone who will regularly need to consume media

567
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,200
from obscure American media outlets,

568
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,920
and ExpressVPN can enable me to do that.

569
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,280
If I want to watch my sad old man political shows in the UK,

570
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,560
but the BBC won't recognise my citizenship due to my location,

571
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,360
then I can do that, with Article 13 coming in.

572
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,520
I mean, I don't know how much I'm gonna need it,

573
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,960
but I'm grateful that it's there.

574
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,760
I really enjoy the service, its interface is simple,

575
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,480
I haven't experienced any real lag while using it,

576
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,600
it's to the point, nice little cheeky design,

577
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,360
quick to connect, has locations in around 90 countries,

578
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,200
not that you'd need that many, but it's there,

579
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,280
and they keep your content completely private,

580
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,280
with no real restrictions on what you can do,

581
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,040
and my experience isn't the only one,

582
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,960
they are pretty revered all round.

583
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,960
I haven't had any problems, but if you do,

584
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,280
they have customer support, which is pretty neat.

585
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,040
I did test it out, I sent a message at 1.39am my time,

586
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,880
and they responded in the space of a minute,

587
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,840
so they're clearly receptive, and I think it was a human.

588
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,320
These robots are getting smarter though, mind you.

589
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,480
Even on simple things like filling in a form,

590
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,720
I've found sometimes they can grab my IP,

591
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,480
and although it may not seem malicious,

592
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,480
it's nice to have that extra veil of privacy,

593
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,480
and that's something that anyone can encounter,

594
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,360
so really, I can see it having a purpose for everyone,

595
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,320
to an extent.

596
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,840
As an app, it's pretty much usable on every device,

597
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:05,080
Windows, iOS, Android, Macs, Linux,

598
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,440
router, and more,

599
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,120
I mean, I don't really know how many more there are,

600
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,800
but you know, there probably is more.

601
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,120
There are also browser extensions,

602
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,360
you can get Chrome and Firefox,

603
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,640
not Safari though,

604
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,000
because people who use Safari like pineapple on pizza,

605
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,960
and I made sure we didn't let them in on this,

606
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,880
but even if you do have Safari,

607
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,120
you'll obviously be able to get it on Mac regardless,

608
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,840
it's just the browser extensions they don't have on Safari.

609
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,760
Overall, I haven't had any problems,

610
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,280
and if you are looking for a VPN,

611
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,800
I would recommend it.

612
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,120
Normally, prices are $7 a month,

613
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,160
but if you're not happy,

614
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,320
there is a 30-day money-back guarantee,

615
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,520
and if you use my very spicy code by going on the URL,

616
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,320
expressvpn.com slash tro,

617
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,920
that's slash t-r-o,

618
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,960
as in my initials,

619
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,000
you can get the first three months off a one-year package,

620
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,920
and the links will be in the description

621
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,640
to make it nice and accessible for all you delightful people.

622
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,920
That's all I've got to say about that.

623
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,480
Once again,

624
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,840
good on the lads at ExpressVPN for helping me in my time of need.

625
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,280
Definitely recommend.

626
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,320
If you're looking for something like that,

627
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,640
if you feel like it's going to be something that might benefit you,

628
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,800
then yeah, I'd recommend ExpressVPN.

629
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,320
Anyhow, if you made it to the end of the video,

630
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,440
big thanks,

631
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,560
mega shout out to James,

632
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,720
thank you for appearing,

633
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,920
I'm gonna leave his link in the pinned comment,

634
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,600
and I want you to go and send him some love.

635
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,240
I also want you guys to go and send the editors some love,

636
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:27,080
they have done a fantastic, stellar job as always,

637
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,480
and it wouldn't be the same without them.

638
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,360
On top of this, I want to thank my Patreons,

639
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,280
special thanks to Connor,

640
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,680
I also want to shout out some hullabaloo,

641
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,600
and a special thanks to Ryan,

642
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,360

my $50 and $100 Patreons consecutively,

644
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,800
both fantastic,

645
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,160
I'm very honoured, very flattered indeed,

646
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,600
and you can't really top that sort of dedication,

647
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,520
so respect it a lot.

648
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,280
Anyhow, I don't have too much else to say,

649
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,800
so I'll just see you around guys,

650
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,880
have a fantastic day,

651
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,080
I'm The Right Opinion,

652
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,000
and I'll see you in the next one.

653
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,360
I'll see you in the next one.
