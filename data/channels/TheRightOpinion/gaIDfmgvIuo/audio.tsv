0	9480	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
9480	13800	too much free time, and today we talk about the ever existent, strange obsession with
13800	18360	child stars, because if there's one thing that I doubt the internet will ever rid itself
18360	23160	of, well, it's that. I've spoken about children online in the past, and I'll likely speak
23160	27360	about them in the future. I'd say in my new style the last time I properly covered this
27360	32460	sensation was in my Lil Tay video, which once again attributed a strange fixation to the
32460	38080	idea of young kids doing adult things. The point of that video was to document how fascinated
38080	42340	we become when someone behaves in a way that is not necessarily expected of them. Whenever
42340	46340	you are doing something that has an appeal that no one else is doing, you will typically
46340	51000	gain fame for it, and at that point you introduce the factors that will actually determine the
51000	55000	longevity. However, with someone like Lil Tay, the whole system is broken, the fact
55000	59800	that it is driven off being more and more audacious, it is destined to slide into an
59800	64720	absolute burnout, or you end up not being able to keep up. The outcomes on either side
64720	68600	are not particularly rosy, and if none of that fails to kill your career, growing up
68600	73100	will. Child fame is not something that really should be glorified. We'll always need children
73100	78040	in our media, particularly in areas such as film, to make sure they are provided representation.
78040	82840	At the same time, the unique mental circumstances that a developing child encounters cannot
82840	87340	be discounted, and cannot be exposed to the ravenous hordes of internet dwellers like
87340	91320	many of us YouTubers. There are nuances to this argument, and I'll probably address
91320	95500	them another time, particularly when that person might be able to exert adult levels
95500	99920	of influence, but most of the time, these people are just puppets for fame hungry parents
99920	104640	or siblings, who want to find ways to exploit that childhood reliance to make them conduct
104640	109400	certain actions that arouse online interest, and use the fact that they're not autonomous
109400	114000	to claim any profit and benefits. It's a scummy, but unsurprisingly common dynamic
114000	117680	that you'll find, and these kids are often the ones who will take the mental fall from
117680	122980	it. However, Lil Tay was, as predicted, a brief fad that was in itself an escalation
122980	127800	of the juxtaposition between adult behaviour and childish appearance, one that could inevitably
127800	132040	not be topped, and left a trail of destruction in the culture that had ultimately set herself
132040	136920	up. However, the death of one market always leads to the rise of a new one, and the thing
136920	141680	is that although many trends are short lived, they are almost always born out of some longer
141680	146760	term human interest. These long term human interests provide anchors, and unfortunately
146760	150360	the fascination with children being placed in environments that would seem surreal for
150360	155320	them is a consistent one, and today, more than ever, this has pushed into a serious
155320	159060	boundary. I'm going to leave this narrative on hold, because the new market leads us to
159060	165720	a very interesting individual, who goes by the Instagram username of melody officiad3,
165720	171980	or melody officiad3, I guess. Now, Melody is a Brazilian figure online, her real name
171980	177320	is Gabriela Severino, and according to the very quaint Wikipedia page, she's a singer
177320	182460	and songwriter, all at the age of 11. Wow, that's a very impressive feat. She has released
182460	186760	a plethora of singles, ones that I'm sure will reach at some point in this video, a
186760	190760	few of these songs have performed fairly well on the Brazilian charts, she's been around
190760	197120	since 2015 from the age of 8, so she's already had more of an esteemed career than me. One
197120	202280	day morning sun, one day. However, today as we'll see, she's in the YouTube headlines,
202280	206440	well in this video at least, so the right opinion headlines, for certain conduct that
206440	212540	is much more questionable than just writing songs. You see, I have a friend, I know, surprising,
212540	217320	he goes by the name of Marriot, James Marriot, and he made this video on someone he branded
217320	222700	as Daniel Cohen's sister, which you know, I used my genius to decipher, it wasn't actually
222700	226780	Daniel Cohen's sister. But besides the point, it's spicy clickbait, and although I love
226780	231560	a good James Marriot video, I didn't quite have the time, so I passed up on it then.
231560	236000	And anyway, he didn't need my patronage, his video was enticing enough for a couple million
236000	240120	other people, and he is succeeding off it, and I'm happy for him. But it would be really
240120	243680	great if we could get this video to 3 million, just to piss him off. Now, what caught my
243680	247840	eye was when Marriot contacted a group chat that I was a part of, with the development
247840	252980	detailing this. The information that actually the publication had led to action, and suddenly
252980	257720	whatever video he had made on it seemed to be documenting something much more serious.
257720	262040	Now, in this DM, it said her Instagram was removed, and at the time it was, however,
262040	267000	it has since been returned, with a lot more of the suspect images removed. I mean, if
267000	271240	I had taken heed of the thumbnail, I should have been alerted fairly promptly, but I didn't,
271240	275640	after all clickbait is exaggerative, and you don't pay close attention to these things.
275640	279260	But really, from the start, this should have been a huge cause for alarm, and yet instead
279260	284560	of alarm, she has amassed a total of 3.7 million followers on Instagram, and comments that
284560	289960	are a bit unsavoury. It appears in this specific situation, the real catalyst for this development
289960	295740	was the YouTuber Felipe Neto, who has approximately 30 million subscribers, and therefore a tad
295740	299880	bit more clout than Mr Marriot, though there's still time James, there's still time. The
299880	305540	thing is, in my Lil Tay video, I discussed a lot about familial influence. As a sensation
305540	309760	it seems, on one hand, it is impossible to stifle. However, one of the things that had
309760	313740	occurred to me when researching this topic is a very new cultural discussion, and one
313740	319800	that I would love to have today. So, join me as we deconstruct the Instagram of Melody
319800	324940	Oficial, her career, her history, her family, the environment that she has yielded from,
324940	328860	the culture that has created her, and how this has manifested into the situation that
328860	333140	we have witnessed today, one that has allegedly snowballed to the point where authorities
333140	337800	have involved themselves. That is rather important information. This is a lot to unpack, and
337800	341360	I'm not entirely sure how I'm going to do it, but I'm a determined person, and
341360	345400	it shall be done. There's a lot more to this than just a James Marriot video, though
345400	349120	as always, it's a start, the sexy bastard. Let's go.
349120	362400	In 2011, Tayo Cruz released the song Hangover. Generally, it left me with a rather sad taste
362400	366500	in my mouth, it seemed a little too overproduced and dizzying, and although it may have worked
366500	371080	better back then, it didn't perform too great commercially, and signalled the stagnation
371080	375520	of one of music's rising stars. Why am I saying this? Well, it's the first thing
375520	393600	I encountered when researching Melanie's father, MC Belligno. MC Belligno, namely Tiago Abreu,
393600	398920	is a Brazilian musician. We use the term musician very liberally in this household, but I have
398920	403580	to give him credit where credit is due, he is creating music. However, to understand
403580	408100	his star, you really do fully have to be invested in Brazilian music, and honestly,
408100	412440	we don't really have too much time to completely deconstruct every single cultural element
412440	416740	that creates it, but it is an interesting discussion to have. It is not exactly clear
416740	423340	when MC Belligno's music career began, however it's quite evident that he enjoys his music,
423340	427800	and enjoys social media. The first definitive YouTube channel I found of his was called
427800	433820	MC Belligno Funk de Curti, which I was not sure of its translation, so I consulted my
433820	438420	Portuguese language expert who told me that it was just really a name, and probably relating
438420	443360	to the Funk genre which we'll discuss soon, but that didn't satisfy me, so I consulted
443360	448880	Google Translate that decided the translation was MC Belly Funk, which I highly doubt is
448880	454440	his actual name, but on the other hand, MC Belly Funk is clearly someone who is a very
454440	459480	typical product of a culture that he is far to invest in, to the point that it's borderline
459480	464080	a meme. In an old biography I found the very interesting information that he is actually
464080	467640	a single father, which is definitely something that we can bring up late, but it's clear
467640	472760	that for a long time he has been chasing a dream, and yet it just didn't take off, probably
472760	477440	because it should be quite clear that he isn't individually the most talented. The first
477440	482240	video was uploaded, which I assume was his own music pasted over pictures of women, which
482240	488280	I assume was the music video, with a female name and the location Pochacatu, which apparently
488280	493840	is a city near Sao Paulo. This is content that frankly, I do not know the meaning exactly,
493840	498080	but judging from its general appearance, it appears that it was being fairly derivative.
498080	502880	What do I mean? Well let's talk about musical culture a lot. When MC Belly Funk decided
502880	506720	to release his first track, the Brazilian charts were pretty Americanised, and it was
506720	511240	hard to distinguish a lot of the singles from the more English speaking markets. This has
511240	515760	been fairly common, particularly with hip-hop, which is what, if anything, I would describe
515760	520560	the musician as. A lot of Brazilian hip-hop, although without a doubt idiosyncratic in
520560	525960	its own rights, still has a lot of culturally defining content that cannot be ignored. However,
525960	530320	as you can probably tell, there is an overarching theme, given the fact that it is rooted in
530320	535920	a lot of struggle. In the US, rap was rooted in that defiant cultural celebration against
535920	540960	an oppressive institutional power who tried to deny what they felt was their identity.
540960	545480	This celebration, however, has also become increasingly immersed in many of these celebrations
545480	550580	that related to more universal content, such as partying, drinking, and what Mon might
550580	556160	describe as bitches. Because the content is more universal, and because the content is
556160	560960	more universal, it is thus more marketable, and there are many nuances to this, but know
560960	565960	that this is a universal trend, particularly during the years of the early 2010s, when
565960	570680	watered-down rappers like Pitbull and Flowrider were at their most profitable. It no longer
570680	575860	became about experience, merely being able to rap about pouring it up and creating fantasies
575860	580380	for your audiences to become invested over some Red One-produced beat. There are very
580380	585380	few people who are successful in this industry, mainly because it's a set of very complex
585380	590080	algorithms with a user-dictated market, and if people's appetite isn't there, your
590080	594840	career will just be brutally cut. Look at Katy Perry, for example. Music on principle
594840	599520	isn't the hardest to make, but it is incredibly hard to master, and even harder to create
599520	603380	a lasting career out of, and therefore you'll find a lot of artists who are trying to break
603380	608060	into the industry by creating a conglomerate of cultural peels falling from whatever they
608060	612880	view as successful, and that's what MC Smellychunk was doing here. The thing is, he's just
612880	617480	like any other amateur artist who has a checklist of hip-hop tropes to talk about. There was
617480	621800	no way that as an individual creator he was going to break through into the industry.
621800	625380	It's incredibly hard unless you're picked up by a label that can provide production
625380	629920	value to launch you, and you actually have that personality, or you have some sincere
629920	635480	bedroom pop vibe that seems all nice and cozy. This is what MC DeliPunk probably ascertained
635480	640140	at some point. He did actually make some higher production content which gained views, but
640140	644300	also some rather negative feedback. It's on a channel named Funkaton, which I assumed
644300	647800	at first might have been some third party, but it was actually on a channel that used
647800	652920	to be called Tom Produsoyns, with the description giving him the full credit. On top of this
652920	657520	I feel that many of the views came after, and it was still subpar content, created out
657520	662340	of some self-obsession he clearly had, and I say this because of the numerous compilations
662340	666480	he has of him topless, and the fact that his Facebook reads like a Tinder bio. I'm beginning
666480	670740	to think his musical career was just because of some masquerade of ultra-masculinity over
670740	674980	the genuine longing for a romantic relationship. I guess those dating apps weren't enough
674980	679640	for him. However, he did have a couple children, these children were called Bella and Gabriella,
679640	684160	a nice little rhyming scheme going on there, and he still had a clear dream that he wanted
684160	689320	to chase. He kinda had that grip on the industry, so at some point he decided to integrate his
689320	695720	two daughters. Now the 2010s were a real revival of the child stars that we hadn't seen since
695720	701020	the 1970s, and social media like Facebook and YouTube provided a real platform for this.
701040	706200	It appears that this is where melody was swooped up. We can typically date this around 2015,
706200	710360	I'm not exactly sure where the growth came from, but at some point the corporate shark
710360	715320	smelled the money and came swimming. Although MC Big Chonk seemed limited in his talents,
715320	719480	he clearly had connections, if they could make him look successful while still sounding
719480	724700	shite. Now at first it seems our good MC Papa here was just trying to cash in on the whole
724700	729960	child star narrative, you know, the sort of cheap Rebecca Black-esque song which is purposefully
729980	734500	amateurish and laughable. However, there were reports on this, and there were also videos
734500	737260	supposedly demonstrating her vocal ability.
744260	750820	She really just looks in pain to be honest. These were the clips that are credited for making her a star, and to my knowledge
750820	754940	they were originally posted to Facebook, but I couldn't find them, so I had to find their
754940	759800	YouTube re-uploads, but with this they made a music video and that song was, I guess, a hit.
759800	766220	They started cavorting with the stars, and this opened doors for melody and her father. Papa probably saw an opportunity for
766520	772360	himself to profit off this sudden success, and although making an eight-year-old superstar seemed rather objectionable,
772360	776800	I guess it wasn't exceptional enough to gather anyone's immediate attention.
776840	784240	But when you don't treat a tumour, it grows, and grows, and oh my god, it's downhill from here
784240	786240	my friends.
791500	794660	One of the things I found in research was that there are a lot of popular
795180	801780	Brazilian children. A word that is thrown around a lot in the articles that I read was the word funk and funk heroes.
801820	805220	Now, this is not the funk that we would typically associate with the word.
805220	810220	No, this is much more linked to these terms funk kaleoka and funk ostintaso, which are both
810600	816160	variations of the sort of rap genre we're looking at, and there are many more variations of funk that we will probably encounter today.
816160	821280	This is something that MC Telebunk was very invested in, as shown by his creative outputs.
821280	828040	And this is the thing, child stars are inescapable, especially in the era of the internet, and I accept them to an extent, and that's
828040	829840	why in spite of the extremely young age,
829840	837080	I'm sure people just write it off, because by 2015, young child stars making subpar music had been pretty normalized in the mainstream
837400	839400	industry. So how do we get from there?
840220	842220	to here?
846560	852240	Well, you see, as said, there seems to be a budding market for children in Brazilian music. Researching this,
852240	859080	I found a network of MCs, particularly surrounding the Sao Paulo area, and this included a variety of artists. MC
859080	866440	Brincredo, MC Pikachu, MC Bin Laden, all are claimed to be specializing in the funk music in question. At the turn of
866780	872600	2015, these artists were really gathering steam. However, this market was becoming more and more ridiculous.
872600	877040	This isn't just something that has developed into the situation that we are observing today,
877040	883800	this was a situation three and a half years ago. And you know, I said, as musicians go, Melody was fairly young.
883800	884300	Well,
884300	889480	I actually managed to find a younger one who was six years old, who released a song that translates as
889600	897040	Slap on the Bum. Apparently, this one was co-signed by business called RP Prodatura, while Melody was under BM
897340	904300	Prodatura. It seems there's just this market of record labels swooping up children to make a quick buck. In this kid's song,
904300	906140	we can translate some of the lyrics as,
906140	914080	Slap her on the bum, sit down on your pussy. The song was written by his father and his manager, Wellington Silver, and the girls in
914080	918840	this video are alleged to be his 12-year-old cousin and her 19-year-old friend,
919240	925140	Classy. And going back to these child stars, one of the biggest peddlers of this media was a YouTube channel under the name of
925140	932920	Programma Panico. They seem to enjoy reporting on these artists, and what you'll see is Melody alongside many other prominent artists, all
933520	941460	networking fairly closely. These connections seem to be rooted in one central man known as Emerson Martin, shown here, who clearly enjoys the
941460	943460	company of children.
943860	949820	Emerson, although it appears not the manager of Melody, seemed to be very involved with creating this specific culture.
949820	956780	Even if he wasn't directly involved with everyone, his grasp reached out and promoted many of these people, who then went on to create
956980	959480	music with fairly explicit undertones.
959580	965640	Let's pull up a couple examples just to entertain you guys. In the song, Tava Naruwa, by MC
965780	972200	Pikachu, the then 15-year-old is in the street smoking a joint when he is approached by a lady who would like a toke.
972200	979480	However, MC Pikachu is a crafty man and demands that she in return gives him the pussy. He demands this quite explicitly.
987480	990720	In another song, Rosa Rosa, by MC Brinquedo,
991000	999160	one translation reads that he would like you to rub, rub, rub your turkey in her because she likes it. At the time of release, the
999160	1000600	lad was
1000600	1007480	13, I could go on and on and on. The number of MCs are endless. MC Gee, MC Pet, MC
1007480	1010700	Dukoventy, I could go on. Now, with all this considered,
1010700	1016380	it's completely fair to say that this caused a lot of controversy and wasn't just swept under the rug. There was
1016680	1021280	significant outrage from people, given that these artists weren't just making this sort of music,
1021280	1028600	but many of them were performing in adult clubs, partaking in adult behavior, and this caused a lot of stir. Now, on one hand, you can
1028880	1036460	legislate against adult clubs and such by putting an age limit on, but when it comes to explicit music, being able to legislate against such is
1036560	1038600	incredibly difficult. In most societies,
1038600	1044600	we rely on common decency to avoid these scenarios, and this just wasn't happening here. A culture that had been
1044960	1050840	cultivated was enabling this, and if legislators didn't step in, it was only going to go downhill.
1050840	1057400	There was a lot of audiences. These people had fan pages. They were making thousands by being extremely, extremely
1058200	1060040	explicit in the way they expressed themselves.
1060040	1065960	So, the Sao Paulo prosecution service opened an investigation to the way these children were behaving.
1065960	1069860	So, where does Melody come into this? Well, according to many articles I read,
1069860	1073740	it was a viral clip of her that launched the controversy. This one, to be exact.
1077280	1081400	This caused a petition to be set up by many people that called on the services to
1081440	1087360	investigate the parents, in this instance, the father, for exploiting her and causing her to form in such a way. In response to this,
1087400	1094300	MCJellyJunk made a video where he defended the scenario, calling the people who attacked him bigots, and that they just want to shut down the
1094320	1100560	industry that they've created. He basically tried to turn this into a cultural war where these people were attacking him because it was funk,
1100560	1102840	rather than because it was child exploitation.
1102840	1107760	I wanted to find this video in question, but I think it's been removed from the internet. What we do know,
1107760	1113760	however, is when the real consequences set in, it appears he changed his tune and committed to changing the behavior,
1113760	1116000	so she wasn't completely taken away from him.
1116000	1120960	It was hard to exactly ascertain the outcome of the investigation undertaken by the authorities,
1120960	1126200	but I found one article that reported that Papa had signed an adjustment of contract that would prevent the
1126640	1132280	sexualization of his daughter. He made a load of comments about how he was going to change, and I even found this video,
1132280	1139520	which apparently was an uploaded musical apology with her clutching onto a toy, symbolic of retaining that childhood.
1143760	1155880	Basically going full T-Martin. The thing is, of course, although the laws change, it's the mentality that provides the challenge.
1155880	1161640	Whether the audience was adult pedophiles or children who wanted younger idols, and found them in the gritty
1162120	1164600	indulgence, the story never has an end.
1164600	1177480	One thing that you will find is that audiences very rarely completely go away, even when a principle is legally enforced.
1177480	1180680	It doesn't mean that those people just disappear. They never disappear.
1180680	1186840	One of the greatest problems about this situation is that it deals with expression, which is an eternally blurred line.
1186840	1193600	If I say to someone that a child shouldn't express himself sexually, I'm not merely saying that a child shouldn't dry hump a sofa,
1193600	1197920	I'm talking about content that might also be implicative to sexual behavior.
1197920	1203280	The problem is, although morally we might all have a clear idea where we stand, when it comes down to the line,
1203280	1209600	we will be challenged in our minds, and the law is even murkier, and it is swamped in loopholes,
1209600	1218120	and our good mate Bolinio here wasn't going to lose out on the greatest opportunity for monetary success, and fame that he has ever experienced.
1218120	1221080	I mean, look at him. He is having the time of his life.
1221480	1229480	We leave the previous chapter from a man whose career has prospered from the usage of his child, and yet is now facing down restrictions.
1229480	1237240	However, the demand for her as a public icon was not going to disappear, so he just had to rebrand a little.
1237240	1242760	One of the artists that constantly came up in reference when observing the evolution was the singer Anita.
1242760	1248240	According to her father, Melody seems to idolize the singer Anita, and wants to be much like her,
1248240	1254760	even to the point where she performed a lip sync version of the Anita song Bang, which is a decent banger to be fair,
1254760	1257640	but I shall not be playing it because it's probably copyrighted.
1257640	1262320	This was her new road, what her father branded as the non-sexual Anita.
1262320	1270800	In spite of this, the video in question still received rather negative ratings, because although it may not be breaching any agreements regarding sexualization,
1270800	1273360	its choreography can still be rather suggestive.
1273360	1277200	This is one of the biggest issues, and this is something that will arise again very soon.
1277200	1284400	What he's doing now is he's making Melody imitate singers that may be a bit sexually suggestive, and then labelling it under parody.
1284400	1286520	And this is his idea of a loophole.
1286520	1289560	At this point, you should realize that we've reached a conundrum.
1289560	1298160	Sexualization sells, but it's also an absolutely morally bankrupt thing to do, and doing it makes you an absolutely abhorrent human being when it's your child.
1298160	1304520	I mean, it's not a conundrum for us, but it was for Daddy here, and it was a conundrum because he had the authorities looking at him,
1304520	1310920	and he knew if he mobilized enough people against him, then it might be buy-buy money, and buy-buy daughter too.
1310920	1314040	But I think we all know which one was a priority to him.
1314040	1318640	So with this in mind, Papa, and probably many other people who could make a quick buck,
1318640	1322440	definitely took more precautions regarding how she was portrayed in the media.
1322440	1329360	I mean, this one's a rather innocent song about childhood love, this one's a more mature song about relationships.
1329360	1335240	Still a bit strange in how it's presented, and I find it hilarious how they couldn't even get a person with genuine acne,
1335240	1340320	and they had to add makeup spots like she was Nanny McPhee, but we'll let that one slide.
1340320	1348480	This time, I think what she did was still fairly questionable, but as observed in my previous videos, people become bored of attacking the same person,
1348480	1353200	and I guess what she did wasn't bad enough to rile up any further legal action against the family,
1353240	1361880	Though a pretty prominent declaration was the fact that she deleted her old videos, and released the statement that she would no longer be doing falsettos and quote parodies,
1361880	1368240	which was the lip-sync content that I described. A load of news outlets jumped on this, so I guess it was important.
1368240	1374160	I think the main reason she pulled the parodies, at least, was because she ended up with a copyright controversy with Rihanna,
1374160	1377560	where she had the lip-sync version pulled from circulation.
1377560	1381560	And looking back then, the comments on these videos, the consensus was very clear.
1381560	1387520	People thought she was being taken advantage of by her father. This is not a new thing. People in Brazil knew this.
1387520	1393560	She still ended up in controversy, such as her parody of the hands to myself, which once again, it was pretty terrible,
1393560	1400880	but it was that loophole of sexualization through parody, and I guess the fact that she wasn't gyrating the club meant that it was alright.
1400880	1406600	This is one of the dynamics that the internet has created, and this is why the online world is such a threat,
1406600	1410120	because people don't look at it the same, and on one hand, that's correct.
1410120	1415560	Me making a video for you guys to see is not the same as me performing this to a stadium.
1415560	1421720	But at the same time, the impersonality and the detachment can make people feel disconnected from the content.
1421720	1428280	If she'd done this live in front of hundreds of thousands of adult men, some of which with their hands pretty deep in their underwear,
1428280	1431320	I'm sure, the authorities probably would have swooped in immediately.
1436600	1445080	The problem is that MC Nelly Monk was probably quite aware of this, and pounced on the opportunity.
1445080	1453160	This is where we introduce Instagram. It appears that Melody and her sister Bella signed up to Instagram barely months after the initial incident with her father,
1453160	1458360	clearly with the intent of branching out the brand. With a lot of initial content being rather innocent,
1458360	1463640	it was just her posting where she was, what she was doing, and all that jazz. Nothing too provocative.
1463640	1470280	However, Instagram is a platform that I've never really dealt with on this channel, and that's really because I've never felt the impetus to.
1470280	1474440	I don't have an account, you know, why would anyone want to hear about my miserable life?
1474440	1482920	The thing is that a majority of the mega online sites take an extremely accelerated route not dissimilar to that of civilization.
1482920	1488520	We begin by exploring the websites cautiously, pleasure, leisure, just uploading content,
1488520	1493560	and then when enough people are browsing and enough algorithms exist, people try and work them out.
1493640	1500200	And if you've got something like a share button or a like button, suddenly people begin to see how they can obtain influence,
1500200	1508040	whether it's posting snide tweets, pretentious video essays, or in Instagram's case, a whole variety of stuff that I just find impossible to follow.
1510040	1517080	What will be inevitable is the creation of some hierarchy around some general appeal that's held within a demographic,
1517080	1521880	and once an appeal is worked out, people will try to one-up themselves in that industry.
1521880	1525400	That's what we saw with what eventually escalated to be Lil Tay.
1525400	1531880	You start with something that rides off its ridicule, such as the notion of a kid flexing with copious amounts of money,
1531880	1535880	and then it spirals, and the subjects become younger and more audacious,
1535880	1541560	and suddenly this person comes out and fulfills those prerequisites for attention.
1541560	1548200	Now, that's just a general rundown, and as said, the Instagram situation is the main cause for the video today.
1548200	1551800	But to give you a more experienced description of this specific situation,
1551800	1555240	I've decided to bring in an expert on the Instagram industry,
1555240	1558520	and, of course, an expert in bullying kids.
1558520	1560920	My friend, James Moriot. Take it away.
1562360	1566920	Hey, friends. I'm not James Moriot. I-I know. The resemblance is uncanny.
1566920	1571160	My name's Pootsie, and I'm a sometimes editor for Tro, I make my own videos on my channel.
1571160	1572120	Check them out, that'd be epic.
1572120	1577000	See, James was meant to be here, but decided instead to go on a vacation with his YouTube millions.
1577240	1582280	Hmm, I'm hungry. Maybe I should go to Cafe... Bean!
1583160	1585240	Regardless, I'll be filling in for him.
1585240	1587000	If you wanted to pursue a career in modeling,
1587000	1591880	the case used to be that you'd go through a modeling agency and generally look pretty photogenic,
1591880	1594520	or unfotogenic, depending on what they're going for.
1594520	1599000	With the introduction of Instagram, any swamp creature can just rise from the depths of the platform,
1599000	1602360	and with a little digital touching up of their photos, they can become a star.
1602360	1606440	Now, when I say digital touching up, I'm referring to a specific type of photo editing.
1606440	1609960	This is the type of photo editing that typically draws more attention to,
1609960	1613480	shall we say, more sensitive parts of the body?
1613480	1616680	It's thought editing, that's what it is. It's just thought editing.
1616680	1620360	Instagram clearly has an expectation, but anybody can do this.
1620360	1624840	And that's all fine and good until you realize who falls under the category of anybody.
1624840	1628920	Even though the site claims that they won't allow anybody under the age of 13 to sign up,
1628920	1631160	they won't really go out of their way to enforce it.
1631160	1636360	It's also very easy to just claim someone else runs your account, or even easier, lie about your age.
1636360	1639640	But one way or another, children and crowds arrived on the platform,
1639640	1642440	looking up to their idols like Belle Delphine.
1643480	1646360	You can see how the things they post could easily become sexualized.
1646360	1650200	Here you have this site that promotes and rewards sexualization of content,
1650200	1653960	and you have children coming in trying to follow suit and grow on this platform.
1653960	1657640	That's when you see rise to people like Danielle Kahn and, of course, Melody.
1657640	1660600	If you go to her Instagram now, you'll notice that a lot of the posts,
1660600	1663320	or some of the posts, are rather innocent.
1663320	1667400	That's because she or her management team deleted a lot of the more raunchy photos.
1667400	1669960	But only very recently is a response to public outcry.
1669960	1671160	Some of the pedophiles...
1671160	1671800	Sorry, sorry.
1671800	1673560	Melody's fans.
1673560	1674760	Some of Melody's fans.
1674760	1677560	I don't know how I got the word pedophile mixed up there.
1677560	1680760	Some of Melody's fans noticed that the content changed up a little bit,
1680760	1682520	and they're not having any of it.
1682520	1685720	A lot of comments on these now deleted photos were very creepy.
1685720	1687960	It was clear the type of people who were enjoying this content.
1687960	1691400	But after the controversy, now it's kind of hard to find those sort of comments.
1691400	1694120	Typically, now what you'll find is people condemning her father,
1694120	1696280	and a surprising amount of people who are her age
1696280	1698360	and just happen to look like they're in their mid-40s,
1698360	1700120	leaving comments about how much they love her.
1700120	1701000	Because that's normal.
1701000	1703880	Now, there's nothing inherently terrible about these comments,
1703880	1705880	but if you compare them to the type of comments that I,
1705880	1708440	or literally anybody else, gets on a daily basis,
1708440	1711960	you can see something a little bit fishy is going on here.
1711960	1713640	Now, I don't want to be the one to say it,
1713640	1716040	but I don't think Pablo's 12.
1716040	1716280	He's...
1717160	1718920	He's looking like he could have a mortgage.
1718920	1720360	He just matured very quickly.
1720360	1725240	The sexualization of Melody's Instagram got so bad that people she worked with,
1725240	1726840	like Felipe Nito,
1726840	1729240	literally deleted all of the videos with her in them,
1729240	1732280	because he felt disgusted by how sexualized she was.
1732280	1735320	He even contacted her father and told him this needs to stop,
1735320	1736600	or I'm going to do this,
1736600	1737560	and it didn't stop.
1737560	1739320	And rightfully, he doesn't blame her for this.
1739320	1740680	He blames Bolinho.
1741800	1742840	Big Bolinho.
1742840	1748440	While researching this, one comment that I've seen throughout YouTube, Instagram,
1748440	1751640	some of her really raunchy TikToks that are still up,
1751640	1755720	are comments from genuine children around her age that are questioning
1755720	1759000	why they don't look as mature or act as mature as she does.
1759000	1760680	See, children on these platforms,
1760680	1765000	acting more mature than they are for attention and likes and whatever else,
1765000	1768760	it perpetuates this cycle of other children coming onto these platforms,
1768760	1770360	seeing how these children are acting,
1770360	1772680	and questioning why they don't act that way themselves.
1772680	1775080	It's encouraging kids to grow up faster than they should.
1775080	1778440	There are studies directly related to this and how it affects a developing mind,
1778440	1780840	and the results of which shouldn't be ignored.
1780840	1782920	Even if you're able to ignore the fact that more adults
1782920	1786520	are singing along to Melody's hit singles than actual kids her own age,
1786520	1787880	I wonder why that is.
1787880	1790200	Uncle Lester, please stop playing MC Melody.
1790200	1793080	Children acting older than they are is not simply pet-obeyed,
1793080	1794840	it's honestly an epidemic.
1794840	1796280	These kids will develop differently,
1796280	1799320	and I'm sure Melody's going to grow up to have horrible psychological problems,
1799320	1800600	if she doesn't already.
1800600	1804680	But on the bright side, at least MC Bolinho is making fat stacks off of her,
1804760	1809080	so maybe one day you can pay for a good therapist or another chain.
1809080	1810040	One or the other, really.
1810040	1812200	If you're below the age of 18 and you're watching this,
1812840	1814360	hold on to your innocence,
1814360	1815720	hold on to your childhood,
1815720	1819240	hold on to anything that makes you not this.
1819240	1821000	Because as much as you might want to grow up now,
1821000	1823400	childhood is a very important stage of life.
1823400	1825320	But there is still more to be explored here,
1825320	1827000	so I'll pass it back to Turo.
1827000	1828600	James Moore, it f**ks kids.
1828600	1829480	Thank you, James.
1829480	1832200	Be sure to check out his channel in the pinned comment.
1832200	1834200	And as James has really outlined,
1834200	1837000	the reason the Instagram content became more sexual
1837000	1840120	was the same reason why Melody was dropping all fours in the club.
1840120	1841160	It was the market,
1841160	1844280	and the father noticed that market and responded accordingly.
1844280	1845400	And like the first time,
1845400	1847880	he knows Melody is still in the public eye,
1847880	1850920	and even if he can't use her one way, he'll find another.
1850920	1853400	In this instance, no one cared until the outcry.
1853400	1855640	Instagram benefit because it's a ton of traffic,
1855640	1859240	and unless there's real outrage against the platform, who cares?
1859240	1863160	MC Wellyjunk gets to release a few more tripe singles about how rich he is,
1863160	1864760	and everyone's winning.
1864760	1865480	Or are they?
1873240	1878120	The thing is that exploitation for business purposes is all that the father knows,
1878120	1880600	and he was just adapting to what he knew,
1880600	1883800	and the Instagram platform opened up an international doorway,
1883800	1888040	because your appeal doesn't solely rely on a Portuguese-speaking market.
1888040	1891160	Which on one hand, it probably opened up a whole new form of income,
1891160	1892280	many new opportunities,
1892280	1896520	but at the same time, you're opening yourself up to a new tidal wave of outrage
1896520	1899560	with people who are not familiar with your established infamy.
1899560	1903320	Still, she has accumulated over 3 million followers, and she's 11.
1903320	1904680	Just let that sink in.
1904680	1906200	Instagram hasn't really done anything,
1906200	1909800	and she may not be prone to online predators on that platform,
1909800	1913080	but you know there are a lot of seedy individuals viewing the content,
1913080	1916200	and at the end of the day, to an extent, that is beyond our control.
1916200	1918360	But at the same time, she's a child,
1918360	1922520	and the father is morally dubious in acknowledging these consequences,
1922520	1925000	because I refuse to believe he's not aware,
1925000	1926840	and I will call him out for that.
1926840	1931080	One of the many problems is that we have just become so desensitized to a lot of these things,
1931080	1934680	it means they pass under the radar even when they're right in front of our eyes,
1934680	1939080	mainly because the online detachment doesn't make us realise the real implications,
1939080	1941800	particularly when it becomes expected of the culture,
1941800	1944760	and what happens suddenly doesn't become as much of a reach.
1944760	1947800	Clickbait thumbnails and exaggerated narratives are a norm,
1947800	1950200	and so we no longer pay close attention to them,
1950200	1953720	they almost become a punchline rather than an actual concern.
1953720	1958280	On top of this, the thing about Melody is that it was all rooted in that funk culture.
1958280	1961720	From when she was 8, she had that audience who knew her,
1961720	1963480	and knew what they wanted from her,
1963480	1967640	and all this Instagram incident is, is a shifting of that delivery.
1967640	1969800	It is the same expectations.
1969800	1973640	All of this history is important to note, as it should document a trend.
1973640	1977160	The father was deeply invested in this, whether it's for the money or the fame,
1977160	1980120	or whether he wants to release more intolerable tracks.
1980120	1982600	It doesn't matter, looking at the situation today,
1982600	1986600	I would not be taking any chances, and neither was anyone else by the looks of it.
1986600	1988120	Under pressure from those around him,
1988120	1991000	following a couple interviews where the mother voiced her concerns,
1991000	1994440	the father wrote a letter apologising for the mother's absence from their life,
1994440	1998360	and stated that he was working with the authorities to hand over custody to her.
1998360	2000680	What will happen following this is hard to say exactly,
2000680	2003000	but it might be a step in the right direction.
2003000	2007560	On top of this, there are so many cultural problems that can be outlined by observing this situation,
2007560	2011400	many of which yield from the society that Melody has experienced herself.
2011400	2014920	One of the constant defences that I found when dealing with these situations,
2014920	2018040	whether it was from that twat Emerson Martins, or the father,
2018040	2021960	or anyone else defending the actions, is that it's part of the culture,
2021960	2024680	and these people are just representing that culture,
2024680	2026760	and the experiences that come along with it.
2026760	2031560	Those who are trying to shut them down are the oppressors, breaking apart that defiance.
2031560	2036360	They are the underdogs, punching up with their 8-year-old exploitation.
2036360	2041320	This has been an argument ever-present, with a lot of discussion related to hip-hop.
2041320	2047880	Whether it's rap or funk, its whole demeanour is representing experiences that are not pleasant,
2047880	2049560	and that is part of a culture.
2049560	2053160	Plenty of rappers do that, and that is fine,
2053160	2058120	but at the same time, it's important to know where to draw the line when it comes to these topics,
2058120	2061880	and it's important that the cultural argument doesn't become a scapegoat
2061880	2064360	to conduct fairly heinous actions.
2064360	2067080	Just because Pusha T has sold some drugs in his time,
2067080	2071000	doesn't mean that 6ix9ine gets a free pass to underage intercourse.
2071000	2076120	And if funk is representing experiences of children sexualizing and adultifying themselves,
2076120	2081720	whether MC Toy or Melody, or many more on the list that have made this twisted hierarchy,
2081720	2085640	then they may want to look at themselves and look at the experiences they create.
2085640	2090360	On one hand, the fact that it might be culturally represented does not shift agency,
2090360	2093480	because this in itself is a relatively recent situation,
2093480	2098760	and many of the people participating in this clearly had the free will to decipher that it was wrong,
2098760	2103400	and they were exposed to the sober criticism of others, and they ignored it.
2103400	2107320	The content was not merely representative, it was indulgent,
2107320	2112760	and it was glorifying a concept deeply broken, and marketing it to other vulnerable children.
2112760	2117800	There's a vast difference in talking about these experiences and shining a light on them,
2117800	2121560	rather than implicitly encouraging others to go out and do it themselves,
2121560	2125720	and marketing it to other vulnerable children and questionable adults,
2125720	2127960	and suggesting that this should be the dream.
2127960	2133480	I mean, Emerson Martins called his mansion the dreams factory, whatever that's meant to mean.
2133480	2136280	That is a dangerous narrative to create.
2136280	2141160	However, on the other hand, the fact that many people clearly see this as a route out of such
2141160	2145800	a deprived, hopeless lifestyle may be a message to society to wake up,
2145800	2149320	and although condemning this specific incident is the right thing to do,
2149320	2153800	I know that I do not know the exact details of the situation,
2153800	2157800	and people who are close to the situation have to look at this and ask themselves,
2157800	2160600	what drives a culture like that to arise?
2160600	2163240	What drives people to affirm that lifestyle?
2163240	2167400	Why is there a demand for it, and why has this network been created?
2167400	2170920	The situation in Brazil can be pretty dire, depending on where you are,
2170920	2173400	and although absolute poverty has been decreasing,
2173400	2175880	income inequality is still extremely high,
2175880	2180840	and it will breed a mentality where that successful lifestyle is glorifying,
2180840	2183160	particularly when it's enabled by an audience,
2183160	2187880	or has prominent figures that it will drive to obtain at all costs,
2187880	2191160	even if that means sacrificing your children's dignity.
2191160	2194600	I don't want to deny anyone a chance to escape poverty,
2194600	2196920	but the means have to justify the ends,
2196920	2198760	and I feel this is the wrong way,
2198760	2200680	but when showing something is wrong,
2200680	2203240	it's not just a case of showing people why it's wrong,
2203240	2206840	but it's also a question of showing people a better path forward.
2206840	2209240	I can't specify what path that might be,
2209240	2212600	because that is a dive into politics so deep,
2212600	2217800	that it would probably require more than just a twat Saturday microphone to uncover.
2217800	2222280	On top of this, it should be time for sites like Instagram to see some initiative.
2222280	2224040	According to the terms and conditions,
2224040	2227080	the sign-up age is 13, and Melody is not 13,
2227080	2230360	and although her dad's probably the owner of the account to loophole this,
2230360	2232920	and we shouldn't just ban pictures of children from existing,
2232920	2237000	there is clear contextual detail that should make this situation rather simple,
2237000	2240760	and once again, without real action, there will be no real lessons learned.
2240760	2243400	The father constantly sought the success of his peers
2243400	2247240	by emulating the lowest tropes of that genre,
2247240	2249480	and as we live in a more interconnected world,
2249480	2252520	that aim doesn't change just the techniques,
2252520	2253560	and that's the point.
2253560	2256920	Melody's more suggestive content was a general appeal
2256920	2260680	to very seedy figures dressed up in a notion of cultural defiance,
2260680	2264040	and every genre like that walks the line all over the world,
2264040	2268440	and the genres that influence the Brazilian ones that we witness today did the same,
2268440	2271000	but people should call it out the same.
2271000	2273240	You cannot remove that agency,
2273240	2276680	because from the get-go, it's clear that MC Belligno,
2276680	2280200	aka Tiago Abreu, had no discernible talent,
2280200	2284040	and although the daughters weren't anything special either, I would say,
2284040	2287320	they had something that he could compromise on to make them famous,
2287320	2288600	and that was their youth,
2288600	2291960	and that's where many other people with dignity would draw the line,
2291960	2293720	and it's clear that over the last few years,
2293720	2297000	in spite of the constant controversies facing down the daughters,
2297000	2300760	he has been unfazed and only sought to maintain that image,
2300760	2303880	while trying to sidestep authorities at every moment
2303880	2305720	by tweaking a few of the details,
2305720	2308360	whether it was parodies, whether it was Instagram,
2308360	2309960	whether it was anything else,
2309960	2313400	and many Brazilians have been aware of this for ages,
2313400	2315320	and although this is only news to us now,
2315320	2316600	with the change in custody,
2316600	2319400	I hope it will also be a turning point for her life,
2319400	2322120	and it's important for people to carry on keeping an eye on her,
2322120	2323960	and now there's a more global perspective,
2323960	2325960	on top of the presence from Felipe Neto,
2325960	2328120	which has also provided positive influence,
2328120	2330520	not just with the family from the psychological support,
2330520	2334520	but on social media such as having her content removed from rather seedy sites,
2334520	2337640	and this has given me a hope that there might be a light at the end of the tunnel
2337640	2340120	for Gabriela Severino Abreu.
2342200	2345720	Before we end, I want to say that this video was sponsored by ExpressVPN.
2345720	2348840	Now, honestly, I've never really been interested in VPNs,
2348840	2352360	but now I'm a personality with loads of people hitting me up and looking for me,
2352360	2354360	and also a lot to research.
2354360	2357000	It's kinda a necessity that I do have something like this,
2357000	2359000	that can shield me from hackers and snoopers,
2359000	2362520	but also give me access to sites that I might not have access to otherwise.
2362520	2366360	So in a way, I'm glad ExpressVPN hit me up and offered me a good old sponsorship,
2366360	2368600	because I am a cheap bastard.
2368600	2370280	Being the critical man that I am,
2370280	2373080	and obviously given the narratives I've spoken about in the past,
2373080	2374680	especially regarding better help,
2374680	2377480	I wanted to use their services first, and they let me.
2377480	2380840	I've been pretty happy, and it does make me feel more secure.
2380840	2383160	It helps me traverse problems such as the restriction
2383160	2385480	that the EU places on certain news sites,
2385480	2387880	I'm someone who will regularly need to consume media
2387880	2390200	from obscure American media outlets,
2390200	2392920	and ExpressVPN can enable me to do that.
2392920	2396280	If I want to watch my sad old man political shows in the UK,
2396280	2399560	but the BBC won't recognise my citizenship due to my location,
2399560	2402360	then I can do that, with Article 13 coming in.
2402360	2404520	I mean, I don't know how much I'm gonna need it,
2404520	2405960	but I'm grateful that it's there.
2405960	2408760	I really enjoy the service, its interface is simple,
2408760	2411480	I haven't experienced any real lag while using it,
2411480	2414600	it's to the point, nice little cheeky design,
2414600	2418360	quick to connect, has locations in around 90 countries,
2418360	2420200	not that you'd need that many, but it's there,
2420200	2422280	and they keep your content completely private,
2422280	2424280	with no real restrictions on what you can do,
2424280	2426040	and my experience isn't the only one,
2426040	2427960	they are pretty revered all round.
2427960	2429960	I haven't had any problems, but if you do,
2429960	2432280	they have customer support, which is pretty neat.
2432280	2436040	I did test it out, I sent a message at 1.39am my time,
2436040	2437880	and they responded in the space of a minute,
2437880	2440840	so they're clearly receptive, and I think it was a human.
2440840	2443320	These robots are getting smarter though, mind you.
2443320	2445480	Even on simple things like filling in a form,
2445480	2447720	I've found sometimes they can grab my IP,
2447720	2449480	and although it may not seem malicious,
2449480	2451480	it's nice to have that extra veil of privacy,
2451560	2453480	and that's something that anyone can encounter,
2453480	2456360	so really, I can see it having a purpose for everyone,
2456360	2457320	to an extent.
2457320	2460840	As an app, it's pretty much usable on every device,
2460840	2465080	Windows, iOS, Android, Macs, Linux,
2465080	2466440	router, and more,
2466440	2468120	I mean, I don't really know how many more there are,
2468120	2469800	but you know, there probably is more.
2469800	2472120	There are also browser extensions,
2472120	2474360	you can get Chrome and Firefox,
2474360	2475640	not Safari though,
2475640	2479000	because people who use Safari like pineapple on pizza,
2479080	2481960	and I made sure we didn't let them in on this,
2481960	2483880	but even if you do have Safari,
2483880	2486120	you'll obviously be able to get it on Mac regardless,
2486120	2488840	it's just the browser extensions they don't have on Safari.
2488840	2490760	Overall, I haven't had any problems,
2490760	2492280	and if you are looking for a VPN,
2492280	2493800	I would recommend it.
2493800	2496120	Normally, prices are $7 a month,
2496120	2497160	but if you're not happy,
2497160	2499320	there is a 30-day money-back guarantee,
2499320	2502520	and if you use my very spicy code by going on the URL,
2502520	2505320	expressvpn.com slash tro,
2505320	2506920	that's slash t-r-o,
2506920	2507960	as in my initials,
2507960	2511000	you can get the first three months off a one-year package,
2511000	2512920	and the links will be in the description
2512920	2515640	to make it nice and accessible for all you delightful people.
2515640	2516920	That's all I've got to say about that.
2516920	2517480	Once again,
2518520	2522840	good on the lads at ExpressVPN for helping me in my time of need.
2522840	2524280	Definitely recommend.
2524280	2525320	If you're looking for something like that,
2525320	2527640	if you feel like it's going to be something that might benefit you,
2527640	2529800	then yeah, I'd recommend ExpressVPN.
2529800	2531320	Anyhow, if you made it to the end of the video,
2531320	2532440	big thanks,
2532440	2533560	mega shout out to James,
2534840	2535720	thank you for appearing,
2535800	2538920	I'm gonna leave his link in the pinned comment,
2538920	2540600	and I want you to go and send him some love.
2540600	2543240	I also want you guys to go and send the editors some love,
2543240	2547080	they have done a fantastic, stellar job as always,
2547080	2549480	and it wouldn't be the same without them.
2549480	2552360	On top of this, I want to thank my Patreons,
2552360	2554280	special thanks to Connor,
2554280	2556680	I also want to shout out some hullabaloo,
2556680	2558600	and a special thanks to Ryan,
2558600	2560360	and also a shout out to Brandon,
2560360	2564360	my $50 and $100 Patreons consecutively,
2564360	2565800	both fantastic,
2565800	2569160	I'm very honoured, very flattered indeed,
2569160	2572600	and you can't really top that sort of dedication,
2572600	2574520	so respect it a lot.
2574520	2576280	Anyhow, I don't have too much else to say,
2576280	2577800	so I'll just see you around guys,
2577800	2579880	have a fantastic day,
2579880	2581080	I'm The Right Opinion,
2581080	2583000	and I'll see you in the next one.
2594360	2596360	I'll see you in the next one.
