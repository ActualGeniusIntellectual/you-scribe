Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:09.480 --> 00:13.800
too much free time, and today we talk about the ever existent, strange obsession with

00:13.800 --> 00:18.360
child stars, because if there's one thing that I doubt the internet will ever rid itself

00:18.360 --> 00:23.160
of, well, it's that. I've spoken about children online in the past, and I'll likely speak

00:23.160 --> 00:27.360
about them in the future. I'd say in my new style the last time I properly covered this

00:27.360 --> 00:32.460
sensation was in my Lil Tay video, which once again attributed a strange fixation to the

00:32.460 --> 00:38.080
idea of young kids doing adult things. The point of that video was to document how fascinated

00:38.080 --> 00:42.340
we become when someone behaves in a way that is not necessarily expected of them. Whenever

00:42.340 --> 00:46.340
you are doing something that has an appeal that no one else is doing, you will typically

00:46.340 --> 00:51.000
gain fame for it, and at that point you introduce the factors that will actually determine the

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
longevity. However, with someone like Lil Tay, the whole system is broken, the fact

00:55.000 --> 00:59.800
that it is driven off being more and more audacious, it is destined to slide into an

00:59.800 --> 01:04.720
absolute burnout, or you end up not being able to keep up. The outcomes on either side

01:04.720 --> 01:08.600
are not particularly rosy, and if none of that fails to kill your career, growing up

01:08.600 --> 01:13.100
will. Child fame is not something that really should be glorified. We'll always need children

01:13.100 --> 01:18.040
in our media, particularly in areas such as film, to make sure they are provided representation.

01:18.040 --> 01:22.840
At the same time, the unique mental circumstances that a developing child encounters cannot

01:22.840 --> 01:27.340
be discounted, and cannot be exposed to the ravenous hordes of internet dwellers like

01:27.340 --> 01:31.320
many of us YouTubers. There are nuances to this argument, and I'll probably address

01:31.320 --> 01:35.500
them another time, particularly when that person might be able to exert adult levels

01:35.500 --> 01:39.920
of influence, but most of the time, these people are just puppets for fame hungry parents

01:39.920 --> 01:44.640
or siblings, who want to find ways to exploit that childhood reliance to make them conduct

01:44.640 --> 01:49.400
certain actions that arouse online interest, and use the fact that they're not autonomous

01:49.400 --> 01:54.000
to claim any profit and benefits. It's a scummy, but unsurprisingly common dynamic

01:54.000 --> 01:57.680
that you'll find, and these kids are often the ones who will take the mental fall from

01:57.680 --> 02:02.980
it. However, Lil Tay was, as predicted, a brief fad that was in itself an escalation

02:02.980 --> 02:07.800
of the juxtaposition between adult behaviour and childish appearance, one that could inevitably

02:07.800 --> 02:12.040
not be topped, and left a trail of destruction in the culture that had ultimately set herself

02:12.040 --> 02:16.920
up. However, the death of one market always leads to the rise of a new one, and the thing

02:16.920 --> 02:21.680
is that although many trends are short lived, they are almost always born out of some longer

02:21.680 --> 02:26.760
term human interest. These long term human interests provide anchors, and unfortunately

02:26.760 --> 02:30.360
the fascination with children being placed in environments that would seem surreal for

02:30.360 --> 02:35.320
them is a consistent one, and today, more than ever, this has pushed into a serious

02:35.320 --> 02:39.060
boundary. I'm going to leave this narrative on hold, because the new market leads us to

02:39.060 --> 02:45.720
a very interesting individual, who goes by the Instagram username of melody officiad3,

02:45.720 --> 02:51.980
or melody officiad3, I guess. Now, Melody is a Brazilian figure online, her real name

02:51.980 --> 02:57.320
is Gabriela Severino, and according to the very quaint Wikipedia page, she's a singer

02:57.320 --> 03:02.460
and songwriter, all at the age of 11. Wow, that's a very impressive feat. She has released

03:02.460 --> 03:06.760
a plethora of singles, ones that I'm sure will reach at some point in this video, a

03:06.760 --> 03:10.760
few of these songs have performed fairly well on the Brazilian charts, she's been around

03:10.760 --> 03:17.120
since 2015 from the age of 8, so she's already had more of an esteemed career than me. One

03:17.120 --> 03:22.280
day morning sun, one day. However, today as we'll see, she's in the YouTube headlines,

03:22.280 --> 03:26.440
well in this video at least, so the right opinion headlines, for certain conduct that

03:26.440 --> 03:32.540
is much more questionable than just writing songs. You see, I have a friend, I know, surprising,

03:32.540 --> 03:37.320
he goes by the name of Marriot, James Marriot, and he made this video on someone he branded

03:37.320 --> 03:42.700
as Daniel Cohen's sister, which you know, I used my genius to decipher, it wasn't actually

03:42.700 --> 03:46.780
Daniel Cohen's sister. But besides the point, it's spicy clickbait, and although I love

03:46.780 --> 03:51.560
a good James Marriot video, I didn't quite have the time, so I passed up on it then.

03:51.560 --> 03:56.000
And anyway, he didn't need my patronage, his video was enticing enough for a couple million

03:56.000 --> 04:00.120
other people, and he is succeeding off it, and I'm happy for him. But it would be really

04:00.120 --> 04:03.680
great if we could get this video to 3 million, just to piss him off. Now, what caught my

04:03.680 --> 04:07.840
eye was when Marriot contacted a group chat that I was a part of, with the development

04:07.840 --> 04:12.980
detailing this. The information that actually the publication had led to action, and suddenly

04:12.980 --> 04:17.720
whatever video he had made on it seemed to be documenting something much more serious.

04:17.720 --> 04:22.040
Now, in this DM, it said her Instagram was removed, and at the time it was, however,

04:22.040 --> 04:27.000
it has since been returned, with a lot more of the suspect images removed. I mean, if

04:27.000 --> 04:31.240
I had taken heed of the thumbnail, I should have been alerted fairly promptly, but I didn't,

04:31.240 --> 04:35.640
after all clickbait is exaggerative, and you don't pay close attention to these things.

04:35.640 --> 04:39.260
But really, from the start, this should have been a huge cause for alarm, and yet instead

04:39.260 --> 04:44.560
of alarm, she has amassed a total of 3.7 million followers on Instagram, and comments that

04:44.560 --> 04:49.960
are a bit unsavoury. It appears in this specific situation, the real catalyst for this development

04:49.960 --> 04:55.740
was the YouTuber Felipe Neto, who has approximately 30 million subscribers, and therefore a tad

04:55.740 --> 04:59.880
bit more clout than Mr Marriot, though there's still time James, there's still time. The

04:59.880 --> 05:05.540
thing is, in my Lil Tay video, I discussed a lot about familial influence. As a sensation

05:05.540 --> 05:09.760
it seems, on one hand, it is impossible to stifle. However, one of the things that had

05:09.760 --> 05:13.740
occurred to me when researching this topic is a very new cultural discussion, and one

05:13.740 --> 05:19.800
that I would love to have today. So, join me as we deconstruct the Instagram of Melody

05:19.800 --> 05:24.940
Oficial, her career, her history, her family, the environment that she has yielded from,

05:24.940 --> 05:28.860
the culture that has created her, and how this has manifested into the situation that

05:28.860 --> 05:33.140
we have witnessed today, one that has allegedly snowballed to the point where authorities

05:33.140 --> 05:37.800
have involved themselves. That is rather important information. This is a lot to unpack, and

05:37.800 --> 05:41.360
I'm not entirely sure how I'm going to do it, but I'm a determined person, and

05:41.360 --> 05:45.400
it shall be done. There's a lot more to this than just a James Marriot video, though

05:45.400 --> 05:49.120
as always, it's a start, the sexy bastard. Let's go.

05:49.120 --> 06:02.400
In 2011, Tayo Cruz released the song Hangover. Generally, it left me with a rather sad taste

06:02.400 --> 06:06.500
in my mouth, it seemed a little too overproduced and dizzying, and although it may have worked

06:06.500 --> 06:11.080
better back then, it didn't perform too great commercially, and signalled the stagnation

06:11.080 --> 06:15.520
of one of music's rising stars. Why am I saying this? Well, it's the first thing

06:15.520 --> 06:33.600
I encountered when researching Melanie's father, MC Belligno. MC Belligno, namely Tiago Abreu,

06:33.600 --> 06:38.920
is a Brazilian musician. We use the term musician very liberally in this household, but I have

06:38.920 --> 06:43.580
to give him credit where credit is due, he is creating music. However, to understand

06:43.580 --> 06:48.100
his star, you really do fully have to be invested in Brazilian music, and honestly,

06:48.100 --> 06:52.440
we don't really have too much time to completely deconstruct every single cultural element

06:52.440 --> 06:56.740
that creates it, but it is an interesting discussion to have. It is not exactly clear

06:56.740 --> 07:03.340
when MC Belligno's music career began, however it's quite evident that he enjoys his music,

07:03.340 --> 07:07.800
and enjoys social media. The first definitive YouTube channel I found of his was called

07:07.800 --> 07:13.820
MC Belligno Funk de Curti, which I was not sure of its translation, so I consulted my

07:13.820 --> 07:18.420
Portuguese language expert who told me that it was just really a name, and probably relating

07:18.420 --> 07:23.360
to the Funk genre which we'll discuss soon, but that didn't satisfy me, so I consulted

07:23.360 --> 07:28.880
Google Translate that decided the translation was MC Belly Funk, which I highly doubt is

07:28.880 --> 07:34.440
his actual name, but on the other hand, MC Belly Funk is clearly someone who is a very

07:34.440 --> 07:39.480
typical product of a culture that he is far to invest in, to the point that it's borderline

07:39.480 --> 07:44.080
a meme. In an old biography I found the very interesting information that he is actually

07:44.080 --> 07:47.640
a single father, which is definitely something that we can bring up late, but it's clear

07:47.640 --> 07:52.760
that for a long time he has been chasing a dream, and yet it just didn't take off, probably

07:52.760 --> 07:57.440
because it should be quite clear that he isn't individually the most talented. The first

07:57.440 --> 08:02.240
video was uploaded, which I assume was his own music pasted over pictures of women, which

08:02.240 --> 08:08.280
I assume was the music video, with a female name and the location Pochacatu, which apparently

08:08.280 --> 08:13.840
is a city near Sao Paulo. This is content that frankly, I do not know the meaning exactly,

08:13.840 --> 08:18.080
but judging from its general appearance, it appears that it was being fairly derivative.

08:18.080 --> 08:22.880
What do I mean? Well let's talk about musical culture a lot. When MC Belly Funk decided

08:22.880 --> 08:26.720
to release his first track, the Brazilian charts were pretty Americanised, and it was

08:26.720 --> 08:31.240
hard to distinguish a lot of the singles from the more English speaking markets. This has

08:31.240 --> 08:35.760
been fairly common, particularly with hip-hop, which is what, if anything, I would describe

08:35.760 --> 08:40.560
the musician as. A lot of Brazilian hip-hop, although without a doubt idiosyncratic in

08:40.560 --> 08:45.960
its own rights, still has a lot of culturally defining content that cannot be ignored. However,

08:45.960 --> 08:50.320
as you can probably tell, there is an overarching theme, given the fact that it is rooted in

08:50.320 --> 08:55.920
a lot of struggle. In the US, rap was rooted in that defiant cultural celebration against

08:55.920 --> 09:00.960
an oppressive institutional power who tried to deny what they felt was their identity.

09:00.960 --> 09:05.480
This celebration, however, has also become increasingly immersed in many of these celebrations

09:05.480 --> 09:10.580
that related to more universal content, such as partying, drinking, and what Mon might

09:10.580 --> 09:16.160
describe as bitches. Because the content is more universal, and because the content is

09:16.160 --> 09:20.960
more universal, it is thus more marketable, and there are many nuances to this, but know

09:20.960 --> 09:25.960
that this is a universal trend, particularly during the years of the early 2010s, when

09:25.960 --> 09:30.680
watered-down rappers like Pitbull and Flowrider were at their most profitable. It no longer

09:30.680 --> 09:35.860
became about experience, merely being able to rap about pouring it up and creating fantasies

09:35.860 --> 09:40.380
for your audiences to become invested over some Red One-produced beat. There are very

09:40.380 --> 09:45.380
few people who are successful in this industry, mainly because it's a set of very complex

09:45.380 --> 09:50.080
algorithms with a user-dictated market, and if people's appetite isn't there, your

09:50.080 --> 09:54.840
career will just be brutally cut. Look at Katy Perry, for example. Music on principle

09:54.840 --> 09:59.520
isn't the hardest to make, but it is incredibly hard to master, and even harder to create

09:59.520 --> 10:03.380
a lasting career out of, and therefore you'll find a lot of artists who are trying to break

10:03.380 --> 10:08.060
into the industry by creating a conglomerate of cultural peels falling from whatever they

10:08.060 --> 10:12.880
view as successful, and that's what MC Smellychunk was doing here. The thing is, he's just

10:12.880 --> 10:17.480
like any other amateur artist who has a checklist of hip-hop tropes to talk about. There was

10:17.480 --> 10:21.800
no way that as an individual creator he was going to break through into the industry.

10:21.800 --> 10:25.380
It's incredibly hard unless you're picked up by a label that can provide production

10:25.380 --> 10:29.920
value to launch you, and you actually have that personality, or you have some sincere

10:29.920 --> 10:35.480
bedroom pop vibe that seems all nice and cozy. This is what MC DeliPunk probably ascertained

10:35.480 --> 10:40.140
at some point. He did actually make some higher production content which gained views, but

10:40.140 --> 10:44.300
also some rather negative feedback. It's on a channel named Funkaton, which I assumed

10:44.300 --> 10:47.800
at first might have been some third party, but it was actually on a channel that used

10:47.800 --> 10:52.920
to be called Tom Produsoyns, with the description giving him the full credit. On top of this

10:52.920 --> 10:57.520
I feel that many of the views came after, and it was still subpar content, created out

10:57.520 --> 11:02.340
of some self-obsession he clearly had, and I say this because of the numerous compilations

11:02.340 --> 11:06.480
he has of him topless, and the fact that his Facebook reads like a Tinder bio. I'm beginning

11:06.480 --> 11:10.740
to think his musical career was just because of some masquerade of ultra-masculinity over

11:10.740 --> 11:14.980
the genuine longing for a romantic relationship. I guess those dating apps weren't enough

11:14.980 --> 11:19.640
for him. However, he did have a couple children, these children were called Bella and Gabriella,

11:19.640 --> 11:24.160
a nice little rhyming scheme going on there, and he still had a clear dream that he wanted

11:24.160 --> 11:29.320
to chase. He kinda had that grip on the industry, so at some point he decided to integrate his

11:29.320 --> 11:35.720
two daughters. Now the 2010s were a real revival of the child stars that we hadn't seen since

11:35.720 --> 11:41.020
the 1970s, and social media like Facebook and YouTube provided a real platform for this.

11:41.040 --> 11:46.200
It appears that this is where melody was swooped up. We can typically date this around 2015,

11:46.200 --> 11:50.360
I'm not exactly sure where the growth came from, but at some point the corporate shark

11:50.360 --> 11:55.320
smelled the money and came swimming. Although MC Big Chonk seemed limited in his talents,

11:55.320 --> 11:59.480
he clearly had connections, if they could make him look successful while still sounding

11:59.480 --> 12:04.700
shite. Now at first it seems our good MC Papa here was just trying to cash in on the whole

12:04.700 --> 12:09.960
child star narrative, you know, the sort of cheap Rebecca Black-esque song which is purposefully

12:09.980 --> 12:14.500
amateurish and laughable. However, there were reports on this, and there were also videos

12:14.500 --> 12:17.260
supposedly demonstrating her vocal ability.

12:24.260 --> 12:30.820
She really just looks in pain to be honest. These were the clips that are credited for making her a star, and to my knowledge

12:30.820 --> 12:34.940
they were originally posted to Facebook, but I couldn't find them, so I had to find their

12:34.940 --> 12:39.800
YouTube re-uploads, but with this they made a music video and that song was, I guess, a hit.

12:39.800 --> 12:46.220
They started cavorting with the stars, and this opened doors for melody and her father. Papa probably saw an opportunity for

12:46.520 --> 12:52.360
himself to profit off this sudden success, and although making an eight-year-old superstar seemed rather objectionable,

12:52.360 --> 12:56.800
I guess it wasn't exceptional enough to gather anyone's immediate attention.

12:56.840 --> 13:04.240
But when you don't treat a tumour, it grows, and grows, and oh my god, it's downhill from here

13:04.240 --> 13:06.240
my friends.

13:11.500 --> 13:14.660
One of the things I found in research was that there are a lot of popular

13:15.180 --> 13:21.780
Brazilian children. A word that is thrown around a lot in the articles that I read was the word funk and funk heroes.

13:21.820 --> 13:25.220
Now, this is not the funk that we would typically associate with the word.

13:25.220 --> 13:30.220
No, this is much more linked to these terms funk kaleoka and funk ostintaso, which are both

13:30.600 --> 13:36.160
variations of the sort of rap genre we're looking at, and there are many more variations of funk that we will probably encounter today.

13:36.160 --> 13:41.280
This is something that MC Telebunk was very invested in, as shown by his creative outputs.

13:41.280 --> 13:48.040
And this is the thing, child stars are inescapable, especially in the era of the internet, and I accept them to an extent, and that's

13:48.040 --> 13:49.840
why in spite of the extremely young age,

13:49.840 --> 13:57.080
I'm sure people just write it off, because by 2015, young child stars making subpar music had been pretty normalized in the mainstream

13:57.400 --> 13:59.400
industry. So how do we get from there?

14:00.220 --> 14:02.220
to here?

14:06.560 --> 14:12.240
Well, you see, as said, there seems to be a budding market for children in Brazilian music. Researching this,

14:12.240 --> 14:19.080
I found a network of MCs, particularly surrounding the Sao Paulo area, and this included a variety of artists. MC

14:19.080 --> 14:26.440
Brincredo, MC Pikachu, MC Bin Laden, all are claimed to be specializing in the funk music in question. At the turn of

14:26.780 --> 14:32.600
2015, these artists were really gathering steam. However, this market was becoming more and more ridiculous.

14:32.600 --> 14:37.040
This isn't just something that has developed into the situation that we are observing today,

14:37.040 --> 14:43.800
this was a situation three and a half years ago. And you know, I said, as musicians go, Melody was fairly young.

14:43.800 --> 14:44.300
Well,

14:44.300 --> 14:49.480
I actually managed to find a younger one who was six years old, who released a song that translates as

14:49.600 --> 14:57.040
Slap on the Bum. Apparently, this one was co-signed by business called RP Prodatura, while Melody was under BM

14:57.340 --> 15:04.300
Prodatura. It seems there's just this market of record labels swooping up children to make a quick buck. In this kid's song,

15:04.300 --> 15:06.140
we can translate some of the lyrics as,

15:06.140 --> 15:14.080
Slap her on the bum, sit down on your pussy. The song was written by his father and his manager, Wellington Silver, and the girls in

15:14.080 --> 15:18.840
this video are alleged to be his 12-year-old cousin and her 19-year-old friend,

15:19.240 --> 15:25.140
Classy. And going back to these child stars, one of the biggest peddlers of this media was a YouTube channel under the name of

15:25.140 --> 15:32.920
Programma Panico. They seem to enjoy reporting on these artists, and what you'll see is Melody alongside many other prominent artists, all

15:33.520 --> 15:41.460
networking fairly closely. These connections seem to be rooted in one central man known as Emerson Martin, shown here, who clearly enjoys the

15:41.460 --> 15:43.460
company of children.

15:43.860 --> 15:49.820
Emerson, although it appears not the manager of Melody, seemed to be very involved with creating this specific culture.

15:49.820 --> 15:56.780
Even if he wasn't directly involved with everyone, his grasp reached out and promoted many of these people, who then went on to create

15:56.980 --> 15:59.480
music with fairly explicit undertones.

15:59.580 --> 16:05.640
Let's pull up a couple examples just to entertain you guys. In the song, Tava Naruwa, by MC

16:05.780 --> 16:12.200
Pikachu, the then 15-year-old is in the street smoking a joint when he is approached by a lady who would like a toke.

16:12.200 --> 16:19.480
However, MC Pikachu is a crafty man and demands that she in return gives him the pussy. He demands this quite explicitly.

16:27.480 --> 16:30.720
In another song, Rosa Rosa, by MC Brinquedo,

16:31.000 --> 16:39.160
one translation reads that he would like you to rub, rub, rub your turkey in her because she likes it. At the time of release, the

16:39.160 --> 16:40.600
lad was

16:40.600 --> 16:47.480
13, I could go on and on and on. The number of MCs are endless. MC Gee, MC Pet, MC

16:47.480 --> 16:50.700
Dukoventy, I could go on. Now, with all this considered,

16:50.700 --> 16:56.380
it's completely fair to say that this caused a lot of controversy and wasn't just swept under the rug. There was

16:56.680 --> 17:01.280
significant outrage from people, given that these artists weren't just making this sort of music,

17:01.280 --> 17:08.600
but many of them were performing in adult clubs, partaking in adult behavior, and this caused a lot of stir. Now, on one hand, you can

17:08.880 --> 17:16.460
legislate against adult clubs and such by putting an age limit on, but when it comes to explicit music, being able to legislate against such is

17:16.560 --> 17:18.600
incredibly difficult. In most societies,

17:18.600 --> 17:24.600
we rely on common decency to avoid these scenarios, and this just wasn't happening here. A culture that had been

17:24.960 --> 17:30.840
cultivated was enabling this, and if legislators didn't step in, it was only going to go downhill.

17:30.840 --> 17:37.400
There was a lot of audiences. These people had fan pages. They were making thousands by being extremely, extremely

17:38.200 --> 17:40.040
explicit in the way they expressed themselves.

17:40.040 --> 17:45.960
So, the Sao Paulo prosecution service opened an investigation to the way these children were behaving.

17:45.960 --> 17:49.860
So, where does Melody come into this? Well, according to many articles I read,

17:49.860 --> 17:53.740
it was a viral clip of her that launched the controversy. This one, to be exact.

17:57.280 --> 18:01.400
This caused a petition to be set up by many people that called on the services to

18:01.440 --> 18:07.360
investigate the parents, in this instance, the father, for exploiting her and causing her to form in such a way. In response to this,

18:07.400 --> 18:14.300
MCJellyJunk made a video where he defended the scenario, calling the people who attacked him bigots, and that they just want to shut down the

18:14.320 --> 18:20.560
industry that they've created. He basically tried to turn this into a cultural war where these people were attacking him because it was funk,

18:20.560 --> 18:22.840
rather than because it was child exploitation.

18:22.840 --> 18:27.760
I wanted to find this video in question, but I think it's been removed from the internet. What we do know,

18:27.760 --> 18:33.760
however, is when the real consequences set in, it appears he changed his tune and committed to changing the behavior,

18:33.760 --> 18:36.000
so she wasn't completely taken away from him.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.960
It was hard to exactly ascertain the outcome of the investigation undertaken by the authorities,

18:40.960 --> 18:46.200
but I found one article that reported that Papa had signed an adjustment of contract that would prevent the

18:46.640 --> 18:52.280
sexualization of his daughter. He made a load of comments about how he was going to change, and I even found this video,

18:52.280 --> 18:59.520
which apparently was an uploaded musical apology with her clutching onto a toy, symbolic of retaining that childhood.

19:03.760 --> 19:15.880
Basically going full T-Martin. The thing is, of course, although the laws change, it's the mentality that provides the challenge.

19:15.880 --> 19:21.640
Whether the audience was adult pedophiles or children who wanted younger idols, and found them in the gritty

19:22.120 --> 19:24.600
indulgence, the story never has an end.

19:24.600 --> 19:37.480
One thing that you will find is that audiences very rarely completely go away, even when a principle is legally enforced.

19:37.480 --> 19:40.680
It doesn't mean that those people just disappear. They never disappear.

19:40.680 --> 19:46.840
One of the greatest problems about this situation is that it deals with expression, which is an eternally blurred line.

19:46.840 --> 19:53.600
If I say to someone that a child shouldn't express himself sexually, I'm not merely saying that a child shouldn't dry hump a sofa,

19:53.600 --> 19:57.920
I'm talking about content that might also be implicative to sexual behavior.

19:57.920 --> 20:03.280
The problem is, although morally we might all have a clear idea where we stand, when it comes down to the line,

20:03.280 --> 20:09.600
we will be challenged in our minds, and the law is even murkier, and it is swamped in loopholes,

20:09.600 --> 20:18.120
and our good mate Bolinio here wasn't going to lose out on the greatest opportunity for monetary success, and fame that he has ever experienced.

20:18.120 --> 20:21.080
I mean, look at him. He is having the time of his life.

20:21.480 --> 20:29.480
We leave the previous chapter from a man whose career has prospered from the usage of his child, and yet is now facing down restrictions.

20:29.480 --> 20:37.240
However, the demand for her as a public icon was not going to disappear, so he just had to rebrand a little.

20:37.240 --> 20:42.760
One of the artists that constantly came up in reference when observing the evolution was the singer Anita.

20:42.760 --> 20:48.240
According to her father, Melody seems to idolize the singer Anita, and wants to be much like her,

20:48.240 --> 20:54.760
even to the point where she performed a lip sync version of the Anita song Bang, which is a decent banger to be fair,

20:54.760 --> 20:57.640
but I shall not be playing it because it's probably copyrighted.

20:57.640 --> 21:02.320
This was her new road, what her father branded as the non-sexual Anita.

21:02.320 --> 21:10.800
In spite of this, the video in question still received rather negative ratings, because although it may not be breaching any agreements regarding sexualization,

21:10.800 --> 21:13.360
its choreography can still be rather suggestive.

21:13.360 --> 21:17.200
This is one of the biggest issues, and this is something that will arise again very soon.

21:17.200 --> 21:24.400
What he's doing now is he's making Melody imitate singers that may be a bit sexually suggestive, and then labelling it under parody.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.520
And this is his idea of a loophole.

21:26.520 --> 21:29.560
At this point, you should realize that we've reached a conundrum.

21:29.560 --> 21:38.160
Sexualization sells, but it's also an absolutely morally bankrupt thing to do, and doing it makes you an absolutely abhorrent human being when it's your child.

21:38.160 --> 21:44.520
I mean, it's not a conundrum for us, but it was for Daddy here, and it was a conundrum because he had the authorities looking at him,

21:44.520 --> 21:50.920
and he knew if he mobilized enough people against him, then it might be buy-buy money, and buy-buy daughter too.

21:50.920 --> 21:54.040
But I think we all know which one was a priority to him.

21:54.040 --> 21:58.640
So with this in mind, Papa, and probably many other people who could make a quick buck,

21:58.640 --> 22:02.440
definitely took more precautions regarding how she was portrayed in the media.

22:02.440 --> 22:09.360
I mean, this one's a rather innocent song about childhood love, this one's a more mature song about relationships.

22:09.360 --> 22:15.240
Still a bit strange in how it's presented, and I find it hilarious how they couldn't even get a person with genuine acne,

22:15.240 --> 22:20.320
and they had to add makeup spots like she was Nanny McPhee, but we'll let that one slide.

22:20.320 --> 22:28.480
This time, I think what she did was still fairly questionable, but as observed in my previous videos, people become bored of attacking the same person,

22:28.480 --> 22:33.200
and I guess what she did wasn't bad enough to rile up any further legal action against the family,

22:33.240 --> 22:41.880
Though a pretty prominent declaration was the fact that she deleted her old videos, and released the statement that she would no longer be doing falsettos and quote parodies,

22:41.880 --> 22:48.240
which was the lip-sync content that I described. A load of news outlets jumped on this, so I guess it was important.

22:48.240 --> 22:54.160
I think the main reason she pulled the parodies, at least, was because she ended up with a copyright controversy with Rihanna,

22:54.160 --> 22:57.560
where she had the lip-sync version pulled from circulation.

22:57.560 --> 23:01.560
And looking back then, the comments on these videos, the consensus was very clear.

23:01.560 --> 23:07.520
People thought she was being taken advantage of by her father. This is not a new thing. People in Brazil knew this.

23:07.520 --> 23:13.560
She still ended up in controversy, such as her parody of the hands to myself, which once again, it was pretty terrible,

23:13.560 --> 23:20.880
but it was that loophole of sexualization through parody, and I guess the fact that she wasn't gyrating the club meant that it was alright.

23:20.880 --> 23:26.600
This is one of the dynamics that the internet has created, and this is why the online world is such a threat,

23:26.600 --> 23:30.120
because people don't look at it the same, and on one hand, that's correct.

23:30.120 --> 23:35.560
Me making a video for you guys to see is not the same as me performing this to a stadium.

23:35.560 --> 23:41.720
But at the same time, the impersonality and the detachment can make people feel disconnected from the content.

23:41.720 --> 23:48.280
If she'd done this live in front of hundreds of thousands of adult men, some of which with their hands pretty deep in their underwear,

23:48.280 --> 23:51.320
I'm sure, the authorities probably would have swooped in immediately.

23:56.600 --> 24:05.080
The problem is that MC Nelly Monk was probably quite aware of this, and pounced on the opportunity.

24:05.080 --> 24:13.160
This is where we introduce Instagram. It appears that Melody and her sister Bella signed up to Instagram barely months after the initial incident with her father,

24:13.160 --> 24:18.360
clearly with the intent of branching out the brand. With a lot of initial content being rather innocent,

24:18.360 --> 24:23.640
it was just her posting where she was, what she was doing, and all that jazz. Nothing too provocative.

24:23.640 --> 24:30.280
However, Instagram is a platform that I've never really dealt with on this channel, and that's really because I've never felt the impetus to.

24:30.280 --> 24:34.440
I don't have an account, you know, why would anyone want to hear about my miserable life?

24:34.440 --> 24:42.920
The thing is that a majority of the mega online sites take an extremely accelerated route not dissimilar to that of civilization.

24:42.920 --> 24:48.520
We begin by exploring the websites cautiously, pleasure, leisure, just uploading content,

24:48.520 --> 24:53.560
and then when enough people are browsing and enough algorithms exist, people try and work them out.

24:53.640 --> 25:00.200
And if you've got something like a share button or a like button, suddenly people begin to see how they can obtain influence,

25:00.200 --> 25:08.040
whether it's posting snide tweets, pretentious video essays, or in Instagram's case, a whole variety of stuff that I just find impossible to follow.

25:10.040 --> 25:17.080
What will be inevitable is the creation of some hierarchy around some general appeal that's held within a demographic,

25:17.080 --> 25:21.880
and once an appeal is worked out, people will try to one-up themselves in that industry.

25:21.880 --> 25:25.400
That's what we saw with what eventually escalated to be Lil Tay.

25:25.400 --> 25:31.880
You start with something that rides off its ridicule, such as the notion of a kid flexing with copious amounts of money,

25:31.880 --> 25:35.880
and then it spirals, and the subjects become younger and more audacious,

25:35.880 --> 25:41.560
and suddenly this person comes out and fulfills those prerequisites for attention.

25:41.560 --> 25:48.200
Now, that's just a general rundown, and as said, the Instagram situation is the main cause for the video today.

25:48.200 --> 25:51.800
But to give you a more experienced description of this specific situation,

25:51.800 --> 25:55.240
I've decided to bring in an expert on the Instagram industry,

25:55.240 --> 25:58.520
and, of course, an expert in bullying kids.

25:58.520 --> 26:00.920
My friend, James Moriot. Take it away.

26:02.360 --> 26:06.920
Hey, friends. I'm not James Moriot. I-I know. The resemblance is uncanny.

26:06.920 --> 26:11.160
My name's Pootsie, and I'm a sometimes editor for Tro, I make my own videos on my channel.

26:11.160 --> 26:12.120
Check them out, that'd be epic.

26:12.120 --> 26:17.000
See, James was meant to be here, but decided instead to go on a vacation with his YouTube millions.

26:17.240 --> 26:22.280
Hmm, I'm hungry. Maybe I should go to Cafe... Bean!

26:23.160 --> 26:25.240
Regardless, I'll be filling in for him.

26:25.240 --> 26:27.000
If you wanted to pursue a career in modeling,

26:27.000 --> 26:31.880
the case used to be that you'd go through a modeling agency and generally look pretty photogenic,

26:31.880 --> 26:34.520
or unfotogenic, depending on what they're going for.

26:34.520 --> 26:39.000
With the introduction of Instagram, any swamp creature can just rise from the depths of the platform,

26:39.000 --> 26:42.360
and with a little digital touching up of their photos, they can become a star.

26:42.360 --> 26:46.440
Now, when I say digital touching up, I'm referring to a specific type of photo editing.

26:46.440 --> 26:49.960
This is the type of photo editing that typically draws more attention to,

26:49.960 --> 26:53.480
shall we say, more sensitive parts of the body?

26:53.480 --> 26:56.680
It's thought editing, that's what it is. It's just thought editing.

26:56.680 --> 27:00.360
Instagram clearly has an expectation, but anybody can do this.

27:00.360 --> 27:04.840
And that's all fine and good until you realize who falls under the category of anybody.

27:04.840 --> 27:08.920
Even though the site claims that they won't allow anybody under the age of 13 to sign up,

27:08.920 --> 27:11.160
they won't really go out of their way to enforce it.

27:11.160 --> 27:16.360
It's also very easy to just claim someone else runs your account, or even easier, lie about your age.

27:16.360 --> 27:19.640
But one way or another, children and crowds arrived on the platform,

27:19.640 --> 27:22.440
looking up to their idols like Belle Delphine.

27:23.480 --> 27:26.360
You can see how the things they post could easily become sexualized.

27:26.360 --> 27:30.200
Here you have this site that promotes and rewards sexualization of content,

27:30.200 --> 27:33.960
and you have children coming in trying to follow suit and grow on this platform.

27:33.960 --> 27:37.640
That's when you see rise to people like Danielle Kahn and, of course, Melody.

27:37.640 --> 27:40.600
If you go to her Instagram now, you'll notice that a lot of the posts,

27:40.600 --> 27:43.320
or some of the posts, are rather innocent.

27:43.320 --> 27:47.400
That's because she or her management team deleted a lot of the more raunchy photos.

27:47.400 --> 27:49.960
But only very recently is a response to public outcry.

27:49.960 --> 27:51.160
Some of the pedophiles...

27:51.160 --> 27:51.800
Sorry, sorry.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.560
Melody's fans.

27:53.560 --> 27:54.760
Some of Melody's fans.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.560
I don't know how I got the word pedophile mixed up there.

27:57.560 --> 28:00.760
Some of Melody's fans noticed that the content changed up a little bit,

28:00.760 --> 28:02.520
and they're not having any of it.

28:02.520 --> 28:05.720
A lot of comments on these now deleted photos were very creepy.

28:05.720 --> 28:07.960
It was clear the type of people who were enjoying this content.

28:07.960 --> 28:11.400
But after the controversy, now it's kind of hard to find those sort of comments.

28:11.400 --> 28:14.120
Typically, now what you'll find is people condemning her father,

28:14.120 --> 28:16.280
and a surprising amount of people who are her age

28:16.280 --> 28:18.360
and just happen to look like they're in their mid-40s,

28:18.360 --> 28:20.120
leaving comments about how much they love her.

28:20.120 --> 28:21.000
Because that's normal.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.880
Now, there's nothing inherently terrible about these comments,

28:23.880 --> 28:25.880
but if you compare them to the type of comments that I,

28:25.880 --> 28:28.440
or literally anybody else, gets on a daily basis,

28:28.440 --> 28:31.960
you can see something a little bit fishy is going on here.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.640
Now, I don't want to be the one to say it,

28:33.640 --> 28:36.040
but I don't think Pablo's 12.

28:36.040 --> 28:36.280
He's...

28:37.160 --> 28:38.920
He's looking like he could have a mortgage.

28:38.920 --> 28:40.360
He just matured very quickly.

28:40.360 --> 28:45.240
The sexualization of Melody's Instagram got so bad that people she worked with,

28:45.240 --> 28:46.840
like Felipe Nito,

28:46.840 --> 28:49.240
literally deleted all of the videos with her in them,

28:49.240 --> 28:52.280
because he felt disgusted by how sexualized she was.

28:52.280 --> 28:55.320
He even contacted her father and told him this needs to stop,

28:55.320 --> 28:56.600
or I'm going to do this,

28:56.600 --> 28:57.560
and it didn't stop.

28:57.560 --> 28:59.320
And rightfully, he doesn't blame her for this.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.680
He blames Bolinho.

29:01.800 --> 29:02.840
Big Bolinho.

29:02.840 --> 29:08.440
While researching this, one comment that I've seen throughout YouTube, Instagram,

29:08.440 --> 29:11.640
some of her really raunchy TikToks that are still up,

29:11.640 --> 29:15.720
are comments from genuine children around her age that are questioning

29:15.720 --> 29:19.000
why they don't look as mature or act as mature as she does.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.680
See, children on these platforms,

29:20.680 --> 29:25.000
acting more mature than they are for attention and likes and whatever else,

29:25.000 --> 29:28.760
it perpetuates this cycle of other children coming onto these platforms,

29:28.760 --> 29:30.360
seeing how these children are acting,

29:30.360 --> 29:32.680
and questioning why they don't act that way themselves.

29:32.680 --> 29:35.080
It's encouraging kids to grow up faster than they should.

29:35.080 --> 29:38.440
There are studies directly related to this and how it affects a developing mind,

29:38.440 --> 29:40.840
and the results of which shouldn't be ignored.

29:40.840 --> 29:42.920
Even if you're able to ignore the fact that more adults

29:42.920 --> 29:46.520
are singing along to Melody's hit singles than actual kids her own age,

29:46.520 --> 29:47.880
I wonder why that is.

29:47.880 --> 29:50.200
Uncle Lester, please stop playing MC Melody.

29:50.200 --> 29:53.080
Children acting older than they are is not simply pet-obeyed,

29:53.080 --> 29:54.840
it's honestly an epidemic.

29:54.840 --> 29:56.280
These kids will develop differently,

29:56.280 --> 29:59.320
and I'm sure Melody's going to grow up to have horrible psychological problems,

29:59.320 --> 30:00.600
if she doesn't already.

30:00.600 --> 30:04.680
But on the bright side, at least MC Bolinho is making fat stacks off of her,

30:04.760 --> 30:09.080
so maybe one day you can pay for a good therapist or another chain.

30:09.080 --> 30:10.040
One or the other, really.

30:10.040 --> 30:12.200
If you're below the age of 18 and you're watching this,

30:12.840 --> 30:14.360
hold on to your innocence,

30:14.360 --> 30:15.720
hold on to your childhood,

30:15.720 --> 30:19.240
hold on to anything that makes you not this.

30:19.240 --> 30:21.000
Because as much as you might want to grow up now,

30:21.000 --> 30:23.400
childhood is a very important stage of life.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.320
But there is still more to be explored here,

30:25.320 --> 30:27.000
so I'll pass it back to Turo.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.600
James Moore, it f**ks kids.

30:28.600 --> 30:29.480
Thank you, James.

30:29.480 --> 30:32.200
Be sure to check out his channel in the pinned comment.

30:32.200 --> 30:34.200
And as James has really outlined,

30:34.200 --> 30:37.000
the reason the Instagram content became more sexual

30:37.000 --> 30:40.120
was the same reason why Melody was dropping all fours in the club.

30:40.120 --> 30:41.160
It was the market,

30:41.160 --> 30:44.280
and the father noticed that market and responded accordingly.

30:44.280 --> 30:45.400
And like the first time,

30:45.400 --> 30:47.880
he knows Melody is still in the public eye,

30:47.880 --> 30:50.920
and even if he can't use her one way, he'll find another.

30:50.920 --> 30:53.400
In this instance, no one cared until the outcry.

30:53.400 --> 30:55.640
Instagram benefit because it's a ton of traffic,

30:55.640 --> 30:59.240
and unless there's real outrage against the platform, who cares?

30:59.240 --> 31:03.160
MC Wellyjunk gets to release a few more tripe singles about how rich he is,

31:03.160 --> 31:04.760
and everyone's winning.

31:04.760 --> 31:05.480
Or are they?

31:13.240 --> 31:18.120
The thing is that exploitation for business purposes is all that the father knows,

31:18.120 --> 31:20.600
and he was just adapting to what he knew,

31:20.600 --> 31:23.800
and the Instagram platform opened up an international doorway,

31:23.800 --> 31:28.040
because your appeal doesn't solely rely on a Portuguese-speaking market.

31:28.040 --> 31:31.160
Which on one hand, it probably opened up a whole new form of income,

31:31.160 --> 31:32.280
many new opportunities,

31:32.280 --> 31:36.520
but at the same time, you're opening yourself up to a new tidal wave of outrage

31:36.520 --> 31:39.560
with people who are not familiar with your established infamy.

31:39.560 --> 31:43.320
Still, she has accumulated over 3 million followers, and she's 11.

31:43.320 --> 31:44.680
Just let that sink in.

31:44.680 --> 31:46.200
Instagram hasn't really done anything,

31:46.200 --> 31:49.800
and she may not be prone to online predators on that platform,

31:49.800 --> 31:53.080
but you know there are a lot of seedy individuals viewing the content,

31:53.080 --> 31:56.200
and at the end of the day, to an extent, that is beyond our control.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.360
But at the same time, she's a child,

31:58.360 --> 32:02.520
and the father is morally dubious in acknowledging these consequences,

32:02.520 --> 32:05.000
because I refuse to believe he's not aware,

32:05.000 --> 32:06.840
and I will call him out for that.

32:06.840 --> 32:11.080
One of the many problems is that we have just become so desensitized to a lot of these things,

32:11.080 --> 32:14.680
it means they pass under the radar even when they're right in front of our eyes,

32:14.680 --> 32:19.080
mainly because the online detachment doesn't make us realise the real implications,

32:19.080 --> 32:21.800
particularly when it becomes expected of the culture,

32:21.800 --> 32:24.760
and what happens suddenly doesn't become as much of a reach.

32:24.760 --> 32:27.800
Clickbait thumbnails and exaggerated narratives are a norm,

32:27.800 --> 32:30.200
and so we no longer pay close attention to them,

32:30.200 --> 32:33.720
they almost become a punchline rather than an actual concern.

32:33.720 --> 32:38.280
On top of this, the thing about Melody is that it was all rooted in that funk culture.

32:38.280 --> 32:41.720
From when she was 8, she had that audience who knew her,

32:41.720 --> 32:43.480
and knew what they wanted from her,

32:43.480 --> 32:47.640
and all this Instagram incident is, is a shifting of that delivery.

32:47.640 --> 32:49.800
It is the same expectations.

32:49.800 --> 32:53.640
All of this history is important to note, as it should document a trend.

32:53.640 --> 32:57.160
The father was deeply invested in this, whether it's for the money or the fame,

32:57.160 --> 33:00.120
or whether he wants to release more intolerable tracks.

33:00.120 --> 33:02.600
It doesn't matter, looking at the situation today,

33:02.600 --> 33:06.600
I would not be taking any chances, and neither was anyone else by the looks of it.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.120
Under pressure from those around him,

33:08.120 --> 33:11.000
following a couple interviews where the mother voiced her concerns,

33:11.000 --> 33:14.440
the father wrote a letter apologising for the mother's absence from their life,

33:14.440 --> 33:18.360
and stated that he was working with the authorities to hand over custody to her.

33:18.360 --> 33:20.680
What will happen following this is hard to say exactly,

33:20.680 --> 33:23.000
but it might be a step in the right direction.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.560
On top of this, there are so many cultural problems that can be outlined by observing this situation,

33:27.560 --> 33:31.400
many of which yield from the society that Melody has experienced herself.

33:31.400 --> 33:34.920
One of the constant defences that I found when dealing with these situations,

33:34.920 --> 33:38.040
whether it was from that twat Emerson Martins, or the father,

33:38.040 --> 33:41.960
or anyone else defending the actions, is that it's part of the culture,

33:41.960 --> 33:44.680
and these people are just representing that culture,

33:44.680 --> 33:46.760
and the experiences that come along with it.

33:46.760 --> 33:51.560
Those who are trying to shut them down are the oppressors, breaking apart that defiance.

33:51.560 --> 33:56.360
They are the underdogs, punching up with their 8-year-old exploitation.

33:56.360 --> 34:01.320
This has been an argument ever-present, with a lot of discussion related to hip-hop.

34:01.320 --> 34:07.880
Whether it's rap or funk, its whole demeanour is representing experiences that are not pleasant,

34:07.880 --> 34:09.560
and that is part of a culture.

34:09.560 --> 34:13.160
Plenty of rappers do that, and that is fine,

34:13.160 --> 34:18.120
but at the same time, it's important to know where to draw the line when it comes to these topics,

34:18.120 --> 34:21.880
and it's important that the cultural argument doesn't become a scapegoat

34:21.880 --> 34:24.360
to conduct fairly heinous actions.

34:24.360 --> 34:27.080
Just because Pusha T has sold some drugs in his time,

34:27.080 --> 34:31.000
doesn't mean that 6ix9ine gets a free pass to underage intercourse.

34:31.000 --> 34:36.120
And if funk is representing experiences of children sexualizing and adultifying themselves,

34:36.120 --> 34:41.720
whether MC Toy or Melody, or many more on the list that have made this twisted hierarchy,

34:41.720 --> 34:45.640
then they may want to look at themselves and look at the experiences they create.

34:45.640 --> 34:50.360
On one hand, the fact that it might be culturally represented does not shift agency,

34:50.360 --> 34:53.480
because this in itself is a relatively recent situation,

34:53.480 --> 34:58.760
and many of the people participating in this clearly had the free will to decipher that it was wrong,

34:58.760 --> 35:03.400
and they were exposed to the sober criticism of others, and they ignored it.

35:03.400 --> 35:07.320
The content was not merely representative, it was indulgent,

35:07.320 --> 35:12.760
and it was glorifying a concept deeply broken, and marketing it to other vulnerable children.

35:12.760 --> 35:17.800
There's a vast difference in talking about these experiences and shining a light on them,

35:17.800 --> 35:21.560
rather than implicitly encouraging others to go out and do it themselves,

35:21.560 --> 35:25.720
and marketing it to other vulnerable children and questionable adults,

35:25.720 --> 35:27.960
and suggesting that this should be the dream.

35:27.960 --> 35:33.480
I mean, Emerson Martins called his mansion the dreams factory, whatever that's meant to mean.

35:33.480 --> 35:36.280
That is a dangerous narrative to create.

35:36.280 --> 35:41.160
However, on the other hand, the fact that many people clearly see this as a route out of such

35:41.160 --> 35:45.800
a deprived, hopeless lifestyle may be a message to society to wake up,

35:45.800 --> 35:49.320
and although condemning this specific incident is the right thing to do,

35:49.320 --> 35:53.800
I know that I do not know the exact details of the situation,

35:53.800 --> 35:57.800
and people who are close to the situation have to look at this and ask themselves,

35:57.800 --> 36:00.600
what drives a culture like that to arise?

36:00.600 --> 36:03.240
What drives people to affirm that lifestyle?

36:03.240 --> 36:07.400
Why is there a demand for it, and why has this network been created?

36:07.400 --> 36:10.920
The situation in Brazil can be pretty dire, depending on where you are,

36:10.920 --> 36:13.400
and although absolute poverty has been decreasing,

36:13.400 --> 36:15.880
income inequality is still extremely high,

36:15.880 --> 36:20.840
and it will breed a mentality where that successful lifestyle is glorifying,

36:20.840 --> 36:23.160
particularly when it's enabled by an audience,

36:23.160 --> 36:27.880
or has prominent figures that it will drive to obtain at all costs,

36:27.880 --> 36:31.160
even if that means sacrificing your children's dignity.

36:31.160 --> 36:34.600
I don't want to deny anyone a chance to escape poverty,

36:34.600 --> 36:36.920
but the means have to justify the ends,

36:36.920 --> 36:38.760
and I feel this is the wrong way,

36:38.760 --> 36:40.680
but when showing something is wrong,

36:40.680 --> 36:43.240
it's not just a case of showing people why it's wrong,

36:43.240 --> 36:46.840
but it's also a question of showing people a better path forward.

36:46.840 --> 36:49.240
I can't specify what path that might be,

36:49.240 --> 36:52.600
because that is a dive into politics so deep,

36:52.600 --> 36:57.800
that it would probably require more than just a twat Saturday microphone to uncover.

36:57.800 --> 37:02.280
On top of this, it should be time for sites like Instagram to see some initiative.

37:02.280 --> 37:04.040
According to the terms and conditions,

37:04.040 --> 37:07.080
the sign-up age is 13, and Melody is not 13,

37:07.080 --> 37:10.360
and although her dad's probably the owner of the account to loophole this,

37:10.360 --> 37:12.920
and we shouldn't just ban pictures of children from existing,

37:12.920 --> 37:17.000
there is clear contextual detail that should make this situation rather simple,

37:17.000 --> 37:20.760
and once again, without real action, there will be no real lessons learned.

37:20.760 --> 37:23.400
The father constantly sought the success of his peers

37:23.400 --> 37:27.240
by emulating the lowest tropes of that genre,

37:27.240 --> 37:29.480
and as we live in a more interconnected world,

37:29.480 --> 37:32.520
that aim doesn't change just the techniques,

37:32.520 --> 37:33.560
and that's the point.

37:33.560 --> 37:36.920
Melody's more suggestive content was a general appeal

37:36.920 --> 37:40.680
to very seedy figures dressed up in a notion of cultural defiance,

37:40.680 --> 37:44.040
and every genre like that walks the line all over the world,

37:44.040 --> 37:48.440
and the genres that influence the Brazilian ones that we witness today did the same,

37:48.440 --> 37:51.000
but people should call it out the same.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.240
You cannot remove that agency,

37:53.240 --> 37:56.680
because from the get-go, it's clear that MC Belligno,

37:56.680 --> 38:00.200
aka Tiago Abreu, had no discernible talent,

38:00.200 --> 38:04.040
and although the daughters weren't anything special either, I would say,

38:04.040 --> 38:07.320
they had something that he could compromise on to make them famous,

38:07.320 --> 38:08.600
and that was their youth,

38:08.600 --> 38:11.960
and that's where many other people with dignity would draw the line,

38:11.960 --> 38:13.720
and it's clear that over the last few years,

38:13.720 --> 38:17.000
in spite of the constant controversies facing down the daughters,

38:17.000 --> 38:20.760
he has been unfazed and only sought to maintain that image,

38:20.760 --> 38:23.880
while trying to sidestep authorities at every moment

38:23.880 --> 38:25.720
by tweaking a few of the details,

38:25.720 --> 38:28.360
whether it was parodies, whether it was Instagram,

38:28.360 --> 38:29.960
whether it was anything else,

38:29.960 --> 38:33.400
and many Brazilians have been aware of this for ages,

38:33.400 --> 38:35.320
and although this is only news to us now,

38:35.320 --> 38:36.600
with the change in custody,

38:36.600 --> 38:39.400
I hope it will also be a turning point for her life,

38:39.400 --> 38:42.120
and it's important for people to carry on keeping an eye on her,

38:42.120 --> 38:43.960
and now there's a more global perspective,

38:43.960 --> 38:45.960
on top of the presence from Felipe Neto,

38:45.960 --> 38:48.120
which has also provided positive influence,

38:48.120 --> 38:50.520
not just with the family from the psychological support,

38:50.520 --> 38:54.520
but on social media such as having her content removed from rather seedy sites,

38:54.520 --> 38:57.640
and this has given me a hope that there might be a light at the end of the tunnel

38:57.640 --> 39:00.120
for Gabriela Severino Abreu.

39:02.200 --> 39:05.720
Before we end, I want to say that this video was sponsored by ExpressVPN.

39:05.720 --> 39:08.840
Now, honestly, I've never really been interested in VPNs,

39:08.840 --> 39:12.360
but now I'm a personality with loads of people hitting me up and looking for me,

39:12.360 --> 39:14.360
and also a lot to research.

39:14.360 --> 39:17.000
It's kinda a necessity that I do have something like this,

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
that can shield me from hackers and snoopers,

39:19.000 --> 39:22.520
but also give me access to sites that I might not have access to otherwise.

39:22.520 --> 39:26.360
So in a way, I'm glad ExpressVPN hit me up and offered me a good old sponsorship,

39:26.360 --> 39:28.600
because I am a cheap bastard.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.280
Being the critical man that I am,

39:30.280 --> 39:33.080
and obviously given the narratives I've spoken about in the past,

39:33.080 --> 39:34.680
especially regarding better help,

39:34.680 --> 39:37.480
I wanted to use their services first, and they let me.

39:37.480 --> 39:40.840
I've been pretty happy, and it does make me feel more secure.

39:40.840 --> 39:43.160
It helps me traverse problems such as the restriction

39:43.160 --> 39:45.480
that the EU places on certain news sites,

39:45.480 --> 39:47.880
I'm someone who will regularly need to consume media

39:47.880 --> 39:50.200
from obscure American media outlets,

39:50.200 --> 39:52.920
and ExpressVPN can enable me to do that.

39:52.920 --> 39:56.280
If I want to watch my sad old man political shows in the UK,

39:56.280 --> 39:59.560
but the BBC won't recognise my citizenship due to my location,

39:59.560 --> 40:02.360
then I can do that, with Article 13 coming in.

40:02.360 --> 40:04.520
I mean, I don't know how much I'm gonna need it,

40:04.520 --> 40:05.960
but I'm grateful that it's there.

40:05.960 --> 40:08.760
I really enjoy the service, its interface is simple,

40:08.760 --> 40:11.480
I haven't experienced any real lag while using it,

40:11.480 --> 40:14.600
it's to the point, nice little cheeky design,

40:14.600 --> 40:18.360
quick to connect, has locations in around 90 countries,

40:18.360 --> 40:20.200
not that you'd need that many, but it's there,

40:20.200 --> 40:22.280
and they keep your content completely private,

40:22.280 --> 40:24.280
with no real restrictions on what you can do,

40:24.280 --> 40:26.040
and my experience isn't the only one,

40:26.040 --> 40:27.960
they are pretty revered all round.

40:27.960 --> 40:29.960
I haven't had any problems, but if you do,

40:29.960 --> 40:32.280
they have customer support, which is pretty neat.

40:32.280 --> 40:36.040
I did test it out, I sent a message at 1.39am my time,

40:36.040 --> 40:37.880
and they responded in the space of a minute,

40:37.880 --> 40:40.840
so they're clearly receptive, and I think it was a human.

40:40.840 --> 40:43.320
These robots are getting smarter though, mind you.

40:43.320 --> 40:45.480
Even on simple things like filling in a form,

40:45.480 --> 40:47.720
I've found sometimes they can grab my IP,

40:47.720 --> 40:49.480
and although it may not seem malicious,

40:49.480 --> 40:51.480
it's nice to have that extra veil of privacy,

40:51.560 --> 40:53.480
and that's something that anyone can encounter,

40:53.480 --> 40:56.360
so really, I can see it having a purpose for everyone,

40:56.360 --> 40:57.320
to an extent.

40:57.320 --> 41:00.840
As an app, it's pretty much usable on every device,

41:00.840 --> 41:05.080
Windows, iOS, Android, Macs, Linux,

41:05.080 --> 41:06.440
router, and more,

41:06.440 --> 41:08.120
I mean, I don't really know how many more there are,

41:08.120 --> 41:09.800
but you know, there probably is more.

41:09.800 --> 41:12.120
There are also browser extensions,

41:12.120 --> 41:14.360
you can get Chrome and Firefox,

41:14.360 --> 41:15.640
not Safari though,

41:15.640 --> 41:19.000
because people who use Safari like pineapple on pizza,

41:19.080 --> 41:21.960
and I made sure we didn't let them in on this,

41:21.960 --> 41:23.880
but even if you do have Safari,

41:23.880 --> 41:26.120
you'll obviously be able to get it on Mac regardless,

41:26.120 --> 41:28.840
it's just the browser extensions they don't have on Safari.

41:28.840 --> 41:30.760
Overall, I haven't had any problems,

41:30.760 --> 41:32.280
and if you are looking for a VPN,

41:32.280 --> 41:33.800
I would recommend it.

41:33.800 --> 41:36.120
Normally, prices are $7 a month,

41:36.120 --> 41:37.160
but if you're not happy,

41:37.160 --> 41:39.320
there is a 30-day money-back guarantee,

41:39.320 --> 41:42.520
and if you use my very spicy code by going on the URL,

41:42.520 --> 41:45.320
expressvpn.com slash tro,

41:45.320 --> 41:46.920
that's slash t-r-o,

41:46.920 --> 41:47.960
as in my initials,

41:47.960 --> 41:51.000
you can get the first three months off a one-year package,

41:51.000 --> 41:52.920
and the links will be in the description

41:52.920 --> 41:55.640
to make it nice and accessible for all you delightful people.

41:55.640 --> 41:56.920
That's all I've got to say about that.

41:56.920 --> 41:57.480
Once again,

41:58.520 --> 42:02.840
good on the lads at ExpressVPN for helping me in my time of need.

42:02.840 --> 42:04.280
Definitely recommend.

42:04.280 --> 42:05.320
If you're looking for something like that,

42:05.320 --> 42:07.640
if you feel like it's going to be something that might benefit you,

42:07.640 --> 42:09.800
then yeah, I'd recommend ExpressVPN.

42:09.800 --> 42:11.320
Anyhow, if you made it to the end of the video,

42:11.320 --> 42:12.440
big thanks,

42:12.440 --> 42:13.560
mega shout out to James,

42:14.840 --> 42:15.720
thank you for appearing,

42:15.800 --> 42:18.920
I'm gonna leave his link in the pinned comment,

42:18.920 --> 42:20.600
and I want you to go and send him some love.

42:20.600 --> 42:23.240
I also want you guys to go and send the editors some love,

42:23.240 --> 42:27.080
they have done a fantastic, stellar job as always,

42:27.080 --> 42:29.480
and it wouldn't be the same without them.

42:29.480 --> 42:32.360
On top of this, I want to thank my Patreons,

42:32.360 --> 42:34.280
special thanks to Connor,

42:34.280 --> 42:36.680
I also want to shout out some hullabaloo,

42:36.680 --> 42:38.600
and a special thanks to Ryan,

42:38.600 --> 42:40.360
and also a shout out to Brandon,

42:40.360 --> 42:44.360
my $50 and $100 Patreons consecutively,

42:44.360 --> 42:45.800
both fantastic,

42:45.800 --> 42:49.160
I'm very honoured, very flattered indeed,

42:49.160 --> 42:52.600
and you can't really top that sort of dedication,

42:52.600 --> 42:54.520
so respect it a lot.

42:54.520 --> 42:56.280
Anyhow, I don't have too much else to say,

42:56.280 --> 42:57.800
so I'll just see you around guys,

42:57.800 --> 42:59.880
have a fantastic day,

42:59.880 --> 43:01.080
I'm The Right Opinion,

43:01.080 --> 43:03.000
and I'll see you in the next one.

43:14.360 --> 43:16.360
I'll see you in the next one.
