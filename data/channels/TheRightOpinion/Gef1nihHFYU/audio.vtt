00:00.000 --> 00:09.920
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the right opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

00:09.920 --> 00:15.480
and TV shows, honestly something that I have an interest in, but seldom get around to actually watching.

00:15.480 --> 00:20.640
My biggest problem is how much time they tend to consume, and although I promise you I have too much free time,

00:20.640 --> 00:26.400
TM, it's not that I typically decide to dedicate all towards one TV show, I like to allocate it across various

00:26.400 --> 00:32.360
activities to maintain some mental wellbeing, because after all, in this world called YouTube, we can all use that

00:32.360 --> 00:38.320
from time to time. I mostly indulge my time in films, which are typically shorter in total, with exceptions,

00:38.320 --> 00:44.960
and gaming, because as I have always asserted, I am a gamer. Nonetheless, recently I have found myself in an

00:44.960 --> 00:50.400
interesting predicament because YouTube's slow monetization process has basically delayed so many of my videos

00:50.400 --> 00:55.200
that I found myself with a weak on my hands, and a desire to cover something slightly different.

00:55.440 --> 01:01.200
So without further ado, I suggest we tackle that slightly different subject on this glorious, glorious day,

01:01.200 --> 01:06.400
and if you have some basic reading capabilities, you will know that this is 13 Reasons Why.

01:06.400 --> 01:13.600
13 Reasons Why is a TV show that currently spans three seasons, although a fourth is expected too, so hooray for that.

01:13.600 --> 01:20.160
It is based on the young adult novel by Jay Asher, and the first series was released originally in 2017,

01:20.160 --> 01:26.720
to a furor of applause and acclaim from critics and audiences alike. However, it is not without its controversy.

01:26.720 --> 01:33.440
What is the basis of this controversy? Well, 13 Reasons Why is a show that, like many films and TV series,

01:33.440 --> 01:38.720
tackles tough issues. However, one of the central characters and narrators of this show, someone by the name of

01:38.720 --> 01:44.160
Hannah Baker, is resenting their narrative from the perspective of a deceased individual, but on top of that,

01:44.160 --> 01:50.000
she committed suicide, and left behind 13 tapes. These 13 tapes were each addressed to an individual

01:50.000 --> 01:55.280
who she felt had played a role in the situation that finally resulted in her death. These tapes would then

01:55.280 --> 02:00.720
circulate through each subject, being passed on until they completed their cycle. It is a show that asks

02:00.720 --> 02:06.480
questions regarding accountability, school environments, but it's also very graphic and intense, and not for the

02:06.480 --> 02:12.000
faint of heart. When covering any sensitive topic in a dramatized fashion, there will almost always be

02:12.000 --> 02:17.440
controversy, because many people have many different feelings on how to deal with these topics, and many

02:17.440 --> 02:22.320
people will have strong feelings on them, and therefore, even the occasional misstep will be viciously

02:22.320 --> 02:27.360
scrutinized, because if these things aren't done with the utmost delicacy, it could also lead to dangerous

02:27.360 --> 02:33.200
social outcomes. The first season of 13 Reasons Why was promoted under the guise of mental health discourse.

02:33.200 --> 02:38.160
In fact, if you watch the version now, you might see a disclaimer from one of the cast members stating that

02:38.160 --> 02:44.720
the intention of the series is to start a discussion, it was a significant marketing point. Therefore, at first

02:44.720 --> 02:50.640
when it came out, I kind of theorized that its messages probably bordered on inflammatory at points, but didn't do

02:50.640 --> 02:56.000
anything too egregious, because overall, it has still been well received. However, by the time the second season

02:56.000 --> 03:01.440
came, I began to well have second thoughts. The first season had been based on the book, as mentioned, however,

03:01.440 --> 03:06.880
the second season completely deviated from that, and I felt that move veered more on the side of exploitive,

03:06.880 --> 03:12.160
especially given how the original series was promoted. I assume maybe there was just a heavy demand, maybe it

03:12.160 --> 03:16.800
made a significant difference to some people's lives, but regardless, given the moderate success of the first

03:16.800 --> 03:22.880
season, I understood why it existed. Nonetheless, this season was not well received by critics, and audiences

03:22.880 --> 03:28.000
didn't seem to be particularly ecstatic either, although it is difficult to tell how the committed fans reacted.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.960
I assumed this would be the end, however, I was rather irritated when I heard that there would be, in fact,

03:32.960 --> 03:38.800
a third season, a move that I found frankly rather insulting, but ho-hum, maybe it would be better.

03:40.960 --> 03:45.600
Okay, never mind then, I figured at this point, a majority of the audience must have been but the most

03:45.600 --> 03:50.560
dedicated viewers of this show, who clearly felt that the messages mixed with the high school environment

03:50.560 --> 03:55.520
resonated with them. I really didn't see much additional value being drawn from it, and I also developed

03:55.520 --> 04:00.080
a sentiment of concern, because if they're still trying to send these social messages about all of these

04:00.080 --> 04:05.200
topics yet receiving such a significant amount of criticism, they can't be doing a particularly good job.

04:05.200 --> 04:10.160
My concern here was that, ultimately, 13 Reasons Why had an audience who supported them on the basis of

04:10.160 --> 04:14.400
their takes on these sensitive issues, yet their artistic failure to carry through these messages

04:14.400 --> 04:18.800
could well have negative social ramifications, particularly if the intended audience were more

04:18.800 --> 04:23.360
vulnerable individuals. Now, I did not guarantee to find exactly this, but I also know that there has

04:23.360 --> 04:28.400
been a lot of debate over it, and I hope to at least provide my own stance on it, with a caveat of caution

04:28.400 --> 04:33.760
and nuance to those interested in watching the series. There's an inconvenient truth, sometimes what

04:33.760 --> 04:38.640
might be most critically acclaimed or artistically bold or emotionally gripping may not be the best

04:38.640 --> 04:42.480
for an individual's health, and that's something that comes particularly to a head with a show like

04:42.480 --> 04:47.600
13 Reasons Why, and for a show that attempts to tread both borders with some amount of sensitivity,

04:47.600 --> 04:52.720
I'd say it's ultimately a fundamental failure, and with the fourth season on the horizon, it should

04:52.720 --> 04:57.600
probably take a moment for some self-reflection in its messages. The accrue behind 13 Reasons Why

04:57.600 --> 05:01.520
has made it clear that their intended audience has been those who are mentally vulnerable,

05:01.520 --> 05:06.320
and therefore that is something that cannot be discounted. I'm aware that my voice will

05:06.320 --> 05:10.320
ultimately have very little effect, and the show will continue to steamroll its way into Brian

05:10.320 --> 05:14.640
Yorkie's bank account, but if this video makes anyone take another look at the show, then I consider

05:14.640 --> 05:19.040
that a victory. I'm going to be outlining the plot of each season, before diving into my own personal

05:19.040 --> 05:22.960
thoughts and feelings regarding how the show tackles these issues, and the success slash

05:22.960 --> 05:27.680
shortcomings of this coverage, so without further ado, I suggest we get into it. I will

05:27.680 --> 05:31.920
preface this by saying that there will be spoilers. Let's go.

05:34.640 --> 05:39.120
Now I briefly mentioned the premise of season 1 while introducing this video, but I shall go into

05:39.120 --> 05:43.440
a bit more depth. There are two narratives that we have to observe, the first one being

05:43.440 --> 05:47.760
Hannah Baker, the deceased individual whose narrative is presented post-mortem on these

05:47.760 --> 05:52.720
13 tapes, and mostly follows her account through the state of flashbacks, and the second being the

05:52.720 --> 05:57.360
recipient of these tapes, Clay Jensen, whose narrative is mostly followed through present day.

05:57.360 --> 06:02.240
There is an episode dedicated to each tape, we follow Clay as he listens to them, and sometimes

06:02.240 --> 06:06.560
struggles to listen to them, interspersed with relevant flashbacks which run adjacent to Hannah

06:06.560 --> 06:10.960
Baker's narrative. We also follow Clay's own reaction to this, which may lead to certain

06:10.960 --> 06:16.240
behaviour when certain truths are revealed. There are many various arcs, as would be expected

06:16.240 --> 06:21.200
on a TV show, but the tapes are directed at individuals whom Hannah feels contributed to

06:21.200 --> 06:25.600
her suicide, sometimes through merely being complicit in a culture, or just being a straight

06:25.600 --> 06:30.240
out rapist. Hannah's parents are planning to sue the school for their inaction, and other students

06:30.240 --> 06:34.400
who are the subjects of these tapes are trying to prevent the release of these tapes. Another

06:34.400 --> 06:39.360
student, Tony Padilla, keeps an eye to make sure each person listens to these tapes. There are many

06:39.360 --> 06:44.720
other minor conflicts and tensions, but I shan't focus too much on them. Now, realism is a really

06:44.720 --> 06:49.600
important point when staying committed to recreating these environments. Not every film or

06:49.600 --> 06:55.280
TV show has to abide by basic fundamental laws that we may expect from the real world, in fact,

06:55.280 --> 07:00.400
many don't, even the ones that may seem grounded in principle. But 13 Reasons Why has a few more

07:00.400 --> 07:05.280
rules to abide by because they seek to portray the human condition, and environments that market

07:05.280 --> 07:10.400
relatability to their audiences. Therefore, certain elements of logic and realism have to be followed

07:10.400 --> 07:15.440
by in these instances. So realism will be discussed here, not just from a social perspective, but from

07:15.440 --> 07:20.240
an artistic perspective as well. I want to first focus on the premise, the fact that Hannah is

07:20.240 --> 07:24.800
recording the series of tapes, and directing them at specific individuals following her death.

07:24.800 --> 07:29.360
This has probably been one of the major sources of the controversy, being called out by many as

07:29.360 --> 07:34.080
unhealthily indulging in revenge fantasy. Now, this is where we should talk about the portrayal

07:34.080 --> 07:38.160
of Hannah Baker herself. She isn't the sole focal point of the narrative, and therefore,

07:38.160 --> 07:43.440
the writers have a bit more leeway to not present her as this all positive protagonist. Therefore,

07:43.440 --> 07:48.160
I didn't immediately object to her having less than amiable intentions regarding the creation of

07:48.160 --> 07:52.480
these tapes, because ultimately, it is the framing of the character that would define how she is

07:52.480 --> 07:57.440
presented to the audience. People don't always do the best thing, it's just important that there's

07:57.440 --> 07:59.440
some awareness of that.

08:01.840 --> 08:05.680
Hannah Baker- See, I can guarantee that one of the reasons that you're still listening

08:06.320 --> 08:13.120
is that you really want to know, who are the others? Who else is responsible for my death?

08:13.680 --> 08:19.520
Unfortunately, 13 Reasons Why doesn't really have that. For me, I received the impression that Clay's

08:19.520 --> 08:24.080
present day reaction was meant to be the core narrative that we were meant to emotionally follow,

08:24.080 --> 08:26.560
with certain deviations when he lashed out a little.

08:27.760 --> 08:29.760
Clay- Then she's not helping.

08:30.720 --> 08:31.840
Clay- I don't wanna help.

08:31.840 --> 08:36.960
And even those behaviours seem to fall on Clay, rather than Hannah. Ultimately, their handling was

08:36.960 --> 08:42.320
a failed opportunity to look into the dangers of creating a series of tapes. Accountability

08:42.320 --> 08:47.200
doesn't dissipate after you die, and although the tragedy should never be undermined at the

08:47.200 --> 08:51.680
same time, we shouldn't be afraid to analyse the morality of the actions themselves that

08:51.680 --> 08:55.920
come before. If the writing of other characters wasn't so on the nose, then their nuance may

08:55.920 --> 08:59.760
have been able to come through, because there are characters who dispute the release of these tapes,

08:59.760 --> 09:03.920
and even the details. For example, Jessica Davis, the subject of the second tape,

09:03.920 --> 09:06.960
tells Clay that Hannah was lying about certain details.

09:06.960 --> 09:12.080
Jessica- What she said? On the tapes? About us and Monet's? She's the one who stopped coming,

09:12.080 --> 09:16.880
not me. She's the one who ended our friendship, and she knew it. She's a liar.

09:18.720 --> 09:19.520
It wasn't a liar.

09:20.160 --> 09:25.120
However, by the end of the same episode, they use blatant dialogue to tell the audience that

09:25.120 --> 09:30.240
she clearly wasn't lying. Jessica- If Hannah was lying, why are you here?

09:30.240 --> 09:34.320
It was such an underplayed conflict that it basically had no reason to exist,

09:34.320 --> 09:38.800
and it was a missed opportunity to look into the implications of such tapes. When someone

09:38.800 --> 09:43.920
takes their own life, they are more often a victim of some circumstance. However, at the same time,

09:43.920 --> 09:48.000
content published with knowledge of their impending death may be questionable in its

09:48.000 --> 09:53.600
information, for two reasons. Firstly, a deceased individual won't have to face down the consequences

09:53.600 --> 09:58.720
of those narratives, and secondly, as they are a perceived victim, it will yield their post-mortem

09:58.720 --> 10:03.440
content more power, which is exactly what is demonstrated in season two, but we'll get to

10:03.440 --> 10:08.400
that eventually. However, even with that said, it is revealed later on the tapes that she did

10:08.400 --> 10:13.120
get a detail wrong, regarding another tape directed at Zack, a high school student who

10:13.120 --> 10:17.120
basically stole compliments from Hannah's compliment bag after she embarrassed him

10:17.120 --> 10:20.320
publicly. In the tapes, she says he threw a compliment away.

10:20.320 --> 10:24.480
Jessica- I was hoping once you read the letter, you'd get it. You'd realize how much I needed

10:24.480 --> 10:26.320
those silly things you were stealing from me.

10:30.560 --> 10:32.560
I guess I wasn't even worth the reaction.

10:33.600 --> 10:38.240
And yet, it's revealed he actually kept it. However, this habit of getting details wrong

10:38.240 --> 10:41.760
doesn't appear again, so I'm not really sure what we're meant to do with it.

10:41.760 --> 10:45.920
The only basis that it would have changed under is if we were still unsure about the validity of

10:45.920 --> 10:51.280
the tapes, but the subjects of the tapes act in such a purposefully self-incriminating way that

10:51.280 --> 11:03.360
it's not a point of contention, so ultimately, it just becomes this loose end, and we're left

11:03.360 --> 11:07.840
wondering if we should be lending the emotional value to the tapes that the writers clearly want

11:07.840 --> 11:12.960
us to. It's hard to tell if revenge is the direct motivation, however, it does appear at multiple

11:12.960 --> 11:17.280
points throughout the series. Probably the worst example of this is in episode four, a tape

11:17.280 --> 11:22.240
dedicated to an individual named Tyler, a creep who took photos of her at her home, and evaded

11:22.240 --> 11:26.640
her privacy, finally escalating when he took and shared a picture of her kissing another girl

11:26.640 --> 11:52.400
named Courtney. In her tape, she says this. This is followed by Clay, the present-day protagonist,

11:52.400 --> 11:57.040
taking a picture of Tyler's bare buttocks and sending it to the whole school. Now this was a bad

11:57.040 --> 12:01.360
idea for many reasons, and some characters even observe this, but there's little resolution or

12:01.360 --> 12:07.040
focus that says how bad an idea this was, and it was a really bad idea. Let's go into that.

12:09.600 --> 12:15.120
Bad ideas, they're common in this show, sometimes that's okay when they're framed as bad ideas,

12:15.120 --> 12:20.000
but often you end up with this sort of ass pic scene, no real closure because the tapes have

12:20.000 --> 12:24.800
moved on to their next subjects, and this leads to some real incoherence on actual morals.

12:25.360 --> 12:29.760
Scenes like those are made to stick out, made to shock, and therefore they stick in your head,

12:29.760 --> 12:34.320
and when I reflect on them, I don't really think they had any resolve or any conclusion that was

12:34.320 --> 12:39.200
meant to be presented to the audience. By the end of episode seven, and thus tape seven, Hannah Baker

12:39.200 --> 12:43.760
says this. Hannah Baker- No one knows what's really going on in another person's life,

12:44.720 --> 12:48.560
and you never know how what you do will affect someone else.

12:48.560 --> 12:53.280
Which is 100% true, but it's also a factor that has been neglected multiple times throughout

12:53.280 --> 12:58.080
the series. This is in part due to the fact that as a central narrative, Hannah's narrative doesn't

12:58.080 --> 13:02.560
really receive much scrutiny from the characters, and when it does, these characters are presented

13:02.560 --> 13:08.160
as mostly antagonistic, and therefore not making a sincere case. The flashbacks are hard to dispute,

13:08.160 --> 13:12.480
given how they are mostly promoted as faithful information, and the possible misinformation

13:12.960 --> 13:18.000
isn't given nearly enough to add to that depth. And once again, I don't think this would be a

13:18.000 --> 13:22.400
central problem if Hannah's narrative was presented as inherently flawed, but it's not,

13:22.400 --> 13:26.880
and that means that she's much more presented as this martyr rather than the flawed person

13:26.880 --> 13:32.000
she clearly is as well. A lot of the time, I felt the extent that each individual was responsible

13:32.000 --> 13:36.880
had a level of ambiguity surrounding them, and by the end, I don't think people are remotely

13:36.880 --> 13:41.680
the wiser, because the characters being held accountable never really have much of a discussion

13:41.680 --> 13:47.840
regarding it. Characters like Justin, Courtney, Marcus are so irrationally out to sabotage Hannah

13:47.840 --> 13:52.320
and make sure Clay doesn't release this information, it becomes a melodrama, which

13:52.320 --> 13:56.400
ultimately neglects that this could have been a poignant look at responsibility.

13:57.360 --> 14:18.800
And it's not like I'm sure these characters shouldn't have angry or rational interactions,

14:18.800 --> 14:23.200
but the best moments of the TV series were when they were having low key conversations,

14:23.200 --> 14:27.760
or moments when there was absolutely no dialogue at all, and we were finding out things about these

14:27.760 --> 14:32.960
characters that made them human too. Too much of the focus was on this cover-up plot, which just

14:32.960 --> 14:37.360
reached levels of ridicule at points, and it detracted from the grounded nature of how teens

14:37.360 --> 14:41.600
might deal with these things. I feel that there is such a melodrama, it made it hard for me to feel

14:41.600 --> 14:46.560
emotionally invested. On the contrary, one of the best characters was Hannah's mother, Olivia.

14:46.560 --> 14:52.160
Whenever she was on screen, I felt compelled, because she conveyed the grief and pain from

14:52.160 --> 14:56.960
the experience of losing your own daughter, and that was something that I felt was so neglected

14:56.960 --> 15:02.960
elsewhere. She wanted justice, and she generated realistic melodrama, her pursuit against the school

15:02.960 --> 15:08.000
for justice seemed well founded yet disruptive, which is the right balance, and one that isn't

15:08.000 --> 15:13.280
obtained elsewhere in the story. A lot of people have spoken about how each tape isn't really

15:13.280 --> 15:18.160
proportional against who they're directed towards, and I agree to an extent, I think the problem

15:18.560 --> 15:23.040
is less that some of the tapes had less serious topics, but moreover the fact that they focused

15:23.040 --> 15:27.520
on the individual rather than the feelings that they represented. Abandonment, embarrassment,

15:27.520 --> 15:32.000
betrayal, alienation are all factors that can really drive someone to a deprived mental state,

15:32.000 --> 15:37.360
however often they're a lot less accountable to individuals, more so just general environment and

15:37.360 --> 15:42.480
circumstances, and I feel the directed blame was a case of trying to prioritise melodrama over

15:42.480 --> 15:46.720
realism. However, the fact that Hannah seems to assign those feelings to an individual means that

15:46.720 --> 15:50.880
the actual feelings that drove the reaction seem underrepresented, and this is where the

15:50.880 --> 15:55.600
whole revenge narrative is at its ugliness. The problem is that the whole motivation of this

15:55.600 --> 16:00.400
impending lawsuit by Hannah's mother is that the high school culture was responsible, a culture

16:00.400 --> 16:06.480
that many people are only really guilty of being complicit, with a few exceptions. Because some of

16:06.480 --> 16:10.960
the individuals in the tapes don't necessarily do anything drastically terrible, however as a

16:10.960 --> 16:15.920
recipient of the worst of high school culture, Hannah Baker should have been aware that naming

16:15.920 --> 16:21.120
people directly in a tape linked to her suicide could really negatively impact their lives if

16:21.120 --> 16:25.360
these tapes were released. The whole point was that high school students were creating social

16:25.360 --> 16:30.640
hierarchies off surface level judgements, what would make any of the people on the tapes above

16:30.640 --> 16:34.160
that scrutiny, some of whom clearly didn't deserve it.

16:46.080 --> 16:50.720
Characterisation is another point that many people feel wasn't covered well enough in the series,

16:50.720 --> 16:54.800
and that's an important factor considering that the show makes the assertion of starting a

16:54.800 --> 16:59.120
discussion around mental wellbeing. For me, it's a mixed bag, there are some really good

16:59.120 --> 17:03.120
interactions that would reflect someone going through those stages of suffering, and obviously

17:03.120 --> 17:07.360
there needs to be some conflict, that's how plots are created, but there are multiple points where

17:07.360 --> 17:12.560
the high school seems ridiculously over the top. There's at least one scene where all the students

17:12.720 --> 17:16.960
just take their phones out at once and start smirking at the same time, talking amongst each

17:16.960 --> 17:21.840
other, and it's so contrived. Often they try to make Hannah out to be at the mercy of the whole

17:21.840 --> 17:26.560
damn school, I think this was because they wanted to frame it as her having nowhere to go eventually,

17:26.560 --> 17:31.200
but you really didn't need to do that to generate that feeling. Once again, if they could frame the

17:31.200 --> 17:35.840
paranoia that such rumours create, rather than pretending that paranoia is only the reality,

17:35.840 --> 17:40.560
then they would kill two birds with one stone, they'd accurately represent the flawed state of

17:40.560 --> 17:44.960
mind that that mentality creates, and they'd accurately portray the high school environment,

17:44.960 --> 17:49.760
rather than merging the two and presenting that perception as truth, something that would serve

17:49.760 --> 17:55.360
to perpetuate the idea that this scenario is much worse than it actually is. It panders to negative

17:55.360 --> 18:00.960
stereotypes that suicidal audiences are most prone to believing, and presents it as verity.

18:00.960 --> 18:05.600
As a show that wants to connect with a more vulnerable audience, that sort of outlook seems

18:05.600 --> 18:14.560
rather inappropriate. As 13 Reasons Why goes, it presents itself as a discourse on accountability

18:14.560 --> 18:19.200
and responsibility. We observe a group of students come to terms with their participation in a toxic

18:19.200 --> 18:23.680
culture, this narrative could have worked if it was presented through the eyes of a neutral party,

18:23.680 --> 18:28.320
or no party at all, but the problem is that we have the added detail that the narrative is

18:28.320 --> 18:33.200
presented by the victim themselves. This was clearly to add height and conflict, and more

18:33.200 --> 18:37.840
intimacy, but in doing that, while combining it with the motivation to create a fully accurate

18:37.840 --> 18:42.160
portrayal, they succeed in making Hannah the perfect victim. The problem is that because

18:42.160 --> 18:46.400
the narrative is post-mortem, it is presented without challenge, and we never really learn

18:46.400 --> 18:51.200
much about Hannah or her imperfections, even when she might behave in a way that seems irrational,

18:51.200 --> 18:56.160
it's never subject to much scrutiny, because the narrative just continues. The only real dispute

18:56.160 --> 19:00.880
comes regarding whether she's lying, and we all know how well that plotline is pursued.

19:00.880 --> 19:05.360
In an attempt to keep the narrative as rational and coherent as possible, it undermines the fact

19:05.360 --> 19:09.680
that many suicide victims have mental health problems and other factors that will influence

19:09.680 --> 19:14.640
a person's mental state to drive them to that position. It goes too far to rationalise the

19:14.640 --> 19:20.080
situation, even if it notes that it is not a good option. It makes the act seem very calculated,

19:20.080 --> 19:24.560
which is what leads people to this revenge narrative. I don't think the premise necessarily

19:24.560 --> 19:29.760
comes across as vengeful, but it's very easy to look at that delivery and see it as just that,

19:29.760 --> 19:34.320
a really good example is in the final episode, where the flashback takes us to the school

19:34.320 --> 19:38.160
counsellor's office regarding a sexual assault case, which honestly is something we'll get to

19:38.160 --> 19:41.840
very soon, but in this instance, the counsellor isn't empathetic enough.

19:41.840 --> 19:47.040
It happened, Hannah, and I believe you, but if you won't confront him,

19:48.320 --> 19:55.920
then the only other choice is to move on. Yeah, that's just what I'm gonna have to do.

19:55.920 --> 20:00.480
But the flashback also goes the distance to make sure it is very clear that no one is blatantly

20:00.480 --> 20:04.480
in the wrong, but afterwards, Clay's narrative cuts through implying that the counsellor should

20:04.480 --> 20:08.720
have pursued her after she gave him the impression that she didn't want to talk, a very strong

20:08.720 --> 20:13.200
impression, I must add. There could have been legitimate discussion at that point for what

20:13.200 --> 20:17.360
more can and can't be done sometimes, but they just kind of leave the point unchallenged,

20:17.360 --> 20:22.880
ending on this romanticised final, who really cares speech. People did care, and I think

20:22.880 --> 20:27.680
setting the bar that high justifies an unfair expectation from many people, and undermines

20:27.680 --> 20:30.800
their own humanity in a way, and what they may be going through as well.

20:30.800 --> 20:34.960
I think I made myself very clear that no one's coming forward to stop me.

20:37.120 --> 20:43.200
Some of you cared, none of you cared enough, and neither did I, and I'm sorry.

20:45.760 --> 20:50.400
And I understand, I guess, what they were trying to do with the idea that everyone has a perspective,

20:50.400 --> 20:54.640
it is a running theme, but the problem is that vulnerable individuals looking to adopt Hannah's

20:54.640 --> 20:59.040
perspective would find it rather easy to do so because the narrative isn't presented as flawed

20:59.040 --> 21:03.200
enough. The show starts a discussion, but one of the points of view implied by the narrative

21:03.200 --> 21:08.960
dictates that an individual can be justified in taking their own life on the basis of circumstances

21:08.960 --> 21:13.440
assumed, which is something that I and a lot of people don't agree with. There's been a lot of

21:13.440 --> 21:18.480
controversy surrounding the increased rates of suicide following the show, it's hard to prove

21:18.480 --> 21:22.640
anything with post-hoc measurement, and it's not an environment that would be ethically viable to

21:22.640 --> 21:27.680
manipulate, so cause and effect can never really be established. It's also impossible to measure

21:27.680 --> 21:32.000
how many lives the show may have saved, so I do take this perspective with a grain of salt,

21:32.000 --> 21:37.200
but typically the concern from many individuals is that such a suicide depicted and published

21:37.200 --> 21:42.000
can provoke copycat incidents. Ironically, a copycat incident is depicted on the show

21:42.000 --> 21:46.480
when one of the characters, Alex, tries to shoot himself following this ongoing conflict.

21:47.120 --> 21:52.160
There are researchers who posit that it may well be the famous suicide scene that causes this,

21:52.160 --> 21:56.640
but I think it's more likely to just be the general theme of the show. You don't want to give

21:56.640 --> 22:03.040
people any reasons why, let alone 13, not unopposed at least, and the challenges against these reasons

22:03.040 --> 22:07.440
just come across as a bit lackluster. Now, the scene itself is controversial in other ways,

22:07.440 --> 22:12.080
in fact it's so controversial that Netflix removed it altogether, bit late for that, but I've seen

22:12.160 --> 22:16.560
many people praise it for its rawness, and as a scene that feels important to the storyline,

22:16.560 --> 22:22.000
a convergence of the narratives, and I'll say it, it is powerful. However, at the same time,

22:22.000 --> 22:25.840
those scenes aren't gonna be the ones that start discussions, they're gonna be the ones

22:25.840 --> 22:30.320
to provoke emotional reactions, and although artistically it might feel like the right thing

22:30.320 --> 22:35.760
to do, socially I can see why a lot of people took issue with it. I don't know if the crew

22:35.760 --> 22:41.280
behind 13 Reasons Why anticipated that their audience were gonna be as sensitive as they were,

22:41.280 --> 22:45.840
from what I understand, a lot of disclaimers have been placed in post-release, and I guess it would

22:45.840 --> 22:50.400
have been hard to completely ascertain that, but if they wanted to start a discussion, they should

22:50.400 --> 22:54.480
have been more considerate of the boundaries of that discussion, particularly when they appear to

22:54.480 --> 22:58.720
be trying to connect with that audience. I have a feeling that the whole discussion narrative

22:58.720 --> 23:03.360
was conjured up when they realised that they had some pretty severe incoming criticism,

23:03.360 --> 23:08.240
maybe that's just my more cynical side talking. Another prominent couple of sensitive scenes that

23:08.240 --> 23:12.960
are shown include two sexual assault scenes, one of which where the main protagonist is a victim,

23:12.960 --> 23:18.160
one where she is witness. Both of these are perpetuated by Bryce, the main antagonist,

23:18.160 --> 23:22.560
and probably one of the better written characters. He definitely captures the very two-sided nature

23:22.560 --> 23:27.440
that a charismatic jock can portray, while still operating his power in very malicious ways.

23:27.440 --> 23:33.040
These scenes will be upsetting to some, and that's important to note, and I do leave that disclaimer here.

23:33.040 --> 23:39.200
I ragged on it a lot, but I actually don't dislike season one for what it was, I dislike season one

23:39.200 --> 23:43.840
for what it claims to be. Generally, there's a lot that I liked in the show too, a lot of nice moments

23:43.840 --> 23:48.240
which challenged perception. As said, any scene with the mother was genuinely riveting for me,

23:48.240 --> 23:52.880
and Dylan Minnette does a pretty good job too, conveying a confused friend who doesn't know what

23:52.880 --> 23:59.440
to do. As a show, I was entertained, I was taken in, but there is a clear narrative, a clear voice that

23:59.520 --> 24:03.760
the show expects us to listen to, and without awareness, this can lead to shortfalls in the

24:03.760 --> 24:08.640
representation of the realistic worldview that the show attempts to convey, and could help people

24:08.640 --> 24:14.000
easily rationalise otherwise irrational actions that only make sense in the universe for the

24:14.000 --> 24:20.480
writers of 13 Reasons Why Construct, playing into paranoia and mental clarity. This polarises the

24:20.480 --> 24:25.600
debate, and makes Hannah seem like a vengeful psychopath to some, and like a martyr to others.

24:25.600 --> 24:30.080
Neither are true, and yet the show seems to retreat from the idea of nuance and excusing

24:30.080 --> 24:35.200
various shortfalls as inspiration for discourse, and that is the failure of season one.

24:35.200 --> 24:39.520
However, I will say that there are some good discussions where it touches on the ambiguities,

24:39.520 --> 24:43.600
there's this really good conversation between Clay and the school counsellor towards the end.

24:43.600 --> 24:47.120
Clay- Just to imagine what Hannah's last days were.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.960
Try to understand what led her there.

24:53.840 --> 24:57.440
I cost a girl her life because I was afraid to love her.

24:59.440 --> 25:01.440
You can't love someone back to life.

25:04.640 --> 25:05.680
You can try.

25:05.680 --> 25:11.120
And there are a few of these strong interactions that I do genuinely respect. Generally, I prefer

25:11.120 --> 25:16.080
a Clay's journey than Hannah's, and I think not having Hannah's narrative spelling it out may have

25:16.080 --> 25:21.440
created a better show, but there are only 13 tapes, and season two was around the corner. There was a

25:22.320 --> 25:25.440
There was a lot they could change and improve on, were they?

25:29.840 --> 25:30.640
No.

25:44.640 --> 25:49.680
The source material for 13 reasons why the teen novel was all used for the first series.

25:49.680 --> 25:54.080
This meant the creators had fewer boundaries holding them back, and combining them to perhaps

25:54.080 --> 25:58.720
the trappings and shortfalls of such a premise. Would they squander this newfound freedom?

25:58.720 --> 26:02.960
The answer is an affirmative yes, and its failure, I'd argue, is even worse.

26:04.320 --> 26:09.040
By this point, they must have had the memo that they were starting a discussion, so their

26:09.040 --> 26:13.920
contribution would at least be valued on those merits as well. Series 2 takes place with the

26:13.920 --> 26:18.960
arch of the ongoing court battle between Hannah's mother and the school, whom she wishes to hold

26:18.960 --> 26:24.320
accountable for her daughter's death. This time, each episode is based on the testimony of someone

26:24.320 --> 26:28.560
related to Hannah, most of these individuals having been addressed on the tapes themselves.

26:28.560 --> 26:32.560
It was a nifty little concept on paper, one of the biggest problems that immediately yielded

26:32.560 --> 26:37.040
was that there was not nearly enough they could say, not as much as they would need to at least.

26:37.680 --> 26:42.480
In 13 reasons why season 2, they repeat a lot of the trials and tribulations that the characters

26:42.480 --> 26:47.040
in season 1 went through, leading to frustration at points. For example, the main protagonist,

26:47.040 --> 26:51.280
Clay, has significant issues opening up. The arch of the first season provides the feeling

26:51.280 --> 26:56.160
that it's good and healthy to open up sometimes a nice message, and holding these problems in

26:56.160 --> 27:00.800
only leads to greater complications. In the second season, this problem repeats itself again,

27:00.800 --> 27:02.320
which leads to similar discussions.

27:17.040 --> 27:24.800
Now it's not out of the ordinary for someone's personal issues to resurface, however,

27:24.800 --> 27:29.040
the feeling of relapse occurring was pretty depressing and frustrating for me to watch

27:29.040 --> 27:33.520
personally. Clay repeats a lot of conflicts, and it becomes tiresome, it didn't really have much

27:33.520 --> 27:39.760
to add within the themes during the season, so what did it add? Melodrama. A ton of melodrama,

27:39.760 --> 27:43.600
there were people being beaten up, there were guns, there were knives, and at this point,

27:43.600 --> 27:47.280
I felt I should be more annoyed, but at least they were making it obvious they were happy to

27:47.280 --> 27:52.000
betray this narrative that this was a quote realistic high school environment, and I stress,

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
there probably are some high school environments that are rife with weapons, safety hazards,

27:56.000 --> 28:00.640
and various other issues that shouldn't be ignored. However, the problem is, it doesn't work

28:00.640 --> 28:04.640
for the premise, the brutality of certain high schools in America is reflected in various

28:04.640 --> 28:10.000
socio-economic conditions that need to be in place in such a narrative too. There's no normalization

28:10.000 --> 28:14.960
of violence in high school for 13 reasons why, particularly in the first season, it is treated

28:14.960 --> 28:19.600
with the shock and horror, yet it happens on such a regular basis that you can't help but see it as

28:19.600 --> 28:23.840
anything but forced conflict. Once again, to add weight to my point of rehearsed storylines,

28:23.840 --> 28:28.160
the main cause of all this conflict is the fear that those who testify will incriminate some of

28:28.160 --> 28:32.960
the worst individuals involved, which leads to various scares and sabotages, and the rest.

28:33.680 --> 28:38.640
Because the thing is, in high school, everyone's watching you all the time.

28:41.520 --> 28:42.640
You have to be careful.

28:43.680 --> 28:48.320
Now the high school represented in 13 reasons why was never the most realistic, but it could isolate

28:48.320 --> 28:52.000
the struggles that these students were going through, and at least allow you to connect with

28:52.000 --> 28:56.080
them. That's not something that's really identifiable in the second season, there are some

28:56.080 --> 29:00.160
things that have happened between the end of the first and the start of the second season that I

29:00.160 --> 29:04.160
personally didn't like. Clay is now in a relationship with a character who was previously

29:04.160 --> 29:09.040
not involved at all in the storyline, and therefore I just felt awkward watching it as I couldn't see

29:09.040 --> 29:13.680
the chemistry develop. It was done for the purpose of creating a conflict that Clay keeps comparing

29:13.680 --> 29:17.840
other females with Hannah, but it seems forced, and any interactions that arise from it are

29:17.840 --> 29:22.000
extremely uncomfortable to sit through, because I could never really accept the premise that

29:22.000 --> 29:23.280
these two people were a thing.

29:24.000 --> 29:38.480
This relationship ends pretty quickly when she's taken away to a mental facility, but it underlines

29:38.480 --> 29:42.800
another huge problem, which is just how easily people are emotionally provoked into hostile

29:42.800 --> 29:47.520
confrontation. One of the characters who finds himself in confrontation is Mr Porter, whose

29:47.520 --> 29:51.040
mild mannered counselling suddenly turns into high school vigilantism.

30:11.040 --> 30:14.720
And although you could argue it's the mindset of someone who has nothing left to lose,

30:14.720 --> 30:19.280
that sort of behaviour could completely compromise your testimony in court, and leads to nothing

30:19.280 --> 30:25.120
being achieved other than another angry black man trope box ticked. I understand it's an emotional

30:25.120 --> 30:30.320
time for people, but multiple people just seem so angry, entitled, and petulant. Probably the

30:30.320 --> 30:35.200
worst example of this is the now recovering Alex, who following his failed suicide attempt will

30:35.200 --> 30:40.480
just have the spontaneous outbursts out of nowhere. Now on one hand, I empathise with his trauma,

30:40.480 --> 30:44.160
he has this memory loss, which actually isn't scientifically possible, but they're a bigger

30:44.160 --> 30:48.880
fish to fry. His movement is impaired on one side of his body, and he's clearly suffering.

30:48.880 --> 30:53.680
Because the writers use his outburst to make him seem antagonistic rather than tortured,

30:53.680 --> 30:55.840
you end up feeling rather bitter towards him.

31:10.880 --> 31:17.440
Often his eruptions are spontaneous, and they spend much more time focusing on his

31:17.440 --> 31:21.840
emotional reactions rather than any discussion about what he might be going through. It doesn't

31:21.840 --> 31:26.240
mean that those conversations don't exist, they are covered, but you don't really need more than

31:26.240 --> 31:31.040
one of these angry moments to convey what he's experiencing. By the second and third time,

31:31.040 --> 31:36.720
it feels awkward to watch, and so painful for the sake of confrontation. I don't think it does the

31:36.720 --> 31:41.600
suffering of such conditions any justice, but with that said, he's far from the individual

31:41.600 --> 31:46.640
who's suffering the worst treatment of their mental health here. I think that award goes to Clay Jensen.

31:52.240 --> 31:56.800
As I said earlier, the tapes are over, you can't rewrite what was recorded, and it'd be hard to

31:56.800 --> 32:02.080
revive the character of Hannah Baker now that she is deceased. I guess what I should say is that it'd

32:02.080 --> 32:08.160
be hard to revive the character of Hannah Baker in a decent, respectful way, because they revive her,

32:08.160 --> 32:13.920
but my god. In the first season, Clay has visions of Hannah here and there, and you know seeing her

32:13.920 --> 32:18.720
face in other people and so on was understandable, given that he was clearly shaken by the ordeal.

32:18.720 --> 32:23.520
However, by the second season, she begins to talk and have full on conversations with Clay.

32:23.520 --> 32:27.920
On concept, this could represent an internal monologue between a person who is rather torn on

32:27.920 --> 32:31.680
the right thing to do, but the writers make it very clear that they do not want it to be

32:31.680 --> 32:33.040
interpreted that way.

32:52.320 --> 32:58.160
So this left me with two options, either Hannah has come back as a ghost, or Clay Jensen's visions of

32:58.160 --> 33:02.640
Hannah now talk to him. Neither of these options are particularly desirable to me, but given the

33:02.640 --> 33:06.640
fact that ghosts would not be thematically congruent with the outlook the show is going for,

33:06.640 --> 33:11.680
and mental health seems to be the focus, I'm going to take a guess and say it is the fact that Clay's

33:11.680 --> 33:17.280
visions are worsening. This could also be proven due to the fact that Hannah often cannot answer

33:17.280 --> 33:21.760
Clay's questions, even when the answer seems simple, thus suggesting she is a manifestation

33:21.760 --> 33:25.840
of his own limited perception, while also providing more frustrating conversation.

33:28.160 --> 33:51.600
Clay may be able to allege that this is a sign of schizophrenia in Clay, or something similar,

33:51.600 --> 33:56.240
and I'd have to agree, and yet throughout the whole series, Clay just continues to live with this

33:56.240 --> 34:00.960
apparition of Hannah, having continuous conversations, the writers acting as if it's just

34:00.960 --> 34:05.680
nothing, as if he's just going along, it even escalates in exactly this way towards the end.

34:05.680 --> 34:09.600
Clay's vision of Hannah becomes worse, probably drawn from the frustration that they have been

34:09.600 --> 34:14.800
unable to obtain justice for the girls that Bryce has sexually assaulted. This vision of Hannah then

34:14.800 --> 34:24.720
begins to repeat Bryce's take, the one which Hannah talks about her experience, and this causes him to

34:24.720 --> 34:30.960
go to Bryce's house with the intent to shoot him, before turning the gun on himself. At this point,

34:30.960 --> 34:35.280
the point should be, this is bad, and Clay needs help, and yet he's just escorted home,

34:35.280 --> 34:39.840
and nothing, nothing at all is done about it, and okay, it can be difficult when we're suffering

34:39.840 --> 34:44.240
from these illnesses to open up about them, but throughout the series, this apparition is presented

34:44.240 --> 34:49.040
so passively that it never feels like the writers are even challenging you to think about it in that

34:49.040 --> 34:53.440
way, other than the scene where she's literally screaming at him, she might as well be one of the

34:53.440 --> 34:58.480
families, but okay, maybe I'd be a bit more forgiving if this is given an arc, and he confronts

34:58.480 --> 35:03.920
this vision, or at least there's some closure, but it's so unbelievably insulting that it annoys me

35:03.920 --> 35:08.720
just to speak about it. In the final episode of the series, they have Hannah's funeral,

35:08.720 --> 35:13.520
Clay says a eulogy, it's a good eulogy for what it's worth, but at the end, we just see Hannah's

35:13.520 --> 35:18.880
spirit exiting, as if that's the closure we deserve to such a tortured arc. The vision's now gone,

35:18.880 --> 35:24.320
we can all be happy, hooray, and in a sense, that sort of closure worked with how they presented

35:24.320 --> 35:29.040
her, but she shouldn't have been presented in that way, with so little awareness to what she

35:29.040 --> 35:33.600
represented in Clay's mind. If you're not distracted by how poorly Hannah is written,

35:33.600 --> 35:39.040
you're pissed off that this is a concept they thought was just asceptible to present as this

35:39.040 --> 35:43.840
thing. This was a problem, and I don't think it should be downplayed. Another person whose

35:43.840 --> 35:49.600
mentality is just completely butchered is Tyler, now Tyler being the creep who photographed Hannah,

35:49.600 --> 35:54.480
is pretty much ostracised from many of the main characters, and this isolation can be dangerous.

35:54.480 --> 35:58.480
They definitely set the grounds for him as a volatile character, and in this season,

35:58.480 --> 36:03.680
he finds belonging with individuals who like him are social outcasts, he partakes in various

36:03.680 --> 36:08.640
rebellious behaviours which detail him attacking the social hierarchy in the school through

36:08.640 --> 36:14.000
vandalism and the rest. Now this quickly goes downhill, as he doesn't really understand how

36:14.000 --> 36:18.480
to fit in properly, and mistakes edge for cruelty, and eventually falls out of place with those

36:18.480 --> 36:23.200
friends too. Now I could talk about how clumsily that is handled, and how his actions don't really

36:23.200 --> 36:28.160
make sense, but let's give him the benefit of the doubt on that basis and say, ok, he is socially

36:28.160 --> 36:37.200
awkward, they don't have to make sense. So after being distanced from this group, he posts

36:37.200 --> 36:41.920
incriminating photos detailing his involvement in the vandalism of school premises, he is

36:41.920 --> 36:47.440
reprimanded by the headmaster, and disciplined accordingly, or at least how they feel is accordingly.

36:47.440 --> 36:52.560
Now up to a point, I could see how someone's isolation leading to apathy could drive destructive

36:52.560 --> 36:56.960
thoughts, and it's even shown subtly in some scenes, such as the one where he shoots a crow,

36:56.960 --> 36:58.560
and has an interesting reaction.

36:58.560 --> 37:27.040
For those who are unaware, Tyler is meant to be the school

37:27.040 --> 37:31.680
shooter kid, and in certain episodes, they're trying to outline his sensitivity to the possible

37:31.680 --> 37:36.400
radicalisation that such environments might produce. It's a hard line to walk, because as

37:36.400 --> 37:40.320
always, you don't want to make the school shooter narrative seem too rational, you need to portray

37:40.320 --> 37:44.800
him as an outlier, but you have to make it real. However, probably high off the backlash they

37:44.800 --> 37:48.880
received for making it too rational in the first series, the writers go in totally the opposite

37:48.880 --> 37:53.440
direction, and make his turn seem prompted by a scene that I'm going to have to describe.

37:54.320 --> 37:58.480
Part of his discipline for the vandalism incurred him going on a correctional course,

37:58.480 --> 38:03.680
he goes away for a certain amount of time, and seems to come back as a changed man. However,

38:03.680 --> 38:08.080
on the first day back, a character known as Monty, who is known for being aggressive,

38:08.080 --> 38:14.080
violently attacks him with his goons in the toilet, before ramming a mop stick up his anus,

38:14.080 --> 38:19.040
and this upsets him so much that by the evening he's just off to shoot up the school dance.

38:19.040 --> 38:24.160
The scene upset me a lot, to be fair, mainly because I felt it was unnecessary. Not only

38:24.160 --> 38:28.080
do they really fail to document the gradual descent that many people in these scenarios

38:28.080 --> 38:33.520
go through, but they have to include a really ham-fisted scene that was basically used as

38:33.520 --> 38:44.720
a vehicle to justify why he did what he did, and the misrepresentation doesn't stop there.

38:49.040 --> 38:58.720
Now, although it was a great misrepresentation, it was the perfect representation for what the

38:58.720 --> 39:03.360
show had become, a show that viewed sensitive issues as a pit stop rather than a natural

39:03.360 --> 39:08.720
source of discussion. It felt lazy, it felt exploitive, and it doesn't seem to understand

39:08.720 --> 39:13.520
how to initiate that conversation it seems to care about. Giving someone basic information,

39:13.520 --> 39:18.800
or just showing them a really sensitive scene isn't enough to start a conversation. If I tell

39:18.800 --> 39:23.200
someone that the square root of 64 is 8 and then ask them to solve the hodge conjecture,

39:23.200 --> 39:27.120
it doesn't mean I've sufficiently informed or equipped them to have that discussion.

39:27.120 --> 39:31.200
These scenes are the sort of thing that will shock someone, and not necessarily give them

39:31.200 --> 39:35.120
much to say, I don't know how I was meant to respond to that scene. The scenes just

39:35.120 --> 39:39.600
discussed were the huge standouts for obvious reasons, and it's completely understandable,

39:39.600 --> 39:44.080
they were done for the sole purpose of shock value. With the first season's suicide scene,

39:44.080 --> 39:47.760
you could at least make the argument from an artistic perspective it had been built up

39:47.760 --> 39:52.400
appropriately. With this said, in season 2, there were plenty of other scenes that were now added

39:52.400 --> 39:57.040
in to embellish the timeline which just felt frankly inappropriate. Most of these scenes

39:57.040 --> 40:01.280
were around the basis of Hannah, as shown by various testimonials. In the first season,

40:01.280 --> 40:05.440
the tapes were presented as a nearly wholly accurate representation of the environment

40:05.440 --> 40:09.920
that Hannah was subjected to. The second season uses flashbacks to add various details,

40:09.920 --> 40:14.880
which I suppose were meant to be twists, but all they did was throw into contention a lot

40:14.880 --> 40:20.080
of testimonials in her first season. One of the worst examples of this is Zack. In the first

40:20.080 --> 40:24.800
season, Hannah puts him on his tape for fairly minor reasons, but ultimately he was there for

40:24.800 --> 40:29.200
the loneliness that he represented and caused her to feel through his own actions. However,

40:29.200 --> 40:33.280
the second season creates this whole subplot where they were actually having some sort of

40:33.280 --> 40:38.720
relationship which renders a lot of the original narrative for the first season presented pointless.

40:38.720 --> 40:42.320
Also, quick side note, they say this about 2001 A Space Odyssey.

40:58.880 --> 41:03.920
I don't know exactly what they were trying to say here, but don't. Just don't. The second season

41:03.920 --> 41:07.680
felt like they were trying to fix the errors of the first season, but ultimately just ended up

41:07.680 --> 41:11.920
creating more errors themselves, without the source material they tried to grip onto characters

41:11.920 --> 41:16.560
who honestly didn't clearly have much else to them, so the writers just made them angrier,

41:16.560 --> 41:22.160
more volatile, leading to more conflicts. But also them just creating these new situations

41:22.160 --> 41:26.080
like they did with Zack, where individual testimonies reveal new information.

41:27.040 --> 41:38.400
I assume they anticipated this, and tried to deflect it in the script here, but this is no

41:38.400 --> 41:43.200
valid response. It's not about Hannah including everything about a person, it's about including

41:43.200 --> 41:47.600
the relevant arguments for why a person led Hannah to take her own life, and this story paints Zack

41:47.600 --> 41:52.080
like a completely different person to the one portrayed in the first season, and makes Hannah's

41:52.080 --> 42:05.120
take basically redundant. Another one who does that is Bryce. They make it seem like she actually

42:05.120 --> 42:10.000
had something with him, before revealing that she actually didn't, but she still spent some time

42:10.000 --> 42:14.240
with him, so I guess it was meant to show that she actually isn't lying, but the fact that she

42:14.240 --> 42:19.040
admitted certain details like these in her takes regardless wasn't a good look, it kind of ruins

42:19.040 --> 42:24.480
the first season for me. It's like the prequel film that no one wanted, it's like Shrek 3 but

42:24.480 --> 42:29.200
Prince Charming just keeps having flashbacks to Shrek 2. Don't try and fill in the gaps with

42:29.200 --> 42:34.720
Shyamalan style twists, it's daft and unrealistic and only serves to sacrifice the character that

42:34.720 --> 42:40.000
you presented in the first season. Speaking of character assassinations, in episode 10 there is

42:40.000 --> 42:44.640
this character that I think everyone has forgotten, but I have not, because I was actually really

42:44.640 --> 42:49.840
annoyed about it. This is Sarah, she is introduced at the end of episode 9, and is thrown in literally

42:49.840 --> 42:55.040
the episode after as someone who has been a victim of Hannah's bullying at a previous school.

43:04.960 --> 43:09.760
This character has no other introduction, and once again is used as a source for unnecessary

43:09.760 --> 43:14.080
conflict, however arguably the most insulting element to her inclusion is that logically

43:14.080 --> 43:18.960
speaking she wouldn't serve the purpose that the writers intended her to. Basically, she's there

43:18.960 --> 43:24.880
to undermine Hannah's credibility as a victim, to accuse her of being a bully at a different school,

43:24.880 --> 43:29.200
after all, if she was a bully at a different school, how could she be a victim at this one?

43:29.200 --> 43:34.080
This may work if her credibility was actually on the chopping board, but there are already numerous

43:34.080 --> 43:39.600
testimonies that say she was unfairly treated, even from people who misrepresented and attacked her.

43:39.600 --> 43:49.840
It's important to remember that the question was whether the school had failed to protect her,

43:49.840 --> 43:54.160
which was the point of the lawsuit, and if the prosecution lawyer had been more diligent,

43:54.160 --> 43:59.600
he could have easily flipped this to say that the school in that district, this other story of Sarah,

43:59.600 --> 44:05.440
also failed to protect this individual against high school bullying and harassment. This whole

44:05.440 --> 44:11.520
conflict changes nothing and only serves to fill out the 13 episode runtime, it was a stupid

44:11.520 --> 44:16.240
diversion whose themes were never really explored regardless. I guess the point of the courtroom

44:16.240 --> 44:21.040
was to try and illuminate how unjust many court decisions are, but their route of doing it was

44:21.040 --> 44:26.480
to write out the school's attorney as antagonistically as possible and then have the decision

44:26.480 --> 44:27.880
come out in their favour.

44:27.880 --> 44:30.280
And isn't it true that your vandalism

44:30.280 --> 44:33.240
caused thousands of dollars of damage to Zach Dempsey's car?

44:33.240 --> 44:36.760
I was angry at him. I paid for the damage.

44:36.760 --> 44:39.160
What did you do when you were angry at Courtney Crimson?

44:39.160 --> 44:41.000
I just took her to Hannah's grave.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.840
Are you responsible for Hannah's death?

44:43.720 --> 44:48.040
Yes. There are kids who did a lot worse, kids who you let skate,

44:48.040 --> 44:51.000
who did things that you won't even talk about, and adults at liberty-

44:51.000 --> 44:53.160
Request to strike that answer as non-responsive.

44:53.160 --> 44:54.120
So ordered.

44:54.120 --> 44:59.880
Now I'm not saying that attorneys can't be this way, but it's simplistic and two dimensional.

44:59.880 --> 45:03.880
At one point, Clay's mother was going to be the attorney representing the school, and although

45:03.880 --> 45:08.280
I understand why her character would pull out due to the vested interest, it would have been

45:08.280 --> 45:13.400
more interesting to see her battle with her own principals and her client's interests while still

45:13.400 --> 45:18.040
trying to understand who's responsible. Instead, we have this very vindictive character who we're

45:18.040 --> 45:24.040
basically told not to like. It's okay to challenge your audience sometimes, you know, the whole arc

45:25.000 --> 45:28.600
of season 2 is utilised to tell the audience that we're meant to root for the school to lose,

45:28.600 --> 45:32.040
and when they don't, we're meant to lament the injustice of the system.

45:32.040 --> 45:36.360
But honestly, I'm not so sure about that. Let me elaborate.

45:48.200 --> 45:52.760
As I understand, the court case is meant to indict the school as culpable in Hannah's suicide.

45:52.760 --> 45:57.000
Now in the first season, this discussion and responsibility is kind of juggled between parties,

45:57.000 --> 46:01.000
and the school environment is definitely brought up, and for what it's worth, there actually is

46:01.000 --> 46:04.920
a discussion to be had. Hannah's parents are initiating the lawsuit against the school,

46:04.920 --> 46:09.720
but it's also framed as an emotional decision and one done from people in exceptional grief,

46:09.720 --> 46:12.840
trying to find a reason for why their daughter took her own life.

46:23.560 --> 46:41.720
The school is presented as clumsy, shallow, and occasionally irresponsible, but never is it really

46:41.720 --> 46:46.920
implied that the school had to pay for what they had done. It was a barrage of conflicting feelings

46:46.920 --> 46:51.960
with no clear answer. In the second season, the show pulls out all the stops to make sure the

46:51.960 --> 46:56.520
school is shown in the worst light possible artistically, while circumstantially trying

46:56.520 --> 47:01.320
to present the situation as completely unjust, so there are fights, threats, and so on,

47:01.320 --> 47:05.880
yet barely any of this is mentioned in court that could actually incriminate the school environment.

47:05.880 --> 47:09.720
In fact, I believe the only person who does openly mention it is Jessica Davis.

47:21.960 --> 47:29.960
If everything that happened in the school was reported in court, you might have a more

47:29.960 --> 47:34.360
watertight case, but nothing really is reported, and we're meant to be angry when the court comes

47:34.360 --> 47:39.160
to a decision that the school is not culpable, and after a while, I just reflected and felt that the

47:39.160 --> 47:43.960
decision was completely reasonable. The first series asked questions about responsibility,

47:43.960 --> 47:48.840
and the second series was just like, yep, that was the school. It doesn't help that honestly,

47:48.840 --> 47:53.320
a lot of the questions from both the school and family attorneys were about individual

47:53.320 --> 47:57.240
involvement, implying that this individual behaviour was accountable to the school.

47:57.240 --> 48:01.640
Now of course, only one side was arguing this, but it essentially became an argument of tone

48:01.640 --> 48:06.760
policing, the school was such massive pricks, like the principal for example, he's a big ol' prick.

48:06.760 --> 48:12.280
The most dangerous thing would be to believe somehow that Hannah's suicide

48:12.280 --> 48:19.880
is more than a tragic death. She's not a hero, she does not have lessons to teach us,

48:19.880 --> 48:27.160
and we need to recognise the sad and simple truth that she is dead and gone forever.

48:27.160 --> 48:31.480
These guys are so bad that we're meant to side with the good guys, but that's the thing,

48:31.480 --> 48:35.800
it's one thing being right on the foundations of morals, but it's different when you're trying to

48:35.800 --> 48:40.280
carry out a legal prosecution that implies there should be reimbursements, and implying that the

48:40.280 --> 48:45.320
school didn't do its legal duty. It's a problem, and the question of how paternalistic schools

48:45.320 --> 48:50.840
should be is complex, because taking matters into your own hands comes with its own consequences.

48:50.840 --> 48:55.320
One might ask how involved parents should be in certain matters, and it was hard to prove how much

48:55.320 --> 49:00.280
the school knew while doing nothing. In fact, in the first season, one of the most incriminating

49:00.280 --> 49:05.320
factors such as the inscriptions inside the toilet cubicles was treated with shock, implying that

49:05.320 --> 49:08.600
there was little knowledge, or at least little provable knowledge.

49:08.600 --> 49:10.600
How have we never seen this before?

49:10.600 --> 49:16.360
Oh, well, faculty is not supposed to be in a student's restroom, you know, in college and

49:16.360 --> 49:19.160
tutorial staff to see if they could repaint these walls.

49:19.160 --> 49:24.360
I don't like to side with the big bad institution, everyone knows how anti-establishment I am,

49:24.360 --> 49:29.800
and make no mistake, as they are written to be, they are not good people, but being not good

49:29.800 --> 49:34.920
people doesn't mean that you should lose a court case. I hate to sound nostalgic, but once again,

49:34.920 --> 49:39.160
in the first scene, there's this really sharp conversation between Hannah's mother and Clay's

49:39.160 --> 49:43.080
mother, who at the time was representing the school. I thought they'd make it some

49:43.080 --> 49:47.240
moment to morally signal, but they completely subverted my expectations.

49:47.240 --> 49:52.840
Would you settle for, say, $200,000?

49:52.840 --> 49:57.560
I think I would only settle for the truth, whether I liked it or not.

49:57.560 --> 50:01.320
That's the sort of thing that they were just not interested in doing in the second series.

50:01.320 --> 50:06.200
In the first series, they tried too hard to make certain positions too justified, but in this one,

50:06.200 --> 50:11.640
they just tried too hard to say, no, this is what we meant, and I like it less, and if they did it

50:11.640 --> 50:16.200
with more attention to mental health, I'd probably be less likely to criticise them, at least it'd

50:16.200 --> 50:20.280
be a bit more socially conscientious, but as mentioned earlier, they missed the mark on that

50:20.280 --> 50:26.280
as well. It's the good guys, bad guys, TV drama trying to pass as a serious look on mental health,

50:26.280 --> 50:31.240
and its mental health coverage is just bad. However, if we are to ignore the ridiculously

50:31.240 --> 50:36.600
dramatic ending of the attempted school shooting, one moment that does manage to capture a bit more

50:36.600 --> 50:42.440
realism is the sexual assault situation regarding Bryce, and how hard it is for many individuals to

50:42.440 --> 50:47.240
come forward, particularly given their perception that someone like Bryce has due to his wealth and

50:47.240 --> 50:48.440
prestigious family.

51:02.840 --> 51:07.080
Throughout the series, he's presented as someone under pressure, but also very calculated in his

51:07.080 --> 51:11.720
method to protect his reputation. He's an awful person who has raped multiple individuals, and yet

51:11.720 --> 51:16.840
even when his victims go to the police, he only receives a minor sentence of three months probation,

51:16.840 --> 51:20.920
and his former friend Justin, who is from a significantly less privileged background, ends up

51:20.920 --> 51:25.560
receiving a six month sentence, despite the fact that his worst crime was being too intoxicated to

51:25.560 --> 51:30.040
fully understand what Bryce was doing, and not being persistent enough. This was a somewhat

51:30.040 --> 51:34.520
decent narrative on the failings of the legal system, and how it often comes out in favour of

51:34.520 --> 51:38.840
those more privileged. There's also a good narrative about loyalty and the price of quote

51:38.840 --> 51:43.320
betrayal, I would have much preferred them to focus on that rather than the prosecution of the school,

51:43.320 --> 51:48.120
however I guess that wouldn't fill enough episodes. I think the one scene that I'd use to summarise the

51:48.120 --> 51:53.880
tone of 13 reasons why season 2 is an alternative flashback scene for Mr Porter the school counsellor,

51:53.880 --> 51:58.680
in all fairness, it's not a bad scene, in this reality he chases after Hannah as she leaves and

51:58.680 --> 52:04.200
helps her open up, I kinda like it, but the context of it existing seems to be basically the writers

52:04.200 --> 52:09.320
feeling insecure of how people may have interpreted that scene from last season, either defending Mr

52:09.320 --> 52:10.680
Porter or attacking him.

52:29.640 --> 52:34.200
If that scene had been the first season, I probably would have liked it a lot more, as it would have felt

52:34.200 --> 52:39.880
more ambiguous. If season 1 says here's what you could think, season 2 says here's what you should

52:39.880 --> 52:45.400
think, and I have to admit, I dislike the latter more on principle, there's nothing wrong with trying to

52:45.400 --> 52:50.600
reel in the suicide is justifiable narrative, but they also go after a lot of other narratives too,

52:50.600 --> 52:56.040
which to be honest, weren't necessarily inherently evil points of view, and compromise many of the

52:56.040 --> 53:00.840
not so bad elements of season 1. They are scrambling to appease their complaints, but don't have a grip

53:00.840 --> 53:06.600
on how to do it. Season 2 swaps out discourse for drama, and waters down any substantial elements

53:06.600 --> 53:11.960
that may have given it its appeal in the first place, it is not mental health oriented, and commodifies

53:11.960 --> 53:18.360
a high majority of those topics, that is the failure of season 2. But hey, we could talk about season 3,

53:18.360 --> 53:21.000
they still have time to redeem themselves, so would they?

53:21.000 --> 53:21.500
No.

53:21.500 --> 53:23.080
Well thank you for that contribution, but I have a-

53:23.080 --> 53:27.640
No, you've spoken enough now, we're like 5 hours in and you haven't even reached season 3.

53:27.640 --> 53:29.480
I mean, that's what I was about to get into.

53:29.480 --> 53:35.400
Yeah, well, I'm here now and it's my video, so we can't all be twats with too much free time, can we?

53:35.400 --> 53:37.640
Now piss off and let me talk about this garbage fire.

53:41.000 --> 53:46.600
The show is declining in quality so rapidly, I'm genuinely curious as to how and where it could

53:46.600 --> 53:52.600
possibly go next. If nothing else, season 3 proves that there really is no rhyme or reason as to why

53:52.600 --> 53:58.280
any of this story is unfolding, aside from the fact that it is recognizable, popular, and probably

53:58.280 --> 54:04.840
boosts Netflix subscriptions. As if the fact that a show called 13 Reasons Why is already 39

54:04.840 --> 54:10.360
episodes long wasn't comical enough. We're dealing with the aftermath of an event so distant at this

54:10.360 --> 54:15.800
point that it's very difficult to justify why any of this is truly necessary, aside from the pure,

54:16.440 --> 54:22.680
juicy drama of it all. Season 3 shifts gears in such a way that would be fine if it wasn't treated

54:22.680 --> 54:27.240
like it's doing us some kind of virtuous service, as if this show is anything more than the

54:27.240 --> 54:32.840
melodramatic high school drama aimed at young teenagers that it indeed is. In all honesty,

54:32.840 --> 54:37.400
I kind of enjoy my yearly dose of this series due to the absurd levels they have to stretch

54:37.400 --> 54:42.200
in order to keep this angsty snowball rolling. At the very least, I find it to be somewhat

54:42.200 --> 54:47.240
comically entertaining as a trashy drama aimed at young adults, but I'm not sure that's the

54:47.240 --> 54:56.200
kind of feedback the creators were hoping for. Okay then, if season 1 is about what led to the

54:56.200 --> 55:01.720
end of Hannah Baker and season 2 is about the court case that preceded, then season 3 is simply

55:01.720 --> 55:06.920
a whodunit murder mystery, with the hook or central question of the season being who killed...

55:08.920 --> 55:13.320
All of the marketing was brandished with the question of who was responsible. Who did it?

55:13.320 --> 55:22.600
Who killed Bryce? At this point in the show though, we're very aware of how evil Bryce

55:22.600 --> 55:27.320
Walker is. He's so comically maniacal over the first two seasons that it's obvious he

55:27.320 --> 55:32.840
was set up and marked as the major antagonist, and his comeuppance is the only narrative beat

55:32.840 --> 55:37.400
that has any consequence besides the more pedantic pieces of drama that fill out the

55:37.400 --> 55:44.680
minute-to-minute of the show. In order for this season to come together, the writers decided that

55:44.680 --> 55:50.120
for this story to have any weight behind it, Bryce needed to come across as being more complicated and

55:50.920 --> 55:59.000
well-rounded. So you felt more conflicted over his demise. Problem is, you ideally should have

55:59.000 --> 56:03.240
been sowing those seeds since the beginning to avoid it coming across as retroactive and

56:03.240 --> 56:07.400
kind of cheap. For a show that typically seems to have dealt in pretty clear absolutes,

56:07.400 --> 56:11.720
it's very strange to me that three seasons in is when they suddenly feel inspired to add a

56:11.720 --> 56:15.080
bit of grayness to the intentions of their more controversial characters.

56:20.600 --> 56:24.600
Reminds me of the tropey writing something like The Walking Dead often falls into,

56:24.600 --> 56:28.680
where a minor character suddenly gets an intense backstory that fleshes them out

56:28.680 --> 56:32.280
mere moments before they're killed, so their death appears to have more impact.

56:32.280 --> 56:35.400
With the way the show has been structured and written, it seems obvious to me that

56:35.400 --> 56:39.720
everything after the original material has been composed backwards. They seem to have a

56:39.720 --> 56:44.920
pre-prepared list of dramatic and controversial ideas that fit in line with what made the original

56:44.920 --> 56:51.000
book so famous, or infamous, depending on who you ask, and instead of writing realistic people

56:51.000 --> 56:56.680
that progress in a relatable and honest approach, they appear to force the square peg into a round

56:56.680 --> 57:02.280
hole to continue to double down on this idea that 13 Reasons Why is on the cutting edge of

57:02.280 --> 57:04.120
socio-political commentary.

57:04.280 --> 57:08.840
I think it's mature and responsible storytelling on the part of Brian Yorkie and the writers.

57:08.840 --> 57:11.880
I mean, to- to- it's courageous, too.

57:11.880 --> 57:14.920
So how do they attempt to make you feel sympathy for a violent,

57:14.920 --> 57:20.360
serial abuser fiend? Well, their answer was to hammer home this idea that at the end of it all,

57:20.360 --> 57:25.720
despite the consistent and insistent amount of pure evil he has displayed in front of us,

57:25.720 --> 57:29.800
the, come on guys, he's still a person at the end of the day, right?

57:29.800 --> 57:32.440
He's a f***ing person, Clay. A human being.

57:32.440 --> 57:37.640
One of the main themes of this season is this idea that parents and or family have a huge role

57:37.640 --> 57:42.760
to play in shaping troubled lives. That behind broken or evil people is some kind of underlying

57:42.760 --> 57:48.280
trauma, be it a fiercely homophobic father, a distant unloving mother, or whatever it may be,

57:48.280 --> 57:52.120
which is an interesting idea to explore. There are a lot of movies I like that deal with these

57:52.120 --> 57:57.640
very themes. However, the script here is far too hokey and silly to sell any of it.

58:02.840 --> 58:03.960
Parent entering.

58:05.960 --> 58:09.960
Let's not forget that at the start of season three, Bryce is known to us as the guy who

58:09.960 --> 58:14.520
started the initial rumors about Hannah, viciously sexually assaulted a minimum of three different

58:14.520 --> 58:19.320
people with more implied victims, started more nasty rumors, this time about Jessica,

58:19.320 --> 58:24.440
tormented Zack by messing with Hannah's locker, lied while under oath countless times,

58:24.440 --> 58:28.520
and probably many more horrendous acts I've forgotten about. Now, I don't know about you,

58:28.520 --> 58:33.480
but I don't really think that Bryce could be properly redeemed as a character under any sense,

58:33.480 --> 58:38.440
really, with what we've already seen him do. Like, this is very extreme. Like, what he did is

58:38.440 --> 58:50.040
abhorrent. This guy is eviler than the fucking emperor. The only possible way I could see it

58:50.040 --> 58:55.720
going down was, perhaps, in season three his arc was to come to the realization of what he'd done

58:55.720 --> 59:00.600
and confess the truth to the police and take his punishment like a responsible person. Nah,

59:00.600 --> 59:04.920
he wouldn't be forgiven, but that's the only real way I could see you taking this character in a

59:04.920 --> 59:10.040
sympathetic direction and still maintaining some modicum of reasonable sense. It's true that

59:10.040 --> 59:14.680
suddenly Bryce seems to have some kind of realization in season three about what he's done

59:14.680 --> 59:19.240
and why it was bad. I assume they were going for a conflicted character who was fighting against

59:19.240 --> 59:23.640
the evil instincts that had defined him for so many years, which we learn seems to originate

59:23.640 --> 59:27.400
from a troubled family life growing up with parents that didn't love him properly. The

59:27.400 --> 59:32.200
show abuses the idea that if you have a sad backstory, that automatically makes the concept

59:32.200 --> 59:37.480
of evil deeds inherently more gray. However, as I already mentioned, it's looking for justification

59:37.480 --> 59:41.240
after the fact instead of having some kind of plan for the character from the beginning.

59:41.240 --> 59:45.640
Comes across that way anyway. Intentions aside, the execution of this character is where things

59:45.640 --> 59:51.720
completely fall apart, all for the sake of this ridiculous murder mystery. Bryce follows through

59:51.720 --> 59:56.280
on some of the more dastardly crimes yet in season three. A particular standout moment for

59:56.280 --> 01:00:01.400
me being when he breaks into his dad's mansion to vandalize it, except it's revealed that he

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:07.800
went to the wrong house and winds up threatening a small child with a knife, like an actual deranged

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:16.200
sociopath. Well, I suppose he's only human.

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:22.840
Juxtapose that insanity against the attempts to humanize him and you wind up with some

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:27.480
brilliant unintentional comedy, such as when Bryce and his mother finally bond by throwing

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:40.360
paint on each other. This is without even mentioning the very intentional and petty

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:44.200
physical assault that Bryce commits in the penultimate episode. Story-wise,

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:48.040
this is for the character of Zack to have motivation to beat Bryce to a pulp,

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:53.080
so he can be a red herring for the real killer. But anyway, Bryce decides to plow his body at

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:57.960
full speed into Zack during the chaos of a riot that takes place in the middle of an American

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:07.960
football match in episode 12. This is, of course, fueled by pure jealousy because Zack moved in on

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:14.280
Bryce's ex-girlfriend, likely ruining any chance of Zack's sporting career permanently. Might as

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:19.160
well add a final destroyed life to the pile of chaos that this nasty character has left in his

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:30.440
wake. I mean, to be fair, he is only human. If that wasn't enough to prove how terrible this

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:35.160
character is, I went to the 13 Reasons Why wiki, which is hilarious by the way, where I noticed

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:40.200
some interesting, and pretty poorly written, observations. I find it very curious that for

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:46.120
a supposedly grey character, he has a dedicated section on his wiki listed as enemies, where most

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:51.720
of his crimes are conveniently listed in relation to the major characters. Oh god, wow, what a

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:56.760
horrible person. In the end, Bryce turned out to be a far more complicated character than people

01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:01.000
first believed him to be. His crimes are inexcusable, but he did try to make up for

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:07.480
his crimes and seek some sort of redemption for what he has done. No he didn't. You're talking

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:13.400
about the same character who is listed under his personality section as a cruel, arrogant, spoiled,

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:19.320
manipulative, violent, and selfish person, and is a very dangerous individual. That sounds like a

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:23.560
more accurate description to me. It doesn't matter to me how many times he has a paint fight with his

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:29.240
mother, apologises to his victims, has a weird relationship with his dad, has a go at his meanie

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:33.880
grandfather, or complains about the world, not allowing him to change.

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:41.000
If anything, with the way it's presented, he comes across as a fairly consistent liar,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.160
who is never truly being genuine because as the viewer, we get to see that he really hasn't

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:49.800
changed at all. It's even revealed that he's managed to fool multiple therapists.

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:59.720
As well as being responsible for having Tony's entire family get deported.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.760
That's most of what bothered me about this character in this season,

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:17.560
aside from one important detail I guess. That being his relation to a new member of the cast.

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:27.960
Annie, or Lil Annie as I like to call her, is arguably the protagonist of season three,

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:32.840
which is a strange decision for multiple reasons. She is essential to the structure of the season,

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:38.040
with her narration being framed as a recounting to the police of the full murder mystery story,

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:42.520
as you later find out. I don't really understand why it was necessary to add yet another person

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:47.400
to this already huge cast, aside from the need to have a vessel that everyone can dump exposition

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:52.280
onto and over explain everything, as well as being a new face to have in a love triangle between

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:57.080
Clay and Bryce. Yeah, there are so many love triangles it's hard to keep track. Lil Annie is

01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:01.240
written as an irritating know-it-all, who loves the sound of her own voice and miraculously

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:05.960
instantly connects with everyone that she meets, as a weak writing trick designed around shortcutting

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:09.720
the need to have her relationships progress in a more believable manner.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.280
She's a blank slate who is used to second guess and constantly question everyone

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.520
to keep them spouting the awful dialogue.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:28.040
Oh my god, it is bad. She's also got a British accent for some reason,

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:32.840
which I hate because I obviously- I hate British people and their stupid accents.

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:39.480
She quickly gets dangerously entangled in the entire affair, forming a strange relationship

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:46.600
with Bryce and sleeping with him multiple times. It doesn't make her a very likeable character,

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:50.440
but at least she knows by the end it was an extremely immoral thing to do.

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:56.520
Yes, it was the worst thing you've ever done. She's the most proactive character in terms of

01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:00.440
moving the mystery of the plot along, with her motivation being that she wants to find out who

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:04.920
murdered Bryce because of her intimate involvement with him. I find it odd that they insisted on her

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:10.520
being the lead detective of the story, instead of the literal policeman- sorry, police officer,

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:14.920
who has been established, I think since the beginning, multiple seasons. Turns out he's

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:20.600
the father of the murderer too, so that would be inherent added drama, but I suppose that would

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.760
distract from the high school tween nonsense.

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:24.760
We will get you whatever help you need, Justin.

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.560
Oh, spoilers.

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:35.800
I decided to lump these characters together for a couple of reasons.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:39.720
First of all, as if one love triangle wasn't enough, they needed to have a pesky little

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:43.880
cheating side quest going on in the background, with Jessica juggling a relationship with the

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:47.960
two fellas at once to add to the theater of it all. I already spoiled it, but it's revealed

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:52.680
that technically Alex is the one who deals the final blow to Bryce, so he gets credit for the

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:56.760
kill. It's fine though, because they agree to frame another character I haven't mentioned yet,

01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.840
Monty. We'll get to him later though.

01:05:58.840 --> 01:05:59.960
You're a crazy bitch.

01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:03.160
Yeah, and you should fear that.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:10.440
The murder scene is a complete mess because of the shift Bryce goes through depending on

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:14.600
what is convenient at the time to the script, but first he tries to make a case that he's

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:19.080
trying to change and that the world won't let him, even though he's- he's hasn't really done

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:24.040
anything aside from continue to be evil. Even going as far as to have made a confession tape

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:28.600
to give to people instead of just telling the police, why would you do that? However,

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:34.120
the moment he's helped up by Alex, he says he's going to destroy Zack and break his other knee,

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:41.480
which you might justify as him being angry in the heat of the moment. He did get his ass kicked

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:47.480
after all. But to me, it comes across as if his true nature is to be a violent maniac,

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:53.480
as we've seen for three seasons. Either way, Alex kills him and they cover it up. The characters

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:57.800
are covering up murders at this point. The main cast is so morally bankrupt at this point that

01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:02.280
I'm pretty sure there isn't a single one of them that doesn't belong in jail for the seriousness

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:07.480
of their crimes. I suppose you could make a case for some of them before people were being beaten

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:13.000
and murdered and hiding weapons so the police don't find out- what the- what is going on?

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.240
Is that where you guys dumped Tyler's guns?

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:15.800
Correct.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:19.160
But it's hard to root for these characters considering the lengths they're willing to go

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:22.920
to lie and cover up the truth of what really happened. They appear to make up their own

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:27.320
moral code as they go along and take the law into their own hands, which would be fine if

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:32.280
this show was treated for what it is and not sold as if it's this important learning tool

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:35.240
for young people to start having a conversation.

01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:38.440
The show, which obviously is a weighty and important show-

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:42.680
Justin doesn't particularly get up to much this season aside from dealing drugs from

01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:46.840
the 13 Reasons Why coffee shop they're all obsessed with. I suppose this and any other

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:50.600
show would be quite a big deal, but that's a relatively tame story beat compared to

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:54.440
everything else that's going on. We're told that Justin has an intense bond with Clay

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:58.760
as he was adopted into the Jensen family last season, but I can't help but wonder why Justin

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:02.120
wasn't used more in the investigation side of the mystery. It would have made a lot more

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:06.200
sense to me to have Justin and Clay team up to find out the truth of what happened. It's

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:10.040
not like a lack of motivation would be an issue seeing as they both have fairly intimate

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:14.040
backstories with Bryce at this point. I suppose we always have next season to explore the

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:15.960
sexual tension of Justin and Clay.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:21.640
I'd do anything for you. Anything. Same.

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:30.120
This character cannot seem to catch a break. His first love killed herself, one lover had

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:35.880
a bipolar breakdown and changed school, and his latest fling chose a serial sex offender

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:40.280
over him. But that's not to say that this character is particularly likable otherwise.

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:44.280
I have no issues with the actor, I don't blame him at all. In fact, the actors are probably

01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:48.280
the only reason anyone likes this show to begin with. However, Clay is so earnest and

01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:52.040
trusting of everyone, to the point where I'm fairly sick of him and his bullshit.

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:53.260
What?

01:08:55.480 --> 01:09:00.200
His character really started to crumble the moment he put himself in front of an armed

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:05.400
shooter in a misguided and dangerous attempt to be like a superhero like one of the comics

01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:06.200
he loves so much.

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.920
You just ripped my favorite character to shreds.

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:13.080
At first I was disappointed that the ghost visions of Hannah that were prevalent in season

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:18.200
2 had subsided, seemingly for good. However, they had to have at least one scene where,

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:22.760
this time, Clay has a showdown with Ghost Brice, which I quite enjoyed.

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:27.480
I may be gone from this earth, but I will be reborn in the bodies of a million men.

01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:32.680
My theory is that the next season is gonna be, in part anyway, about some kind of mental illness

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:36.840
that Clay is diagnosed with. My reasoning for this being that in one scene, his parents

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:41.000
question Justin in a way that seems to indicate they have reason to believe he has something

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.560
going on mentally. We'll have to wait and see on that one though.

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:51.880
Clay's main purpose in the story this season is to be another red herring. You're supposed

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:55.880
to believe that he was capable of being the one who murdered Brice. It even goes so far

01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:00.200
at one point that he's the main suspect in the case and is actually arrested. I fail to feel

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:04.600
much sympathy for him though, because ultimately this entire situation could have been avoided

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:09.480
if he wasn't such a moron and kept secrets from everyone. This school shooter aspect has spiraled

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:14.600
the plot out of control so fast, all because of the way most of the characters agreed to cover for-

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:23.160
Season two obviously ended with the bombshell of Clay stopping Tyler from going Columbine,

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:27.640
so the results ripple into season three and have to be explained away with the most moronic

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:31.880
decision-making this group has made yet. Instead of getting this kid the help he clearly needs

01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:36.600
and making sure he takes liability for his actions, they dividend responsibility between

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:42.200
the group and implicate themselves to make sure Tyler is never given a chance to snap again

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:47.880
and murder people. Yeah, that's their plan. Wow, these mental health expert children.

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:50.680
Most characters are deeply frightened of what he's capable of.

01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:58.920
And Clay even admits that he has nightmares about being slaughtered by him.

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:02.280
In the dream, you pull the trigger.

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:07.000
Luckily though, Tyler is made out to be such a sweetheart to make sure to justify the ridiculous

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.160
actions of last season. They try to make the case that it was all worth it in the end,

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:16.120
that Clay made the right decision. Step in front of a shooter. Go on, that's clever,

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:20.120
because he's just a human after all. However, being the complete imbeciles that they are,

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:25.720
they decided to hide his bag of dangerous firearms in the water where fishermen constantly peruse,

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:30.120
so obviously the season ends with a tease of the guns being found, implying that part of next

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:35.480
season all sorts of drama is going to unfold. I'm glad, quite frankly, they deserve everything

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:39.960
that is coming to them. Most of the scenes with Tyler are him apologizing for nearly killing his

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:45.560
classmates and coming to terms with the horrendous abuse he received in the last episode of season 2

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:46.280
at the hands of...

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:53.160
Um, so yeah, Monty kind of steps in as the lead villain in Liberty.

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:58.120
This character is fairly similar to Bryce. He's not quite his mustache twirling, but they take his

01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:02.200
character in a similar direction in terms of giving him a sad backstory, where it turns out

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:07.000
he's a closeted gay with a nasty father. His main role in the plot is to effectively be set up as

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.680
another red herring and eventually be the fall guy for Bryce's death.

01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:14.360
Monty realized that the cycle had to be broken somehow.

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:19.000
So the others can get away with murder and cover it up. He also conveniently gets killed

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.520
off-screen, as we're told by the police that he was killed in jail.

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:27.400
But Montgomery De La Cruz was killed in his jail cell just hours ago.

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:31.160
I suppose you can have a crystal clear conscience, can't you, you monsters?

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:32.680
Okay, he was a human being.

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:33.960
Oh, gosh, shut your face.

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:42.040
This is the final character I briefly want to talk about because he's my personal favorite.

01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:45.400
He's the only one who calls the group out on their idiotic decision-making.

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:51.720
This is bullshit. I'm out. I'm scared of you. And to be honest, I don't trust you.

01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:01.640
We even see how kind he is to Bryce's ex-girlfriend in the fairly preachy

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:05.000
Planned Parenthood episode, which I haven't really talked about because...

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.360
I'm going to explain the procedure to you, and you will order some paper now,

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:12.040
and you will come back Saturday morning. When you return Saturday,

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.320
we will take your blood pressure.

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:19.800
That's most of what stood out about season three to me.

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:22.920
There's plenty of minutiae that could be talked about in more detail,

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:26.200
but honestly, I could be here forever talking about how bad this is.

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:29.400
As you can tell, and you'll especially know this if you've watched it yourself,

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:32.360
this is easily the messiest and most ridiculous season yet.

01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:35.560
It so desperately wants to be taken seriously that it winds up becoming

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:39.320
even more of a parody of itself than the depths it sunk to in season two.

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:43.080
It's utterly tone-deaf, nothing about the production is particularly interesting

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:46.440
in terms of presentation, and even when they attempt something stylistic,

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:47.800
it falls flat on its face.

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:50.520
I'm of course talking about the ridiculous amounts of flashbacks

01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:53.400
the show is structured around that have a slightly different color palette,

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:56.760
but the timeline is so muddled, it doesn't do much to help you understand

01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:59.400
where and where a scene is supposed to be taking place.

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:03.320
The gross oversimplification of heavy subjects is as bad as ever,

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:06.520
shock value is appreciated over any real character arcs,

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:09.960
and the murder mystery angle is an extremely silly, pulpy beat

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:12.760
that only adds to the overall melodrama of the show.

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:16.760
Personally, I found it to be fairly enjoyable in a so-bad-that-it's-good kind of way,

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:20.120
mostly because of the shock of where the writers chose to take this season,

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.600
and I have to say I'm fairly excited for how they're going to

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.600
attempt to continue this mess of a story,

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:26.680
but this is no doubt the weakest season yet.

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:29.400
They've written themselves into such a corner by forcing the show

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.480
to go so far beyond its source material,

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:33.800
that at this point I'm curiously along for the ride,

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:37.560
purely for how they're going to try to keep this material weighty and important

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.800
while the stupidity continues to escalate.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:41.960
I suppose they're the winners in the end, though.

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:44.840
They kept this conversation going for a bloody long video,

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:48.440
so I suppose that's the failure of 13 Reasons Why season 3.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.040
It's really bad.

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:53.240
Thank you, I hate everything.

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:55.480
What a delightful appearance.

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.160
He truly is a loving person.

01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:59.000
Let's finish this off, then.

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:08.680
If 13 Reasons Why was just about the first season,

01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:11.560
we could have a fair discussion about how it treats its subjects,

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.880
where it comes through, and where it falls short.

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:17.880
By the time it's continuing to string along various audiences by two and three

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:20.360
with these narratives that are frankly rather worrying

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.040
when treated the way they have been,

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:25.000
it reaches a stage where one has to ask whether it's worth it.

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:29.400
With a full season on the horizon, I know there is not really much I can do.

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.520
From what I understand, it will be the final season of the show, thankfully,

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:35.880
but it seems mad to me that in the face of numerous critically acclaimed shows

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:38.840
being cancelled, this one has continued to steamroll through.

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:41.640
It sucks, because I do feel that everyone deserves better.

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:45.640
The cast deserves better, the topics deserve better, the audience deserves better.

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.800
I'm sure there are a lot of people who care about this,

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:50.680
but whoever's in charge just doesn't care enough,

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:54.200
or doesn't understand enough to make it seem like they care.

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:57.800
It's hard to make a show that has this discussion, I understand that.

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:01.240
You can't expect to put your foot in the right place all the time.

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:04.760
I know I couldn't, and there will undoubtedly be times where you deal with criticism

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:08.520
for the handling of something that people may feel has negative implications,

01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:10.200
and that doesn't mean you're wrong,

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:13.560
it just means it's a sensitive topic that people feel strongly about.

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:16.600
However, with 13 Reasons Why, in each progressive season,

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:19.800
the creators seem to care less and less about the creation of narratives

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:22.840
that actually discuss these problems, and more just touching on them

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:27.320
for the sake of conflict through a provocative reaction, and that genuinely sucks.

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:30.120
It sucks that they can just put a little disclaimer at the start,

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:33.720
and think that they're sufficiently preparing people for what they're about to experience.

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:37.720
It's like putting an age rating on a game, who actually abides by that?

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:41.960
Difference is that this is mental health, and an assertion of realism in this world,

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:46.680
and a lot of games are more clearly defined on the bounds of reality and fantasy.

01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:51.400
It doesn't change much, and it certainly doesn't change their failure to handle topics with nuance,

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:55.720
and the only real reason that it's continuing is because it indulges a certain audience

01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:59.480
who is going to continue to commit to watching it, and I get it,

01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:03.480
there aren't too many shows that have attempted to portray mental illness in teenagers,

01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:08.040
though they're out there, but as many people have noted, this doesn't do it accurately,

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:12.600
and it misses out on one of the greatest elements, the element of getting help.

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:16.200
I would like to have seen a few scenes where a character has professional therapy,

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:20.120
talks over the problems they're encountering, the problem is that they never seek help,

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:24.840
and the fact that they try to talk about it with other students who are mentally volatile too

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:28.440
leads to this heightened conflict, and it might be good to create a plot,

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.600
but it's not really what you should be promoting.

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:34.120
There should be a point where characters like Clay Jensen are seeking help,

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:37.240
because by the third season, he is just painful to watch.

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:40.840
I hope at the actual end of the fourth and final season, he goes and gets help,

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:45.000
because I feel like the only reason they've been holding off that is to build conflict.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.600
The school counselor is the closest they get to that solution, and even then,

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:52.760
the only character who really has an ongoing relationship is Tyler in the third season,

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:55.640
and most of those discussions are nice, but not that deep,

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:59.400
and the fact that it takes them three seasons to get there is kinda sad.

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:02.520
Also, they still never really frame it as a clear solution,

01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:04.760
more just another plot element that's there,

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:07.720
but I guarantee if some of these characters took some time out,

01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:11.240
they'd probably feel a lot better, but that's not what drives conflict.

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:15.000
If you're suffering from mental health difficulties, there may be solutions out there.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.960
Not every solution works for everyone, I understand that,

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:23.080
but I don't think 13 Reasons Why is good for vulnerable people looking for a quote discussion.

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:25.880
Speaking as someone who has had his own mental problems,

01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:28.520
the show left me extremely emotionally drained,

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:31.080
probably around the midpoint of the third season,

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:34.280
I felt at my lowest point mentally I had in months,

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:36.200
and I don't think that was a coincidence,

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:39.000
because everyone was just so unnecessarily angry,

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.040
the conflict grates on you, all that negative energy,

01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:44.440
at the end you're almost relieved they resolved it,

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:47.080
but after being relieved, I felt conned,

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:51.480
they just forced a load of bullshit conflict and then resolved it to make me feel better.

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:56.200
It's like setting a building on fire, putting it out, and calling yourself the fire brigade.

01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:59.320
They've had three seasons to get this right,

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:02.680
going by their baseball standards I'd say that's three strikes,

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:05.400
if you've watched it and it's changed your life for the better,

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:07.160
I cannot take that away from you,

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:10.040
but I think they've really failed to change a lot of people's lives,

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:13.640
and I'd be skeptical of how much they have helped the conversation.

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:17.320
If you're not doing great mentally, this show wouldn't receive my endorsements,

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:21.960
I think it's a placebo of sorts, and one that provokes a reaction that wears off rather quickly,

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:25.640
at this point I'd normally recommend a series that does handle it better,

01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:28.200
but to be honest, I haven't really watched that many,

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:32.600
one that my friends always recommend is Bojack Horseman, which I definitely plan on watching soon,

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:36.360
though if any of my audience members would like to share some ideas of good shows

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:38.280
about mental health in the comments below,

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:41.160
then I'm sure there'd be people out there who'd love to hear them.

01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:45.000
If you're doing mentally well, 13 reasons why I wouldn't get my endorsement either,

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.760
because seasons 2 and 3 especially just outright suck.

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:53.400
Overall conflict, contradictory values, and generally just what appears to be a motivation

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:56.200
to milk the discourse rather than actually contribute to it,

01:19:56.200 --> 01:20:01.080
and the fact that it has persisted despite the criticism from people all over the creative

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:06.600
and medical spectrum is the failure of 13 reasons why we are done here.

01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:14.280
So yeah, that was the video, a really really fun one, so much fun,

01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:20.840
I had such a great time making it, and I hope that I can continue having a great, fantastic time,

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:25.480
I'd like to give a big shout out to the editors, they did a fantastic banger job,

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:31.320
fist bumps to all the editors, I don't know who you are yet, but I love you, I love you guys.

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:36.280
Shout out to my Patreons, my big old Patrons, oh Patrons, I used to call them Patreons,

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:40.280
but some people get annoyed that I call them Patreons, because I'm just trying to define them

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:46.520
from the regular Patreon, but I'll say Patron, so shout out to my Patrons, hey,

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:51.320
and all the ones that are $10 plus are on the screen right now, but we're not finished there,

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:56.200
we gotta give some more special shout outs, because I've got some big, big names,

01:20:56.200 --> 01:21:03.480
I got a big shout out to Be More Cool J, what a cool dude, Brandon, Christopher Karras, Stanton,

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:09.960
all $100 Patreons, and they're my $50 Patreons, Caroline, Hypercube, and some Hullabaloo,

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:15.080
I did it in different order this week, you see I'm feeling extra spicy today, but thanks again guys,

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:21.560
you're all the best, you're all the dogs, and I appreciate and love you guys, so,

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:28.440
I don't really have much else to say, keep up the fantastic work, and if you wanna speak to me,

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:32.120
you can reach out to my Twitter, that's probably one I reply on the most, though I haven't been

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:36.600
getting to DMs too much recently, because I've been busy, probably that's the best shout,

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:40.840
Discord in the pinned comment, Facebook also in the pinned comment, though I haven't been using

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:48.600
that much recently, Instagram too, I sometimes chill on there, so, not too much else to add,

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:57.960
have a good week, I've given up with the world, but I'm still here, so take care, chaps,

01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:59.960
all you fantastic chaps.

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:12.840
I'll see you guys in the next one.
