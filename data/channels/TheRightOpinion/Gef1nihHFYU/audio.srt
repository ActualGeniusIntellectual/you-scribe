00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,920
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the right opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,480
and TV shows, honestly something that I have an interest in, but seldom get around to actually watching.

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,640
My biggest problem is how much time they tend to consume, and although I promise you I have too much free time,

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,400
TM, it's not that I typically decide to dedicate all towards one TV show, I like to allocate it across various

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,360
activities to maintain some mental wellbeing, because after all, in this world called YouTube, we can all use that

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:38,320
from time to time. I mostly indulge my time in films, which are typically shorter in total, with exceptions,

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,960
and gaming, because as I have always asserted, I am a gamer. Nonetheless, recently I have found myself in an

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,400
interesting predicament because YouTube's slow monetization process has basically delayed so many of my videos

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,200
that I found myself with a weak on my hands, and a desire to cover something slightly different.

10
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,200
So without further ado, I suggest we tackle that slightly different subject on this glorious, glorious day,

11
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,400
and if you have some basic reading capabilities, you will know that this is 13 Reasons Why.

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:13,600
13 Reasons Why is a TV show that currently spans three seasons, although a fourth is expected too, so hooray for that.

13
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:20,160
It is based on the young adult novel by Jay Asher, and the first series was released originally in 2017,

14
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:26,720
to a furor of applause and acclaim from critics and audiences alike. However, it is not without its controversy.

15
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,440
What is the basis of this controversy? Well, 13 Reasons Why is a show that, like many films and TV series,

16
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,720
tackles tough issues. However, one of the central characters and narrators of this show, someone by the name of

17
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,160
Hannah Baker, is resenting their narrative from the perspective of a deceased individual, but on top of that,

18
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:50,000
she committed suicide, and left behind 13 tapes. These 13 tapes were each addressed to an individual

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,280
who she felt had played a role in the situation that finally resulted in her death. These tapes would then

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,720
circulate through each subject, being passed on until they completed their cycle. It is a show that asks

21
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:06,480
questions regarding accountability, school environments, but it's also very graphic and intense, and not for the

22
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,000
faint of heart. When covering any sensitive topic in a dramatized fashion, there will almost always be

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,440
controversy, because many people have many different feelings on how to deal with these topics, and many

24
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,320
people will have strong feelings on them, and therefore, even the occasional misstep will be viciously

25
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,360
scrutinized, because if these things aren't done with the utmost delicacy, it could also lead to dangerous

26
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,200
social outcomes. The first season of 13 Reasons Why was promoted under the guise of mental health discourse.

27
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,160
In fact, if you watch the version now, you might see a disclaimer from one of the cast members stating that

28
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,720
the intention of the series is to start a discussion, it was a significant marketing point. Therefore, at first

29
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,640
when it came out, I kind of theorized that its messages probably bordered on inflammatory at points, but didn't do

30
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,000
anything too egregious, because overall, it has still been well received. However, by the time the second season

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,440
came, I began to well have second thoughts. The first season had been based on the book, as mentioned, however,

32
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,880
the second season completely deviated from that, and I felt that move veered more on the side of exploitive,

33
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,160
especially given how the original series was promoted. I assume maybe there was just a heavy demand, maybe it

34
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,800
made a significant difference to some people's lives, but regardless, given the moderate success of the first

35
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,880
season, I understood why it existed. Nonetheless, this season was not well received by critics, and audiences

36
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:28,000
didn't seem to be particularly ecstatic either, although it is difficult to tell how the committed fans reacted.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,960
I assumed this would be the end, however, I was rather irritated when I heard that there would be, in fact,

38
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,800
a third season, a move that I found frankly rather insulting, but ho-hum, maybe it would be better.

39
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,600
Okay, never mind then, I figured at this point, a majority of the audience must have been but the most

40
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,560
dedicated viewers of this show, who clearly felt that the messages mixed with the high school environment

41
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,520
resonated with them. I really didn't see much additional value being drawn from it, and I also developed

42
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,080
a sentiment of concern, because if they're still trying to send these social messages about all of these

43
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,200
topics yet receiving such a significant amount of criticism, they can't be doing a particularly good job.

44
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,160
My concern here was that, ultimately, 13 Reasons Why had an audience who supported them on the basis of

45
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,400
their takes on these sensitive issues, yet their artistic failure to carry through these messages

46
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,800
could well have negative social ramifications, particularly if the intended audience were more

47
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,360
vulnerable individuals. Now, I did not guarantee to find exactly this, but I also know that there has

48
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,400
been a lot of debate over it, and I hope to at least provide my own stance on it, with a caveat of caution

49
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,760
and nuance to those interested in watching the series. There's an inconvenient truth, sometimes what

50
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,640
might be most critically acclaimed or artistically bold or emotionally gripping may not be the best

51
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,480
for an individual's health, and that's something that comes particularly to a head with a show like

52
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,600
13 Reasons Why, and for a show that attempts to tread both borders with some amount of sensitivity,

53
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,720
I'd say it's ultimately a fundamental failure, and with the fourth season on the horizon, it should

54
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,600
probably take a moment for some self-reflection in its messages. The accrue behind 13 Reasons Why

55
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,520
has made it clear that their intended audience has been those who are mentally vulnerable,

56
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,320
and therefore that is something that cannot be discounted. I'm aware that my voice will

57
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,320
ultimately have very little effect, and the show will continue to steamroll its way into Brian

58
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,640
Yorkie's bank account, but if this video makes anyone take another look at the show, then I consider

59
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,040
that a victory. I'm going to be outlining the plot of each season, before diving into my own personal

60
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,960
thoughts and feelings regarding how the show tackles these issues, and the success slash

61
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,680
shortcomings of this coverage, so without further ado, I suggest we get into it. I will

62
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,920
preface this by saying that there will be spoilers. Let's go.

63
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,120
Now I briefly mentioned the premise of season 1 while introducing this video, but I shall go into

64
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,440
a bit more depth. There are two narratives that we have to observe, the first one being

65
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,760
Hannah Baker, the deceased individual whose narrative is presented post-mortem on these

66
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,720
13 tapes, and mostly follows her account through the state of flashbacks, and the second being the

67
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,360
recipient of these tapes, Clay Jensen, whose narrative is mostly followed through present day.

68
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,240
There is an episode dedicated to each tape, we follow Clay as he listens to them, and sometimes

69
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,560
struggles to listen to them, interspersed with relevant flashbacks which run adjacent to Hannah

70
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,960
Baker's narrative. We also follow Clay's own reaction to this, which may lead to certain

71
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,240
behaviour when certain truths are revealed. There are many various arcs, as would be expected

72
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,200
on a TV show, but the tapes are directed at individuals whom Hannah feels contributed to

73
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,600
her suicide, sometimes through merely being complicit in a culture, or just being a straight

74
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,240
out rapist. Hannah's parents are planning to sue the school for their inaction, and other students

75
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,400
who are the subjects of these tapes are trying to prevent the release of these tapes. Another

76
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,360
student, Tony Padilla, keeps an eye to make sure each person listens to these tapes. There are many

77
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,720
other minor conflicts and tensions, but I shan't focus too much on them. Now, realism is a really

78
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,600
important point when staying committed to recreating these environments. Not every film or

79
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,280
TV show has to abide by basic fundamental laws that we may expect from the real world, in fact,

80
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,400
many don't, even the ones that may seem grounded in principle. But 13 Reasons Why has a few more

81
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,280
rules to abide by because they seek to portray the human condition, and environments that market

82
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,400
relatability to their audiences. Therefore, certain elements of logic and realism have to be followed

83
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,440
by in these instances. So realism will be discussed here, not just from a social perspective, but from

84
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,240
an artistic perspective as well. I want to first focus on the premise, the fact that Hannah is

85
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,800
recording the series of tapes, and directing them at specific individuals following her death.

86
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,360
This has probably been one of the major sources of the controversy, being called out by many as

87
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,080
unhealthily indulging in revenge fantasy. Now, this is where we should talk about the portrayal

88
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,160
of Hannah Baker herself. She isn't the sole focal point of the narrative, and therefore,

89
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,440
the writers have a bit more leeway to not present her as this all positive protagonist. Therefore,

90
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,160
I didn't immediately object to her having less than amiable intentions regarding the creation of

91
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,480
these tapes, because ultimately, it is the framing of the character that would define how she is

92
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,440
presented to the audience. People don't always do the best thing, it's just important that there's

93
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
some awareness of that.

94
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,680
Hannah Baker- See, I can guarantee that one of the reasons that you're still listening

95
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:13,120
is that you really want to know, who are the others? Who else is responsible for my death?

96
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,520
Unfortunately, 13 Reasons Why doesn't really have that. For me, I received the impression that Clay's

97
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,080
present day reaction was meant to be the core narrative that we were meant to emotionally follow,

98
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,560
with certain deviations when he lashed out a little.

99
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,760
Clay- Then she's not helping.

100
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,840
Clay- I don't wanna help.

101
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,960
And even those behaviours seem to fall on Clay, rather than Hannah. Ultimately, their handling was

102
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:42,320
a failed opportunity to look into the dangers of creating a series of tapes. Accountability

103
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,200
doesn't dissipate after you die, and although the tragedy should never be undermined at the

104
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,680
same time, we shouldn't be afraid to analyse the morality of the actions themselves that

105
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,920
come before. If the writing of other characters wasn't so on the nose, then their nuance may

106
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,760
have been able to come through, because there are characters who dispute the release of these tapes,

107
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,920
and even the details. For example, Jessica Davis, the subject of the second tape,

108
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,960
tells Clay that Hannah was lying about certain details.

109
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:12,080
Jessica- What she said? On the tapes? About us and Monet's? She's the one who stopped coming,

110
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,880
not me. She's the one who ended our friendship, and she knew it. She's a liar.

111
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,520
It wasn't a liar.

112
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,120
However, by the end of the same episode, they use blatant dialogue to tell the audience that

113
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,240
she clearly wasn't lying. Jessica- If Hannah was lying, why are you here?

114
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,320
It was such an underplayed conflict that it basically had no reason to exist,

115
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,800
and it was a missed opportunity to look into the implications of such tapes. When someone

116
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,920
takes their own life, they are more often a victim of some circumstance. However, at the same time,

117
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,000
content published with knowledge of their impending death may be questionable in its

118
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,600
information, for two reasons. Firstly, a deceased individual won't have to face down the consequences

119
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,720
of those narratives, and secondly, as they are a perceived victim, it will yield their post-mortem

120
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,440
content more power, which is exactly what is demonstrated in season two, but we'll get to

121
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,400
that eventually. However, even with that said, it is revealed later on the tapes that she did

122
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,120
get a detail wrong, regarding another tape directed at Zack, a high school student who

123
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,120
basically stole compliments from Hannah's compliment bag after she embarrassed him

124
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,320
publicly. In the tapes, she says he threw a compliment away.

125
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,480
Jessica- I was hoping once you read the letter, you'd get it. You'd realize how much I needed

126
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,320
those silly things you were stealing from me.

127
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,560
I guess I wasn't even worth the reaction.

128
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,240
And yet, it's revealed he actually kept it. However, this habit of getting details wrong

129
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,760
doesn't appear again, so I'm not really sure what we're meant to do with it.

130
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,920
The only basis that it would have changed under is if we were still unsure about the validity of

131
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,280
the tapes, but the subjects of the tapes act in such a purposefully self-incriminating way that

132
00:10:51,280 --> 00:11:03,360
it's not a point of contention, so ultimately, it just becomes this loose end, and we're left

133
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,840
wondering if we should be lending the emotional value to the tapes that the writers clearly want

134
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,960
us to. It's hard to tell if revenge is the direct motivation, however, it does appear at multiple

135
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,280
points throughout the series. Probably the worst example of this is in episode four, a tape

136
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,240
dedicated to an individual named Tyler, a creep who took photos of her at her home, and evaded

137
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,640
her privacy, finally escalating when he took and shared a picture of her kissing another girl

138
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:52,400
named Courtney. In her tape, she says this. This is followed by Clay, the present-day protagonist,

139
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,040
taking a picture of Tyler's bare buttocks and sending it to the whole school. Now this was a bad

140
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,360
idea for many reasons, and some characters even observe this, but there's little resolution or

141
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,040
focus that says how bad an idea this was, and it was a really bad idea. Let's go into that.

142
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,120
Bad ideas, they're common in this show, sometimes that's okay when they're framed as bad ideas,

143
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,000
but often you end up with this sort of ass pic scene, no real closure because the tapes have

144
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,800
moved on to their next subjects, and this leads to some real incoherence on actual morals.

145
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,760
Scenes like those are made to stick out, made to shock, and therefore they stick in your head,

146
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,320
and when I reflect on them, I don't really think they had any resolve or any conclusion that was

147
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,200
meant to be presented to the audience. By the end of episode seven, and thus tape seven, Hannah Baker

148
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,760
says this. Hannah Baker- No one knows what's really going on in another person's life,

149
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,560
and you never know how what you do will affect someone else.

150
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,280
Which is 100% true, but it's also a factor that has been neglected multiple times throughout

151
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:58,080
the series. This is in part due to the fact that as a central narrative, Hannah's narrative doesn't

152
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,560
really receive much scrutiny from the characters, and when it does, these characters are presented

153
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,160
as mostly antagonistic, and therefore not making a sincere case. The flashbacks are hard to dispute,

154
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,480
given how they are mostly promoted as faithful information, and the possible misinformation

155
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:18,000
isn't given nearly enough to add to that depth. And once again, I don't think this would be a

156
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,400
central problem if Hannah's narrative was presented as inherently flawed, but it's not,

157
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,880
and that means that she's much more presented as this martyr rather than the flawed person

158
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,000
she clearly is as well. A lot of the time, I felt the extent that each individual was responsible

159
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,880
had a level of ambiguity surrounding them, and by the end, I don't think people are remotely

160
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,680
the wiser, because the characters being held accountable never really have much of a discussion

161
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,840
regarding it. Characters like Justin, Courtney, Marcus are so irrationally out to sabotage Hannah

162
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,320
and make sure Clay doesn't release this information, it becomes a melodrama, which

163
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,400
ultimately neglects that this could have been a poignant look at responsibility.

164
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:18,800
And it's not like I'm sure these characters shouldn't have angry or rational interactions,

165
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,200
but the best moments of the TV series were when they were having low key conversations,

166
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,760
or moments when there was absolutely no dialogue at all, and we were finding out things about these

167
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,960
characters that made them human too. Too much of the focus was on this cover-up plot, which just

168
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,360
reached levels of ridicule at points, and it detracted from the grounded nature of how teens

169
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,600
might deal with these things. I feel that there is such a melodrama, it made it hard for me to feel

170
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,560
emotionally invested. On the contrary, one of the best characters was Hannah's mother, Olivia.

171
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,160
Whenever she was on screen, I felt compelled, because she conveyed the grief and pain from

172
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,960
the experience of losing your own daughter, and that was something that I felt was so neglected

173
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:02,960
elsewhere. She wanted justice, and she generated realistic melodrama, her pursuit against the school

174
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:08,000
for justice seemed well founded yet disruptive, which is the right balance, and one that isn't

175
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,280
obtained elsewhere in the story. A lot of people have spoken about how each tape isn't really

176
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:18,160
proportional against who they're directed towards, and I agree to an extent, I think the problem

177
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,040
is less that some of the tapes had less serious topics, but moreover the fact that they focused

178
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,520
on the individual rather than the feelings that they represented. Abandonment, embarrassment,

179
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,000
betrayal, alienation are all factors that can really drive someone to a deprived mental state,

180
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,360
however often they're a lot less accountable to individuals, more so just general environment and

181
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,480
circumstances, and I feel the directed blame was a case of trying to prioritise melodrama over

182
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,720
realism. However, the fact that Hannah seems to assign those feelings to an individual means that

183
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,880
the actual feelings that drove the reaction seem underrepresented, and this is where the

184
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,600
whole revenge narrative is at its ugliness. The problem is that the whole motivation of this

185
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,400
impending lawsuit by Hannah's mother is that the high school culture was responsible, a culture

186
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:06,480
that many people are only really guilty of being complicit, with a few exceptions. Because some of

187
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,960
the individuals in the tapes don't necessarily do anything drastically terrible, however as a

188
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:15,920
recipient of the worst of high school culture, Hannah Baker should have been aware that naming

189
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,120
people directly in a tape linked to her suicide could really negatively impact their lives if

190
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,360
these tapes were released. The whole point was that high school students were creating social

191
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,640
hierarchies off surface level judgements, what would make any of the people on the tapes above

192
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,160
that scrutiny, some of whom clearly didn't deserve it.

193
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,720
Characterisation is another point that many people feel wasn't covered well enough in the series,

194
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,800
and that's an important factor considering that the show makes the assertion of starting a

195
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,120
discussion around mental wellbeing. For me, it's a mixed bag, there are some really good

196
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,120
interactions that would reflect someone going through those stages of suffering, and obviously

197
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,360
there needs to be some conflict, that's how plots are created, but there are multiple points where

198
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,560
the high school seems ridiculously over the top. There's at least one scene where all the students

199
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,960
just take their phones out at once and start smirking at the same time, talking amongst each

200
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,840
other, and it's so contrived. Often they try to make Hannah out to be at the mercy of the whole

201
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:26,560
damn school, I think this was because they wanted to frame it as her having nowhere to go eventually,

202
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:31,200
but you really didn't need to do that to generate that feeling. Once again, if they could frame the

203
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,840
paranoia that such rumours create, rather than pretending that paranoia is only the reality,

204
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,560
then they would kill two birds with one stone, they'd accurately represent the flawed state of

205
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,960
mind that that mentality creates, and they'd accurately portray the high school environment,

206
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,760
rather than merging the two and presenting that perception as truth, something that would serve

207
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,360
to perpetuate the idea that this scenario is much worse than it actually is. It panders to negative

208
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,960
stereotypes that suicidal audiences are most prone to believing, and presents it as verity.

209
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,600
As a show that wants to connect with a more vulnerable audience, that sort of outlook seems

210
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:14,560
rather inappropriate. As 13 Reasons Why goes, it presents itself as a discourse on accountability

211
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:19,200
and responsibility. We observe a group of students come to terms with their participation in a toxic

212
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,680
culture, this narrative could have worked if it was presented through the eyes of a neutral party,

213
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,320
or no party at all, but the problem is that we have the added detail that the narrative is

214
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,200
presented by the victim themselves. This was clearly to add height and conflict, and more

215
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,840
intimacy, but in doing that, while combining it with the motivation to create a fully accurate

216
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,160
portrayal, they succeed in making Hannah the perfect victim. The problem is that because

217
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,400
the narrative is post-mortem, it is presented without challenge, and we never really learn

218
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,200
much about Hannah or her imperfections, even when she might behave in a way that seems irrational,

219
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,160
it's never subject to much scrutiny, because the narrative just continues. The only real dispute

220
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,880
comes regarding whether she's lying, and we all know how well that plotline is pursued.

221
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,360
In an attempt to keep the narrative as rational and coherent as possible, it undermines the fact

222
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,680
that many suicide victims have mental health problems and other factors that will influence

223
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,640
a person's mental state to drive them to that position. It goes too far to rationalise the

224
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,080
situation, even if it notes that it is not a good option. It makes the act seem very calculated,

225
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,560
which is what leads people to this revenge narrative. I don't think the premise necessarily

226
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,760
comes across as vengeful, but it's very easy to look at that delivery and see it as just that,

227
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,320
a really good example is in the final episode, where the flashback takes us to the school

228
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,160
counsellor's office regarding a sexual assault case, which honestly is something we'll get to

229
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,840
very soon, but in this instance, the counsellor isn't empathetic enough.

230
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,040
It happened, Hannah, and I believe you, but if you won't confront him,

231
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:55,920
then the only other choice is to move on. Yeah, that's just what I'm gonna have to do.

232
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,480
But the flashback also goes the distance to make sure it is very clear that no one is blatantly

233
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,480
in the wrong, but afterwards, Clay's narrative cuts through implying that the counsellor should

234
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,720
have pursued her after she gave him the impression that she didn't want to talk, a very strong

235
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,200
impression, I must add. There could have been legitimate discussion at that point for what

236
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,360
more can and can't be done sometimes, but they just kind of leave the point unchallenged,

237
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,880
ending on this romanticised final, who really cares speech. People did care, and I think

238
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,680
setting the bar that high justifies an unfair expectation from many people, and undermines

239
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,800
their own humanity in a way, and what they may be going through as well.

240
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,960
I think I made myself very clear that no one's coming forward to stop me.

241
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:43,200
Some of you cared, none of you cared enough, and neither did I, and I'm sorry.

242
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,400
And I understand, I guess, what they were trying to do with the idea that everyone has a perspective,

243
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,640
it is a running theme, but the problem is that vulnerable individuals looking to adopt Hannah's

244
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,040
perspective would find it rather easy to do so because the narrative isn't presented as flawed

245
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,200
enough. The show starts a discussion, but one of the points of view implied by the narrative

246
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,960
dictates that an individual can be justified in taking their own life on the basis of circumstances

247
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,440
assumed, which is something that I and a lot of people don't agree with. There's been a lot of

248
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,480
controversy surrounding the increased rates of suicide following the show, it's hard to prove

249
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,640
anything with post-hoc measurement, and it's not an environment that would be ethically viable to

250
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,680
manipulate, so cause and effect can never really be established. It's also impossible to measure

251
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,000
how many lives the show may have saved, so I do take this perspective with a grain of salt,

252
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,200
but typically the concern from many individuals is that such a suicide depicted and published

253
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,000
can provoke copycat incidents. Ironically, a copycat incident is depicted on the show

254
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,480
when one of the characters, Alex, tries to shoot himself following this ongoing conflict.

255
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,160
There are researchers who posit that it may well be the famous suicide scene that causes this,

256
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,640
but I think it's more likely to just be the general theme of the show. You don't want to give

257
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:03,040
people any reasons why, let alone 13, not unopposed at least, and the challenges against these reasons

258
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,440
just come across as a bit lackluster. Now, the scene itself is controversial in other ways,

259
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,080
in fact it's so controversial that Netflix removed it altogether, bit late for that, but I've seen

260
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,560
many people praise it for its rawness, and as a scene that feels important to the storyline,

261
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:22,000
a convergence of the narratives, and I'll say it, it is powerful. However, at the same time,

262
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,840
those scenes aren't gonna be the ones that start discussions, they're gonna be the ones

263
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,320
to provoke emotional reactions, and although artistically it might feel like the right thing

264
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,760
to do, socially I can see why a lot of people took issue with it. I don't know if the crew

265
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,280
behind 13 Reasons Why anticipated that their audience were gonna be as sensitive as they were,

266
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,840
from what I understand, a lot of disclaimers have been placed in post-release, and I guess it would

267
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,400
have been hard to completely ascertain that, but if they wanted to start a discussion, they should

268
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,480
have been more considerate of the boundaries of that discussion, particularly when they appear to

269
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,720
be trying to connect with that audience. I have a feeling that the whole discussion narrative

270
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,360
was conjured up when they realised that they had some pretty severe incoming criticism,

271
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,240
maybe that's just my more cynical side talking. Another prominent couple of sensitive scenes that

272
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,960
are shown include two sexual assault scenes, one of which where the main protagonist is a victim,

273
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,160
one where she is witness. Both of these are perpetuated by Bryce, the main antagonist,

274
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,560
and probably one of the better written characters. He definitely captures the very two-sided nature

275
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,440
that a charismatic jock can portray, while still operating his power in very malicious ways.

276
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:33,040
These scenes will be upsetting to some, and that's important to note, and I do leave that disclaimer here.

277
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:39,200
I ragged on it a lot, but I actually don't dislike season one for what it was, I dislike season one

278
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,840
for what it claims to be. Generally, there's a lot that I liked in the show too, a lot of nice moments

279
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,240
which challenged perception. As said, any scene with the mother was genuinely riveting for me,

280
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,880
and Dylan Minnette does a pretty good job too, conveying a confused friend who doesn't know what

281
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:59,440
to do. As a show, I was entertained, I was taken in, but there is a clear narrative, a clear voice that

282
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,760
the show expects us to listen to, and without awareness, this can lead to shortfalls in the

283
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,640
representation of the realistic worldview that the show attempts to convey, and could help people

284
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,000
easily rationalise otherwise irrational actions that only make sense in the universe for the

285
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,480
writers of 13 Reasons Why Construct, playing into paranoia and mental clarity. This polarises the

286
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,600
debate, and makes Hannah seem like a vengeful psychopath to some, and like a martyr to others.

287
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,080
Neither are true, and yet the show seems to retreat from the idea of nuance and excusing

288
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,200
various shortfalls as inspiration for discourse, and that is the failure of season one.

289
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,520
However, I will say that there are some good discussions where it touches on the ambiguities,

290
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,600
there's this really good conversation between Clay and the school counsellor towards the end.

291
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,120
Clay- Just to imagine what Hannah's last days were.

292
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,960
Try to understand what led her there.

293
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,440
I cost a girl her life because I was afraid to love her.

294
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,440
You can't love someone back to life.

295
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,680
You can try.

296
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:11,120
And there are a few of these strong interactions that I do genuinely respect. Generally, I prefer

297
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,080
a Clay's journey than Hannah's, and I think not having Hannah's narrative spelling it out may have

298
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,440
created a better show, but there are only 13 tapes, and season two was around the corner. There was a

299
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,440
There was a lot they could change and improve on, were they?

300
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,640
No.

301
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,680
The source material for 13 reasons why the teen novel was all used for the first series.

302
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,080
This meant the creators had fewer boundaries holding them back, and combining them to perhaps

303
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,720
the trappings and shortfalls of such a premise. Would they squander this newfound freedom?

304
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,960
The answer is an affirmative yes, and its failure, I'd argue, is even worse.

305
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,040
By this point, they must have had the memo that they were starting a discussion, so their

306
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:13,920
contribution would at least be valued on those merits as well. Series 2 takes place with the

307
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,960
arch of the ongoing court battle between Hannah's mother and the school, whom she wishes to hold

308
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,320
accountable for her daughter's death. This time, each episode is based on the testimony of someone

309
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,560
related to Hannah, most of these individuals having been addressed on the tapes themselves.

310
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,560
It was a nifty little concept on paper, one of the biggest problems that immediately yielded

311
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:37,040
was that there was not nearly enough they could say, not as much as they would need to at least.

312
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,480
In 13 reasons why season 2, they repeat a lot of the trials and tribulations that the characters

313
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,040
in season 1 went through, leading to frustration at points. For example, the main protagonist,

314
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,280
Clay, has significant issues opening up. The arch of the first season provides the feeling

315
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:56,160
that it's good and healthy to open up sometimes a nice message, and holding these problems in

316
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,800
only leads to greater complications. In the second season, this problem repeats itself again,

317
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,320
which leads to similar discussions.

318
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:24,800
Now it's not out of the ordinary for someone's personal issues to resurface, however,

319
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,040
the feeling of relapse occurring was pretty depressing and frustrating for me to watch

320
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,520
personally. Clay repeats a lot of conflicts, and it becomes tiresome, it didn't really have much

321
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:39,760
to add within the themes during the season, so what did it add? Melodrama. A ton of melodrama,

322
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,600
there were people being beaten up, there were guns, there were knives, and at this point,

323
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,280
I felt I should be more annoyed, but at least they were making it obvious they were happy to

324
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:52,000
betray this narrative that this was a quote realistic high school environment, and I stress,

325
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
there probably are some high school environments that are rife with weapons, safety hazards,

326
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,640
and various other issues that shouldn't be ignored. However, the problem is, it doesn't work

327
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,640
for the premise, the brutality of certain high schools in America is reflected in various

328
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,000
socio-economic conditions that need to be in place in such a narrative too. There's no normalization

329
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,960
of violence in high school for 13 reasons why, particularly in the first season, it is treated

330
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,600
with the shock and horror, yet it happens on such a regular basis that you can't help but see it as

331
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,840
anything but forced conflict. Once again, to add weight to my point of rehearsed storylines,

332
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,160
the main cause of all this conflict is the fear that those who testify will incriminate some of

333
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,960
the worst individuals involved, which leads to various scares and sabotages, and the rest.

334
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:38,640
Because the thing is, in high school, everyone's watching you all the time.

335
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,640
You have to be careful.

336
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:48,320
Now the high school represented in 13 reasons why was never the most realistic, but it could isolate

337
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,000
the struggles that these students were going through, and at least allow you to connect with

338
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,080
them. That's not something that's really identifiable in the second season, there are some

339
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,160
things that have happened between the end of the first and the start of the second season that I

340
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,160
personally didn't like. Clay is now in a relationship with a character who was previously

341
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:09,040
not involved at all in the storyline, and therefore I just felt awkward watching it as I couldn't see

342
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,680
the chemistry develop. It was done for the purpose of creating a conflict that Clay keeps comparing

343
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,840
other females with Hannah, but it seems forced, and any interactions that arise from it are

344
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,000
extremely uncomfortable to sit through, because I could never really accept the premise that

345
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,280
these two people were a thing.

346
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:38,480
This relationship ends pretty quickly when she's taken away to a mental facility, but it underlines

347
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,800
another huge problem, which is just how easily people are emotionally provoked into hostile

348
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:47,520
confrontation. One of the characters who finds himself in confrontation is Mr Porter, whose

349
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,040
mild mannered counselling suddenly turns into high school vigilantism.

350
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,720
And although you could argue it's the mindset of someone who has nothing left to lose,

351
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,280
that sort of behaviour could completely compromise your testimony in court, and leads to nothing

352
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:25,120
being achieved other than another angry black man trope box ticked. I understand it's an emotional

353
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:30,320
time for people, but multiple people just seem so angry, entitled, and petulant. Probably the

354
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,200
worst example of this is the now recovering Alex, who following his failed suicide attempt will

355
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,480
just have the spontaneous outbursts out of nowhere. Now on one hand, I empathise with his trauma,

356
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,160
he has this memory loss, which actually isn't scientifically possible, but they're a bigger

357
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:48,880
fish to fry. His movement is impaired on one side of his body, and he's clearly suffering.

358
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,680
Because the writers use his outburst to make him seem antagonistic rather than tortured,

359
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,840
you end up feeling rather bitter towards him.

360
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:17,440
Often his eruptions are spontaneous, and they spend much more time focusing on his

361
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,840
emotional reactions rather than any discussion about what he might be going through. It doesn't

362
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,240
mean that those conversations don't exist, they are covered, but you don't really need more than

363
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,040
one of these angry moments to convey what he's experiencing. By the second and third time,

364
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:36,720
it feels awkward to watch, and so painful for the sake of confrontation. I don't think it does the

365
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,600
suffering of such conditions any justice, but with that said, he's far from the individual

366
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,640
who's suffering the worst treatment of their mental health here. I think that award goes to Clay Jensen.

367
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,800
As I said earlier, the tapes are over, you can't rewrite what was recorded, and it'd be hard to

368
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:02,080
revive the character of Hannah Baker now that she is deceased. I guess what I should say is that it'd

369
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:08,160
be hard to revive the character of Hannah Baker in a decent, respectful way, because they revive her,

370
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:13,920
but my god. In the first season, Clay has visions of Hannah here and there, and you know seeing her

371
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,720
face in other people and so on was understandable, given that he was clearly shaken by the ordeal.

372
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,520
However, by the second season, she begins to talk and have full on conversations with Clay.

373
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,920
On concept, this could represent an internal monologue between a person who is rather torn on

374
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,680
the right thing to do, but the writers make it very clear that they do not want it to be

375
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,040
interpreted that way.

376
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,160
So this left me with two options, either Hannah has come back as a ghost, or Clay Jensen's visions of

377
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,640
Hannah now talk to him. Neither of these options are particularly desirable to me, but given the

378
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,640
fact that ghosts would not be thematically congruent with the outlook the show is going for,

379
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,680
and mental health seems to be the focus, I'm going to take a guess and say it is the fact that Clay's

380
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:17,280
visions are worsening. This could also be proven due to the fact that Hannah often cannot answer

381
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,760
Clay's questions, even when the answer seems simple, thus suggesting she is a manifestation

382
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,840
of his own limited perception, while also providing more frustrating conversation.

383
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:51,600
Clay may be able to allege that this is a sign of schizophrenia in Clay, or something similar,

384
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,240
and I'd have to agree, and yet throughout the whole series, Clay just continues to live with this

385
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,960
apparition of Hannah, having continuous conversations, the writers acting as if it's just

386
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,680
nothing, as if he's just going along, it even escalates in exactly this way towards the end.

387
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,600
Clay's vision of Hannah becomes worse, probably drawn from the frustration that they have been

388
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,800
unable to obtain justice for the girls that Bryce has sexually assaulted. This vision of Hannah then

389
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:24,720
begins to repeat Bryce's take, the one which Hannah talks about her experience, and this causes him to

390
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:30,960
go to Bryce's house with the intent to shoot him, before turning the gun on himself. At this point,

391
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,280
the point should be, this is bad, and Clay needs help, and yet he's just escorted home,

392
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,840
and nothing, nothing at all is done about it, and okay, it can be difficult when we're suffering

393
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:44,240
from these illnesses to open up about them, but throughout the series, this apparition is presented

394
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,040
so passively that it never feels like the writers are even challenging you to think about it in that

395
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,440
way, other than the scene where she's literally screaming at him, she might as well be one of the

396
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,480
families, but okay, maybe I'd be a bit more forgiving if this is given an arc, and he confronts

397
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,920
this vision, or at least there's some closure, but it's so unbelievably insulting that it annoys me

398
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,720
just to speak about it. In the final episode of the series, they have Hannah's funeral,

399
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,520
Clay says a eulogy, it's a good eulogy for what it's worth, but at the end, we just see Hannah's

400
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,880
spirit exiting, as if that's the closure we deserve to such a tortured arc. The vision's now gone,

401
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,320
we can all be happy, hooray, and in a sense, that sort of closure worked with how they presented

402
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,040
her, but she shouldn't have been presented in that way, with so little awareness to what she

403
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,600
represented in Clay's mind. If you're not distracted by how poorly Hannah is written,

404
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:39,040
you're pissed off that this is a concept they thought was just asceptible to present as this

405
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,840
thing. This was a problem, and I don't think it should be downplayed. Another person whose

406
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:49,600
mentality is just completely butchered is Tyler, now Tyler being the creep who photographed Hannah,

407
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:54,480
is pretty much ostracised from many of the main characters, and this isolation can be dangerous.

408
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,480
They definitely set the grounds for him as a volatile character, and in this season,

409
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,680
he finds belonging with individuals who like him are social outcasts, he partakes in various

410
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:08,640
rebellious behaviours which detail him attacking the social hierarchy in the school through

411
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,000
vandalism and the rest. Now this quickly goes downhill, as he doesn't really understand how

412
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,480
to fit in properly, and mistakes edge for cruelty, and eventually falls out of place with those

413
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,200
friends too. Now I could talk about how clumsily that is handled, and how his actions don't really

414
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,160
make sense, but let's give him the benefit of the doubt on that basis and say, ok, he is socially

415
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:37,200
awkward, they don't have to make sense. So after being distanced from this group, he posts

416
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,920
incriminating photos detailing his involvement in the vandalism of school premises, he is

417
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,440
reprimanded by the headmaster, and disciplined accordingly, or at least how they feel is accordingly.

418
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,560
Now up to a point, I could see how someone's isolation leading to apathy could drive destructive

419
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,960
thoughts, and it's even shown subtly in some scenes, such as the one where he shoots a crow,

420
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,560
and has an interesting reaction.

421
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:27,040
For those who are unaware, Tyler is meant to be the school

422
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,680
shooter kid, and in certain episodes, they're trying to outline his sensitivity to the possible

423
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,400
radicalisation that such environments might produce. It's a hard line to walk, because as

424
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,320
always, you don't want to make the school shooter narrative seem too rational, you need to portray

425
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,800
him as an outlier, but you have to make it real. However, probably high off the backlash they

426
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,880
received for making it too rational in the first series, the writers go in totally the opposite

427
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,440
direction, and make his turn seem prompted by a scene that I'm going to have to describe.

428
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,480
Part of his discipline for the vandalism incurred him going on a correctional course,

429
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,680
he goes away for a certain amount of time, and seems to come back as a changed man. However,

430
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,080
on the first day back, a character known as Monty, who is known for being aggressive,

431
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:14,080
violently attacks him with his goons in the toilet, before ramming a mop stick up his anus,

432
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:19,040
and this upsets him so much that by the evening he's just off to shoot up the school dance.

433
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,160
The scene upset me a lot, to be fair, mainly because I felt it was unnecessary. Not only

434
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,080
do they really fail to document the gradual descent that many people in these scenarios

435
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:33,520
go through, but they have to include a really ham-fisted scene that was basically used as

436
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:44,720
a vehicle to justify why he did what he did, and the misrepresentation doesn't stop there.

437
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:58,720
Now, although it was a great misrepresentation, it was the perfect representation for what the

438
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,360
show had become, a show that viewed sensitive issues as a pit stop rather than a natural

439
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:08,720
source of discussion. It felt lazy, it felt exploitive, and it doesn't seem to understand

440
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,520
how to initiate that conversation it seems to care about. Giving someone basic information,

441
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,800
or just showing them a really sensitive scene isn't enough to start a conversation. If I tell

442
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,200
someone that the square root of 64 is 8 and then ask them to solve the hodge conjecture,

443
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,120
it doesn't mean I've sufficiently informed or equipped them to have that discussion.

444
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,200
These scenes are the sort of thing that will shock someone, and not necessarily give them

445
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,120
much to say, I don't know how I was meant to respond to that scene. The scenes just

446
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:39,600
discussed were the huge standouts for obvious reasons, and it's completely understandable,

447
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:44,080
they were done for the sole purpose of shock value. With the first season's suicide scene,

448
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,760
you could at least make the argument from an artistic perspective it had been built up

449
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,400
appropriately. With this said, in season 2, there were plenty of other scenes that were now added

450
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,040
in to embellish the timeline which just felt frankly inappropriate. Most of these scenes

451
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,280
were around the basis of Hannah, as shown by various testimonials. In the first season,

452
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,440
the tapes were presented as a nearly wholly accurate representation of the environment

453
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,920
that Hannah was subjected to. The second season uses flashbacks to add various details,

454
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,880
which I suppose were meant to be twists, but all they did was throw into contention a lot

455
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,080
of testimonials in her first season. One of the worst examples of this is Zack. In the first

456
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,800
season, Hannah puts him on his tape for fairly minor reasons, but ultimately he was there for

457
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,200
the loneliness that he represented and caused her to feel through his own actions. However,

458
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,280
the second season creates this whole subplot where they were actually having some sort of

459
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,720
relationship which renders a lot of the original narrative for the first season presented pointless.

460
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,320
Also, quick side note, they say this about 2001 A Space Odyssey.

461
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,920
I don't know exactly what they were trying to say here, but don't. Just don't. The second season

462
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,680
felt like they were trying to fix the errors of the first season, but ultimately just ended up

463
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,920
creating more errors themselves, without the source material they tried to grip onto characters

464
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,560
who honestly didn't clearly have much else to them, so the writers just made them angrier,

465
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:22,160
more volatile, leading to more conflicts. But also them just creating these new situations

466
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,080
like they did with Zack, where individual testimonies reveal new information.

467
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:38,400
I assume they anticipated this, and tried to deflect it in the script here, but this is no

468
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,200
valid response. It's not about Hannah including everything about a person, it's about including

469
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,600
the relevant arguments for why a person led Hannah to take her own life, and this story paints Zack

470
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:52,080
like a completely different person to the one portrayed in the first season, and makes Hannah's

471
00:41:52,080 --> 00:42:05,120
take basically redundant. Another one who does that is Bryce. They make it seem like she actually

472
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:10,000
had something with him, before revealing that she actually didn't, but she still spent some time

473
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,240
with him, so I guess it was meant to show that she actually isn't lying, but the fact that she

474
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:19,040
admitted certain details like these in her takes regardless wasn't a good look, it kind of ruins

475
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:24,480
the first season for me. It's like the prequel film that no one wanted, it's like Shrek 3 but

476
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,200
Prince Charming just keeps having flashbacks to Shrek 2. Don't try and fill in the gaps with

477
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,720
Shyamalan style twists, it's daft and unrealistic and only serves to sacrifice the character that

478
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:40,000
you presented in the first season. Speaking of character assassinations, in episode 10 there is

479
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,640
this character that I think everyone has forgotten, but I have not, because I was actually really

480
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,840
annoyed about it. This is Sarah, she is introduced at the end of episode 9, and is thrown in literally

481
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:55,040
the episode after as someone who has been a victim of Hannah's bullying at a previous school.

482
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,760
This character has no other introduction, and once again is used as a source for unnecessary

483
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,080
conflict, however arguably the most insulting element to her inclusion is that logically

484
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:18,960
speaking she wouldn't serve the purpose that the writers intended her to. Basically, she's there

485
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:24,880
to undermine Hannah's credibility as a victim, to accuse her of being a bully at a different school,

486
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,200
after all, if she was a bully at a different school, how could she be a victim at this one?

487
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:34,080
This may work if her credibility was actually on the chopping board, but there are already numerous

488
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:39,600
testimonies that say she was unfairly treated, even from people who misrepresented and attacked her.

489
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:49,840
It's important to remember that the question was whether the school had failed to protect her,

490
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:54,160
which was the point of the lawsuit, and if the prosecution lawyer had been more diligent,

491
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:59,600
he could have easily flipped this to say that the school in that district, this other story of Sarah,

492
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:05,440
also failed to protect this individual against high school bullying and harassment. This whole

493
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:11,520
conflict changes nothing and only serves to fill out the 13 episode runtime, it was a stupid

494
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,240
diversion whose themes were never really explored regardless. I guess the point of the courtroom

495
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:21,040
was to try and illuminate how unjust many court decisions are, but their route of doing it was

496
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:26,480
to write out the school's attorney as antagonistically as possible and then have the decision

497
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,880
come out in their favour.

498
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,280
And isn't it true that your vandalism

499
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,240
caused thousands of dollars of damage to Zach Dempsey's car?

500
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,760
I was angry at him. I paid for the damage.

501
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,160
What did you do when you were angry at Courtney Crimson?

502
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,000
I just took her to Hannah's grave.

503
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,840
Are you responsible for Hannah's death?

504
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:48,040
Yes. There are kids who did a lot worse, kids who you let skate,

505
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,000
who did things that you won't even talk about, and adults at liberty-

506
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,160
Request to strike that answer as non-responsive.

507
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,120
So ordered.

508
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:59,880
Now I'm not saying that attorneys can't be this way, but it's simplistic and two dimensional.

509
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,880
At one point, Clay's mother was going to be the attorney representing the school, and although

510
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:08,280
I understand why her character would pull out due to the vested interest, it would have been

511
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:13,400
more interesting to see her battle with her own principals and her client's interests while still

512
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:18,040
trying to understand who's responsible. Instead, we have this very vindictive character who we're

513
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:24,040
basically told not to like. It's okay to challenge your audience sometimes, you know, the whole arc

514
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,600
of season 2 is utilised to tell the audience that we're meant to root for the school to lose,

515
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,040
and when they don't, we're meant to lament the injustice of the system.

516
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:36,360
But honestly, I'm not so sure about that. Let me elaborate.

517
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,760
As I understand, the court case is meant to indict the school as culpable in Hannah's suicide.

518
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:57,000
Now in the first season, this discussion and responsibility is kind of juggled between parties,

519
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
and the school environment is definitely brought up, and for what it's worth, there actually is

520
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,920
a discussion to be had. Hannah's parents are initiating the lawsuit against the school,

521
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,720
but it's also framed as an emotional decision and one done from people in exceptional grief,

522
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,840
trying to find a reason for why their daughter took her own life.

523
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:41,720
The school is presented as clumsy, shallow, and occasionally irresponsible, but never is it really

524
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:46,920
implied that the school had to pay for what they had done. It was a barrage of conflicting feelings

525
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,960
with no clear answer. In the second season, the show pulls out all the stops to make sure the

526
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,520
school is shown in the worst light possible artistically, while circumstantially trying

527
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:01,320
to present the situation as completely unjust, so there are fights, threats, and so on,

528
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:05,880
yet barely any of this is mentioned in court that could actually incriminate the school environment.

529
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,720
In fact, I believe the only person who does openly mention it is Jessica Davis.

530
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:29,960
If everything that happened in the school was reported in court, you might have a more

531
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:34,360
watertight case, but nothing really is reported, and we're meant to be angry when the court comes

532
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:39,160
to a decision that the school is not culpable, and after a while, I just reflected and felt that the

533
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,960
decision was completely reasonable. The first series asked questions about responsibility,

534
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:48,840
and the second series was just like, yep, that was the school. It doesn't help that honestly,

535
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:53,320
a lot of the questions from both the school and family attorneys were about individual

536
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:57,240
involvement, implying that this individual behaviour was accountable to the school.

537
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,640
Now of course, only one side was arguing this, but it essentially became an argument of tone

538
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:06,760
policing, the school was such massive pricks, like the principal for example, he's a big ol' prick.

539
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:12,280
The most dangerous thing would be to believe somehow that Hannah's suicide

540
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:19,880
is more than a tragic death. She's not a hero, she does not have lessons to teach us,

541
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:27,160
and we need to recognise the sad and simple truth that she is dead and gone forever.

542
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:31,480
These guys are so bad that we're meant to side with the good guys, but that's the thing,

543
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,800
it's one thing being right on the foundations of morals, but it's different when you're trying to

544
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:40,280
carry out a legal prosecution that implies there should be reimbursements, and implying that the

545
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:45,320
school didn't do its legal duty. It's a problem, and the question of how paternalistic schools

546
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:50,840
should be is complex, because taking matters into your own hands comes with its own consequences.

547
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:55,320
One might ask how involved parents should be in certain matters, and it was hard to prove how much

548
00:48:55,320 --> 00:49:00,280
the school knew while doing nothing. In fact, in the first season, one of the most incriminating

549
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:05,320
factors such as the inscriptions inside the toilet cubicles was treated with shock, implying that

550
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,600
there was little knowledge, or at least little provable knowledge.

551
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,600
How have we never seen this before?

552
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:16,360
Oh, well, faculty is not supposed to be in a student's restroom, you know, in college and

553
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,160
tutorial staff to see if they could repaint these walls.

554
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:24,360
I don't like to side with the big bad institution, everyone knows how anti-establishment I am,

555
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:29,800
and make no mistake, as they are written to be, they are not good people, but being not good

556
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:34,920
people doesn't mean that you should lose a court case. I hate to sound nostalgic, but once again,

557
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:39,160
in the first scene, there's this really sharp conversation between Hannah's mother and Clay's

558
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:43,080
mother, who at the time was representing the school. I thought they'd make it some

559
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:47,240
moment to morally signal, but they completely subverted my expectations.

560
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:52,840
Would you settle for, say, $200,000?

561
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:57,560
I think I would only settle for the truth, whether I liked it or not.

562
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:01,320
That's the sort of thing that they were just not interested in doing in the second series.

563
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:06,200
In the first series, they tried too hard to make certain positions too justified, but in this one,

564
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:11,640
they just tried too hard to say, no, this is what we meant, and I like it less, and if they did it

565
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:16,200
with more attention to mental health, I'd probably be less likely to criticise them, at least it'd

566
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:20,280
be a bit more socially conscientious, but as mentioned earlier, they missed the mark on that

567
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:26,280
as well. It's the good guys, bad guys, TV drama trying to pass as a serious look on mental health,

568
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:31,240
and its mental health coverage is just bad. However, if we are to ignore the ridiculously

569
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:36,600
dramatic ending of the attempted school shooting, one moment that does manage to capture a bit more

570
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:42,440
realism is the sexual assault situation regarding Bryce, and how hard it is for many individuals to

571
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:47,240
come forward, particularly given their perception that someone like Bryce has due to his wealth and

572
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,440
prestigious family.

573
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:07,080
Throughout the series, he's presented as someone under pressure, but also very calculated in his

574
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:11,720
method to protect his reputation. He's an awful person who has raped multiple individuals, and yet

575
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:16,840
even when his victims go to the police, he only receives a minor sentence of three months probation,

576
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,920
and his former friend Justin, who is from a significantly less privileged background, ends up

577
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:25,560
receiving a six month sentence, despite the fact that his worst crime was being too intoxicated to

578
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:30,040
fully understand what Bryce was doing, and not being persistent enough. This was a somewhat

579
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:34,520
decent narrative on the failings of the legal system, and how it often comes out in favour of

580
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:38,840
those more privileged. There's also a good narrative about loyalty and the price of quote

581
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:43,320
betrayal, I would have much preferred them to focus on that rather than the prosecution of the school,

582
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:48,120
however I guess that wouldn't fill enough episodes. I think the one scene that I'd use to summarise the

583
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:53,880
tone of 13 reasons why season 2 is an alternative flashback scene for Mr Porter the school counsellor,

584
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:58,680
in all fairness, it's not a bad scene, in this reality he chases after Hannah as she leaves and

585
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:04,200
helps her open up, I kinda like it, but the context of it existing seems to be basically the writers

586
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:09,320
feeling insecure of how people may have interpreted that scene from last season, either defending Mr

587
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,680
Porter or attacking him.

588
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:34,200
If that scene had been the first season, I probably would have liked it a lot more, as it would have felt

589
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:39,880
more ambiguous. If season 1 says here's what you could think, season 2 says here's what you should

590
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:45,400
think, and I have to admit, I dislike the latter more on principle, there's nothing wrong with trying to

591
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:50,600
reel in the suicide is justifiable narrative, but they also go after a lot of other narratives too,

592
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:56,040
which to be honest, weren't necessarily inherently evil points of view, and compromise many of the

593
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:00,840
not so bad elements of season 1. They are scrambling to appease their complaints, but don't have a grip

594
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:06,600
on how to do it. Season 2 swaps out discourse for drama, and waters down any substantial elements

595
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:11,960
that may have given it its appeal in the first place, it is not mental health oriented, and commodifies

596
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:18,360
a high majority of those topics, that is the failure of season 2. But hey, we could talk about season 3,

597
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,000
they still have time to redeem themselves, so would they?

598
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:21,500
No.

599
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,080
Well thank you for that contribution, but I have a-

600
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:27,640
No, you've spoken enough now, we're like 5 hours in and you haven't even reached season 3.

601
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,480
I mean, that's what I was about to get into.

602
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:35,400
Yeah, well, I'm here now and it's my video, so we can't all be twats with too much free time, can we?

603
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,640
Now piss off and let me talk about this garbage fire.

604
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,600
The show is declining in quality so rapidly, I'm genuinely curious as to how and where it could

605
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:52,600
possibly go next. If nothing else, season 3 proves that there really is no rhyme or reason as to why

606
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:58,280
any of this story is unfolding, aside from the fact that it is recognizable, popular, and probably

607
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:04,840
boosts Netflix subscriptions. As if the fact that a show called 13 Reasons Why is already 39

608
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:10,360
episodes long wasn't comical enough. We're dealing with the aftermath of an event so distant at this

609
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:15,800
point that it's very difficult to justify why any of this is truly necessary, aside from the pure,

610
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:22,680
juicy drama of it all. Season 3 shifts gears in such a way that would be fine if it wasn't treated

611
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:27,240
like it's doing us some kind of virtuous service, as if this show is anything more than the

612
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:32,840
melodramatic high school drama aimed at young teenagers that it indeed is. In all honesty,

613
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:37,400
I kind of enjoy my yearly dose of this series due to the absurd levels they have to stretch

614
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:42,200
in order to keep this angsty snowball rolling. At the very least, I find it to be somewhat

615
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:47,240
comically entertaining as a trashy drama aimed at young adults, but I'm not sure that's the

616
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:56,200
kind of feedback the creators were hoping for. Okay then, if season 1 is about what led to the

617
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:01,720
end of Hannah Baker and season 2 is about the court case that preceded, then season 3 is simply

618
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:06,920
a whodunit murder mystery, with the hook or central question of the season being who killed...

619
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:13,320
All of the marketing was brandished with the question of who was responsible. Who did it?

620
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:22,600
Who killed Bryce? At this point in the show though, we're very aware of how evil Bryce

621
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:27,320
Walker is. He's so comically maniacal over the first two seasons that it's obvious he

622
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:32,840
was set up and marked as the major antagonist, and his comeuppance is the only narrative beat

623
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:37,400
that has any consequence besides the more pedantic pieces of drama that fill out the

624
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:44,680
minute-to-minute of the show. In order for this season to come together, the writers decided that

625
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:50,120
for this story to have any weight behind it, Bryce needed to come across as being more complicated and

626
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:59,000
well-rounded. So you felt more conflicted over his demise. Problem is, you ideally should have

627
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,240
been sowing those seeds since the beginning to avoid it coming across as retroactive and

628
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:07,400
kind of cheap. For a show that typically seems to have dealt in pretty clear absolutes,

629
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,720
it's very strange to me that three seasons in is when they suddenly feel inspired to add a

630
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:15,080
bit of grayness to the intentions of their more controversial characters.

631
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:24,600
Reminds me of the tropey writing something like The Walking Dead often falls into,

632
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:28,680
where a minor character suddenly gets an intense backstory that fleshes them out

633
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:32,280
mere moments before they're killed, so their death appears to have more impact.

634
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,400
With the way the show has been structured and written, it seems obvious to me that

635
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:39,720
everything after the original material has been composed backwards. They seem to have a

636
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:44,920
pre-prepared list of dramatic and controversial ideas that fit in line with what made the original

637
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:51,000
book so famous, or infamous, depending on who you ask, and instead of writing realistic people

638
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,680
that progress in a relatable and honest approach, they appear to force the square peg into a round

639
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:02,280
hole to continue to double down on this idea that 13 Reasons Why is on the cutting edge of

640
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,120
socio-political commentary.

641
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:08,840
I think it's mature and responsible storytelling on the part of Brian Yorkie and the writers.

642
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:11,880
I mean, to- to- it's courageous, too.

643
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,920
So how do they attempt to make you feel sympathy for a violent,

644
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:20,360
serial abuser fiend? Well, their answer was to hammer home this idea that at the end of it all,

645
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:25,720
despite the consistent and insistent amount of pure evil he has displayed in front of us,

646
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:29,800
the, come on guys, he's still a person at the end of the day, right?

647
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,440
He's a f***ing person, Clay. A human being.

648
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:37,640
One of the main themes of this season is this idea that parents and or family have a huge role

649
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:42,760
to play in shaping troubled lives. That behind broken or evil people is some kind of underlying

650
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:48,280
trauma, be it a fiercely homophobic father, a distant unloving mother, or whatever it may be,

651
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:52,120
which is an interesting idea to explore. There are a lot of movies I like that deal with these

652
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:57,640
very themes. However, the script here is far too hokey and silly to sell any of it.

653
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,960
Parent entering.

654
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:09,960
Let's not forget that at the start of season three, Bryce is known to us as the guy who

655
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:14,520
started the initial rumors about Hannah, viciously sexually assaulted a minimum of three different

656
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:19,320
people with more implied victims, started more nasty rumors, this time about Jessica,

657
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:24,440
tormented Zack by messing with Hannah's locker, lied while under oath countless times,

658
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:28,520
and probably many more horrendous acts I've forgotten about. Now, I don't know about you,

659
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:33,480
but I don't really think that Bryce could be properly redeemed as a character under any sense,

660
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:38,440
really, with what we've already seen him do. Like, this is very extreme. Like, what he did is

661
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:50,040
abhorrent. This guy is eviler than the fucking emperor. The only possible way I could see it

662
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:55,720
going down was, perhaps, in season three his arc was to come to the realization of what he'd done

663
00:58:55,720 --> 00:59:00,600
and confess the truth to the police and take his punishment like a responsible person. Nah,

664
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:04,920
he wouldn't be forgiven, but that's the only real way I could see you taking this character in a

665
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:10,040
sympathetic direction and still maintaining some modicum of reasonable sense. It's true that

666
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:14,680
suddenly Bryce seems to have some kind of realization in season three about what he's done

667
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:19,240
and why it was bad. I assume they were going for a conflicted character who was fighting against

668
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:23,640
the evil instincts that had defined him for so many years, which we learn seems to originate

669
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:27,400
from a troubled family life growing up with parents that didn't love him properly. The

670
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:32,200
show abuses the idea that if you have a sad backstory, that automatically makes the concept

671
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:37,480
of evil deeds inherently more gray. However, as I already mentioned, it's looking for justification

672
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:41,240
after the fact instead of having some kind of plan for the character from the beginning.

673
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:45,640
Comes across that way anyway. Intentions aside, the execution of this character is where things

674
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:51,720
completely fall apart, all for the sake of this ridiculous murder mystery. Bryce follows through

675
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:56,280
on some of the more dastardly crimes yet in season three. A particular standout moment for

676
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:01,400
me being when he breaks into his dad's mansion to vandalize it, except it's revealed that he

677
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:07,800
went to the wrong house and winds up threatening a small child with a knife, like an actual deranged

678
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:16,200
sociopath. Well, I suppose he's only human.

679
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:22,840
Juxtapose that insanity against the attempts to humanize him and you wind up with some

680
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:27,480
brilliant unintentional comedy, such as when Bryce and his mother finally bond by throwing

681
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:40,360
paint on each other. This is without even mentioning the very intentional and petty

682
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:44,200
physical assault that Bryce commits in the penultimate episode. Story-wise,

683
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:48,040
this is for the character of Zack to have motivation to beat Bryce to a pulp,

684
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:53,080
so he can be a red herring for the real killer. But anyway, Bryce decides to plow his body at

685
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:57,960
full speed into Zack during the chaos of a riot that takes place in the middle of an American

686
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:07,960
football match in episode 12. This is, of course, fueled by pure jealousy because Zack moved in on

687
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:14,280
Bryce's ex-girlfriend, likely ruining any chance of Zack's sporting career permanently. Might as

688
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:19,160
well add a final destroyed life to the pile of chaos that this nasty character has left in his

689
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:30,440
wake. I mean, to be fair, he is only human. If that wasn't enough to prove how terrible this

690
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:35,160
character is, I went to the 13 Reasons Why wiki, which is hilarious by the way, where I noticed

691
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:40,200
some interesting, and pretty poorly written, observations. I find it very curious that for

692
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:46,120
a supposedly grey character, he has a dedicated section on his wiki listed as enemies, where most

693
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:51,720
of his crimes are conveniently listed in relation to the major characters. Oh god, wow, what a

694
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:56,760
horrible person. In the end, Bryce turned out to be a far more complicated character than people

695
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:01,000
first believed him to be. His crimes are inexcusable, but he did try to make up for

696
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:07,480
his crimes and seek some sort of redemption for what he has done. No he didn't. You're talking

697
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:13,400
about the same character who is listed under his personality section as a cruel, arrogant, spoiled,

698
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:19,320
manipulative, violent, and selfish person, and is a very dangerous individual. That sounds like a

699
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:23,560
more accurate description to me. It doesn't matter to me how many times he has a paint fight with his

700
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:29,240
mother, apologises to his victims, has a weird relationship with his dad, has a go at his meanie

701
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:33,880
grandfather, or complains about the world, not allowing him to change.

702
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:41,000
If anything, with the way it's presented, he comes across as a fairly consistent liar,

703
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,160
who is never truly being genuine because as the viewer, we get to see that he really hasn't

704
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:49,800
changed at all. It's even revealed that he's managed to fool multiple therapists.

705
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:59,720
As well as being responsible for having Tony's entire family get deported.

706
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,760
That's most of what bothered me about this character in this season,

707
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:17,560
aside from one important detail I guess. That being his relation to a new member of the cast.

708
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:27,960
Annie, or Lil Annie as I like to call her, is arguably the protagonist of season three,

709
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:32,840
which is a strange decision for multiple reasons. She is essential to the structure of the season,

710
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:38,040
with her narration being framed as a recounting to the police of the full murder mystery story,

711
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:42,520
as you later find out. I don't really understand why it was necessary to add yet another person

712
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:47,400
to this already huge cast, aside from the need to have a vessel that everyone can dump exposition

713
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:52,280
onto and over explain everything, as well as being a new face to have in a love triangle between

714
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:57,080
Clay and Bryce. Yeah, there are so many love triangles it's hard to keep track. Lil Annie is

715
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:01,240
written as an irritating know-it-all, who loves the sound of her own voice and miraculously

716
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:05,960
instantly connects with everyone that she meets, as a weak writing trick designed around shortcutting

717
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,720
the need to have her relationships progress in a more believable manner.

718
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:16,280
She's a blank slate who is used to second guess and constantly question everyone

719
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:18,520
to keep them spouting the awful dialogue.

720
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:28,040
Oh my god, it is bad. She's also got a British accent for some reason,

721
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:32,840
which I hate because I obviously- I hate British people and their stupid accents.

722
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:39,480
She quickly gets dangerously entangled in the entire affair, forming a strange relationship

723
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:46,600
with Bryce and sleeping with him multiple times. It doesn't make her a very likeable character,

724
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:50,440
but at least she knows by the end it was an extremely immoral thing to do.

725
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:56,520
Yes, it was the worst thing you've ever done. She's the most proactive character in terms of

726
01:04:56,520 --> 01:05:00,440
moving the mystery of the plot along, with her motivation being that she wants to find out who

727
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:04,920
murdered Bryce because of her intimate involvement with him. I find it odd that they insisted on her

728
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:10,520
being the lead detective of the story, instead of the literal policeman- sorry, police officer,

729
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:14,920
who has been established, I think since the beginning, multiple seasons. Turns out he's

730
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:20,600
the father of the murderer too, so that would be inherent added drama, but I suppose that would

731
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,760
distract from the high school tween nonsense.

732
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,760
We will get you whatever help you need, Justin.

733
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,560
Oh, spoilers.

734
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:35,800
I decided to lump these characters together for a couple of reasons.

735
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:39,720
First of all, as if one love triangle wasn't enough, they needed to have a pesky little

736
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:43,880
cheating side quest going on in the background, with Jessica juggling a relationship with the

737
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:47,960
two fellas at once to add to the theater of it all. I already spoiled it, but it's revealed

738
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:52,680
that technically Alex is the one who deals the final blow to Bryce, so he gets credit for the

739
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:56,760
kill. It's fine though, because they agree to frame another character I haven't mentioned yet,

740
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,840
Monty. We'll get to him later though.

741
01:05:58,840 --> 01:05:59,960
You're a crazy bitch.

742
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,160
Yeah, and you should fear that.

743
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:10,440
The murder scene is a complete mess because of the shift Bryce goes through depending on

744
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:14,600
what is convenient at the time to the script, but first he tries to make a case that he's

745
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:19,080
trying to change and that the world won't let him, even though he's- he's hasn't really done

746
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:24,040
anything aside from continue to be evil. Even going as far as to have made a confession tape

747
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:28,600
to give to people instead of just telling the police, why would you do that? However,

748
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:34,120
the moment he's helped up by Alex, he says he's going to destroy Zack and break his other knee,

749
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:41,480
which you might justify as him being angry in the heat of the moment. He did get his ass kicked

750
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:47,480
after all. But to me, it comes across as if his true nature is to be a violent maniac,

751
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:53,480
as we've seen for three seasons. Either way, Alex kills him and they cover it up. The characters

752
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:57,800
are covering up murders at this point. The main cast is so morally bankrupt at this point that

753
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:02,280
I'm pretty sure there isn't a single one of them that doesn't belong in jail for the seriousness

754
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:07,480
of their crimes. I suppose you could make a case for some of them before people were being beaten

755
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:13,000
and murdered and hiding weapons so the police don't find out- what the- what is going on?

756
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,240
Is that where you guys dumped Tyler's guns?

757
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:15,800
Correct.

758
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:19,160
But it's hard to root for these characters considering the lengths they're willing to go

759
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,920
to lie and cover up the truth of what really happened. They appear to make up their own

760
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:27,320
moral code as they go along and take the law into their own hands, which would be fine if

761
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:32,280
this show was treated for what it is and not sold as if it's this important learning tool

762
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:35,240
for young people to start having a conversation.

763
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:38,440
The show, which obviously is a weighty and important show-

764
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:42,680
Justin doesn't particularly get up to much this season aside from dealing drugs from

765
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:46,840
the 13 Reasons Why coffee shop they're all obsessed with. I suppose this and any other

766
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:50,600
show would be quite a big deal, but that's a relatively tame story beat compared to

767
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:54,440
everything else that's going on. We're told that Justin has an intense bond with Clay

768
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:58,760
as he was adopted into the Jensen family last season, but I can't help but wonder why Justin

769
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:02,120
wasn't used more in the investigation side of the mystery. It would have made a lot more

770
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:06,200
sense to me to have Justin and Clay team up to find out the truth of what happened. It's

771
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:10,040
not like a lack of motivation would be an issue seeing as they both have fairly intimate

772
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:14,040
backstories with Bryce at this point. I suppose we always have next season to explore the

773
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,960
sexual tension of Justin and Clay.

774
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:21,640
I'd do anything for you. Anything. Same.

775
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:30,120
This character cannot seem to catch a break. His first love killed herself, one lover had

776
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:35,880
a bipolar breakdown and changed school, and his latest fling chose a serial sex offender

777
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:40,280
over him. But that's not to say that this character is particularly likable otherwise.

778
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:44,280
I have no issues with the actor, I don't blame him at all. In fact, the actors are probably

779
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:48,280
the only reason anyone likes this show to begin with. However, Clay is so earnest and

780
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:52,040
trusting of everyone, to the point where I'm fairly sick of him and his bullshit.

781
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:53,260
What?

782
01:08:55,480 --> 01:09:00,200
His character really started to crumble the moment he put himself in front of an armed

783
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:05,400
shooter in a misguided and dangerous attempt to be like a superhero like one of the comics

784
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,200
he loves so much.

785
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,920
You just ripped my favorite character to shreds.

786
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:13,080
At first I was disappointed that the ghost visions of Hannah that were prevalent in season

787
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:18,200
2 had subsided, seemingly for good. However, they had to have at least one scene where,

788
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:22,760
this time, Clay has a showdown with Ghost Brice, which I quite enjoyed.

789
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:27,480
I may be gone from this earth, but I will be reborn in the bodies of a million men.

790
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:32,680
My theory is that the next season is gonna be, in part anyway, about some kind of mental illness

791
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:36,840
that Clay is diagnosed with. My reasoning for this being that in one scene, his parents

792
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:41,000
question Justin in a way that seems to indicate they have reason to believe he has something

793
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,560
going on mentally. We'll have to wait and see on that one though.

794
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:51,880
Clay's main purpose in the story this season is to be another red herring. You're supposed

795
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:55,880
to believe that he was capable of being the one who murdered Brice. It even goes so far

796
01:09:55,880 --> 01:10:00,200
at one point that he's the main suspect in the case and is actually arrested. I fail to feel

797
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:04,600
much sympathy for him though, because ultimately this entire situation could have been avoided

798
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:09,480
if he wasn't such a moron and kept secrets from everyone. This school shooter aspect has spiraled

799
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:14,600
the plot out of control so fast, all because of the way most of the characters agreed to cover for-

800
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:23,160
Season two obviously ended with the bombshell of Clay stopping Tyler from going Columbine,

801
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:27,640
so the results ripple into season three and have to be explained away with the most moronic

802
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:31,880
decision-making this group has made yet. Instead of getting this kid the help he clearly needs

803
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:36,600
and making sure he takes liability for his actions, they dividend responsibility between

804
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:42,200
the group and implicate themselves to make sure Tyler is never given a chance to snap again

805
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:47,880
and murder people. Yeah, that's their plan. Wow, these mental health expert children.

806
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:50,680
Most characters are deeply frightened of what he's capable of.

807
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:58,920
And Clay even admits that he has nightmares about being slaughtered by him.

808
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:02,280
In the dream, you pull the trigger.

809
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:07,000
Luckily though, Tyler is made out to be such a sweetheart to make sure to justify the ridiculous

810
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,160
actions of last season. They try to make the case that it was all worth it in the end,

811
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:16,120
that Clay made the right decision. Step in front of a shooter. Go on, that's clever,

812
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:20,120
because he's just a human after all. However, being the complete imbeciles that they are,

813
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:25,720
they decided to hide his bag of dangerous firearms in the water where fishermen constantly peruse,

814
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:30,120
so obviously the season ends with a tease of the guns being found, implying that part of next

815
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:35,480
season all sorts of drama is going to unfold. I'm glad, quite frankly, they deserve everything

816
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:39,960
that is coming to them. Most of the scenes with Tyler are him apologizing for nearly killing his

817
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:45,560
classmates and coming to terms with the horrendous abuse he received in the last episode of season 2

818
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,280
at the hands of...

819
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:53,160
Um, so yeah, Monty kind of steps in as the lead villain in Liberty.

820
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:58,120
This character is fairly similar to Bryce. He's not quite his mustache twirling, but they take his

821
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:02,200
character in a similar direction in terms of giving him a sad backstory, where it turns out

822
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:07,000
he's a closeted gay with a nasty father. His main role in the plot is to effectively be set up as

823
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,680
another red herring and eventually be the fall guy for Bryce's death.

824
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:14,360
Monty realized that the cycle had to be broken somehow.

825
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:19,000
So the others can get away with murder and cover it up. He also conveniently gets killed

826
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,520
off-screen, as we're told by the police that he was killed in jail.

827
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:27,400
But Montgomery De La Cruz was killed in his jail cell just hours ago.

828
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:31,160
I suppose you can have a crystal clear conscience, can't you, you monsters?

829
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:32,680
Okay, he was a human being.

830
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:33,960
Oh, gosh, shut your face.

831
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:42,040
This is the final character I briefly want to talk about because he's my personal favorite.

832
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:45,400
He's the only one who calls the group out on their idiotic decision-making.

833
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:51,720
This is bullshit. I'm out. I'm scared of you. And to be honest, I don't trust you.

834
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:01,640
We even see how kind he is to Bryce's ex-girlfriend in the fairly preachy

835
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:05,000
Planned Parenthood episode, which I haven't really talked about because...

836
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,360
I'm going to explain the procedure to you, and you will order some paper now,

837
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:12,040
and you will come back Saturday morning. When you return Saturday,

838
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,320
we will take your blood pressure.

839
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:19,800
That's most of what stood out about season three to me.

840
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,920
There's plenty of minutiae that could be talked about in more detail,

841
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:26,200
but honestly, I could be here forever talking about how bad this is.

842
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:29,400
As you can tell, and you'll especially know this if you've watched it yourself,

843
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:32,360
this is easily the messiest and most ridiculous season yet.

844
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:35,560
It so desperately wants to be taken seriously that it winds up becoming

845
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:39,320
even more of a parody of itself than the depths it sunk to in season two.

846
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:43,080
It's utterly tone-deaf, nothing about the production is particularly interesting

847
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:46,440
in terms of presentation, and even when they attempt something stylistic,

848
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:47,800
it falls flat on its face.

849
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,520
I'm of course talking about the ridiculous amounts of flashbacks

850
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:53,400
the show is structured around that have a slightly different color palette,

851
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,760
but the timeline is so muddled, it doesn't do much to help you understand

852
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:59,400
where and where a scene is supposed to be taking place.

853
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:03,320
The gross oversimplification of heavy subjects is as bad as ever,

854
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:06,520
shock value is appreciated over any real character arcs,

855
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:09,960
and the murder mystery angle is an extremely silly, pulpy beat

856
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,760
that only adds to the overall melodrama of the show.

857
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:16,760
Personally, I found it to be fairly enjoyable in a so-bad-that-it's-good kind of way,

858
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:20,120
mostly because of the shock of where the writers chose to take this season,

859
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,600
and I have to say I'm fairly excited for how they're going to

860
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,600
attempt to continue this mess of a story,

861
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,680
but this is no doubt the weakest season yet.

862
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:29,400
They've written themselves into such a corner by forcing the show

863
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,480
to go so far beyond its source material,

864
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,800
that at this point I'm curiously along for the ride,

865
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:37,560
purely for how they're going to try to keep this material weighty and important

866
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:39,800
while the stupidity continues to escalate.

867
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:41,960
I suppose they're the winners in the end, though.

868
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:44,840
They kept this conversation going for a bloody long video,

869
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:48,440
so I suppose that's the failure of 13 Reasons Why season 3.

870
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,040
It's really bad.

871
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:53,240
Thank you, I hate everything.

872
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,480
What a delightful appearance.

873
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:57,160
He truly is a loving person.

874
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:59,000
Let's finish this off, then.

875
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,680
If 13 Reasons Why was just about the first season,

876
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:11,560
we could have a fair discussion about how it treats its subjects,

877
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:13,880
where it comes through, and where it falls short.

878
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:17,880
By the time it's continuing to string along various audiences by two and three

879
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,360
with these narratives that are frankly rather worrying

880
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,040
when treated the way they have been,

881
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:25,000
it reaches a stage where one has to ask whether it's worth it.

882
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:29,400
With a full season on the horizon, I know there is not really much I can do.

883
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:32,520
From what I understand, it will be the final season of the show, thankfully,

884
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:35,880
but it seems mad to me that in the face of numerous critically acclaimed shows

885
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:38,840
being cancelled, this one has continued to steamroll through.

886
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:41,640
It sucks, because I do feel that everyone deserves better.

887
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:45,640
The cast deserves better, the topics deserve better, the audience deserves better.

888
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:47,800
I'm sure there are a lot of people who care about this,

889
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:50,680
but whoever's in charge just doesn't care enough,

890
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:54,200
or doesn't understand enough to make it seem like they care.

891
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:57,800
It's hard to make a show that has this discussion, I understand that.

892
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:01,240
You can't expect to put your foot in the right place all the time.

893
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:04,760
I know I couldn't, and there will undoubtedly be times where you deal with criticism

894
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:08,520
for the handling of something that people may feel has negative implications,

895
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,200
and that doesn't mean you're wrong,

896
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:13,560
it just means it's a sensitive topic that people feel strongly about.

897
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:16,600
However, with 13 Reasons Why, in each progressive season,

898
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:19,800
the creators seem to care less and less about the creation of narratives

899
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:22,840
that actually discuss these problems, and more just touching on them

900
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:27,320
for the sake of conflict through a provocative reaction, and that genuinely sucks.

901
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:30,120
It sucks that they can just put a little disclaimer at the start,

902
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:33,720
and think that they're sufficiently preparing people for what they're about to experience.

903
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:37,720
It's like putting an age rating on a game, who actually abides by that?

904
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:41,960
Difference is that this is mental health, and an assertion of realism in this world,

905
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:46,680
and a lot of games are more clearly defined on the bounds of reality and fantasy.

906
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:51,400
It doesn't change much, and it certainly doesn't change their failure to handle topics with nuance,

907
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:55,720
and the only real reason that it's continuing is because it indulges a certain audience

908
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:59,480
who is going to continue to commit to watching it, and I get it,

909
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:03,480
there aren't too many shows that have attempted to portray mental illness in teenagers,

910
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:08,040
though they're out there, but as many people have noted, this doesn't do it accurately,

911
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:12,600
and it misses out on one of the greatest elements, the element of getting help.

912
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:16,200
I would like to have seen a few scenes where a character has professional therapy,

913
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:20,120
talks over the problems they're encountering, the problem is that they never seek help,

914
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:24,840
and the fact that they try to talk about it with other students who are mentally volatile too

915
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:28,440
leads to this heightened conflict, and it might be good to create a plot,

916
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,600
but it's not really what you should be promoting.

917
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:34,120
There should be a point where characters like Clay Jensen are seeking help,

918
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:37,240
because by the third season, he is just painful to watch.

919
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:40,840
I hope at the actual end of the fourth and final season, he goes and gets help,

920
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:45,000
because I feel like the only reason they've been holding off that is to build conflict.

921
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,600
The school counselor is the closest they get to that solution, and even then,

922
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:52,760
the only character who really has an ongoing relationship is Tyler in the third season,

923
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:55,640
and most of those discussions are nice, but not that deep,

924
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:59,400
and the fact that it takes them three seasons to get there is kinda sad.

925
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:02,520
Also, they still never really frame it as a clear solution,

926
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:04,760
more just another plot element that's there,

927
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,720
but I guarantee if some of these characters took some time out,

928
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:11,240
they'd probably feel a lot better, but that's not what drives conflict.

929
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:15,000
If you're suffering from mental health difficulties, there may be solutions out there.

930
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,960
Not every solution works for everyone, I understand that,

931
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:23,080
but I don't think 13 Reasons Why is good for vulnerable people looking for a quote discussion.

932
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:25,880
Speaking as someone who has had his own mental problems,

933
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:28,520
the show left me extremely emotionally drained,

934
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:31,080
probably around the midpoint of the third season,

935
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:34,280
I felt at my lowest point mentally I had in months,

936
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:36,200
and I don't think that was a coincidence,

937
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:39,000
because everyone was just so unnecessarily angry,

938
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,040
the conflict grates on you, all that negative energy,

939
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:44,440
at the end you're almost relieved they resolved it,

940
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:47,080
but after being relieved, I felt conned,

941
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:51,480
they just forced a load of bullshit conflict and then resolved it to make me feel better.

942
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:56,200
It's like setting a building on fire, putting it out, and calling yourself the fire brigade.

943
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:59,320
They've had three seasons to get this right,

944
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:02,680
going by their baseball standards I'd say that's three strikes,

945
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:05,400
if you've watched it and it's changed your life for the better,

946
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,160
I cannot take that away from you,

947
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:10,040
but I think they've really failed to change a lot of people's lives,

948
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:13,640
and I'd be skeptical of how much they have helped the conversation.

949
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:17,320
If you're not doing great mentally, this show wouldn't receive my endorsements,

950
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:21,960
I think it's a placebo of sorts, and one that provokes a reaction that wears off rather quickly,

951
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:25,640
at this point I'd normally recommend a series that does handle it better,

952
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:28,200
but to be honest, I haven't really watched that many,

953
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:32,600
one that my friends always recommend is Bojack Horseman, which I definitely plan on watching soon,

954
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:36,360
though if any of my audience members would like to share some ideas of good shows

955
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:38,280
about mental health in the comments below,

956
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:41,160
then I'm sure there'd be people out there who'd love to hear them.

957
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:45,000
If you're doing mentally well, 13 reasons why I wouldn't get my endorsement either,

958
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,760
because seasons 2 and 3 especially just outright suck.

959
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:53,400
Overall conflict, contradictory values, and generally just what appears to be a motivation

960
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:56,200
to milk the discourse rather than actually contribute to it,

961
01:19:56,200 --> 01:20:01,080
and the fact that it has persisted despite the criticism from people all over the creative

962
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:06,600
and medical spectrum is the failure of 13 reasons why we are done here.

963
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:14,280
So yeah, that was the video, a really really fun one, so much fun,

964
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:20,840
I had such a great time making it, and I hope that I can continue having a great, fantastic time,

965
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:25,480
I'd like to give a big shout out to the editors, they did a fantastic banger job,

966
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:31,320
fist bumps to all the editors, I don't know who you are yet, but I love you, I love you guys.

967
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:36,280
Shout out to my Patreons, my big old Patrons, oh Patrons, I used to call them Patreons,

968
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:40,280
but some people get annoyed that I call them Patreons, because I'm just trying to define them

969
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:46,520
from the regular Patreon, but I'll say Patron, so shout out to my Patrons, hey,

970
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:51,320
and all the ones that are $10 plus are on the screen right now, but we're not finished there,

971
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:56,200
we gotta give some more special shout outs, because I've got some big, big names,

972
01:20:56,200 --> 01:21:03,480
I got a big shout out to Be More Cool J, what a cool dude, Brandon, Christopher Karras, Stanton,

973
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:09,960
all $100 Patreons, and they're my $50 Patreons, Caroline, Hypercube, and some Hullabaloo,

974
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:15,080
I did it in different order this week, you see I'm feeling extra spicy today, but thanks again guys,

975
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:21,560
you're all the best, you're all the dogs, and I appreciate and love you guys, so,

976
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:28,440
I don't really have much else to say, keep up the fantastic work, and if you wanna speak to me,

977
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:32,120
you can reach out to my Twitter, that's probably one I reply on the most, though I haven't been

978
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:36,600
getting to DMs too much recently, because I've been busy, probably that's the best shout,

979
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:40,840
Discord in the pinned comment, Facebook also in the pinned comment, though I haven't been using

980
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:48,600
that much recently, Instagram too, I sometimes chill on there, so, not too much else to add,

981
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:57,960
have a good week, I've given up with the world, but I'm still here, so take care, chaps,

982
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,960
all you fantastic chaps.

983
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:12,840
I'll see you guys in the next one.
