0	9920	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the right opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,
9920	15480	and TV shows, honestly something that I have an interest in, but seldom get around to actually watching.
15480	20640	My biggest problem is how much time they tend to consume, and although I promise you I have too much free time,
20640	26400	TM, it's not that I typically decide to dedicate all towards one TV show, I like to allocate it across various
26400	32360	activities to maintain some mental wellbeing, because after all, in this world called YouTube, we can all use that
32360	38320	from time to time. I mostly indulge my time in films, which are typically shorter in total, with exceptions,
38320	44960	and gaming, because as I have always asserted, I am a gamer. Nonetheless, recently I have found myself in an
44960	50400	interesting predicament because YouTube's slow monetization process has basically delayed so many of my videos
50400	55200	that I found myself with a weak on my hands, and a desire to cover something slightly different.
55440	61200	So without further ado, I suggest we tackle that slightly different subject on this glorious, glorious day,
61200	66400	and if you have some basic reading capabilities, you will know that this is 13 Reasons Why.
66400	73600	13 Reasons Why is a TV show that currently spans three seasons, although a fourth is expected too, so hooray for that.
73600	80160	It is based on the young adult novel by Jay Asher, and the first series was released originally in 2017,
80160	86720	to a furor of applause and acclaim from critics and audiences alike. However, it is not without its controversy.
86720	93440	What is the basis of this controversy? Well, 13 Reasons Why is a show that, like many films and TV series,
93440	98720	tackles tough issues. However, one of the central characters and narrators of this show, someone by the name of
98720	104160	Hannah Baker, is resenting their narrative from the perspective of a deceased individual, but on top of that,
104160	110000	she committed suicide, and left behind 13 tapes. These 13 tapes were each addressed to an individual
110000	115280	who she felt had played a role in the situation that finally resulted in her death. These tapes would then
115280	120720	circulate through each subject, being passed on until they completed their cycle. It is a show that asks
120720	126480	questions regarding accountability, school environments, but it's also very graphic and intense, and not for the
126480	132000	faint of heart. When covering any sensitive topic in a dramatized fashion, there will almost always be
132000	137440	controversy, because many people have many different feelings on how to deal with these topics, and many
137440	142320	people will have strong feelings on them, and therefore, even the occasional misstep will be viciously
142320	147360	scrutinized, because if these things aren't done with the utmost delicacy, it could also lead to dangerous
147360	153200	social outcomes. The first season of 13 Reasons Why was promoted under the guise of mental health discourse.
153200	158160	In fact, if you watch the version now, you might see a disclaimer from one of the cast members stating that
158160	164720	the intention of the series is to start a discussion, it was a significant marketing point. Therefore, at first
164720	170640	when it came out, I kind of theorized that its messages probably bordered on inflammatory at points, but didn't do
170640	176000	anything too egregious, because overall, it has still been well received. However, by the time the second season
176000	181440	came, I began to well have second thoughts. The first season had been based on the book, as mentioned, however,
181440	186880	the second season completely deviated from that, and I felt that move veered more on the side of exploitive,
186880	192160	especially given how the original series was promoted. I assume maybe there was just a heavy demand, maybe it
192160	196800	made a significant difference to some people's lives, but regardless, given the moderate success of the first
196800	202880	season, I understood why it existed. Nonetheless, this season was not well received by critics, and audiences
202880	208000	didn't seem to be particularly ecstatic either, although it is difficult to tell how the committed fans reacted.
208000	212960	I assumed this would be the end, however, I was rather irritated when I heard that there would be, in fact,
212960	218800	a third season, a move that I found frankly rather insulting, but ho-hum, maybe it would be better.
220960	225600	Okay, never mind then, I figured at this point, a majority of the audience must have been but the most
225600	230560	dedicated viewers of this show, who clearly felt that the messages mixed with the high school environment
230560	235520	resonated with them. I really didn't see much additional value being drawn from it, and I also developed
235520	240080	a sentiment of concern, because if they're still trying to send these social messages about all of these
240080	245200	topics yet receiving such a significant amount of criticism, they can't be doing a particularly good job.
245200	250160	My concern here was that, ultimately, 13 Reasons Why had an audience who supported them on the basis of
250160	254400	their takes on these sensitive issues, yet their artistic failure to carry through these messages
254400	258800	could well have negative social ramifications, particularly if the intended audience were more
258800	263360	vulnerable individuals. Now, I did not guarantee to find exactly this, but I also know that there has
263360	268400	been a lot of debate over it, and I hope to at least provide my own stance on it, with a caveat of caution
268400	273760	and nuance to those interested in watching the series. There's an inconvenient truth, sometimes what
273760	278640	might be most critically acclaimed or artistically bold or emotionally gripping may not be the best
278640	282480	for an individual's health, and that's something that comes particularly to a head with a show like
282480	287600	13 Reasons Why, and for a show that attempts to tread both borders with some amount of sensitivity,
287600	292720	I'd say it's ultimately a fundamental failure, and with the fourth season on the horizon, it should
292720	297600	probably take a moment for some self-reflection in its messages. The accrue behind 13 Reasons Why
297600	301520	has made it clear that their intended audience has been those who are mentally vulnerable,
301520	306320	and therefore that is something that cannot be discounted. I'm aware that my voice will
306320	310320	ultimately have very little effect, and the show will continue to steamroll its way into Brian
310320	314640	Yorkie's bank account, but if this video makes anyone take another look at the show, then I consider
314640	319040	that a victory. I'm going to be outlining the plot of each season, before diving into my own personal
319040	322960	thoughts and feelings regarding how the show tackles these issues, and the success slash
322960	327680	shortcomings of this coverage, so without further ado, I suggest we get into it. I will
327680	331920	preface this by saying that there will be spoilers. Let's go.
334640	339120	Now I briefly mentioned the premise of season 1 while introducing this video, but I shall go into
339120	343440	a bit more depth. There are two narratives that we have to observe, the first one being
343440	347760	Hannah Baker, the deceased individual whose narrative is presented post-mortem on these
347760	352720	13 tapes, and mostly follows her account through the state of flashbacks, and the second being the
352720	357360	recipient of these tapes, Clay Jensen, whose narrative is mostly followed through present day.
357360	362240	There is an episode dedicated to each tape, we follow Clay as he listens to them, and sometimes
362240	366560	struggles to listen to them, interspersed with relevant flashbacks which run adjacent to Hannah
366560	370960	Baker's narrative. We also follow Clay's own reaction to this, which may lead to certain
370960	376240	behaviour when certain truths are revealed. There are many various arcs, as would be expected
376240	381200	on a TV show, but the tapes are directed at individuals whom Hannah feels contributed to
381200	385600	her suicide, sometimes through merely being complicit in a culture, or just being a straight
385600	390240	out rapist. Hannah's parents are planning to sue the school for their inaction, and other students
390240	394400	who are the subjects of these tapes are trying to prevent the release of these tapes. Another
394400	399360	student, Tony Padilla, keeps an eye to make sure each person listens to these tapes. There are many
399360	404720	other minor conflicts and tensions, but I shan't focus too much on them. Now, realism is a really
404720	409600	important point when staying committed to recreating these environments. Not every film or
409600	415280	TV show has to abide by basic fundamental laws that we may expect from the real world, in fact,
415280	420400	many don't, even the ones that may seem grounded in principle. But 13 Reasons Why has a few more
420400	425280	rules to abide by because they seek to portray the human condition, and environments that market
425280	430400	relatability to their audiences. Therefore, certain elements of logic and realism have to be followed
430400	435440	by in these instances. So realism will be discussed here, not just from a social perspective, but from
435440	440240	an artistic perspective as well. I want to first focus on the premise, the fact that Hannah is
440240	444800	recording the series of tapes, and directing them at specific individuals following her death.
444800	449360	This has probably been one of the major sources of the controversy, being called out by many as
449360	454080	unhealthily indulging in revenge fantasy. Now, this is where we should talk about the portrayal
454080	458160	of Hannah Baker herself. She isn't the sole focal point of the narrative, and therefore,
458160	463440	the writers have a bit more leeway to not present her as this all positive protagonist. Therefore,
463440	468160	I didn't immediately object to her having less than amiable intentions regarding the creation of
468160	472480	these tapes, because ultimately, it is the framing of the character that would define how she is
472480	477440	presented to the audience. People don't always do the best thing, it's just important that there's
477440	479440	some awareness of that.
481840	485680	Hannah Baker- See, I can guarantee that one of the reasons that you're still listening
486320	493120	is that you really want to know, who are the others? Who else is responsible for my death?
493680	499520	Unfortunately, 13 Reasons Why doesn't really have that. For me, I received the impression that Clay's
499520	504080	present day reaction was meant to be the core narrative that we were meant to emotionally follow,
504080	506560	with certain deviations when he lashed out a little.
507760	509760	Clay- Then she's not helping.
510720	511840	Clay- I don't wanna help.
511840	516960	And even those behaviours seem to fall on Clay, rather than Hannah. Ultimately, their handling was
516960	522320	a failed opportunity to look into the dangers of creating a series of tapes. Accountability
522320	527200	doesn't dissipate after you die, and although the tragedy should never be undermined at the
527200	531680	same time, we shouldn't be afraid to analyse the morality of the actions themselves that
531680	535920	come before. If the writing of other characters wasn't so on the nose, then their nuance may
535920	539760	have been able to come through, because there are characters who dispute the release of these tapes,
539760	543920	and even the details. For example, Jessica Davis, the subject of the second tape,
543920	546960	tells Clay that Hannah was lying about certain details.
546960	552080	Jessica- What she said? On the tapes? About us and Monet's? She's the one who stopped coming,
552080	556880	not me. She's the one who ended our friendship, and she knew it. She's a liar.
558720	559520	It wasn't a liar.
560160	565120	However, by the end of the same episode, they use blatant dialogue to tell the audience that
565120	570240	she clearly wasn't lying. Jessica- If Hannah was lying, why are you here?
570240	574320	It was such an underplayed conflict that it basically had no reason to exist,
574320	578800	and it was a missed opportunity to look into the implications of such tapes. When someone
578800	583920	takes their own life, they are more often a victim of some circumstance. However, at the same time,
583920	588000	content published with knowledge of their impending death may be questionable in its
588000	593600	information, for two reasons. Firstly, a deceased individual won't have to face down the consequences
593600	598720	of those narratives, and secondly, as they are a perceived victim, it will yield their post-mortem
598720	603440	content more power, which is exactly what is demonstrated in season two, but we'll get to
603440	608400	that eventually. However, even with that said, it is revealed later on the tapes that she did
608400	613120	get a detail wrong, regarding another tape directed at Zack, a high school student who
613120	617120	basically stole compliments from Hannah's compliment bag after she embarrassed him
617120	620320	publicly. In the tapes, she says he threw a compliment away.
620320	624480	Jessica- I was hoping once you read the letter, you'd get it. You'd realize how much I needed
624480	626320	those silly things you were stealing from me.
630560	632560	I guess I wasn't even worth the reaction.
633600	638240	And yet, it's revealed he actually kept it. However, this habit of getting details wrong
638240	641760	doesn't appear again, so I'm not really sure what we're meant to do with it.
641760	645920	The only basis that it would have changed under is if we were still unsure about the validity of
645920	651280	the tapes, but the subjects of the tapes act in such a purposefully self-incriminating way that
651280	663360	it's not a point of contention, so ultimately, it just becomes this loose end, and we're left
663360	667840	wondering if we should be lending the emotional value to the tapes that the writers clearly want
667840	672960	us to. It's hard to tell if revenge is the direct motivation, however, it does appear at multiple
672960	677280	points throughout the series. Probably the worst example of this is in episode four, a tape
677280	682240	dedicated to an individual named Tyler, a creep who took photos of her at her home, and evaded
682240	686640	her privacy, finally escalating when he took and shared a picture of her kissing another girl
686640	712400	named Courtney. In her tape, she says this. This is followed by Clay, the present-day protagonist,
712400	717040	taking a picture of Tyler's bare buttocks and sending it to the whole school. Now this was a bad
717040	721360	idea for many reasons, and some characters even observe this, but there's little resolution or
721360	727040	focus that says how bad an idea this was, and it was a really bad idea. Let's go into that.
729600	735120	Bad ideas, they're common in this show, sometimes that's okay when they're framed as bad ideas,
735120	740000	but often you end up with this sort of ass pic scene, no real closure because the tapes have
740000	744800	moved on to their next subjects, and this leads to some real incoherence on actual morals.
745360	749760	Scenes like those are made to stick out, made to shock, and therefore they stick in your head,
749760	754320	and when I reflect on them, I don't really think they had any resolve or any conclusion that was
754320	759200	meant to be presented to the audience. By the end of episode seven, and thus tape seven, Hannah Baker
759200	763760	says this. Hannah Baker- No one knows what's really going on in another person's life,
764720	768560	and you never know how what you do will affect someone else.
768560	773280	Which is 100% true, but it's also a factor that has been neglected multiple times throughout
773280	778080	the series. This is in part due to the fact that as a central narrative, Hannah's narrative doesn't
778080	782560	really receive much scrutiny from the characters, and when it does, these characters are presented
782560	788160	as mostly antagonistic, and therefore not making a sincere case. The flashbacks are hard to dispute,
788160	792480	given how they are mostly promoted as faithful information, and the possible misinformation
792960	798000	isn't given nearly enough to add to that depth. And once again, I don't think this would be a
798000	802400	central problem if Hannah's narrative was presented as inherently flawed, but it's not,
802400	806880	and that means that she's much more presented as this martyr rather than the flawed person
806880	812000	she clearly is as well. A lot of the time, I felt the extent that each individual was responsible
812000	816880	had a level of ambiguity surrounding them, and by the end, I don't think people are remotely
816880	821680	the wiser, because the characters being held accountable never really have much of a discussion
821680	827840	regarding it. Characters like Justin, Courtney, Marcus are so irrationally out to sabotage Hannah
827840	832320	and make sure Clay doesn't release this information, it becomes a melodrama, which
832320	836400	ultimately neglects that this could have been a poignant look at responsibility.
837360	858800	And it's not like I'm sure these characters shouldn't have angry or rational interactions,
858800	863200	but the best moments of the TV series were when they were having low key conversations,
863200	867760	or moments when there was absolutely no dialogue at all, and we were finding out things about these
867760	872960	characters that made them human too. Too much of the focus was on this cover-up plot, which just
872960	877360	reached levels of ridicule at points, and it detracted from the grounded nature of how teens
877360	881600	might deal with these things. I feel that there is such a melodrama, it made it hard for me to feel
881600	886560	emotionally invested. On the contrary, one of the best characters was Hannah's mother, Olivia.
886560	892160	Whenever she was on screen, I felt compelled, because she conveyed the grief and pain from
892160	896960	the experience of losing your own daughter, and that was something that I felt was so neglected
896960	902960	elsewhere. She wanted justice, and she generated realistic melodrama, her pursuit against the school
902960	908000	for justice seemed well founded yet disruptive, which is the right balance, and one that isn't
908000	913280	obtained elsewhere in the story. A lot of people have spoken about how each tape isn't really
913280	918160	proportional against who they're directed towards, and I agree to an extent, I think the problem
918560	923040	is less that some of the tapes had less serious topics, but moreover the fact that they focused
923040	927520	on the individual rather than the feelings that they represented. Abandonment, embarrassment,
927520	932000	betrayal, alienation are all factors that can really drive someone to a deprived mental state,
932000	937360	however often they're a lot less accountable to individuals, more so just general environment and
937360	942480	circumstances, and I feel the directed blame was a case of trying to prioritise melodrama over
942480	946720	realism. However, the fact that Hannah seems to assign those feelings to an individual means that
946720	950880	the actual feelings that drove the reaction seem underrepresented, and this is where the
950880	955600	whole revenge narrative is at its ugliness. The problem is that the whole motivation of this
955600	960400	impending lawsuit by Hannah's mother is that the high school culture was responsible, a culture
960400	966480	that many people are only really guilty of being complicit, with a few exceptions. Because some of
966480	970960	the individuals in the tapes don't necessarily do anything drastically terrible, however as a
970960	975920	recipient of the worst of high school culture, Hannah Baker should have been aware that naming
975920	981120	people directly in a tape linked to her suicide could really negatively impact their lives if
981120	985360	these tapes were released. The whole point was that high school students were creating social
985360	990640	hierarchies off surface level judgements, what would make any of the people on the tapes above
990640	994160	that scrutiny, some of whom clearly didn't deserve it.
1006080	1010720	Characterisation is another point that many people feel wasn't covered well enough in the series,
1010720	1014800	and that's an important factor considering that the show makes the assertion of starting a
1014800	1019120	discussion around mental wellbeing. For me, it's a mixed bag, there are some really good
1019120	1023120	interactions that would reflect someone going through those stages of suffering, and obviously
1023120	1027360	there needs to be some conflict, that's how plots are created, but there are multiple points where
1027360	1032560	the high school seems ridiculously over the top. There's at least one scene where all the students
1032720	1036960	just take their phones out at once and start smirking at the same time, talking amongst each
1036960	1041840	other, and it's so contrived. Often they try to make Hannah out to be at the mercy of the whole
1041840	1046560	damn school, I think this was because they wanted to frame it as her having nowhere to go eventually,
1046560	1051200	but you really didn't need to do that to generate that feeling. Once again, if they could frame the
1051200	1055840	paranoia that such rumours create, rather than pretending that paranoia is only the reality,
1055840	1060560	then they would kill two birds with one stone, they'd accurately represent the flawed state of
1060560	1064960	mind that that mentality creates, and they'd accurately portray the high school environment,
1064960	1069760	rather than merging the two and presenting that perception as truth, something that would serve
1069760	1075360	to perpetuate the idea that this scenario is much worse than it actually is. It panders to negative
1075360	1080960	stereotypes that suicidal audiences are most prone to believing, and presents it as verity.
1080960	1085600	As a show that wants to connect with a more vulnerable audience, that sort of outlook seems
1085600	1094560	rather inappropriate. As 13 Reasons Why goes, it presents itself as a discourse on accountability
1094560	1099200	and responsibility. We observe a group of students come to terms with their participation in a toxic
1099200	1103680	culture, this narrative could have worked if it was presented through the eyes of a neutral party,
1103680	1108320	or no party at all, but the problem is that we have the added detail that the narrative is
1108320	1113200	presented by the victim themselves. This was clearly to add height and conflict, and more
1113200	1117840	intimacy, but in doing that, while combining it with the motivation to create a fully accurate
1117840	1122160	portrayal, they succeed in making Hannah the perfect victim. The problem is that because
1122160	1126400	the narrative is post-mortem, it is presented without challenge, and we never really learn
1126400	1131200	much about Hannah or her imperfections, even when she might behave in a way that seems irrational,
1131200	1136160	it's never subject to much scrutiny, because the narrative just continues. The only real dispute
1136160	1140880	comes regarding whether she's lying, and we all know how well that plotline is pursued.
1140880	1145360	In an attempt to keep the narrative as rational and coherent as possible, it undermines the fact
1145360	1149680	that many suicide victims have mental health problems and other factors that will influence
1149680	1154640	a person's mental state to drive them to that position. It goes too far to rationalise the
1154640	1160080	situation, even if it notes that it is not a good option. It makes the act seem very calculated,
1160080	1164560	which is what leads people to this revenge narrative. I don't think the premise necessarily
1164560	1169760	comes across as vengeful, but it's very easy to look at that delivery and see it as just that,
1169760	1174320	a really good example is in the final episode, where the flashback takes us to the school
1174320	1178160	counsellor's office regarding a sexual assault case, which honestly is something we'll get to
1178160	1181840	very soon, but in this instance, the counsellor isn't empathetic enough.
1181840	1187040	It happened, Hannah, and I believe you, but if you won't confront him,
1188320	1195920	then the only other choice is to move on. Yeah, that's just what I'm gonna have to do.
1195920	1200480	But the flashback also goes the distance to make sure it is very clear that no one is blatantly
1200480	1204480	in the wrong, but afterwards, Clay's narrative cuts through implying that the counsellor should
1204480	1208720	have pursued her after she gave him the impression that she didn't want to talk, a very strong
1208720	1213200	impression, I must add. There could have been legitimate discussion at that point for what
1213200	1217360	more can and can't be done sometimes, but they just kind of leave the point unchallenged,
1217360	1222880	ending on this romanticised final, who really cares speech. People did care, and I think
1222880	1227680	setting the bar that high justifies an unfair expectation from many people, and undermines
1227680	1230800	their own humanity in a way, and what they may be going through as well.
1230800	1234960	I think I made myself very clear that no one's coming forward to stop me.
1237120	1243200	Some of you cared, none of you cared enough, and neither did I, and I'm sorry.
1245760	1250400	And I understand, I guess, what they were trying to do with the idea that everyone has a perspective,
1250400	1254640	it is a running theme, but the problem is that vulnerable individuals looking to adopt Hannah's
1254640	1259040	perspective would find it rather easy to do so because the narrative isn't presented as flawed
1259040	1263200	enough. The show starts a discussion, but one of the points of view implied by the narrative
1263200	1268960	dictates that an individual can be justified in taking their own life on the basis of circumstances
1268960	1273440	assumed, which is something that I and a lot of people don't agree with. There's been a lot of
1273440	1278480	controversy surrounding the increased rates of suicide following the show, it's hard to prove
1278480	1282640	anything with post-hoc measurement, and it's not an environment that would be ethically viable to
1282640	1287680	manipulate, so cause and effect can never really be established. It's also impossible to measure
1287680	1292000	how many lives the show may have saved, so I do take this perspective with a grain of salt,
1292000	1297200	but typically the concern from many individuals is that such a suicide depicted and published
1297200	1302000	can provoke copycat incidents. Ironically, a copycat incident is depicted on the show
1302000	1306480	when one of the characters, Alex, tries to shoot himself following this ongoing conflict.
1307120	1312160	There are researchers who posit that it may well be the famous suicide scene that causes this,
1312160	1316640	but I think it's more likely to just be the general theme of the show. You don't want to give
1316640	1323040	people any reasons why, let alone 13, not unopposed at least, and the challenges against these reasons
1323040	1327440	just come across as a bit lackluster. Now, the scene itself is controversial in other ways,
1327440	1332080	in fact it's so controversial that Netflix removed it altogether, bit late for that, but I've seen
1332160	1336560	many people praise it for its rawness, and as a scene that feels important to the storyline,
1336560	1342000	a convergence of the narratives, and I'll say it, it is powerful. However, at the same time,
1342000	1345840	those scenes aren't gonna be the ones that start discussions, they're gonna be the ones
1345840	1350320	to provoke emotional reactions, and although artistically it might feel like the right thing
1350320	1355760	to do, socially I can see why a lot of people took issue with it. I don't know if the crew
1355760	1361280	behind 13 Reasons Why anticipated that their audience were gonna be as sensitive as they were,
1361280	1365840	from what I understand, a lot of disclaimers have been placed in post-release, and I guess it would
1365840	1370400	have been hard to completely ascertain that, but if they wanted to start a discussion, they should
1370400	1374480	have been more considerate of the boundaries of that discussion, particularly when they appear to
1374480	1378720	be trying to connect with that audience. I have a feeling that the whole discussion narrative
1378720	1383360	was conjured up when they realised that they had some pretty severe incoming criticism,
1383360	1388240	maybe that's just my more cynical side talking. Another prominent couple of sensitive scenes that
1388240	1392960	are shown include two sexual assault scenes, one of which where the main protagonist is a victim,
1392960	1398160	one where she is witness. Both of these are perpetuated by Bryce, the main antagonist,
1398160	1402560	and probably one of the better written characters. He definitely captures the very two-sided nature
1402560	1407440	that a charismatic jock can portray, while still operating his power in very malicious ways.
1407440	1413040	These scenes will be upsetting to some, and that's important to note, and I do leave that disclaimer here.
1413040	1419200	I ragged on it a lot, but I actually don't dislike season one for what it was, I dislike season one
1419200	1423840	for what it claims to be. Generally, there's a lot that I liked in the show too, a lot of nice moments
1423840	1428240	which challenged perception. As said, any scene with the mother was genuinely riveting for me,
1428240	1432880	and Dylan Minnette does a pretty good job too, conveying a confused friend who doesn't know what
1432880	1439440	to do. As a show, I was entertained, I was taken in, but there is a clear narrative, a clear voice that
1439520	1443760	the show expects us to listen to, and without awareness, this can lead to shortfalls in the
1443760	1448640	representation of the realistic worldview that the show attempts to convey, and could help people
1448640	1454000	easily rationalise otherwise irrational actions that only make sense in the universe for the
1454000	1460480	writers of 13 Reasons Why Construct, playing into paranoia and mental clarity. This polarises the
1460480	1465600	debate, and makes Hannah seem like a vengeful psychopath to some, and like a martyr to others.
1465600	1470080	Neither are true, and yet the show seems to retreat from the idea of nuance and excusing
1470080	1475200	various shortfalls as inspiration for discourse, and that is the failure of season one.
1475200	1479520	However, I will say that there are some good discussions where it touches on the ambiguities,
1479520	1483600	there's this really good conversation between Clay and the school counsellor towards the end.
1483600	1487120	Clay- Just to imagine what Hannah's last days were.
1490320	1492960	Try to understand what led her there.
1493840	1497440	I cost a girl her life because I was afraid to love her.
1499440	1501440	You can't love someone back to life.
1504640	1505680	You can try.
1505680	1511120	And there are a few of these strong interactions that I do genuinely respect. Generally, I prefer
1511120	1516080	a Clay's journey than Hannah's, and I think not having Hannah's narrative spelling it out may have
1516080	1521440	created a better show, but there are only 13 tapes, and season two was around the corner. There was a
1522320	1525440	There was a lot they could change and improve on, were they?
1529840	1530640	No.
1544640	1549680	The source material for 13 reasons why the teen novel was all used for the first series.
1549680	1554080	This meant the creators had fewer boundaries holding them back, and combining them to perhaps
1554080	1558720	the trappings and shortfalls of such a premise. Would they squander this newfound freedom?
1558720	1562960	The answer is an affirmative yes, and its failure, I'd argue, is even worse.
1564320	1569040	By this point, they must have had the memo that they were starting a discussion, so their
1569040	1573920	contribution would at least be valued on those merits as well. Series 2 takes place with the
1573920	1578960	arch of the ongoing court battle between Hannah's mother and the school, whom she wishes to hold
1578960	1584320	accountable for her daughter's death. This time, each episode is based on the testimony of someone
1584320	1588560	related to Hannah, most of these individuals having been addressed on the tapes themselves.
1588560	1592560	It was a nifty little concept on paper, one of the biggest problems that immediately yielded
1592560	1597040	was that there was not nearly enough they could say, not as much as they would need to at least.
1597680	1602480	In 13 reasons why season 2, they repeat a lot of the trials and tribulations that the characters
1602480	1607040	in season 1 went through, leading to frustration at points. For example, the main protagonist,
1607040	1611280	Clay, has significant issues opening up. The arch of the first season provides the feeling
1611280	1616160	that it's good and healthy to open up sometimes a nice message, and holding these problems in
1616160	1620800	only leads to greater complications. In the second season, this problem repeats itself again,
1620800	1622320	which leads to similar discussions.
1637040	1644800	Now it's not out of the ordinary for someone's personal issues to resurface, however,
1644800	1649040	the feeling of relapse occurring was pretty depressing and frustrating for me to watch
1649040	1653520	personally. Clay repeats a lot of conflicts, and it becomes tiresome, it didn't really have much
1653520	1659760	to add within the themes during the season, so what did it add? Melodrama. A ton of melodrama,
1659760	1663600	there were people being beaten up, there were guns, there were knives, and at this point,
1663600	1667280	I felt I should be more annoyed, but at least they were making it obvious they were happy to
1667280	1672000	betray this narrative that this was a quote realistic high school environment, and I stress,
1672000	1676000	there probably are some high school environments that are rife with weapons, safety hazards,
1676000	1680640	and various other issues that shouldn't be ignored. However, the problem is, it doesn't work
1680640	1684640	for the premise, the brutality of certain high schools in America is reflected in various
1684640	1690000	socio-economic conditions that need to be in place in such a narrative too. There's no normalization
1690000	1694960	of violence in high school for 13 reasons why, particularly in the first season, it is treated
1694960	1699600	with the shock and horror, yet it happens on such a regular basis that you can't help but see it as
1699600	1703840	anything but forced conflict. Once again, to add weight to my point of rehearsed storylines,
1703840	1708160	the main cause of all this conflict is the fear that those who testify will incriminate some of
1708160	1712960	the worst individuals involved, which leads to various scares and sabotages, and the rest.
1713680	1718640	Because the thing is, in high school, everyone's watching you all the time.
1721520	1722640	You have to be careful.
1723680	1728320	Now the high school represented in 13 reasons why was never the most realistic, but it could isolate
1728320	1732000	the struggles that these students were going through, and at least allow you to connect with
1732000	1736080	them. That's not something that's really identifiable in the second season, there are some
1736080	1740160	things that have happened between the end of the first and the start of the second season that I
1740160	1744160	personally didn't like. Clay is now in a relationship with a character who was previously
1744160	1749040	not involved at all in the storyline, and therefore I just felt awkward watching it as I couldn't see
1749040	1753680	the chemistry develop. It was done for the purpose of creating a conflict that Clay keeps comparing
1753680	1757840	other females with Hannah, but it seems forced, and any interactions that arise from it are
1757840	1762000	extremely uncomfortable to sit through, because I could never really accept the premise that
1762000	1763280	these two people were a thing.
1764000	1778480	This relationship ends pretty quickly when she's taken away to a mental facility, but it underlines
1778480	1782800	another huge problem, which is just how easily people are emotionally provoked into hostile
1782800	1787520	confrontation. One of the characters who finds himself in confrontation is Mr Porter, whose
1787520	1791040	mild mannered counselling suddenly turns into high school vigilantism.
1811040	1814720	And although you could argue it's the mindset of someone who has nothing left to lose,
1814720	1819280	that sort of behaviour could completely compromise your testimony in court, and leads to nothing
1819280	1825120	being achieved other than another angry black man trope box ticked. I understand it's an emotional
1825120	1830320	time for people, but multiple people just seem so angry, entitled, and petulant. Probably the
1830320	1835200	worst example of this is the now recovering Alex, who following his failed suicide attempt will
1835200	1840480	just have the spontaneous outbursts out of nowhere. Now on one hand, I empathise with his trauma,
1840480	1844160	he has this memory loss, which actually isn't scientifically possible, but they're a bigger
1844160	1848880	fish to fry. His movement is impaired on one side of his body, and he's clearly suffering.
1848880	1853680	Because the writers use his outburst to make him seem antagonistic rather than tortured,
1853680	1855840	you end up feeling rather bitter towards him.
1870880	1877440	Often his eruptions are spontaneous, and they spend much more time focusing on his
1877440	1881840	emotional reactions rather than any discussion about what he might be going through. It doesn't
1881840	1886240	mean that those conversations don't exist, they are covered, but you don't really need more than
1886240	1891040	one of these angry moments to convey what he's experiencing. By the second and third time,
1891040	1896720	it feels awkward to watch, and so painful for the sake of confrontation. I don't think it does the
1896720	1901600	suffering of such conditions any justice, but with that said, he's far from the individual
1901600	1906640	who's suffering the worst treatment of their mental health here. I think that award goes to Clay Jensen.
1912240	1916800	As I said earlier, the tapes are over, you can't rewrite what was recorded, and it'd be hard to
1916800	1922080	revive the character of Hannah Baker now that she is deceased. I guess what I should say is that it'd
1922080	1928160	be hard to revive the character of Hannah Baker in a decent, respectful way, because they revive her,
1928160	1933920	but my god. In the first season, Clay has visions of Hannah here and there, and you know seeing her
1933920	1938720	face in other people and so on was understandable, given that he was clearly shaken by the ordeal.
1938720	1943520	However, by the second season, she begins to talk and have full on conversations with Clay.
1943520	1947920	On concept, this could represent an internal monologue between a person who is rather torn on
1947920	1951680	the right thing to do, but the writers make it very clear that they do not want it to be
1951680	1953040	interpreted that way.
1972320	1978160	So this left me with two options, either Hannah has come back as a ghost, or Clay Jensen's visions of
1978160	1982640	Hannah now talk to him. Neither of these options are particularly desirable to me, but given the
1982640	1986640	fact that ghosts would not be thematically congruent with the outlook the show is going for,
1986640	1991680	and mental health seems to be the focus, I'm going to take a guess and say it is the fact that Clay's
1991680	1997280	visions are worsening. This could also be proven due to the fact that Hannah often cannot answer
1997280	2001760	Clay's questions, even when the answer seems simple, thus suggesting she is a manifestation
2001760	2005840	of his own limited perception, while also providing more frustrating conversation.
2008160	2031600	Clay may be able to allege that this is a sign of schizophrenia in Clay, or something similar,
2031600	2036240	and I'd have to agree, and yet throughout the whole series, Clay just continues to live with this
2036240	2040960	apparition of Hannah, having continuous conversations, the writers acting as if it's just
2040960	2045680	nothing, as if he's just going along, it even escalates in exactly this way towards the end.
2045680	2049600	Clay's vision of Hannah becomes worse, probably drawn from the frustration that they have been
2049600	2054800	unable to obtain justice for the girls that Bryce has sexually assaulted. This vision of Hannah then
2054800	2064720	begins to repeat Bryce's take, the one which Hannah talks about her experience, and this causes him to
2064720	2070960	go to Bryce's house with the intent to shoot him, before turning the gun on himself. At this point,
2070960	2075280	the point should be, this is bad, and Clay needs help, and yet he's just escorted home,
2075280	2079840	and nothing, nothing at all is done about it, and okay, it can be difficult when we're suffering
2079840	2084240	from these illnesses to open up about them, but throughout the series, this apparition is presented
2084240	2089040	so passively that it never feels like the writers are even challenging you to think about it in that
2089040	2093440	way, other than the scene where she's literally screaming at him, she might as well be one of the
2093440	2098480	families, but okay, maybe I'd be a bit more forgiving if this is given an arc, and he confronts
2098480	2103920	this vision, or at least there's some closure, but it's so unbelievably insulting that it annoys me
2103920	2108720	just to speak about it. In the final episode of the series, they have Hannah's funeral,
2108720	2113520	Clay says a eulogy, it's a good eulogy for what it's worth, but at the end, we just see Hannah's
2113520	2118880	spirit exiting, as if that's the closure we deserve to such a tortured arc. The vision's now gone,
2118880	2124320	we can all be happy, hooray, and in a sense, that sort of closure worked with how they presented
2124320	2129040	her, but she shouldn't have been presented in that way, with so little awareness to what she
2129040	2133600	represented in Clay's mind. If you're not distracted by how poorly Hannah is written,
2133600	2139040	you're pissed off that this is a concept they thought was just asceptible to present as this
2139040	2143840	thing. This was a problem, and I don't think it should be downplayed. Another person whose
2143840	2149600	mentality is just completely butchered is Tyler, now Tyler being the creep who photographed Hannah,
2149600	2154480	is pretty much ostracised from many of the main characters, and this isolation can be dangerous.
2154480	2158480	They definitely set the grounds for him as a volatile character, and in this season,
2158480	2163680	he finds belonging with individuals who like him are social outcasts, he partakes in various
2163680	2168640	rebellious behaviours which detail him attacking the social hierarchy in the school through
2168640	2174000	vandalism and the rest. Now this quickly goes downhill, as he doesn't really understand how
2174000	2178480	to fit in properly, and mistakes edge for cruelty, and eventually falls out of place with those
2178480	2183200	friends too. Now I could talk about how clumsily that is handled, and how his actions don't really
2183200	2188160	make sense, but let's give him the benefit of the doubt on that basis and say, ok, he is socially
2188160	2197200	awkward, they don't have to make sense. So after being distanced from this group, he posts
2197200	2201920	incriminating photos detailing his involvement in the vandalism of school premises, he is
2201920	2207440	reprimanded by the headmaster, and disciplined accordingly, or at least how they feel is accordingly.
2207440	2212560	Now up to a point, I could see how someone's isolation leading to apathy could drive destructive
2212560	2216960	thoughts, and it's even shown subtly in some scenes, such as the one where he shoots a crow,
2216960	2218560	and has an interesting reaction.
2218560	2247040	For those who are unaware, Tyler is meant to be the school
2247040	2251680	shooter kid, and in certain episodes, they're trying to outline his sensitivity to the possible
2251680	2256400	radicalisation that such environments might produce. It's a hard line to walk, because as
2256400	2260320	always, you don't want to make the school shooter narrative seem too rational, you need to portray
2260320	2264800	him as an outlier, but you have to make it real. However, probably high off the backlash they
2264800	2268880	received for making it too rational in the first series, the writers go in totally the opposite
2268880	2273440	direction, and make his turn seem prompted by a scene that I'm going to have to describe.
2274320	2278480	Part of his discipline for the vandalism incurred him going on a correctional course,
2278480	2283680	he goes away for a certain amount of time, and seems to come back as a changed man. However,
2283680	2288080	on the first day back, a character known as Monty, who is known for being aggressive,
2288080	2294080	violently attacks him with his goons in the toilet, before ramming a mop stick up his anus,
2294080	2299040	and this upsets him so much that by the evening he's just off to shoot up the school dance.
2299040	2304160	The scene upset me a lot, to be fair, mainly because I felt it was unnecessary. Not only
2304160	2308080	do they really fail to document the gradual descent that many people in these scenarios
2308080	2313520	go through, but they have to include a really ham-fisted scene that was basically used as
2313520	2324720	a vehicle to justify why he did what he did, and the misrepresentation doesn't stop there.
2329040	2338720	Now, although it was a great misrepresentation, it was the perfect representation for what the
2338720	2343360	show had become, a show that viewed sensitive issues as a pit stop rather than a natural
2343360	2348720	source of discussion. It felt lazy, it felt exploitive, and it doesn't seem to understand
2348720	2353520	how to initiate that conversation it seems to care about. Giving someone basic information,
2353520	2358800	or just showing them a really sensitive scene isn't enough to start a conversation. If I tell
2358800	2363200	someone that the square root of 64 is 8 and then ask them to solve the hodge conjecture,
2363200	2367120	it doesn't mean I've sufficiently informed or equipped them to have that discussion.
2367120	2371200	These scenes are the sort of thing that will shock someone, and not necessarily give them
2371200	2375120	much to say, I don't know how I was meant to respond to that scene. The scenes just
2375120	2379600	discussed were the huge standouts for obvious reasons, and it's completely understandable,
2379600	2384080	they were done for the sole purpose of shock value. With the first season's suicide scene,
2384080	2387760	you could at least make the argument from an artistic perspective it had been built up
2387760	2392400	appropriately. With this said, in season 2, there were plenty of other scenes that were now added
2392400	2397040	in to embellish the timeline which just felt frankly inappropriate. Most of these scenes
2397040	2401280	were around the basis of Hannah, as shown by various testimonials. In the first season,
2401280	2405440	the tapes were presented as a nearly wholly accurate representation of the environment
2405440	2409920	that Hannah was subjected to. The second season uses flashbacks to add various details,
2409920	2414880	which I suppose were meant to be twists, but all they did was throw into contention a lot
2414880	2420080	of testimonials in her first season. One of the worst examples of this is Zack. In the first
2420080	2424800	season, Hannah puts him on his tape for fairly minor reasons, but ultimately he was there for
2424800	2429200	the loneliness that he represented and caused her to feel through his own actions. However,
2429200	2433280	the second season creates this whole subplot where they were actually having some sort of
2433280	2438720	relationship which renders a lot of the original narrative for the first season presented pointless.
2438720	2442320	Also, quick side note, they say this about 2001 A Space Odyssey.
2458880	2463920	I don't know exactly what they were trying to say here, but don't. Just don't. The second season
2463920	2467680	felt like they were trying to fix the errors of the first season, but ultimately just ended up
2467680	2471920	creating more errors themselves, without the source material they tried to grip onto characters
2471920	2476560	who honestly didn't clearly have much else to them, so the writers just made them angrier,
2476560	2482160	more volatile, leading to more conflicts. But also them just creating these new situations
2482160	2486080	like they did with Zack, where individual testimonies reveal new information.
2487040	2498400	I assume they anticipated this, and tried to deflect it in the script here, but this is no
2498400	2503200	valid response. It's not about Hannah including everything about a person, it's about including
2503200	2507600	the relevant arguments for why a person led Hannah to take her own life, and this story paints Zack
2507600	2512080	like a completely different person to the one portrayed in the first season, and makes Hannah's
2512080	2525120	take basically redundant. Another one who does that is Bryce. They make it seem like she actually
2525120	2530000	had something with him, before revealing that she actually didn't, but she still spent some time
2530000	2534240	with him, so I guess it was meant to show that she actually isn't lying, but the fact that she
2534240	2539040	admitted certain details like these in her takes regardless wasn't a good look, it kind of ruins
2539040	2544480	the first season for me. It's like the prequel film that no one wanted, it's like Shrek 3 but
2544480	2549200	Prince Charming just keeps having flashbacks to Shrek 2. Don't try and fill in the gaps with
2549200	2554720	Shyamalan style twists, it's daft and unrealistic and only serves to sacrifice the character that
2554720	2560000	you presented in the first season. Speaking of character assassinations, in episode 10 there is
2560000	2564640	this character that I think everyone has forgotten, but I have not, because I was actually really
2564640	2569840	annoyed about it. This is Sarah, she is introduced at the end of episode 9, and is thrown in literally
2569840	2575040	the episode after as someone who has been a victim of Hannah's bullying at a previous school.
2584960	2589760	This character has no other introduction, and once again is used as a source for unnecessary
2589760	2594080	conflict, however arguably the most insulting element to her inclusion is that logically
2594080	2598960	speaking she wouldn't serve the purpose that the writers intended her to. Basically, she's there
2598960	2604880	to undermine Hannah's credibility as a victim, to accuse her of being a bully at a different school,
2604880	2609200	after all, if she was a bully at a different school, how could she be a victim at this one?
2609200	2614080	This may work if her credibility was actually on the chopping board, but there are already numerous
2614080	2619600	testimonies that say she was unfairly treated, even from people who misrepresented and attacked her.
2619600	2629840	It's important to remember that the question was whether the school had failed to protect her,
2629840	2634160	which was the point of the lawsuit, and if the prosecution lawyer had been more diligent,
2634160	2639600	he could have easily flipped this to say that the school in that district, this other story of Sarah,
2639600	2645440	also failed to protect this individual against high school bullying and harassment. This whole
2645440	2651520	conflict changes nothing and only serves to fill out the 13 episode runtime, it was a stupid
2651520	2656240	diversion whose themes were never really explored regardless. I guess the point of the courtroom
2656240	2661040	was to try and illuminate how unjust many court decisions are, but their route of doing it was
2661040	2666480	to write out the school's attorney as antagonistically as possible and then have the decision
2666480	2667880	come out in their favour.
2667880	2670280	And isn't it true that your vandalism
2670280	2673240	caused thousands of dollars of damage to Zach Dempsey's car?
2673240	2676760	I was angry at him. I paid for the damage.
2676760	2679160	What did you do when you were angry at Courtney Crimson?
2679160	2681000	I just took her to Hannah's grave.
2681000	2682840	Are you responsible for Hannah's death?
2683720	2688040	Yes. There are kids who did a lot worse, kids who you let skate,
2688040	2691000	who did things that you won't even talk about, and adults at liberty-
2691000	2693160	Request to strike that answer as non-responsive.
2693160	2694120	So ordered.
2694120	2699880	Now I'm not saying that attorneys can't be this way, but it's simplistic and two dimensional.
2699880	2703880	At one point, Clay's mother was going to be the attorney representing the school, and although
2703880	2708280	I understand why her character would pull out due to the vested interest, it would have been
2708280	2713400	more interesting to see her battle with her own principals and her client's interests while still
2713400	2718040	trying to understand who's responsible. Instead, we have this very vindictive character who we're
2718040	2724040	basically told not to like. It's okay to challenge your audience sometimes, you know, the whole arc
2725000	2728600	of season 2 is utilised to tell the audience that we're meant to root for the school to lose,
2728600	2732040	and when they don't, we're meant to lament the injustice of the system.
2732040	2736360	But honestly, I'm not so sure about that. Let me elaborate.
2748200	2752760	As I understand, the court case is meant to indict the school as culpable in Hannah's suicide.
2752760	2757000	Now in the first season, this discussion and responsibility is kind of juggled between parties,
2757000	2761000	and the school environment is definitely brought up, and for what it's worth, there actually is
2761000	2764920	a discussion to be had. Hannah's parents are initiating the lawsuit against the school,
2764920	2769720	but it's also framed as an emotional decision and one done from people in exceptional grief,
2769720	2772840	trying to find a reason for why their daughter took her own life.
2783560	2801720	The school is presented as clumsy, shallow, and occasionally irresponsible, but never is it really
2801720	2806920	implied that the school had to pay for what they had done. It was a barrage of conflicting feelings
2806920	2811960	with no clear answer. In the second season, the show pulls out all the stops to make sure the
2811960	2816520	school is shown in the worst light possible artistically, while circumstantially trying
2816520	2821320	to present the situation as completely unjust, so there are fights, threats, and so on,
2821320	2825880	yet barely any of this is mentioned in court that could actually incriminate the school environment.
2825880	2829720	In fact, I believe the only person who does openly mention it is Jessica Davis.
2841960	2849960	If everything that happened in the school was reported in court, you might have a more
2849960	2854360	watertight case, but nothing really is reported, and we're meant to be angry when the court comes
2854360	2859160	to a decision that the school is not culpable, and after a while, I just reflected and felt that the
2859160	2863960	decision was completely reasonable. The first series asked questions about responsibility,
2863960	2868840	and the second series was just like, yep, that was the school. It doesn't help that honestly,
2868840	2873320	a lot of the questions from both the school and family attorneys were about individual
2873320	2877240	involvement, implying that this individual behaviour was accountable to the school.
2877240	2881640	Now of course, only one side was arguing this, but it essentially became an argument of tone
2881640	2886760	policing, the school was such massive pricks, like the principal for example, he's a big ol' prick.
2886760	2892280	The most dangerous thing would be to believe somehow that Hannah's suicide
2892280	2899880	is more than a tragic death. She's not a hero, she does not have lessons to teach us,
2899880	2907160	and we need to recognise the sad and simple truth that she is dead and gone forever.
2907160	2911480	These guys are so bad that we're meant to side with the good guys, but that's the thing,
2911480	2915800	it's one thing being right on the foundations of morals, but it's different when you're trying to
2915800	2920280	carry out a legal prosecution that implies there should be reimbursements, and implying that the
2920280	2925320	school didn't do its legal duty. It's a problem, and the question of how paternalistic schools
2925320	2930840	should be is complex, because taking matters into your own hands comes with its own consequences.
2930840	2935320	One might ask how involved parents should be in certain matters, and it was hard to prove how much
2935320	2940280	the school knew while doing nothing. In fact, in the first season, one of the most incriminating
2940280	2945320	factors such as the inscriptions inside the toilet cubicles was treated with shock, implying that
2945320	2948600	there was little knowledge, or at least little provable knowledge.
2948600	2950600	How have we never seen this before?
2950600	2956360	Oh, well, faculty is not supposed to be in a student's restroom, you know, in college and
2956360	2959160	tutorial staff to see if they could repaint these walls.
2959160	2964360	I don't like to side with the big bad institution, everyone knows how anti-establishment I am,
2964360	2969800	and make no mistake, as they are written to be, they are not good people, but being not good
2969800	2974920	people doesn't mean that you should lose a court case. I hate to sound nostalgic, but once again,
2974920	2979160	in the first scene, there's this really sharp conversation between Hannah's mother and Clay's
2979160	2983080	mother, who at the time was representing the school. I thought they'd make it some
2983080	2987240	moment to morally signal, but they completely subverted my expectations.
2987240	2992840	Would you settle for, say, $200,000?
2992840	2997560	I think I would only settle for the truth, whether I liked it or not.
2997560	3001320	That's the sort of thing that they were just not interested in doing in the second series.
3001320	3006200	In the first series, they tried too hard to make certain positions too justified, but in this one,
3006200	3011640	they just tried too hard to say, no, this is what we meant, and I like it less, and if they did it
3011640	3016200	with more attention to mental health, I'd probably be less likely to criticise them, at least it'd
3016200	3020280	be a bit more socially conscientious, but as mentioned earlier, they missed the mark on that
3020280	3026280	as well. It's the good guys, bad guys, TV drama trying to pass as a serious look on mental health,
3026280	3031240	and its mental health coverage is just bad. However, if we are to ignore the ridiculously
3031240	3036600	dramatic ending of the attempted school shooting, one moment that does manage to capture a bit more
3036600	3042440	realism is the sexual assault situation regarding Bryce, and how hard it is for many individuals to
3042440	3047240	come forward, particularly given their perception that someone like Bryce has due to his wealth and
3047240	3048440	prestigious family.
3062840	3067080	Throughout the series, he's presented as someone under pressure, but also very calculated in his
3067080	3071720	method to protect his reputation. He's an awful person who has raped multiple individuals, and yet
3071720	3076840	even when his victims go to the police, he only receives a minor sentence of three months probation,
3076840	3080920	and his former friend Justin, who is from a significantly less privileged background, ends up
3080920	3085560	receiving a six month sentence, despite the fact that his worst crime was being too intoxicated to
3085560	3090040	fully understand what Bryce was doing, and not being persistent enough. This was a somewhat
3090040	3094520	decent narrative on the failings of the legal system, and how it often comes out in favour of
3094520	3098840	those more privileged. There's also a good narrative about loyalty and the price of quote
3098840	3103320	betrayal, I would have much preferred them to focus on that rather than the prosecution of the school,
3103320	3108120	however I guess that wouldn't fill enough episodes. I think the one scene that I'd use to summarise the
3108120	3113880	tone of 13 reasons why season 2 is an alternative flashback scene for Mr Porter the school counsellor,
3113880	3118680	in all fairness, it's not a bad scene, in this reality he chases after Hannah as she leaves and
3118680	3124200	helps her open up, I kinda like it, but the context of it existing seems to be basically the writers
3124200	3129320	feeling insecure of how people may have interpreted that scene from last season, either defending Mr
3129320	3130680	Porter or attacking him.
3149640	3154200	If that scene had been the first season, I probably would have liked it a lot more, as it would have felt
3154200	3159880	more ambiguous. If season 1 says here's what you could think, season 2 says here's what you should
3159880	3165400	think, and I have to admit, I dislike the latter more on principle, there's nothing wrong with trying to
3165400	3170600	reel in the suicide is justifiable narrative, but they also go after a lot of other narratives too,
3170600	3176040	which to be honest, weren't necessarily inherently evil points of view, and compromise many of the
3176040	3180840	not so bad elements of season 1. They are scrambling to appease their complaints, but don't have a grip
3180840	3186600	on how to do it. Season 2 swaps out discourse for drama, and waters down any substantial elements
3186600	3191960	that may have given it its appeal in the first place, it is not mental health oriented, and commodifies
3191960	3198360	a high majority of those topics, that is the failure of season 2. But hey, we could talk about season 3,
3198360	3201000	they still have time to redeem themselves, so would they?
3201000	3201500	No.
3201500	3203080	Well thank you for that contribution, but I have a-
3203080	3207640	No, you've spoken enough now, we're like 5 hours in and you haven't even reached season 3.
3207640	3209480	I mean, that's what I was about to get into.
3209480	3215400	Yeah, well, I'm here now and it's my video, so we can't all be twats with too much free time, can we?
3215400	3217640	Now piss off and let me talk about this garbage fire.
3221000	3226600	The show is declining in quality so rapidly, I'm genuinely curious as to how and where it could
3226600	3232600	possibly go next. If nothing else, season 3 proves that there really is no rhyme or reason as to why
3232600	3238280	any of this story is unfolding, aside from the fact that it is recognizable, popular, and probably
3238280	3244840	boosts Netflix subscriptions. As if the fact that a show called 13 Reasons Why is already 39
3244840	3250360	episodes long wasn't comical enough. We're dealing with the aftermath of an event so distant at this
3250360	3255800	point that it's very difficult to justify why any of this is truly necessary, aside from the pure,
3256440	3262680	juicy drama of it all. Season 3 shifts gears in such a way that would be fine if it wasn't treated
3262680	3267240	like it's doing us some kind of virtuous service, as if this show is anything more than the
3267240	3272840	melodramatic high school drama aimed at young teenagers that it indeed is. In all honesty,
3272840	3277400	I kind of enjoy my yearly dose of this series due to the absurd levels they have to stretch
3277400	3282200	in order to keep this angsty snowball rolling. At the very least, I find it to be somewhat
3282200	3287240	comically entertaining as a trashy drama aimed at young adults, but I'm not sure that's the
3287240	3296200	kind of feedback the creators were hoping for. Okay then, if season 1 is about what led to the
3296200	3301720	end of Hannah Baker and season 2 is about the court case that preceded, then season 3 is simply
3301720	3306920	a whodunit murder mystery, with the hook or central question of the season being who killed...
3308920	3313320	All of the marketing was brandished with the question of who was responsible. Who did it?
3313320	3322600	Who killed Bryce? At this point in the show though, we're very aware of how evil Bryce
3322600	3327320	Walker is. He's so comically maniacal over the first two seasons that it's obvious he
3327320	3332840	was set up and marked as the major antagonist, and his comeuppance is the only narrative beat
3332840	3337400	that has any consequence besides the more pedantic pieces of drama that fill out the
3337400	3344680	minute-to-minute of the show. In order for this season to come together, the writers decided that
3344680	3350120	for this story to have any weight behind it, Bryce needed to come across as being more complicated and
3350920	3359000	well-rounded. So you felt more conflicted over his demise. Problem is, you ideally should have
3359000	3363240	been sowing those seeds since the beginning to avoid it coming across as retroactive and
3363240	3367400	kind of cheap. For a show that typically seems to have dealt in pretty clear absolutes,
3367400	3371720	it's very strange to me that three seasons in is when they suddenly feel inspired to add a
3371720	3375080	bit of grayness to the intentions of their more controversial characters.
3380600	3384600	Reminds me of the tropey writing something like The Walking Dead often falls into,
3384600	3388680	where a minor character suddenly gets an intense backstory that fleshes them out
3388680	3392280	mere moments before they're killed, so their death appears to have more impact.
3392280	3395400	With the way the show has been structured and written, it seems obvious to me that
3395400	3399720	everything after the original material has been composed backwards. They seem to have a
3399720	3404920	pre-prepared list of dramatic and controversial ideas that fit in line with what made the original
3404920	3411000	book so famous, or infamous, depending on who you ask, and instead of writing realistic people
3411000	3416680	that progress in a relatable and honest approach, they appear to force the square peg into a round
3416680	3422280	hole to continue to double down on this idea that 13 Reasons Why is on the cutting edge of
3422280	3424120	socio-political commentary.
3424280	3428840	I think it's mature and responsible storytelling on the part of Brian Yorkie and the writers.
3428840	3431880	I mean, to- to- it's courageous, too.
3431880	3434920	So how do they attempt to make you feel sympathy for a violent,
3434920	3440360	serial abuser fiend? Well, their answer was to hammer home this idea that at the end of it all,
3440360	3445720	despite the consistent and insistent amount of pure evil he has displayed in front of us,
3445720	3449800	the, come on guys, he's still a person at the end of the day, right?
3449800	3452440	He's a f***ing person, Clay. A human being.
3452440	3457640	One of the main themes of this season is this idea that parents and or family have a huge role
3457640	3462760	to play in shaping troubled lives. That behind broken or evil people is some kind of underlying
3462760	3468280	trauma, be it a fiercely homophobic father, a distant unloving mother, or whatever it may be,
3468280	3472120	which is an interesting idea to explore. There are a lot of movies I like that deal with these
3472120	3477640	very themes. However, the script here is far too hokey and silly to sell any of it.
3482840	3483960	Parent entering.
3485960	3489960	Let's not forget that at the start of season three, Bryce is known to us as the guy who
3489960	3494520	started the initial rumors about Hannah, viciously sexually assaulted a minimum of three different
3494520	3499320	people with more implied victims, started more nasty rumors, this time about Jessica,
3499320	3504440	tormented Zack by messing with Hannah's locker, lied while under oath countless times,
3504440	3508520	and probably many more horrendous acts I've forgotten about. Now, I don't know about you,
3508520	3513480	but I don't really think that Bryce could be properly redeemed as a character under any sense,
3513480	3518440	really, with what we've already seen him do. Like, this is very extreme. Like, what he did is
3518440	3530040	abhorrent. This guy is eviler than the fucking emperor. The only possible way I could see it
3530040	3535720	going down was, perhaps, in season three his arc was to come to the realization of what he'd done
3535720	3540600	and confess the truth to the police and take his punishment like a responsible person. Nah,
3540600	3544920	he wouldn't be forgiven, but that's the only real way I could see you taking this character in a
3544920	3550040	sympathetic direction and still maintaining some modicum of reasonable sense. It's true that
3550040	3554680	suddenly Bryce seems to have some kind of realization in season three about what he's done
3554680	3559240	and why it was bad. I assume they were going for a conflicted character who was fighting against
3559240	3563640	the evil instincts that had defined him for so many years, which we learn seems to originate
3563640	3567400	from a troubled family life growing up with parents that didn't love him properly. The
3567400	3572200	show abuses the idea that if you have a sad backstory, that automatically makes the concept
3572200	3577480	of evil deeds inherently more gray. However, as I already mentioned, it's looking for justification
3577480	3581240	after the fact instead of having some kind of plan for the character from the beginning.
3581240	3585640	Comes across that way anyway. Intentions aside, the execution of this character is where things
3585640	3591720	completely fall apart, all for the sake of this ridiculous murder mystery. Bryce follows through
3591720	3596280	on some of the more dastardly crimes yet in season three. A particular standout moment for
3596280	3601400	me being when he breaks into his dad's mansion to vandalize it, except it's revealed that he
3601400	3607800	went to the wrong house and winds up threatening a small child with a knife, like an actual deranged
3607800	3616200	sociopath. Well, I suppose he's only human.
3616840	3622840	Juxtapose that insanity against the attempts to humanize him and you wind up with some
3622840	3627480	brilliant unintentional comedy, such as when Bryce and his mother finally bond by throwing
3627480	3640360	paint on each other. This is without even mentioning the very intentional and petty
3640360	3644200	physical assault that Bryce commits in the penultimate episode. Story-wise,
3644200	3648040	this is for the character of Zack to have motivation to beat Bryce to a pulp,
3648040	3653080	so he can be a red herring for the real killer. But anyway, Bryce decides to plow his body at
3653080	3657960	full speed into Zack during the chaos of a riot that takes place in the middle of an American
3657960	3667960	football match in episode 12. This is, of course, fueled by pure jealousy because Zack moved in on
3667960	3674280	Bryce's ex-girlfriend, likely ruining any chance of Zack's sporting career permanently. Might as
3674280	3679160	well add a final destroyed life to the pile of chaos that this nasty character has left in his
3679160	3690440	wake. I mean, to be fair, he is only human. If that wasn't enough to prove how terrible this
3690440	3695160	character is, I went to the 13 Reasons Why wiki, which is hilarious by the way, where I noticed
3695160	3700200	some interesting, and pretty poorly written, observations. I find it very curious that for
3700200	3706120	a supposedly grey character, he has a dedicated section on his wiki listed as enemies, where most
3706120	3711720	of his crimes are conveniently listed in relation to the major characters. Oh god, wow, what a
3711720	3716760	horrible person. In the end, Bryce turned out to be a far more complicated character than people
3716760	3721000	first believed him to be. His crimes are inexcusable, but he did try to make up for
3721000	3727480	his crimes and seek some sort of redemption for what he has done. No he didn't. You're talking
3727480	3733400	about the same character who is listed under his personality section as a cruel, arrogant, spoiled,
3733400	3739320	manipulative, violent, and selfish person, and is a very dangerous individual. That sounds like a
3739320	3743560	more accurate description to me. It doesn't matter to me how many times he has a paint fight with his
3743560	3749240	mother, apologises to his victims, has a weird relationship with his dad, has a go at his meanie
3749240	3753880	grandfather, or complains about the world, not allowing him to change.
3757080	3761000	If anything, with the way it's presented, he comes across as a fairly consistent liar,
3761000	3765160	who is never truly being genuine because as the viewer, we get to see that he really hasn't
3765160	3769800	changed at all. It's even revealed that he's managed to fool multiple therapists.
3770760	3779720	As well as being responsible for having Tony's entire family get deported.
3789800	3792760	That's most of what bothered me about this character in this season,
3792760	3797560	aside from one important detail I guess. That being his relation to a new member of the cast.
3801880	3807960	Annie, or Lil Annie as I like to call her, is arguably the protagonist of season three,
3807960	3812840	which is a strange decision for multiple reasons. She is essential to the structure of the season,
3812840	3818040	with her narration being framed as a recounting to the police of the full murder mystery story,
3818040	3822520	as you later find out. I don't really understand why it was necessary to add yet another person
3822520	3827400	to this already huge cast, aside from the need to have a vessel that everyone can dump exposition
3827400	3832280	onto and over explain everything, as well as being a new face to have in a love triangle between
3832280	3837080	Clay and Bryce. Yeah, there are so many love triangles it's hard to keep track. Lil Annie is
3837080	3841240	written as an irritating know-it-all, who loves the sound of her own voice and miraculously
3841240	3845960	instantly connects with everyone that she meets, as a weak writing trick designed around shortcutting
3845960	3849720	the need to have her relationships progress in a more believable manner.
3852600	3856280	She's a blank slate who is used to second guess and constantly question everyone
3856280	3858520	to keep them spouting the awful dialogue.
3864200	3868040	Oh my god, it is bad. She's also got a British accent for some reason,
3868040	3872840	which I hate because I obviously- I hate British people and their stupid accents.
3874840	3879480	She quickly gets dangerously entangled in the entire affair, forming a strange relationship
3879480	3886600	with Bryce and sleeping with him multiple times. It doesn't make her a very likeable character,
3886600	3890440	but at least she knows by the end it was an extremely immoral thing to do.
3892680	3896520	Yes, it was the worst thing you've ever done. She's the most proactive character in terms of
3896520	3900440	moving the mystery of the plot along, with her motivation being that she wants to find out who
3900440	3904920	murdered Bryce because of her intimate involvement with him. I find it odd that they insisted on her
3904920	3910520	being the lead detective of the story, instead of the literal policeman- sorry, police officer,
3910520	3914920	who has been established, I think since the beginning, multiple seasons. Turns out he's
3914920	3920600	the father of the murderer too, so that would be inherent added drama, but I suppose that would
3920600	3922760	distract from the high school tween nonsense.
3922760	3924760	We will get you whatever help you need, Justin.
3926040	3927560	Oh, spoilers.
3927560	3935800	I decided to lump these characters together for a couple of reasons.
3935800	3939720	First of all, as if one love triangle wasn't enough, they needed to have a pesky little
3939720	3943880	cheating side quest going on in the background, with Jessica juggling a relationship with the
3943880	3947960	two fellas at once to add to the theater of it all. I already spoiled it, but it's revealed
3947960	3952680	that technically Alex is the one who deals the final blow to Bryce, so he gets credit for the
3952680	3956760	kill. It's fine though, because they agree to frame another character I haven't mentioned yet,
3956760	3958840	Monty. We'll get to him later though.
3958840	3959960	You're a crazy bitch.
3960920	3963160	Yeah, and you should fear that.
3966200	3970440	The murder scene is a complete mess because of the shift Bryce goes through depending on
3970440	3974600	what is convenient at the time to the script, but first he tries to make a case that he's
3974600	3979080	trying to change and that the world won't let him, even though he's- he's hasn't really done
3979080	3984040	anything aside from continue to be evil. Even going as far as to have made a confession tape
3984040	3988600	to give to people instead of just telling the police, why would you do that? However,
3988600	3994120	the moment he's helped up by Alex, he says he's going to destroy Zack and break his other knee,
3997320	4001480	which you might justify as him being angry in the heat of the moment. He did get his ass kicked
4001480	4007480	after all. But to me, it comes across as if his true nature is to be a violent maniac,
4007480	4013480	as we've seen for three seasons. Either way, Alex kills him and they cover it up. The characters
4013480	4017800	are covering up murders at this point. The main cast is so morally bankrupt at this point that
4017800	4022280	I'm pretty sure there isn't a single one of them that doesn't belong in jail for the seriousness
4022280	4027480	of their crimes. I suppose you could make a case for some of them before people were being beaten
4027480	4033000	and murdered and hiding weapons so the police don't find out- what the- what is going on?
4033000	4035240	Is that where you guys dumped Tyler's guns?
4035240	4035800	Correct.
4035800	4039160	But it's hard to root for these characters considering the lengths they're willing to go
4039160	4042920	to lie and cover up the truth of what really happened. They appear to make up their own
4042920	4047320	moral code as they go along and take the law into their own hands, which would be fine if
4047320	4052280	this show was treated for what it is and not sold as if it's this important learning tool
4052280	4055240	for young people to start having a conversation.
4055240	4058440	The show, which obviously is a weighty and important show-
4058440	4062680	Justin doesn't particularly get up to much this season aside from dealing drugs from
4062680	4066840	the 13 Reasons Why coffee shop they're all obsessed with. I suppose this and any other
4066840	4070600	show would be quite a big deal, but that's a relatively tame story beat compared to
4070600	4074440	everything else that's going on. We're told that Justin has an intense bond with Clay
4074440	4078760	as he was adopted into the Jensen family last season, but I can't help but wonder why Justin
4078760	4082120	wasn't used more in the investigation side of the mystery. It would have made a lot more
4082120	4086200	sense to me to have Justin and Clay team up to find out the truth of what happened. It's
4086200	4090040	not like a lack of motivation would be an issue seeing as they both have fairly intimate
4090040	4094040	backstories with Bryce at this point. I suppose we always have next season to explore the
4094040	4095960	sexual tension of Justin and Clay.
4096680	4101640	I'd do anything for you. Anything. Same.
4104840	4110120	This character cannot seem to catch a break. His first love killed herself, one lover had
4110120	4115880	a bipolar breakdown and changed school, and his latest fling chose a serial sex offender
4115880	4120280	over him. But that's not to say that this character is particularly likable otherwise.
4120280	4124280	I have no issues with the actor, I don't blame him at all. In fact, the actors are probably
4124280	4128280	the only reason anyone likes this show to begin with. However, Clay is so earnest and
4128280	4132040	trusting of everyone, to the point where I'm fairly sick of him and his bullshit.
4132760	4133260	What?
4135480	4140200	His character really started to crumble the moment he put himself in front of an armed
4140200	4145400	shooter in a misguided and dangerous attempt to be like a superhero like one of the comics
4145400	4146200	he loves so much.
4146920	4148920	You just ripped my favorite character to shreds.
4148920	4153080	At first I was disappointed that the ghost visions of Hannah that were prevalent in season
4153080	4158200	2 had subsided, seemingly for good. However, they had to have at least one scene where,
4158200	4162760	this time, Clay has a showdown with Ghost Brice, which I quite enjoyed.
4162760	4167480	I may be gone from this earth, but I will be reborn in the bodies of a million men.
4167480	4172680	My theory is that the next season is gonna be, in part anyway, about some kind of mental illness
4172680	4176840	that Clay is diagnosed with. My reasoning for this being that in one scene, his parents
4176840	4181000	question Justin in a way that seems to indicate they have reason to believe he has something
4181000	4183560	going on mentally. We'll have to wait and see on that one though.
4187880	4191880	Clay's main purpose in the story this season is to be another red herring. You're supposed
4191880	4195880	to believe that he was capable of being the one who murdered Brice. It even goes so far
4195880	4200200	at one point that he's the main suspect in the case and is actually arrested. I fail to feel
4200200	4204600	much sympathy for him though, because ultimately this entire situation could have been avoided
4204600	4209480	if he wasn't such a moron and kept secrets from everyone. This school shooter aspect has spiraled
4209480	4214600	the plot out of control so fast, all because of the way most of the characters agreed to cover for-
4218360	4223160	Season two obviously ended with the bombshell of Clay stopping Tyler from going Columbine,
4223160	4227640	so the results ripple into season three and have to be explained away with the most moronic
4227640	4231880	decision-making this group has made yet. Instead of getting this kid the help he clearly needs
4231880	4236600	and making sure he takes liability for his actions, they dividend responsibility between
4236600	4242200	the group and implicate themselves to make sure Tyler is never given a chance to snap again
4242200	4247880	and murder people. Yeah, that's their plan. Wow, these mental health expert children.
4247880	4250680	Most characters are deeply frightened of what he's capable of.
4255560	4258920	And Clay even admits that he has nightmares about being slaughtered by him.
4259080	4262280	In the dream, you pull the trigger.
4262280	4267000	Luckily though, Tyler is made out to be such a sweetheart to make sure to justify the ridiculous
4267000	4271160	actions of last season. They try to make the case that it was all worth it in the end,
4271160	4276120	that Clay made the right decision. Step in front of a shooter. Go on, that's clever,
4276120	4280120	because he's just a human after all. However, being the complete imbeciles that they are,
4280120	4285720	they decided to hide his bag of dangerous firearms in the water where fishermen constantly peruse,
4285720	4290120	so obviously the season ends with a tease of the guns being found, implying that part of next
4290120	4295480	season all sorts of drama is going to unfold. I'm glad, quite frankly, they deserve everything
4295480	4299960	that is coming to them. Most of the scenes with Tyler are him apologizing for nearly killing his
4299960	4305560	classmates and coming to terms with the horrendous abuse he received in the last episode of season 2
4305560	4306280	at the hands of...
4308760	4313160	Um, so yeah, Monty kind of steps in as the lead villain in Liberty.
4313160	4318120	This character is fairly similar to Bryce. He's not quite his mustache twirling, but they take his
4318120	4322200	character in a similar direction in terms of giving him a sad backstory, where it turns out
4322200	4327000	he's a closeted gay with a nasty father. His main role in the plot is to effectively be set up as
4327000	4330680	another red herring and eventually be the fall guy for Bryce's death.
4330680	4334360	Monty realized that the cycle had to be broken somehow.
4334360	4339000	So the others can get away with murder and cover it up. He also conveniently gets killed
4339000	4342520	off-screen, as we're told by the police that he was killed in jail.
4342520	4347400	But Montgomery De La Cruz was killed in his jail cell just hours ago.
4347400	4351160	I suppose you can have a crystal clear conscience, can't you, you monsters?
4351160	4352680	Okay, he was a human being.
4352680	4353960	Oh, gosh, shut your face.
4358040	4362040	This is the final character I briefly want to talk about because he's my personal favorite.
4362040	4365400	He's the only one who calls the group out on their idiotic decision-making.
4366360	4371720	This is bullshit. I'm out. I'm scared of you. And to be honest, I don't trust you.
4377880	4381640	We even see how kind he is to Bryce's ex-girlfriend in the fairly preachy
4381640	4385000	Planned Parenthood episode, which I haven't really talked about because...
4385000	4388360	I'm going to explain the procedure to you, and you will order some paper now,
4388360	4392040	and you will come back Saturday morning. When you return Saturday,
4392040	4393320	we will take your blood pressure.
4395400	4399800	That's most of what stood out about season three to me.
4399800	4402920	There's plenty of minutiae that could be talked about in more detail,
4402920	4406200	but honestly, I could be here forever talking about how bad this is.
4406200	4409400	As you can tell, and you'll especially know this if you've watched it yourself,
4409400	4412360	this is easily the messiest and most ridiculous season yet.
4412360	4415560	It so desperately wants to be taken seriously that it winds up becoming
4415560	4419320	even more of a parody of itself than the depths it sunk to in season two.
4419320	4423080	It's utterly tone-deaf, nothing about the production is particularly interesting
4423080	4426440	in terms of presentation, and even when they attempt something stylistic,
4426440	4427800	it falls flat on its face.
4427800	4430520	I'm of course talking about the ridiculous amounts of flashbacks
4430520	4433400	the show is structured around that have a slightly different color palette,
4433400	4436760	but the timeline is so muddled, it doesn't do much to help you understand
4436760	4439400	where and where a scene is supposed to be taking place.
4439400	4443320	The gross oversimplification of heavy subjects is as bad as ever,
4443320	4446520	shock value is appreciated over any real character arcs,
4446520	4449960	and the murder mystery angle is an extremely silly, pulpy beat
4449960	4452760	that only adds to the overall melodrama of the show.
4452760	4456760	Personally, I found it to be fairly enjoyable in a so-bad-that-it's-good kind of way,
4456760	4460120	mostly because of the shock of where the writers chose to take this season,
4460120	4462600	and I have to say I'm fairly excited for how they're going to
4462600	4464600	attempt to continue this mess of a story,
4464600	4466680	but this is no doubt the weakest season yet.
4466680	4469400	They've written themselves into such a corner by forcing the show
4469400	4471480	to go so far beyond its source material,
4471480	4473800	that at this point I'm curiously along for the ride,
4473800	4477560	purely for how they're going to try to keep this material weighty and important
4477560	4479800	while the stupidity continues to escalate.
4479800	4481960	I suppose they're the winners in the end, though.
4481960	4484840	They kept this conversation going for a bloody long video,
4484840	4488440	so I suppose that's the failure of 13 Reasons Why season 3.
4489000	4490040	It's really bad.
4490680	4493240	Thank you, I hate everything.
4493240	4495480	What a delightful appearance.
4495480	4497160	He truly is a loving person.
4497720	4499000	Let's finish this off, then.
4505880	4508680	If 13 Reasons Why was just about the first season,
4508680	4511560	we could have a fair discussion about how it treats its subjects,
4511560	4513880	where it comes through, and where it falls short.
4513880	4517880	By the time it's continuing to string along various audiences by two and three
4517880	4520360	with these narratives that are frankly rather worrying
4520360	4522040	when treated the way they have been,
4522040	4525000	it reaches a stage where one has to ask whether it's worth it.
4525640	4529400	With a full season on the horizon, I know there is not really much I can do.
4529400	4532520	From what I understand, it will be the final season of the show, thankfully,
4532520	4535880	but it seems mad to me that in the face of numerous critically acclaimed shows
4535880	4538840	being cancelled, this one has continued to steamroll through.
4538840	4541640	It sucks, because I do feel that everyone deserves better.
4541640	4545640	The cast deserves better, the topics deserve better, the audience deserves better.
4545640	4547800	I'm sure there are a lot of people who care about this,
4547800	4550680	but whoever's in charge just doesn't care enough,
4550680	4554200	or doesn't understand enough to make it seem like they care.
4554200	4557800	It's hard to make a show that has this discussion, I understand that.
4557800	4561240	You can't expect to put your foot in the right place all the time.
4561240	4564760	I know I couldn't, and there will undoubtedly be times where you deal with criticism
4564760	4568520	for the handling of something that people may feel has negative implications,
4568600	4570200	and that doesn't mean you're wrong,
4570200	4573560	it just means it's a sensitive topic that people feel strongly about.
4573560	4576600	However, with 13 Reasons Why, in each progressive season,
4576600	4579800	the creators seem to care less and less about the creation of narratives
4579800	4582840	that actually discuss these problems, and more just touching on them
4582840	4587320	for the sake of conflict through a provocative reaction, and that genuinely sucks.
4587320	4590120	It sucks that they can just put a little disclaimer at the start,
4590120	4593720	and think that they're sufficiently preparing people for what they're about to experience.
4593720	4597720	It's like putting an age rating on a game, who actually abides by that?
4597720	4601960	Difference is that this is mental health, and an assertion of realism in this world,
4601960	4606680	and a lot of games are more clearly defined on the bounds of reality and fantasy.
4606680	4611400	It doesn't change much, and it certainly doesn't change their failure to handle topics with nuance,
4611400	4615720	and the only real reason that it's continuing is because it indulges a certain audience
4615720	4619480	who is going to continue to commit to watching it, and I get it,
4619480	4623480	there aren't too many shows that have attempted to portray mental illness in teenagers,
4623480	4628040	though they're out there, but as many people have noted, this doesn't do it accurately,
4628040	4632600	and it misses out on one of the greatest elements, the element of getting help.
4632600	4636200	I would like to have seen a few scenes where a character has professional therapy,
4636200	4640120	talks over the problems they're encountering, the problem is that they never seek help,
4640120	4644840	and the fact that they try to talk about it with other students who are mentally volatile too
4644840	4648440	leads to this heightened conflict, and it might be good to create a plot,
4648440	4650600	but it's not really what you should be promoting.
4650600	4654120	There should be a point where characters like Clay Jensen are seeking help,
4654120	4657240	because by the third season, he is just painful to watch.
4657240	4660840	I hope at the actual end of the fourth and final season, he goes and gets help,
4660840	4665000	because I feel like the only reason they've been holding off that is to build conflict.
4665000	4668600	The school counselor is the closest they get to that solution, and even then,
4668600	4672760	the only character who really has an ongoing relationship is Tyler in the third season,
4672760	4675640	and most of those discussions are nice, but not that deep,
4675640	4679400	and the fact that it takes them three seasons to get there is kinda sad.
4679400	4682520	Also, they still never really frame it as a clear solution,
4682520	4684760	more just another plot element that's there,
4684760	4687720	but I guarantee if some of these characters took some time out,
4687720	4691240	they'd probably feel a lot better, but that's not what drives conflict.
4691240	4695000	If you're suffering from mental health difficulties, there may be solutions out there.
4695000	4697960	Not every solution works for everyone, I understand that,
4697960	4703080	but I don't think 13 Reasons Why is good for vulnerable people looking for a quote discussion.
4703080	4705880	Speaking as someone who has had his own mental problems,
4705880	4708520	the show left me extremely emotionally drained,
4708520	4711080	probably around the midpoint of the third season,
4711080	4714280	I felt at my lowest point mentally I had in months,
4714280	4716200	and I don't think that was a coincidence,
4716200	4719000	because everyone was just so unnecessarily angry,
4719000	4722040	the conflict grates on you, all that negative energy,
4722040	4724440	at the end you're almost relieved they resolved it,
4724440	4727080	but after being relieved, I felt conned,
4727080	4731480	they just forced a load of bullshit conflict and then resolved it to make me feel better.
4731480	4736200	It's like setting a building on fire, putting it out, and calling yourself the fire brigade.
4736840	4739320	They've had three seasons to get this right,
4739320	4742680	going by their baseball standards I'd say that's three strikes,
4742680	4745400	if you've watched it and it's changed your life for the better,
4745400	4747160	I cannot take that away from you,
4747160	4750040	but I think they've really failed to change a lot of people's lives,
4750040	4753640	and I'd be skeptical of how much they have helped the conversation.
4753640	4757320	If you're not doing great mentally, this show wouldn't receive my endorsements,
4757320	4761960	I think it's a placebo of sorts, and one that provokes a reaction that wears off rather quickly,
4761960	4765640	at this point I'd normally recommend a series that does handle it better,
4765640	4768200	but to be honest, I haven't really watched that many,
4768200	4772600	one that my friends always recommend is Bojack Horseman, which I definitely plan on watching soon,
4772600	4776360	though if any of my audience members would like to share some ideas of good shows
4776360	4778280	about mental health in the comments below,
4778280	4781160	then I'm sure there'd be people out there who'd love to hear them.
4781160	4785000	If you're doing mentally well, 13 reasons why I wouldn't get my endorsement either,
4785000	4788760	because seasons 2 and 3 especially just outright suck.
4788760	4793400	Overall conflict, contradictory values, and generally just what appears to be a motivation
4793400	4796200	to milk the discourse rather than actually contribute to it,
4796200	4801080	and the fact that it has persisted despite the criticism from people all over the creative
4801080	4806600	and medical spectrum is the failure of 13 reasons why we are done here.
4809480	4814280	So yeah, that was the video, a really really fun one, so much fun,
4814280	4820840	I had such a great time making it, and I hope that I can continue having a great, fantastic time,
4820840	4825480	I'd like to give a big shout out to the editors, they did a fantastic banger job,
4825480	4831320	fist bumps to all the editors, I don't know who you are yet, but I love you, I love you guys.
4831320	4836280	Shout out to my Patreons, my big old Patrons, oh Patrons, I used to call them Patreons,
4836280	4840280	but some people get annoyed that I call them Patreons, because I'm just trying to define them
4840280	4846520	from the regular Patreon, but I'll say Patron, so shout out to my Patrons, hey,
4846520	4851320	and all the ones that are $10 plus are on the screen right now, but we're not finished there,
4851320	4856200	we gotta give some more special shout outs, because I've got some big, big names,
4856200	4863480	I got a big shout out to Be More Cool J, what a cool dude, Brandon, Christopher Karras, Stanton,
4863480	4869960	all $100 Patreons, and they're my $50 Patreons, Caroline, Hypercube, and some Hullabaloo,
4869960	4875080	I did it in different order this week, you see I'm feeling extra spicy today, but thanks again guys,
4875080	4881560	you're all the best, you're all the dogs, and I appreciate and love you guys, so,
4881560	4888440	I don't really have much else to say, keep up the fantastic work, and if you wanna speak to me,
4888440	4892120	you can reach out to my Twitter, that's probably one I reply on the most, though I haven't been
4892120	4896600	getting to DMs too much recently, because I've been busy, probably that's the best shout,
4896600	4900840	Discord in the pinned comment, Facebook also in the pinned comment, though I haven't been using
4900840	4908600	that much recently, Instagram too, I sometimes chill on there, so, not too much else to add,
4908600	4917960	have a good week, I've given up with the world, but I'm still here, so take care, chaps,
4917960	4919960	all you fantastic chaps.
4930840	4932840	I'll see you guys in the next one.
