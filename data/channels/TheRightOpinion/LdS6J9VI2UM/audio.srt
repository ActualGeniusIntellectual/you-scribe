00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Hello and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of the twat with too much free time.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,960
And today we talk about the living wage.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,480
Recently this government has introduced a new living wage, which is lovely,

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,400
hooray, and everyone over 25 has to be paid at least 720,

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,440
which, you know, I don't really have too much to say about that.

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,720
Woah woah woah woah woah, but this video wasn't gonna be about that.

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,800
It's gonna be about certain companies and the rather disgusting responses

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,880
and why they are pretty unacceptable.

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,560
So a few weeks ago I was perusing through Change.org being the internet missionary I am,

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,280
and a petition caught my eye. It was this one.

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,880
Now, after reading a bit more in depth, this annoyed me.

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,380
A lot.

13
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,980
This undermined the whole principle of the living wage.

14
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,700
Some people were actually set to lose out on thousands.

15
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,700
Now the defence, obviously, of these large corporations is that,

16
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,700
as they're paying much more in wages,

17
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,220
this subsequently causes a sharp reduction in their general income.

18
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,020
So to counterbalance this supposed downturn in profits,

19
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,180
they have gone after the veteran supervisors and those who work unsociable hours.

20
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,500
Remind you of anyone?

21
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,340
I love a bit of it.

22
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,300
Let me tell you why this isn't a viable excuse.

23
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,860
It's time for a maths lesson.

24
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,900
Obviously, suitable reaction.

25
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,340
Disappointment, I hope.

26
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,060
It'll be fun.

27
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,580
I promise.

28
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,420
Alright, let's get to it.

29
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,980
I've pulled up data from the government website for the minimum wage over the last 10 years.

30
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,660
Now in 2006 the minimum wage was £5.35.

31
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,740
I also pulled up the data for inflation.

32
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,620
I calculated that £5.35 then would be the equivalent of £7.22 today.

33
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,740
Hardly any difference to the new £7.20 living wage.

34
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,660
Now you may say that this was just a one-off,

35
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:03,140
but this trend followed up until around 2011 when it began to slow.

36
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,740
I'm presuming to try and give companies increased leeway in profit margins

37
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,820
in an attempt to kick-start the economy

38
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,860
and try to test this theory of trickle-down economics.

39
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,420
However, this obviously had its downsides,

40
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,060
as it means that people on the lower end were making less money

41
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,940
and therefore they have less money to invest in local business.

42
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,900
And when I say invest, I just mean purchasing goods.

43
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,220
The government have consulted and come to the conclusion

44
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,460
that raising the minimum wage to its original projection will work more in their favour.

45
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,500
Listen, in business you have good years and you have bad years

46
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,180
and I understand the nature of trying to project your recent strong performances,

47
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,140
but you mustn't compromise the welfare of your employees,

48
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,700
especially those who have been most loyal and hard working.

49
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,100
If more people have more money in their pockets

50
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,140
it means that they're likely going to be buying more products.

51
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,860
That includes B&Q's products as well,

52
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,860
and many other companies who are concerned about losses in their earnings.

53
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,220
I often find that capital flows up more than it flows down,

54
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,460
and maybe that's what the government has found as well.

55
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,500
Now, B&Q aren't the only ones guilty of this.

56
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,660
Tesco's are also doing something very similar,

57
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,980
which also has a change.org petition.

58
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,140
I'll link both of them in the description below.

59
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,860
ZZ's are also taking money out of their staff's tips to compensate,

60
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,180
although I'm no fan of tipping,

61
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,340
the tips are for the waiters and waitresses,

62
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,180
not for the managing director.

63
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:20,820
The twat.

64
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,820
If we want to see an economy moving, we need revenue for everyone,

65
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,860
not just the rich.

66
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,540
They can only sell more products and make more profits

67
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,980
if more people have more money to buy those products with.

68
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,540
So, that was me, trying to be an economist.

69
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,620
Probably failed, but oh well, shit happens.

70
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,620
Like this channel.

71
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,220
Alright, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you on the next one.
