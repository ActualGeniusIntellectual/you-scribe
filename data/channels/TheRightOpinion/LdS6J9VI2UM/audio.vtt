Hello and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of the twat with too much free time.

00:04.320 --> 00:06.960
And today we talk about the living wage.

00:12.320 --> 00:16.480
Recently this government has introduced a new living wage, which is lovely,

00:16.480 --> 00:20.400
hooray, and everyone over 25 has to be paid at least 720,

00:20.400 --> 00:23.440
which, you know, I don't really have too much to say about that.

00:30.960 --> 00:34.720
Woah woah woah woah woah, but this video wasn't gonna be about that.

00:34.720 --> 00:38.800
It's gonna be about certain companies and the rather disgusting responses

00:38.800 --> 00:40.880
and why they are pretty unacceptable.

00:40.880 --> 00:46.560
So a few weeks ago I was perusing through Change.org being the internet missionary I am,

00:46.560 --> 00:49.280
and a petition caught my eye. It was this one.

00:53.280 --> 00:56.880
Now, after reading a bit more in depth, this annoyed me.

00:56.880 --> 00:57.380
A lot.

00:58.260 --> 01:00.980
This undermined the whole principle of the living wage.

01:00.980 --> 01:03.700
Some people were actually set to lose out on thousands.

01:03.700 --> 01:07.700
Now the defence, obviously, of these large corporations is that,

01:07.700 --> 01:09.700
as they're paying much more in wages,

01:09.700 --> 01:13.220
this subsequently causes a sharp reduction in their general income.

01:13.220 --> 01:16.020
So to counterbalance this supposed downturn in profits,

01:16.020 --> 01:20.180
they have gone after the veteran supervisors and those who work unsociable hours.

01:21.220 --> 01:22.500
Remind you of anyone?

01:22.500 --> 01:24.340
I love a bit of it.

01:24.340 --> 01:27.300
Let me tell you why this isn't a viable excuse.

01:28.100 --> 01:29.860
It's time for a maths lesson.

01:30.740 --> 01:32.900
Obviously, suitable reaction.

01:32.900 --> 01:34.340
Disappointment, I hope.

01:34.340 --> 01:35.060
It'll be fun.

01:35.940 --> 01:36.580
I promise.

01:37.300 --> 01:38.420
Alright, let's get to it.

01:39.060 --> 01:42.980
I've pulled up data from the government website for the minimum wage over the last 10 years.

01:42.980 --> 01:46.660
Now in 2006 the minimum wage was £5.35.

01:46.660 --> 01:48.740
I also pulled up the data for inflation.

01:48.740 --> 01:53.620
I calculated that £5.35 then would be the equivalent of £7.22 today.

01:53.620 --> 01:56.740
Hardly any difference to the new £7.20 living wage.

01:56.740 --> 01:58.660
Now you may say that this was just a one-off,

01:58.660 --> 02:03.140
but this trend followed up until around 2011 when it began to slow.

02:03.140 --> 02:06.740
I'm presuming to try and give companies increased leeway in profit margins

02:06.740 --> 02:08.820
in an attempt to kick-start the economy

02:08.820 --> 02:11.860
and try to test this theory of trickle-down economics.

02:11.860 --> 02:14.420
However, this obviously had its downsides,

02:14.420 --> 02:17.060
as it means that people on the lower end were making less money

02:17.060 --> 02:19.940
and therefore they have less money to invest in local business.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.900
And when I say invest, I just mean purchasing goods.

02:22.900 --> 02:25.220
The government have consulted and come to the conclusion

02:25.220 --> 02:29.460
that raising the minimum wage to its original projection will work more in their favour.

02:29.460 --> 02:32.500
Listen, in business you have good years and you have bad years

02:32.500 --> 02:36.180
and I understand the nature of trying to project your recent strong performances,

02:36.180 --> 02:39.140
but you mustn't compromise the welfare of your employees,

02:39.140 --> 02:41.700
especially those who have been most loyal and hard working.

02:41.700 --> 02:44.100
If more people have more money in their pockets

02:44.100 --> 02:47.140
it means that they're likely going to be buying more products.

02:47.140 --> 02:49.860
That includes B&Q's products as well,

02:49.860 --> 02:53.860
and many other companies who are concerned about losses in their earnings.

02:53.860 --> 02:57.220
I often find that capital flows up more than it flows down,

02:57.220 --> 02:59.460
and maybe that's what the government has found as well.

03:00.020 --> 03:02.500
Now, B&Q aren't the only ones guilty of this.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.660
Tesco's are also doing something very similar,

03:04.660 --> 03:06.980
which also has a change.org petition.

03:06.980 --> 03:09.140
I'll link both of them in the description below.

03:10.020 --> 03:13.860
ZZ's are also taking money out of their staff's tips to compensate,

03:14.420 --> 03:16.180
although I'm no fan of tipping,

03:16.180 --> 03:18.340
the tips are for the waiters and waitresses,

03:18.340 --> 03:20.180
not for the managing director.

03:20.180 --> 03:20.820
The twat.

03:21.540 --> 03:24.820
If we want to see an economy moving, we need revenue for everyone,

03:24.820 --> 03:25.860
not just the rich.

03:25.860 --> 03:29.540
They can only sell more products and make more profits

03:29.540 --> 03:32.980
if more people have more money to buy those products with.

03:36.820 --> 03:41.540
So, that was me, trying to be an economist.

03:42.500 --> 03:45.620
Probably failed, but oh well, shit happens.

03:46.740 --> 03:47.620
Like this channel.

03:48.500 --> 03:53.220
Alright, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you on the next one.
