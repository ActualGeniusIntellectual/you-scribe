0	4320	Hello and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of the twat with too much free time.
4320	6960	And today we talk about the living wage.
12320	16480	Recently this government has introduced a new living wage, which is lovely,
16480	20400	hooray, and everyone over 25 has to be paid at least 720,
20400	23440	which, you know, I don't really have too much to say about that.
30960	34720	Woah woah woah woah woah, but this video wasn't gonna be about that.
34720	38800	It's gonna be about certain companies and the rather disgusting responses
38800	40880	and why they are pretty unacceptable.
40880	46560	So a few weeks ago I was perusing through Change.org being the internet missionary I am,
46560	49280	and a petition caught my eye. It was this one.
53280	56880	Now, after reading a bit more in depth, this annoyed me.
56880	57380	A lot.
58260	60980	This undermined the whole principle of the living wage.
60980	63700	Some people were actually set to lose out on thousands.
63700	67700	Now the defence, obviously, of these large corporations is that,
67700	69700	as they're paying much more in wages,
69700	73220	this subsequently causes a sharp reduction in their general income.
73220	76020	So to counterbalance this supposed downturn in profits,
76020	80180	they have gone after the veteran supervisors and those who work unsociable hours.
81220	82500	Remind you of anyone?
82500	84340	I love a bit of it.
84340	87300	Let me tell you why this isn't a viable excuse.
88100	89860	It's time for a maths lesson.
90740	92900	Obviously, suitable reaction.
92900	94340	Disappointment, I hope.
94340	95060	It'll be fun.
95940	96580	I promise.
97300	98420	Alright, let's get to it.
99060	102980	I've pulled up data from the government website for the minimum wage over the last 10 years.
102980	106660	Now in 2006 the minimum wage was £5.35.
106660	108740	I also pulled up the data for inflation.
108740	113620	I calculated that £5.35 then would be the equivalent of £7.22 today.
113620	116740	Hardly any difference to the new £7.20 living wage.
116740	118660	Now you may say that this was just a one-off,
118660	123140	but this trend followed up until around 2011 when it began to slow.
123140	126740	I'm presuming to try and give companies increased leeway in profit margins
126740	128820	in an attempt to kick-start the economy
128820	131860	and try to test this theory of trickle-down economics.
131860	134420	However, this obviously had its downsides,
134420	137060	as it means that people on the lower end were making less money
137060	139940	and therefore they have less money to invest in local business.
139940	142900	And when I say invest, I just mean purchasing goods.
142900	145220	The government have consulted and come to the conclusion
145220	149460	that raising the minimum wage to its original projection will work more in their favour.
149460	152500	Listen, in business you have good years and you have bad years
152500	156180	and I understand the nature of trying to project your recent strong performances,
156180	159140	but you mustn't compromise the welfare of your employees,
159140	161700	especially those who have been most loyal and hard working.
161700	164100	If more people have more money in their pockets
164100	167140	it means that they're likely going to be buying more products.
167140	169860	That includes B&Q's products as well,
169860	173860	and many other companies who are concerned about losses in their earnings.
173860	177220	I often find that capital flows up more than it flows down,
177220	179460	and maybe that's what the government has found as well.
180020	182500	Now, B&Q aren't the only ones guilty of this.
182500	184660	Tesco's are also doing something very similar,
184660	186980	which also has a change.org petition.
186980	189140	I'll link both of them in the description below.
190020	193860	ZZ's are also taking money out of their staff's tips to compensate,
194420	196180	although I'm no fan of tipping,
196180	198340	the tips are for the waiters and waitresses,
198340	200180	not for the managing director.
200180	200820	The twat.
201540	204820	If we want to see an economy moving, we need revenue for everyone,
204820	205860	not just the rich.
205860	209540	They can only sell more products and make more profits
209540	212980	if more people have more money to buy those products with.
216820	221540	So, that was me, trying to be an economist.
222500	225620	Probably failed, but oh well, shit happens.
226740	227620	Like this channel.
228500	233220	Alright, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you on the next one.
