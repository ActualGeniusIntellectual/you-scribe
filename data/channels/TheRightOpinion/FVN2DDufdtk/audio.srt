00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,200
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,300
And I thought we'd cover some drama that's a bit more recent, because, oh my, do we adore the drama.

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:21,200
Now, I've covered Twitch streamers before, and I'll cover Twitch streamers again, because they are an interesting set of people,

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,700
and in spite of the fact that many of them are collectivized into a category by commentators,

5
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,400
they are all at least somewhat distinguished in what they do.

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,600
In a video last year, I covered Zoe Burger, someone whose rise to meteoric stardom was paired with an equally catastrophic fall.

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,500
She was an absolute magnet of drama, and one of the more sexually suggestive characters out of that legion.

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,900
But at the same time, she was her own individual.

9
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:49,700
She was banned off Twitch, and mainly gained infamy for antics on YouTube and the subsequent drama that yielded.

10
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,700
On the other hand, we have female streamers who may well be considered attractive by their audience.

11
00:00:54,700 --> 00:01:00,800
I mean, who doesn't want to look their best on camera, but at the same time doesn't necessarily seek to exploit that.

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,200
And this is where we reach Pokimane.

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:10,400
Pokimane is someone who is established on both YouTube and Twitch, with over 2.5 million subscribers slash followers on each platform.

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,000
That's something which obviously cannot be ignored.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
She does some gaming, she does some reaction-based videos, but overall, as people go, she's not an individual who has received exceptional controversy.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,100
This is fairly typical for most genres with a fairly undemanding audience,

17
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,600
much less demanding than the ones who watch critical commentators like myself.

18
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,000
Most commentators also tend to have a list of people who are controversial and easy to make videos on.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,900
This is a rotating list of people, including RiceGums, The Pools, Morgz, KSI, Deji,

20
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,200
so maybe some of the beauty community now, maybe throw in Emma Chamberlain too.

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,400
Maybe you like making thought pieces on who the next content cop is gonna be on,

22
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,000
or even if there will be a new content cop at all.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,500
What this means is that although people will be doing shady or at least debatable actions,

24
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,400
if people aren't focusing on them, then it'll probably pass under the radar,

25
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:07,200
and a lot of creators, including the person we're going to discuss today, have been sheltered from that sort of environment until now.

26
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,000
However, as spoken in the past, the alienation of drama can often mean that when it eventually does confront one of these people,

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,400
it means they are way out of their depth with no idea of how to actually handle it.

28
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,400
Generally, this has meant that in the history of Twitch streamers versus commentators, the Twitch streamers tend to lose.

29
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,000
Looking back to Pyrocynical versus Zoe Burger, PewDiePie versus Alinity,

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,200
and yes, in both of those situations, for example,

31
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,100
it's fairly reasonable to argue that you could side with Pyrocynical and PewDiePie in those situations regardless of outcome.

32
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:45,000
But as much as the circumstance does comprise the drama, the handling and the presentation are equally important.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,500
Another real problem is how a lot of this drama can often be perceived.

34
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,100
Expose videos have been monopolized recently by the commentary genre,

35
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:57,200
and so attempting to make any sort of response to them is the equivalent of going to play an away match.

36
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,400
You're entering someone else's stadium and you'll be attracting their audience, even if you're responding on your own channel.

37
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,300
One of the problems with a lot of drama is that it always feels like an us versus them situation.

38
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,800
You really are expected to side with one of the people involved,

39
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,700
but sometimes there is a clear moral high ground when it comes to these claims.

40
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,300
But often, when there isn't, we have to look a bit more closer than many people choose to.

41
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,700
The thing about drama is that whatever it yields, it can be assumed as some sort of moral standard,

42
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,800
even though we often forget about the conclusions we make and just contradict ourselves in the future.

43
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,500
I'm a man who does enjoy some consistency,

44
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,200
some,

45
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,000
because whatever disputes occur do have reputational legacies,

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,700
and it's important that we're holding people to account, but not unfairly singling them out because of some subconscious bias.

47
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,700
So let's talk about today's situation.

48
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:54,300
On the 28th of December, a very small YouTuber by the name of Fainted released a video called The Dark Side of Pokimane,

49
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,900
in which he alleged that while the public's back was turned, Pokimane had done some pretty shady stuff.

50
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:05,400
I'll be breaking down the details in a moment, but like some of the most infamous streamers in the past,

51
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,700
some of the main claims were on the notion of copyright striking, or as many people now like to call it, copy striking.

52
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:16,200
Firstly, in the incident of a series of uploaded Twitter clips on a feud between her and Keemstar,

53
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,900
and secondly, on a channel that re-uploaded stream clips of her known as Davsep.

54
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:27,400
These are both fairly separate situations, but fell under the umbrella of criticism that Pokimane was facing down.

55
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,700
When he uploaded a video, Fainted had a few hundred subscribers,

56
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,700
but the video blew up and he's in a quite different position, it's safe to say.

57
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,800
Everyone loves a good old success story.

58
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,700
On top of this, Fainted's video contained multiple allegations of hypocrisy,

59
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:46,700
particularly implied through the situation in which Pokimane criticized Keemstar for allegedly bullying a fan,

60
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:53,500
promoting a principle that many claimed was contradicted by her behaviour towards the subjects of Fainted's video.

61
00:04:53,500 --> 00:05:00,100
Then a couple weeks later, on the 11th of January, PewDiePie uploaded a video with the classic title Stop Doing This,

62
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,300
in which he requested a host of YouTubers to, well, stop doing this.

63
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:09,500
This being the unwarranted copyright striking of other videos that seemingly didn't deserve them.

64
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:15,000
In this list was the lady herself, Pokimane, and the fact that she had allegedly struck down the Twitter feud,

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,900
which, as pointed out by PewDiePie, had been picked up by the algorithms and were being publicized,

66
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,300
and Pokimane probably wanted to keep it out of the public eye.

67
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:30,200
However, this caused a classic Streisand effect and now has the platform's largest YouTuber covering it.

68
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,700
Well, we'll see how he's doing against T-Series by the time this video comes out.

69
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:38,900
So, clearly, with a lot of allegations staring herself down, Pokimane decided to make her response video,

70
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,300
in which she addressed some of the claims made against her.

71
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,900
She admits some of her transgressions, but also decides to hold her ground on some points,

72
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,600
particularly the situation regarding Davsev, which is an interesting one.

73
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,500
She also responds directly to both PewDiePie and Fainted, including clips of their videos,

74
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,600
which, of course, provokes an additional response from Fainted, which was mainly rebutting Pokimane's response,

75
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:06,300
and some of the points that she made, kind of concluding that Pokimane's response was insufficient in the scope of actually responding,

76
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,800
and more just a way to dodge and reframe a lot of what's going on.

77
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,500
But is that the case? Because, honestly, watching through Fainted's initial video, I wasn't really won over.

78
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,400
I thought it was a bit weak, but I can see why other people were won over.

79
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:27,000
Equally, I don't think that any of the conclusions, necessarily, that I've observed make Pokimane a bad person, per se,

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,400
but I still think she's made a huge mistake, and when your ratings are going badly, there's always a reason.

81
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,100
So today, I don't want this to be an exposed video, it's not,

82
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,400
but more a guide on why people might turn against you in the face of drama,

83
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,400
and how someone who has probably never dealt with it before can take it on in the future,

84
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,600
because, you know, that's what we do here on The Right Opinion.

85
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:06,600
One of the most contentious issues on the platform is that of fair use.

86
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,000
We have some sort of vague manga about the dos and the don'ts,

87
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,200
but when a situation that blurs the lines comes about, it often throws the community into chaos,

88
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,900
with no clear argument on what is actually right.

89
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,700
On top of this, it is a really passionate topic, people care a hell of a lot,

90
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,200
and if you're doing it unjustly, you are gonna have an uphill battle defending yourself.

91
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,900
This is the first situation that comes about with Pokimane,

92
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,300
because what happened, as both testified by her and fainted,

93
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,000
is basically Keemstar was on Twitter, had an argument with some fans of another creator,

94
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,100
the colourful character SSSniperWolf,

95
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:45,000
before Pokimane stepped into the fray to go toe-to-toe with Keem in a Twitter video battle.

96
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,100
But then a load of people contributed as well, and a load of memes,

97
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,400
and a load of people who I'm not familiar with, because I don't use this damn site enough.

98
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,800
Right... there.

99
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,400
This nigga's organisation is actually kind of on fleek.

100
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,600
The shadow's even, you can tell he's stacked up, even the angle fucking sucks.

101
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,100
And then right here.

102
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,000
This nigga's wires is in place.

103
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,200
Now, after a discussion, it was assumed to be over, and many people continued with their lives.

104
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,900
However, a compilation of this discussion was downloaded and re-uploaded onto YouTube,

105
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,800
and it clearly caught people's attention.

106
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,400
And because it caught people's attention, YouTube decided that it was going to blow the video up.

107
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,700
So suddenly this drama that Pokimane probably regretted involving herself in the first place,

108
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:35,300
was blowing up all over YouTube, and there was nothing she could do about it, or so people thought.

109
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,900
Because Pokimane decided to have her company, Omnia Media, remove the video,

110
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,100
and deal a claim onto the YouTuber known as Bowblax.

111
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,500
Now, most people believe he received a strike straight away,

112
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,700
but actually this was a miscommunication, and something that has been clarified recently through additional research.

113
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,600
However, even with that said, it did eventually turn into a strike due to the appeals,

114
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,600
and for anyone who doesn't know, a copyright strike has a significant effect on the mobility of a channel,

115
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,800
even if it's only one.

116
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,300
It causes a fair bit of stress, and takes a few months to expire.

117
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,300
So on one hand, you have Fainted and PewDiePie, who call out Pokimane for doing this,

118
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,500
of course it's annoying when something like this blows out of proportion,

119
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,800
but such a response is rather uncalled for.

120
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,200
So in a way, I can understand why you want to take down this video,

121
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:27,700
because this selected thing blows up and becomes even bigger, thanks to YouTube's system being kind of stupid.

122
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,600
At least I can somewhat understand the motivation of trying to take down that video.

123
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,400
But the problem here, and the same problem that goes with every single example that I brought up in this video,

124
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,000
is that you're just drawing more attention to it.

125
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,100
It's a Streisand effect every single time.

126
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,900
Pokimane responds to them saying that although she felt perfectly within legal right to remove the video,

127
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,700
she understands that it was a morally problematic decision to take.

128
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,900
Although I was legally within my right to take down the video, morally, and as a content creator,

129
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,900
it wasn't something that I should have done, because, I mean, at the end of the day,

130
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,100
those were tweets that me and Keem made publicly, and videos that we made publicly.

131
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:09,000
Fainted then disputes this using his commentary credentials by citing a Keemstar tweet.

132
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,200
And you know what, I'm not even gonna bother giving my opinions on this, we'll just leave that to the man himself, Keemstar.

133
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,000
Pokimane, I think you're confused on what transformative means.

134
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,800
The video where they played both our Twitter vids was transformative because it's a collage of multiple clips.

135
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,800
There's case law on this. It's not a direct upload, like you stated, you could get sued for false flagging.

136
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:31,200
This gave me the impression that he seemed to think that the video was fair use because it was in a compilation format.

137
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,300
And so I want to put this on hold for a moment, because I notice a problem in the reasoning.

138
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:41,500
Firstly, I think, contrary to my friend's belief here, that actually Pokimane was completely in her quote,

139
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:47,300
legal rights to remove the video, even though there is some sort of claim that this has been put to test in the courts.

140
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,100
I cannot find it, and I highly doubt a compilation of clips would be considered fair use,

141
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,500
considering some of the other cases, even if they're done in a way that shows a chronologically arranged discussion,

142
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,100
which could be considered part of the transformation.

143
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,900
Dealing with fair use is incredibly complicated, we know where the extremes lie,

144
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,200
we know that Chris Stutman's film reviews are almost certainly fair use,

145
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,100
and we know that re-uploads of Coldplay songs are most likely not fair use.

146
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,800
But a lot of the content falls in between, and therefore the only way to resolve this is through the courts.

147
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,800
Either way, fair use or not, I find this whole debacle to be a bit of a non-argument,

148
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,600
and if Pokimane was taken to court over this, I think she'd win.

149
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,800
But here's the thing, just because something is legally accepted doesn't mean we should accept it.

150
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,000
Laws are typically based off some sort of moral foundations,

151
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,800
and therefore when Pokimane accepted the regards of legality her move was morally dubious,

152
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,800
it should have technically invalidated her argument,

153
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,400
because generally we perceive ourselves on the basis of morality,

154
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,200
and therefore if she actively did something that she's aware was immoral,

155
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,200
then legality only exists as a technical defense to avoid being sued.

156
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,400
Just because something's legal does not make it moral,

157
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,400
and therefore means we shouldn't necessarily accept it.

158
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,600
Laws themselves exist for that reason.

159
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,800
For the betterment of society, what do we build the laws on?

160
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
We build those laws on principles.

161
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,600
Laws are partly built on morals, and we're always debating what should and should not be changed.

162
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,800
If you can't morally justify your actions, then the fact that it's legal does not serve as a defense,

163
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,600
other than, of course, in court.

164
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,800
But audiences are not jurors, they're just people who have opinions.

165
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,800
The thing is, that although I'm generally against re-uploaded content,

166
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:38,200
I feel that these circumstances make the situation much more of an archiving of a conversation that occurred.

167
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:43,800
Trying to mute what unfortunately happened and could have been archived any other way is where the issue lies,

168
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:49,800
and I don't think that was a reasonable action on her part, and I think me and her can agree there now.

169
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,000
And this is one other thing, she uses this term in a way that I would call a passive defense.

170
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,200
Basically, she doesn't run the point as if it's counter to her position on the situation,

171
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,800
or the point she's trying to make.

172
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,600
She still concedes, apologizes, and admits she was wrong, and fair play for that.

173
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,800
Although I was legally within my right to take down the video, morally, and as a content creator,

174
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,800
it wasn't something that I should have done, because, I mean, at the end of the day,

175
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,200
those were tweets that me and Keem made publicly, and videos that we made publicly,

176
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:24,200
so I totally apologize for that, and I spoke to the guy who made those videos, like, a few weeks back,

177
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,400
and we had resolved all of this in DMs.

178
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,800
However, because she made the point, Fainted can extract it and run against it,

179
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,400
and as a passive defense, her video really could have done without it.

180
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:39,900
A passive defense is only really utilized as a rhetorical device to demonstrate reasonability,

181
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,300
and I think that's what Poki was trying to do here.

182
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,300
The problem is that when you're defending yourself, a passive defense has to explain your mindset,

183
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,600
rather than necessarily justifying your ability to commit the action.

184
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,900
For example, I say,

185
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,600
I'm sorry for shouting at that lady.

186
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,900
I was drunk and depressed, but it was completely wrong on me.

187
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,700
Rather than,

188
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,600
I'm sorry for shouting at that lady.

189
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,800
I was, well, within my rights to do it, but it was completely wrong nonetheless.

190
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,600
Because it's a moral issue, the way I've worded the second explanation sounds like a scapegoat,

191
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,800
because it sounds like I've shifted part responsibility onto the legal system for allowing me to do it,

192
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,300
and that's where you have to be very careful on how it comes across.

193
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,900
I find Pokimane's response genuinely interesting,

194
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,000
because I think it's one of the first ones that clearly have the correct base formula down.

195
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,600
When responding to something that you know is wrong, it's important to admit your mistakes,

196
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,900
but at the same time, try to make sure the audience can empathize with the mindset you're in,

197
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,400
and she does appear to attempt that and lay that structure down,

198
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,300
but she just pulls the wrong points in.

199
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,800
There is a right way and a wrong way to justify yourself, and this tends to lean the wrong way.

200
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,800
This is a problem particularly evident throughout Pokimane's response.

201
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,300
The emphasis of her points do not reflect the points that are of interest to the audience.

202
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,400
Everything that might be relevant seems rather brushed over.

203
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,200
I don't think it's her intent, but it can come across as rather dismissive.

204
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,500
Equally, I don't think it's her intent to necessarily misframe the claims being made against her,

205
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,500
but...

206
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,500
Some people were saying that I pulled up his, like, personal Instagram and made fun of him or something.

207
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,800
So what she does is honestly pretty evil.

208
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,400
Poki finds Dabsev's personal Instagram page, and then just laughing at pictures of him.

209
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,400
He had his Instagram linked in the description of the videos that he was posting,

210
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,100
so it was not like a personal or private Instagram.

211
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,700
I didn't attack the way that he looked,

212
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,900
and obviously he was watching my stream while he was on the call with me,

213
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,900
and he saw that I was looking at his Instagram.

214
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,300
He said, do you like what you see?

215
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,800
Showing off all this stuff.

216
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,000
Yeah, I don't like people trying to make it seem like I would go to someone's Instagram with alien intent

217
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,700
just to, like, bash on them.

218
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,200
Hey, hold on a minute. What kind of cutting was that, bro?

219
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,200
She just completely cut up my point.

220
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,700
Poki finds Dabsev's personal Instagram page, and then just laughing at pictures of him.

221
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,100
Let me show you what it actually looked like,

222
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,400
and then you can probably guess why Pokimane didn't include that in her video.

223
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,200
Poki finds Dabsev's personal Instagram page,

224
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,300
and literally starts looking through it and laughing at it in front of thousands of viewers.

225
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,800
Problem here is that she's gone into it like a lot of public figures.

226
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,100
They come from a genre where optics and wording don't seem like a big deal,

227
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,100
and suddenly making vague statements,

228
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,300
it's fairly easy for a commentator like Fainted,

229
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,200
who I don't even rate as an argumentation expert.

230
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,800
You have to be specific.

231
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,600
You have to be clear with what you mean,

232
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,600
and you cannot misframe the situation to be disproportionately sympathetic to your case,

233
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,300
or disproportionately harsh against another person,

234
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,200
because there is nobody who will pick that up like the commentators.

235
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,000
I think this is a really important learning experience

236
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,400
that we should definitely take forward going into the second situation.

237
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,400
...

238
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
...

239
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
...

240
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400
...

241
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,400
...

242
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,400
...

243
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,400
...

244
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,800
Thing about the Dabsev situation is that if Pokimane had approached it correctly,

245
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,400
then she could have been in the clear.

246
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,000
This is the real pivotal situation that galvanised a lot of the drama,

247
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,700
and to completely apprehend how to respond,

248
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:15,100
she kinda had to understand exactly what people's objections were to the original scenario,

249
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,100
and once again, Fainted, on one hand, had a much harder sell.

250
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,500
Dabsev was clearly an annoying twat,

251
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:26,700
and frankly, people are not inclined to side with someone they may perceive as an annoying twat.

252
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,700
...

253
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,700
...

254
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,700
...

255
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,700
...

256
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,700
...

257
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,700
...

258
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,700
...

259
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,700
...

260
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,700
...

261
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,700
...

262
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,700
...

263
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,700
...

264
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,700
The thing Fainted very smartly did was not side with Dabsev.

265
00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:01,700
Not necessarily defending Dabsev, he knew that if Pokimane decided to try and couple him to Dabsev in any sort of way,

266
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,100
then he could object and point out the flaw in her argument,

267
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,100
because Pokimane didn't pay close enough attention to respond meticulously.

268
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,500
She makes some very vague claims and thus suffers because of them,

269
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,900
even though with better wording, she could have really put it to bed.

270
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,100
At this point in the discussion, I think everybody can agree that Pokimane is in the right here,

271
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,500
because of course, if this guy's proud of the fact that he's uploading clickbait videos,

272
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,300
it kind of tells us a lot about his character.

273
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:31,300
So if the video he's uploaded consists of literally just a stream clip nabbed from her livestream,

274
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,700
then in that case, I think she went 100% as the right to take down the video.

275
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,300
But because, once again, she focuses on one issue which she doesn't really respond to properly,

276
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,100
she first cuts Fainted's clip-up in a way that changes the message.

277
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,900
Now, whether she wanted to do that for efficiency or not is besides the point.

278
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,300
It came across as twisting information.

279
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:56,300
Equally, it's really important to not be distracted by the general representation of the points.

280
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:00,900
Fainted may be a smaller YouTuber, but right now, he is the one with the momentum,

281
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:06,300
and therefore, if you want to respond to him, you have to make sure his arguments are being communicated properly,

282
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,700
and that equally, you make sure there's no confusion.

283
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,300
For example, this earlier clip.

284
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:16,900
And people have been using clips from that livestream to try to make it look like I randomly take down videos whenever I want,

285
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,900
or I do that commonly when it's definitely not the case.

286
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,900
Right, so now Daddy Fainted's getting called out.

287
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,900
I'm pretty sure in my video, I never mentioned anything about her frequently taking down videos.

288
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,900
My video is focused on your hypocrisy.

289
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:34,700
Now, as noted, Fainted lays claim that this clip is about him, but Poki never actively says it is,

290
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:39,100
and there's fair evidence to assume that, from other YouTubers, this narrative isn't rare.

291
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,500
So it's very possible that Poki caught other videos or comments from people,

292
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,300
but because she put it in her title that she's responding to the dark side of Pokimane,

293
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:53,900
it implies that this is a narrative that is local to his video, even though it's not.

294
00:19:53,900 --> 00:20:01,700
It is actually a general narrative that is somewhat existent in other YouTubers who have made videos and got decent views.

295
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,500
Pokimane recently seems to be going around doing a lot of scummy things, pretty much.

296
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,300
She's striking out a bunch of smaller creators, she's making people cry in front of 20,000 people right on stream,

297
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,300
and she's honestly just, you know, a thought.

298
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:17,100
I want to put it out there that I never knowingly take down a video that is transformative content.

299
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:23,100
I would not take down videos that people have spent time, like, creating commentary for,

300
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,100
and editing and producing together, I don't think that's fair at all.

301
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,700
And obviously that's why there's tons of videos out there,

302
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,700
Twitch compilations where I'm still in them,

303
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,700
or critiques of me or drama,

304
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,700
or videos that I'm in that are positive or negative that I don't take down.

305
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,500
Now, I say this because she uses the phrase people.

306
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,500
Fainted is not people, Fainted is a person, as far as I know.

307
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:49,500
And I think we can deduce here that once again she's trying to address a different narrative being pushed by certain YouTubers.

308
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,500
The problem is when you put someone's video title in your title, it sounds like you're addressing them.

309
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:59,100
Fainted had no real right to lay claim to that comment other than that fact.

310
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:04,900
It would have been narcissistic to assume that his video was the only one that promoted a narrative like that.

311
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:10,700
Equally by addressing some narratives and overlooking others, it just seems like she's dancing around certain points,

312
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,900
and honestly she didn't really need to address Fainted at all,

313
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,300
especially when she only brings up the situation about how it's being framed.

314
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:24,100
And one of the biggest problems is when you bring up the question of optics and not just the direct situation,

315
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,700
it becomes very, very sketchy.

316
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,900
The only thing that she actively goes out of her way to address Fainted on is the Instagram situation,

317
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,700
and once again, if you can explain why you did this barely enough, easy picking.

318
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,500
You're pissed off that someone has taken your content, being an irritating bastard,

319
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,900
and so to elicit your perception of justice against this davsev twat,

320
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,500
you think that he deserves to get the piss taken out of him,

321
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,300
and so you go airing all your dirty laundry on the stream, and you admit that you went a bit too far,

322
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,700
and you know what? That's pretty much what she said,

323
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,300
and probably why Fainted doesn't bother addressing that part, because the majority of it is fairly agreeable.

324
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:01,100
The point of this is just to say that was an entirely different scenario and situation,

325
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,300
where I was well within my right to take down his content,

326
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,900
but also in that moment and on that live stream.

327
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,300
Like, I shouldn't have had that conversation on stream,

328
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,700
and it definitely was a moment of frustration.

329
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,100
That shouldn't have been, like, publicized in that way, for sure.

330
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,100
But then she ends up at this point.

331
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:24,100
He had his Instagram linked in the description of the videos that he was posting,

332
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,900
so it was not like a personal or private Instagram.

333
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,500
I didn't attack the way that he looked,

334
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,700
and obviously he was watching my stream while he was on the call with me,

335
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,700
and he saw that I was looking at his Instagram.

336
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,900
He said, do you like what you see?

337
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,900
And once again, we end up in a situation of how someone was allowed to do something,

338
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,900
the notion that she found his personal Instagram page,

339
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,700
because it was linked in the description.

340
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,500
And honestly, once again, her point is not wrong.

341
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,900
She can do what she wants.

342
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:54,300
The fact that Davsev is a YouTuber, an adult, putting content on a public platform,

343
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:58,300
and therefore any links he posts as public may be picked up by anyone.

344
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:04,100
But it sounds like Pokimane interpreted the point against her as if she was doxing someone,

345
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:08,100
rather than actually necessarily the point that Fainted was trying to make.

346
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,100
Okay, so this is the one part of the video that does kind of trigger me a little bit.

347
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:16,100
So in Pokimane's logic, just because Davsev had his Instagram linked on one of his Twitch compilations,

348
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,500
that gives her the right to display his Instagram in front of thousands of people on her Twitch stream,

349
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:26,700
someone who she openly dislikes and actually states earlier on in the stream is what is wrong with this world.

350
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,700
So, you know, clearly giving off some great vibes towards this guy

351
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,700
and encouraging her fans to send him lots of positive comments, right?

352
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,700
If people who don't like him want to take the piss out of him, they can go for it.

353
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,700
I mean, hell, that's what people like Leafy did for a career,

354
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,100
and they went after much more vulnerable targets.

355
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:46,500
The point that Fainted was making was that it was rather distasteful to go out of your way to make fun of someone

356
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:53,300
and expose them to that heat, especially when you have that power to really cause some potential harassment against them.

357
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:57,500
Once again, something that you've already admitted with a fairly heated gamer moment,

358
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,700
you're then arguing on the technicality, the one that really wasn't being argued in the first place.

359
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,100
Honestly, if Poki had just turned around and said,

360
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,100
Yep, he got what he deserved, she may have come out looking better.

361
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:12,100
And the only reason she can't really say that is because of the argument she had with Keemstar,

362
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,900
where she took that moral position against bullying.

363
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,900
And yes, you can see the parallels between the situations,

364
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,700
and if she really wanted to work out how to make a proper response in that instance,

365
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:27,700
she would have had to work out how to correctly express the distinction between that situation and this one.

366
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,100
And that is the only way you can respond to something like hypocrisy.

367
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,500
I think Poki genuinely wanted to try and have an open discussion,

368
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,100
but the main point that she continuously made was that,

369
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,700
I shouldn't have done that, but it was in my rights to.

370
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:44,500
Which is not a good argument. You have to just say,

371
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,900
Honestly, I was pissed off, because it's okay to be pissed off.

372
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,700
We're all human, we get annoyed.

373
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,700
If someone was re-uploading my uploads, I'd be annoyed too.

374
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,300
Because, in many ways, that's what you seem to express, Poki.

375
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,700
I'm making somewhat irrelevant points that are meant to serve as a defense,

376
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:06,100
actually tend to serve as a distraction from what could have been a genuinely decent response video.

377
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,500
This whole situation is a classic example of why commentators,

378
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,300
even if their arguments aren't the most watertight at first,

379
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:25,500
seem to keep winning these confrontations with YouTubers from other genres.

380
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,900
I actually don't think many of Feint's arguments were on closer inspection that strong,

381
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,900
and if we wanted to pull up one example, we can pull up the clickbait one.

382
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,700
I'm not sure you guys are gonna like this.

383
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:42,500
Chat, what do I say to make him realize that it's an asshole thing to falsely clickbait someone else?

384
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:50,100
Okay, so basically, Pokimane just cannot stand on her two feet and say that she is against clickbait content on YouTube.

385
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,900
She essentially collabed with a YouTuber who goes by the name of ShotgunPlays,

386
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,900
but realistically, he should be called,

387
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,900
I sound like I'm eating a chicken legend every time I speak.

388
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,300
And the reason this is a problem is because, by playing with this dude,

389
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,300
she essentially was supporting his content,

390
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,500
and 90% of the stuff that he uploads is straight-up misleading clickbait,

391
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,700
so I don't really know what Poki's doing playing with this dude, honestly.

392
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,700
By supporting this guy's videos,

393
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:23,300
it just means that she can't go out of her way to suggest that someone else making clickbait content isn't cool,

394
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:29,100
because girl, I'm sorry, but you've supported probably the biggest Fortnite clickbait YouTuber.

395
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:35,300
Firstly, Pokimane, in her original situation, says it's an asshole thing to do to clickbait quote someone else.

396
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:43,300
Chat, what do I say to make him realize that it's an asshole thing to falsely clickbait someone else?

397
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,300
Clickbaiting Fortnite is not necessarily comparable,

398
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,500
and even if Pokimane didn't express that point in the best way,

399
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:54,300
we can see why she takes issue with someone using another person's ass in the thumbnail,

400
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,700
and not necessarily taking issue with people clickbaiting Fortnite.

401
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:03,500
Oh my god, you put somebody else's butt on a thingy of me.

402
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,500
Like, there is a clear difference there, a clear moral dissonance.

403
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:13,700
Now that's just one argument, and the point of this video is not to go through every single Point of Fainted's videos,

404
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:20,500
and I agree with some, I disagree with others, I'm going to leave the direct ones to my good friend BWC, check his video out.

405
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,500
There were points that could have been made on Pokimane's behalf, but they slipped through the cracks,

406
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,900
because she clearly lacked the expertise to deal with the drama,

407
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:33,100
mainly because once again, Pokimane honestly wasn't specific enough with the point she was making,

408
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,700
and often wavered on what she was trying to say.

409
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:41,300
On one hand, she must have cared enough to think about what points she was trying to respond to,

410
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,900
but didn't seem to care enough to specify or provide further evidence,

411
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,500
which is a standard that a lot of commentary audiences are ravenous for.

412
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:54,500
When I make my videos, I'm consistently returning to drafts of my videos and telling myself to use more clips.

413
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:59,900
Use more evidence, it's a demanding genre, you have to pay attention to the surrounding culture.

414
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:06,500
Audiences on concept tend to have a bit of a bad taste regarding Twitch streamers, due to previous incidents,

415
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,100
and then you have this commentator, Fainted, who is the underdog,

416
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,900
and therefore many neutral viewers will like someone punching up,

417
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,300
and so if you make any comments that seem misrepresentative,

418
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:22,100
people will take that idea that this is the larger YouTuber trying to shut down the smaller one,

419
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,700
because they're the ones with that perceived power.

420
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,300
One of the most common criticisms levied against larger YouTubers is hypocrisy,

421
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,900
and the reason people do it because it's easy.

422
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:37,900
Creators like Pokimane will make statements day in and day out and will forget them the day after.

423
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:44,300
Comments will be made on whimsical sentiments, so it's easy to find one or two situations that contradict themselves.

424
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:49,100
If you want to be a moral advocate in the community, you need nuance.

425
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,100
The problem with lack of nuance is that, as said, you end up creating standards

426
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:59,300
that you yourself will inevitably fail to live up to, especially if you use vague arguments to justify it.

427
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:04,900
If you fail to distinguish the morality of situations that may seem similar on the surface,

428
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:09,100
you will inevitably look like a hypocrite, and people will point that out.

429
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:14,500
I do not think Pokimane is a malicious person. Matter of fact, I quite like her,

430
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:20,900
but it's clear through this situation she has revealed herself to be extremely naive, even dangerously naive.

431
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:25,300
I mean, when she admits she doesn't understand the copyright system on YouTube.

432
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,500
...before I took it, before it was taken down.

433
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,300
No.

434
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:29,900
I was suggesting...

435
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,800
Contact him for what?

436
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,100
I was just thinking, like, maybe...

437
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,700
With the whole strike system, I don't know if you're aware on YouTube,

438
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,200
it's pretty bad for a channel for them to get a proper copyright strike.

439
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,100
You can only get three and then your channel's deleted, so I was just thinking...

440
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,800
I believe that's a strike and not a copy strike.

441
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,500
It can be a copy strike.

442
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,100
You are a huge, huge influencer.

443
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,700
You have to look into the consequences that your actions might have,

444
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,500
after saying that you don't know what someone's going through.

445
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,900
On top of this, as mentioned, Pokimane didn't actually strike,

446
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:07,000
but had Omnia deliver a claim which turned into a strike when Bowblax appealed it.

447
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,500
Once again, this information makes Pokimane seem much less malicious,

448
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,900
but if she'd had more investment in the situation,

449
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:18,300
she would have been able to find this out and then put this case forward for herself,

450
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,300
rather than necessarily having other people bring it forward.

451
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,900
So this is, once again, revealing of that naivety.

452
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,300
And consequences are a two-way street.

453
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,200
And with the Dafsev situation, he came into your stream,

454
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,100
spammed the chat with a load of bullshit scam links,

455
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,200
directly uploaded content that wasn't his, had all his links public.

456
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,500
He must have had some awareness that his actions have consequences, too.

457
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,000
He must have anticipated this as a 17-year-old.

458
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,400
And frankly, I find it extremely hard to sympathise with him.

459
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,200
It may not be the route that I would have taken in dealing with it,

460
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,400
but the framing of him as some kind of victim is one that is really made applicable

461
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:00,900
due to Pokimane's significant clout and the fact that she doesn't know what he's going through.

462
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,600
Words come back to haunt you.

463
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,700
And that's one of the problems that seem apparent.

464
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:10,100
We've walked down this spiralling road of drama and Pokimane is still stuck at square one.

465
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:14,500
And it seemed that with every livestream, every discussion, every time she made a point,

466
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,000
she just seemed to lose more and more credibility,

467
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
because she wants to accept some of the criticism, but at the same time, she still feels she has a case.

468
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,600
And I feel she does, in a way.

469
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,800
But unfortunately, she would be constantly undone by some of the legitimate hypocrisy

470
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,000
displayed due to lack of justification.

471
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,400
Pokimane wants to play both teams, but ends up playing neither,

472
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,200
because she wants to both submit to the points and yet counter them.

473
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,500
When she does try to justify herself, they can feel like they're unnecessary.

474
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:46,100
One of the very weird techniques that I observed Pokimane partake in throughout the drama

475
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:50,600
was this sort of response, where she appeared to agree with the point being made against her,

476
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,900
but at the same time, she words it in a way that makes it sound like she's rebutting it.

477
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,000
A great example of this is here.

478
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
He sent a copyright strike, right?

479
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,900
Yes, it was a strike, not a claim.

480
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,900
My suggestion was, like, I personally think it would have been a better idea

481
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,600
had she DM'd you on Twitter and said,

482
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,000
Yo, Bowblax, would you mind taking down this video?

483
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
So then it means she can get what she wants, obviously the video taken down,

484
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,100
and then you don't get a copyright strike to your channel.

485
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:20,100
Just like some form of contact before initiating that, you know what I mean?

486
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,800
I totally get your point.

487
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,100
I would like to say, I think, if I'm remembering correctly,

488
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,800
I mentioned this to Bowblax and DMs way later,

489
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:35,800
that I wasn't fully aware about the situation and how copy strikes affected someone's channel.

490
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:43,300
I was under the assumption that full-on strikes are what take down a channel once you get three,

491
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:48,600
and I thought that it was different to copy strike a video than to strike an entire channel.

492
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,100
What we see here is basically Poki saying she was ignorant,

493
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:56,900
but wording it in a way as if that is a defence against the point that Fainted made,

494
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,200
rather than just saying that as a multi-million subscriber channel,

495
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,200
she probably shouldn't have been that ignorant in the first place,

496
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,500
which is the point that a lot of people were making.

497
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,200
And I'm not sure she's entirely aware she's doing it,

498
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,700
a lot of processes in our reasoning are rather subconscious,

499
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:16,100
but this sort of technique will always rub people the wrong way because of how it appears.

500
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,700
But you see the point I'm making here.

501
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,500
On one hand, you have Fainted, who in spite of the possible flaws of argumentation,

502
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,800
has resented points in an articulate, systematic, and firm way,

503
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,500
and on the other, you have Pokimane, who, whether there are points there or not,

504
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:34,400
fall through because she can't seem to compartmentalise criticism into specifics,

505
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,200
and ends up just spray-firing her defences.

506
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,800
And honestly, the stream highlights that difference.

507
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:44,000
When you put these two people against each other, the contrast is so vast,

508
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,500
and this is the power of critical commentary.

509
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,300
When you've done this for a while, it just puts you in a different league.

510
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:55,000
A majority of the reason that Pokimane was called out, on top of the copyright strike,

511
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,900
was her hypocrisy, and to bring it back to my first point of the video,

512
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:03,500
I'm sure many of you guys won't be surprised to find out that it's fairly easy to point out

513
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,200
hypocrisy in many of the Twitch streamers.

514
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,000
Pretty much anyone who doesn't spend an hour a day evaluating their morality.

515
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,900
It doesn't mean they're bad people, it just means they're not always thinking about it,

516
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:17,000
and it's just a case of when they're put into that rotation.

517
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,400
Many people from other genres just don't think about it, and we commentators do.

518
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,500
And I don't think that's a bad thing, there's nothing wrong with pushing for consistency,

519
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,700
but it is a difference, and one that has to be accepted.

520
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:34,200
And I don't dislike Pokimane, because maybe people like Jake Paul and RiceGum have done terrible stuff,

521
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,800
and they barely address it at all, and Pokimane tried to come forward and try to hit it,

522
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,100
and she was just out of her depth in trying to retrospectively explain a morality

523
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,900
that she knows she probably didn't think too much about at the time.

524
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:51,700
But at the same time, in her head, she feels that she's a good person, and I understand that.

525
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,700
But unfortunately, that's just the way the cookie crumbles.

526
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:58,800
You see, you can't justify what you already deem unjustifiable,

527
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,200
and you can't defend what you've already deemed to be indefensible,

528
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,300
and you can't rationalize what you've deemed to be irrational.

529
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,300
So to finish, responding to commentators is risky business.

530
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,900
The reason I don't do these videos on people like RiceGum

531
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,900
is because they don't care about their reputation when they respond.

532
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,700
Pokimane clearly does. So I'll leave these points.

533
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:22,000
Make sure your responses are tight, make sure people know exactly what points you're addressing,

534
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
make sure you use evidence very clearly, make sure you work out the concessions that they make,

535
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,200
and points that you might agree on, such as the point that Dav Sev is an annoying twat,

536
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,400
and then work out how you can use those agreements or premises to bring that person around

537
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,200
to your in-the-moment perspective, even if complete agreement is not quite possible.

538
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,400
That is the summary of wisdom that I can leave you with today,

539
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,200
and I hope you can take something away from it if you are indeed watching.

540
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,000
So yeah, that was the video, once again.

541
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,200
Very, very impressive. Thank you, guys, for the support of recent.

542
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,000
I would love to hear your comments on the situation below,

543
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,800
because it was quite an interesting one, definitely one of the more split situations,

544
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:08,400
where a lot of it just came down to how you speak, and I love those situations,

545
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,800
because it's really interesting how people's perspectives are actually much more shaped sometimes

546
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,800
by how someone presents their point, rather than what points they have.

547
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,000
And so, I love investigating these.

548
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,200
I wanna give a big shout-out to my editors who've done another fabulous job.

549
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,800

564
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,600
and I hope this made it a bit better.

Take care, guys. Love you lot.

566
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,600
