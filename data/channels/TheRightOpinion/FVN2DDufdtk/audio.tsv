0	10200	Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
10200	15300	And I thought we'd cover some drama that's a bit more recent, because, oh my, do we adore the drama.
15300	21200	Now, I've covered Twitch streamers before, and I'll cover Twitch streamers again, because they are an interesting set of people,
21200	25700	and in spite of the fact that many of them are collectivized into a category by commentators,
25700	28400	they are all at least somewhat distinguished in what they do.
28400	35600	In a video last year, I covered Zoe Burger, someone whose rise to meteoric stardom was paired with an equally catastrophic fall.
35600	41500	She was an absolute magnet of drama, and one of the more sexually suggestive characters out of that legion.
41500	43900	But at the same time, she was her own individual.
43900	49700	She was banned off Twitch, and mainly gained infamy for antics on YouTube and the subsequent drama that yielded.
49700	54700	On the other hand, we have female streamers who may well be considered attractive by their audience.
54700	60800	I mean, who doesn't want to look their best on camera, but at the same time doesn't necessarily seek to exploit that.
60800	63200	And this is where we reach Pokimane.
63200	70400	Pokimane is someone who is established on both YouTube and Twitch, with over 2.5 million subscribers slash followers on each platform.
70400	73000	That's something which obviously cannot be ignored.
73000	81000	She does some gaming, she does some reaction-based videos, but overall, as people go, she's not an individual who has received exceptional controversy.
81000	85100	This is fairly typical for most genres with a fairly undemanding audience,
85100	89600	much less demanding than the ones who watch critical commentators like myself.
89600	95000	Most commentators also tend to have a list of people who are controversial and easy to make videos on.
95000	100900	This is a rotating list of people, including RiceGums, The Pools, Morgz, KSI, Deji,
100900	105200	so maybe some of the beauty community now, maybe throw in Emma Chamberlain too.
105200	109400	Maybe you like making thought pieces on who the next content cop is gonna be on,
109400	112000	or even if there will be a new content cop at all.
112000	116500	What this means is that although people will be doing shady or at least debatable actions,
116500	120400	if people aren't focusing on them, then it'll probably pass under the radar,
120400	127200	and a lot of creators, including the person we're going to discuss today, have been sheltered from that sort of environment until now.
127200	133000	However, as spoken in the past, the alienation of drama can often mean that when it eventually does confront one of these people,
133000	137400	it means they are way out of their depth with no idea of how to actually handle it.
137400	143400	Generally, this has meant that in the history of Twitch streamers versus commentators, the Twitch streamers tend to lose.
143400	148000	Looking back to Pyrocynical versus Zoe Burger, PewDiePie versus Alinity,
148000	151200	and yes, in both of those situations, for example,
151200	158100	it's fairly reasonable to argue that you could side with Pyrocynical and PewDiePie in those situations regardless of outcome.
158100	165000	But as much as the circumstance does comprise the drama, the handling and the presentation are equally important.
165000	168500	Another real problem is how a lot of this drama can often be perceived.
168500	172100	Expose videos have been monopolized recently by the commentary genre,
172100	177200	and so attempting to make any sort of response to them is the equivalent of going to play an away match.
177200	183400	You're entering someone else's stadium and you'll be attracting their audience, even if you're responding on your own channel.
183400	188300	One of the problems with a lot of drama is that it always feels like an us versus them situation.
188300	191800	You really are expected to side with one of the people involved,
191800	195700	but sometimes there is a clear moral high ground when it comes to these claims.
195700	200300	But often, when there isn't, we have to look a bit more closer than many people choose to.
200300	205700	The thing about drama is that whatever it yields, it can be assumed as some sort of moral standard,
205700	210800	even though we often forget about the conclusions we make and just contradict ourselves in the future.
210800	214500	I'm a man who does enjoy some consistency,
214500	215200	some,
215200	219000	because whatever disputes occur do have reputational legacies,
219000	225700	and it's important that we're holding people to account, but not unfairly singling them out because of some subconscious bias.
225700	227700	So let's talk about today's situation.
227700	234300	On the 28th of December, a very small YouTuber by the name of Fainted released a video called The Dark Side of Pokimane,
234300	239900	in which he alleged that while the public's back was turned, Pokimane had done some pretty shady stuff.
239900	245400	I'll be breaking down the details in a moment, but like some of the most infamous streamers in the past,
245400	250700	some of the main claims were on the notion of copyright striking, or as many people now like to call it, copy striking.
250700	256200	Firstly, in the incident of a series of uploaded Twitter clips on a feud between her and Keemstar,
256200	260900	and secondly, on a channel that re-uploaded stream clips of her known as Davsep.
260900	267400	These are both fairly separate situations, but fell under the umbrella of criticism that Pokimane was facing down.
267400	270700	When he uploaded a video, Fainted had a few hundred subscribers,
270700	274700	but the video blew up and he's in a quite different position, it's safe to say.
274700	276800	Everyone loves a good old success story.
276800	280700	On top of this, Fainted's video contained multiple allegations of hypocrisy,
280700	286700	particularly implied through the situation in which Pokimane criticized Keemstar for allegedly bullying a fan,
286700	293500	promoting a principle that many claimed was contradicted by her behaviour towards the subjects of Fainted's video.
293500	300100	Then a couple weeks later, on the 11th of January, PewDiePie uploaded a video with the classic title Stop Doing This,
300100	304300	in which he requested a host of YouTubers to, well, stop doing this.
304300	309500	This being the unwarranted copyright striking of other videos that seemingly didn't deserve them.
309500	315000	In this list was the lady herself, Pokimane, and the fact that she had allegedly struck down the Twitter feud,
315000	320900	which, as pointed out by PewDiePie, had been picked up by the algorithms and were being publicized,
320900	324300	and Pokimane probably wanted to keep it out of the public eye.
324300	330200	However, this caused a classic Streisand effect and now has the platform's largest YouTuber covering it.
330200	333700	Well, we'll see how he's doing against T-Series by the time this video comes out.
333700	338900	So, clearly, with a lot of allegations staring herself down, Pokimane decided to make her response video,
338900	341300	in which she addressed some of the claims made against her.
341300	345900	She admits some of her transgressions, but also decides to hold her ground on some points,
345900	349600	particularly the situation regarding Davsev, which is an interesting one.
349600	354500	She also responds directly to both PewDiePie and Fainted, including clips of their videos,
354500	359600	which, of course, provokes an additional response from Fainted, which was mainly rebutting Pokimane's response,
359600	366300	and some of the points that she made, kind of concluding that Pokimane's response was insufficient in the scope of actually responding,
366300	369800	and more just a way to dodge and reframe a lot of what's going on.
369800	375500	But is that the case? Because, honestly, watching through Fainted's initial video, I wasn't really won over.
375500	379400	I thought it was a bit weak, but I can see why other people were won over.
379400	387000	Equally, I don't think that any of the conclusions, necessarily, that I've observed make Pokimane a bad person, per se,
387000	393400	but I still think she's made a huge mistake, and when your ratings are going badly, there's always a reason.
393400	397100	So today, I don't want this to be an exposed video, it's not,
397100	401400	but more a guide on why people might turn against you in the face of drama,
401400	406400	and how someone who has probably never dealt with it before can take it on in the future,
406400	409600	because, you know, that's what we do here on The Right Opinion.
417000	426600	One of the most contentious issues on the platform is that of fair use.
426600	430000	We have some sort of vague manga about the dos and the don'ts,
430000	435200	but when a situation that blurs the lines comes about, it often throws the community into chaos,
435200	437900	with no clear argument on what is actually right.
437900	442700	On top of this, it is a really passionate topic, people care a hell of a lot,
442700	447200	and if you're doing it unjustly, you are gonna have an uphill battle defending yourself.
447200	449900	This is the first situation that comes about with Pokimane,
449900	453300	because what happened, as both testified by her and fainted,
453300	458000	is basically Keemstar was on Twitter, had an argument with some fans of another creator,
458000	460100	the colourful character SSSniperWolf,
460100	465000	before Pokimane stepped into the fray to go toe-to-toe with Keem in a Twitter video battle.
465000	468100	But then a load of people contributed as well, and a load of memes,
468100	472400	and a load of people who I'm not familiar with, because I don't use this damn site enough.
472400	474800	Right... there.
474800	478400	This nigga's organisation is actually kind of on fleek.
478400	482600	The shadow's even, you can tell he's stacked up, even the angle fucking sucks.
482600	485100	And then right here.
487100	489000	This nigga's wires is in place.
489000	494200	Now, after a discussion, it was assumed to be over, and many people continued with their lives.
494200	498900	However, a compilation of this discussion was downloaded and re-uploaded onto YouTube,
498900	500800	and it clearly caught people's attention.
500800	505400	And because it caught people's attention, YouTube decided that it was going to blow the video up.
505400	509700	So suddenly this drama that Pokimane probably regretted involving herself in the first place,
509700	515300	was blowing up all over YouTube, and there was nothing she could do about it, or so people thought.
515300	519900	Because Pokimane decided to have her company, Omnia Media, remove the video,
519900	523100	and deal a claim onto the YouTuber known as Bowblax.
523100	526500	Now, most people believe he received a strike straight away,
526500	532700	but actually this was a miscommunication, and something that has been clarified recently through additional research.
532700	537600	However, even with that said, it did eventually turn into a strike due to the appeals,
537600	542600	and for anyone who doesn't know, a copyright strike has a significant effect on the mobility of a channel,
542600	543800	even if it's only one.
543800	547300	It causes a fair bit of stress, and takes a few months to expire.
547300	551300	So on one hand, you have Fainted and PewDiePie, who call out Pokimane for doing this,
551300	554500	of course it's annoying when something like this blows out of proportion,
554500	556800	but such a response is rather uncalled for.
556800	560200	So in a way, I can understand why you want to take down this video,
560200	567700	because this selected thing blows up and becomes even bigger, thanks to YouTube's system being kind of stupid.
567700	572600	At least I can somewhat understand the motivation of trying to take down that video.
572600	578400	But the problem here, and the same problem that goes with every single example that I brought up in this video,
578400	581000	is that you're just drawing more attention to it.
581000	583100	It's a Streisand effect every single time.
583100	587900	Pokimane responds to them saying that although she felt perfectly within legal right to remove the video,
587900	591700	she understands that it was a morally problematic decision to take.
591700	596900	Although I was legally within my right to take down the video, morally, and as a content creator,
596900	599900	it wasn't something that I should have done, because, I mean, at the end of the day,
599900	604100	those were tweets that me and Keem made publicly, and videos that we made publicly.
604100	609000	Fainted then disputes this using his commentary credentials by citing a Keemstar tweet.
609000	613200	And you know what, I'm not even gonna bother giving my opinions on this, we'll just leave that to the man himself, Keemstar.
613200	616000	Pokimane, I think you're confused on what transformative means.
616000	620800	The video where they played both our Twitter vids was transformative because it's a collage of multiple clips.
620800	625800	There's case law on this. It's not a direct upload, like you stated, you could get sued for false flagging.
625800	631200	This gave me the impression that he seemed to think that the video was fair use because it was in a compilation format.
631200	635300	And so I want to put this on hold for a moment, because I notice a problem in the reasoning.
635300	641500	Firstly, I think, contrary to my friend's belief here, that actually Pokimane was completely in her quote,
641500	647300	legal rights to remove the video, even though there is some sort of claim that this has been put to test in the courts.
647300	652100	I cannot find it, and I highly doubt a compilation of clips would be considered fair use,
652100	657500	considering some of the other cases, even if they're done in a way that shows a chronologically arranged discussion,
657500	660100	which could be considered part of the transformation.
660100	663900	Dealing with fair use is incredibly complicated, we know where the extremes lie,
663900	667200	we know that Chris Stutman's film reviews are almost certainly fair use,
667200	671100	and we know that re-uploads of Coldplay songs are most likely not fair use.
671100	675800	But a lot of the content falls in between, and therefore the only way to resolve this is through the courts.
675800	680800	Either way, fair use or not, I find this whole debacle to be a bit of a non-argument,
680800	684600	and if Pokimane was taken to court over this, I think she'd win.
684600	689800	But here's the thing, just because something is legally accepted doesn't mean we should accept it.
689800	693000	Laws are typically based off some sort of moral foundations,
693000	698800	and therefore when Pokimane accepted the regards of legality her move was morally dubious,
698800	701800	it should have technically invalidated her argument,
701800	705400	because generally we perceive ourselves on the basis of morality,
705400	709200	and therefore if she actively did something that she's aware was immoral,
709200	714200	then legality only exists as a technical defense to avoid being sued.
714200	717400	Just because something's legal does not make it moral,
717400	720400	and therefore means we shouldn't necessarily accept it.
720400	723600	Laws themselves exist for that reason.
723600	726800	For the betterment of society, what do we build the laws on?
726800	728800	We build those laws on principles.
728800	734600	Laws are partly built on morals, and we're always debating what should and should not be changed.
734600	740800	If you can't morally justify your actions, then the fact that it's legal does not serve as a defense,
740800	743600	other than, of course, in court.
743600	747800	But audiences are not jurors, they're just people who have opinions.
747800	751800	The thing is, that although I'm generally against re-uploaded content,
751800	758200	I feel that these circumstances make the situation much more of an archiving of a conversation that occurred.
758200	763800	Trying to mute what unfortunately happened and could have been archived any other way is where the issue lies,
763800	769800	and I don't think that was a reasonable action on her part, and I think me and her can agree there now.
769800	774000	And this is one other thing, she uses this term in a way that I would call a passive defense.
774000	778200	Basically, she doesn't run the point as if it's counter to her position on the situation,
778200	779800	or the point she's trying to make.
779800	784600	She still concedes, apologizes, and admits she was wrong, and fair play for that.
784600	789800	Although I was legally within my right to take down the video, morally, and as a content creator,
789800	792800	it wasn't something that I should have done, because, I mean, at the end of the day,
792800	797200	those were tweets that me and Keem made publicly, and videos that we made publicly,
797200	804200	so I totally apologize for that, and I spoke to the guy who made those videos, like, a few weeks back,
804200	806400	and we had resolved all of this in DMs.
806400	810800	However, because she made the point, Fainted can extract it and run against it,
810800	814400	and as a passive defense, her video really could have done without it.
814400	819900	A passive defense is only really utilized as a rhetorical device to demonstrate reasonability,
819900	822300	and I think that's what Poki was trying to do here.
822300	827300	The problem is that when you're defending yourself, a passive defense has to explain your mindset,
827300	830600	rather than necessarily justifying your ability to commit the action.
830600	831900	For example, I say,
831900	833600	I'm sorry for shouting at that lady.
833600	836900	I was drunk and depressed, but it was completely wrong on me.
836900	837700	Rather than,
837700	839600	I'm sorry for shouting at that lady.
839600	843800	I was, well, within my rights to do it, but it was completely wrong nonetheless.
843800	848600	Because it's a moral issue, the way I've worded the second explanation sounds like a scapegoat,
848600	853800	because it sounds like I've shifted part responsibility onto the legal system for allowing me to do it,
853800	857300	and that's where you have to be very careful on how it comes across.
857300	859900	I find Pokimane's response genuinely interesting,
859900	864000	because I think it's one of the first ones that clearly have the correct base formula down.
864000	867600	When responding to something that you know is wrong, it's important to admit your mistakes,
867600	871900	but at the same time, try to make sure the audience can empathize with the mindset you're in,
871900	875400	and she does appear to attempt that and lay that structure down,
875400	877300	but she just pulls the wrong points in.
877300	881800	There is a right way and a wrong way to justify yourself, and this tends to lean the wrong way.
881800	884800	This is a problem particularly evident throughout Pokimane's response.
884800	889300	The emphasis of her points do not reflect the points that are of interest to the audience.
889300	892400	Everything that might be relevant seems rather brushed over.
892400	896200	I don't think it's her intent, but it can come across as rather dismissive.
896200	901500	Equally, I don't think it's her intent to necessarily misframe the claims being made against her,
902600	903500	but...
904000	909500	Some people were saying that I pulled up his, like, personal Instagram and made fun of him or something.
909500	912800	So what she does is honestly pretty evil.
912800	917400	Poki finds Dabsev's personal Instagram page, and then just laughing at pictures of him.
917400	922400	He had his Instagram linked in the description of the videos that he was posting,
922400	925100	so it was not like a personal or private Instagram.
925100	926700	I didn't attack the way that he looked,
926700	929900	and obviously he was watching my stream while he was on the call with me,
929900	931900	and he saw that I was looking at his Instagram.
931900	934300	He said, do you like what you see?
934300	936800	Showing off all this stuff.
936800	942000	Yeah, I don't like people trying to make it seem like I would go to someone's Instagram with alien intent
942000	943700	just to, like, bash on them.
943700	946200	Hey, hold on a minute. What kind of cutting was that, bro?
946200	948200	She just completely cut up my point.
948200	952700	Poki finds Dabsev's personal Instagram page, and then just laughing at pictures of him.
952700	954100	Let me show you what it actually looked like,
954100	957400	and then you can probably guess why Pokimane didn't include that in her video.
957400	960200	Poki finds Dabsev's personal Instagram page,
960200	965300	and literally starts looking through it and laughing at it in front of thousands of viewers.
965300	968800	Problem here is that she's gone into it like a lot of public figures.
968800	973100	They come from a genre where optics and wording don't seem like a big deal,
973100	975100	and suddenly making vague statements,
975100	978300	it's fairly easy for a commentator like Fainted,
978300	981200	who I don't even rate as an argumentation expert.
981200	982800	You have to be specific.
982800	984600	You have to be clear with what you mean,
984600	989600	and you cannot misframe the situation to be disproportionately sympathetic to your case,
989600	992300	or disproportionately harsh against another person,
992300	996200	because there is nobody who will pick that up like the commentators.
996200	999000	I think this is a really important learning experience
999000	1002400	that we should definitely take forward going into the second situation.
1002400	1004400	...
1004400	1006400	...
1006400	1008400	...
1008400	1010400	...
1010400	1012400	...
1012400	1014400	...
1014400	1016400	...
1016400	1020800	Thing about the Dabsev situation is that if Pokimane had approached it correctly,
1020800	1022400	then she could have been in the clear.
1022400	1027000	This is the real pivotal situation that galvanised a lot of the drama,
1027000	1029700	and to completely apprehend how to respond,
1029700	1035100	she kinda had to understand exactly what people's objections were to the original scenario,
1035100	1039100	and once again, Fainted, on one hand, had a much harder sell.
1039100	1041500	Dabsev was clearly an annoying twat,
1041500	1046700	and frankly, people are not inclined to side with someone they may perceive as an annoying twat.
1046700	1048700	...
1048700	1050700	...
1050700	1052700	...
1052700	1054700	...
1054700	1056700	...
1056700	1058700	...
1058700	1060700	...
1060700	1062700	...
1062700	1064700	...
1064700	1066700	...
1066700	1068700	...
1068700	1070700	...
1070700	1074700	The thing Fainted very smartly did was not side with Dabsev.
1074700	1081700	Not necessarily defending Dabsev, he knew that if Pokimane decided to try and couple him to Dabsev in any sort of way,
1081700	1085100	then he could object and point out the flaw in her argument,
1085100	1089100	because Pokimane didn't pay close enough attention to respond meticulously.
1089100	1092500	She makes some very vague claims and thus suffers because of them,
1092500	1095900	even though with better wording, she could have really put it to bed.
1095900	1100100	At this point in the discussion, I think everybody can agree that Pokimane is in the right here,
1100100	1103500	because of course, if this guy's proud of the fact that he's uploading clickbait videos,
1103500	1105300	it kind of tells us a lot about his character.
1105300	1111300	So if the video he's uploaded consists of literally just a stream clip nabbed from her livestream,
1111300	1115700	then in that case, I think she went 100% as the right to take down the video.
1115700	1120300	But because, once again, she focuses on one issue which she doesn't really respond to properly,
1120300	1124100	she first cuts Fainted's clip-up in a way that changes the message.
1124100	1127900	Now, whether she wanted to do that for efficiency or not is besides the point.
1127900	1130300	It came across as twisting information.
1130300	1136300	Equally, it's really important to not be distracted by the general representation of the points.
1136300	1140900	Fainted may be a smaller YouTuber, but right now, he is the one with the momentum,
1140900	1146300	and therefore, if you want to respond to him, you have to make sure his arguments are being communicated properly,
1146300	1148700	and that equally, you make sure there's no confusion.
1148700	1150300	For example, this earlier clip.
1150300	1156900	And people have been using clips from that livestream to try to make it look like I randomly take down videos whenever I want,
1156900	1160900	or I do that commonly when it's definitely not the case.
1160900	1162900	Right, so now Daddy Fainted's getting called out.
1162900	1166900	I'm pretty sure in my video, I never mentioned anything about her frequently taking down videos.
1166900	1168900	My video is focused on your hypocrisy.
1168900	1174700	Now, as noted, Fainted lays claim that this clip is about him, but Poki never actively says it is,
1174700	1179100	and there's fair evidence to assume that, from other YouTubers, this narrative isn't rare.
1179100	1183500	So it's very possible that Poki caught other videos or comments from people,
1183500	1188300	but because she put it in her title that she's responding to the dark side of Pokimane,
1188300	1193900	it implies that this is a narrative that is local to his video, even though it's not.
1193900	1201700	It is actually a general narrative that is somewhat existent in other YouTubers who have made videos and got decent views.
1201700	1204500	Pokimane recently seems to be going around doing a lot of scummy things, pretty much.
1204500	1209300	She's striking out a bunch of smaller creators, she's making people cry in front of 20,000 people right on stream,
1209300	1211300	and she's honestly just, you know, a thought.
1211300	1217100	I want to put it out there that I never knowingly take down a video that is transformative content.
1217100	1223100	I would not take down videos that people have spent time, like, creating commentary for,
1223100	1226100	and editing and producing together, I don't think that's fair at all.
1226100	1228700	And obviously that's why there's tons of videos out there,
1228700	1230700	Twitch compilations where I'm still in them,
1230700	1232700	or critiques of me or drama,
1232700	1236700	or videos that I'm in that are positive or negative that I don't take down.
1236700	1239500	Now, I say this because she uses the phrase people.
1239500	1243500	Fainted is not people, Fainted is a person, as far as I know.
1243500	1249500	And I think we can deduce here that once again she's trying to address a different narrative being pushed by certain YouTubers.
1249500	1254500	The problem is when you put someone's video title in your title, it sounds like you're addressing them.
1254500	1259100	Fainted had no real right to lay claim to that comment other than that fact.
1259100	1264900	It would have been narcissistic to assume that his video was the only one that promoted a narrative like that.
1264900	1270700	Equally by addressing some narratives and overlooking others, it just seems like she's dancing around certain points,
1270700	1273900	and honestly she didn't really need to address Fainted at all,
1273900	1278300	especially when she only brings up the situation about how it's being framed.
1278300	1284100	And one of the biggest problems is when you bring up the question of optics and not just the direct situation,
1284100	1285700	it becomes very, very sketchy.
1285700	1290900	The only thing that she actively goes out of her way to address Fainted on is the Instagram situation,
1290900	1294700	and once again, if you can explain why you did this barely enough, easy picking.
1294700	1298500	You're pissed off that someone has taken your content, being an irritating bastard,
1298500	1301900	and so to elicit your perception of justice against this davsev twat,
1301900	1304500	you think that he deserves to get the piss taken out of him,
1304500	1309300	and so you go airing all your dirty laundry on the stream, and you admit that you went a bit too far,
1309300	1311700	and you know what? That's pretty much what she said,
1311700	1316300	and probably why Fainted doesn't bother addressing that part, because the majority of it is fairly agreeable.
1316300	1321100	The point of this is just to say that was an entirely different scenario and situation,
1321100	1324300	where I was well within my right to take down his content,
1324500	1327900	but also in that moment and on that live stream.
1327900	1330300	Like, I shouldn't have had that conversation on stream,
1330300	1333700	and it definitely was a moment of frustration.
1333700	1337100	That shouldn't have been, like, publicized in that way, for sure.
1337100	1339100	But then she ends up at this point.
1339100	1344100	He had his Instagram linked in the description of the videos that he was posting,
1344100	1346900	so it was not like a personal or private Instagram.
1346900	1348500	I didn't attack the way that he looked,
1348500	1351700	and obviously he was watching my stream while he was on the call with me,
1351700	1353700	and he saw that I was looking at his Instagram.
1353700	1355900	He said, do you like what you see?
1355900	1359900	And once again, we end up in a situation of how someone was allowed to do something,
1359900	1362900	the notion that she found his personal Instagram page,
1362900	1364700	because it was linked in the description.
1364700	1367500	And honestly, once again, her point is not wrong.
1367500	1368900	She can do what she wants.
1368900	1374300	The fact that Davsev is a YouTuber, an adult, putting content on a public platform,
1374300	1378300	and therefore any links he posts as public may be picked up by anyone.
1378300	1384100	But it sounds like Pokimane interpreted the point against her as if she was doxing someone,
1384100	1388100	rather than actually necessarily the point that Fainted was trying to make.
1388100	1391100	Okay, so this is the one part of the video that does kind of trigger me a little bit.
1391100	1396100	So in Pokimane's logic, just because Davsev had his Instagram linked on one of his Twitch compilations,
1396100	1400500	that gives her the right to display his Instagram in front of thousands of people on her Twitch stream,
1400500	1406700	someone who she openly dislikes and actually states earlier on in the stream is what is wrong with this world.
1406700	1409700	So, you know, clearly giving off some great vibes towards this guy
1409700	1412700	and encouraging her fans to send him lots of positive comments, right?
1412700	1415700	If people who don't like him want to take the piss out of him, they can go for it.
1415700	1418700	I mean, hell, that's what people like Leafy did for a career,
1418700	1421100	and they went after much more vulnerable targets.
1421100	1426500	The point that Fainted was making was that it was rather distasteful to go out of your way to make fun of someone
1426500	1433300	and expose them to that heat, especially when you have that power to really cause some potential harassment against them.
1433300	1437500	Once again, something that you've already admitted with a fairly heated gamer moment,
1437500	1442700	you're then arguing on the technicality, the one that really wasn't being argued in the first place.
1442700	1445100	Honestly, if Poki had just turned around and said,
1445100	1448100	Yep, he got what he deserved, she may have come out looking better.
1448100	1452100	And the only reason she can't really say that is because of the argument she had with Keemstar,
1452100	1454900	where she took that moral position against bullying.
1454900	1457900	And yes, you can see the parallels between the situations,
1457900	1461700	and if she really wanted to work out how to make a proper response in that instance,
1461700	1467700	she would have had to work out how to correctly express the distinction between that situation and this one.
1467700	1471100	And that is the only way you can respond to something like hypocrisy.
1471100	1474500	I think Poki genuinely wanted to try and have an open discussion,
1474500	1477100	but the main point that she continuously made was that,
1477100	1480700	I shouldn't have done that, but it was in my rights to.
1480700	1484500	Which is not a good argument. You have to just say,
1484500	1487900	Honestly, I was pissed off, because it's okay to be pissed off.
1487900	1489700	We're all human, we get annoyed.
1489700	1493700	If someone was re-uploading my uploads, I'd be annoyed too.
1493700	1497300	Because, in many ways, that's what you seem to express, Poki.
1497300	1500700	I'm making somewhat irrelevant points that are meant to serve as a defense,
1500700	1506100	actually tend to serve as a distraction from what could have been a genuinely decent response video.
1515100	1518500	This whole situation is a classic example of why commentators,
1518500	1521300	even if their arguments aren't the most watertight at first,
1521300	1525500	seem to keep winning these confrontations with YouTubers from other genres.
1525500	1529900	I actually don't think many of Feint's arguments were on closer inspection that strong,
1529900	1532900	and if we wanted to pull up one example, we can pull up the clickbait one.
1532900	1534700	I'm not sure you guys are gonna like this.
1534700	1542500	Chat, what do I say to make him realize that it's an asshole thing to falsely clickbait someone else?
1542500	1550100	Okay, so basically, Pokimane just cannot stand on her two feet and say that she is against clickbait content on YouTube.
1550100	1553900	She essentially collabed with a YouTuber who goes by the name of ShotgunPlays,
1553900	1555900	but realistically, he should be called,
1555900	1558900	I sound like I'm eating a chicken legend every time I speak.
1563500	1566300	And the reason this is a problem is because, by playing with this dude,
1566300	1568300	she essentially was supporting his content,
1568300	1572500	and 90% of the stuff that he uploads is straight-up misleading clickbait,
1572500	1575700	so I don't really know what Poki's doing playing with this dude, honestly.
1577500	1578700	By supporting this guy's videos,
1578700	1583300	it just means that she can't go out of her way to suggest that someone else making clickbait content isn't cool,
1583300	1589100	because girl, I'm sorry, but you've supported probably the biggest Fortnite clickbait YouTuber.
1589100	1595300	Firstly, Pokimane, in her original situation, says it's an asshole thing to do to clickbait quote someone else.
1595300	1603300	Chat, what do I say to make him realize that it's an asshole thing to falsely clickbait someone else?
1603300	1606300	Clickbaiting Fortnite is not necessarily comparable,
1606300	1609500	and even if Pokimane didn't express that point in the best way,
1609500	1614300	we can see why she takes issue with someone using another person's ass in the thumbnail,
1614300	1617700	and not necessarily taking issue with people clickbaiting Fortnite.
1617700	1623500	Oh my god, you put somebody else's butt on a thingy of me.
1623700	1627500	Like, there is a clear difference there, a clear moral dissonance.
1627500	1633700	Now that's just one argument, and the point of this video is not to go through every single Point of Fainted's videos,
1633700	1640500	and I agree with some, I disagree with others, I'm going to leave the direct ones to my good friend BWC, check his video out.
1640500	1644500	There were points that could have been made on Pokimane's behalf, but they slipped through the cracks,
1644500	1647900	because she clearly lacked the expertise to deal with the drama,
1647900	1653100	mainly because once again, Pokimane honestly wasn't specific enough with the point she was making,
1653100	1655700	and often wavered on what she was trying to say.
1655700	1661300	On one hand, she must have cared enough to think about what points she was trying to respond to,
1661300	1664900	but didn't seem to care enough to specify or provide further evidence,
1664900	1668500	which is a standard that a lot of commentary audiences are ravenous for.
1668500	1674500	When I make my videos, I'm consistently returning to drafts of my videos and telling myself to use more clips.
1674500	1679900	Use more evidence, it's a demanding genre, you have to pay attention to the surrounding culture.
1679900	1686500	Audiences on concept tend to have a bit of a bad taste regarding Twitch streamers, due to previous incidents,
1686500	1690100	and then you have this commentator, Fainted, who is the underdog,
1690100	1693900	and therefore many neutral viewers will like someone punching up,
1693900	1697300	and so if you make any comments that seem misrepresentative,
1697300	1702100	people will take that idea that this is the larger YouTuber trying to shut down the smaller one,
1702100	1705700	because they're the ones with that perceived power.
1705700	1710300	One of the most common criticisms levied against larger YouTubers is hypocrisy,
1710300	1712900	and the reason people do it because it's easy.
1712900	1717900	Creators like Pokimane will make statements day in and day out and will forget them the day after.
1717900	1724300	Comments will be made on whimsical sentiments, so it's easy to find one or two situations that contradict themselves.
1724300	1729100	If you want to be a moral advocate in the community, you need nuance.
1729100	1733100	The problem with lack of nuance is that, as said, you end up creating standards
1733100	1739300	that you yourself will inevitably fail to live up to, especially if you use vague arguments to justify it.
1739300	1744900	If you fail to distinguish the morality of situations that may seem similar on the surface,
1744900	1749100	you will inevitably look like a hypocrite, and people will point that out.
1749100	1754500	I do not think Pokimane is a malicious person. Matter of fact, I quite like her,
1754500	1760900	but it's clear through this situation she has revealed herself to be extremely naive, even dangerously naive.
1760900	1765300	I mean, when she admits she doesn't understand the copyright system on YouTube.
1765300	1768500	...before I took it, before it was taken down.
1768500	1769300	No.
1769300	1769900	I was suggesting...
1769900	1771800	Contact him for what?
1771800	1775100	I was just thinking, like, maybe...
1775100	1777700	With the whole strike system, I don't know if you're aware on YouTube,
1777700	1781200	it's pretty bad for a channel for them to get a proper copyright strike.
1781200	1784100	You can only get three and then your channel's deleted, so I was just thinking...
1784100	1787800	I believe that's a strike and not a copy strike.
1787800	1789500	It can be a copy strike.
1789500	1792100	You are a huge, huge influencer.
1792100	1795700	You have to look into the consequences that your actions might have,
1795700	1798500	after saying that you don't know what someone's going through.
1798500	1801900	On top of this, as mentioned, Pokimane didn't actually strike,
1801900	1807000	but had Omnia deliver a claim which turned into a strike when Bowblax appealed it.
1807000	1811500	Once again, this information makes Pokimane seem much less malicious,
1811500	1813900	but if she'd had more investment in the situation,
1813900	1818300	she would have been able to find this out and then put this case forward for herself,
1818300	1821300	rather than necessarily having other people bring it forward.
1821300	1824900	So this is, once again, revealing of that naivety.
1824900	1827300	And consequences are a two-way street.
1827300	1830200	And with the Dafsev situation, he came into your stream,
1830200	1833100	spammed the chat with a load of bullshit scam links,
1833100	1837200	directly uploaded content that wasn't his, had all his links public.
1837200	1841500	He must have had some awareness that his actions have consequences, too.
1841500	1845000	He must have anticipated this as a 17-year-old.
1845000	1848400	And frankly, I find it extremely hard to sympathise with him.
1848400	1851200	It may not be the route that I would have taken in dealing with it,
1851200	1855400	but the framing of him as some kind of victim is one that is really made applicable
1855400	1860900	due to Pokimane's significant clout and the fact that she doesn't know what he's going through.
1860900	1862600	Words come back to haunt you.
1862600	1864700	And that's one of the problems that seem apparent.
1864700	1870100	We've walked down this spiralling road of drama and Pokimane is still stuck at square one.
1870100	1874500	And it seemed that with every livestream, every discussion, every time she made a point,
1874500	1877000	she just seemed to lose more and more credibility,
1877000	1882000	because she wants to accept some of the criticism, but at the same time, she still feels she has a case.
1882000	1883600	And I feel she does, in a way.
1883600	1887800	But unfortunately, she would be constantly undone by some of the legitimate hypocrisy
1887800	1890000	displayed due to lack of justification.
1890000	1893400	Pokimane wants to play both teams, but ends up playing neither,
1893400	1897200	because she wants to both submit to the points and yet counter them.
1897200	1901500	When she does try to justify herself, they can feel like they're unnecessary.
1901500	1906100	One of the very weird techniques that I observed Pokimane partake in throughout the drama
1906100	1910600	was this sort of response, where she appeared to agree with the point being made against her,
1910600	1914900	but at the same time, she words it in a way that makes it sound like she's rebutting it.
1914900	1917000	A great example of this is here.
1917000	1920000	He sent a copyright strike, right?
1920000	1921900	Yes, it was a strike, not a claim.
1921900	1925900	My suggestion was, like, I personally think it would have been a better idea
1925900	1927600	had she DM'd you on Twitter and said,
1927600	1931000	Yo, Bowblax, would you mind taking down this video?
1931000	1934000	So then it means she can get what she wants, obviously the video taken down,
1934000	1936100	and then you don't get a copyright strike to your channel.
1936100	1940100	Just like some form of contact before initiating that, you know what I mean?
1940100	1941800	I totally get your point.
1941800	1945100	I would like to say, I think, if I'm remembering correctly,
1945100	1948800	I mentioned this to Bowblax and DMs way later,
1948800	1955800	that I wasn't fully aware about the situation and how copy strikes affected someone's channel.
1955800	1963300	I was under the assumption that full-on strikes are what take down a channel once you get three,
1963300	1968600	and I thought that it was different to copy strike a video than to strike an entire channel.
1968600	1972100	What we see here is basically Poki saying she was ignorant,
1972100	1976900	but wording it in a way as if that is a defence against the point that Fainted made,
1976900	1980200	rather than just saying that as a multi-million subscriber channel,
1980200	1983200	she probably shouldn't have been that ignorant in the first place,
1983200	1985500	which is the point that a lot of people were making.
1985500	1988200	And I'm not sure she's entirely aware she's doing it,
1988200	1991700	a lot of processes in our reasoning are rather subconscious,
1991700	1996100	but this sort of technique will always rub people the wrong way because of how it appears.
1996100	1997700	But you see the point I'm making here.
1997700	2001500	On one hand, you have Fainted, who in spite of the possible flaws of argumentation,
2001500	2005800	has resented points in an articulate, systematic, and firm way,
2005800	2009500	and on the other, you have Pokimane, who, whether there are points there or not,
2009500	2014400	fall through because she can't seem to compartmentalise criticism into specifics,
2014400	2017200	and ends up just spray-firing her defences.
2017200	2019800	And honestly, the stream highlights that difference.
2019800	2024000	When you put these two people against each other, the contrast is so vast,
2024000	2026500	and this is the power of critical commentary.
2026500	2030300	When you've done this for a while, it just puts you in a different league.
2030300	2035000	A majority of the reason that Pokimane was called out, on top of the copyright strike,
2035000	2038900	was her hypocrisy, and to bring it back to my first point of the video,
2038900	2043500	I'm sure many of you guys won't be surprised to find out that it's fairly easy to point out
2043500	2045200	hypocrisy in many of the Twitch streamers.
2045200	2050000	Pretty much anyone who doesn't spend an hour a day evaluating their morality.
2050000	2053900	It doesn't mean they're bad people, it just means they're not always thinking about it,
2053900	2057000	and it's just a case of when they're put into that rotation.
2057000	2061400	Many people from other genres just don't think about it, and we commentators do.
2061400	2065500	And I don't think that's a bad thing, there's nothing wrong with pushing for consistency,
2065500	2068700	but it is a difference, and one that has to be accepted.
2068700	2074200	And I don't dislike Pokimane, because maybe people like Jake Paul and RiceGum have done terrible stuff,
2074200	2078800	and they barely address it at all, and Pokimane tried to come forward and try to hit it,
2078800	2084100	and she was just out of her depth in trying to retrospectively explain a morality
2084100	2087900	that she knows she probably didn't think too much about at the time.
2087900	2091700	But at the same time, in her head, she feels that she's a good person, and I understand that.
2091700	2094700	But unfortunately, that's just the way the cookie crumbles.
2094700	2098800	You see, you can't justify what you already deem unjustifiable,
2098800	2102200	and you can't defend what you've already deemed to be indefensible,
2102200	2106300	and you can't rationalize what you've deemed to be irrational.
2106300	2109300	So to finish, responding to commentators is risky business.
2109300	2111900	The reason I don't do these videos on people like RiceGum
2111900	2114900	is because they don't care about their reputation when they respond.
2114900	2117700	Pokimane clearly does. So I'll leave these points.
2117700	2122000	Make sure your responses are tight, make sure people know exactly what points you're addressing,
2122000	2127000	make sure you use evidence very clearly, make sure you work out the concessions that they make,
2127000	2131200	and points that you might agree on, such as the point that Dav Sev is an annoying twat,
2131200	2136400	and then work out how you can use those agreements or premises to bring that person around
2136400	2141200	to your in-the-moment perspective, even if complete agreement is not quite possible.
2141200	2144400	That is the summary of wisdom that I can leave you with today,
2144400	2148200	and I hope you can take something away from it if you are indeed watching.
2149200	2152000	So yeah, that was the video, once again.
2152000	2156200	Very, very impressive. Thank you, guys, for the support of recent.
2156200	2159000	I would love to hear your comments on the situation below,
2159000	2163800	because it was quite an interesting one, definitely one of the more split situations,
2163800	2168400	where a lot of it just came down to how you speak, and I love those situations,
2168400	2174800	because it's really interesting how people's perspectives are actually much more shaped sometimes
2175000	2178800	by how someone presents their point, rather than what points they have.
2178800	2181000	And so, I love investigating these.
2181000	2185200	I wanna give a big shout-out to my editors who've done another fabulous job.

2239600	2241600	Take care, guys. Love you lot.
2261600	2263600	Thanks for watching!
