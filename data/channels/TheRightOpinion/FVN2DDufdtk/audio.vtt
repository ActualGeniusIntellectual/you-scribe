00:00.000 --> 00:10.200
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

00:10.200 --> 00:15.300
And I thought we'd cover some drama that's a bit more recent, because, oh my, do we adore the drama.

00:15.300 --> 00:21.200
Now, I've covered Twitch streamers before, and I'll cover Twitch streamers again, because they are an interesting set of people,

00:21.200 --> 00:25.700
and in spite of the fact that many of them are collectivized into a category by commentators,

00:25.700 --> 00:28.400
they are all at least somewhat distinguished in what they do.

00:28.400 --> 00:35.600
In a video last year, I covered Zoe Burger, someone whose rise to meteoric stardom was paired with an equally catastrophic fall.

00:35.600 --> 00:41.500
She was an absolute magnet of drama, and one of the more sexually suggestive characters out of that legion.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.900
But at the same time, she was her own individual.

00:43.900 --> 00:49.700
She was banned off Twitch, and mainly gained infamy for antics on YouTube and the subsequent drama that yielded.

00:49.700 --> 00:54.700
On the other hand, we have female streamers who may well be considered attractive by their audience.

00:54.700 --> 01:00.800
I mean, who doesn't want to look their best on camera, but at the same time doesn't necessarily seek to exploit that.

01:00.800 --> 01:03.200
And this is where we reach Pokimane.

01:03.200 --> 01:10.400
Pokimane is someone who is established on both YouTube and Twitch, with over 2.5 million subscribers slash followers on each platform.

01:10.400 --> 01:13.000
That's something which obviously cannot be ignored.

01:13.000 --> 01:21.000
She does some gaming, she does some reaction-based videos, but overall, as people go, she's not an individual who has received exceptional controversy.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.100
This is fairly typical for most genres with a fairly undemanding audience,

01:25.100 --> 01:29.600
much less demanding than the ones who watch critical commentators like myself.

01:29.600 --> 01:35.000
Most commentators also tend to have a list of people who are controversial and easy to make videos on.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.900
This is a rotating list of people, including RiceGums, The Pools, Morgz, KSI, Deji,

01:40.900 --> 01:45.200
so maybe some of the beauty community now, maybe throw in Emma Chamberlain too.

01:45.200 --> 01:49.400
Maybe you like making thought pieces on who the next content cop is gonna be on,

01:49.400 --> 01:52.000
or even if there will be a new content cop at all.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.500
What this means is that although people will be doing shady or at least debatable actions,

01:56.500 --> 02:00.400
if people aren't focusing on them, then it'll probably pass under the radar,

02:00.400 --> 02:07.200
and a lot of creators, including the person we're going to discuss today, have been sheltered from that sort of environment until now.

02:07.200 --> 02:13.000
However, as spoken in the past, the alienation of drama can often mean that when it eventually does confront one of these people,

02:13.000 --> 02:17.400
it means they are way out of their depth with no idea of how to actually handle it.

02:17.400 --> 02:23.400
Generally, this has meant that in the history of Twitch streamers versus commentators, the Twitch streamers tend to lose.

02:23.400 --> 02:28.000
Looking back to Pyrocynical versus Zoe Burger, PewDiePie versus Alinity,

02:28.000 --> 02:31.200
and yes, in both of those situations, for example,

02:31.200 --> 02:38.100
it's fairly reasonable to argue that you could side with Pyrocynical and PewDiePie in those situations regardless of outcome.

02:38.100 --> 02:45.000
But as much as the circumstance does comprise the drama, the handling and the presentation are equally important.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.500
Another real problem is how a lot of this drama can often be perceived.

02:48.500 --> 02:52.100
Expose videos have been monopolized recently by the commentary genre,

02:52.100 --> 02:57.200
and so attempting to make any sort of response to them is the equivalent of going to play an away match.

02:57.200 --> 03:03.400
You're entering someone else's stadium and you'll be attracting their audience, even if you're responding on your own channel.

03:03.400 --> 03:08.300
One of the problems with a lot of drama is that it always feels like an us versus them situation.

03:08.300 --> 03:11.800
You really are expected to side with one of the people involved,

03:11.800 --> 03:15.700
but sometimes there is a clear moral high ground when it comes to these claims.

03:15.700 --> 03:20.300
But often, when there isn't, we have to look a bit more closer than many people choose to.

03:20.300 --> 03:25.700
The thing about drama is that whatever it yields, it can be assumed as some sort of moral standard,

03:25.700 --> 03:30.800
even though we often forget about the conclusions we make and just contradict ourselves in the future.

03:30.800 --> 03:34.500
I'm a man who does enjoy some consistency,

03:34.500 --> 03:35.200
some,

03:35.200 --> 03:39.000
because whatever disputes occur do have reputational legacies,

03:39.000 --> 03:45.700
and it's important that we're holding people to account, but not unfairly singling them out because of some subconscious bias.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.700
So let's talk about today's situation.

03:47.700 --> 03:54.300
On the 28th of December, a very small YouTuber by the name of Fainted released a video called The Dark Side of Pokimane,

03:54.300 --> 03:59.900
in which he alleged that while the public's back was turned, Pokimane had done some pretty shady stuff.

03:59.900 --> 04:05.400
I'll be breaking down the details in a moment, but like some of the most infamous streamers in the past,

04:05.400 --> 04:10.700
some of the main claims were on the notion of copyright striking, or as many people now like to call it, copy striking.

04:10.700 --> 04:16.200
Firstly, in the incident of a series of uploaded Twitter clips on a feud between her and Keemstar,

04:16.200 --> 04:20.900
and secondly, on a channel that re-uploaded stream clips of her known as Davsep.

04:20.900 --> 04:27.400
These are both fairly separate situations, but fell under the umbrella of criticism that Pokimane was facing down.

04:27.400 --> 04:30.700
When he uploaded a video, Fainted had a few hundred subscribers,

04:30.700 --> 04:34.700
but the video blew up and he's in a quite different position, it's safe to say.

04:34.700 --> 04:36.800
Everyone loves a good old success story.

04:36.800 --> 04:40.700
On top of this, Fainted's video contained multiple allegations of hypocrisy,

04:40.700 --> 04:46.700
particularly implied through the situation in which Pokimane criticized Keemstar for allegedly bullying a fan,

04:46.700 --> 04:53.500
promoting a principle that many claimed was contradicted by her behaviour towards the subjects of Fainted's video.

04:53.500 --> 05:00.100
Then a couple weeks later, on the 11th of January, PewDiePie uploaded a video with the classic title Stop Doing This,

05:00.100 --> 05:04.300
in which he requested a host of YouTubers to, well, stop doing this.

05:04.300 --> 05:09.500
This being the unwarranted copyright striking of other videos that seemingly didn't deserve them.

05:09.500 --> 05:15.000
In this list was the lady herself, Pokimane, and the fact that she had allegedly struck down the Twitter feud,

05:15.000 --> 05:20.900
which, as pointed out by PewDiePie, had been picked up by the algorithms and were being publicized,

05:20.900 --> 05:24.300
and Pokimane probably wanted to keep it out of the public eye.

05:24.300 --> 05:30.200
However, this caused a classic Streisand effect and now has the platform's largest YouTuber covering it.

05:30.200 --> 05:33.700
Well, we'll see how he's doing against T-Series by the time this video comes out.

05:33.700 --> 05:38.900
So, clearly, with a lot of allegations staring herself down, Pokimane decided to make her response video,

05:38.900 --> 05:41.300
in which she addressed some of the claims made against her.

05:41.300 --> 05:45.900
She admits some of her transgressions, but also decides to hold her ground on some points,

05:45.900 --> 05:49.600
particularly the situation regarding Davsev, which is an interesting one.

05:49.600 --> 05:54.500
She also responds directly to both PewDiePie and Fainted, including clips of their videos,

05:54.500 --> 05:59.600
which, of course, provokes an additional response from Fainted, which was mainly rebutting Pokimane's response,

05:59.600 --> 06:06.300
and some of the points that she made, kind of concluding that Pokimane's response was insufficient in the scope of actually responding,

06:06.300 --> 06:09.800
and more just a way to dodge and reframe a lot of what's going on.

06:09.800 --> 06:15.500
But is that the case? Because, honestly, watching through Fainted's initial video, I wasn't really won over.

06:15.500 --> 06:19.400
I thought it was a bit weak, but I can see why other people were won over.

06:19.400 --> 06:27.000
Equally, I don't think that any of the conclusions, necessarily, that I've observed make Pokimane a bad person, per se,

06:27.000 --> 06:33.400
but I still think she's made a huge mistake, and when your ratings are going badly, there's always a reason.

06:33.400 --> 06:37.100
So today, I don't want this to be an exposed video, it's not,

06:37.100 --> 06:41.400
but more a guide on why people might turn against you in the face of drama,

06:41.400 --> 06:46.400
and how someone who has probably never dealt with it before can take it on in the future,

06:46.400 --> 06:49.600
because, you know, that's what we do here on The Right Opinion.

06:57.000 --> 07:06.600
One of the most contentious issues on the platform is that of fair use.

07:06.600 --> 07:10.000
We have some sort of vague manga about the dos and the don'ts,

07:10.000 --> 07:15.200
but when a situation that blurs the lines comes about, it often throws the community into chaos,

07:15.200 --> 07:17.900
with no clear argument on what is actually right.

07:17.900 --> 07:22.700
On top of this, it is a really passionate topic, people care a hell of a lot,

07:22.700 --> 07:27.200
and if you're doing it unjustly, you are gonna have an uphill battle defending yourself.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.900
This is the first situation that comes about with Pokimane,

07:29.900 --> 07:33.300
because what happened, as both testified by her and fainted,

07:33.300 --> 07:38.000
is basically Keemstar was on Twitter, had an argument with some fans of another creator,

07:38.000 --> 07:40.100
the colourful character SSSniperWolf,

07:40.100 --> 07:45.000
before Pokimane stepped into the fray to go toe-to-toe with Keem in a Twitter video battle.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.100
But then a load of people contributed as well, and a load of memes,

07:48.100 --> 07:52.400
and a load of people who I'm not familiar with, because I don't use this damn site enough.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.800
Right... there.

07:54.800 --> 07:58.400
This nigga's organisation is actually kind of on fleek.

07:58.400 --> 08:02.600
The shadow's even, you can tell he's stacked up, even the angle fucking sucks.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.100
And then right here.

08:07.100 --> 08:09.000
This nigga's wires is in place.

08:09.000 --> 08:14.200
Now, after a discussion, it was assumed to be over, and many people continued with their lives.

08:14.200 --> 08:18.900
However, a compilation of this discussion was downloaded and re-uploaded onto YouTube,

08:18.900 --> 08:20.800
and it clearly caught people's attention.

08:20.800 --> 08:25.400
And because it caught people's attention, YouTube decided that it was going to blow the video up.

08:25.400 --> 08:29.700
So suddenly this drama that Pokimane probably regretted involving herself in the first place,

08:29.700 --> 08:35.300
was blowing up all over YouTube, and there was nothing she could do about it, or so people thought.

08:35.300 --> 08:39.900
Because Pokimane decided to have her company, Omnia Media, remove the video,

08:39.900 --> 08:43.100
and deal a claim onto the YouTuber known as Bowblax.

08:43.100 --> 08:46.500
Now, most people believe he received a strike straight away,

08:46.500 --> 08:52.700
but actually this was a miscommunication, and something that has been clarified recently through additional research.

08:52.700 --> 08:57.600
However, even with that said, it did eventually turn into a strike due to the appeals,

08:57.600 --> 09:02.600
and for anyone who doesn't know, a copyright strike has a significant effect on the mobility of a channel,

09:02.600 --> 09:03.800
even if it's only one.

09:03.800 --> 09:07.300
It causes a fair bit of stress, and takes a few months to expire.

09:07.300 --> 09:11.300
So on one hand, you have Fainted and PewDiePie, who call out Pokimane for doing this,

09:11.300 --> 09:14.500
of course it's annoying when something like this blows out of proportion,

09:14.500 --> 09:16.800
but such a response is rather uncalled for.

09:16.800 --> 09:20.200
So in a way, I can understand why you want to take down this video,

09:20.200 --> 09:27.700
because this selected thing blows up and becomes even bigger, thanks to YouTube's system being kind of stupid.

09:27.700 --> 09:32.600
At least I can somewhat understand the motivation of trying to take down that video.

09:32.600 --> 09:38.400
But the problem here, and the same problem that goes with every single example that I brought up in this video,

09:38.400 --> 09:41.000
is that you're just drawing more attention to it.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.100
It's a Streisand effect every single time.

09:43.100 --> 09:47.900
Pokimane responds to them saying that although she felt perfectly within legal right to remove the video,

09:47.900 --> 09:51.700
she understands that it was a morally problematic decision to take.

09:51.700 --> 09:56.900
Although I was legally within my right to take down the video, morally, and as a content creator,

09:56.900 --> 09:59.900
it wasn't something that I should have done, because, I mean, at the end of the day,

09:59.900 --> 10:04.100
those were tweets that me and Keem made publicly, and videos that we made publicly.

10:04.100 --> 10:09.000
Fainted then disputes this using his commentary credentials by citing a Keemstar tweet.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.200
And you know what, I'm not even gonna bother giving my opinions on this, we'll just leave that to the man himself, Keemstar.

10:13.200 --> 10:16.000
Pokimane, I think you're confused on what transformative means.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.800
The video where they played both our Twitter vids was transformative because it's a collage of multiple clips.

10:20.800 --> 10:25.800
There's case law on this. It's not a direct upload, like you stated, you could get sued for false flagging.

10:25.800 --> 10:31.200
This gave me the impression that he seemed to think that the video was fair use because it was in a compilation format.

10:31.200 --> 10:35.300
And so I want to put this on hold for a moment, because I notice a problem in the reasoning.

10:35.300 --> 10:41.500
Firstly, I think, contrary to my friend's belief here, that actually Pokimane was completely in her quote,

10:41.500 --> 10:47.300
legal rights to remove the video, even though there is some sort of claim that this has been put to test in the courts.

10:47.300 --> 10:52.100
I cannot find it, and I highly doubt a compilation of clips would be considered fair use,

10:52.100 --> 10:57.500
considering some of the other cases, even if they're done in a way that shows a chronologically arranged discussion,

10:57.500 --> 11:00.100
which could be considered part of the transformation.

11:00.100 --> 11:03.900
Dealing with fair use is incredibly complicated, we know where the extremes lie,

11:03.900 --> 11:07.200
we know that Chris Stutman's film reviews are almost certainly fair use,

11:07.200 --> 11:11.100
and we know that re-uploads of Coldplay songs are most likely not fair use.

11:11.100 --> 11:15.800
But a lot of the content falls in between, and therefore the only way to resolve this is through the courts.

11:15.800 --> 11:20.800
Either way, fair use or not, I find this whole debacle to be a bit of a non-argument,

11:20.800 --> 11:24.600
and if Pokimane was taken to court over this, I think she'd win.

11:24.600 --> 11:29.800
But here's the thing, just because something is legally accepted doesn't mean we should accept it.

11:29.800 --> 11:33.000
Laws are typically based off some sort of moral foundations,

11:33.000 --> 11:38.800
and therefore when Pokimane accepted the regards of legality her move was morally dubious,

11:38.800 --> 11:41.800
it should have technically invalidated her argument,

11:41.800 --> 11:45.400
because generally we perceive ourselves on the basis of morality,

11:45.400 --> 11:49.200
and therefore if she actively did something that she's aware was immoral,

11:49.200 --> 11:54.200
then legality only exists as a technical defense to avoid being sued.

11:54.200 --> 11:57.400
Just because something's legal does not make it moral,

11:57.400 --> 12:00.400
and therefore means we shouldn't necessarily accept it.

12:00.400 --> 12:03.600
Laws themselves exist for that reason.

12:03.600 --> 12:06.800
For the betterment of society, what do we build the laws on?

12:06.800 --> 12:08.800
We build those laws on principles.

12:08.800 --> 12:14.600
Laws are partly built on morals, and we're always debating what should and should not be changed.

12:14.600 --> 12:20.800
If you can't morally justify your actions, then the fact that it's legal does not serve as a defense,

12:20.800 --> 12:23.600
other than, of course, in court.

12:23.600 --> 12:27.800
But audiences are not jurors, they're just people who have opinions.

12:27.800 --> 12:31.800
The thing is, that although I'm generally against re-uploaded content,

12:31.800 --> 12:38.200
I feel that these circumstances make the situation much more of an archiving of a conversation that occurred.

12:38.200 --> 12:43.800
Trying to mute what unfortunately happened and could have been archived any other way is where the issue lies,

12:43.800 --> 12:49.800
and I don't think that was a reasonable action on her part, and I think me and her can agree there now.

12:49.800 --> 12:54.000
And this is one other thing, she uses this term in a way that I would call a passive defense.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.200
Basically, she doesn't run the point as if it's counter to her position on the situation,

12:58.200 --> 12:59.800
or the point she's trying to make.

12:59.800 --> 13:04.600
She still concedes, apologizes, and admits she was wrong, and fair play for that.

13:04.600 --> 13:09.800
Although I was legally within my right to take down the video, morally, and as a content creator,

13:09.800 --> 13:12.800
it wasn't something that I should have done, because, I mean, at the end of the day,

13:12.800 --> 13:17.200
those were tweets that me and Keem made publicly, and videos that we made publicly,

13:17.200 --> 13:24.200
so I totally apologize for that, and I spoke to the guy who made those videos, like, a few weeks back,

13:24.200 --> 13:26.400
and we had resolved all of this in DMs.

13:26.400 --> 13:30.800
However, because she made the point, Fainted can extract it and run against it,

13:30.800 --> 13:34.400
and as a passive defense, her video really could have done without it.

13:34.400 --> 13:39.900
A passive defense is only really utilized as a rhetorical device to demonstrate reasonability,

13:39.900 --> 13:42.300
and I think that's what Poki was trying to do here.

13:42.300 --> 13:47.300
The problem is that when you're defending yourself, a passive defense has to explain your mindset,

13:47.300 --> 13:50.600
rather than necessarily justifying your ability to commit the action.

13:50.600 --> 13:51.900
For example, I say,

13:51.900 --> 13:53.600
I'm sorry for shouting at that lady.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.900
I was drunk and depressed, but it was completely wrong on me.

13:56.900 --> 13:57.700
Rather than,

13:57.700 --> 13:59.600
I'm sorry for shouting at that lady.

13:59.600 --> 14:03.800
I was, well, within my rights to do it, but it was completely wrong nonetheless.

14:03.800 --> 14:08.600
Because it's a moral issue, the way I've worded the second explanation sounds like a scapegoat,

14:08.600 --> 14:13.800
because it sounds like I've shifted part responsibility onto the legal system for allowing me to do it,

14:13.800 --> 14:17.300
and that's where you have to be very careful on how it comes across.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.900
I find Pokimane's response genuinely interesting,

14:19.900 --> 14:24.000
because I think it's one of the first ones that clearly have the correct base formula down.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.600
When responding to something that you know is wrong, it's important to admit your mistakes,

14:27.600 --> 14:31.900
but at the same time, try to make sure the audience can empathize with the mindset you're in,

14:31.900 --> 14:35.400
and she does appear to attempt that and lay that structure down,

14:35.400 --> 14:37.300
but she just pulls the wrong points in.

14:37.300 --> 14:41.800
There is a right way and a wrong way to justify yourself, and this tends to lean the wrong way.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.800
This is a problem particularly evident throughout Pokimane's response.

14:44.800 --> 14:49.300
The emphasis of her points do not reflect the points that are of interest to the audience.

14:49.300 --> 14:52.400
Everything that might be relevant seems rather brushed over.

14:52.400 --> 14:56.200
I don't think it's her intent, but it can come across as rather dismissive.

14:56.200 --> 15:01.500
Equally, I don't think it's her intent to necessarily misframe the claims being made against her,

15:02.600 --> 15:03.500
but...

15:04.000 --> 15:09.500
Some people were saying that I pulled up his, like, personal Instagram and made fun of him or something.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.800
So what she does is honestly pretty evil.

15:12.800 --> 15:17.400
Poki finds Dabsev's personal Instagram page, and then just laughing at pictures of him.

15:17.400 --> 15:22.400
He had his Instagram linked in the description of the videos that he was posting,

15:22.400 --> 15:25.100
so it was not like a personal or private Instagram.

15:25.100 --> 15:26.700
I didn't attack the way that he looked,

15:26.700 --> 15:29.900
and obviously he was watching my stream while he was on the call with me,

15:29.900 --> 15:31.900
and he saw that I was looking at his Instagram.

15:31.900 --> 15:34.300
He said, do you like what you see?

15:34.300 --> 15:36.800
Showing off all this stuff.

15:36.800 --> 15:42.000
Yeah, I don't like people trying to make it seem like I would go to someone's Instagram with alien intent

15:42.000 --> 15:43.700
just to, like, bash on them.

15:43.700 --> 15:46.200
Hey, hold on a minute. What kind of cutting was that, bro?

15:46.200 --> 15:48.200
She just completely cut up my point.

15:48.200 --> 15:52.700
Poki finds Dabsev's personal Instagram page, and then just laughing at pictures of him.

15:52.700 --> 15:54.100
Let me show you what it actually looked like,

15:54.100 --> 15:57.400
and then you can probably guess why Pokimane didn't include that in her video.

15:57.400 --> 16:00.200
Poki finds Dabsev's personal Instagram page,

16:00.200 --> 16:05.300
and literally starts looking through it and laughing at it in front of thousands of viewers.

16:05.300 --> 16:08.800
Problem here is that she's gone into it like a lot of public figures.

16:08.800 --> 16:13.100
They come from a genre where optics and wording don't seem like a big deal,

16:13.100 --> 16:15.100
and suddenly making vague statements,

16:15.100 --> 16:18.300
it's fairly easy for a commentator like Fainted,

16:18.300 --> 16:21.200
who I don't even rate as an argumentation expert.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.800
You have to be specific.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.600
You have to be clear with what you mean,

16:24.600 --> 16:29.600
and you cannot misframe the situation to be disproportionately sympathetic to your case,

16:29.600 --> 16:32.300
or disproportionately harsh against another person,

16:32.300 --> 16:36.200
because there is nobody who will pick that up like the commentators.

16:36.200 --> 16:39.000
I think this is a really important learning experience

16:39.000 --> 16:42.400
that we should definitely take forward going into the second situation.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.400
...

16:44.400 --> 16:46.400
...

16:46.400 --> 16:48.400
...

16:48.400 --> 16:50.400
...

16:50.400 --> 16:52.400
...

16:52.400 --> 16:54.400
...

16:54.400 --> 16:56.400
...

16:56.400 --> 17:00.800
Thing about the Dabsev situation is that if Pokimane had approached it correctly,

17:00.800 --> 17:02.400
then she could have been in the clear.

17:02.400 --> 17:07.000
This is the real pivotal situation that galvanised a lot of the drama,

17:07.000 --> 17:09.700
and to completely apprehend how to respond,

17:09.700 --> 17:15.100
she kinda had to understand exactly what people's objections were to the original scenario,

17:15.100 --> 17:19.100
and once again, Fainted, on one hand, had a much harder sell.

17:19.100 --> 17:21.500
Dabsev was clearly an annoying twat,

17:21.500 --> 17:26.700
and frankly, people are not inclined to side with someone they may perceive as an annoying twat.

17:26.700 --> 17:28.700
...

17:28.700 --> 17:30.700
...

17:30.700 --> 17:32.700
...

17:32.700 --> 17:34.700
...

17:34.700 --> 17:36.700
...

17:36.700 --> 17:38.700
...

17:38.700 --> 17:40.700
...

17:40.700 --> 17:42.700
...

17:42.700 --> 17:44.700
...

17:44.700 --> 17:46.700
...

17:46.700 --> 17:48.700
...

17:48.700 --> 17:50.700
...

17:50.700 --> 17:54.700
The thing Fainted very smartly did was not side with Dabsev.

17:54.700 --> 18:01.700
Not necessarily defending Dabsev, he knew that if Pokimane decided to try and couple him to Dabsev in any sort of way,

18:01.700 --> 18:05.100
then he could object and point out the flaw in her argument,

18:05.100 --> 18:09.100
because Pokimane didn't pay close enough attention to respond meticulously.

18:09.100 --> 18:12.500
She makes some very vague claims and thus suffers because of them,

18:12.500 --> 18:15.900
even though with better wording, she could have really put it to bed.

18:15.900 --> 18:20.100
At this point in the discussion, I think everybody can agree that Pokimane is in the right here,

18:20.100 --> 18:23.500
because of course, if this guy's proud of the fact that he's uploading clickbait videos,

18:23.500 --> 18:25.300
it kind of tells us a lot about his character.

18:25.300 --> 18:31.300
So if the video he's uploaded consists of literally just a stream clip nabbed from her livestream,

18:31.300 --> 18:35.700
then in that case, I think she went 100% as the right to take down the video.

18:35.700 --> 18:40.300
But because, once again, she focuses on one issue which she doesn't really respond to properly,

18:40.300 --> 18:44.100
she first cuts Fainted's clip-up in a way that changes the message.

18:44.100 --> 18:47.900
Now, whether she wanted to do that for efficiency or not is besides the point.

18:47.900 --> 18:50.300
It came across as twisting information.

18:50.300 --> 18:56.300
Equally, it's really important to not be distracted by the general representation of the points.

18:56.300 --> 19:00.900
Fainted may be a smaller YouTuber, but right now, he is the one with the momentum,

19:00.900 --> 19:06.300
and therefore, if you want to respond to him, you have to make sure his arguments are being communicated properly,

19:06.300 --> 19:08.700
and that equally, you make sure there's no confusion.

19:08.700 --> 19:10.300
For example, this earlier clip.

19:10.300 --> 19:16.900
And people have been using clips from that livestream to try to make it look like I randomly take down videos whenever I want,

19:16.900 --> 19:20.900
or I do that commonly when it's definitely not the case.

19:20.900 --> 19:22.900
Right, so now Daddy Fainted's getting called out.

19:22.900 --> 19:26.900
I'm pretty sure in my video, I never mentioned anything about her frequently taking down videos.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.900
My video is focused on your hypocrisy.

19:28.900 --> 19:34.700
Now, as noted, Fainted lays claim that this clip is about him, but Poki never actively says it is,

19:34.700 --> 19:39.100
and there's fair evidence to assume that, from other YouTubers, this narrative isn't rare.

19:39.100 --> 19:43.500
So it's very possible that Poki caught other videos or comments from people,

19:43.500 --> 19:48.300
but because she put it in her title that she's responding to the dark side of Pokimane,

19:48.300 --> 19:53.900
it implies that this is a narrative that is local to his video, even though it's not.

19:53.900 --> 20:01.700
It is actually a general narrative that is somewhat existent in other YouTubers who have made videos and got decent views.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.500
Pokimane recently seems to be going around doing a lot of scummy things, pretty much.

20:04.500 --> 20:09.300
She's striking out a bunch of smaller creators, she's making people cry in front of 20,000 people right on stream,

20:09.300 --> 20:11.300
and she's honestly just, you know, a thought.

20:11.300 --> 20:17.100
I want to put it out there that I never knowingly take down a video that is transformative content.

20:17.100 --> 20:23.100
I would not take down videos that people have spent time, like, creating commentary for,

20:23.100 --> 20:26.100
and editing and producing together, I don't think that's fair at all.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.700
And obviously that's why there's tons of videos out there,

20:28.700 --> 20:30.700
Twitch compilations where I'm still in them,

20:30.700 --> 20:32.700
or critiques of me or drama,

20:32.700 --> 20:36.700
or videos that I'm in that are positive or negative that I don't take down.

20:36.700 --> 20:39.500
Now, I say this because she uses the phrase people.

20:39.500 --> 20:43.500
Fainted is not people, Fainted is a person, as far as I know.

20:43.500 --> 20:49.500
And I think we can deduce here that once again she's trying to address a different narrative being pushed by certain YouTubers.

20:49.500 --> 20:54.500
The problem is when you put someone's video title in your title, it sounds like you're addressing them.

20:54.500 --> 20:59.100
Fainted had no real right to lay claim to that comment other than that fact.

20:59.100 --> 21:04.900
It would have been narcissistic to assume that his video was the only one that promoted a narrative like that.

21:04.900 --> 21:10.700
Equally by addressing some narratives and overlooking others, it just seems like she's dancing around certain points,

21:10.700 --> 21:13.900
and honestly she didn't really need to address Fainted at all,

21:13.900 --> 21:18.300
especially when she only brings up the situation about how it's being framed.

21:18.300 --> 21:24.100
And one of the biggest problems is when you bring up the question of optics and not just the direct situation,

21:24.100 --> 21:25.700
it becomes very, very sketchy.

21:25.700 --> 21:30.900
The only thing that she actively goes out of her way to address Fainted on is the Instagram situation,

21:30.900 --> 21:34.700
and once again, if you can explain why you did this barely enough, easy picking.

21:34.700 --> 21:38.500
You're pissed off that someone has taken your content, being an irritating bastard,

21:38.500 --> 21:41.900
and so to elicit your perception of justice against this davsev twat,

21:41.900 --> 21:44.500
you think that he deserves to get the piss taken out of him,

21:44.500 --> 21:49.300
and so you go airing all your dirty laundry on the stream, and you admit that you went a bit too far,

21:49.300 --> 21:51.700
and you know what? That's pretty much what she said,

21:51.700 --> 21:56.300
and probably why Fainted doesn't bother addressing that part, because the majority of it is fairly agreeable.

21:56.300 --> 22:01.100
The point of this is just to say that was an entirely different scenario and situation,

22:01.100 --> 22:04.300
where I was well within my right to take down his content,

22:04.500 --> 22:07.900
but also in that moment and on that live stream.

22:07.900 --> 22:10.300
Like, I shouldn't have had that conversation on stream,

22:10.300 --> 22:13.700
and it definitely was a moment of frustration.

22:13.700 --> 22:17.100
That shouldn't have been, like, publicized in that way, for sure.

22:17.100 --> 22:19.100
But then she ends up at this point.

22:19.100 --> 22:24.100
He had his Instagram linked in the description of the videos that he was posting,

22:24.100 --> 22:26.900
so it was not like a personal or private Instagram.

22:26.900 --> 22:28.500
I didn't attack the way that he looked,

22:28.500 --> 22:31.700
and obviously he was watching my stream while he was on the call with me,

22:31.700 --> 22:33.700
and he saw that I was looking at his Instagram.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.900
He said, do you like what you see?

22:35.900 --> 22:39.900
And once again, we end up in a situation of how someone was allowed to do something,

22:39.900 --> 22:42.900
the notion that she found his personal Instagram page,

22:42.900 --> 22:44.700
because it was linked in the description.

22:44.700 --> 22:47.500
And honestly, once again, her point is not wrong.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.900
She can do what she wants.

22:48.900 --> 22:54.300
The fact that Davsev is a YouTuber, an adult, putting content on a public platform,

22:54.300 --> 22:58.300
and therefore any links he posts as public may be picked up by anyone.

22:58.300 --> 23:04.100
But it sounds like Pokimane interpreted the point against her as if she was doxing someone,

23:04.100 --> 23:08.100
rather than actually necessarily the point that Fainted was trying to make.

23:08.100 --> 23:11.100
Okay, so this is the one part of the video that does kind of trigger me a little bit.

23:11.100 --> 23:16.100
So in Pokimane's logic, just because Davsev had his Instagram linked on one of his Twitch compilations,

23:16.100 --> 23:20.500
that gives her the right to display his Instagram in front of thousands of people on her Twitch stream,

23:20.500 --> 23:26.700
someone who she openly dislikes and actually states earlier on in the stream is what is wrong with this world.

23:26.700 --> 23:29.700
So, you know, clearly giving off some great vibes towards this guy

23:29.700 --> 23:32.700
and encouraging her fans to send him lots of positive comments, right?

23:32.700 --> 23:35.700
If people who don't like him want to take the piss out of him, they can go for it.

23:35.700 --> 23:38.700
I mean, hell, that's what people like Leafy did for a career,

23:38.700 --> 23:41.100
and they went after much more vulnerable targets.

23:41.100 --> 23:46.500
The point that Fainted was making was that it was rather distasteful to go out of your way to make fun of someone

23:46.500 --> 23:53.300
and expose them to that heat, especially when you have that power to really cause some potential harassment against them.

23:53.300 --> 23:57.500
Once again, something that you've already admitted with a fairly heated gamer moment,

23:57.500 --> 24:02.700
you're then arguing on the technicality, the one that really wasn't being argued in the first place.

24:02.700 --> 24:05.100
Honestly, if Poki had just turned around and said,

24:05.100 --> 24:08.100
Yep, he got what he deserved, she may have come out looking better.

24:08.100 --> 24:12.100
And the only reason she can't really say that is because of the argument she had with Keemstar,

24:12.100 --> 24:14.900
where she took that moral position against bullying.

24:14.900 --> 24:17.900
And yes, you can see the parallels between the situations,

24:17.900 --> 24:21.700
and if she really wanted to work out how to make a proper response in that instance,

24:21.700 --> 24:27.700
she would have had to work out how to correctly express the distinction between that situation and this one.

24:27.700 --> 24:31.100
And that is the only way you can respond to something like hypocrisy.

24:31.100 --> 24:34.500
I think Poki genuinely wanted to try and have an open discussion,

24:34.500 --> 24:37.100
but the main point that she continuously made was that,

24:37.100 --> 24:40.700
I shouldn't have done that, but it was in my rights to.

24:40.700 --> 24:44.500
Which is not a good argument. You have to just say,

24:44.500 --> 24:47.900
Honestly, I was pissed off, because it's okay to be pissed off.

24:47.900 --> 24:49.700
We're all human, we get annoyed.

24:49.700 --> 24:53.700
If someone was re-uploading my uploads, I'd be annoyed too.

24:53.700 --> 24:57.300
Because, in many ways, that's what you seem to express, Poki.

24:57.300 --> 25:00.700
I'm making somewhat irrelevant points that are meant to serve as a defense,

25:00.700 --> 25:06.100
actually tend to serve as a distraction from what could have been a genuinely decent response video.

25:15.100 --> 25:18.500
This whole situation is a classic example of why commentators,

25:18.500 --> 25:21.300
even if their arguments aren't the most watertight at first,

25:21.300 --> 25:25.500
seem to keep winning these confrontations with YouTubers from other genres.

25:25.500 --> 25:29.900
I actually don't think many of Feint's arguments were on closer inspection that strong,

25:29.900 --> 25:32.900
and if we wanted to pull up one example, we can pull up the clickbait one.

25:32.900 --> 25:34.700
I'm not sure you guys are gonna like this.

25:34.700 --> 25:42.500
Chat, what do I say to make him realize that it's an asshole thing to falsely clickbait someone else?

25:42.500 --> 25:50.100
Okay, so basically, Pokimane just cannot stand on her two feet and say that she is against clickbait content on YouTube.

25:50.100 --> 25:53.900
She essentially collabed with a YouTuber who goes by the name of ShotgunPlays,

25:53.900 --> 25:55.900
but realistically, he should be called,

25:55.900 --> 25:58.900
I sound like I'm eating a chicken legend every time I speak.

26:03.500 --> 26:06.300
And the reason this is a problem is because, by playing with this dude,

26:06.300 --> 26:08.300
she essentially was supporting his content,

26:08.300 --> 26:12.500
and 90% of the stuff that he uploads is straight-up misleading clickbait,

26:12.500 --> 26:15.700
so I don't really know what Poki's doing playing with this dude, honestly.

26:17.500 --> 26:18.700
By supporting this guy's videos,

26:18.700 --> 26:23.300
it just means that she can't go out of her way to suggest that someone else making clickbait content isn't cool,

26:23.300 --> 26:29.100
because girl, I'm sorry, but you've supported probably the biggest Fortnite clickbait YouTuber.

26:29.100 --> 26:35.300
Firstly, Pokimane, in her original situation, says it's an asshole thing to do to clickbait quote someone else.

26:35.300 --> 26:43.300
Chat, what do I say to make him realize that it's an asshole thing to falsely clickbait someone else?

26:43.300 --> 26:46.300
Clickbaiting Fortnite is not necessarily comparable,

26:46.300 --> 26:49.500
and even if Pokimane didn't express that point in the best way,

26:49.500 --> 26:54.300
we can see why she takes issue with someone using another person's ass in the thumbnail,

26:54.300 --> 26:57.700
and not necessarily taking issue with people clickbaiting Fortnite.

26:57.700 --> 27:03.500
Oh my god, you put somebody else's butt on a thingy of me.

27:03.700 --> 27:07.500
Like, there is a clear difference there, a clear moral dissonance.

27:07.500 --> 27:13.700
Now that's just one argument, and the point of this video is not to go through every single Point of Fainted's videos,

27:13.700 --> 27:20.500
and I agree with some, I disagree with others, I'm going to leave the direct ones to my good friend BWC, check his video out.

27:20.500 --> 27:24.500
There were points that could have been made on Pokimane's behalf, but they slipped through the cracks,

27:24.500 --> 27:27.900
because she clearly lacked the expertise to deal with the drama,

27:27.900 --> 27:33.100
mainly because once again, Pokimane honestly wasn't specific enough with the point she was making,

27:33.100 --> 27:35.700
and often wavered on what she was trying to say.

27:35.700 --> 27:41.300
On one hand, she must have cared enough to think about what points she was trying to respond to,

27:41.300 --> 27:44.900
but didn't seem to care enough to specify or provide further evidence,

27:44.900 --> 27:48.500
which is a standard that a lot of commentary audiences are ravenous for.

27:48.500 --> 27:54.500
When I make my videos, I'm consistently returning to drafts of my videos and telling myself to use more clips.

27:54.500 --> 27:59.900
Use more evidence, it's a demanding genre, you have to pay attention to the surrounding culture.

27:59.900 --> 28:06.500
Audiences on concept tend to have a bit of a bad taste regarding Twitch streamers, due to previous incidents,

28:06.500 --> 28:10.100
and then you have this commentator, Fainted, who is the underdog,

28:10.100 --> 28:13.900
and therefore many neutral viewers will like someone punching up,

28:13.900 --> 28:17.300
and so if you make any comments that seem misrepresentative,

28:17.300 --> 28:22.100
people will take that idea that this is the larger YouTuber trying to shut down the smaller one,

28:22.100 --> 28:25.700
because they're the ones with that perceived power.

28:25.700 --> 28:30.300
One of the most common criticisms levied against larger YouTubers is hypocrisy,

28:30.300 --> 28:32.900
and the reason people do it because it's easy.

28:32.900 --> 28:37.900
Creators like Pokimane will make statements day in and day out and will forget them the day after.

28:37.900 --> 28:44.300
Comments will be made on whimsical sentiments, so it's easy to find one or two situations that contradict themselves.

28:44.300 --> 28:49.100
If you want to be a moral advocate in the community, you need nuance.

28:49.100 --> 28:53.100
The problem with lack of nuance is that, as said, you end up creating standards

28:53.100 --> 28:59.300
that you yourself will inevitably fail to live up to, especially if you use vague arguments to justify it.

28:59.300 --> 29:04.900
If you fail to distinguish the morality of situations that may seem similar on the surface,

29:04.900 --> 29:09.100
you will inevitably look like a hypocrite, and people will point that out.

29:09.100 --> 29:14.500
I do not think Pokimane is a malicious person. Matter of fact, I quite like her,

29:14.500 --> 29:20.900
but it's clear through this situation she has revealed herself to be extremely naive, even dangerously naive.

29:20.900 --> 29:25.300
I mean, when she admits she doesn't understand the copyright system on YouTube.

29:25.300 --> 29:28.500
...before I took it, before it was taken down.

29:28.500 --> 29:29.300
No.

29:29.300 --> 29:29.900
I was suggesting...

29:29.900 --> 29:31.800
Contact him for what?

29:31.800 --> 29:35.100
I was just thinking, like, maybe...

29:35.100 --> 29:37.700
With the whole strike system, I don't know if you're aware on YouTube,

29:37.700 --> 29:41.200
it's pretty bad for a channel for them to get a proper copyright strike.

29:41.200 --> 29:44.100
You can only get three and then your channel's deleted, so I was just thinking...

29:44.100 --> 29:47.800
I believe that's a strike and not a copy strike.

29:47.800 --> 29:49.500
It can be a copy strike.

29:49.500 --> 29:52.100
You are a huge, huge influencer.

29:52.100 --> 29:55.700
You have to look into the consequences that your actions might have,

29:55.700 --> 29:58.500
after saying that you don't know what someone's going through.

29:58.500 --> 30:01.900
On top of this, as mentioned, Pokimane didn't actually strike,

30:01.900 --> 30:07.000
but had Omnia deliver a claim which turned into a strike when Bowblax appealed it.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.500
Once again, this information makes Pokimane seem much less malicious,

30:11.500 --> 30:13.900
but if she'd had more investment in the situation,

30:13.900 --> 30:18.300
she would have been able to find this out and then put this case forward for herself,

30:18.300 --> 30:21.300
rather than necessarily having other people bring it forward.

30:21.300 --> 30:24.900
So this is, once again, revealing of that naivety.

30:24.900 --> 30:27.300
And consequences are a two-way street.

30:27.300 --> 30:30.200
And with the Dafsev situation, he came into your stream,

30:30.200 --> 30:33.100
spammed the chat with a load of bullshit scam links,

30:33.100 --> 30:37.200
directly uploaded content that wasn't his, had all his links public.

30:37.200 --> 30:41.500
He must have had some awareness that his actions have consequences, too.

30:41.500 --> 30:45.000
He must have anticipated this as a 17-year-old.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.400
And frankly, I find it extremely hard to sympathise with him.

30:48.400 --> 30:51.200
It may not be the route that I would have taken in dealing with it,

30:51.200 --> 30:55.400
but the framing of him as some kind of victim is one that is really made applicable

30:55.400 --> 31:00.900
due to Pokimane's significant clout and the fact that she doesn't know what he's going through.

31:00.900 --> 31:02.600
Words come back to haunt you.

31:02.600 --> 31:04.700
And that's one of the problems that seem apparent.

31:04.700 --> 31:10.100
We've walked down this spiralling road of drama and Pokimane is still stuck at square one.

31:10.100 --> 31:14.500
And it seemed that with every livestream, every discussion, every time she made a point,

31:14.500 --> 31:17.000
she just seemed to lose more and more credibility,

31:17.000 --> 31:22.000
because she wants to accept some of the criticism, but at the same time, she still feels she has a case.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.600
And I feel she does, in a way.

31:23.600 --> 31:27.800
But unfortunately, she would be constantly undone by some of the legitimate hypocrisy

31:27.800 --> 31:30.000
displayed due to lack of justification.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.400
Pokimane wants to play both teams, but ends up playing neither,

31:33.400 --> 31:37.200
because she wants to both submit to the points and yet counter them.

31:37.200 --> 31:41.500
When she does try to justify herself, they can feel like they're unnecessary.

31:41.500 --> 31:46.100
One of the very weird techniques that I observed Pokimane partake in throughout the drama

31:46.100 --> 31:50.600
was this sort of response, where she appeared to agree with the point being made against her,

31:50.600 --> 31:54.900
but at the same time, she words it in a way that makes it sound like she's rebutting it.

31:54.900 --> 31:57.000
A great example of this is here.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
He sent a copyright strike, right?

32:00.000 --> 32:01.900
Yes, it was a strike, not a claim.

32:01.900 --> 32:05.900
My suggestion was, like, I personally think it would have been a better idea

32:05.900 --> 32:07.600
had she DM'd you on Twitter and said,

32:07.600 --> 32:11.000
Yo, Bowblax, would you mind taking down this video?

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
So then it means she can get what she wants, obviously the video taken down,

32:14.000 --> 32:16.100
and then you don't get a copyright strike to your channel.

32:16.100 --> 32:20.100
Just like some form of contact before initiating that, you know what I mean?

32:20.100 --> 32:21.800
I totally get your point.

32:21.800 --> 32:25.100
I would like to say, I think, if I'm remembering correctly,

32:25.100 --> 32:28.800
I mentioned this to Bowblax and DMs way later,

32:28.800 --> 32:35.800
that I wasn't fully aware about the situation and how copy strikes affected someone's channel.

32:35.800 --> 32:43.300
I was under the assumption that full-on strikes are what take down a channel once you get three,

32:43.300 --> 32:48.600
and I thought that it was different to copy strike a video than to strike an entire channel.

32:48.600 --> 32:52.100
What we see here is basically Poki saying she was ignorant,

32:52.100 --> 32:56.900
but wording it in a way as if that is a defence against the point that Fainted made,

32:56.900 --> 33:00.200
rather than just saying that as a multi-million subscriber channel,

33:00.200 --> 33:03.200
she probably shouldn't have been that ignorant in the first place,

33:03.200 --> 33:05.500
which is the point that a lot of people were making.

33:05.500 --> 33:08.200
And I'm not sure she's entirely aware she's doing it,

33:08.200 --> 33:11.700
a lot of processes in our reasoning are rather subconscious,

33:11.700 --> 33:16.100
but this sort of technique will always rub people the wrong way because of how it appears.

33:16.100 --> 33:17.700
But you see the point I'm making here.

33:17.700 --> 33:21.500
On one hand, you have Fainted, who in spite of the possible flaws of argumentation,

33:21.500 --> 33:25.800
has resented points in an articulate, systematic, and firm way,

33:25.800 --> 33:29.500
and on the other, you have Pokimane, who, whether there are points there or not,

33:29.500 --> 33:34.400
fall through because she can't seem to compartmentalise criticism into specifics,

33:34.400 --> 33:37.200
and ends up just spray-firing her defences.

33:37.200 --> 33:39.800
And honestly, the stream highlights that difference.

33:39.800 --> 33:44.000
When you put these two people against each other, the contrast is so vast,

33:44.000 --> 33:46.500
and this is the power of critical commentary.

33:46.500 --> 33:50.300
When you've done this for a while, it just puts you in a different league.

33:50.300 --> 33:55.000
A majority of the reason that Pokimane was called out, on top of the copyright strike,

33:55.000 --> 33:58.900
was her hypocrisy, and to bring it back to my first point of the video,

33:58.900 --> 34:03.500
I'm sure many of you guys won't be surprised to find out that it's fairly easy to point out

34:03.500 --> 34:05.200
hypocrisy in many of the Twitch streamers.

34:05.200 --> 34:10.000
Pretty much anyone who doesn't spend an hour a day evaluating their morality.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.900
It doesn't mean they're bad people, it just means they're not always thinking about it,

34:13.900 --> 34:17.000
and it's just a case of when they're put into that rotation.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.400
Many people from other genres just don't think about it, and we commentators do.

34:21.400 --> 34:25.500
And I don't think that's a bad thing, there's nothing wrong with pushing for consistency,

34:25.500 --> 34:28.700
but it is a difference, and one that has to be accepted.

34:28.700 --> 34:34.200
And I don't dislike Pokimane, because maybe people like Jake Paul and RiceGum have done terrible stuff,

34:34.200 --> 34:38.800
and they barely address it at all, and Pokimane tried to come forward and try to hit it,

34:38.800 --> 34:44.100
and she was just out of her depth in trying to retrospectively explain a morality

34:44.100 --> 34:47.900
that she knows she probably didn't think too much about at the time.

34:47.900 --> 34:51.700
But at the same time, in her head, she feels that she's a good person, and I understand that.

34:51.700 --> 34:54.700
But unfortunately, that's just the way the cookie crumbles.

34:54.700 --> 34:58.800
You see, you can't justify what you already deem unjustifiable,

34:58.800 --> 35:02.200
and you can't defend what you've already deemed to be indefensible,

35:02.200 --> 35:06.300
and you can't rationalize what you've deemed to be irrational.

35:06.300 --> 35:09.300
So to finish, responding to commentators is risky business.

35:09.300 --> 35:11.900
The reason I don't do these videos on people like RiceGum

35:11.900 --> 35:14.900
is because they don't care about their reputation when they respond.

35:14.900 --> 35:17.700
Pokimane clearly does. So I'll leave these points.

35:17.700 --> 35:22.000
Make sure your responses are tight, make sure people know exactly what points you're addressing,

35:22.000 --> 35:27.000
make sure you use evidence very clearly, make sure you work out the concessions that they make,

35:27.000 --> 35:31.200
and points that you might agree on, such as the point that Dav Sev is an annoying twat,

35:31.200 --> 35:36.400
and then work out how you can use those agreements or premises to bring that person around

35:36.400 --> 35:41.200
to your in-the-moment perspective, even if complete agreement is not quite possible.

35:41.200 --> 35:44.400
That is the summary of wisdom that I can leave you with today,

35:44.400 --> 35:48.200
and I hope you can take something away from it if you are indeed watching.

35:49.200 --> 35:52.000
So yeah, that was the video, once again.

35:52.000 --> 35:56.200
Very, very impressive. Thank you, guys, for the support of recent.

35:56.200 --> 35:59.000
I would love to hear your comments on the situation below,

35:59.000 --> 36:03.800
because it was quite an interesting one, definitely one of the more split situations,

36:03.800 --> 36:08.400
where a lot of it just came down to how you speak, and I love those situations,

36:08.400 --> 36:14.800
because it's really interesting how people's perspectives are actually much more shaped sometimes

36:15.000 --> 36:18.800
by how someone presents their point, rather than what points they have.

36:18.800 --> 36:21.000
And so, I love investigating these.

36:21.000 --> 36:25.200
I wanna give a big shout-out to my editors who've done another fabulous job.

36:25.200 --> 36:28.800
Please go and check them out. I'll leave their links in the pinned comment.

36:28.800 --> 36:33.200
Big shout-out to Patreons too, all of you lovely lads and lasses,

36:33.200 --> 36:39.200
and everyone, everyone who donates much appreciated, really does make a difference.

36:39.200 --> 36:43.400
Big shout-out to Connor, who is my $50 Patreon.

36:43.400 --> 36:47.600
I have to give a shout-out to some Hullabaloo, another great $50 Patreon.

36:47.600 --> 36:50.000
Thank you so much, lots of love.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.600
I have to give a shout-out to Ryan, who is a $100 Patreon.

36:53.600 --> 36:55.800
I mean, respect the hustle, man.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.400
And Brandon, who is a $100 Patreon.

36:58.400 --> 37:01.400
Truly, I am truly blessed by all of you.

37:01.400 --> 37:03.800
I don't have too much else to say.

37:03.800 --> 37:08.600
If you want to message me, if you wanna speak with me, my Twitter DMs are open.

37:08.600 --> 37:11.600
Facebook too, Discord as well.

37:11.800 --> 37:15.200
Links will be in the description, pinned comment. Go and check them out.

37:15.200 --> 37:18.000
Don't really have too much else to say, so I hope you guys are having a great day,

37:18.000 --> 37:19.600
and I hope this made it a bit better.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.600
Take care, guys. Love you lot.

37:41.600 --> 37:43.600
Thanks for watching!
