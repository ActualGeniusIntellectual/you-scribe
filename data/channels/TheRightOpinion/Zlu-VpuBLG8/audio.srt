00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,860
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,860
too much free time.

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,020
And boy, have I been waiting a long time to do this video, and in a way, I could have

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,700
done it sooner, but there's just a timeless appeal of the discourse to me.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,480
I had bigger fish to fry at the time, so I left it in the lake, but now The Right Opinion

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,780
has his rod out.

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,240
Wait, that sounded much better in my head.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,100
But anyhow, before we go off on a tangent about The Right Opinion's rod, this man is

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,100
Michael McCrudden.

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,780
Michael McCrudden is a person.

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,760
I use person to the most broad effect, but he does still classify in my books as a human

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,760
being, just about.

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,900
He has been the topic of hot controversy in the last few months.

14
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,940
You see, Michael McCrudden owns his channel, in which he talks about celebrities before

15
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,940
they were famous, after they were famous, their rich life, a few other side series,

16
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,220
and most notoriously, before they were gone.

17
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,480
We'll be using the last one to talk about a lot of questions that have been flaring

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,580
up amongst the community, because McCrudden has probably been the best example of what

19
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,780
happens when people become slightly too opportunistic and slip into the public eye.

20
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,780
But why?

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,260
Well, when someone passes away, many think it's important to be respectful of the deceased

22
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,700
and give them and their family some space during the times of mourning.

23
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,180
However, McCrudden's philosophy has come to show that he might not be so concerned

24
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,180
with that.

25
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,500
Now, I've always been aware, vaguely, of McCrudden's channel, but more as an onlooker

26
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,500
rather than a commentator.

27
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,780
He's a significant size, in spite of the incredibly inconsistent view counts.

28
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,700
Rather than the regular allegations that not all of his facts are completely accurate,

29
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,940
the first taste of controversy that he gave me was when my friend James Merritt decided

30
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,540
to release a video criticising him.

31
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,140
I definitely urge you to check out James' content, it's very good, and that particular

32
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,100
video is one that we will definitely revisit in a bit.

33
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,420
It definitely levels some very legitimate criticisms.

34
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,300
I considered covering it back then, but it wasn't exactly my cup of tea.

35
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,820
However, over the last couple months, it is definitely brewed, and now the right opinion

36
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,180
is ready to serve up some piping hot Earl Grey.

37
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,180
Delicious.

38
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,580
McCrudden, on the other hand, is finding himself in a metaphorical sort of hot water.

39
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,280
After the sudden death of extremely popular and equally controversial rapper XXXTentacion,

40
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,540
he was criticised for making not one, not two, but three videos in quick succession,

41
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,380
all capitalising on this event.

42
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,660
They were shameless to say the least.

43
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,280
No matter what genre he stepped into or what he was talking about, everyone knew there

44
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:21,100
was a real unique artist here, a true talent, one of a kind.

45
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,880
These led to a lot of outrage and criticism, which subsequently led to a lot of videos,

46
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,120
and then consequently led to a lot of people asking if these videos were hypocritical on

47
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,460
how they behaved, and if McCrudden was even in the wrong at all.

48
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,660
People were tripping over themselves in an attempt to have the moral high ground.

49
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,360
A similar situation occurred earlier this year with Logan Paul, many asserted that those

50
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,020
who made videos on his little voyage were no better than him, particularly those who

51
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,380
then decided to monetise and sponsor those videos.

52
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,340
And when there are slight details like the ones in question, it doesn't necessarily

53
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,500
make you a bad person because you may not be thinking about it.

54
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,940
However, I am the right opinion, the blessed messiah for all your argumentation, and I've

55
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,420
been mulling over this for a while, and I've proposed myself to be the one to lay out some

56
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,020
conditions that may affect whether a situation could be considered distasteful and to help

57
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,540
you have a clearer grip on your opinion.

58
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,520
Allow me to clarify that in this video I will mostly be avoiding pushing for one position.

59
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,800
If you're here for the more opinionated content, don't worry, there's plenty of that to come

60
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
in the future.

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,440
This is a bit more of an analytical piece, I will state my opinion at the end after applying

62
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,280
all the conditions that I deem relevant, but the thing is there are many reasoned arguments

63
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,540
that can be made for all points of view in this instance, but hopefully by the end we'll

64
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,000
be able to distinguish the I'm Alex's from the Michael McCrudden's, if you know what

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I mean.

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,980
You might come out thinking neither of them were acceptable, you might come out thinking

67
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,440
both of them were acceptable, but let's clear the air and understand why we think

68
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,440
are acceptable.

69
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,440
Alright?

70
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,440
Great.

71
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,080
Can't think of anything else to say so, that was a nice short dicey intro, without further

72
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,400
ado, let's get right into it.

73
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,800
Today I will be talking about XXXTentacion in large volumes.

74
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,680
It makes sense, in a way, it is the inflammatory source of the video.

75
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,500
Without this Michael McCrudden saga, this probably wouldn't exist, however most people

76
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,720
will not be attacking me for mentioning it, monetising it, in the same way that people

77
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,880
attack McCrudden.

78
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,000
What changes the situation?

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Context.

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,800
It's a simple answer, but it's easy to forget when people are riled up about topics.

81
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,560
There are many elements of context, and ones that we should be breaking down very concisely.

82
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,520
We're going to use multiple examples, I'll be using McCrudden's, probably James Merritt's,

83
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,380
and also probably I'm Alex's, because I know this video as well, and I understand

84
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,920
what was being said in them, and these are all interesting cases which can yield some

85
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,100
strong debate.

86
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,400
So let's break it down, because McCrudden is not a commentator.

87
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,640
And in the McCrudden videos, XXXTentacion's death was a primary subject.

88
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:51,000
It was the key clincher for a lot of viewers, he advertised them as videos on the topic,

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,840
and had them central to the videos at hand.

90
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,140
Generally I find the sensitive topics as a commentator either come across as primary

91
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,440
or secondary subjects, obviously the primary being what I've just described, the one

92
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,060
where you make it the central point, however videos like this one that you're watching

93
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,540
right now may include it as a supplement.

94
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,940
Generally I think most of the scrutiny focuses around videos that have it as their primary

95
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,300
topic, however a very interesting debate around YouTube is obviously the unique culture within

96
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,500
that prevails secondary topics.

97
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
Clickbait culture.

98
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,180
The fate of a 10 minute video could hinge on a brief glance of a thumbnail and title,

99
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,820
and therefore a title can actually be more important than the topic of a video in determining

100
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,100
whether an action is disrespectful or not, because it's the views that will bring

101
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,640
you any subsequent traction and ad revenue.

102
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:40,000
So although in many cases the topic of the content may define how someone judges it,

103
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,440
it's more how you gain the attention that would dictate whether it's more or less

104
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,440
susceptible.

105
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,380
So in YouTube's position you might have the topic as a secondary on the video but

106
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,300
still be using their depth to a significant effect.

107
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,320
This is why some people raised the issue with I Am Alex's video, the idea that although

108
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,060
his video was more focusing on others and their reaction, his title and thumbnail referenced

109
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,020
XXXTentacion much more heavily than the subjects of his actual video, and therefore he drew

110
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:10,940
people in because he prioritised XXXTentacion's death as the subject in his thumbnail and

111
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,220
title, but I can understand why people accused him of hypocrisy despite the fact that his

112
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,640
video was fairly strong in all of its points.

113
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,840
And obviously equally important is what you say when you have the attention, if it's

114
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,220
a secondary topic it's much more likely that you've integrated it with a greater

115
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,980
narrative regardless, so there's not much to debate in that instance, however in your

116
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,620
primary topic ask yourself, why are you doing the video, what are you going to bring to

117
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,620
the topic.

118
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,180
With someone like Michael McCrudden, although the topic is consistent to his channel, he

119
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,940
clearly lacks a knowledge in the topic whilst still acting like he was somewhat familiar

120
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,740
with the individual in question.

121
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,940
There is nothing in his videos apart from surface level observations, nothing to develop

122
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,500
on his character, and nothing anyone could really not find elsewhere, and he can't

123
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,820
even pronounce the school's name despite having an image of it on screen, it's Margate.

124
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:20,600
Which led to him getting expelled from Margaret Middle School.

125
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,740
When speaking about him, I would describe him or put him in the same box as Tupac, Elvis

126
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:30,100
and Kurt Cobain, but it was clearly an appeal to XXXTentacion fans rather than a genuine

127
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,100
statement.

128
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:39,680
He always encourages people to leave their condolences in the comments below, and once

129
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,380
again to the unassuming fan, they probably wouldn't think twice about that, but everyone

130
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,480
knows that it aids the algorithms when a commenter engages.

131
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,780
He loves taking advantage of the fans, he does the cheapest job possible, and that's

132
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,460
what annoys many people, justifiably so.

133
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,080
And make no mistake, McCrudden is an actor.

134
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:04,660
He ended up on YouTube from an advert on Craigslist, it's clear he never had an intimate relationship

135
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,380
with the platform, and it's not like he's lacking charisma necessarily, it's just

136
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,940
clear that he's on autopilot.

137
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,380
And when you're talking about someone's death, it seems somewhat important that you

138
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,500
have a passion for the subject, especially when covering it.

139
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,860
Although the Before They Were Dead series seems congruent with McCrudden's channel,

140
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,380
it's hard to see it as a passion for what he talks about.

141
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,460
He applies principles of morality with a conviction, he expands on base information, whereas McCrudden

142
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:31,720
touches base with a plethora of points but never applies them, so he seems about as personally

143
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,380
invested as someone reading off a teleprompter.

144
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,180
This is a case of every one of his videos, but when applied to a situation that many

145
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,980
would describe as fairly sensitive, it makes it even more tasteless, which is another thing

146
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,040
we should break down, the sensitivity of a situation.

147
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,420
I think people felt defensive over the fact that the situation involving X was one that

148
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,660
ended rather abruptly and violently, there were still a lot of unanswered questions,

149
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,220
and here McCrudden was pumping out those videos.

150
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,620
A very interesting truth I've noticed was that people appear to be more defensive when

151
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,000
the dead person was young or was a victim of tragic circumstances, I noticed a lot of

152
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,260
people having banter about Stephen Hawking upon his death, however it seemed much more

153
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,360
taboo when someone like X died.

154
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,020
I think many people have the stern don't take advantage of a tragedy principle, don't

155
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,980
capitalise on someone else's suffering.

156
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,280
Suffering here is much stronger when there is an abject factor changing these circumstances,

157
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,220
his life has not been brought to a tender close, it's been cut short, and here's

158
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,740
McCrudden milking it until the cows come home.

159
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,860
Speaking of capitalisation, that's another important asset to consider, how much is a

160
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,860
person gaining from talking about this person's death?

161
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,440
Why do many people refuse to monetise a video on such topics?

162
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,860
Because they don't want to be seen as taking advantage of their death or any other catastrophes

163
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,860
at that.

164
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:51,420
McCrudden, once again, is not concerned with that and will slap multiple ads and even a

165
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,020
cheeky sponsorship deal fully integrated with the topic.

166
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:38,400
On top of that, even with the very short time frame since X's death in which these

167
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,660
videos were made, McCrudden failed to bring any new attention necessary to these situations

168
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,260
or any new outlook.

169
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,260
He just rode on the coattails himself, nothing that would add depth to the context that he

170
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,260
provides.

171
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,400
Let's apply it to what we've just discussed and as a fair follow on, let's ask why does

172
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,980
McCrudden cause all the outrage?

173
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,380
Well when it comes to the most shameless exploitative content on a situation, it's quite easy

174
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,740
to see why McCrudden is viewed as one of the worst on the spectrum.

175
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:10,540
Of the conditions listed, he shows very little core interest on a topic, adds minimal transformative

176
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:15,800
value, completely capitalises on the popularity without bringing any insight himself and milks

177
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,980
it until it's dead, and milks it after it's dead too, visibly.

178
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,880
Ironically, this makes him one of the most morally consistent people on the platform

179
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,100
because it's easy to keep a moral code when you barely have one, therefore he's always

180
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,900
somewhat above any criticism because the debate over receptability of topics is not one that

181
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,260
can necessarily be decided by fact, it is just a simple case of where you draw the line

182
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,260
personally.

183
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,000
Personally, it's hard to base such topics on any foundation of absolute truth, so this

184
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,520
leads to people saying, well he can do what he wants, and others going, well that doesn't

185
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,520
make it right.

186
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,840
With that said, I do not even believe McCrudden is the worst offender for all the criticism

187
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,720
that can be brought about him, an individual like ImJayStation is incrementally worse as

188
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,960
he is manipulating the circumstances around the death and using agreed fans and their

189
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,400
hope that he might have something else to say after his passing, that is fairly disgusting,

190
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,740
but people identify that much more easily, anything that involves active deception for

191
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,040
emotional manipulation in my opinion is fairly pathetic, particularly when you're claiming

192
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,540
to speak on behalf of the deceased individual, the subject matter only makes it worse.

193
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,780
I think the morality is extremely clear on such an issue.

194
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:27,820
Yeet yeet, let's hit 100k likes for xxxtentacion lads, we all know it's what he would have

195
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,820
wanted.

196
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:34,060
He also loved his own comment, if that isn't a sign of degeneracy, I do not know what is.

197
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,300
Now the problem comes with commentary on the issue of how you avoid being a hypocrite

198
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,800
when you're calling someone out, and to a degree, can you?

199
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,480
The problem when discussing issues like morality is that it's a constant trap to avoid yourself

200
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,080
being caught out, and it often leads to allegations of the hypocrisy that we've just said and

201
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,080
so on.

202
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,080
Why is this?

203
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,320
Mainly because people place different emphasis on the assets that we've outlined today,

204
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,620
some would argue that what you say in a video is irrelevant compared with how you advertise

205
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,240
or what you gain off it, others would say it's just as comparable, and in fact sometimes

206
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,260
people will hate you more than the person you're criticizing, particularly as commentators

207
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,120
choose to take the moral high ground.

208
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,600
People like McCrudden never claim to be moral, and without commentary they'd never be criticized.

209
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,560
As you've probably seen, McCrudden's ratios are still pretty fine, in spite of the obvious

210
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:34,600
exploitation.

211
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,580
Another important question is what makes this sort of exploitation any worse than the reporting

212
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,580
in the media?

213
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,340
After all, all the news sites were rushing to report it and typically dramatize it, and

214
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,660
they all run ads on it too.

215
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,980
It's a fair question, and one that we have to reapply in a way.

216
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,320
Usually we accept journalism sites under the premise that they report the news, so

217
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,280
it's fairly ordinary that they would report this, and have it monetized too.

218
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,240
McCrudden might say, well if they can do it, why can't I?

219
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,200
And I don't think anyone really has a problem with reporting the death of XXXTentacion,

220
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,200
if that's what is expected, however people do have a greater problem with media culture

221
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,480
in the race to the bottom that they conduct.

222
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,800
The only reason why we don't make videos on the media every time a shitty story is published

223
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,680
is because we'd be making videos every fucking day.

224
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,340
Mainstream media is criticised for putting clicks before actual stories, commentators

225
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,800
are just trying to keep YouTube under the pulse to avoid falling down the same road.

226
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,700
Just because it's expected doesn't mean it's accepted.

227
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,700
We have a different moral code on YouTube, and one that I will definitely discuss later.

228
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,140
The other point of the news is that in spite of my numerous criticisms of them, they do

229
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,320
assist distribution of information to new audiences.

230
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,420
Many people from certain backgrounds may not be aware of the rapper known as XXXTentacion,

231
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,340
whereas I highly doubt many of the YouTube demographic found that McCrudden was breaking

232
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,060
any news, particularly by the third time.

233
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,420
So let's roleplay, you're an upcoming YouTuber, and you want to call all these bellends out

234
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,140
because you don't think it's justified that grave robbers like McCrudden should be

235
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,440
making money off other people's grief.

236
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,300
That is fair enough, it's not a universal sentiment, but there's a strong case to

237
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,300
be made.

238
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,660
Let's ask a question, how do you call these people out while making sure you're not

239
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,120
indulging in the same practices?

240
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,520
Even in such a ravenous genre like commentary, most of your audience will not notice.

241
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:22,400
But if you're not careful, it may come back to bite you when another more pedantic commentator

242
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,100
picks it up and hones in on you, because when you actually make it, the knives are never

243
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,480
far from your throat.

244
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,840
So let's bring back the point about secondary topics.

245
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,920
Given the way it's delivered, commentary tends to make most of these subjects secondary.

246
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,720
We normally talk about other people using these particular topics, therefore it's

247
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,200
important to make the individual in question the main target, rather than the topic they're

248
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,460
talking about, particularly if you want to advertise it as that.

249
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,600
I think that the risk you run with advertising it as the death topic is that if you then

250
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,020
monetize and sponsor the video, it can make you very susceptible to being accused of acting

251
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,020
no better.

252
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:17,540
You're profiting off advertising on a video that you present about someone's demise,

253
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,700
regardless of the content of the video.

254
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,620
If you're not profiting off the video, then many would argue subscriber gains and views

255
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:29,160
At that point, it's important to look on how much the video may be appealing to the

256
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,380
algorithms, dishonestly at least.

257
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:36,220
If we scoot over to ImAllexx's video, bar the satire tag, which people are in my opinion

258
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:41,360
wrongfully correlating with algorithm side-stepping mechanisms, the tags are strictly relevant.

259
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,960
Using slightly irrelevant tags for views is not looked on badly, most of the community

260
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,580
does it, but when dealing with certain topics, it might be best to hold off.

261
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,180
Many people would argue that those topics shouldn't be about views, even if you have

262
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,180
a point to make.

263
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,500
Now to point to a video that does this would be to point to James Merrick's video on

264
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
Michael McCrudden.

265
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,940
As it's advertised, it's prioritizing the primary topic, it addresses exactly why

266
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:06,420
his depiction is an exceptional example, and does not milk the secondary topic nor seeks

267
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,380
to exploit any audience grief.

268
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,160
However, this does lead to some more deeper, more moral conundrums, and it's amazing

269
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,740
what a simple topic like this can lend.

270
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,820
Let's go there now.

271
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,820
Just now, I mentioned that if you're a commentator, that to avoid being hammered as a hypocrite,

272
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:27,460
you need to be somewhat sensitive with advertising, however there is another argument that addresses

273
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,260
this point from a different perspective.

274
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,920
And this is the means end point, and it's necessary that I present these arguments because

275
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,640
everyone has these core feelings, and I know some people watching right now may have the

276
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,700
nagging feeling that there is a case for being a bit dirty on the promotion of a well-intentioned

277
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,500
video, even if it does risk running the point of hypocrisy.

278
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,980
The reason that some people feel this way is because we look at people like McCrudden

279
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,560
doing all these scummy actions to gain traction, and we want people to see our videos calling

280
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:57,000
them out, and we know that if they're using underhanded tactics to own the algorithm,

281
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
we want people to see our videos on them, and to make sure they're not taking advantage

282
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,660
of that audience, we want to help make people aware.

283
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,600
It becomes a question of the greater good, and it's a legitimate point, and one that

284
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,960
must be considered.

285
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,560
In those instances, I think it is partly about the point you're making, and if you're going

286
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,680
to be a bit more clickbait with your topics at the end of the day, you're never going

287
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:22,080
to please everyone, however if you focus on the primary topic enough on an individual

288
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,600
like McCrudden, and you have a strong point to make while keeping it consistent with the

289
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,440
tone of the channel, then you can use that secondary topic.

290
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,120
I will make this video slightly attractive to the human eye, and that's mainly because

291
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:38,040
it will be advertised as a piece about McCrudden, and the point about XXXTentacion comes secondary.

292
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,160
You shouldn't be shy about a piece if your inclusion of the topic is somewhat natural

293
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,640
and necessary, and I'm trying to think of the most basic way to break this down for

294
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,640
you lads.

295
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,340
This is something that is actually quite a common discussion in the political sphere

296
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,500
of YouTube, particularly the more controversial sex of the wings.

297
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,460
At what point is it necessary to do something immoral to prevent a perceived greater evil?

298
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:02,300
The issue is that, applied here, your normal audience may not view McCrudden as a greater

299
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,740
evil when they are first introduced to your video, and therefore jumping in with perhaps

300
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,520
questionable actions, even if we want to think that what we're doing is something better,

301
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,420
in a way convincing people that you're an authority on these things means behaving in

302
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,540
a way that will reflect said principles, particularly on first impressions.

303
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,460
With that said, if we want to become slightly Machiavellian in this bitch, most people probably

304
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,520
won't notice subtle appeals to the algorithm, although you'll probably be criticised even

305
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,000
more if you're caught out.

306
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,940
So my advice is, if you do it, you do it at your own risk.

307
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,900
It's not necessarily a bad thing to make sure people are seeing you calling McCrudden out,

308
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,880
but at the same time, you will risk undermining your own credibility.

309
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,100
Logic and Argumentation As commentators, when we make a video, we

310
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,760
choose the point to make.

311
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,340
This is where we select the thesis.

312
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,900
So we might select the thesis, Michael McCrudden is a shitty human being, which is a fairly

313
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,500
monetisable topic on concept, however when attempting to prove that argument, you might

314
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,520
come across certain topics that are more sensitive, however to use those topics doesn't necessarily

315
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,520
undermine the truth of your point, it just means that you may need to refer to them.

316
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,260
If you're doing a channel where you constantly call people out for taking advantage of others,

317
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,880
then you might feel you deserve a fair bit of dollar for it, I think it's just important

318
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,540
in those instances to make sure you're being honest with what you're advertising.

319
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,760
This however leads us to another question.

320
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,360
When we say people shouldn't be exploiting sensitive situations, what do we want to be

321
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,360
the result of it?

322
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,480
There's a really interesting video made by Willimaxshow, it's quite a controversial piece

323
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,500
and I've even argued about it with him.

324
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,320
However in the video, he attacks PewDiePie and H3 for criticising Logan Paul's treatment

325
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,300
of the Japanese culture in the run up to the incident, he asserted that what they did was

326
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,740
rather hypocritical given their history, however a greater point that I took is that we must

327
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:44,120
be careful with how we approach such topics so that we as commentators are not caught

328
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,120
in the crossfire.

329
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,100
As mentioned earlier, YouTube has a very different culture to media, it's one that I'm pretty

330
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,100
proud of to be honest.

331
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,680
We tend to feel a lot more inclined to look at a person's moral fabric rather than the

332
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,220
reactionary attention of actions.

333
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,500
We must be careful to clarify about what we are criticising people for, and we must hold

334
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,580
on to a very concise narrative, and look at the person and look at the action and create

335
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:08,920
a context and don't just leave it to the audience, and most importantly in this case,

336
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,920
the media.

337
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,940
As a collective, we should be careful with what we condemn, everything I've discussed

338
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,920
today is relevant, because if we go around pointing fingers at people for doing certain

339
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,680
things on vague terms, we might cause the rules to be imposed on ourselves that equally

340
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,660
fail to distinguish the context that we didn't do when we made those videos.

341
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,440
When people call others hypocrites, it's not because they're necessarily trying to undermine

342
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,120
us, it may just be that we haven't argued or presented or even advertised our points

343
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,260
properly, particularly when you consider the sort of grudge the mainstream media do have

344
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,400
against the platform.

345
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,020
Many of us do think it's fair to distinguish between the chaotic good YouTubers like iDubbbz

346
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,380
and the sort of creed that McCrudden represents.

347
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,820
We also need to think about what we expect in response to these actions.

348
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:54,340
Many people justifiably wanted action taken against Logan Paul for his little forest excursion,

349
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,340
but should we really lump his preceding actions onto that?

350
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,540
Would we really want for the other situations to necessarily be punished?

351
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,600
What do we want for people like McCrudden?

352
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,600
Probably not the same.

353
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,340
Mostly, I think it's just really important to put forward a compelling case and allow

354
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,400
the audience to deduce why maybe they shouldn't be supporting these YouTubers.

355
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,360
We should try and convince them that McCrudden is not worth watching rather than have the

356
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,340
greater website intervene because the algorithms that they will run are general.

357
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,820
They don't distinguish the levels of context that I've discussed today.

358
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,880
If they did, that would be fantastic, but they won't.

359
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,200
We all know that would be wishful thinking.

360
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,240
Displaying morality on this platform is a lot more complex than it might seem on the

361
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,240
surface.

362
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,280
Dealing with sensitive topics, calling out others who exploit them, while not being labelled

363
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,720
hypocrite, and knowing what is worth calling out and how to avoid jeopardising our own

364
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,900
content through it.

365
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:46,180
It's quite a spiderweb in which it is easy to be caught in, but it's always important

366
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,620
to retain that control.

367
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,340
However, with some thought, you can hopefully clear out the bearings on your moral compass

368
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,260
and be able to make those strong statements, like the one I'm about to make.

369
00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:00,140
Michael McCrudden is a scummy human being and he capitalises on the suffering of other

370
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,140
people.

371
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,640
Judging from what we've observed, his motivations are anything but pure.

372
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,140
For example, the Lil Peep video that we discussed earlier, briefly made by James Merrick, pointed

373
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,660
out how he literally copied and pasted his content from a month before.

374
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,540
There's not someone who cares about these people who have died tragically.

375
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:20,980
You know, XXXTentacion, very controversial bloke, without a doubt, but I would say, there

376
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,440
are many people, even people I know, who clearly had their lives affected by him, even though

377
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,740
I don't completely get it.

378
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,780
And therefore, for McCrudden to step in, to act like he had some sort of connection with

379
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,180
him, to act like he had something to bring.

380
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,180
Three times over.

381
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,120
He's not a nice bloke.

382
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,240
Anyhow, those are my thoughts on morality, Michael McCrudden, and so much more.

383
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,720
I would love to hear what you think about it, because it is a very complex topic and

384
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,120
I know that we're not completely dealing with all the intricacies right here, right now.

385
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,180
However, hopefully it does stimulate some sort of discussion that we can take forward.

386
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:56,400
Hopefully it'll inspire people to draw a much clearer line on how they feel about these

387
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,400
topics.

388
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
Let me know down below.

389
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,920
I'd also like to thank my editors who once again have done a fantastic job, I'll leave

390
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,660
all their links in the pinned comment most likely.

391
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:08,900
Definitely check them out, I can't give them enough credit, they just do a great job every

392
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,540
single time.

393
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:15,380
Not too much else to say, if you want to reach me on Twitter, at The Right Pinion, Facebook,

394
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:20,260
Discord, links below, you can find me all there, I'm an accessible person and I do my

395
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,260
best to be.

396
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:25,380
However, until we reach that bridge, I'm The Right Pinion, and I'll see you in the next

397
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:25,880
one.

398
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,920
Thanks for watching, I'll see you in the next one.
