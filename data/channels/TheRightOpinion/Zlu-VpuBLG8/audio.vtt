00:00.000 --> 00:08.860
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:08.860 --> 00:09.860
too much free time.

00:09.860 --> 00:13.020
And boy, have I been waiting a long time to do this video, and in a way, I could have

00:13.020 --> 00:16.700
done it sooner, but there's just a timeless appeal of the discourse to me.

00:16.700 --> 00:20.480
I had bigger fish to fry at the time, so I left it in the lake, but now The Right Opinion

00:20.480 --> 00:21.780
has his rod out.

00:21.780 --> 00:24.240
Wait, that sounded much better in my head.

00:24.240 --> 00:28.100
But anyhow, before we go off on a tangent about The Right Opinion's rod, this man is

00:28.100 --> 00:29.100
Michael McCrudden.

00:29.100 --> 00:30.780
Michael McCrudden is a person.

00:30.780 --> 00:35.760
I use person to the most broad effect, but he does still classify in my books as a human

00:35.760 --> 00:36.760
being, just about.

00:36.760 --> 00:39.900
He has been the topic of hot controversy in the last few months.

00:39.900 --> 00:43.940
You see, Michael McCrudden owns his channel, in which he talks about celebrities before

00:43.940 --> 00:47.940
they were famous, after they were famous, their rich life, a few other side series,

00:47.940 --> 00:50.220
and most notoriously, before they were gone.

00:50.220 --> 00:53.480
We'll be using the last one to talk about a lot of questions that have been flaring

00:53.480 --> 00:57.580
up amongst the community, because McCrudden has probably been the best example of what

00:57.580 --> 01:01.780
happens when people become slightly too opportunistic and slip into the public eye.

01:01.780 --> 01:02.780
But why?

01:02.780 --> 01:07.260
Well, when someone passes away, many think it's important to be respectful of the deceased

01:07.260 --> 01:10.700
and give them and their family some space during the times of mourning.

01:10.700 --> 01:14.180
However, McCrudden's philosophy has come to show that he might not be so concerned

01:14.180 --> 01:15.180
with that.

01:15.180 --> 01:18.500
Now, I've always been aware, vaguely, of McCrudden's channel, but more as an onlooker

01:18.500 --> 01:19.500
rather than a commentator.

01:19.500 --> 01:23.780
He's a significant size, in spite of the incredibly inconsistent view counts.

01:23.780 --> 01:27.700
Rather than the regular allegations that not all of his facts are completely accurate,

01:27.700 --> 01:30.940
the first taste of controversy that he gave me was when my friend James Merritt decided

01:30.940 --> 01:32.540
to release a video criticising him.

01:32.540 --> 01:36.140
I definitely urge you to check out James' content, it's very good, and that particular

01:36.140 --> 01:39.100
video is one that we will definitely revisit in a bit.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.420
It definitely levels some very legitimate criticisms.

01:41.420 --> 01:45.300
I considered covering it back then, but it wasn't exactly my cup of tea.

01:45.300 --> 01:48.820
However, over the last couple months, it is definitely brewed, and now the right opinion

01:48.820 --> 01:52.180
is ready to serve up some piping hot Earl Grey.

01:52.180 --> 01:53.180
Delicious.

01:53.180 --> 01:57.580
McCrudden, on the other hand, is finding himself in a metaphorical sort of hot water.

01:57.580 --> 02:02.280
After the sudden death of extremely popular and equally controversial rapper XXXTentacion,

02:02.280 --> 02:06.540
he was criticised for making not one, not two, but three videos in quick succession,

02:06.540 --> 02:08.380
all capitalising on this event.

02:08.380 --> 02:10.660
They were shameless to say the least.

02:10.660 --> 02:14.280
No matter what genre he stepped into or what he was talking about, everyone knew there

02:14.280 --> 02:21.100
was a real unique artist here, a true talent, one of a kind.

02:21.100 --> 02:24.880
These led to a lot of outrage and criticism, which subsequently led to a lot of videos,

02:24.880 --> 02:28.120
and then consequently led to a lot of people asking if these videos were hypocritical on

02:28.120 --> 02:31.460
how they behaved, and if McCrudden was even in the wrong at all.

02:31.460 --> 02:34.660
People were tripping over themselves in an attempt to have the moral high ground.

02:34.660 --> 02:38.360
A similar situation occurred earlier this year with Logan Paul, many asserted that those

02:38.360 --> 02:42.020
who made videos on his little voyage were no better than him, particularly those who

02:42.020 --> 02:44.380
then decided to monetise and sponsor those videos.

02:44.380 --> 02:48.340
And when there are slight details like the ones in question, it doesn't necessarily

02:48.340 --> 02:51.500
make you a bad person because you may not be thinking about it.

02:51.500 --> 02:55.940
However, I am the right opinion, the blessed messiah for all your argumentation, and I've

02:55.940 --> 02:59.420
been mulling over this for a while, and I've proposed myself to be the one to lay out some

02:59.420 --> 03:04.020
conditions that may affect whether a situation could be considered distasteful and to help

03:04.020 --> 03:06.540
you have a clearer grip on your opinion.

03:06.540 --> 03:11.520
Allow me to clarify that in this video I will mostly be avoiding pushing for one position.

03:11.520 --> 03:15.800
If you're here for the more opinionated content, don't worry, there's plenty of that to come

03:15.800 --> 03:16.800
in the future.

03:16.800 --> 03:21.440
This is a bit more of an analytical piece, I will state my opinion at the end after applying

03:21.440 --> 03:25.280
all the conditions that I deem relevant, but the thing is there are many reasoned arguments

03:25.280 --> 03:28.540
that can be made for all points of view in this instance, but hopefully by the end we'll

03:28.540 --> 03:33.000
be able to distinguish the I'm Alex's from the Michael McCrudden's, if you know what

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
I mean.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.980
You might come out thinking neither of them were acceptable, you might come out thinking

03:36.980 --> 03:41.440
both of them were acceptable, but let's clear the air and understand why we think

03:41.440 --> 03:42.440
are acceptable.

03:42.440 --> 03:43.440
Alright?

03:43.440 --> 03:44.440
Great.

03:44.440 --> 03:48.080
Can't think of anything else to say so, that was a nice short dicey intro, without further

03:48.080 --> 03:50.400
ado, let's get right into it.

03:55.200 --> 03:59.800
Today I will be talking about XXXTentacion in large volumes.

03:59.800 --> 04:03.680
It makes sense, in a way, it is the inflammatory source of the video.

04:03.680 --> 04:07.500
Without this Michael McCrudden saga, this probably wouldn't exist, however most people

04:07.500 --> 04:11.720
will not be attacking me for mentioning it, monetising it, in the same way that people

04:11.720 --> 04:12.880
attack McCrudden.

04:12.880 --> 04:15.000
What changes the situation?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Context.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.800
It's a simple answer, but it's easy to forget when people are riled up about topics.

04:20.800 --> 04:24.560
There are many elements of context, and ones that we should be breaking down very concisely.

04:24.560 --> 04:29.520
We're going to use multiple examples, I'll be using McCrudden's, probably James Merritt's,

04:29.520 --> 04:33.380
and also probably I'm Alex's, because I know this video as well, and I understand

04:33.380 --> 04:36.920
what was being said in them, and these are all interesting cases which can yield some

04:36.920 --> 04:38.100
strong debate.

04:38.100 --> 04:41.400
So let's break it down, because McCrudden is not a commentator.

04:41.400 --> 04:45.640
And in the McCrudden videos, XXXTentacion's death was a primary subject.

04:45.640 --> 04:51.000
It was the key clincher for a lot of viewers, he advertised them as videos on the topic,

04:51.000 --> 04:53.840
and had them central to the videos at hand.

04:53.840 --> 04:58.140
Generally I find the sensitive topics as a commentator either come across as primary

04:58.140 --> 05:02.440
or secondary subjects, obviously the primary being what I've just described, the one

05:02.440 --> 05:06.060
where you make it the central point, however videos like this one that you're watching

05:06.060 --> 05:08.540
right now may include it as a supplement.

05:08.540 --> 05:12.940
Generally I think most of the scrutiny focuses around videos that have it as their primary

05:12.940 --> 05:17.300
topic, however a very interesting debate around YouTube is obviously the unique culture within

05:17.300 --> 05:19.500
that prevails secondary topics.

05:19.500 --> 05:20.500
Clickbait culture.

05:20.500 --> 05:25.180
The fate of a 10 minute video could hinge on a brief glance of a thumbnail and title,

05:25.180 --> 05:29.820
and therefore a title can actually be more important than the topic of a video in determining

05:29.820 --> 05:33.100
whether an action is disrespectful or not, because it's the views that will bring

05:33.100 --> 05:35.640
you any subsequent traction and ad revenue.

05:35.640 --> 05:40.000
So although in many cases the topic of the content may define how someone judges it,

05:40.000 --> 05:43.440
it's more how you gain the attention that would dictate whether it's more or less

05:43.440 --> 05:44.440
susceptible.

05:44.440 --> 05:48.380
So in YouTube's position you might have the topic as a secondary on the video but

05:48.380 --> 05:51.300
still be using their depth to a significant effect.

05:51.300 --> 05:55.320
This is why some people raised the issue with I Am Alex's video, the idea that although

05:55.320 --> 06:00.060
his video was more focusing on others and their reaction, his title and thumbnail referenced

06:00.060 --> 06:05.020
XXXTentacion much more heavily than the subjects of his actual video, and therefore he drew

06:05.060 --> 06:10.940
people in because he prioritised XXXTentacion's death as the subject in his thumbnail and

06:10.940 --> 06:15.220
title, but I can understand why people accused him of hypocrisy despite the fact that his

06:15.220 --> 06:18.640
video was fairly strong in all of its points.

06:18.640 --> 06:22.840
And obviously equally important is what you say when you have the attention, if it's

06:22.840 --> 06:26.220
a secondary topic it's much more likely that you've integrated it with a greater

06:26.220 --> 06:29.980
narrative regardless, so there's not much to debate in that instance, however in your

06:29.980 --> 06:34.620
primary topic ask yourself, why are you doing the video, what are you going to bring to

06:34.620 --> 06:35.620
the topic.

06:35.620 --> 06:39.180
With someone like Michael McCrudden, although the topic is consistent to his channel, he

06:39.180 --> 06:42.940
clearly lacks a knowledge in the topic whilst still acting like he was somewhat familiar

06:42.940 --> 06:44.740
with the individual in question.

06:44.740 --> 06:48.940
There is nothing in his videos apart from surface level observations, nothing to develop

06:48.940 --> 06:53.500
on his character, and nothing anyone could really not find elsewhere, and he can't

06:53.500 --> 06:58.820
even pronounce the school's name despite having an image of it on screen, it's Margate.

06:58.820 --> 07:20.600
Which led to him getting expelled from Margaret Middle School.

07:20.600 --> 07:24.740
When speaking about him, I would describe him or put him in the same box as Tupac, Elvis

07:24.740 --> 07:30.100
and Kurt Cobain, but it was clearly an appeal to XXXTentacion fans rather than a genuine

07:30.100 --> 07:31.100
statement.

07:31.100 --> 07:39.680
He always encourages people to leave their condolences in the comments below, and once

07:39.680 --> 07:43.380
again to the unassuming fan, they probably wouldn't think twice about that, but everyone

07:43.380 --> 07:46.480
knows that it aids the algorithms when a commenter engages.

07:46.480 --> 07:50.780
He loves taking advantage of the fans, he does the cheapest job possible, and that's

07:50.780 --> 07:53.460
what annoys many people, justifiably so.

07:53.460 --> 07:56.080
And make no mistake, McCrudden is an actor.

07:56.080 --> 08:04.660
He ended up on YouTube from an advert on Craigslist, it's clear he never had an intimate relationship

08:04.660 --> 08:08.380
with the platform, and it's not like he's lacking charisma necessarily, it's just

08:08.380 --> 08:09.940
clear that he's on autopilot.

08:09.940 --> 08:13.380
And when you're talking about someone's death, it seems somewhat important that you

08:13.380 --> 08:16.500
have a passion for the subject, especially when covering it.

08:16.500 --> 08:19.860
Although the Before They Were Dead series seems congruent with McCrudden's channel,

08:19.860 --> 08:22.380
it's hard to see it as a passion for what he talks about.

08:23.300 --> 08:27.460
He applies principles of morality with a conviction, he expands on base information, whereas McCrudden

08:27.460 --> 08:31.720
touches base with a plethora of points but never applies them, so he seems about as personally

08:31.720 --> 08:34.380
invested as someone reading off a teleprompter.

08:34.380 --> 08:38.180
This is a case of every one of his videos, but when applied to a situation that many

08:38.180 --> 08:42.980
would describe as fairly sensitive, it makes it even more tasteless, which is another thing

08:42.980 --> 08:46.040
we should break down, the sensitivity of a situation.

08:46.040 --> 08:50.420
I think people felt defensive over the fact that the situation involving X was one that

08:50.420 --> 08:54.660
ended rather abruptly and violently, there were still a lot of unanswered questions,

08:54.660 --> 08:57.220
and here McCrudden was pumping out those videos.

08:57.220 --> 09:01.620
A very interesting truth I've noticed was that people appear to be more defensive when

09:01.620 --> 09:06.000
the dead person was young or was a victim of tragic circumstances, I noticed a lot of

09:06.000 --> 09:10.260
people having banter about Stephen Hawking upon his death, however it seemed much more

09:10.260 --> 09:12.360
taboo when someone like X died.

09:12.360 --> 09:17.020
I think many people have the stern don't take advantage of a tragedy principle, don't

09:17.020 --> 09:19.980
capitalise on someone else's suffering.

09:19.980 --> 09:24.280
Suffering here is much stronger when there is an abject factor changing these circumstances,

09:24.280 --> 09:28.220
his life has not been brought to a tender close, it's been cut short, and here's

09:28.220 --> 09:30.740
McCrudden milking it until the cows come home.

09:30.740 --> 09:34.860
Speaking of capitalisation, that's another important asset to consider, how much is a

09:34.860 --> 09:37.860
person gaining from talking about this person's death?

09:37.860 --> 09:41.440
Why do many people refuse to monetise a video on such topics?

09:41.440 --> 09:45.860
Because they don't want to be seen as taking advantage of their death or any other catastrophes

09:45.860 --> 09:46.860
at that.

09:46.900 --> 09:51.420
McCrudden, once again, is not concerned with that and will slap multiple ads and even a

09:51.420 --> 09:55.020
cheeky sponsorship deal fully integrated with the topic.

10:16.860 --> 10:38.400
On top of that, even with the very short time frame since X's death in which these

10:38.400 --> 10:43.660
videos were made, McCrudden failed to bring any new attention necessary to these situations

10:43.660 --> 10:45.260
or any new outlook.

10:45.260 --> 10:50.260
He just rode on the coattails himself, nothing that would add depth to the context that he

10:50.260 --> 10:51.260
provides.

10:51.260 --> 10:55.400
Let's apply it to what we've just discussed and as a fair follow on, let's ask why does

10:55.400 --> 10:57.980
McCrudden cause all the outrage?

10:57.980 --> 11:02.380
Well when it comes to the most shameless exploitative content on a situation, it's quite easy

11:02.380 --> 11:05.740
to see why McCrudden is viewed as one of the worst on the spectrum.

11:05.740 --> 11:10.540
Of the conditions listed, he shows very little core interest on a topic, adds minimal transformative

11:10.540 --> 11:15.800
value, completely capitalises on the popularity without bringing any insight himself and milks

11:15.800 --> 11:19.980
it until it's dead, and milks it after it's dead too, visibly.

11:19.980 --> 11:23.880
Ironically, this makes him one of the most morally consistent people on the platform

11:23.880 --> 11:28.100
because it's easy to keep a moral code when you barely have one, therefore he's always

11:28.100 --> 11:32.900
somewhat above any criticism because the debate over receptability of topics is not one that

11:32.900 --> 11:37.260
can necessarily be decided by fact, it is just a simple case of where you draw the line

11:37.260 --> 11:38.260
personally.

11:38.260 --> 11:42.000
Personally, it's hard to base such topics on any foundation of absolute truth, so this

11:42.000 --> 11:46.520
leads to people saying, well he can do what he wants, and others going, well that doesn't

11:46.520 --> 11:47.520
make it right.

11:47.520 --> 11:51.840
With that said, I do not even believe McCrudden is the worst offender for all the criticism

11:51.840 --> 11:56.720
that can be brought about him, an individual like ImJayStation is incrementally worse as

11:56.720 --> 12:00.960
he is manipulating the circumstances around the death and using agreed fans and their

12:00.960 --> 12:05.400
hope that he might have something else to say after his passing, that is fairly disgusting,

12:05.400 --> 12:09.740
but people identify that much more easily, anything that involves active deception for

12:09.740 --> 12:14.040
emotional manipulation in my opinion is fairly pathetic, particularly when you're claiming

12:14.040 --> 12:18.540
to speak on behalf of the deceased individual, the subject matter only makes it worse.

12:18.540 --> 12:21.780
I think the morality is extremely clear on such an issue.

12:21.780 --> 12:27.820
Yeet yeet, let's hit 100k likes for xxxtentacion lads, we all know it's what he would have

12:27.820 --> 12:28.820
wanted.

12:28.820 --> 12:34.060
He also loved his own comment, if that isn't a sign of degeneracy, I do not know what is.

12:34.060 --> 12:38.300
Now the problem comes with commentary on the issue of how you avoid being a hypocrite

12:38.300 --> 12:41.800
when you're calling someone out, and to a degree, can you?

12:41.800 --> 12:46.480
The problem when discussing issues like morality is that it's a constant trap to avoid yourself

12:46.480 --> 12:51.080
being caught out, and it often leads to allegations of the hypocrisy that we've just said and

12:51.080 --> 12:52.080
so on.

12:52.080 --> 12:53.080
Why is this?

12:53.080 --> 12:57.320
Mainly because people place different emphasis on the assets that we've outlined today,

12:57.320 --> 13:01.620
some would argue that what you say in a video is irrelevant compared with how you advertise

13:01.620 --> 13:06.240
or what you gain off it, others would say it's just as comparable, and in fact sometimes

13:06.240 --> 13:10.260
people will hate you more than the person you're criticizing, particularly as commentators

13:10.260 --> 13:12.120
choose to take the moral high ground.

13:12.120 --> 13:16.600
People like McCrudden never claim to be moral, and without commentary they'd never be criticized.

13:16.600 --> 13:20.560
As you've probably seen, McCrudden's ratios are still pretty fine, in spite of the obvious

13:20.560 --> 13:34.600
exploitation.

13:34.600 --> 13:39.580
Another important question is what makes this sort of exploitation any worse than the reporting

13:39.580 --> 13:40.580
in the media?

13:40.580 --> 13:44.340
After all, all the news sites were rushing to report it and typically dramatize it, and

13:44.340 --> 13:45.660
they all run ads on it too.

13:45.660 --> 13:48.980
It's a fair question, and one that we have to reapply in a way.

13:48.980 --> 13:52.320
Usually we accept journalism sites under the premise that they report the news, so

13:52.320 --> 13:56.280
it's fairly ordinary that they would report this, and have it monetized too.

13:56.280 --> 13:59.240
McCrudden might say, well if they can do it, why can't I?

13:59.240 --> 14:04.200
And I don't think anyone really has a problem with reporting the death of XXXTentacion,

14:04.200 --> 14:09.200
if that's what is expected, however people do have a greater problem with media culture

14:09.200 --> 14:11.480
in the race to the bottom that they conduct.

14:11.480 --> 14:15.800
The only reason why we don't make videos on the media every time a shitty story is published

14:15.800 --> 14:18.680
is because we'd be making videos every fucking day.

14:18.680 --> 14:22.340
Mainstream media is criticised for putting clicks before actual stories, commentators

14:22.340 --> 14:26.800
are just trying to keep YouTube under the pulse to avoid falling down the same road.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.700
Just because it's expected doesn't mean it's accepted.

14:29.700 --> 14:33.700
We have a different moral code on YouTube, and one that I will definitely discuss later.

14:33.700 --> 14:37.140
The other point of the news is that in spite of my numerous criticisms of them, they do

14:37.140 --> 14:40.320
assist distribution of information to new audiences.

14:40.320 --> 14:45.420
Many people from certain backgrounds may not be aware of the rapper known as XXXTentacion,

14:45.420 --> 14:49.340
whereas I highly doubt many of the YouTube demographic found that McCrudden was breaking

14:49.340 --> 14:52.060
any news, particularly by the third time.

14:52.060 --> 14:56.420
So let's roleplay, you're an upcoming YouTuber, and you want to call all these bellends out

14:56.420 --> 15:00.140
because you don't think it's justified that grave robbers like McCrudden should be

15:00.140 --> 15:02.440
making money off other people's grief.

15:02.440 --> 15:06.300
That is fair enough, it's not a universal sentiment, but there's a strong case to

15:06.300 --> 15:07.300
be made.

15:07.300 --> 15:10.660
Let's ask a question, how do you call these people out while making sure you're not

15:10.660 --> 15:13.120
indulging in the same practices?

15:13.120 --> 15:17.520
Even in such a ravenous genre like commentary, most of your audience will not notice.

15:17.520 --> 15:22.400
But if you're not careful, it may come back to bite you when another more pedantic commentator

15:22.400 --> 15:26.100
picks it up and hones in on you, because when you actually make it, the knives are never

15:26.100 --> 15:27.480
far from your throat.

15:27.480 --> 15:29.840
So let's bring back the point about secondary topics.

15:29.840 --> 15:33.920
Given the way it's delivered, commentary tends to make most of these subjects secondary.

15:33.920 --> 15:37.720
We normally talk about other people using these particular topics, therefore it's

15:37.720 --> 15:42.200
important to make the individual in question the main target, rather than the topic they're

15:42.200 --> 15:45.460
talking about, particularly if you want to advertise it as that.

15:45.460 --> 15:49.600
I think that the risk you run with advertising it as the death topic is that if you then

15:49.600 --> 15:54.020
monetize and sponsor the video, it can make you very susceptible to being accused of acting

15:54.020 --> 15:55.020
no better.

15:55.020 --> 16:17.540
You're profiting off advertising on a video that you present about someone's demise,

16:17.540 --> 16:19.700
regardless of the content of the video.

16:19.700 --> 16:23.620
If you're not profiting off the video, then many would argue subscriber gains and views

16:24.620 --> 16:29.160
At that point, it's important to look on how much the video may be appealing to the

16:29.160 --> 16:31.380
algorithms, dishonestly at least.

16:31.380 --> 16:36.220
If we scoot over to ImAllexx's video, bar the satire tag, which people are in my opinion

16:36.220 --> 16:41.360
wrongfully correlating with algorithm side-stepping mechanisms, the tags are strictly relevant.

16:41.360 --> 16:44.960
Using slightly irrelevant tags for views is not looked on badly, most of the community

16:44.960 --> 16:48.580
does it, but when dealing with certain topics, it might be best to hold off.

16:48.580 --> 16:52.180
Many people would argue that those topics shouldn't be about views, even if you have

16:52.180 --> 16:53.180
a point to make.

16:53.740 --> 16:56.500
Now to point to a video that does this would be to point to James Merrick's video on

16:56.500 --> 16:57.500
Michael McCrudden.

16:57.500 --> 17:01.940
As it's advertised, it's prioritizing the primary topic, it addresses exactly why

17:01.940 --> 17:06.420
his depiction is an exceptional example, and does not milk the secondary topic nor seeks

17:06.420 --> 17:08.380
to exploit any audience grief.

17:08.380 --> 17:12.160
However, this does lead to some more deeper, more moral conundrums, and it's amazing

17:12.160 --> 17:14.740
what a simple topic like this can lend.

17:14.740 --> 17:18.820
Let's go there now.

17:18.820 --> 17:22.820
Just now, I mentioned that if you're a commentator, that to avoid being hammered as a hypocrite,

17:22.820 --> 17:27.460
you need to be somewhat sensitive with advertising, however there is another argument that addresses

17:27.460 --> 17:29.260
this point from a different perspective.

17:29.260 --> 17:32.920
And this is the means end point, and it's necessary that I present these arguments because

17:32.920 --> 17:36.640
everyone has these core feelings, and I know some people watching right now may have the

17:36.640 --> 17:41.700
nagging feeling that there is a case for being a bit dirty on the promotion of a well-intentioned

17:41.700 --> 17:44.500
video, even if it does risk running the point of hypocrisy.

17:44.500 --> 17:47.980
The reason that some people feel this way is because we look at people like McCrudden

17:47.980 --> 17:52.560
doing all these scummy actions to gain traction, and we want people to see our videos calling

17:52.560 --> 17:57.000
them out, and we know that if they're using underhanded tactics to own the algorithm,

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
we want people to see our videos on them, and to make sure they're not taking advantage

18:01.000 --> 18:03.660
of that audience, we want to help make people aware.

18:03.660 --> 18:08.600
It becomes a question of the greater good, and it's a legitimate point, and one that

18:08.600 --> 18:09.960
must be considered.

18:09.960 --> 18:14.560
In those instances, I think it is partly about the point you're making, and if you're going

18:14.560 --> 18:17.680
to be a bit more clickbait with your topics at the end of the day, you're never going

18:17.680 --> 18:22.080
to please everyone, however if you focus on the primary topic enough on an individual

18:22.080 --> 18:25.600
like McCrudden, and you have a strong point to make while keeping it consistent with the

18:25.600 --> 18:28.440
tone of the channel, then you can use that secondary topic.

18:28.440 --> 18:32.120
I will make this video slightly attractive to the human eye, and that's mainly because

18:32.120 --> 18:38.040
it will be advertised as a piece about McCrudden, and the point about XXXTentacion comes secondary.

18:38.040 --> 18:42.160
You shouldn't be shy about a piece if your inclusion of the topic is somewhat natural

18:42.160 --> 18:45.640
and necessary, and I'm trying to think of the most basic way to break this down for

18:45.640 --> 18:46.640
you lads.

18:46.640 --> 18:49.340
This is something that is actually quite a common discussion in the political sphere

18:49.340 --> 18:52.500
of YouTube, particularly the more controversial sex of the wings.

18:52.500 --> 18:57.460
At what point is it necessary to do something immoral to prevent a perceived greater evil?

18:57.460 --> 19:02.300
The issue is that, applied here, your normal audience may not view McCrudden as a greater

19:02.300 --> 19:06.740
evil when they are first introduced to your video, and therefore jumping in with perhaps

19:06.740 --> 19:10.520
questionable actions, even if we want to think that what we're doing is something better,

19:10.520 --> 19:14.420
in a way convincing people that you're an authority on these things means behaving in

19:14.420 --> 19:18.540
a way that will reflect said principles, particularly on first impressions.

19:18.540 --> 19:22.460
With that said, if we want to become slightly Machiavellian in this bitch, most people probably

19:22.460 --> 19:26.520
won't notice subtle appeals to the algorithm, although you'll probably be criticised even

19:26.520 --> 19:28.000
more if you're caught out.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.940
So my advice is, if you do it, you do it at your own risk.

19:30.940 --> 19:34.900
It's not necessarily a bad thing to make sure people are seeing you calling McCrudden out,

19:34.900 --> 19:38.880
but at the same time, you will risk undermining your own credibility.

19:38.880 --> 19:42.100
Logic and Argumentation As commentators, when we make a video, we

19:42.100 --> 19:43.760
choose the point to make.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.340
This is where we select the thesis.

19:45.340 --> 19:49.900
So we might select the thesis, Michael McCrudden is a shitty human being, which is a fairly

19:49.900 --> 19:54.500
monetisable topic on concept, however when attempting to prove that argument, you might

19:54.500 --> 19:59.520
come across certain topics that are more sensitive, however to use those topics doesn't necessarily

19:59.520 --> 20:03.520
undermine the truth of your point, it just means that you may need to refer to them.

20:03.520 --> 20:07.260
If you're doing a channel where you constantly call people out for taking advantage of others,

20:07.260 --> 20:10.880
then you might feel you deserve a fair bit of dollar for it, I think it's just important

20:10.880 --> 20:14.540
in those instances to make sure you're being honest with what you're advertising.

20:14.540 --> 20:16.760
This however leads us to another question.

20:16.760 --> 20:20.360
When we say people shouldn't be exploiting sensitive situations, what do we want to be

20:20.360 --> 20:21.360
the result of it?

20:21.360 --> 20:25.480
There's a really interesting video made by Willimaxshow, it's quite a controversial piece

20:25.480 --> 20:27.500
and I've even argued about it with him.

20:27.500 --> 20:31.320
However in the video, he attacks PewDiePie and H3 for criticising Logan Paul's treatment

20:31.320 --> 20:35.300
of the Japanese culture in the run up to the incident, he asserted that what they did was

20:35.300 --> 20:39.740
rather hypocritical given their history, however a greater point that I took is that we must

20:39.740 --> 20:44.120
be careful with how we approach such topics so that we as commentators are not caught

20:44.120 --> 20:45.120
in the crossfire.

20:45.120 --> 20:49.100
As mentioned earlier, YouTube has a very different culture to media, it's one that I'm pretty

20:49.100 --> 20:50.100
proud of to be honest.

20:50.100 --> 20:53.680
We tend to feel a lot more inclined to look at a person's moral fabric rather than the

20:53.680 --> 20:56.220
reactionary attention of actions.

20:56.220 --> 21:00.500
We must be careful to clarify about what we are criticising people for, and we must hold

21:00.500 --> 21:04.580
on to a very concise narrative, and look at the person and look at the action and create

21:04.580 --> 21:08.920
a context and don't just leave it to the audience, and most importantly in this case,

21:08.920 --> 21:09.920
the media.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.940
As a collective, we should be careful with what we condemn, everything I've discussed

21:12.940 --> 21:16.920
today is relevant, because if we go around pointing fingers at people for doing certain

21:16.920 --> 21:21.680
things on vague terms, we might cause the rules to be imposed on ourselves that equally

21:21.680 --> 21:25.660
fail to distinguish the context that we didn't do when we made those videos.

21:25.660 --> 21:29.440
When people call others hypocrites, it's not because they're necessarily trying to undermine

21:29.440 --> 21:34.120
us, it may just be that we haven't argued or presented or even advertised our points

21:34.120 --> 21:38.260
properly, particularly when you consider the sort of grudge the mainstream media do have

21:38.260 --> 21:39.400
against the platform.

21:39.400 --> 21:44.020
Many of us do think it's fair to distinguish between the chaotic good YouTubers like iDubbbz

21:44.020 --> 21:46.380
and the sort of creed that McCrudden represents.

21:46.380 --> 21:49.820
We also need to think about what we expect in response to these actions.

21:49.820 --> 21:54.340
Many people justifiably wanted action taken against Logan Paul for his little forest excursion,

21:54.340 --> 21:57.340
but should we really lump his preceding actions onto that?

21:57.340 --> 22:00.540
Would we really want for the other situations to necessarily be punished?

22:00.540 --> 22:02.600
What do we want for people like McCrudden?

22:02.600 --> 22:03.600
Probably not the same.

22:03.600 --> 22:07.340
Mostly, I think it's just really important to put forward a compelling case and allow

22:07.340 --> 22:11.400
the audience to deduce why maybe they shouldn't be supporting these YouTubers.

22:11.400 --> 22:15.360
We should try and convince them that McCrudden is not worth watching rather than have the

22:15.360 --> 22:19.340
greater website intervene because the algorithms that they will run are general.

22:19.340 --> 22:22.820
They don't distinguish the levels of context that I've discussed today.

22:22.820 --> 22:25.880
If they did, that would be fantastic, but they won't.

22:25.880 --> 22:28.200
We all know that would be wishful thinking.

22:28.200 --> 22:32.240
Displaying morality on this platform is a lot more complex than it might seem on the

22:32.240 --> 22:33.240
surface.

22:33.240 --> 22:36.280
Dealing with sensitive topics, calling out others who exploit them, while not being labelled

22:36.280 --> 22:40.720
hypocrite, and knowing what is worth calling out and how to avoid jeopardising our own

22:40.720 --> 22:41.900
content through it.

22:41.900 --> 22:46.180
It's quite a spiderweb in which it is easy to be caught in, but it's always important

22:46.180 --> 22:47.620
to retain that control.

22:47.620 --> 22:51.340
However, with some thought, you can hopefully clear out the bearings on your moral compass

22:51.340 --> 22:55.260
and be able to make those strong statements, like the one I'm about to make.

22:55.260 --> 23:00.140
Michael McCrudden is a scummy human being and he capitalises on the suffering of other

23:00.140 --> 23:01.140
people.

23:01.140 --> 23:04.640
Judging from what we've observed, his motivations are anything but pure.

23:04.640 --> 23:09.140
For example, the Lil Peep video that we discussed earlier, briefly made by James Merrick, pointed

23:09.140 --> 23:12.660
out how he literally copied and pasted his content from a month before.

23:12.660 --> 23:16.540
There's not someone who cares about these people who have died tragically.

23:16.540 --> 23:20.980
You know, XXXTentacion, very controversial bloke, without a doubt, but I would say, there

23:20.980 --> 23:25.440
are many people, even people I know, who clearly had their lives affected by him, even though

23:25.440 --> 23:26.740
I don't completely get it.

23:26.740 --> 23:30.780
And therefore, for McCrudden to step in, to act like he had some sort of connection with

23:30.780 --> 23:33.180
him, to act like he had something to bring.

23:33.180 --> 23:34.180
Three times over.

23:34.220 --> 23:36.120
He's not a nice bloke.

23:36.120 --> 23:40.240
Anyhow, those are my thoughts on morality, Michael McCrudden, and so much more.

23:40.240 --> 23:43.720
I would love to hear what you think about it, because it is a very complex topic and

23:43.720 --> 23:48.120
I know that we're not completely dealing with all the intricacies right here, right now.

23:48.120 --> 23:52.180
However, hopefully it does stimulate some sort of discussion that we can take forward.

23:52.180 --> 23:56.400
Hopefully it'll inspire people to draw a much clearer line on how they feel about these

23:56.400 --> 23:57.400
topics.

23:57.400 --> 23:58.400
Let me know down below.

23:58.400 --> 24:01.920
I'd also like to thank my editors who once again have done a fantastic job, I'll leave

24:01.920 --> 24:04.660
all their links in the pinned comment most likely.

24:04.660 --> 24:08.900
Definitely check them out, I can't give them enough credit, they just do a great job every

24:08.900 --> 24:10.540
single time.

24:10.540 --> 24:15.380
Not too much else to say, if you want to reach me on Twitter, at The Right Pinion, Facebook,

24:15.380 --> 24:20.260
Discord, links below, you can find me all there, I'm an accessible person and I do my

24:20.260 --> 24:21.260
best to be.

24:21.260 --> 24:25.380
However, until we reach that bridge, I'm The Right Pinion, and I'll see you in the next

24:25.380 --> 24:25.880
one.

24:31.920 --> 24:33.920
Thanks for watching, I'll see you in the next one.
