0	8860	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
8860	9860	too much free time.
9860	13020	And boy, have I been waiting a long time to do this video, and in a way, I could have
13020	16700	done it sooner, but there's just a timeless appeal of the discourse to me.
16700	20480	I had bigger fish to fry at the time, so I left it in the lake, but now The Right Opinion
20480	21780	has his rod out.
21780	24240	Wait, that sounded much better in my head.
24240	28100	But anyhow, before we go off on a tangent about The Right Opinion's rod, this man is
28100	29100	Michael McCrudden.
29100	30780	Michael McCrudden is a person.
30780	35760	I use person to the most broad effect, but he does still classify in my books as a human
35760	36760	being, just about.
36760	39900	He has been the topic of hot controversy in the last few months.
39900	43940	You see, Michael McCrudden owns his channel, in which he talks about celebrities before
43940	47940	they were famous, after they were famous, their rich life, a few other side series,
47940	50220	and most notoriously, before they were gone.
50220	53480	We'll be using the last one to talk about a lot of questions that have been flaring
53480	57580	up amongst the community, because McCrudden has probably been the best example of what
57580	61780	happens when people become slightly too opportunistic and slip into the public eye.
61780	62780	But why?
62780	67260	Well, when someone passes away, many think it's important to be respectful of the deceased
67260	70700	and give them and their family some space during the times of mourning.
70700	74180	However, McCrudden's philosophy has come to show that he might not be so concerned
74180	75180	with that.
75180	78500	Now, I've always been aware, vaguely, of McCrudden's channel, but more as an onlooker
78500	79500	rather than a commentator.
79500	83780	He's a significant size, in spite of the incredibly inconsistent view counts.
83780	87700	Rather than the regular allegations that not all of his facts are completely accurate,
87700	90940	the first taste of controversy that he gave me was when my friend James Merritt decided
90940	92540	to release a video criticising him.
92540	96140	I definitely urge you to check out James' content, it's very good, and that particular
96140	99100	video is one that we will definitely revisit in a bit.
99100	101420	It definitely levels some very legitimate criticisms.
101420	105300	I considered covering it back then, but it wasn't exactly my cup of tea.
105300	108820	However, over the last couple months, it is definitely brewed, and now the right opinion
108820	112180	is ready to serve up some piping hot Earl Grey.
112180	113180	Delicious.
113180	117580	McCrudden, on the other hand, is finding himself in a metaphorical sort of hot water.
117580	122280	After the sudden death of extremely popular and equally controversial rapper XXXTentacion,
122280	126540	he was criticised for making not one, not two, but three videos in quick succession,
126540	128380	all capitalising on this event.
128380	130660	They were shameless to say the least.
130660	134280	No matter what genre he stepped into or what he was talking about, everyone knew there
134280	141100	was a real unique artist here, a true talent, one of a kind.
141100	144880	These led to a lot of outrage and criticism, which subsequently led to a lot of videos,
144880	148120	and then consequently led to a lot of people asking if these videos were hypocritical on
148120	151460	how they behaved, and if McCrudden was even in the wrong at all.
151460	154660	People were tripping over themselves in an attempt to have the moral high ground.
154660	158360	A similar situation occurred earlier this year with Logan Paul, many asserted that those
158360	162020	who made videos on his little voyage were no better than him, particularly those who
162020	164380	then decided to monetise and sponsor those videos.
164380	168340	And when there are slight details like the ones in question, it doesn't necessarily
168340	171500	make you a bad person because you may not be thinking about it.
171500	175940	However, I am the right opinion, the blessed messiah for all your argumentation, and I've
175940	179420	been mulling over this for a while, and I've proposed myself to be the one to lay out some
179420	184020	conditions that may affect whether a situation could be considered distasteful and to help
184020	186540	you have a clearer grip on your opinion.
186540	191520	Allow me to clarify that in this video I will mostly be avoiding pushing for one position.
191520	195800	If you're here for the more opinionated content, don't worry, there's plenty of that to come
195800	196800	in the future.
196800	201440	This is a bit more of an analytical piece, I will state my opinion at the end after applying
201440	205280	all the conditions that I deem relevant, but the thing is there are many reasoned arguments
205280	208540	that can be made for all points of view in this instance, but hopefully by the end we'll
208540	213000	be able to distinguish the I'm Alex's from the Michael McCrudden's, if you know what
213000	214000	I mean.
214000	216980	You might come out thinking neither of them were acceptable, you might come out thinking
216980	221440	both of them were acceptable, but let's clear the air and understand why we think
221440	222440	are acceptable.
222440	223440	Alright?
223440	224440	Great.
224440	228080	Can't think of anything else to say so, that was a nice short dicey intro, without further
228080	230400	ado, let's get right into it.
235200	239800	Today I will be talking about XXXTentacion in large volumes.
239800	243680	It makes sense, in a way, it is the inflammatory source of the video.
243680	247500	Without this Michael McCrudden saga, this probably wouldn't exist, however most people
247500	251720	will not be attacking me for mentioning it, monetising it, in the same way that people
251720	252880	attack McCrudden.
252880	255000	What changes the situation?
255000	256000	Context.
256000	260800	It's a simple answer, but it's easy to forget when people are riled up about topics.
260800	264560	There are many elements of context, and ones that we should be breaking down very concisely.
264560	269520	We're going to use multiple examples, I'll be using McCrudden's, probably James Merritt's,
269520	273380	and also probably I'm Alex's, because I know this video as well, and I understand
273380	276920	what was being said in them, and these are all interesting cases which can yield some
276920	278100	strong debate.
278100	281400	So let's break it down, because McCrudden is not a commentator.
281400	285640	And in the McCrudden videos, XXXTentacion's death was a primary subject.
285640	291000	It was the key clincher for a lot of viewers, he advertised them as videos on the topic,
291000	293840	and had them central to the videos at hand.
293840	298140	Generally I find the sensitive topics as a commentator either come across as primary
298140	302440	or secondary subjects, obviously the primary being what I've just described, the one
302440	306060	where you make it the central point, however videos like this one that you're watching
306060	308540	right now may include it as a supplement.
308540	312940	Generally I think most of the scrutiny focuses around videos that have it as their primary
312940	317300	topic, however a very interesting debate around YouTube is obviously the unique culture within
317300	319500	that prevails secondary topics.
319500	320500	Clickbait culture.
320500	325180	The fate of a 10 minute video could hinge on a brief glance of a thumbnail and title,
325180	329820	and therefore a title can actually be more important than the topic of a video in determining
329820	333100	whether an action is disrespectful or not, because it's the views that will bring
333100	335640	you any subsequent traction and ad revenue.
335640	340000	So although in many cases the topic of the content may define how someone judges it,
340000	343440	it's more how you gain the attention that would dictate whether it's more or less
343440	344440	susceptible.
344440	348380	So in YouTube's position you might have the topic as a secondary on the video but
348380	351300	still be using their depth to a significant effect.
351300	355320	This is why some people raised the issue with I Am Alex's video, the idea that although
355320	360060	his video was more focusing on others and their reaction, his title and thumbnail referenced
360060	365020	XXXTentacion much more heavily than the subjects of his actual video, and therefore he drew
365060	370940	people in because he prioritised XXXTentacion's death as the subject in his thumbnail and
370940	375220	title, but I can understand why people accused him of hypocrisy despite the fact that his
375220	378640	video was fairly strong in all of its points.
378640	382840	And obviously equally important is what you say when you have the attention, if it's
382840	386220	a secondary topic it's much more likely that you've integrated it with a greater
386220	389980	narrative regardless, so there's not much to debate in that instance, however in your
389980	394620	primary topic ask yourself, why are you doing the video, what are you going to bring to
394620	395620	the topic.
395620	399180	With someone like Michael McCrudden, although the topic is consistent to his channel, he
399180	402940	clearly lacks a knowledge in the topic whilst still acting like he was somewhat familiar
402940	404740	with the individual in question.
404740	408940	There is nothing in his videos apart from surface level observations, nothing to develop
408940	413500	on his character, and nothing anyone could really not find elsewhere, and he can't
413500	418820	even pronounce the school's name despite having an image of it on screen, it's Margate.
418820	440600	Which led to him getting expelled from Margaret Middle School.
440600	444740	When speaking about him, I would describe him or put him in the same box as Tupac, Elvis
444740	450100	and Kurt Cobain, but it was clearly an appeal to XXXTentacion fans rather than a genuine
450100	451100	statement.
451100	459680	He always encourages people to leave their condolences in the comments below, and once
459680	463380	again to the unassuming fan, they probably wouldn't think twice about that, but everyone
463380	466480	knows that it aids the algorithms when a commenter engages.
466480	470780	He loves taking advantage of the fans, he does the cheapest job possible, and that's
470780	473460	what annoys many people, justifiably so.
473460	476080	And make no mistake, McCrudden is an actor.
476080	484660	He ended up on YouTube from an advert on Craigslist, it's clear he never had an intimate relationship
484660	488380	with the platform, and it's not like he's lacking charisma necessarily, it's just
488380	489940	clear that he's on autopilot.
489940	493380	And when you're talking about someone's death, it seems somewhat important that you
493380	496500	have a passion for the subject, especially when covering it.
496500	499860	Although the Before They Were Dead series seems congruent with McCrudden's channel,
499860	502380	it's hard to see it as a passion for what he talks about.
503300	507460	He applies principles of morality with a conviction, he expands on base information, whereas McCrudden
507460	511720	touches base with a plethora of points but never applies them, so he seems about as personally
511720	514380	invested as someone reading off a teleprompter.
514380	518180	This is a case of every one of his videos, but when applied to a situation that many
518180	522980	would describe as fairly sensitive, it makes it even more tasteless, which is another thing
522980	526040	we should break down, the sensitivity of a situation.
526040	530420	I think people felt defensive over the fact that the situation involving X was one that
530420	534660	ended rather abruptly and violently, there were still a lot of unanswered questions,
534660	537220	and here McCrudden was pumping out those videos.
537220	541620	A very interesting truth I've noticed was that people appear to be more defensive when
541620	546000	the dead person was young or was a victim of tragic circumstances, I noticed a lot of
546000	550260	people having banter about Stephen Hawking upon his death, however it seemed much more
550260	552360	taboo when someone like X died.
552360	557020	I think many people have the stern don't take advantage of a tragedy principle, don't
557020	559980	capitalise on someone else's suffering.
559980	564280	Suffering here is much stronger when there is an abject factor changing these circumstances,
564280	568220	his life has not been brought to a tender close, it's been cut short, and here's
568220	570740	McCrudden milking it until the cows come home.
570740	574860	Speaking of capitalisation, that's another important asset to consider, how much is a
574860	577860	person gaining from talking about this person's death?
577860	581440	Why do many people refuse to monetise a video on such topics?
581440	585860	Because they don't want to be seen as taking advantage of their death or any other catastrophes
585860	586860	at that.
586900	591420	McCrudden, once again, is not concerned with that and will slap multiple ads and even a
591420	595020	cheeky sponsorship deal fully integrated with the topic.
616860	638400	On top of that, even with the very short time frame since X's death in which these
638400	643660	videos were made, McCrudden failed to bring any new attention necessary to these situations
643660	645260	or any new outlook.
645260	650260	He just rode on the coattails himself, nothing that would add depth to the context that he
650260	651260	provides.
651260	655400	Let's apply it to what we've just discussed and as a fair follow on, let's ask why does
655400	657980	McCrudden cause all the outrage?
657980	662380	Well when it comes to the most shameless exploitative content on a situation, it's quite easy
662380	665740	to see why McCrudden is viewed as one of the worst on the spectrum.
665740	670540	Of the conditions listed, he shows very little core interest on a topic, adds minimal transformative
670540	675800	value, completely capitalises on the popularity without bringing any insight himself and milks
675800	679980	it until it's dead, and milks it after it's dead too, visibly.
679980	683880	Ironically, this makes him one of the most morally consistent people on the platform
683880	688100	because it's easy to keep a moral code when you barely have one, therefore he's always
688100	692900	somewhat above any criticism because the debate over receptability of topics is not one that
692900	697260	can necessarily be decided by fact, it is just a simple case of where you draw the line
697260	698260	personally.
698260	702000	Personally, it's hard to base such topics on any foundation of absolute truth, so this
702000	706520	leads to people saying, well he can do what he wants, and others going, well that doesn't
706520	707520	make it right.
707520	711840	With that said, I do not even believe McCrudden is the worst offender for all the criticism
711840	716720	that can be brought about him, an individual like ImJayStation is incrementally worse as
716720	720960	he is manipulating the circumstances around the death and using agreed fans and their
720960	725400	hope that he might have something else to say after his passing, that is fairly disgusting,
725400	729740	but people identify that much more easily, anything that involves active deception for
729740	734040	emotional manipulation in my opinion is fairly pathetic, particularly when you're claiming
734040	738540	to speak on behalf of the deceased individual, the subject matter only makes it worse.
738540	741780	I think the morality is extremely clear on such an issue.
741780	747820	Yeet yeet, let's hit 100k likes for xxxtentacion lads, we all know it's what he would have
747820	748820	wanted.
748820	754060	He also loved his own comment, if that isn't a sign of degeneracy, I do not know what is.
754060	758300	Now the problem comes with commentary on the issue of how you avoid being a hypocrite
758300	761800	when you're calling someone out, and to a degree, can you?
761800	766480	The problem when discussing issues like morality is that it's a constant trap to avoid yourself
766480	771080	being caught out, and it often leads to allegations of the hypocrisy that we've just said and
771080	772080	so on.
772080	773080	Why is this?
773080	777320	Mainly because people place different emphasis on the assets that we've outlined today,
777320	781620	some would argue that what you say in a video is irrelevant compared with how you advertise
781620	786240	or what you gain off it, others would say it's just as comparable, and in fact sometimes
786240	790260	people will hate you more than the person you're criticizing, particularly as commentators
790260	792120	choose to take the moral high ground.
792120	796600	People like McCrudden never claim to be moral, and without commentary they'd never be criticized.
796600	800560	As you've probably seen, McCrudden's ratios are still pretty fine, in spite of the obvious
800560	814600	exploitation.
814600	819580	Another important question is what makes this sort of exploitation any worse than the reporting
819580	820580	in the media?
820580	824340	After all, all the news sites were rushing to report it and typically dramatize it, and
824340	825660	they all run ads on it too.
825660	828980	It's a fair question, and one that we have to reapply in a way.
828980	832320	Usually we accept journalism sites under the premise that they report the news, so
832320	836280	it's fairly ordinary that they would report this, and have it monetized too.
836280	839240	McCrudden might say, well if they can do it, why can't I?
839240	844200	And I don't think anyone really has a problem with reporting the death of XXXTentacion,
844200	849200	if that's what is expected, however people do have a greater problem with media culture
849200	851480	in the race to the bottom that they conduct.
851480	855800	The only reason why we don't make videos on the media every time a shitty story is published
855800	858680	is because we'd be making videos every fucking day.
858680	862340	Mainstream media is criticised for putting clicks before actual stories, commentators
862340	866800	are just trying to keep YouTube under the pulse to avoid falling down the same road.
866800	869700	Just because it's expected doesn't mean it's accepted.
869700	873700	We have a different moral code on YouTube, and one that I will definitely discuss later.
873700	877140	The other point of the news is that in spite of my numerous criticisms of them, they do
877140	880320	assist distribution of information to new audiences.
880320	885420	Many people from certain backgrounds may not be aware of the rapper known as XXXTentacion,
885420	889340	whereas I highly doubt many of the YouTube demographic found that McCrudden was breaking
889340	892060	any news, particularly by the third time.
892060	896420	So let's roleplay, you're an upcoming YouTuber, and you want to call all these bellends out
896420	900140	because you don't think it's justified that grave robbers like McCrudden should be
900140	902440	making money off other people's grief.
902440	906300	That is fair enough, it's not a universal sentiment, but there's a strong case to
906300	907300	be made.
907300	910660	Let's ask a question, how do you call these people out while making sure you're not
910660	913120	indulging in the same practices?
913120	917520	Even in such a ravenous genre like commentary, most of your audience will not notice.
917520	922400	But if you're not careful, it may come back to bite you when another more pedantic commentator
922400	926100	picks it up and hones in on you, because when you actually make it, the knives are never
926100	927480	far from your throat.
927480	929840	So let's bring back the point about secondary topics.
929840	933920	Given the way it's delivered, commentary tends to make most of these subjects secondary.
933920	937720	We normally talk about other people using these particular topics, therefore it's
937720	942200	important to make the individual in question the main target, rather than the topic they're
942200	945460	talking about, particularly if you want to advertise it as that.
945460	949600	I think that the risk you run with advertising it as the death topic is that if you then
949600	954020	monetize and sponsor the video, it can make you very susceptible to being accused of acting
954020	955020	no better.
955020	977540	You're profiting off advertising on a video that you present about someone's demise,
977540	979700	regardless of the content of the video.
979700	983620	If you're not profiting off the video, then many would argue subscriber gains and views
984620	989160	At that point, it's important to look on how much the video may be appealing to the
989160	991380	algorithms, dishonestly at least.
991380	996220	If we scoot over to ImAllexx's video, bar the satire tag, which people are in my opinion
996220	1001360	wrongfully correlating with algorithm side-stepping mechanisms, the tags are strictly relevant.
1001360	1004960	Using slightly irrelevant tags for views is not looked on badly, most of the community
1004960	1008580	does it, but when dealing with certain topics, it might be best to hold off.
1008580	1012180	Many people would argue that those topics shouldn't be about views, even if you have
1012180	1013180	a point to make.
1013740	1016500	Now to point to a video that does this would be to point to James Merrick's video on
1016500	1017500	Michael McCrudden.
1017500	1021940	As it's advertised, it's prioritizing the primary topic, it addresses exactly why
1021940	1026420	his depiction is an exceptional example, and does not milk the secondary topic nor seeks
1026420	1028380	to exploit any audience grief.
1028380	1032160	However, this does lead to some more deeper, more moral conundrums, and it's amazing
1032160	1034740	what a simple topic like this can lend.
1034740	1038820	Let's go there now.
1038820	1042820	Just now, I mentioned that if you're a commentator, that to avoid being hammered as a hypocrite,
1042820	1047460	you need to be somewhat sensitive with advertising, however there is another argument that addresses
1047460	1049260	this point from a different perspective.
1049260	1052920	And this is the means end point, and it's necessary that I present these arguments because
1052920	1056640	everyone has these core feelings, and I know some people watching right now may have the
1056640	1061700	nagging feeling that there is a case for being a bit dirty on the promotion of a well-intentioned
1061700	1064500	video, even if it does risk running the point of hypocrisy.
1064500	1067980	The reason that some people feel this way is because we look at people like McCrudden
1067980	1072560	doing all these scummy actions to gain traction, and we want people to see our videos calling
1072560	1077000	them out, and we know that if they're using underhanded tactics to own the algorithm,
1077000	1081000	we want people to see our videos on them, and to make sure they're not taking advantage
1081000	1083660	of that audience, we want to help make people aware.
1083660	1088600	It becomes a question of the greater good, and it's a legitimate point, and one that
1088600	1089960	must be considered.
1089960	1094560	In those instances, I think it is partly about the point you're making, and if you're going
1094560	1097680	to be a bit more clickbait with your topics at the end of the day, you're never going
1097680	1102080	to please everyone, however if you focus on the primary topic enough on an individual
1102080	1105600	like McCrudden, and you have a strong point to make while keeping it consistent with the
1105600	1108440	tone of the channel, then you can use that secondary topic.
1108440	1112120	I will make this video slightly attractive to the human eye, and that's mainly because
1112120	1118040	it will be advertised as a piece about McCrudden, and the point about XXXTentacion comes secondary.
1118040	1122160	You shouldn't be shy about a piece if your inclusion of the topic is somewhat natural
1122160	1125640	and necessary, and I'm trying to think of the most basic way to break this down for
1125640	1126640	you lads.
1126640	1129340	This is something that is actually quite a common discussion in the political sphere
1129340	1132500	of YouTube, particularly the more controversial sex of the wings.
1132500	1137460	At what point is it necessary to do something immoral to prevent a perceived greater evil?
1137460	1142300	The issue is that, applied here, your normal audience may not view McCrudden as a greater
1142300	1146740	evil when they are first introduced to your video, and therefore jumping in with perhaps
1146740	1150520	questionable actions, even if we want to think that what we're doing is something better,
1150520	1154420	in a way convincing people that you're an authority on these things means behaving in
1154420	1158540	a way that will reflect said principles, particularly on first impressions.
1158540	1162460	With that said, if we want to become slightly Machiavellian in this bitch, most people probably
1162460	1166520	won't notice subtle appeals to the algorithm, although you'll probably be criticised even
1166520	1168000	more if you're caught out.
1168000	1170940	So my advice is, if you do it, you do it at your own risk.
1170940	1174900	It's not necessarily a bad thing to make sure people are seeing you calling McCrudden out,
1174900	1178880	but at the same time, you will risk undermining your own credibility.
1178880	1182100	Logic and Argumentation As commentators, when we make a video, we
1182100	1183760	choose the point to make.
1183760	1185340	This is where we select the thesis.
1185340	1189900	So we might select the thesis, Michael McCrudden is a shitty human being, which is a fairly
1189900	1194500	monetisable topic on concept, however when attempting to prove that argument, you might
1194500	1199520	come across certain topics that are more sensitive, however to use those topics doesn't necessarily
1199520	1203520	undermine the truth of your point, it just means that you may need to refer to them.
1203520	1207260	If you're doing a channel where you constantly call people out for taking advantage of others,
1207260	1210880	then you might feel you deserve a fair bit of dollar for it, I think it's just important
1210880	1214540	in those instances to make sure you're being honest with what you're advertising.
1214540	1216760	This however leads us to another question.
1216760	1220360	When we say people shouldn't be exploiting sensitive situations, what do we want to be
1220360	1221360	the result of it?
1221360	1225480	There's a really interesting video made by Willimaxshow, it's quite a controversial piece
1225480	1227500	and I've even argued about it with him.
1227500	1231320	However in the video, he attacks PewDiePie and H3 for criticising Logan Paul's treatment
1231320	1235300	of the Japanese culture in the run up to the incident, he asserted that what they did was
1235300	1239740	rather hypocritical given their history, however a greater point that I took is that we must
1239740	1244120	be careful with how we approach such topics so that we as commentators are not caught
1244120	1245120	in the crossfire.
1245120	1249100	As mentioned earlier, YouTube has a very different culture to media, it's one that I'm pretty
1249100	1250100	proud of to be honest.
1250100	1253680	We tend to feel a lot more inclined to look at a person's moral fabric rather than the
1253680	1256220	reactionary attention of actions.
1256220	1260500	We must be careful to clarify about what we are criticising people for, and we must hold
1260500	1264580	on to a very concise narrative, and look at the person and look at the action and create
1264580	1268920	a context and don't just leave it to the audience, and most importantly in this case,
1268920	1269920	the media.
1269920	1272940	As a collective, we should be careful with what we condemn, everything I've discussed
1272940	1276920	today is relevant, because if we go around pointing fingers at people for doing certain
1276920	1281680	things on vague terms, we might cause the rules to be imposed on ourselves that equally
1281680	1285660	fail to distinguish the context that we didn't do when we made those videos.
1285660	1289440	When people call others hypocrites, it's not because they're necessarily trying to undermine
1289440	1294120	us, it may just be that we haven't argued or presented or even advertised our points
1294120	1298260	properly, particularly when you consider the sort of grudge the mainstream media do have
1298260	1299400	against the platform.
1299400	1304020	Many of us do think it's fair to distinguish between the chaotic good YouTubers like iDubbbz
1304020	1306380	and the sort of creed that McCrudden represents.
1306380	1309820	We also need to think about what we expect in response to these actions.
1309820	1314340	Many people justifiably wanted action taken against Logan Paul for his little forest excursion,
1314340	1317340	but should we really lump his preceding actions onto that?
1317340	1320540	Would we really want for the other situations to necessarily be punished?
1320540	1322600	What do we want for people like McCrudden?
1322600	1323600	Probably not the same.
1323600	1327340	Mostly, I think it's just really important to put forward a compelling case and allow
1327340	1331400	the audience to deduce why maybe they shouldn't be supporting these YouTubers.
1331400	1335360	We should try and convince them that McCrudden is not worth watching rather than have the
1335360	1339340	greater website intervene because the algorithms that they will run are general.
1339340	1342820	They don't distinguish the levels of context that I've discussed today.
1342820	1345880	If they did, that would be fantastic, but they won't.
1345880	1348200	We all know that would be wishful thinking.
1348200	1352240	Displaying morality on this platform is a lot more complex than it might seem on the
1352240	1353240	surface.
1353240	1356280	Dealing with sensitive topics, calling out others who exploit them, while not being labelled
1356280	1360720	hypocrite, and knowing what is worth calling out and how to avoid jeopardising our own
1360720	1361900	content through it.
1361900	1366180	It's quite a spiderweb in which it is easy to be caught in, but it's always important
1366180	1367620	to retain that control.
1367620	1371340	However, with some thought, you can hopefully clear out the bearings on your moral compass
1371340	1375260	and be able to make those strong statements, like the one I'm about to make.
1375260	1380140	Michael McCrudden is a scummy human being and he capitalises on the suffering of other
1380140	1381140	people.
1381140	1384640	Judging from what we've observed, his motivations are anything but pure.
1384640	1389140	For example, the Lil Peep video that we discussed earlier, briefly made by James Merrick, pointed
1389140	1392660	out how he literally copied and pasted his content from a month before.
1392660	1396540	There's not someone who cares about these people who have died tragically.
1396540	1400980	You know, XXXTentacion, very controversial bloke, without a doubt, but I would say, there
1400980	1405440	are many people, even people I know, who clearly had their lives affected by him, even though
1405440	1406740	I don't completely get it.
1406740	1410780	And therefore, for McCrudden to step in, to act like he had some sort of connection with
1410780	1413180	him, to act like he had something to bring.
1413180	1414180	Three times over.
1414220	1416120	He's not a nice bloke.
1416120	1420240	Anyhow, those are my thoughts on morality, Michael McCrudden, and so much more.
1420240	1423720	I would love to hear what you think about it, because it is a very complex topic and
1423720	1428120	I know that we're not completely dealing with all the intricacies right here, right now.
1428120	1432180	However, hopefully it does stimulate some sort of discussion that we can take forward.
1432180	1436400	Hopefully it'll inspire people to draw a much clearer line on how they feel about these
1436400	1437400	topics.
1437400	1438400	Let me know down below.
1438400	1441920	I'd also like to thank my editors who once again have done a fantastic job, I'll leave
1441920	1444660	all their links in the pinned comment most likely.
1444660	1448900	Definitely check them out, I can't give them enough credit, they just do a great job every
1448900	1450540	single time.
1450540	1455380	Not too much else to say, if you want to reach me on Twitter, at The Right Pinion, Facebook,
1455380	1460260	Discord, links below, you can find me all there, I'm an accessible person and I do my
1460260	1461260	best to be.
1461260	1465380	However, until we reach that bridge, I'm The Right Pinion, and I'll see you in the next
1465380	1465880	one.
1471920	1473920	Thanks for watching, I'll see you in the next one.
