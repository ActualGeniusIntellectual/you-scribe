0	15320	Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the right opinion, the home of a twat with
15320	19020	too much free time, and family channels, they still haven't won me over quite yet.
19020	26320	Whether it's the ACE family's exploitation of influencer status, the store for false
26320	29760	enchantment surrounding adoption, or their former facade of faithfulness, there is a
29760	33480	sense that the presence of cameras can corrupt one's perception of what a family means,
33480	36700	and the honesty and values that would typically be shared behind closed doors.
36700	41040	The only value that such channels will offer is as a guide to parents, and soon to be parents,
41040	45520	who want to be the best they can be, sometimes as a template on how to practice parenting,
45520	47680	and sometimes as a template on how not to.
47680	50840	You'd still be within your rights to ask the question whether this trade-off is worth
50840	55040	it for the broadcast of what is a very personal attachment during formative years, and if
55040	58520	it would actually be more effective to seek guidance from professionals in the field.
58520	62120	But if family channels are here to stay, let's hope they can provide some instruction for
62120	64120	the next generation of parents.
64120	67600	The truth is though that most channels in this genre are disinterested in serving that
67600	71020	purpose, they're more there to entertain audience members, and although some may try
71020	74900	to defend certain videos as edutainment, a lot of modern family channels just take a
74900	78220	rather generic formula of content creation and add children.
78220	81320	With that said, there are exceptions to this rule, couples and channels who do promote
81320	85140	navigating challenges within their families, and either provide advice or insight into
85140	87000	how certain issues are resolved.
87000	91000	Of course, there is no one-size-fits-all manual on how to properly parent, and over the past
91000	94680	century the brailing wisdom on how best to instill clear morals and values into the youth
94680	98900	of today has evolved significantly, alongside our own morals and values, with many families
98900	102440	from all over the world moving towards more moderate blueprints on discipline from within
102440	103440	the family.
103440	106640	This has received broad support from pediatric psychologists, although it's still been
106640	110320	met with some resistance from people who feel that the traditional model worked on a practical
110320	114280	basis for them, and therefore there's no reason for why they should deviate from it.
114280	117860	With the opportunity for families from all backgrounds to broadcast themselves online,
117860	121260	you are inevitably going to experience a wide pool of parenting techniques, some of which
121260	126000	may lean towards the more traditional methods that resonate with the cohort of the population.
126000	129800	At the same time, traditional parenting is a system that has needed to evolve as well,
129800	133720	particularly given how aspects of that system, including physical reprimand, is now widely
133720	135560	reviled and considered outdated.
135560	138960	It's uncertain therefore whether it's more fitting or ironic that one of the most progressive
138960	143160	places to video share has become a bastion for people promoting more traditional parenting
143160	147000	styles, especially with the common narrative that today's youth are out of control.
147000	151060	The truth is, though, that ultimately, regardless of what an expert might say, everyone is always
151060	154320	going to have their own ideas of how to do something, and without the constraints of
154320	158280	network approval or peer reviews, parents are free to share their own techniques on
158280	159280	YouTube.
159280	161480	But what does the modern form of traditional parenting look like?
161480	165800	Well, for a few years towards the end of the 2010s, one individual thought she had it down
165800	167060	to a T.
167060	171400	So let's head on down to the wonderful state of Utah, to a mother of six and content creator
171400	172980	by the name of Ruby Franky.
180980	185060	Ruby Franky was the matriarch of the 8 Passengers YouTube channel, a channel which documented
185060	188180	the rearing of her six children alongside her husband Kevin.
188180	191780	This channel was launched in 2015 at a time where family channels were experiencing a
191780	194300	lot of popularity on the video sharing platform.
194420	198100	Although not becoming an overnight sensation, she steadily accrued over 2 million subscribers
198100	201980	in the coming years, and found herself becoming a guiding light for many aspiring parents
201980	204100	on the subject of how to raise children.
204100	207620	Her techniques stem from a more traditional perspective that focused on punitive measures
207620	210180	to teach her family the importance of responsibility.
210180	214120	Her family were part of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as
214120	217540	the Mormon Church, and although she didn't necessarily sing from the rooftops about it
217540	220780	in her content, her faith clearly played an influential role in her life.
220860	224340	Nevertheless, she was also a modern parent in how she promoted these techniques and explained
224340	228380	her thought process, appearing more methodical and philosophical in her reflections on her
228380	232460	actions, which her fans appeared to create some degree of understanding and respect,
232460	235900	enshrining her as a millennial model for the traditionally minded mother.
250780	256580	In spite of this, as her channel amplified its reach, she began to draw criticism for
256580	259920	the treatment of her children, which often involved measures that many felt were extremely
259920	261920	disproportionate to their actions.
261920	265720	These measures often resulted in a deprivation of aspects to one's life that many would consider
265720	269700	quite basic, and would widely be criticised as having an outwardly detrimental effect
269700	270700	on their development.
280780	291740	In spite of this, she would defend her parental technique due to its results, those being
291740	295860	the perceived respect that her children demonstrated towards her in content and how it had seemingly
295860	297980	resolved behavioural issues and challenges.
297980	302280	Ultimately, from her and her husband's perspective, this style was conducive to a happy family,
302280	304580	something they promoted on their channel to millions of viewers.
304580	309100	If you wanted an operational family life, then this was the way, but what happens in
309100	312140	front of the cameras is only ever a fragment of the full story.
312140	315940	Yes, in the years that followed the spotlight being placed on her parental techniques from
315940	320980	content creators, Ruby Franky's life began to implode quite spectacularly, with a disintegration
320980	325620	of nearly everything that she knew, culminating in 2023 with the deletion of her remaining
325620	329820	YouTube channels, alongside her arrest and detention, the judge deeming what she was
329820	332900	accused of as too severe to even be granted bail.
332900	337060	It seems that Ruby Franky didn't just possess a parental style, she was possessed by something
337060	342300	far more sinister, and today we will be delving into that, and the consequences of those
342300	343300	actions.
343300	347220	I'll add that given the legal sensitivity and potential victimization of individuals,
347220	350940	certain figures will be having their identities censored in this video, that information is
350940	353980	not relevant to what I'll be discussing today regardless.
353980	360100	So fellow internet friends and fiends, I suggest we examine the online remains of Ruby Franky,
360660	363220	which is exactly what was really going on.
371900	375940	On her YouTube channel, Ruby Franky was a mother, first and foremost.
375940	387020	My house right now is a combination of smells of banana peel, wet diaper, and garbages that
387940	393140	There was a fair bit more to her than initially met the eye.
393140	396700	First of all, she was part of a significant vlogging syndicate with her wider family,
396700	399780	all of whom had started somewhat successful channels themselves.
399780	403700	Ruby had posted a couple videos onto YouTube over a decade ago, mostly grainy videos of
403700	406860	her playing piano pieces, and an interesting upload about Chick-fil-A.
406860	429140	There was some other content as well, but these were presented at the time as standalone
429140	430140	uploads.
430140	433220	In her description, she states that this is because she was already a happy mother of
433220	434580	four wonderful children.
434580	438020	Her sister Ellie had launched a couples channel with her husband Jared, in part to document
438020	441380	their struggle of overcoming infertility, which was well received at the time.
441380	444640	In the following years, each of the Franky siblings launched their own channels, Ruby
444640	445940	being the last to do so.
445940	449920	In spite of being the oldest and seemingly having a stable family life by this point,
449920	453340	in an interview she gave approximately a year after beginning to upload on the video sharing
453340	456940	platform, her rationale appeared to reflect a perspective that she wanted to live in the
456940	457940	moment, stating,
464580	470740	The channel therefore to her stood to serve as an archive of those happy family memories
470740	474660	and milestones, something that you definitely received the impression of by watching a sample
474660	476200	platter of her content.
476200	480140	Now given the deletion of the 8 Passengers YouTube channel, we don't have a full catalogue
480140	483960	of content available to us, but I selected a few videos that would hopefully give me
483960	487620	and yourselves, if you choose, an insight into the family dynamics.
487620	490820	On the one hand, it wasn't hard to see why the woman of the house had accrued a following.
490820	494740	You guys, this is like a landmark in our family.
494740	496660	Getting rid of the car seats is one.
496660	497660	It's huge.
497660	498780	Getting rid of car seats is huge.
498780	499780	We're not quite there yet.
499780	501340	We're still in booster seats.
501340	503360	We're out of diapers.
503360	507080	You guys, none of my kids had training wheels.
507080	510140	Having children all at different stages in their life allowed her to show the diversity
510140	512300	of experiences the raising them presented.
512300	515760	It allowed her to demonstrate her abilities to navigate situations, while addressing her
515760	518060	own shortcomings as a mother occasionally.
518060	519940	The channel page would provide this impression.
519940	524560	One popular series of videos advertised was the Sorry, Not Sorry, So Sorry, which accepted
524560	529180	that in a family where no one is perfect, they all have to learn to say those two words.
529180	533500	In content itself, Ruby's demeanour often presents itself as calm but also firm.
533500	537100	You wouldn't necessarily receive an idea of her parental style from just randomly clicking
537100	538100	on a video.
538100	541540	She wasn't loud, she wasn't necessarily aggressive, she was obviously involved as
541540	545400	parents went, but it didn't necessarily purport itself as overbearing.
545400	549200	With that said, Ruby still had a narrative that she appeared to craft using her content,
549200	553160	often making loaded statements to her children to seek agreement and validation from them,
553160	556080	though not always specifically asking how they truly felt.
556080	559760	I was talking to Daddy about you last night, and you know what we said?
559760	560760	What?
560760	566080	How much we are just amazed by you and your love of learning.
566080	569480	You do it because you love to learn, don't you?
569480	572440	It's not about grades for you, is it?
572440	573440	It's all about...
573440	574440	Sort of?
574480	577400	You enjoy it, I can tell, I'm very proud of you.
577400	580680	It's clear that she wanted herself and her children to be perceived a certain way by
580680	584400	the audience, perhaps as a reflection on her own parenting abilities, something that was
584400	586720	always prone to public scrutiny as a content creator.
586720	591160	In a world of far more avaricious channels who exploited drama and conflict, Eight Passengers
591160	595420	often avoided conflict by simply choosing not to focus on those parts of their lives.
595420	599160	The reason that Ruby Frankie's sentiments often flew under the radar is because it was
599160	604300	not the centerpiece of her content, many unassuming viewers simply would not notice anything unreasonable
604300	608360	about her demeanor a majority of the time, and she would often seek to avoid publicizing
608360	609960	that side of her completely.
609960	613320	She laid down boundaries regarding what the child would document, stating that certain
613320	615980	conversations would be dealt with off-camera.
615980	617500	What do you think about it?
617500	620340	Well, we'll discuss it when we get home.
620340	621340	I know, yeah, I saw the text.
621340	624100	It's not something I want to discuss on the vlog.
624100	625100	Why?
626100	635900	Because it involves behaviour, attitude, and consequences, which we don't tend to vlog very much.
635900	640060	These often related to possible emotional challenges and disciplinary measures.
640060	643440	Ruby made the active decision to often keep these potentially sensitive discussions off
643440	647020	the channel, for some that would be a reasonable decision as the presence of a video camera
647020	651580	could very easily influence how two people interact, however it also might prompt a discerning
651580	655300	audience member to wonder exactly what those conversations entailed.
655300	659700	The glimpses we did receive into Ruby's message definitely appear to lean into austerity.
659700	663060	One such measure that jumped out was when one of her daughters went through a manicure
663060	667780	kit, making a mess on the floor and carpet, before hiding under the bed, likely out of
667780	668780	embarrassment.
668780	671980	Although visibly bothered, Ruby doesn't seem enraged, nonetheless, her punishment
671980	675860	of denying her nail painting services to said daughter for the following month would definitely
675860	679820	strike some parents as quite strict, especially as Ruby says that it's her daughter's
679820	680820	favourite activity.
680940	684340	However, the daughter seems to accept this, and there's no apparent bad blood on camera.
684340	689060	You're still going to have the consequence of not having your nails done for a month.
689060	691060	Do you understand that?
691060	692060	Yes.
692060	698780	And I still, I still want to buy you one of the another rugs.
698780	701980	You still want to buy me a new rug?
701980	704980	Maybe you can do some extra chores to help with the money.
704980	705980	Um, Mom.
705980	706980	It's a deal.
706980	707980	Give me a hug.
707980	708980	Um, Mom.
708980	712460	It appeared that Ruby valued accountability and consequence.
712460	715300	She wanted to make sure that her children were aware of these tenets, and she wasn't
715300	717300	the only person who appreciated that.
717300	721820	Yes, despite launching her channel after those of her sisters, by 2020, 8 Passengers was
721820	725140	the most subscribed channel out of Frankie's entire family.
725140	728700	Ruby's tough love model of parenting had resonated with a variety of people, and although
728700	732420	the punishment may strike some as harsh, there often wasn't a great level of discourse
732420	733420	on it.
733420	736680	The truth was that 8 Passengers harvested a strong view count with established sponsors
736680	738580	for a majority of their lifespan.
738580	747500	Um, 999,999, and then it jumped straight to a million and 5, and then 6, by the time
747500	752740	I got to look down it was like a million and 10, oh my gosh.
752740	757460	In spite of their success though, come 2020, the family channel heyday had mostly passed,
757460	761220	with a lot of 8 Passengers content only receiving a few hundred thousand views per video.
761220	764820	If anything, they'd survived the viral stage of their career, and were moving into a more
764820	768460	perhaps low-key era, where they would be able to focus on holding on to the law of
768460	771460	viewership and perhaps experimenting a little with content.
771460	775360	However, there are certainly limits to that experimentation, and although setting down
775360	779620	boundaries for what was enforced on and off camera, Ruby Franky was about to be a bit
779620	782340	too frank with her audience.
782340	783340	How would that happen?
783340	784340	Well.
797940	802100	There's an unpredictability about parenting, there are many ways that one can prepare to
802100	805100	raise a child, and help support them to be the best versions of themselves.
805100	809020	At the same time, there are always factors that one cannot control, be them outside the
809020	811940	parenting sphere, or be them within the child themselves.
811940	815620	Some people are not blessed with balanced chemicals within the brain, and that can cultivate
815620	817380	conflict during their development.
817380	821060	In the Franky family, this appeared to be the most conspicuous with their oldest son,
821060	824340	who although appearing rather mild-mannered throughout much of their content, was reported
824340	828580	by Ruby and Kevin to be experiencing some issues, which resulted in a suspension.
828580	831540	This incident appears to be alluded to in the earlier clip that I showed, where Ruby
831540	835260	stated that she felt this was not a discussion for the camera, however approximately half
835260	839500	a year after his suspension, Ruby's oldest son vanished from content on the channel altogether,
839500	843820	and although I doubt anyone assumed the worst, some people likely did ask some questions.
843820	847740	These questions would be answered at the end of 2019, where the Frankys go into more detail
847740	851660	surrounding their attempts to set their son on the right path, explaining over sentimental
851660	855340	acoustic music that they had decided to send him to a corrective course.
855340	861700	We debated whether we should talk to the viewers about what's been going on.
861700	868060	We wanted to do the right thing, so we got a lot of opinions from a lot of adults.
868060	870220	Who did this corrective course entail, exactly?
870220	874780	Well, it's our old friend, the Wilderness Camp, to be particular, the Anasazi Wilderness
874780	876300	Camp in Mesa, Arizona.
877500	886300	Today has just entered the Anasazi Foundation wilderness therapy program, where he's going
886300	895020	to spend the next eight to ten weeks living in the Anasazi desert, the desert mountains
895020	896020	of Arizona.
896180	899460	Now, I've already spoken in part about the concerns surrounding wilderness therapy in
899460	903940	my Dr Phil video, but generally I'm not an enthusiastic advocate for that form of treatment.
903940	908500	With that said, Anasazi is not Turnabout Ranch, and there are many issues related to Turnabout
908500	912500	Ranch that were independent from the concerns relating to wilderness therapy as a whole.
912500	916340	Although Kevin and Ruby are more revealing than they may usually be in this video, they
916340	920100	also still refrain from indulging details regarding their son's behaviour, stating that
920100	922260	it's been an ongoing issue outside the channel.
922980	929220	It's an accumulation of things over years, well before we ever started YouTubing, or
929220	936100	well before we ever got into social media, and it's reached a point where he needs to
936100	942180	develop some very basic maturity and skills that he's going to need as an adult.
942180	945700	One can't help but wonder whether if this was a problem before the issue channel, then
945700	949300	they should have been addressed before setting up a media account on a public platform, but
949380	952420	if that's how they decide to go about it, then so be it.
952420	956020	Although this upload likely drew skepticism from individuals who felt these camps were
956020	959940	detrimental, the Frankie's had already made up their mind, and despite hesitancy to talk
959940	963380	about it at first, over the coming months they continue to report on their son's progress
963380	966420	favourably, pulling some of the highest view counts of the year for their channel.
966420	970500	Their son returns home to a fanfare from his family, and in the coming months is heralded
970500	971780	as a resounding success.
979300	985700	It seems that wilderness therapy had worked this time, and Ruby's son was on his way
985700	988020	to becoming an upstanding citizen of society.
988020	991700	The next half year passed without a major family incident, they moved house, and formed
991700	996180	a united family front during the first cold months of the coronavirus pandemic, even chronicling
996180	998980	their response to the 2020 Salt Lake City earthquake.
998980	1003140	It was safe to say there wasn't a scarcity in subjects and experiences to cover.
1003140	1007460	At the same time, having all the children home at once was obviously a great responsibility
1007460	1011460	on anyone, and many of those youngsters who were used to actually going outside on a regular
1011460	1016340	basis found the restrictions to cause a great restlessness, and restlessness can beget acting
1016340	1020740	out, and in one video at the end of May entitled What We Haven't Told You, Ruby reveals that
1020740	1025140	while herself and her husband were away at a retreat, the rules they set regarding allocated
1025140	1028020	use of technology had been breached by two family members.
1028020	1031940	She was obviously not thrilled by this information, and decided to be more vocal than usual on
1031940	1035780	the punishment that she deemed appropriate for these shenanigans, stating that electronic
1035780	1039060	items in the house would be banned for the coming summer, though this doesn't really
1039060	1041380	have to do with what they didn't tell us, does it?
1041380	1045700	Well, let's reintroduce her oldest son, who Ruby encourages to share his own personal
1045700	1049780	experience with the punitive measures imposed by his mother, which included the confiscation
1049780	1051620	of his electronic items as well.
1051620	1056420	Ruby- Every day I would wake up around 5am, and I would go and do my daily thinking in
1056420	1062340	front of that safe full of all my electronics, like the Xbox, and the iPads, and all the
1062340	1069700	iPhones, and the laptops, and the TV remotes, you even locked up the TV remotes, because
1069700	1071380	you locked them up for the entire summer.
1071380	1075060	We assume that this refers back to his past behavioural issues, and although some would
1075060	1078820	deem it rather strict, some would still argue that many of these devices are not items they
1078820	1082740	were necessarily entitled to, he at least still had the opportunity to hang out with
1082740	1084580	his friends and socialise in other ways.
1084580	1088180	This was already more information than many viewers were privy to usually, but the video
1088180	1092500	then takes a stranger turn with Ruby herself as the parent asking her son if he thinks
1092500	1094340	that she should confiscate the TV.
1094340	1098660	He responds saying that he was under the impression that she was doing so already, with Ruby's
1098660	1101460	response to be accusing him of quote, telling stories.
1101460	1103620	Ruby- You think you're reading my mind, and I'm-
1103620	1105540	Ruby- That's a story?
1106580	1107460	Storytelling?
1107700	1109380	Okay, fine, then take away TV from me.
1110900	1112820	Is that what you would suggest?
1112820	1117780	Sure, unless it's like a family movie, because I see him all the time watching Netflix.
1117780	1122260	Her son eventually concedes and says that he thinks it's a good idea, and although I'm
1122260	1127140	in favour of more democracy, it seems a very intriguing time to shirk one's parental responsibility.
1127140	1130900	We then cut to her divulging more information about how she confiscated her daughter's
1130900	1134340	phone, and what those punishments represented to her as a parent.
1134340	1140580	So, in our house, we, when we take something away, it's because they have shown that they
1140580	1143540	are not responsible enough to manage it.
1143540	1147220	Although none of her diatribe felt completely unfathomable, her narratives were beginning
1147220	1151700	to feel a little defensive and unnecessary, with strange rules that I'm not even sure
1151700	1153860	anyone knew existed until this video.
1153860	1159140	It has to be consistent over a minimum, minimum of six months, and that-
1159140	1164740	One of the consequences is she will not be getting her nails painted for a solid month.
1164740	1168820	It was clear that this conversation was moving into new territory, but few could have been
1168820	1171460	prepared for the bombshell that was about to be dropped.
1171460	1173780	I don't think our viewers know that.
1173780	1175140	Not even Ruby.
1185540	1188900	Up to this point, you could easily question Ruby's disciplinary decisions,
1188900	1192580	but there was no catalyst for the sort of public attention that such methods could draw.
1192580	1196340	However, when discussing this six-month rule, her oldest son reveals that he had been without
1196340	1198420	a bed for a full seven months.
1199140	1203300	My bedroom was taken away for seven months, and then you give it back like a couple weeks ago.
1203300	1204660	I've been sleeping on a beanbag.
1204660	1209540	I've been sleeping on a beanbag since October, and they gave me my broom back like two weeks ago.
1209540	1210740	What was the reason for this?
1210740	1215220	That I woke up at two in the morning and told him that we're going to Disneyland and he
1215220	1219620	has to pack, and he got up and made his bed all neatly and then packed all his clothes
1219620	1223700	in the suitcase, and then he walked out the door and he's like, why?
1223700	1228740	And he's all happy, has his sunglasses on, and I was like, we're not going to Disneyland.
1228740	1231860	Well, it appears that the oldest son played a prank on his younger brother,
1231860	1235780	waking up at an ungodly hour and telling him that they were going to Disneyland, when in fact,
1235780	1236580	they were not.
1236580	1240740	This inevitably led to a lot of disappointment, and does seem like a rather cruel joke.
1240740	1244660	Ruby clarifies, though, that this was not the only issue, more so a final straw as he admits
1244660	1246980	he had been tormenting his sibling in other ways as well,
1246980	1249460	including on the day that he came back from wilderness therapy.
1249460	1254260	Ruby- When he began at his face and hung him on the basketball.
1258580	1261060	Ruby- Basically, basically...
1261060	1263300	Ruby- The day I got home, too.
1264180	1268020	However, although you could argue that demonstrated a potential issue in sharing a bedroom with a
1268020	1272340	sibling, few could see how forcing the son to sleep on a beanbag for seven months was a
1272340	1274900	just and proportionate punishment for such hijinks.
1274900	1277300	If you believe that two people can't share a bedroom between them,
1277300	1281540	then you need to take adequate measures to ensure that each party at least has a bed available.
1281540	1284500	Ruby's point isn't aided when it's revealed that since moving house,
1284500	1286580	they've actually had a whole bedroom available,
1286580	1290420	they just didn't allow their son to move into it due to the past incidents.
1290420	1294180	Outside of these details, Ruby's own response was somewhat indicative as well,
1294180	1297940	forcing out a nervous chuckle while observing that this was new information to the audience.
1297940	1300980	It would be easy to cut the recording here and edit out this discussion,
1300980	1302900	like I'm sure she had many times before.
1302900	1304900	But after her son had explained the predicament,
1304900	1307540	she decides that actually there was a point to be made.
1307540	1308980	What would her explanation be?
1308980	1314900	Ruby- Showed that he was not able to manage himself sharing a bedroom with...
1314900	1321380	Chad- So when we moved, um, the bigger room in the basement was automatically his,
1321380	1322500	and I didn't have a room.
1322500	1327620	Ruby- So a lot of you are like, hey, that's not fair because got the bigger,
1327620	1330260	the lesser bedroom and got the bigger bedroom.
1330340	1332100	Chad- The smaller bedroom.
1332100	1337780	Ruby- Got the big bedroom and got the smaller bedroom and the bigger bedroom also had a bathroom.
1337780	1341540	But what you guys didn't know was you didn't get any room.
1341540	1343380	Well, honestly, not really much.
1343380	1347700	Once again, it seems more like a problem of coexistence rather than a problem of having
1347700	1351380	a bedroom. In a way, sometimes giving people a private space would be more helpful than
1351380	1352420	depriving them of it.
1352420	1356180	Although it feels like none of those in the video feel the punishment was proportionate,
1356180	1360180	even spending a fair amount of time laughing about the incidents, they still accept it.
1360660	1364180	The video only becomes more depressing by the minute, with both the kids she was filming
1364180	1367460	with stating that they have no friends at all, so they can't even hang out with them
1367460	1368260	for the summer.
1368260	1372260	Although Ruby expresses some form of sympathy, she doesn't seem particularly motivated to
1372260	1376100	do much about it, more just thinking about how it's perceived by the viewers.
1376100	1376980	Ruby- You can play with friends.
1376980	1378420	Chad- No, like I don't have friends.
1378420	1379380	Ruby- I don't have friends either.
1379380	1382420	Chad- I literally like told my friends I'm not hanging out with them anymore.
1382420	1383300	Ruby- See, because they're-
1383300	1385220	Chad- They say some pretty messed up stuff.
1385220	1388100	Ruby- How do you feel about not having any friends?
1388900	1395540	Chad- Sucks, but I don't feel safe or accepted in any friend group, so.
1395540	1400980	Ruby- That's really vulnerable of you to say that on camera, because you don't have to
1400980	1401700	film that.
1401700	1403860	No Ruby, you do not have to film that.
1404740	1406260	And yet, you did.
1406260	1410100	Still amongst this all, Ruby takes the time to make sure everyone knows how hard it's
1410100	1413780	been on her, though I'm not sure her son was completely buying it.
1414260	1419860	Look, when you make these choices with your family to take things away as a parent, you
1419860	1425300	really do want them to have these things, and it's been so, so, so difficult to take
1425300	1430900	a phone away, to take a bedroom away, to take iPads away, to take access away.
1430900	1436180	Like, it hurts me just as much as it hurts my kids.
1436180	1440020	Although the video finishes on a somewhat lighter note with Ruby finding some middle
1440020	1443700	ground with her younger son, people had already seen enough and began to call her out for
1443700	1446020	depriving her son of a bedroom and a bed.
1446020	1450260	This began on social media, with some using the clip and letting Ruby and Kevin know that
1450260	1453540	they were not happy, that Frankie seemed to be aware of this negative response because
1453540	1456340	the video was deleted within the first couple days following upload.
1456340	1460500	However, as people began to re-upload it and comments were able to be left below, it became
1460500	1465220	clear how many were not simply going to let this slide, with content creators soon providing
1465220	1466580	their input as well.
1466580	1473060	The video is titled, What We Haven't Told You, and in this video, her eldest son details
1473140	1479780	that he has not been sleeping in a bed, let alone a bedroom, in the past seven months.
1479780	1484500	But I just feel like as a punishment for pranking his brother should have just been like him
1484500	1489700	hanging out with his brother more, but, you know, this is an extreme form of parenting
1489700	1490100	here.
1490100	1494500	When a clip like this goes viral, many look towards the rest of a creator's body of content
1494500	1498420	to see if there were any other incidents that could signify a clear pattern of behaviour,
1498420	1502580	and like clockwork they did, with many netizens unearthing older video excerpts where they
1502580	1504900	felt she had gone too far in her parental approach.
1504900	1508820	Outside of publishing very revealing details and moments that many felt breached their
1508820	1512900	individual privacy, clips of her disciplinary measures included threatening to forfeit her
1512900	1516740	son's dinners if they continued play fighting, even though it was quite apparent it was in
1516740	1520900	jest, refusing to supply her six-year-old daughter with any additional sustenance after
1520900	1524660	she forgot to make herself lunch, threatening to behead her daughter's fluffy toy as she
1524660	1528580	continued to act out with these scissors, and this one where she's in her best Miranda
1528580	1529460	Sings cosplay.
1538900	1543540	Those few clips in particular picked up traction because they just seemed unnecessarily harsh
1543540	1544980	without any real motive.
1544980	1549620	People forget things, people muck around, especially when they're young, Ruby was and
1549620	1552980	is no exception, and to preach that a six-year-old needs to go hungry or else she won't learn
1552980	1556900	to make her own lunch is just an unreasonably cynical perspective, especially given that
1556900	1559540	as far as we know it was the first time that this had occurred.
1559540	1563460	When you put all of the incriminating clips together, they create a pretty damning portrait
1563460	1567380	of the sort of household that Ruby Franky was operating, and many felt at that point
1567380	1571380	she was already unfit to be a parent, with an individual launching a change.org petition
1571380	1575780	to have CPS investigate the parents, and to ensure the safety of all those involved.
1576340	1580580	This was escalating very quickly, with many clips painting the parents in a very unflattering
1580580	1584420	light, however there were always two sides to the story, and the Frankys were gearing
1584420	1585540	up to present their own.
1586340	1587540	What would they say?
1587540	1592340	Ruby Franky-"I'm going to do a video and post it tomorrow, but I think I'm just gonna do it right now."
1599300	1603700	As noted, in spite of their content not exactly inviting people to make their voices heard,
1603700	1607940	the Frankys were extremely sensitive to audience response, and removed their upload nearly as soon
1607940	1612260	as they began to sense negative feedback, very shortly after Ruby took to Instagram Stories
1612260	1614260	to address the criticism directed at her.
1614260	1619300	Ruby Franky-"I'm going to, um, I'm gonna post tomorrow. I don't normally post on Saturdays,
1620420	1626820	and I would love to validate all of your anger, and to let you know that I hear you,
1627540	1630900	and I understand why you're upset."
1631540	1635060	The first clip onto her Instagram acknowledges the feedback, and commits to responding the
1635060	1639060	following day. It's slightly hard to interpret how she feels about it, although she is vocal
1639060	1643220	in stating that the people expressing their concern are heard. Her tone is marked by an
1643220	1647060	undercurrent of disdain, particularly when referencing people who have sent her messages,
1647060	1648900	many of which she claims are supportive.
1649780	1653860	Ruby Franky-"It's always so interesting when things go black and white.
1653860	1658100	Not everything goes black and white, but every once in a while there's a post where
1658980	1665620	you either really hate what you've heard, and that's usually what fills up in the comments,
1665620	1671140	and then it's in the DMs where people don't want to be attacked for giving support,
1671140	1680260	which I totally get, but I've gotten a lot of support in the DMs, so for that, I thank you."
1680900	1684660	However, six hours later, with the situation clearly ballooning online, Ruby changed her
1684660	1688820	mind and decides to tackle it once more on her Instagram story, appearing in the car with her
1688820	1692900	husband Kevin, for a ten minute statement which explains the rationale behind her controversial
1692900	1699220	upload. Ruby Franky-"I didn't anticipate all the upset, however, listening to all of your comments
1699220	1706820	and your feedback and your feelings around things, it totally makes sense to me why you're
1706820	1711460	angry and why you're upset." She explains that she was surprised that the son has spoken about all
1711460	1715780	the quote outcomes of his behaviour, and had repeatedly reassured him that she was happy to
1715780	1720340	cut it from the upload, an offer which her son declined, stating that this should be uploaded.
1720340	1724180	However, in hindsight, she can see why the content was upsetting for certain viewers.
1724180	1727620	This is where Kevin chimes in, expressing sympathy towards the viewer's perspective,
1727620	1730900	but also going into detail about their son's background, and why they felt,
1730900	1735220	after consultation with professionals, the sanction imposed on their son was justified.
1735220	1740260	Kevin-"Long before we started YouTube, there were a lot of behavioural and emotional challenges that
1740260	1745540	we were dealing with with our kids, and we've been consulting with mental health and emotional
1745540	1752420	health professionals for years. And the things that we show and share, and the things that
1752420	1758500	many of you are criticizing and calling abusive, are actually things that mental health professionals
1758500	1764100	have counseled us to do." There are pudiate claims that this sort of treatment could ever be labelled
1764100	1767540	as abuse, with Ruby stating that although she would agree that parents who deprived their
1767540	1771860	children of beds could be classified as such, she hasn't done this for fun, from her perspective,
1771860	1775140	this was a warranted forfeiture, and that was something that had also been enforced at the
1775140	1779300	Anasazi camp. This was all in line with her parenting style, and she wasn't fazed by the
1779300	1783700	accusations as she'd experienced them before, and considers those accusing her this time as
1783700	1789540	uninformed as any of those prior detractors. Ruby-"We got accused of child abuse when we sent
1789540	1798180	to Anasazi. Guess what? The first thing that they did was take a bed away. They don't have beds,
1799140	1805300	so slept on the hard ground for months, and it's, you know, it's run by psychologists and therapists,
1806020	1812980	and if not having a bed was psychologically damaging, then they wouldn't have suggested that."
1812980	1816180	She states that the bottom line is this is how they parent. They receive a lot of comments
1816180	1820100	wondering how their children are so well behaved, and the results are there on the YouTube channel
1820100	1824180	for anyone to actually see. Kevin and Ruby then accuse many of those criticizing them for
1824180	1829140	projecting their own experiences onto them. Ruby-"And so if you are triggered, and you're upset
1829140	1836660	because of something Kevin and I have done with our children that is actually working really well
1837300	1845860	for us, then I would invite you to look at it and ask yourself what is it that I'm projecting
1845860	1851700	onto this situation, because you would be upset, and you would be angry if I was your mom doing
1851700	1856420	this to you." The next five minutes are a mix of dollar store psychoanalysis of those attacking
1856420	1859860	them, and a variety of further disorganized thoughts on the matter. I don't really have
1859860	1863540	too much to add here, it should be clear by now that their line of response was to acknowledge
1863540	1867140	those who may be concerned, and attempt to show that they were listening, but also dismiss
1867140	1870900	accusations implying that people were not adequately informed or familiar with the relevant
1870900	1874820	context to actually appreciate these methods of parenting. This response was not received well,
1874820	1878420	with many feeling that the Frankies were trying to shift the responsibility of interpreting the
1878420	1882900	situation onto anyone but themselves. Paired with the unravelling allegations regarding other clips
1882900	1886420	they had posted on their channel, they decided to continue uploading content while ignoring
1886420	1890180	the criticism. One of their next uploads though was announcing their son's new room,
1890180	1893940	this was to be expected as they had done this before for other siblings, but it wasn't really
1893940	1897300	a good time to post this, and although people couldn't voice their thoughts as the comments
1897300	1901060	were turned off, the like to dislike ratio reflected a still present eye towards the
1901060	1905620	embattled family channel. However, in spite of the criticism, no platform seemed inclined to act in
1905620	1909460	the moment, the petition ultimately went nowhere, and although it was reported they had received a
1909460	1913940	visit from CPS, this case was also closed pretty quickly. In the weeks after granting their son a
1913940	1918660	new bedroom, and with the storm clouds on their way out, the Frankies began to fight back finally,
1918660	1922740	firstly issuing cease and desist letters to many YouTubers who had in their opinion posted
1922740	1927460	defamatory content. Further this, they issued one more response to the media website, Insider,
1927460	1932420	though not entirely unopposed, the title framing these YouTubers as speaking out is certainly an
1932420	1937060	interesting choice. The article briefly recapped the situation before going over the perspective
1937060	1941380	of how many felt this punishment was harsh, and even drafting in multiple psychological experts
1941380	1946180	to explain how harsh punishments affect the mental development of youngsters, even having one explain
1946180	1950420	why seizing a bed would be extremely upsetting, seemingly setting up some quite strong criticism
1950420	1954980	of the Frankies. They respond however by stating that they actually never chose to forfeit their
1954980	1959220	son a bed, they gave him a choice on the matter, and that he was offered a guest bed and an
1959220	1963620	inflatable mattress as well, they were just separating the siblings as recommended by their
1963620	1967460	own psychologists. Ruby insists that they are teaching their children to be self-governing,
1967460	1971620	and that their son chose the bean bag because it was the most comfortable to him, and in spite of
1971620	1975780	her previously stated six-month rule, her son could have actually had the new bedroom at any
1975780	1980340	point his behaviour changed, it just happened to take seven months for him to make that choice.
1980340	1986180	And so we don't just turn around and give it back as soon as they start acting good.
1986180	1987620	It has to be consistent.
1987620	1994820	It has to be consistent over a minimum of six months, and that's showing up consistent in
1994820	1996820	every aspect of their life.
1996820	2000820	This response doesn't appear any more honest than the others, as a matter of fact there are many
2000820	2005220	details that don't seem to add up at all or line up to her previous narratives, even ones spoken
2005220	2009540	about in previous videos. The Frankies conclude by stating that the story is his to tell if he
2009540	2014180	chooses to, and with that they draw a line under the situation and all points of view surrounding
2014180	2017300	it. They say that they are proud of how their kids have handled it, and there are passionate
2017300	2021220	defences of their parents, including their daughter who posted on her Instagram in a message
2021220	2024900	which doesn't sound remotely like anything her elders would say, and the son in a wonderful
2024900	2029140	place right now, with a good group of friends and a healthy outlook on life where he holds high
2029140	2034180	standards and high boundaries. It seems that this challenge had only made their bond as a family
2034180	2038980	stronger, there was nothing that these malicious online trolls could say which could ever hold them
2038980	2040500	back, was there?
2044180	2052420	In the insider interview, the Frankies also provide their input on one more clip, the one where
2052420	2055620	Ruby refuses to give her daughter lunch after she had forgotten it.
2055620	2061220	Ruby- And hopefully, hopefully nobody gives her food and nobody steps in and gives her a lunch.
2061220	2065860	Once again they state there is missing context, and in fact Ruby had a lot of sympathy, but ultimately
2065860	2070980	they were so near the end of the day and that it was a one and a half hour round trip etc etc etc,
2070980	2075860	and maybe there is the distant possibility that this is true, but it's just not how it came across.
2075860	2081460	Ruby- She was responsible for making her lunches in the morning and she actually told me she did
2081460	2086180	pack a lunch, so the natural outcome is she's just going to need to be hungry,
2087620	2093540	and hopefully, hopefully nobody gives her food and nobody steps in and gives her a lunch.
2093540	2097300	There almost certainly is missing context because it's a clip from a YouTube video,
2097380	2101380	but this additional context provided by the parents doesn't really undermine the simple
2101380	2106100	observation that you sat in the car and chose to say that you hope nobody gives her food to
2106100	2109780	teach her a lesson. The Frankies' responses in the article appear to attempt to present their
2109780	2113380	parental style in a different light than their own content does, and given that they're the
2113380	2117140	ones who choose to upload those videos in the first place, it wasn't particularly convincing
2117140	2121620	as backtracking goes. If any of the people who advocate over this style of parenting read these
2121620	2126340	articles, they probably would have found it weak, and many of her critics were still not convinced.
2126340	2131220	On one hand, by the end of June 2020, the outrage over their parental conduct had mostly passed,
2131220	2134900	and a large majority of the Frankies' critics were not necessarily followers of the Eight
2134900	2139060	Passengers YouTube channel, so their investment or lack of shouldn't have influenced the ability
2139060	2143380	to upload successful content. Nevertheless, the family responses hadn't really instilled
2143380	2147380	confidence in viewers either. For people who had casually viewed her content and not necessarily
2147380	2151700	noticed these parental strategies until they were pointed out, Ruby and Kevin's responses weren't
2151700	2155700	convincing. The simple fact was that whether a psychologist recommended that her two sons
2155700	2159940	be separated doesn't negate the information they still actively chose to leave an available
2159940	2164900	bedroom empty after moving house, something that I do wonder how psychologists would feel about.
2164900	2168420	However, if you were a fan of the Eight Passengers YouTube channel and actually found their parental
2168420	2172420	style to be appealing to you, you probably don't like their moving the goalposts either,
2172420	2176100	because it seems to imply that they've actually been leaving information out of their videos
2176100	2179700	to make their parental style look stricter than it is, which for a YouTube channel that
2179700	2183940	occasionally presents themselves as an authority on parenting is a betrayal of sorts.
2184740	2190820	Austin! What are you... What are you... What's going through your head?
2194420	2195060	Oh my god!
2201700	2205940	A lot of family channels on YouTube managed to maintain an audience despite being pretty awful
2205940	2210820	because they don't necessarily set up the pretense that they possess any actual wisdom on parenting.
2210820	2214580	As I said at the start, people watch them for entertainment, and therefore when they publish
2214580	2219060	controversial or provocative content, their core viewership isn't necessarily switched off by it,
2219060	2223620	even if others do call them out. With the Eight Passengers channel, Ruby always attempted to find
2223620	2227540	some form of moral foundation to underpin the content with, to turn around and say,
2227540	2231780	well that isn't the entire story, even if it's in the form of defending yourself is going to
2231780	2235940	disillusion at least some of those who had formerly found value in what you created. The truth was
2235940	2240260	that although the anger from external sources had mostly passed, there was a degree of distrust that
2240260	2244740	lingered amongst viewership. When the situation initially broke, Eight Passengers lost a fair few
2244740	2248820	subscribers, and if they successfully vindicated themselves amongst those viewers, they would have
2248820	2253060	returned. A check of Social Blade would tell you that that did not happen, as a matter of fact,
2253060	2257940	quite the opposite. I can't believe this is how freeze-dried gummy bears look. I feel like I did
2257940	2264260	something wrong. Look at this, those are really good. Those are really good. Eight Passengers
2264260	2268980	continued to upload over the remainder of 2020, and for the extent of 2021 as well. Not too much
2268980	2273140	was said about them online, and going over their content in this time, it was noticeably milder,
2273140	2277620	with nearly a complete avoidance of confrontation altogether. It was very apparent that their brush
2277620	2281300	with their critics had steered them completely clear of addressing disciplinary issues in their
2281300	2286180	family, and they wanted to rebuild their image, although they were integrating some more curious
2286180	2291700	language. I don't know how to write a book, and then when I wrote the book, I learned new things,
2291700	2295540	and I went back and I saw all of the distortion that was in my first book, and I thought,
2295620	2299220	this can't be right. Interesting way to use the word distortion, but
2299220	2304100	I digress. Obviously, people still felt the way they did, but even amongst declining viewership,
2304100	2308020	the words of what they said at the end of the Insider article still rang true. What mattered
2308020	2312260	is that they were a healthy, happy family first, and although they had been shaken by the drama,
2312260	2316420	they must have seen the bright side of it, right? Well, there was one more article published in the
2316420	2319940	aftermath of their run-in with the internet. Published by The Ramp, this think piece once
2319940	2323700	more reflects where the Ruby and Kevin's own punishment was justified for how they were
2323700	2327860	portrayed. I don't really care too much for what The Ramp says in this article, but it certainly
2327860	2332100	provides an interesting insight into where the Frankie's were now. Over a year on, still
2332100	2336020	ruined the legacy of a situation that lasted a couple weeks, talking about the mob and the
2336020	2340260	sponsors they lost due to it. There's a real element of despondency in the tone of the Frankie's
2340260	2344020	throughout the article, they have not moved on. Despite being a channel with approximately 1
2344020	2348500	billion views from content, an extensive catalogue that many people frequently return to, despite
2348500	2353380	surviving the slew of criticism and still scoring at least 100,000 views a day on most days,
2353380	2357940	it was not enough. As a family channel, what you're providing is, in essence, a slice of life
2357940	2362020	content, you're documenting things that in many households would occur naturally. This doesn't
2362020	2366180	mean that YouTube is any less of a job for those people, but there's a purported sincerity that
2366180	2370820	this is what you love, and you would still do it the same way even if the cameras were off.
2370820	2374980	Ruby's husband, Kevin, still had a well-paying job as far as we knew, the YouTube channel was
2374980	2378900	a wonderful bonus, and in videos, Ruby didn't present it any other way.
2379060	2385220	Cooking in the kitchen when my kids were little was not very fun. I hated it because it was always
2385220	2389700	messier and it took longer than it really needed to, but what we really like to do now is cook
2389700	2396500	together, we're constantly making food together. I think we pretty much live in this room constantly.
2396500	2399940	I'm going to be blunt here, but there was something about how they speak in this interview
2399940	2403940	which provides the impression that they care more about the content than they do their own family.
2403940	2407540	The fact of the matter is that both sides had the chance to present their perspectives,
2407540	2411460	and as Ruby and Kevin noted themselves, most of these critics were not frequent viewers of
2411460	2415220	the channel. Unfortunately, their response wasn't convincing enough for some who were,
2415220	2419140	and they couldn't recoup that, and in spite of the fact that they still actually retained a lot,
2419140	2423460	they felt more comfortable lamenting what they could've had, rather than what was in front of
2423460	2434660	them. They still had their family, right? Well. There's often justified reason to question the
2434660	2438580	authenticity of YouTube couples. When you build a life around that, there's a pressure that you
2438580	2442420	must stay together for your image, for their perception of you. When that becomes intertwined
2442420	2445940	with your business, it can cause a lot of complications. I'd say the same could be said
2445940	2450100	about family channels. By this point, it was apparent that people weren't receiving the full
2450100	2454180	picture of what was truly going on inside the Frankie household. Although they had since mostly
2454180	2458340	avoided discussing discipline on their channel, they still defended their actions when asked,
2458340	2462820	which to many would imply that this reality they were creating for the camera was more manufactured
2462820	2466740	than ever. Their statements to the rap reinforced this, if you're not happy with the channel where
2466740	2471380	you post your life, the memories of you and your family, then how can you truly be happy with that
2471380	2476340	life either? And at the start of 2022, the 8 Passengers YouTube channel posted its last video
2476340	2480820	before falling inactive. Maybe they'd finally realised how detrimental this environment was
2480820	2485140	to those they loved, and took steps to remove themselves from that so they could heal properly,
2485140	2489540	or maybe they were just investing their energy into something else. So with that in mind,
2489540	2492820	let's introduce a supporting character to this lovely tale.
2492820	2499620	If you're like me, you've had pain in your life. It could be from a divorce, work conflicts,
2499620	2506820	relationship issues with children, grandchildren, spouse anxiety, depression, or fear that you don't
2506820	2512820	understand, feelings that you're not enough, or that you're unlovable. Connections is the solution.
2512820	2517940	This is Jodie Hildebrandt. She is a founder of self-help company Connections. With over two decades
2517940	2521700	experience in the psychotherapy world, at a passing glance she may not strike you as anyone
2521700	2526340	out of the ordinary. However, her background does deviate a little from that of the usual therapist.
2526340	2530740	She completed a graduate work in educational psychology, and registered as a licensed counselor
2530740	2534900	in Utah with Cirque Lodge, a rehabilitation clinic for people struggling with addiction.
2534900	2538660	However, she left the profession not too long after joining, expressing dissolution of the
2538660	2543620	welfare of her patients. In her own words, they were not healing. So she decided to set up her
2543620	2548580	own organization, with a goal to empower people, helping patients harness the truth, and avoiding
2548580	2553060	the treacherous distortions that manifest themselves in our lives. This assistance takes
2553060	2557860	the form of paid courses that you can access online or in person. Although in many ways it
2557860	2561540	doesn't appear the most threatening, there is certainly a language choice that would strike
2561540	2566820	readers as somewhat cultish, and further reading wouldn't inspire too much hope either. Hildebrandt
2566820	2571700	herself had been subject to a period of probation in 2012 after breaching patient confidentiality
2571700	2576820	multiple times by revealing information about her patients to other counselors, church clergy,
2576820	2581780	and even a local university, all of which without their consent. Although she successfully regained
2581780	2586340	her license and resumed her practice, when you pair it with her present-day ventures, you wouldn't be
2586340	2591300	wrong to exercise some caution. Nevertheless, that didn't stop people from signing up.
2591300	2597220	A couple of those people being Kevin and Ruby Frankie. Kevin- And some of these parenting-isms, these
2597220	2604180	cultural-isms that have contaminated parenting are things like beliefs that, it's my job to make
2604180	2609060	my kids happy. Hildebrandt- Give them a magical childhood. Kevin- It's my job to give my child
2609060	2616900	a magical childhood. It's my job to make my children smile and laugh. It's my job to make
2616900	2625140	my children successful. It's my job to prevent my children from having pain, right? All of these,
2625140	2630260	they all come from the same place, and it all comes from this belief, this distorted belief,
2630900	2638340	that I can measure my worth as an individual by how I parent. The Frankie family's first public
2638340	2642260	association with connections came via announcement on their Instagram page, where they were proclaimed
2642260	2645860	as panel members at an upcoming couples conference. However, one can assume that they were
2645860	2649220	likely involved in the business before then, especially given that they had previously
2649220	2653140	traveled to Europe with Paige Hanna, another creator who was previously affiliated with the
2653140	2657460	business. They appeared to have started counseling towards the end of 2020 due to videos posted on
2657460	2661460	connections' Facebook accounts. In spite of this, it seems that the controversy is what pushed them
2661460	2665380	to be more vocally involved, possibly seeking reinforcement for their own beliefs, and in the
2665380	2669460	coming couple years they were featured more and more promptly on the website and accompanying
2669460	2673540	social media, with a favor even being returned on the 8 Passengers YouTube channel. Hildebrandt- One
2673540	2678740	resource that I really like for mental health is connectionsclassroom.com. I will have the
2678740	2683060	connections classroom website down in the description box below, and you can also follow
2683060	2687940	them on Instagram over at connections coaching. Ruby in particular seemed to be devoting significant
2687940	2692180	portions of her personal time to associating with connections, and with the YouTube channel firmly
2692180	2696740	in the rearview mirror, she began to take this venture rather seriously, if not a little too
2696740	2701540	seriously. The first casualty of her new commitment was the 8 Passengers Instagram account. In the past,
2701540	2705700	this had been a supplement to the YouTube channel, where she had shared many of her fondest memories,
2705700	2710820	but on the 28th of June a new post was uploaded, a series of images overloaded with circles,
2710820	2715380	underlining, and various words capitalized, alongside a text post rambling about what the
2715380	2720180	principles are. Next to a litany of hashtags at the bottom were the messages of honesty,
2720180	2725140	responsibility, and humility, words we'd seen before, but this time it was Ruby Frankie who
2725140	2730020	was promulgating them. Around this time the 8 Passengers Instagram account rebranded to
2730020	2734820	Moms of Truth, with it becoming an account dedicated to Jodie and Ruby's thoughts
2734820	2738420	and teachings. It was almost somewhat scary how disposable all the previous
2738420	2741940	family content was to her, but she had clearly found a new calling.
2741940	2751220	Truth is love. Truth creates. Truth gives inspiration. Distortion deceives. Distortion
2751220	2760340	destroys. Distortion attacks. Distortion looks for proof. Distortion points the finger. Distortion
2760340	2764820	blames. In the following months, the post did not let up, with Ruby using this platform to promote
2764820	2768980	various pieces of doctrine. Although it received positive feedback from supporters, many followers
2768980	2773140	of the previous 8 Passengers Instagram account seemed confused, and even concerned about the
2773140	2777380	language she was using in these video posts, utilizing anecdotes and analogies to speak
2777380	2782900	very cryptically about parenting. Truth is not aggressive. Truth stands alone. Truth doesn't
2782900	2789140	need to be proved. Truth just is. It's like the sun, the sun doesn't have to get allies to come
2789140	2795220	around it and give it validation that it exists. It just exists. It doesn't need anybody to point
2795220	2799700	it out. It's just there. It seems, though, that this wasn't just having a negative effect on her
2799700	2804500	public presence. Towards the end of Summer 2022, rumours began to circulate that Ruby was no longer
2804500	2808580	living with her husband Kevin, and that although there was no official divorce, there wasn't any
2808580	2812660	apparent intent to re-establish contact. Word was that further this, it was reported that their
2812660	2817140	oldest son had also moved out of the family house, possibly staying with their father. It also began
2817140	2820660	to spread that Ruby's oldest daughter was no longer in contact with the family either, and
2820660	2824580	towards the end of September, she took to Instagram to respond to these rumours, stating that although
2824580	2828180	it was true that she was no longer in contact with those formerly close to her, and that she had
2828180	2831940	denounced the teachings and connections, many of the rumours were also unhelpful, and that she
2831940	2836100	would appreciate some privacy on the matter going forward. With the 8 Passengers YouTube channel
2836100	2839700	being brought to an end, you wouldn't be amiss to think that it could have provided an opportunity
2839700	2844100	to finally cut away from the superficiality that such a platform constrains YouTube, and back to
2844180	2849140	being that devoted parent. The cessation of uploads meant that Ruby no longer had a commitment to the
2849140	2853780	image she portrayed on said YouTube channel. However, it seems that image was actually more
2853780	2858100	charitable than reality, and now that she was unshackled, she was falling into a dangerous
2858100	2862820	spiral towards a fanatical belief system that sought to justify her parenting. If Ruby's
2862820	2866580	social media has told us anything, it was never about her family.
2866580	2873300	Intro
2873300	2876660	The problem when you're being pulled into an organisation like the one Jodie Hildebrandt
2876660	2880980	was operating is that you often don't realise that it's happening. Even if Ruby Franky was
2880980	2884660	never someone you wanted to run into, prior to the renovation of her Instagram account,
2884660	2888580	she still possessed some characteristics that could be identified with her. In these videos,
2888580	2892740	though, her only real personality was spreading the message of connections and applying it to
2892740	2896660	her own life. It should have been clear that this was a person deeply unwell. Nevertheless,
2896660	2900900	although many had now vocally expressed their concern, even likely many of those close to Ruby,
2900900	2905220	one of the scariest factors of cult mentality is that explicative dissonance, that you can just
2905220	2909220	dismiss someone by stating they're too ignorant to understand, and I have no doubt that's why
2909220	2913940	the Franky mother continued down this path without any outward trepidation or apprehension.
2913940	2917380	Her language was filled with a plethora of buzzwords that wouldn't really make sense in
2917380	2921300	regular conversation, but obviously held meaning within connections, and although most of the
2921300	2925860	online crowd rejected these doctrines, one person continued to reward Ruby's loyalty.
2925860	2931220	Jodie, who towards the end of 2022 invited Ruby onto her connections podcast and YouTube channel,
2931220	2935380	and appointed her to the business team and acclaimed her as a certified mental fitness
2935380	2940420	trainer. Certified by who? Well, we don't know, but I'm sure it only further emboldened Ruby's
2940420	2944980	image of herself as a missionary for this message in her mind. Perhaps this made little sense given
2944980	2949060	Ruby's staunchly religious upbringing, but although there were mentions of God and Christianity
2949060	2953620	in Connections writings, it mostly seems like a pseudo-scientific approach to supporting certain
2953620	2957940	conservative religious values. It seems that everyone who was in proximity of Ruby was
2957940	2961700	escaping as quickly as they could, but what about the people who couldn't?
2961700	2967860	If your kid came to you on fire, would you say, I'm so glad you trusted me to tell me you're on
2967860	2972020	fire, that if I put out the fire that's gonna really hurt and you're gonna end up with scabs
2972020	2977860	anyway, so I'm just gonna love you where you are right now? No! You throw them on the ground and
2977860	2982980	you start rolling them, you get a blanket and you start hitting the flames, and they're gonna say,
2982980	2988260	you're hurting me, you're beating me, you're controlling us, like, no dear, hold still,
2988260	2993700	I'm getting the fire out. That's what a loving parent does, because nobody will do it, it looks
2993700	2998260	to the world crazy. Her Moms of Truth account, although being a rather transparent advocacy
2998260	3002660	platform for the Connections way of life, also revolved around topics of parenting, hence the
3002660	3007460	Moms part of the account name. By now, people already had an idea of her parental methods,
3007460	3011620	but with more of these videos in the posts, it began to dawn on people that Ruby's opinions
3011620	3017220	were becoming even more extreme and aberrant. Ruby- What in the world? Yes, yes, sleepovers
3017220	3021300	are distorted. She wouldn't let her children sleep over at a friend's house, she doesn't like laid
3021300	3026020	back children or angry people, she and Jodie just get really annoyed at a meme for some reason,
3026020	3031220	and you also shouldn't be doing your nails out of insecurity, I guess. Ruby- I'm going to go out and
3031220	3036820	do my nails per se, there's nothing inherently inappropriate or distorted about doing your nails,
3036820	3046580	however, if I go and do my nails because I'm feeling ugly or I'm wanting to have some social
3046580	3051780	activity with somebody and I don't have any of my friends around and so I want to go engage with
3051780	3056820	the people at the nail salon because I want to distract myself because my life is not comfortable,
3057460	3063540	then those would be motives that would not be responsible. Ultimately though, I think what is
3063540	3067300	most concerning is the sort of morals that underscore this content, particularly from a
3067300	3071940	parenting perspective. Really, living in truth is just connections jargon for having an extreme
3071940	3076180	level of control in one's life. Everything you do is a choice, from every action to the expression
3076180	3080740	of every emotion, and you're more than what you feel, etc. It's not an inherently dangerous point
3080740	3084500	of view when presented under that image, and it's never a bad idea to try and encourage people
3084500	3088100	towards a state where they can channel their feelings more productively. At the same time,
3088100	3092340	this is a dangerous manifestation of it, and it promotes the ideal person through a very
3092340	3097140	homogenous lens, which is why Ruby and Jodie waste no time getting to micromanaging the motives
3097140	3101780	behind doing your nails. Those sorts of behaviours must be stamped out, and that's a particularly
3101780	3105060	detrimental point of view for one demographic, children.
3105060	3110900	Ruby- You, the mom, are not responsible to make school fun and entertaining.
3110900	3114180	Jodie- Whaaaat? Ruby- Yeah, you're not.
3114180	3119860	Guess what, if your child finds homeschool boring, that's because he chose to be bored.
3119860	3126820	That's because she chose to have a perception of needing to be entertained. It's a form of entitlement.
3126820	3130100	I don't need to explain the psychology behind why younger people may struggle
3130100	3133300	over controlling their emotions and their actions more than older people.
3133300	3137380	Misbehaviour is an inevitability, and what matters is that the lesson is learned.
3137380	3141460	The philosophy of connections, though, wants a mould, and a person to fit very tightly inside
3141460	3145380	that mould. Ruby Frankly was always a person who leaned towards more punitive parenting to
3145380	3150660	teach her children those messages, she saw as her duty to enact the consequences of those actions.
3150660	3155700	Yet with an ever narrowing view on what was even represented by good behaviour, her parenting style
3155700	3160100	was appearing more and more unhinged, with her continuing to promote these methods in her podcasts
3160100	3164740	and live videos, stating that she cared more about the pursuit of principles than her own children.
3164740	3168740	It would lead some to be quite concerned about the safety of a family in the care of this person
3168740	3174020	who seems to think that she has free reign to act as she wishes. After all, she is in truth,
3174020	3176980	and you are in distortion, something that she seemed to embrace when
3176980	3181140	emotionally reflecting on her decision to discontinue the 8 Passengers YouTube series.
3181140	3187300	You wonder why I left YouTube? It's to save my kids. No amount of money.
3188260	3196660	And I'm telling you, I was making millions, and I left it, because my kids were being
3196660	3204260	hurt with entitlement, they were being hurt with people's advice, and they didn't have a mother up
3204260	3209060	the front saying, I don't care what the world's opinion is, this is the truth, and this is where
3209060	3213700	I stand. And fortunately, I had a chance, I had them in my home long enough to do it,
3213700	3218340	and I'm not going to lose them. Normally, this would be a very good decision. I think most of
3218340	3222180	her critics agree that she should not have been sharing aspects of her family's life on the
3222180	3226260	YouTube channel, and it wouldn't be healthy for a marriage. But without any record on how she was
3226580	3231060	treating the children now, people are actually growing more concerned, especially how she spoke
3231060	3235300	about parenting in these clips. She seemed to not just be promoting traditional values,
3235300	3240180	but obsessive, overbearing, and restrictive ideas with the expectation that her children
3240180	3244660	will just turn around and say thank you. They're trying to hold you hostage, saying you need to
3244660	3249540	give me privacy, you need to honor my boundaries, you need to honor my feelings, you don't care
3249540	3258500	about me, you're invading my space, those are my personal feelings. No. In this home, you don't get
3258500	3264260	personal space, because this is my space, because I'm the parent. If you want your own personal
3264260	3270260	space, you'll need to get your own space. This is mine. And as long as you're living in my home,
3270260	3278340	it is my job to know everything about you. In 2023, these concerns were not eased,
3278340	3283220	and more TikTok accounts and media outlets began to pick up on her downward spiral, even referring
3283220	3287940	to older clips which had come under scrutiny in the past, but Ruby persisted. She was also still
3287940	3292340	distant from her husband, with many wondering if divorce would be the final outcome, but Ruby
3292340	3296260	persisted. Her relationships with her family weren't appearing to improve either, and one of the
3296260	3301060	strongest slights of all, her oldest daughter celebrated her 20th birthday at her sister Bonnie's,
3301060	3306260	with them celebrating in a video that was uploaded to their YouTube channel, but Ruby persisted.
3306260	3311620	So, Jodi and I have each shared an example from our own lives of what real love looks like,
3311620	3316820	which isn't what the world thinks is love. They'd push back and say, whoa, that's mean,
3316820	3322820	you're not going to be loved, your children are going to kick you out of their lives. Anytime
3322820	3327940	that you make a decision, and in the back of your mind you have, well, I want them to take care of
3327940	3333620	me in my old age, that's not love. That's not love. There was no circumstance under which her style
3333620	3336980	of parenting could possibly be wrong, and although she may have been a neglectful,
3336980	3341860	selfish parent in the past, this time she was going to get it right, by being a part of every
3341860	3346660	one of her remaining children's lives. She had to show them the way of truth, and lead them out
3346660	3353140	of distortion, towards those principles of honesty, responsibility, and humility.
3353140	3358020	Police say this is the house a young child escaped from, and went to a neighbor's house,
3358020	3360020	asking for food and water.
3360580	3361080	Yeah.
3363620	3372260	Music
3372260	3377060	On August the 30th of 2023, the police were called to the household of a concerned civilian
3377060	3381700	in Ivins, Utah, to follow up on reports of a juvenile in need of help. This individual was
3381700	3385780	described as malnourished with duct tape on the extremities, a condition so severe that the
3385780	3390100	authorities decided they would require hospital treatment. The evidence led officers to a nearby
3390100	3393540	home where they found another youngster in a similar condition, and transported them to a
3393540	3396980	hospital as well, with the remaining children in place under the care of the Department of
3396980	3400820	Child and Family Services. Following further investigation into this incident, two arrests
3400820	3404180	were made, Jody Hildebrandt, and Ruby Franke.
3404180	3415780	Music
3415780	3419460	It seems that many people's concerns were more than justified, and that it may not have just
3419460	3423940	been as bad as some may have imagined, but worse. Over the coming days, more details would be
3423940	3428340	revealed as neighbors and family members expressed relief that action had finally been taken. Ruby's
3428340	3432180	oldest daughter was one of the first to post a statement to her Instagram, stating that herself
3432180	3436340	and her family had been trying to tell the police and CPS for years about this, and they were glad
3436340	3440660	that they had finally stepped in. Franke's sisters also posted a joint Instagram statement expressing
3440660	3444900	the necessity for Franke and Hildebrandt's detention. Ruby's oldest also requested help on
3444900	3449140	finding any incriminating clips that could help the legal case against the two detainees. This
3449220	3453060	would be elaborated on in future videos by Bonnie and Julie, both of which state that they had an
3453060	3457300	otherwise pretty strong family relationship until Jody and connections became involved,
3457300	3461700	and would eventually cause the rift between them and Ruby to open up. As sisters, they're obviously
3461700	3465540	going to be more sympathetic to a family member they've known for years, but they still don't
3465540	3467620	defend or justify her actions.
3467620	3472260	Jody Hildebrandt-"We all felt weird about this Jody lady, we weren't comfortable with it,
3472260	3476100	we didn't like it, we didn't like the teachings Ruby was bringing to the family functions,
3476100	3480500	and we were this close to telling her if you come to our family events anymore,
3480500	3484500	we do not want to hear what you were learning through connections because we don't like it.
3484500	3492420	My thoughts towards Ruby and Jody and Kevin and connections is that it was all bullcrap.
3493300	3500180	It was complete indoctrination of this thing that they created."
3500180	3504020	It was also revealed that even Ruby's neighbors had contacted the police on multiple occasions
3504020	3508260	regarding her behavior, which included taping paper over her window, leaving her children
3508260	3512340	alone in the house for weeks on end, and having them pulling weeds outside in the garden in 100
3512340	3516020	degree Fahrenheit heats, stating that although the police would make an appearance, they could
3516020	3520500	never find any actual evidence of illicit activity. On Friday the 1st of September,
3520500	3524180	with evidence of videos filmed at Hildebrandt's house a couple days before placing them at the
3524180	3527780	scene of the crime, and evidence consistent with the wounds inflicted on the victims,
3527780	3531540	they were both charged with six counts of aggravated child abuse and denied bail due
3531540	3534980	to the severity of the injuries sustained, which were revealed to be allegedly from
3534980	3539620	being restrained while honey and cayenne pepper were rubbed into wounds. Over the following weeks,
3539620	3543460	old plates would re-emerge once more with the context of what we were now aware of,
3543460	3547380	leaving many to argue that this could have been prevented if authorities had acted faster.
3547380	3551380	And they're gonna say, you're hurting me, you're beating me, you're controlling us, like,
3551380	3554660	no dear, hold still, I'm getting the fire out.
3554660	3558900	Frankie appeared in court via video link on the 5th of September to defend her actions,
3558980	3562580	and with the presence of her estranged husband, state attorneys, and other parents,
3562580	3567220	proceeded to make detailed accusations of serious sexual misconduct against her own child.
3567220	3571140	She provided no evidence for this, but did not hold back, and even referred to the offspring
3571140	3576020	of people in the room. I suppose the implication is that she is using these allegations to justify
3576020	3580020	her own reactions. It didn't appear to work though, although the judge requested the child
3580020	3583780	be placed in a home with no other peers as a precautionary measure. A few days later,
3583780	3587860	adding to the ever increasing list of people speaking out, Kevin's sisters gave statements
3587860	3592180	against Ruby's claims, and also revealed more information regarding her and Kevin's separation,
3592180	3596980	stating that Jody had moved in with the Frankie's in 2022, which is when she tightened her strangle
3596980	3601700	hold on the family, not even allowing Kevin to speak to Ruby unless she was present. Eventually
3601700	3605780	she encouraged Ruby to separate from Kevin, and he was moved to a townhouse where a minder from
3605780	3610180	connections would watch over him. The in-laws viewed Kevin as being brainwashed, and although
3610180	3614420	they believe he's a good person, they admit there are more questions than answers relating to how
3614420	3618900	he behaved throughout the situation. Like Ruby, at this point he had not made any comments to the
3618900	3623060	media, so people were unsure of his position. In a brief statement on the 18th of September,
3623060	3627140	his lawyer stated that he did not wish to point fingers and wanted to focus on rebuilding
3627140	3631060	relationships, though this did not address his involvement in the actual allegations.
3631060	3634900	This would change on the 5th of October however, when People Magazine would publish an article
3634900	3638900	titled Inside the Ruby Frankie Case, which provided a perspective from the estranged
3638900	3642820	husband with his lawyer once again doing a majority of the talking. Relating to the claims
3642820	3647380	at hand, Randy Kester, speaking on behalf of Kevin, stated that Ruby's former life companion
3647380	3651220	was shocked at hearing the details of the arrest, claiming that he had been awfully deceived into
3651220	3655460	the status of the children, and that he had only spoken to Ruby sporadically over the past year,
3655460	3660180	with her separating from him after claiming that his attitude was infesting their family,
3660180	3664420	whatever that means, and that the oldest son had also moved out with Kevin, but Jody had stepped
3664420	3668740	in on that matter as well. His lawyer states that he was isolated from his whole family, and was
3668740	3673300	only reached out three or four times over the next year, thus was not kept in the loop regarding
3673300	3677380	the rest of the family's status. This seemed to separate him from the recent events as a whole,
3677380	3681140	in spite of the observable problems on the YouTube channel and elsewhere on social media.
3681140	3684980	It was clear that Kevin was being highly cautious about making statements to the press,
3684980	3689300	and why he had mostly refrained from doing so, he wanted custody of the remaining children,
3689300	3693380	and this was clear from the September statement. In comment sections, many were still suspicious
3693380	3697140	as to his involvement with the whole situation though, with Bonnie being quite vocal about his
3697140	3701060	inaction while it transpired, and further news being released that he had attempted to have
3701060	3704820	his daughter charged with theft following a house visit in which he took some items.
3704820	3712740	Bonnie- The one person that could have done something within his legal right was Kevin.
3712740	3719380	We had zero contact with him. It was Kevin's job to check in on things, and he did not.
3720500	3724500	With everything leading up to the arrest of Ruby Frankie and Jody Hildebrandt in mind,
3724500	3728740	their detention could have signalled an end to this terrifying saga, but it turned out to be
3728740	3732900	just the beginning of increasingly bizarre and contentious claims from all sides that only
3732900	3737060	provoked more concern, and let the living situation of vulnerable parties in limbo.
3737060	3740660	How much did certain parties know, and how much could they be trusted?
3740660	3744740	The shadow of one woman still loomed over the case.
3754500	3759540	On the 17th October 2023, the judge presiding over the case ordered it closed to the public
3759540	3763300	and the media from there on. This is probably for the best given the beast they were dealing with,
3763300	3767700	and the fact that anything said would immediately be reported on and speculated about. Ruby Frankie
3767700	3771860	still has immense power as a former content creator, and even if what she said was held
3771860	3775860	in contempt, it was still disseminated and discussed, which likely wasn't the best for
3775860	3780180	any parties concerned. However, in spite of the subsequent silence we may see from this case,
3780180	3784100	this uncertainty will not necessarily provide security or reassurance.
3784100	3788500	On the 18th December, Ruby enters a plea deal shifting blame onto her business partner,
3788500	3791620	of which I'll give an overview soon, but with censoring set for February,
3791620	3795060	although prison time is a possibility, nothing is guaranteed.
3814100	3835220	It's difficult to say what the exact outcome will be of the following months. To all internet
3835220	3839460	dwellers, the evidence presents an open and shut case, but the real world never operates by the
3839460	3842900	rules of the world wide web, and it's not impossible that Ruby walks out of the courts
3842900	3846660	as a free citizen. However, this also does not mean that civil courts will agree with this
3846660	3851460	verdict, and going off the evidence available, they probably will not deem her fit to be a parent.
3851460	3855540	In spite of it all, there is a distinct possibility that she will come out fighting,
3855540	3860020	and that this isn't the end of the saga. She made it very clear in her court appearances the length
3860020	3864260	she is willing to go to defend her actions, and who knows what she may say about other parties
3864260	3868900	when given the opportunity to. While she still possessed a voice, she was going to use it.
3868900	3873540	Custody is a very sensitive matter that you cannot rush analysis of. To deem someone mentally
3873540	3877460	capable of overseeing the lives of multiple youths, particularly when they may have already
3877460	3881620	suffered, is something that one cannot really afford to mishandle. Yet looking at the immediate
3881620	3886100	family and potential guardians, you'd be a bit pressed to really trust anyone. When you fall
3886100	3890340	down such a rabbit hole, you're prone to often pushing the more reasonable people in your life
3890340	3895060	away, and the only people remaining are people who may be treated with suspicion. From what we know,
3895060	3900020	Ruby cut off nearly everyone in her life, or vice versa, with only a couple exceptions,
3900020	3904660	Jodie and Kevin. I think we can rule out Jodie as a potential custody bearer, but what about
3904660	3909540	her estranged ex-husband? He had clearly set out intent to rebuild the bridges that had been burned
3909540	3913460	in the past year of their separation. Additionally, he had recently filed for divorce,
3913460	3917220	officially severing the ties between himself and his estranged wife. This seemed to be the
3917220	3921380	signs of someone determined to make his own statement, but how much could he be trusted?
3922100	3927060	Well, I'll just say it, I wanted to have sex a lot.
3927060	3932180	With cult mentality, it's very difficult to tell where the network begins and ends. In this case,
3932180	3936900	the prime individual to obtain custody over the children, Kevin, is a very untrustworthy figure.
3936900	3941220	Outside of recent events where he reportedly acted with hostility towards the eldest daughter,
3941220	3945780	accounts from even his direct family tie him very close to the connections network. We know that
3945780	3952100	they were involved from at latest 2019, before any of this transpired, and this persisted to 2022
3952100	3957300	or even 2023. Though they were very sympathetic to his predicament, as revealed in the article,
3957300	3961380	even his sisters were concerned that he was still suffering from the symptoms of brainwashing.
3961380	3965380	Regardless of whether he is a victim of cult indoctrination in this case, it doesn't make
3965380	3969380	him more mentally fit to be a parent right now. If anything, he should be focused on actually
3969380	3973140	sorting himself out before expecting a responsibility that he had demonstrably
3973140	3977620	failed to live up to in the past. Although he did not initiate the separation as far as we know,
3977620	3982500	we know he did agree to it, did not challenge it, and accepted little to no contact with his
3982500	3987380	children, even when Rui was visibly mentally deteriorating on social media. There are some
3987380	3991460	very cynical voices in this that could even say that he anticipated this happening and
3991460	3995300	agreed to the separation to give himself the best footing for a future custody case.
3995300	4000660	I know that's a very tenuous speculation, but there is a serious lack of trust right now.
4000660	4007860	So imagine going out and weeding your garden, but by weeding the garden, I mean you have this
4007860	4013700	belief that weeding the garden is plucking the leaves off of all the weeds, but you leave the
4013700	4019380	stems and the roots in place, but you just gotta weed, I gotta go pluck the little leaves off.
4019380	4024420	That's parenting today. Video archives still build a case that is skeptical of his intent.
4024420	4029300	It appeared in videos with his wife justifying their actions, actions they took while working
4029300	4034020	with connections that was a pipeline to Ruby's downward spiral. Just because he didn't go to
4034020	4038580	the extremes that his spouse did, just because he is the lesser of those two evils doesn't mean he
4038580	4042980	is the good option. So what are the choices outside of that? Well you could look towards
4042980	4047380	the rest of the family, Ruby's siblings in particular appeared quite invested in safeguarding
4047380	4052100	the children, and on the surface they didn't seem to have any direct connections to connections,
4052100	4056740	with all of them quite openly disavowing the institution after the Moms of Truth were arrested.
4056740	4060500	At the same time there were still questions surrounding their background and given how
4060500	4064740	similar it was to Ruby's, particularly given their YouTube channels, and how a large majority
4064740	4070020	of the family members have all been involved with that content at some point. Outside of the cults,
4070020	4074100	there was another network that may provoke caution within the courts and the concerned parties.
4074100	4078660	Yeah, I'll send the bull over to Ruby, you ask the question, and we can all answer, or
4079380	4083060	we don't have to all answer, just a few, so kind of just say what you want.
4083060	4086340	Although it goes without saying that Ruby's actions are not a reflection on any of the
4086340	4090900	sisters or family members at that, there was a very strong YouTube relationship built up with
4090900	4095060	her and her family in the years since the founding of the channel. I think many would agree that the
4095060	4099300	children need to be as far away from that as possible, the first thing they need is privacy.
4099300	4103540	Unfortunately, although most of the worst actions happened after the YouTube channel, it is Ruby's
4103540	4107460	influencer status that has brought her the most attention in this case. The family vlogging
4107460	4112340	network has been somewhat shaken by Ruby's actions, the only person who has made an appearance
4112340	4116420	elsewhere since Ruby distanced herself from her sisters was her daughter, who was an adult at the
4116420	4120820	time, and could make her own decisions. It would be hard for the children to have a healthy home
4120820	4125460	environment if the others still intend to upload content. Bonnie, who was probably the most vocal
4125460	4129220	about her sister's actions since the arrests were made, has made some interesting decisions on
4129220	4133860	speaking on the matter, including uploading a now deleted video where she recounted her childhood
4133860	4138660	relationship with Ruby in rather extensive detail. She deleted the video, probably realising it
4138660	4142900	wasn't necessary, and that it could also be a legally sensitive matter, but it did almost
4142900	4146820	represent one of the concerns of this sort of family affair, that when you've been online for
4146820	4151540	so long that sometimes you lose grasp of the line between what needs to be online and what can be
4151540	4152800	left for the real world.
4152800	4164340	So when I say that Ruby and Kevin and Jodie and connections have been destroying our lives offline for the last three years,
4164340	4166580	that is exactly what they've been doing.
4166580	4170580	In the years leading up to arrests, Ruby had either distanced people so much from the family
4170580	4174180	that they had no involvement in the lives of those concerned at all, or caught them in the
4174180	4178740	orbit of something so toxic that question marks loomed over their heads. As the most influential
4178740	4183140	family vlogger in a family of family vloggers, I suppose that was somewhat inevitable, because
4183140	4185780	something had been done about it sooner. Well.
4196980	4203060	And it didn't make sense to me to hold my kids accountable, hold my kids accountable, and then
4203060	4209220	Christmas come, and then it's not consistent, and all of a sudden they get Santa Claus coming and
4209220	4216740	pouring gifts upon them. And so we're going to not be celebrating Christmas in the same way that
4216740	4221460	we've done in the past. We're going to celebrate Christmas for what it really stands for, which is
4221460	4228100	the Savior was born, and because the Savior was born, we get this beautiful opportunity to change,
4228100	4232820	our hearts get to soften, and so for Christmas we're inviting you to soften your heart.
4234660	4238500	Ruby Franke was always a strict parent, and certainly didn't act in line with many people's
4238500	4242740	expectations of a 21st century millennial mother. Nevertheless, for the times she was known for
4242740	4246180	threatening to behead fluffy toys, and not bringing a hungry daughter lunch, there would
4246180	4250100	always be people who were quite vocal in defending her as working from a more traditional parenting
4250100	4253540	model. To many of them, this was just a person who was raising a child, as they had been raised
4253540	4258180	themselves, this was a cultural and ancestral matter that had likely been held over generations,
4258180	4262500	and had seldom failed. At the same time, most of them would inevitably go on to disagree with what
4262500	4266500	the authorities discovered, and declare that she had fully lost the plots. You could see this shift
4266500	4270740	in comment sections in conservative news outlets before and after her arrest. On the other hand,
4270740	4274420	to many critics, these clips were signs that something should have been done sooner, and this
4274420	4278740	behavior was a slippery slope to what inevitably occurred. I think there is a point behind this,
4278820	4282820	at the same time there is a somewhat exceptional element to Rui's parenting that was often
4282820	4287300	overlooked, but for me it was the most indicative that something could spiral out of control.
4287300	4291700	Parents are deeply flawed like the rest of us, and some of them will fuck up, some of them will be
4291700	4295300	angry, some of them will be harsh, and some of them will make the wrong decisions occasionally
4295300	4299860	at the expense of the wellbeing of those around them. There are no mandated parenting classes,
4299860	4303300	even though you could make the argument there should be, it's fairly straightforward for many
4303300	4307940	adults to have a kid if they wish, but what's not straightforward is actually raising them.
4307940	4311700	Most people can recall a difficult stage of their childhood, and how they may have also
4311700	4315380	posed a challenge to the rest of their family, what matters is how the more mature parties
4315380	4319460	navigate that, and at what point they're willing to say that they need to change something about
4319460	4324660	themselves to help you. Bad parenting can come from a place of ignorance, other times arrogance,
4324660	4328580	other times the refusal to be a better person, something that is essential when dealing with
4328580	4332580	people who are wired to act impulsively. Within reason, most of the time you'd recommend that
4332580	4335940	a parent gets some professional help with how they handle children who are in a difficult
4335940	4339780	stage of their life, and doesn't fall down that slope of actually exacerbating the problem,
4339780	4344100	making them act out even more. However, being introduced to Ruby Frankie by the 8 Passengers
4344100	4348100	video about what she hadn't told us, while many were rightfully struck by the severity of her
4348100	4352580	punishment against her oldest son, I was strangely unnerved about the language she used concerning
4352580	4356340	her youngest, and how he processed the news that he would not have access to technology
4356340	4357660	over the coming months.
4357660	4364460	We had the expectation that the kids would not be on the iPads.
4367420	4373660	We said the kids would not be on the iPads.
4373660	4377740	Now in this video, he was noticeably evasive in confronting his mother over the matter,
4377740	4381660	very possibly because he was embarrassed about being discovered breaching the house rules,
4381660	4386940	yet Ruby begins to use very strange language regarding his ability to be humble and sit with
4386940	4394300	her. The fact that he's not willing to sit with me and be humble and talk is a big,
4395500	4401420	is a big demonstration to me that he has some distorted views and that he is in a lot of shame.
4402060	4406620	Both my friend and I who were listening noted the same motivation, that this was someone who
4406620	4412220	has actually been to therapy, but hasn't been properly changed by it. Jonah Hill was using
4412220	4417020	therapy speak to control his girlfriend Sarah, his now ex-girlfriend, and it's important that
4417020	4421260	we go over this misuse of therapy language which is kind of a thing these days.
4421900	4425980	Throughout 2023, there has been a rise in criticism surrounding notions of therapy speak
4425980	4429820	and over-therapy. In both of these cases, they are exemplified by people who have gone to therapy
4429820	4434460	to address some of their issues, but haven't necessarily ameliorated them, more so finding
4434460	4438460	new ways to justify them. This reared its head during the Jonah Hill situation this year,
4438540	4442780	where many felt that he had behaved possessively and masqueraded it under the pretense of setting
4442780	4447020	boundaries. It's not really my place to hypothesise how this happens with every individual,
4447020	4451100	but I think the greatest issue is when a person goes into therapy to not necessarily change,
4451100	4455420	but to reinforce the perspective that their own ideas or themselves are misunderstood.
4455420	4460140	We know that Ruby id experienced criticism pre-2020 for her parenting techniques, and
4460140	4464460	perhaps she was feeling insecure about this, but instead of seeking out a reputable professional,
4464460	4469180	she found connections, which we know by the 2020 upload was an organisation she was becoming
4469180	4473420	closer with. Bad parenting can come from a multitude of sources, but if there is an element
4473420	4477180	of reasonable doubt, there is the hope that maybe with some actual help they can address these
4477180	4481100	problems and improve themselves. The problem with Ruby was that she'd move past that stage
4481100	4485500	of confronting her problems, but instead opting to be an even harsher parent on the basis of the
4485500	4489900	advice she received, and using therapy speak to defend those actions. This was not just troubling
4489900	4494380	for her judgement, but for those around her too. This is dangerous in the sense that it can cause
4494380	4499020	people to psychologically validate abusive dynamics, which is bad enough between two people,
4499020	4503260	but between a parent and their child is extremely treacherous. It gives the adult no space for
4503260	4508460	self-reflection, no room for change, no opportunity to avert disaster, because she can just turn around
4508460	4512540	and say that if the child doesn't respond well to her disciplinary measures then it's their problem,
4512540	4517340	which as ludicrous as it sounds is exactly how Ruby thought. For outsiders, it might be very
4517340	4522060	apparent how flawed this perspective is, but for a family, those who may have looked up to her and
4522060	4526140	trusted her, this was psychologically soul-destroying behaviour that could very easily
4526140	4529820	gaslight a young person into believing that what they were suffering through was their own faults.
4530940	4538220	So victim is a word that many of us use to acknowledge when a person is using their choices
4538220	4544300	to not be responsible for themselves. What happens when a youngster in a difficult place doesn't
4544300	4548700	respond well to these methods like they didn't? There was no set end for Ruby's methods because
4548700	4553180	she's spoken to the professionals in her mind, and they've told her that she's right, and if
4553180	4557660	people don't respond to it then they just haven't got the message yet. If she had ended up going to
4557660	4561900	a different therapist then this situation may have had a very different outcome, but as said,
4561900	4567740	when you go to a therapist, you need to want to be better, and I don't think Ruby ever wanted that.
4578700	4582860	As we know now, Ruby has pled guilty to four counts of child abuse, with two of the counts
4582860	4586140	being dropped as part of the plea deal. Whether she will be instrumental in the case against
4586140	4590700	Jodie is yet to be seen, but the message during this plea was unambiguous. This was a woman taken
4590700	4594780	advantage of by a counsellor in a position of power and whose weaknesses were exploited to
4594780	4599740	adopt increasingly radical and dangerous views. That Ruby Franky was just a devoted mother on
4599740	4604460	the quest for continuous improvement who had been led astray. However, I think many would find this
4604460	4608460	hard to believe with the evidence available. Allow me to explain. Ruby had always been an
4608460	4613100	advocate of what she described as tough love. This method was something that she clearly felt
4613100	4617820	an affinity to, and in her mind worked effectively. However, this was the 21st century, and as an
4617820	4622220	individual posting content onto a modern platform, she was always bound to receive some pushback,
4622220	4626060	and although she garnered the most attention in 2020, she had clearly experienced criticism
4626060	4629500	before then, particularly regarding the treatment of their older son, who had been experiencing
4629500	4636300	some behaviour issues. I think Ruby was always somewhat aware that her techniques were unpopular
4636300	4640220	for their time, which is often why she stated that such conversations would occur off camera.
4640220	4643660	This would often provide an impression that there was more bliss in the family household than there
4643660	4647500	actually was. This didn't mean that she wasn't prone to opening herself up to criticism,
4647500	4650780	and when you document your family and what is happening, particularly when you have an upload
4650780	4654540	schedule to commit to, you will be drawn into these discussions, and your audience will inevitably
4654540	4658700	be invested. An example of this was when she and Kevin had to stay at a hotel, while announcing
4658700	4662700	that her older son had been sent to the Anasazi wilderness camp to set him straight. Regardless
4662700	4666140	of how good the establishment may be, there were always going to be people who would take issue
4666140	4670620	given the controversy of wilderness therapy as a whole. It was also apparent that it just wasn't
4670620	4675420	working on an individual basis for that son. Now when addressing results that may not line up with
4675420	4679340	the preconceived notions of parenting that you're familiar with, you can either begin a period of
4679340	4682780	self-reflection that may or may not lead to character growth, or you can double down on
4682780	4686460	your approach and decide that it's everyone else who is in the wrong. Parenting is a matter that
4686460	4691020	many people take pride in, and Ruby was certainly a proud mother, though maybe not in the sense that
4691020	4694940	statement may typically assume. She was very committed to her styles and the results that
4694940	4698940	she believed it yielded, however she was also a very committed proponent of authority, but a
4698940	4703100	lot of the authority that she looked towards did not align with her outlook. Most psychologists
4703100	4706620	and therapists would say that her techniques were certainly far from optimal in addressing
4706620	4711020	misbehaviour, and could easily aggravate a person who is acting out. This is not something that she
4711020	4714700	would have wanted to hear, and as a person who positioned herself as a voice of authority on
4714700	4719340	parenting matters, she couldn't ever see herself as undermining her image. All the same she needed
4719340	4723500	a way to respond and justify their behaviour that had more backing than just her personal
4723500	4732220	inclinations. By her own admission, Ruby was not cash-strapped as her channel accumulated
4732220	4736620	hundreds of millions of views each year. She was a person who had a lot of options if she wanted to
4736620	4740300	change her parenting style. I'm sure there were many top-end psychologists who would have told
4740300	4744140	her in short terms what the best way to navigate the challenges that she had to inevitably confront
4744140	4748140	were, but Ruby already had her solution to everything. She wasn't looking for advice,
4748140	4751980	she was looking for affirmation. This is how she found the connections classroom.
4759260	4763340	On the surface, it would be hard to look at Hildebrandt's writing and understand the direct
4763340	4768380	relationship between escaping distortion and Ruby's insecurity over her parenting for an
4768380	4773020	organisation initially set up to help individuals overcome addiction. The parenting course,
4773020	4777420	although full of the usual cultish buzzwords we've become used to, still seems to teach
4777420	4781500	principles that you'd feel are quite inoffensive at their core. However, when you take a closer
4781500	4785740	look at the syllabus, you realise that actually, the parenting really mentions nothing about what
4785740	4790220	the parents do, and you realise that what appealed to Ruby was not the fact that she could fix
4790220	4793340	herself, it was the fact that she thought she could fix her kids.
4803020	4831420	I'm not going to pay $220 for the connections parenting classes,
4831420	4836140	but the summary really tells you most of what you need to know. That children, like adults,
4836140	4841340	are in this constant state of distortion, and that your job as a parent is to lead them out of it.
4841340	4844860	How do you do that? Well, you have to show them the way forward, but ultimately they are steps
4844860	4849020	you cannot make for them. Probably the most illuminating quote in the course summary reads,
4849020	4853820	the motivation to self-care must come from each individual. Nobody can do it for you,
4853820	4858620	and you cannot do it for your children. They must learn, and it's our responsibility to teach them
4858620	4863420	how to care for themselves. This seems to ideologically line up to the mother who wouldn't
4863420	4867820	take lunch to her six-year-old when she forgot to make it. Beyond that, though, there is this very
4867820	4872460	interesting combination of ideas in how connections and Hildebrandt view parenting. It's not really a
4872460	4876780	parent's job to care for their children, but it's also a parent's job to teach a child to care for
4876780	4882380	themselves. How do you teach someone that way without caring, without providing some form of
4882380	4910780	actual support? Within connections, Ruby Franke found the ends to justify those means,
4910780	4915260	and as she came under stronger criticisms, she dug her heels in more. After all, now she could
4915260	4918860	respond to those people calling her out saying that she had talked to licensed professionals,
4918860	4922620	who advised that it was actually a completely just punishment to confiscate a bed for seven
4922620	4927020	months from their son who played pranks on their brother. From her perspective, it simultaneously
4927020	4931820	washed her hands of responsibility while proving her methods correct, but many outsiders saw it
4931820	4936780	for the farce and cop-out that it was, and voted with their viewership. This pushed Ruby further,
4936780	4940620	taking up more responsibility in the connections classroom, strengthening her bond with Jodie,
4940620	4944540	who not just adored her commitment to the cause, but also her subscriber count and the clout that
4944540	4949340	she pulled. It was true that Ruby Franke was drawn into a cult-like mentality, but only because she
4949340	4954540	felt the world around her needed to change, rather than herself. As an internet literate person with
4954540	4958620	access to review websites and media platforms that say more than I have, there were plenty of
4958620	4962380	signs that she could have picked up to tell her that this was a course that may not be the best
4962460	4967820	for those around her. The connections had torn families apart, but Ruby didn't care about that,
4967820	4973340	she cared about herself, and how she had to be right in her ways. If that isn't distortion,
4973340	4979260	then I don't know what is. Ruby Franke didn't want to be better, she wanted to be the best,
4979260	4982700	and yet that hubris led her to be one of the worst.
4982940	4989340	Jodie's latest victim was this eight channels lady. I knew in two seconds, I knew in two
4989340	4997580	seconds, that Jodie absolutely wanted that lady's platform to become more powerful, and then she
4997580	5004620	would lie to that lady, she would make that lady as mentally sick as a dog, then she would lie to
5004620	5008620	her like she was helping her, and then she would steal that lady's power. For more information
5008620	5013020	on Jodie and how dangerous she truly was, I recommend watching J Aubrey's video on the matter,
5013020	5016300	and I'll also link a few other illuminating pieces in the pinned comment as well.
5026460	5032140	Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting different results. Although
5032140	5036780	its origins aren't known for certain, it's often accredited to Albert Einstein, and although there's
5036860	5041900	obviously a nuance to it, I think he had a point. Following the arrest of Ruby Franke, one of her
5041900	5045820	sisters in law recalled a time where she had come round for dinner, and had proceeded to chastise
5045820	5049980	her for letting her own children have snacks after food, claiming that they were running a mock
5049980	5055180	in the kitchen. Ruby didn't just view her parenting as the right way, she viewed it as the only way,
5055180	5060380	and she viewed her platform as a way to spread that message, but like many hypothesised narcissists,
5060380	5065100	their usual channel isn't really a way to spread that message, it's more to create a whole new one
5065100	5069420	entirely. When going over the 8 Passengers YouTube channel, you'll find countless moments
5069420	5073020	of bliss and harmony within the family. The overarching theme was that this was a group of
5073020	5077980	people who were happy with each other's company, documented by a doting mother who just wanted to
5077980	5082140	capture those fleeting snapshots as a permanent time capsule for the collective memory, but there
5082140	5093180	was something deeper to the channel and how she approached it. One of the challenges regarding
5093180	5097740	watching family channels, is how they often present an ideated version of how a family
5097740	5102300	operates, particularly for those who either want to be parents, or are parents already,
5102300	5106460	and looking for guidance. There's a lot of selective footage, in a way that's what you'd
5106460	5109900	expect, not everything needs to be a part of a YouTube channel, particularly if you want to
5109900	5114380	reflect on those memories fondly. Nevertheless, a lot of people saw the image that the Franke's
5114380	5119340	projected onto their channel, and often asked Ruby how her children were so wonderful and obedient.
5119340	5123580	The secret was that most of the time, you don't talk about the times where that parental style
5123580	5129180	falls short, and from the evidence available, it did so on multiple occasions. An often overlooked
5129180	5133820	detail in the May 2020 upload, What We Haven't Told You, was Ruby talking about the instances
5133820	5137580	her oldest son had played a variety of pranks on his brother, and choosing to list an example
5137580	5141100	that literally happened on the day he came back from the Anasazi wilderness camp.
5155100	5159980	Those are not signs of a person who is responding well to your castigation, not to mention that
5159980	5164540	Anasazi was already the result of years of misbehaviour by their own accounts. Of course,
5164540	5168380	people wouldn't receive this impression if you watched 8 Passengers content most of the time,
5168380	5172060	because that's not what they showed, but the son clearly didn't appreciate this, and one of the
5172060	5176220	few details from the insider interview that I actually believe was that her son had encouraged
5176220	5180700	to upload the video in its current form. My personal belief is that I think he anticipated
5180700	5184700	the backlash it would receive, in the past he'd encourage his mother to talk about the discipline
5184700	5189340	he was subjected to, while she was often the more evasive. So although I can say that I think Ruby
5189340	5193420	was extremely hard headed in the best way to raise her children, she was also very aware of the
5193420	5198060	negative press that this would generate, but she just couldn't reconcile both without sacrificing
5198060	5203340	her pride or her reputation. So the natural outcome is she's just going to need to be hungry,
5204780	5211180	and hopefully nobody gives her food, and nobody steps in and gives her a lunch. Probably the most
5211180	5215260	illuminating example of this was her response to the withholding of sustenance from her daughter,
5215260	5218940	and the accompanying clip. In the insider interview, she attempts to reframe it as a
5218940	5222700	matter she was actually very sympathetic to, and would've helped if she could have,
5222700	5226140	and although there may be context around the clip that we're not aware of, there's also just
5226140	5230860	a callousness in the clip itself that could not be alternatively contextualised. She knew that
5230860	5235260	this was often frowned upon, and when the fire was put to her feet, she exhibited cowardice.
5235260	5240140	If she really was as committed to the regime as she said she was, why would she backtrack?
5240140	5245020	Because the YouTube channel was more important, how she was perceived was more important than how
5245020	5250780	she was, yet she was never wrong, she couldn't be wrong. There was this continuous narrative that
5250860	5254860	people just didn't get it, they didn't have an understanding, they weren't mature enough,
5254860	5259100	they didn't possess the full context, and although all these are viable responses in a case by case
5259100	5263340	scenario, here they felt more like rhetorical devices to keep Ruby and Kevin in the right.
5263340	5267180	There was always something that people didn't know that meant that the Frankies could not be
5267180	5271020	judged. Their evidence of good parenting was right in front of them, their content,
5271020	5275580	and their children, perhaps one in the same in their mind. Ruby Frankie used the YouTube
5275580	5280700	channel to create a reality where her disciplinary methods resulted in a happy family, with her
5280700	5284860	and her husband even boasting that when CPS came by their house, they remarked that they would
5284860	5289980	actually have to start watching their YouTube content to get some tips on parenting, a comment
5289980	5294620	so close to satire itself that it may well be true. Yet after the run-in with the internet,
5294620	5298220	they all stepped back from this narrative entirely, and often avoided any mention of
5298220	5303020	discipline at all. In turn, the YouTube channel became this medium to fabricate a family that
5303020	5307500	only really existed in Ruby's mind to present to the audience for their consumption, the one where
5307500	5311420	she holds them to account, they embrace their retribution, and then they grow up to be these
5311420	5316140	wonderful members of society, all thanks to her and her wonderful mothering techniques.
5316140	5320380	In this case, the 8 Passengers channel became a damaging platform for the family's wellbeing,
5320380	5325180	because what once was an illusion had now become a delusion. Ruby was using the platform to throw
5325180	5329020	up a smokescreen not just for her viewers, but for herself, but if you looked at the evidence,
5329020	5333660	everything was going perfectly fine. Yet this just made it less believable because they hadn't
5333740	5337420	committed to changing anything at all, and if nothing had changed about their methods,
5337420	5341740	how could they suddenly present this image that everything was hunky-dory now? The people on
5341740	5346220	YouTube did not buy it, and as the views fell, so did the validation. Like many people with
5346220	5350620	narcissistic tendencies, Ruby was steadfast but fragile, and still needed to hear that
5350620	5355340	everything was fine, boasting about her methods on podcasts with her new partner in crime.
5355340	5360940	I was really hoping that like, keeping them home from school and wiping the floorboards would like,
5360940	5367020	really bring pain. Like, oh my gosh, I really want to change this behaviour that I've been
5367020	5371740	exhibiting. And then it didn't, it didn't, like, it wasn't painful for them. They're like, oh yeah,
5371740	5375020	we get to stay home from school and clean floorboards. This is kind of fun. It's like, ah,
5375820	5381260	so, you know, they've had these visceral experiences, you know, and they haven't,
5381980	5386220	they haven't affected them. It's because they're so numb. The truth was that it wasn't fine,
5386220	5390460	but nobody could prove it, because Ruby was too proud to admit that she was losing control of
5390540	5394060	everything, and that she would rather go down with her methods than change her ways,
5394060	5397900	that she would rather commit to a cult that validates her perceptions than actually get
5397900	5402780	serious help. In her mind, her punishments were just the consequences rather than the cause,
5403340	5405980	and yet everyone had to live with them.
5412380	5416140	Probably the most indicative piece of evidence that showed her character was her own court
5416140	5420060	appearance, where she implied that such harsh abuse against one of her own children could be
5420060	5424300	justified by launching into a series of allegations regarding sexual misconduct. I
5424300	5428700	obviously cannot comment on the verity of such claims, but it encapsulated the perfect mix of
5428700	5433740	cowardice and callousness, the refusal to admit that she had failed as a parent alongside the
5433740	5438140	context that means she was right all along. To me, this defence was a symptom that Jodie
5438140	5442460	and Ruby were careening towards some sort of modern-day exorcism scenario, where they could
5442460	5446940	create this reality that they had to purge evil from this person rather than actually seeing the
5446940	5451020	evil in themselves that was driving them to do this. This was confirmed on the 90th of December
5451020	5454940	when details of Ruby's behaviour were revealed, of which I'm not going to verbally list out and
5454940	5458300	would recommend the faint of heart to turn away, but could be seen on the screen now,
5458300	5462700	it is as horrifying as one may conceptualise. The justification for these acts was that those
5462700	5467020	she did this to were possessed, sometimes to justify one act of evil you have to create a
5467020	5471820	greater one, and as a person who was hellbent on being right, no matter how awful Ruby was,
5471820	5475900	in her mind she was always fighting against something worse, but really she was just
5475900	5479980	fighting her own reflection. We could sit here and debate whether an adult will reflect on the
5479980	5484540	time their mum wouldn't bring them lunch, but as a pattern of behaviour it was toxic, and what Ruby
5484540	5488940	and Jodie did together will probably live with the effect of parties for the foreseeable future,
5488940	5493020	and that is a tragedy. The psychological justifications of such cruelty to those
5493020	5497500	vulnerable will likely take a long time to fully disentangle, to realise that actually this wasn't
5497500	5502140	their fault. Ruby Franky may not have entered parenthood with bad intentions, but her vanity
5502140	5506220	was corrupted by an online following and her failure to choose to actually put her family
5506220	5509900	first. To die on a hill that she had known for so long would eventually lead to one of the most
5509900	5514540	horrific outcomes, one whose legacy will remain long after she's forgotten by the internet.
5515100	5519660	The truth is that most people who end up doing pretty shitty things aren't born that way,
5519660	5523660	there are a lot of people out there who are just perpetuating a cycle that has been passed down
5523660	5528780	to them. Does it change the notion of accountability? Not necessarily, but it also
5528860	5533340	doesn't change the tragedy, that if they'd had a healthier upbringing they wouldn't have ended up
5533340	5538300	the way they were. People like Ruby risk maintaining the cycle, and if a child commits
5538300	5542060	something awful under the sort of duress that we know that Jodie and Ruby placed them under,
5542060	5546620	then that couple will also bear responsibility for those misdeeds as well. How are humans meant
5546620	5550940	to learn healthy relationships if all they've ever known is abuse? For a person who preached
5550940	5556300	responsibility, Ruby couldn't acknowledge any, that she ultimately had fallen far short.
5556300	5560700	I don't believe that she was always this way, but it's like driving a car towards an unfinished
5560700	5564700	bridge while everyone else is bailing out of it. Ruby smashed the accelerator.
5569500	5574300	Parenting isn't always an easy job, shout out to those who had very troubled childhoods, and
5574300	5579260	even early adulthoods as well. But parenting is a necessary job, sometimes the only constant you
5579260	5583980	have in your life is your family, they're integral to grounding a sense of self. I don't think there's
5583980	5587980	a one size fits all approach, and different solutions will work with different challenges,
5587980	5592380	but I do think navigating the exasperation of being a parent in those situations should never
5592380	5597100	manifest into resentment and vitriol, something which harsher systems can risk if not responded
5597100	5602540	well to. It's a cycle of punishment that will only beget harsher punishments. The Frankies went into
5602540	5606700	parenting with a perception of discipline that was more corporal and traditional, this is something
5606700	5611180	they agreed to and enforced together. This was also something they decided to partially document,
5611180	5614780	in the years after their channel was set up, they garnered a significant following of people
5614780	5619420	who admired their practices, capturing the good times, but showing parents, and aspiring parents
5619420	5623980	who may be a bit lost on handling troubled youngsters, a way forward. As the older sister,
5623980	5628380	her authority was affirmed as she grew to be the most influential channel in her family network,
5628380	5633260	and she gladly accepted the reigns as a reliable voice on parenting, yet all of this changed when
5633260	5636540	she decided to upload more information than people probably should have known.
5637340	5642540	Show that he was not able to manage himself sharing a bedroom with...
5642540	5647260	In the month after, Ruby partook in a campaign to defend her character against many who felt
5647260	5651340	that her authoritarian approach crossed a line, utilising unreasonable and disproportionate
5651340	5655580	punishment for what was at worst mild mischief. Judging from her language in responses and
5655580	5659260	interviews, she was winning the ideological battle in her mind, and that there were no
5659260	5663500	words that anyone else could say that could break that family. That may have well been true,
5663500	5667260	but as the eight passengers YouTube channel stagnated and began to lose subscribers,
5667260	5671340	there was a sign that people weren't completely happy with what the channel had presented. Ruby
5671340	5675820	and Kevin both seemed to lament this with great disdain, booing themselves as victims of cancel
5675820	5680300	culture over a year after the incident. It was clear that Ruby in particular still felt deeply
5680300	5685340	bitter about this. She was wronged online, and she needed to prove that she was right all along.
5685340	5690540	We are getting mentally fit the same way your body would get physically fit by running and
5690540	5696060	lifting weights and working with a personal trainer. We are getting ready to be your
5696060	5700780	mental fitness trainer. That's where connections came in. Headed by someone who believed we all
5700780	5704860	could have complete control over ourselves, Frankie's ideas surrounding parenting were
5704860	5709180	validated by a doctrine that showed you had to rescue your children from the distorted world
5709180	5713740	they were growing up in, that it wasn't her that was wrong, it was the world, it was the commentators,
5713740	5718380	it was her sisters, it was her oldest daughter, it was even her husband in the end. The Frankie's
5718380	5721980	went into parenting with a perception of discipline that was more corporal and traditional.
5721980	5726700	This is something they agreed to, but they emerged separate, a family broken apart by one person's
5726700	5731500	inability to change, at least for the better, a person who would rather be enabled than challenged.
5732060	5736460	Even then, with federal charges filed against her, sat in court, and facing down those her actions
5736460	5741500	had affected, it was still someone else's fault. For this time, it wasn't the viewers, it wasn't
5741500	5746460	the commenters, it wasn't the critics, it was the children, the children who made Ruby's child
5746460	5750300	possible in the first place, the children who viewers tuned in to watch, who likely didn't
5750300	5754540	receive a modicum of the millions that Ruby outwardly states she made. After being provided
5754540	5759660	by so much from her family, Ruby Frankie was ready to throw them under the school bus, an irony still
5759660	5764060	somewhat beyond comprehension, if there was a genuine human being who cared about anyone but
5764060	5769580	herself, they were buried very deep down. Ruby really was willing to lose everything for the
5769580	5775660	sake of being right, and she might well do, but nobody really wins, someone is losing a sister,
5775660	5779740	someone is losing a daughter, someone is losing a mother, but for many,
5780460	5784540	Ruby Frankie was already gone. So, what was left?
5794540	5799820	I think today is going to be one of those days I'm not a very good mom.
5799820	5803260	Regardless of the centres that Ruby receives in the following year, she will still likely live
5803260	5807820	another few decades to say the least, she will go on with her life, and hopefully not ruin any
5807820	5812220	others in the process. Everyone online will mostly move on, and her name will spark a sort of
5812220	5817180	reminiscence amongst internet culture enthusiasts. Nevertheless, even though her channels have been
5817180	5822140	deleted, the remnants of her philosophy, and the actions that philosophy led to, will live on.
5822140	5826940	Ironic that her channel originally created to compile fond family memories now only serves as
5826940	5831820	a highlight reel for Ruby's worst moments. It's hard to say whether this is a good thing or not,
5831820	5835980	some might say that YouTube served as important documentation for what will inevitably be used
5835980	5839820	to hold her accountable, but you could also say that she may have never reached that stage
5839820	5844140	if she hadn't made the decision to open the channel. I think one of the most harmful aspects
5844140	5848220	of a family channel is inevitably how it alters the family's trajectory in general,
5848220	5851980	particularly if the subjects of those videos aren't performative themselves.
5851980	5856860	8 Passengers was one of those channels, defined by the publication of intimate details with millions
5856860	5860860	watching. I don't think you can ever guarantee being entirely the same person when a camera
5860860	5866060	switched on, and having an on-camera and off-camera parent is not a healthy dynamic in my mind.
5866060	5870540	At least with acting, there is a clear distinction between what is real and what isn't. With this
5870540	5875180	sort of YouTube channel, how can a youngster tell which is the real parent and which isn't?
5875180	5883180	I totally ignored you today. Are you okay with that? Because you know I don't do it every day.
5883180	5889260	Do you think it's okay for mom to take care of herself for a day? Okay, thanks for being
5889260	5893820	thoughtful. Ruby Frankie was never a particularly good parent, it needs to be said,
5893820	5898140	reflecting on even the more pedestrian content she seems incredibly vain and full of herself
5898140	5902060	when it comes to the subject of raising children, and was never really open to alternative views
5902060	5905500	or methods that would probably have been much better for her family as a whole.
5905500	5910460	YouTube can't personality test people who decide to upload content, there has to be a degree of
5910460	5914380	personal responsibility to protect the freedoms of others, and although you wouldn't necessarily
5914380	5918620	say that YouTube makes a good person bad, the public attention it generates can definitely
5918620	5922860	corrupt an individual and exploit character flaws that make them more prone to behaving in
5922860	5926940	destructive ways. That's a pretty significant detail when dealing with channels that actively
5926940	5932380	feature vulnerable parties. With 8 Passengers, Ruby's vanity was fed by a viewership who admired
5932380	5936620	the couple's parenting, and thought they were seeing the results, perhaps even a way back for
5936620	5941420	them to the happy family that they desired. By 2019, the channel wasn't just a harmless memory
5941420	5945820	bank, it was a well-oiled commercial machine, but also a platform for Ruby to spread content
5945820	5950220	that in her mind was absolutely necessary for parents to see. This was her mission,
5950220	5954940	it regularly led to her uploading videos that in hindsight many felt were too invasive or revealing,
5954940	5959500	and they were, but this was her own personal crusade, it's how she gave her self-purpose.
5959500	5963660	She modelled the importance of her parenting on the view and sub-counts she acquired,
5963660	5967740	and for a while that validated her. However, like all Passengers perspectives, it wasn't a
5967740	5972140	criticism-free zone either, a lot of people raised issue with how she behaved in content and her
5972140	5976940	penal system, first surfacing after she sent her oldest son to Anasazi, but most famously emerging
5976940	5986220	when they spoke about her disciplinary system in a video. This was a double-edged sword as well,
5986220	5990620	because although people did the right thing and criticised it, with commentators being made aware
5990620	5995100	of something that could actually be scrutinised, it didn't aid the family relationship. This is not
5995100	5999340	the sort of thing that really should have been spoken about in a video uploaded to YouTube,
5999340	6003340	it's embarrassing for the son, but also not remotely useful for the mother. Really,
6003340	6007420	this is the sort of matter that should have been brought up in a private space where Ruby didn't
6007420	6011180	have to put on the front that YouTube required of her, because she wasn't going to listen to
6011180	6015660	people who didn't know those in her life from Adam. It's hard to say if there was anyone in
6015660	6019660	this world that Ruby would listen to who didn't agree with her, but there were definitely people
6019660	6023980	she wouldn't. However, just as YouTube was an ego-boost during the channel's viral era,
6023980	6028220	it's demise after this controversy would have put a significant dent in the ego of Frankie,
6028220	6031900	who in probably the most symptomatic turn of someone who felt their pride was under attack,
6031900	6036300	decided to create a platform entirely dedicated to defending her parenting practice and YouTube
6036300	6040940	channel under the cult backdrop, even replacing her family channel's Instagram with it. I can't
6040940	6044860	tell you how aware Ruby was of her own indoctrination, but it's occurrence was a
6044860	6049180	result of her not being able to stomach her own failure on a website that her self-worth as a
6049180	6053580	parent had become dangerously intertwined with, but her narcissism prevented her from taking
6053580	6054940	responsibility for.
6054940	6060220	Ruby- The power comes in the little things, and it's so fitting that I hit a million while I was
6060220	6064620	trying to squeeze in as many of those little things as I could.
6064620	6068540	It should go without saying, but a subscriber count or a view count is not a reflection of
6068540	6073740	your ability. Popularity and skill are not always correlated. In the case of Ruby Frankie,
6073740	6077900	her family generated popularity that she attributed to herself, but her subsequent
6077900	6081820	failure was something she could only blame on others. You can't point towards YouTube as being
6081820	6085660	responsible for that, but you do have to question how healthy that is for anyone, when the
6085660	6090700	consequences that mentality yields are only felt by those who don't have a say in it. It wasn't the
6090700	6095740	viewers, it wasn't the commenters, it wasn't the critics, it was the children, and just like she
6095740	6101180	blamed them in court, she likely blamed them at home as well. Ruby Frankie was a bad parent,
6101180	6106860	who only became worse over time and reminded some of us how fortunate we are, but she was also a
6106860	6111740	symptom of the morality of family content and the moral dubiousness that surrounds it. We may not
6111740	6116700	be able to ascertain the magnitude of the role her public status played in her eventual downward
6116700	6121020	spiral, but it's certainly a stark reminder that if you love the channel more than your children,
6121660	6125740	you probably shouldn't have either. Family channels. Needless to say,
6125740	6130060	they still haven't won me over quite yet. Thank you for watching.
6133100	6137660	Hey there guys, so that was the video, I hope you enjoyed it. Well, at least took something
6137660	6142300	away from it, maybe not the most enjoyable subject. I want to give a big thanks to the
6142300	6147100	editors, their names are up on the screen right now, and of course the wonderful people who've
6147100	6154140	helped me out post-editing, Kojak, fantastic work as always, Onuski on audio, and Starfo on
6154140	6159740	the thumbnails. Thank you again guys, your work is very much treasured and I really do appreciate it.

6180940	6184860	and if you wanna go and check out their work, then I encourage you to. I don't think there's
6184860	6191660	too much else to say, other than I hope you guys have a good Christmas, or break, or none of those
6191740	6195820	things, maybe you're not about second breaks, it's fine by me, whatever works for you,
6195820	6200460	and I hope 2023 has been good to you, but if not, I hope the next one's a bit better. Until then,
6200460	6204140	I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you, in the next one.
