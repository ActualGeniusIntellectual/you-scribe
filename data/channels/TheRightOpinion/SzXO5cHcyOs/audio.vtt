00:00.000 --> 00:15.320
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the right opinion, the home of a twat with

00:15.320 --> 00:19.020
too much free time, and family channels, they still haven't won me over quite yet.

00:19.020 --> 00:26.320
Whether it's the ACE family's exploitation of influencer status, the store for false

00:26.320 --> 00:29.760
enchantment surrounding adoption, or their former facade of faithfulness, there is a

00:29.760 --> 00:33.480
sense that the presence of cameras can corrupt one's perception of what a family means,

00:33.480 --> 00:36.700
and the honesty and values that would typically be shared behind closed doors.

00:36.700 --> 00:41.040
The only value that such channels will offer is as a guide to parents, and soon to be parents,

00:41.040 --> 00:45.520
who want to be the best they can be, sometimes as a template on how to practice parenting,

00:45.520 --> 00:47.680
and sometimes as a template on how not to.

00:47.680 --> 00:50.840
You'd still be within your rights to ask the question whether this trade-off is worth

00:50.840 --> 00:55.040
it for the broadcast of what is a very personal attachment during formative years, and if

00:55.040 --> 00:58.520
it would actually be more effective to seek guidance from professionals in the field.

00:58.520 --> 01:02.120
But if family channels are here to stay, let's hope they can provide some instruction for

01:02.120 --> 01:04.120
the next generation of parents.

01:04.120 --> 01:07.600
The truth is though that most channels in this genre are disinterested in serving that

01:07.600 --> 01:11.020
purpose, they're more there to entertain audience members, and although some may try

01:11.020 --> 01:14.900
to defend certain videos as edutainment, a lot of modern family channels just take a

01:14.900 --> 01:18.220
rather generic formula of content creation and add children.

01:18.220 --> 01:21.320
With that said, there are exceptions to this rule, couples and channels who do promote

01:21.320 --> 01:25.140
navigating challenges within their families, and either provide advice or insight into

01:25.140 --> 01:27.000
how certain issues are resolved.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
Of course, there is no one-size-fits-all manual on how to properly parent, and over the past

01:31.000 --> 01:34.680
century the brailing wisdom on how best to instill clear morals and values into the youth

01:34.680 --> 01:38.900
of today has evolved significantly, alongside our own morals and values, with many families

01:38.900 --> 01:42.440
from all over the world moving towards more moderate blueprints on discipline from within

01:42.440 --> 01:43.440
the family.

01:43.440 --> 01:46.640
This has received broad support from pediatric psychologists, although it's still been

01:46.640 --> 01:50.320
met with some resistance from people who feel that the traditional model worked on a practical

01:50.320 --> 01:54.280
basis for them, and therefore there's no reason for why they should deviate from it.

01:54.280 --> 01:57.860
With the opportunity for families from all backgrounds to broadcast themselves online,

01:57.860 --> 02:01.260
you are inevitably going to experience a wide pool of parenting techniques, some of which

02:01.260 --> 02:06.000
may lean towards the more traditional methods that resonate with the cohort of the population.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.800
At the same time, traditional parenting is a system that has needed to evolve as well,

02:09.800 --> 02:13.720
particularly given how aspects of that system, including physical reprimand, is now widely

02:13.720 --> 02:15.560
reviled and considered outdated.

02:15.560 --> 02:18.960
It's uncertain therefore whether it's more fitting or ironic that one of the most progressive

02:18.960 --> 02:23.160
places to video share has become a bastion for people promoting more traditional parenting

02:23.160 --> 02:27.000
styles, especially with the common narrative that today's youth are out of control.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.060
The truth is, though, that ultimately, regardless of what an expert might say, everyone is always

02:31.060 --> 02:34.320
going to have their own ideas of how to do something, and without the constraints of

02:34.320 --> 02:38.280
network approval or peer reviews, parents are free to share their own techniques on

02:38.280 --> 02:39.280
YouTube.

02:39.280 --> 02:41.480
But what does the modern form of traditional parenting look like?

02:41.480 --> 02:45.800
Well, for a few years towards the end of the 2010s, one individual thought she had it down

02:45.800 --> 02:47.060
to a T.

02:47.060 --> 02:51.400
So let's head on down to the wonderful state of Utah, to a mother of six and content creator

02:51.400 --> 02:52.980
by the name of Ruby Franky.

03:00.980 --> 03:05.060
Ruby Franky was the matriarch of the 8 Passengers YouTube channel, a channel which documented

03:05.060 --> 03:08.180
the rearing of her six children alongside her husband Kevin.

03:08.180 --> 03:11.780
This channel was launched in 2015 at a time where family channels were experiencing a

03:11.780 --> 03:14.300
lot of popularity on the video sharing platform.

03:14.420 --> 03:18.100
Although not becoming an overnight sensation, she steadily accrued over 2 million subscribers

03:18.100 --> 03:21.980
in the coming years, and found herself becoming a guiding light for many aspiring parents

03:21.980 --> 03:24.100
on the subject of how to raise children.

03:24.100 --> 03:27.620
Her techniques stem from a more traditional perspective that focused on punitive measures

03:27.620 --> 03:30.180
to teach her family the importance of responsibility.

03:30.180 --> 03:34.120
Her family were part of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as

03:34.120 --> 03:37.540
the Mormon Church, and although she didn't necessarily sing from the rooftops about it

03:37.540 --> 03:40.780
in her content, her faith clearly played an influential role in her life.

03:40.860 --> 03:44.340
Nevertheless, she was also a modern parent in how she promoted these techniques and explained

03:44.340 --> 03:48.380
her thought process, appearing more methodical and philosophical in her reflections on her

03:48.380 --> 03:52.460
actions, which her fans appeared to create some degree of understanding and respect,

03:52.460 --> 03:55.900
enshrining her as a millennial model for the traditionally minded mother.

04:10.780 --> 04:16.580
In spite of this, as her channel amplified its reach, she began to draw criticism for

04:16.580 --> 04:19.920
the treatment of her children, which often involved measures that many felt were extremely

04:19.920 --> 04:21.920
disproportionate to their actions.

04:21.920 --> 04:25.720
These measures often resulted in a deprivation of aspects to one's life that many would consider

04:25.720 --> 04:29.700
quite basic, and would widely be criticised as having an outwardly detrimental effect

04:29.700 --> 04:30.700
on their development.

04:40.780 --> 04:51.740
In spite of this, she would defend her parental technique due to its results, those being

04:51.740 --> 04:55.860
the perceived respect that her children demonstrated towards her in content and how it had seemingly

04:55.860 --> 04:57.980
resolved behavioural issues and challenges.

04:57.980 --> 05:02.280
Ultimately, from her and her husband's perspective, this style was conducive to a happy family,

05:02.280 --> 05:04.580
something they promoted on their channel to millions of viewers.

05:04.580 --> 05:09.100
If you wanted an operational family life, then this was the way, but what happens in

05:09.100 --> 05:12.140
front of the cameras is only ever a fragment of the full story.

05:12.140 --> 05:15.940
Yes, in the years that followed the spotlight being placed on her parental techniques from

05:15.940 --> 05:20.980
content creators, Ruby Franky's life began to implode quite spectacularly, with a disintegration

05:20.980 --> 05:25.620
of nearly everything that she knew, culminating in 2023 with the deletion of her remaining

05:25.620 --> 05:29.820
YouTube channels, alongside her arrest and detention, the judge deeming what she was

05:29.820 --> 05:32.900
accused of as too severe to even be granted bail.

05:32.900 --> 05:37.060
It seems that Ruby Franky didn't just possess a parental style, she was possessed by something

05:37.060 --> 05:42.300
far more sinister, and today we will be delving into that, and the consequences of those

05:42.300 --> 05:43.300
actions.

05:43.300 --> 05:47.220
I'll add that given the legal sensitivity and potential victimization of individuals,

05:47.220 --> 05:50.940
certain figures will be having their identities censored in this video, that information is

05:50.940 --> 05:53.980
not relevant to what I'll be discussing today regardless.

05:53.980 --> 06:00.100
So fellow internet friends and fiends, I suggest we examine the online remains of Ruby Franky,

06:00.660 --> 06:03.220
which is exactly what was really going on.

06:11.900 --> 06:15.940
On her YouTube channel, Ruby Franky was a mother, first and foremost.

06:15.940 --> 06:27.020
My house right now is a combination of smells of banana peel, wet diaper, and garbages that

06:27.940 --> 06:33.140
There was a fair bit more to her than initially met the eye.

06:33.140 --> 06:36.700
First of all, she was part of a significant vlogging syndicate with her wider family,

06:36.700 --> 06:39.780
all of whom had started somewhat successful channels themselves.

06:39.780 --> 06:43.700
Ruby had posted a couple videos onto YouTube over a decade ago, mostly grainy videos of

06:43.700 --> 06:46.860
her playing piano pieces, and an interesting upload about Chick-fil-A.

06:46.860 --> 07:09.140
There was some other content as well, but these were presented at the time as standalone

07:09.140 --> 07:10.140
uploads.

07:10.140 --> 07:13.220
In her description, she states that this is because she was already a happy mother of

07:13.220 --> 07:14.580
four wonderful children.

07:14.580 --> 07:18.020
Her sister Ellie had launched a couples channel with her husband Jared, in part to document

07:18.020 --> 07:21.380
their struggle of overcoming infertility, which was well received at the time.

07:21.380 --> 07:24.640
In the following years, each of the Franky siblings launched their own channels, Ruby

07:24.640 --> 07:25.940
being the last to do so.

07:25.940 --> 07:29.920
In spite of being the oldest and seemingly having a stable family life by this point,

07:29.920 --> 07:33.340
in an interview she gave approximately a year after beginning to upload on the video sharing

07:33.340 --> 07:36.940
platform, her rationale appeared to reflect a perspective that she wanted to live in the

07:36.940 --> 07:37.940
moment, stating,

07:44.580 --> 07:50.740
The channel therefore to her stood to serve as an archive of those happy family memories

07:50.740 --> 07:54.660
and milestones, something that you definitely received the impression of by watching a sample

07:54.660 --> 07:56.200
platter of her content.

07:56.200 --> 08:00.140
Now given the deletion of the 8 Passengers YouTube channel, we don't have a full catalogue

08:00.140 --> 08:03.960
of content available to us, but I selected a few videos that would hopefully give me

08:03.960 --> 08:07.620
and yourselves, if you choose, an insight into the family dynamics.

08:07.620 --> 08:10.820
On the one hand, it wasn't hard to see why the woman of the house had accrued a following.

08:10.820 --> 08:14.740
You guys, this is like a landmark in our family.

08:14.740 --> 08:16.660
Getting rid of the car seats is one.

08:16.660 --> 08:17.660
It's huge.

08:17.660 --> 08:18.780
Getting rid of car seats is huge.

08:18.780 --> 08:19.780
We're not quite there yet.

08:19.780 --> 08:21.340
We're still in booster seats.

08:21.340 --> 08:23.360
We're out of diapers.

08:23.360 --> 08:27.080
You guys, none of my kids had training wheels.

08:27.080 --> 08:30.140
Having children all at different stages in their life allowed her to show the diversity

08:30.140 --> 08:32.300
of experiences the raising them presented.

08:32.300 --> 08:35.760
It allowed her to demonstrate her abilities to navigate situations, while addressing her

08:35.760 --> 08:38.060
own shortcomings as a mother occasionally.

08:38.060 --> 08:39.940
The channel page would provide this impression.

08:39.940 --> 08:44.560
One popular series of videos advertised was the Sorry, Not Sorry, So Sorry, which accepted

08:44.560 --> 08:49.180
that in a family where no one is perfect, they all have to learn to say those two words.

08:49.180 --> 08:53.500
In content itself, Ruby's demeanour often presents itself as calm but also firm.

08:53.500 --> 08:57.100
You wouldn't necessarily receive an idea of her parental style from just randomly clicking

08:57.100 --> 08:58.100
on a video.

08:58.100 --> 09:01.540
She wasn't loud, she wasn't necessarily aggressive, she was obviously involved as

09:01.540 --> 09:05.400
parents went, but it didn't necessarily purport itself as overbearing.

09:05.400 --> 09:09.200
With that said, Ruby still had a narrative that she appeared to craft using her content,

09:09.200 --> 09:13.160
often making loaded statements to her children to seek agreement and validation from them,

09:13.160 --> 09:16.080
though not always specifically asking how they truly felt.

09:16.080 --> 09:19.760
I was talking to Daddy about you last night, and you know what we said?

09:19.760 --> 09:20.760
What?

09:20.760 --> 09:26.080
How much we are just amazed by you and your love of learning.

09:26.080 --> 09:29.480
You do it because you love to learn, don't you?

09:29.480 --> 09:32.440
It's not about grades for you, is it?

09:32.440 --> 09:33.440
It's all about...

09:33.440 --> 09:34.440
Sort of?

09:34.480 --> 09:37.400
You enjoy it, I can tell, I'm very proud of you.

09:37.400 --> 09:40.680
It's clear that she wanted herself and her children to be perceived a certain way by

09:40.680 --> 09:44.400
the audience, perhaps as a reflection on her own parenting abilities, something that was

09:44.400 --> 09:46.720
always prone to public scrutiny as a content creator.

09:46.720 --> 09:51.160
In a world of far more avaricious channels who exploited drama and conflict, Eight Passengers

09:51.160 --> 09:55.420
often avoided conflict by simply choosing not to focus on those parts of their lives.

09:55.420 --> 09:59.160
The reason that Ruby Frankie's sentiments often flew under the radar is because it was

09:59.160 --> 10:04.300
not the centerpiece of her content, many unassuming viewers simply would not notice anything unreasonable

10:04.300 --> 10:08.360
about her demeanor a majority of the time, and she would often seek to avoid publicizing

10:08.360 --> 10:09.960
that side of her completely.

10:09.960 --> 10:13.320
She laid down boundaries regarding what the child would document, stating that certain

10:13.320 --> 10:15.980
conversations would be dealt with off-camera.

10:15.980 --> 10:17.500
What do you think about it?

10:17.500 --> 10:20.340
Well, we'll discuss it when we get home.

10:20.340 --> 10:21.340
I know, yeah, I saw the text.

10:21.340 --> 10:24.100
It's not something I want to discuss on the vlog.

10:24.100 --> 10:25.100
Why?

10:26.100 --> 10:35.900
Because it involves behaviour, attitude, and consequences, which we don't tend to vlog very much.

10:35.900 --> 10:40.060
These often related to possible emotional challenges and disciplinary measures.

10:40.060 --> 10:43.440
Ruby made the active decision to often keep these potentially sensitive discussions off

10:43.440 --> 10:47.020
the channel, for some that would be a reasonable decision as the presence of a video camera

10:47.020 --> 10:51.580
could very easily influence how two people interact, however it also might prompt a discerning

10:51.580 --> 10:55.300
audience member to wonder exactly what those conversations entailed.

10:55.300 --> 10:59.700
The glimpses we did receive into Ruby's message definitely appear to lean into austerity.

10:59.700 --> 11:03.060
One such measure that jumped out was when one of her daughters went through a manicure

11:03.060 --> 11:07.780
kit, making a mess on the floor and carpet, before hiding under the bed, likely out of

11:07.780 --> 11:08.780
embarrassment.

11:08.780 --> 11:11.980
Although visibly bothered, Ruby doesn't seem enraged, nonetheless, her punishment

11:11.980 --> 11:15.860
of denying her nail painting services to said daughter for the following month would definitely

11:15.860 --> 11:19.820
strike some parents as quite strict, especially as Ruby says that it's her daughter's

11:19.820 --> 11:20.820
favourite activity.

11:20.940 --> 11:24.340
However, the daughter seems to accept this, and there's no apparent bad blood on camera.

11:24.340 --> 11:29.060
You're still going to have the consequence of not having your nails done for a month.

11:29.060 --> 11:31.060
Do you understand that?

11:31.060 --> 11:32.060
Yes.

11:32.060 --> 11:38.780
And I still, I still want to buy you one of the another rugs.

11:38.780 --> 11:41.980
You still want to buy me a new rug?

11:41.980 --> 11:44.980
Maybe you can do some extra chores to help with the money.

11:44.980 --> 11:45.980
Um, Mom.

11:45.980 --> 11:46.980
It's a deal.

11:46.980 --> 11:47.980
Give me a hug.

11:47.980 --> 11:48.980
Um, Mom.

11:48.980 --> 11:52.460
It appeared that Ruby valued accountability and consequence.

11:52.460 --> 11:55.300
She wanted to make sure that her children were aware of these tenets, and she wasn't

11:55.300 --> 11:57.300
the only person who appreciated that.

11:57.300 --> 12:01.820
Yes, despite launching her channel after those of her sisters, by 2020, 8 Passengers was

12:01.820 --> 12:05.140
the most subscribed channel out of Frankie's entire family.

12:05.140 --> 12:08.700
Ruby's tough love model of parenting had resonated with a variety of people, and although

12:08.700 --> 12:12.420
the punishment may strike some as harsh, there often wasn't a great level of discourse

12:12.420 --> 12:13.420
on it.

12:13.420 --> 12:16.680
The truth was that 8 Passengers harvested a strong view count with established sponsors

12:16.680 --> 12:18.580
for a majority of their lifespan.

12:18.580 --> 12:27.500
Um, 999,999, and then it jumped straight to a million and 5, and then 6, by the time

12:27.500 --> 12:32.740
I got to look down it was like a million and 10, oh my gosh.

12:32.740 --> 12:37.460
In spite of their success though, come 2020, the family channel heyday had mostly passed,

12:37.460 --> 12:41.220
with a lot of 8 Passengers content only receiving a few hundred thousand views per video.

12:41.220 --> 12:44.820
If anything, they'd survived the viral stage of their career, and were moving into a more

12:44.820 --> 12:48.460
perhaps low-key era, where they would be able to focus on holding on to the law of

12:48.460 --> 12:51.460
viewership and perhaps experimenting a little with content.

12:51.460 --> 12:55.360
However, there are certainly limits to that experimentation, and although setting down

12:55.360 --> 12:59.620
boundaries for what was enforced on and off camera, Ruby Franky was about to be a bit

12:59.620 --> 13:02.340
too frank with her audience.

13:02.340 --> 13:03.340
How would that happen?

13:03.340 --> 13:04.340
Well.

13:17.940 --> 13:22.100
There's an unpredictability about parenting, there are many ways that one can prepare to

13:22.100 --> 13:25.100
raise a child, and help support them to be the best versions of themselves.

13:25.100 --> 13:29.020
At the same time, there are always factors that one cannot control, be them outside the

13:29.020 --> 13:31.940
parenting sphere, or be them within the child themselves.

13:31.940 --> 13:35.620
Some people are not blessed with balanced chemicals within the brain, and that can cultivate

13:35.620 --> 13:37.380
conflict during their development.

13:37.380 --> 13:41.060
In the Franky family, this appeared to be the most conspicuous with their oldest son,

13:41.060 --> 13:44.340
who although appearing rather mild-mannered throughout much of their content, was reported

13:44.340 --> 13:48.580
by Ruby and Kevin to be experiencing some issues, which resulted in a suspension.

13:48.580 --> 13:51.540
This incident appears to be alluded to in the earlier clip that I showed, where Ruby

13:51.540 --> 13:55.260
stated that she felt this was not a discussion for the camera, however approximately half

13:55.260 --> 13:59.500
a year after his suspension, Ruby's oldest son vanished from content on the channel altogether,

13:59.500 --> 14:03.820
and although I doubt anyone assumed the worst, some people likely did ask some questions.

14:03.820 --> 14:07.740
These questions would be answered at the end of 2019, where the Frankys go into more detail

14:07.740 --> 14:11.660
surrounding their attempts to set their son on the right path, explaining over sentimental

14:11.660 --> 14:15.340
acoustic music that they had decided to send him to a corrective course.

14:15.340 --> 14:21.700
We debated whether we should talk to the viewers about what's been going on.

14:21.700 --> 14:28.060
We wanted to do the right thing, so we got a lot of opinions from a lot of adults.

14:28.060 --> 14:30.220
Who did this corrective course entail, exactly?

14:30.220 --> 14:34.780
Well, it's our old friend, the Wilderness Camp, to be particular, the Anasazi Wilderness

14:34.780 --> 14:36.300
Camp in Mesa, Arizona.

14:37.500 --> 14:46.300
Today has just entered the Anasazi Foundation wilderness therapy program, where he's going

14:46.300 --> 14:55.020
to spend the next eight to ten weeks living in the Anasazi desert, the desert mountains

14:55.020 --> 14:56.020
of Arizona.

14:56.180 --> 14:59.460
Now, I've already spoken in part about the concerns surrounding wilderness therapy in

14:59.460 --> 15:03.940
my Dr Phil video, but generally I'm not an enthusiastic advocate for that form of treatment.

15:03.940 --> 15:08.500
With that said, Anasazi is not Turnabout Ranch, and there are many issues related to Turnabout

15:08.500 --> 15:12.500
Ranch that were independent from the concerns relating to wilderness therapy as a whole.

15:12.500 --> 15:16.340
Although Kevin and Ruby are more revealing than they may usually be in this video, they

15:16.340 --> 15:20.100
also still refrain from indulging details regarding their son's behaviour, stating that

15:20.100 --> 15:22.260
it's been an ongoing issue outside the channel.

15:22.980 --> 15:29.220
It's an accumulation of things over years, well before we ever started YouTubing, or

15:29.220 --> 15:36.100
well before we ever got into social media, and it's reached a point where he needs to

15:36.100 --> 15:42.180
develop some very basic maturity and skills that he's going to need as an adult.

15:42.180 --> 15:45.700
One can't help but wonder whether if this was a problem before the issue channel, then

15:45.700 --> 15:49.300
they should have been addressed before setting up a media account on a public platform, but

15:49.380 --> 15:52.420
if that's how they decide to go about it, then so be it.

15:52.420 --> 15:56.020
Although this upload likely drew skepticism from individuals who felt these camps were

15:56.020 --> 15:59.940
detrimental, the Frankie's had already made up their mind, and despite hesitancy to talk

15:59.940 --> 16:03.380
about it at first, over the coming months they continue to report on their son's progress

16:03.380 --> 16:06.420
favourably, pulling some of the highest view counts of the year for their channel.

16:06.420 --> 16:10.500
Their son returns home to a fanfare from his family, and in the coming months is heralded

16:10.500 --> 16:11.780
as a resounding success.

16:19.300 --> 16:25.700
It seems that wilderness therapy had worked this time, and Ruby's son was on his way

16:25.700 --> 16:28.020
to becoming an upstanding citizen of society.

16:28.020 --> 16:31.700
The next half year passed without a major family incident, they moved house, and formed

16:31.700 --> 16:36.180
a united family front during the first cold months of the coronavirus pandemic, even chronicling

16:36.180 --> 16:38.980
their response to the 2020 Salt Lake City earthquake.

16:38.980 --> 16:43.140
It was safe to say there wasn't a scarcity in subjects and experiences to cover.

16:43.140 --> 16:47.460
At the same time, having all the children home at once was obviously a great responsibility

16:47.460 --> 16:51.460
on anyone, and many of those youngsters who were used to actually going outside on a regular

16:51.460 --> 16:56.340
basis found the restrictions to cause a great restlessness, and restlessness can beget acting

16:56.340 --> 17:00.740
out, and in one video at the end of May entitled What We Haven't Told You, Ruby reveals that

17:00.740 --> 17:05.140
while herself and her husband were away at a retreat, the rules they set regarding allocated

17:05.140 --> 17:08.020
use of technology had been breached by two family members.

17:08.020 --> 17:11.940
She was obviously not thrilled by this information, and decided to be more vocal than usual on

17:11.940 --> 17:15.780
the punishment that she deemed appropriate for these shenanigans, stating that electronic

17:15.780 --> 17:19.060
items in the house would be banned for the coming summer, though this doesn't really

17:19.060 --> 17:21.380
have to do with what they didn't tell us, does it?

17:21.380 --> 17:25.700
Well, let's reintroduce her oldest son, who Ruby encourages to share his own personal

17:25.700 --> 17:29.780
experience with the punitive measures imposed by his mother, which included the confiscation

17:29.780 --> 17:31.620
of his electronic items as well.

17:31.620 --> 17:36.420
Ruby- Every day I would wake up around 5am, and I would go and do my daily thinking in

17:36.420 --> 17:42.340
front of that safe full of all my electronics, like the Xbox, and the iPads, and all the

17:42.340 --> 17:49.700
iPhones, and the laptops, and the TV remotes, you even locked up the TV remotes, because

17:49.700 --> 17:51.380
you locked them up for the entire summer.

17:51.380 --> 17:55.060
We assume that this refers back to his past behavioural issues, and although some would

17:55.060 --> 17:58.820
deem it rather strict, some would still argue that many of these devices are not items they

17:58.820 --> 18:02.740
were necessarily entitled to, he at least still had the opportunity to hang out with

18:02.740 --> 18:04.580
his friends and socialise in other ways.

18:04.580 --> 18:08.180
This was already more information than many viewers were privy to usually, but the video

18:08.180 --> 18:12.500
then takes a stranger turn with Ruby herself as the parent asking her son if he thinks

18:12.500 --> 18:14.340
that she should confiscate the TV.

18:14.340 --> 18:18.660
He responds saying that he was under the impression that she was doing so already, with Ruby's

18:18.660 --> 18:21.460
response to be accusing him of quote, telling stories.

18:21.460 --> 18:23.620
Ruby- You think you're reading my mind, and I'm-

18:23.620 --> 18:25.540
Ruby- That's a story?

18:26.580 --> 18:27.460
Storytelling?

18:27.700 --> 18:29.380
Okay, fine, then take away TV from me.

18:30.900 --> 18:32.820
Is that what you would suggest?

18:32.820 --> 18:37.780
Sure, unless it's like a family movie, because I see him all the time watching Netflix.

18:37.780 --> 18:42.260
Her son eventually concedes and says that he thinks it's a good idea, and although I'm

18:42.260 --> 18:47.140
in favour of more democracy, it seems a very intriguing time to shirk one's parental responsibility.

18:47.140 --> 18:50.900
We then cut to her divulging more information about how she confiscated her daughter's

18:50.900 --> 18:54.340
phone, and what those punishments represented to her as a parent.

18:54.340 --> 19:00.580
So, in our house, we, when we take something away, it's because they have shown that they

19:00.580 --> 19:03.540
are not responsible enough to manage it.

19:03.540 --> 19:07.220
Although none of her diatribe felt completely unfathomable, her narratives were beginning

19:07.220 --> 19:11.700
to feel a little defensive and unnecessary, with strange rules that I'm not even sure

19:11.700 --> 19:13.860
anyone knew existed until this video.

19:13.860 --> 19:19.140
It has to be consistent over a minimum, minimum of six months, and that-

19:19.140 --> 19:24.740
One of the consequences is she will not be getting her nails painted for a solid month.

19:24.740 --> 19:28.820
It was clear that this conversation was moving into new territory, but few could have been

19:28.820 --> 19:31.460
prepared for the bombshell that was about to be dropped.

19:31.460 --> 19:33.780
I don't think our viewers know that.

19:33.780 --> 19:35.140
Not even Ruby.

19:45.540 --> 19:48.900
Up to this point, you could easily question Ruby's disciplinary decisions,

19:48.900 --> 19:52.580
but there was no catalyst for the sort of public attention that such methods could draw.

19:52.580 --> 19:56.340
However, when discussing this six-month rule, her oldest son reveals that he had been without

19:56.340 --> 19:58.420
a bed for a full seven months.

19:59.140 --> 20:03.300
My bedroom was taken away for seven months, and then you give it back like a couple weeks ago.

20:03.300 --> 20:04.660
I've been sleeping on a beanbag.

20:04.660 --> 20:09.540
I've been sleeping on a beanbag since October, and they gave me my broom back like two weeks ago.

20:09.540 --> 20:10.740
What was the reason for this?

20:10.740 --> 20:15.220
That I woke up at two in the morning and told him that we're going to Disneyland and he

20:15.220 --> 20:19.620
has to pack, and he got up and made his bed all neatly and then packed all his clothes

20:19.620 --> 20:23.700
in the suitcase, and then he walked out the door and he's like, why?

20:23.700 --> 20:28.740
And he's all happy, has his sunglasses on, and I was like, we're not going to Disneyland.

20:28.740 --> 20:31.860
Well, it appears that the oldest son played a prank on his younger brother,

20:31.860 --> 20:35.780
waking up at an ungodly hour and telling him that they were going to Disneyland, when in fact,

20:35.780 --> 20:36.580
they were not.

20:36.580 --> 20:40.740
This inevitably led to a lot of disappointment, and does seem like a rather cruel joke.

20:40.740 --> 20:44.660
Ruby clarifies, though, that this was not the only issue, more so a final straw as he admits

20:44.660 --> 20:46.980
he had been tormenting his sibling in other ways as well,

20:46.980 --> 20:49.460
including on the day that he came back from wilderness therapy.

20:49.460 --> 20:54.260
Ruby- When he began at his face and hung him on the basketball.

20:58.580 --> 21:01.060
Ruby- Basically, basically...

21:01.060 --> 21:03.300
Ruby- The day I got home, too.

21:04.180 --> 21:08.020
However, although you could argue that demonstrated a potential issue in sharing a bedroom with a

21:08.020 --> 21:12.340
sibling, few could see how forcing the son to sleep on a beanbag for seven months was a

21:12.340 --> 21:14.900
just and proportionate punishment for such hijinks.

21:14.900 --> 21:17.300
If you believe that two people can't share a bedroom between them,

21:17.300 --> 21:21.540
then you need to take adequate measures to ensure that each party at least has a bed available.

21:21.540 --> 21:24.500
Ruby's point isn't aided when it's revealed that since moving house,

21:24.500 --> 21:26.580
they've actually had a whole bedroom available,

21:26.580 --> 21:30.420
they just didn't allow their son to move into it due to the past incidents.

21:30.420 --> 21:34.180
Outside of these details, Ruby's own response was somewhat indicative as well,

21:34.180 --> 21:37.940
forcing out a nervous chuckle while observing that this was new information to the audience.

21:37.940 --> 21:40.980
It would be easy to cut the recording here and edit out this discussion,

21:40.980 --> 21:42.900
like I'm sure she had many times before.

21:42.900 --> 21:44.900
But after her son had explained the predicament,

21:44.900 --> 21:47.540
she decides that actually there was a point to be made.

21:47.540 --> 21:48.980
What would her explanation be?

21:48.980 --> 21:54.900
Ruby- Showed that he was not able to manage himself sharing a bedroom with...

21:54.900 --> 22:01.380
Chad- So when we moved, um, the bigger room in the basement was automatically his,

22:01.380 --> 22:02.500
and I didn't have a room.

22:02.500 --> 22:07.620
Ruby- So a lot of you are like, hey, that's not fair because got the bigger,

22:07.620 --> 22:10.260
the lesser bedroom and got the bigger bedroom.

22:10.340 --> 22:12.100
Chad- The smaller bedroom.

22:12.100 --> 22:17.780
Ruby- Got the big bedroom and got the smaller bedroom and the bigger bedroom also had a bathroom.

22:17.780 --> 22:21.540
But what you guys didn't know was you didn't get any room.

22:21.540 --> 22:23.380
Well, honestly, not really much.

22:23.380 --> 22:27.700
Once again, it seems more like a problem of coexistence rather than a problem of having

22:27.700 --> 22:31.380
a bedroom. In a way, sometimes giving people a private space would be more helpful than

22:31.380 --> 22:32.420
depriving them of it.

22:32.420 --> 22:36.180
Although it feels like none of those in the video feel the punishment was proportionate,

22:36.180 --> 22:40.180
even spending a fair amount of time laughing about the incidents, they still accept it.

22:40.660 --> 22:44.180
The video only becomes more depressing by the minute, with both the kids she was filming

22:44.180 --> 22:47.460
with stating that they have no friends at all, so they can't even hang out with them

22:47.460 --> 22:48.260
for the summer.

22:48.260 --> 22:52.260
Although Ruby expresses some form of sympathy, she doesn't seem particularly motivated to

22:52.260 --> 22:56.100
do much about it, more just thinking about how it's perceived by the viewers.

22:56.100 --> 22:56.980
Ruby- You can play with friends.

22:56.980 --> 22:58.420
Chad- No, like I don't have friends.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.380
Ruby- I don't have friends either.

22:59.380 --> 23:02.420
Chad- I literally like told my friends I'm not hanging out with them anymore.

23:02.420 --> 23:03.300
Ruby- See, because they're-

23:03.300 --> 23:05.220
Chad- They say some pretty messed up stuff.

23:05.220 --> 23:08.100
Ruby- How do you feel about not having any friends?

23:08.900 --> 23:15.540
Chad- Sucks, but I don't feel safe or accepted in any friend group, so.

23:15.540 --> 23:20.980
Ruby- That's really vulnerable of you to say that on camera, because you don't have to

23:20.980 --> 23:21.700
film that.

23:21.700 --> 23:23.860
No Ruby, you do not have to film that.

23:24.740 --> 23:26.260
And yet, you did.

23:26.260 --> 23:30.100
Still amongst this all, Ruby takes the time to make sure everyone knows how hard it's

23:30.100 --> 23:33.780
been on her, though I'm not sure her son was completely buying it.

23:34.260 --> 23:39.860
Look, when you make these choices with your family to take things away as a parent, you

23:39.860 --> 23:45.300
really do want them to have these things, and it's been so, so, so difficult to take

23:45.300 --> 23:50.900
a phone away, to take a bedroom away, to take iPads away, to take access away.

23:50.900 --> 23:56.180
Like, it hurts me just as much as it hurts my kids.

23:56.180 --> 24:00.020
Although the video finishes on a somewhat lighter note with Ruby finding some middle

24:00.020 --> 24:03.700
ground with her younger son, people had already seen enough and began to call her out for

24:03.700 --> 24:06.020
depriving her son of a bedroom and a bed.

24:06.020 --> 24:10.260
This began on social media, with some using the clip and letting Ruby and Kevin know that

24:10.260 --> 24:13.540
they were not happy, that Frankie seemed to be aware of this negative response because

24:13.540 --> 24:16.340
the video was deleted within the first couple days following upload.

24:16.340 --> 24:20.500
However, as people began to re-upload it and comments were able to be left below, it became

24:20.500 --> 24:25.220
clear how many were not simply going to let this slide, with content creators soon providing

24:25.220 --> 24:26.580
their input as well.

24:26.580 --> 24:33.060
The video is titled, What We Haven't Told You, and in this video, her eldest son details

24:33.140 --> 24:39.780
that he has not been sleeping in a bed, let alone a bedroom, in the past seven months.

24:39.780 --> 24:44.500
But I just feel like as a punishment for pranking his brother should have just been like him

24:44.500 --> 24:49.700
hanging out with his brother more, but, you know, this is an extreme form of parenting

24:49.700 --> 24:50.100
here.

24:50.100 --> 24:54.500
When a clip like this goes viral, many look towards the rest of a creator's body of content

24:54.500 --> 24:58.420
to see if there were any other incidents that could signify a clear pattern of behaviour,

24:58.420 --> 25:02.580
and like clockwork they did, with many netizens unearthing older video excerpts where they

25:02.580 --> 25:04.900
felt she had gone too far in her parental approach.

25:04.900 --> 25:08.820
Outside of publishing very revealing details and moments that many felt breached their

25:08.820 --> 25:12.900
individual privacy, clips of her disciplinary measures included threatening to forfeit her

25:12.900 --> 25:16.740
son's dinners if they continued play fighting, even though it was quite apparent it was in

25:16.740 --> 25:20.900
jest, refusing to supply her six-year-old daughter with any additional sustenance after

25:20.900 --> 25:24.660
she forgot to make herself lunch, threatening to behead her daughter's fluffy toy as she

25:24.660 --> 25:28.580
continued to act out with these scissors, and this one where she's in her best Miranda

25:28.580 --> 25:29.460
Sings cosplay.

25:38.900 --> 25:43.540
Those few clips in particular picked up traction because they just seemed unnecessarily harsh

25:43.540 --> 25:44.980
without any real motive.

25:44.980 --> 25:49.620
People forget things, people muck around, especially when they're young, Ruby was and

25:49.620 --> 25:52.980
is no exception, and to preach that a six-year-old needs to go hungry or else she won't learn

25:52.980 --> 25:56.900
to make her own lunch is just an unreasonably cynical perspective, especially given that

25:56.900 --> 25:59.540
as far as we know it was the first time that this had occurred.

25:59.540 --> 26:03.460
When you put all of the incriminating clips together, they create a pretty damning portrait

26:03.460 --> 26:07.380
of the sort of household that Ruby Franky was operating, and many felt at that point

26:07.380 --> 26:11.380
she was already unfit to be a parent, with an individual launching a change.org petition

26:11.380 --> 26:15.780
to have CPS investigate the parents, and to ensure the safety of all those involved.

26:16.340 --> 26:20.580
This was escalating very quickly, with many clips painting the parents in a very unflattering

26:20.580 --> 26:24.420
light, however there were always two sides to the story, and the Frankys were gearing

26:24.420 --> 26:25.540
up to present their own.

26:26.340 --> 26:27.540
What would they say?

26:27.540 --> 26:32.340
Ruby Franky-"I'm going to do a video and post it tomorrow, but I think I'm just gonna do it right now."

26:39.300 --> 26:43.700
As noted, in spite of their content not exactly inviting people to make their voices heard,

26:43.700 --> 26:47.940
the Frankys were extremely sensitive to audience response, and removed their upload nearly as soon

26:47.940 --> 26:52.260
as they began to sense negative feedback, very shortly after Ruby took to Instagram Stories

26:52.260 --> 26:54.260
to address the criticism directed at her.

26:54.260 --> 26:59.300
Ruby Franky-"I'm going to, um, I'm gonna post tomorrow. I don't normally post on Saturdays,

27:00.420 --> 27:06.820
and I would love to validate all of your anger, and to let you know that I hear you,

27:07.540 --> 27:10.900
and I understand why you're upset."

27:11.540 --> 27:15.060
The first clip onto her Instagram acknowledges the feedback, and commits to responding the

27:15.060 --> 27:19.060
following day. It's slightly hard to interpret how she feels about it, although she is vocal

27:19.060 --> 27:23.220
in stating that the people expressing their concern are heard. Her tone is marked by an

27:23.220 --> 27:27.060
undercurrent of disdain, particularly when referencing people who have sent her messages,

27:27.060 --> 27:28.900
many of which she claims are supportive.

27:29.780 --> 27:33.860
Ruby Franky-"It's always so interesting when things go black and white.

27:33.860 --> 27:38.100
Not everything goes black and white, but every once in a while there's a post where

27:38.980 --> 27:45.620
you either really hate what you've heard, and that's usually what fills up in the comments,

27:45.620 --> 27:51.140
and then it's in the DMs where people don't want to be attacked for giving support,

27:51.140 --> 28:00.260
which I totally get, but I've gotten a lot of support in the DMs, so for that, I thank you."

28:00.900 --> 28:04.660
However, six hours later, with the situation clearly ballooning online, Ruby changed her

28:04.660 --> 28:08.820
mind and decides to tackle it once more on her Instagram story, appearing in the car with her

28:08.820 --> 28:12.900
husband Kevin, for a ten minute statement which explains the rationale behind her controversial

28:12.900 --> 28:19.220
upload. Ruby Franky-"I didn't anticipate all the upset, however, listening to all of your comments

28:19.220 --> 28:26.820
and your feedback and your feelings around things, it totally makes sense to me why you're

28:26.820 --> 28:31.460
angry and why you're upset." She explains that she was surprised that the son has spoken about all

28:31.460 --> 28:35.780
the quote outcomes of his behaviour, and had repeatedly reassured him that she was happy to

28:35.780 --> 28:40.340
cut it from the upload, an offer which her son declined, stating that this should be uploaded.

28:40.340 --> 28:44.180
However, in hindsight, she can see why the content was upsetting for certain viewers.

28:44.180 --> 28:47.620
This is where Kevin chimes in, expressing sympathy towards the viewer's perspective,

28:47.620 --> 28:50.900
but also going into detail about their son's background, and why they felt,

28:50.900 --> 28:55.220
after consultation with professionals, the sanction imposed on their son was justified.

28:55.220 --> 29:00.260
Kevin-"Long before we started YouTube, there were a lot of behavioural and emotional challenges that

29:00.260 --> 29:05.540
we were dealing with with our kids, and we've been consulting with mental health and emotional

29:05.540 --> 29:12.420
health professionals for years. And the things that we show and share, and the things that

29:12.420 --> 29:18.500
many of you are criticizing and calling abusive, are actually things that mental health professionals

29:18.500 --> 29:24.100
have counseled us to do." There are pudiate claims that this sort of treatment could ever be labelled

29:24.100 --> 29:27.540
as abuse, with Ruby stating that although she would agree that parents who deprived their

29:27.540 --> 29:31.860
children of beds could be classified as such, she hasn't done this for fun, from her perspective,

29:31.860 --> 29:35.140
this was a warranted forfeiture, and that was something that had also been enforced at the

29:35.140 --> 29:39.300
Anasazi camp. This was all in line with her parenting style, and she wasn't fazed by the

29:39.300 --> 29:43.700
accusations as she'd experienced them before, and considers those accusing her this time as

29:43.700 --> 29:49.540
uninformed as any of those prior detractors. Ruby-"We got accused of child abuse when we sent

29:49.540 --> 29:58.180
to Anasazi. Guess what? The first thing that they did was take a bed away. They don't have beds,

29:59.140 --> 30:05.300
so slept on the hard ground for months, and it's, you know, it's run by psychologists and therapists,

30:06.020 --> 30:12.980
and if not having a bed was psychologically damaging, then they wouldn't have suggested that."

30:12.980 --> 30:16.180
She states that the bottom line is this is how they parent. They receive a lot of comments

30:16.180 --> 30:20.100
wondering how their children are so well behaved, and the results are there on the YouTube channel

30:20.100 --> 30:24.180
for anyone to actually see. Kevin and Ruby then accuse many of those criticizing them for

30:24.180 --> 30:29.140
projecting their own experiences onto them. Ruby-"And so if you are triggered, and you're upset

30:29.140 --> 30:36.660
because of something Kevin and I have done with our children that is actually working really well

30:37.300 --> 30:45.860
for us, then I would invite you to look at it and ask yourself what is it that I'm projecting

30:45.860 --> 30:51.700
onto this situation, because you would be upset, and you would be angry if I was your mom doing

30:51.700 --> 30:56.420
this to you." The next five minutes are a mix of dollar store psychoanalysis of those attacking

30:56.420 --> 30:59.860
them, and a variety of further disorganized thoughts on the matter. I don't really have

30:59.860 --> 31:03.540
too much to add here, it should be clear by now that their line of response was to acknowledge

31:03.540 --> 31:07.140
those who may be concerned, and attempt to show that they were listening, but also dismiss

31:07.140 --> 31:10.900
accusations implying that people were not adequately informed or familiar with the relevant

31:10.900 --> 31:14.820
context to actually appreciate these methods of parenting. This response was not received well,

31:14.820 --> 31:18.420
with many feeling that the Frankies were trying to shift the responsibility of interpreting the

31:18.420 --> 31:22.900
situation onto anyone but themselves. Paired with the unravelling allegations regarding other clips

31:22.900 --> 31:26.420
they had posted on their channel, they decided to continue uploading content while ignoring

31:26.420 --> 31:30.180
the criticism. One of their next uploads though was announcing their son's new room,

31:30.180 --> 31:33.940
this was to be expected as they had done this before for other siblings, but it wasn't really

31:33.940 --> 31:37.300
a good time to post this, and although people couldn't voice their thoughts as the comments

31:37.300 --> 31:41.060
were turned off, the like to dislike ratio reflected a still present eye towards the

31:41.060 --> 31:45.620
embattled family channel. However, in spite of the criticism, no platform seemed inclined to act in

31:45.620 --> 31:49.460
the moment, the petition ultimately went nowhere, and although it was reported they had received a

31:49.460 --> 31:53.940
visit from CPS, this case was also closed pretty quickly. In the weeks after granting their son a

31:53.940 --> 31:58.660
new bedroom, and with the storm clouds on their way out, the Frankies began to fight back finally,

31:58.660 --> 32:02.740
firstly issuing cease and desist letters to many YouTubers who had in their opinion posted

32:02.740 --> 32:07.460
defamatory content. Further this, they issued one more response to the media website, Insider,

32:07.460 --> 32:12.420
though not entirely unopposed, the title framing these YouTubers as speaking out is certainly an

32:12.420 --> 32:17.060
interesting choice. The article briefly recapped the situation before going over the perspective

32:17.060 --> 32:21.380
of how many felt this punishment was harsh, and even drafting in multiple psychological experts

32:21.380 --> 32:26.180
to explain how harsh punishments affect the mental development of youngsters, even having one explain

32:26.180 --> 32:30.420
why seizing a bed would be extremely upsetting, seemingly setting up some quite strong criticism

32:30.420 --> 32:34.980
of the Frankies. They respond however by stating that they actually never chose to forfeit their

32:34.980 --> 32:39.220
son a bed, they gave him a choice on the matter, and that he was offered a guest bed and an

32:39.220 --> 32:43.620
inflatable mattress as well, they were just separating the siblings as recommended by their

32:43.620 --> 32:47.460
own psychologists. Ruby insists that they are teaching their children to be self-governing,

32:47.460 --> 32:51.620
and that their son chose the bean bag because it was the most comfortable to him, and in spite of

32:51.620 --> 32:55.780
her previously stated six-month rule, her son could have actually had the new bedroom at any

32:55.780 --> 33:00.340
point his behaviour changed, it just happened to take seven months for him to make that choice.

33:00.340 --> 33:06.180
And so we don't just turn around and give it back as soon as they start acting good.

33:06.180 --> 33:07.620
It has to be consistent.

33:07.620 --> 33:14.820
It has to be consistent over a minimum of six months, and that's showing up consistent in

33:14.820 --> 33:16.820
every aspect of their life.

33:16.820 --> 33:20.820
This response doesn't appear any more honest than the others, as a matter of fact there are many

33:20.820 --> 33:25.220
details that don't seem to add up at all or line up to her previous narratives, even ones spoken

33:25.220 --> 33:29.540
about in previous videos. The Frankies conclude by stating that the story is his to tell if he

33:29.540 --> 33:34.180
chooses to, and with that they draw a line under the situation and all points of view surrounding

33:34.180 --> 33:37.300
it. They say that they are proud of how their kids have handled it, and there are passionate

33:37.300 --> 33:41.220
defences of their parents, including their daughter who posted on her Instagram in a message

33:41.220 --> 33:44.900
which doesn't sound remotely like anything her elders would say, and the son in a wonderful

33:44.900 --> 33:49.140
place right now, with a good group of friends and a healthy outlook on life where he holds high

33:49.140 --> 33:54.180
standards and high boundaries. It seems that this challenge had only made their bond as a family

33:54.180 --> 33:58.980
stronger, there was nothing that these malicious online trolls could say which could ever hold them

33:58.980 --> 34:00.500
back, was there?

34:04.180 --> 34:12.420
In the insider interview, the Frankies also provide their input on one more clip, the one where

34:12.420 --> 34:15.620
Ruby refuses to give her daughter lunch after she had forgotten it.

34:15.620 --> 34:21.220
Ruby- And hopefully, hopefully nobody gives her food and nobody steps in and gives her a lunch.

34:21.220 --> 34:25.860
Once again they state there is missing context, and in fact Ruby had a lot of sympathy, but ultimately

34:25.860 --> 34:30.980
they were so near the end of the day and that it was a one and a half hour round trip etc etc etc,

34:30.980 --> 34:35.860
and maybe there is the distant possibility that this is true, but it's just not how it came across.

34:35.860 --> 34:41.460
Ruby- She was responsible for making her lunches in the morning and she actually told me she did

34:41.460 --> 34:46.180
pack a lunch, so the natural outcome is she's just going to need to be hungry,

34:47.620 --> 34:53.540
and hopefully, hopefully nobody gives her food and nobody steps in and gives her a lunch.

34:53.540 --> 34:57.300
There almost certainly is missing context because it's a clip from a YouTube video,

34:57.380 --> 35:01.380
but this additional context provided by the parents doesn't really undermine the simple

35:01.380 --> 35:06.100
observation that you sat in the car and chose to say that you hope nobody gives her food to

35:06.100 --> 35:09.780
teach her a lesson. The Frankies' responses in the article appear to attempt to present their

35:09.780 --> 35:13.380
parental style in a different light than their own content does, and given that they're the

35:13.380 --> 35:17.140
ones who choose to upload those videos in the first place, it wasn't particularly convincing

35:17.140 --> 35:21.620
as backtracking goes. If any of the people who advocate over this style of parenting read these

35:21.620 --> 35:26.340
articles, they probably would have found it weak, and many of her critics were still not convinced.

35:26.340 --> 35:31.220
On one hand, by the end of June 2020, the outrage over their parental conduct had mostly passed,

35:31.220 --> 35:34.900
and a large majority of the Frankies' critics were not necessarily followers of the Eight

35:34.900 --> 35:39.060
Passengers YouTube channel, so their investment or lack of shouldn't have influenced the ability

35:39.060 --> 35:43.380
to upload successful content. Nevertheless, the family responses hadn't really instilled

35:43.380 --> 35:47.380
confidence in viewers either. For people who had casually viewed her content and not necessarily

35:47.380 --> 35:51.700
noticed these parental strategies until they were pointed out, Ruby and Kevin's responses weren't

35:51.700 --> 35:55.700
convincing. The simple fact was that whether a psychologist recommended that her two sons

35:55.700 --> 35:59.940
be separated doesn't negate the information they still actively chose to leave an available

35:59.940 --> 36:04.900
bedroom empty after moving house, something that I do wonder how psychologists would feel about.

36:04.900 --> 36:08.420
However, if you were a fan of the Eight Passengers YouTube channel and actually found their parental

36:08.420 --> 36:12.420
style to be appealing to you, you probably don't like their moving the goalposts either,

36:12.420 --> 36:16.100
because it seems to imply that they've actually been leaving information out of their videos

36:16.100 --> 36:19.700
to make their parental style look stricter than it is, which for a YouTube channel that

36:19.700 --> 36:23.940
occasionally presents themselves as an authority on parenting is a betrayal of sorts.

36:24.740 --> 36:30.820
Austin! What are you... What are you... What's going through your head?

36:34.420 --> 36:35.060
Oh my god!

36:41.700 --> 36:45.940
A lot of family channels on YouTube managed to maintain an audience despite being pretty awful

36:45.940 --> 36:50.820
because they don't necessarily set up the pretense that they possess any actual wisdom on parenting.

36:50.820 --> 36:54.580
As I said at the start, people watch them for entertainment, and therefore when they publish

36:54.580 --> 36:59.060
controversial or provocative content, their core viewership isn't necessarily switched off by it,

36:59.060 --> 37:03.620
even if others do call them out. With the Eight Passengers channel, Ruby always attempted to find

37:03.620 --> 37:07.540
some form of moral foundation to underpin the content with, to turn around and say,

37:07.540 --> 37:11.780
well that isn't the entire story, even if it's in the form of defending yourself is going to

37:11.780 --> 37:15.940
disillusion at least some of those who had formerly found value in what you created. The truth was

37:15.940 --> 37:20.260
that although the anger from external sources had mostly passed, there was a degree of distrust that

37:20.260 --> 37:24.740
lingered amongst viewership. When the situation initially broke, Eight Passengers lost a fair few

37:24.740 --> 37:28.820
subscribers, and if they successfully vindicated themselves amongst those viewers, they would have

37:28.820 --> 37:33.060
returned. A check of Social Blade would tell you that that did not happen, as a matter of fact,

37:33.060 --> 37:37.940
quite the opposite. I can't believe this is how freeze-dried gummy bears look. I feel like I did

37:37.940 --> 37:44.260
something wrong. Look at this, those are really good. Those are really good. Eight Passengers

37:44.260 --> 37:48.980
continued to upload over the remainder of 2020, and for the extent of 2021 as well. Not too much

37:48.980 --> 37:53.140
was said about them online, and going over their content in this time, it was noticeably milder,

37:53.140 --> 37:57.620
with nearly a complete avoidance of confrontation altogether. It was very apparent that their brush

37:57.620 --> 38:01.300
with their critics had steered them completely clear of addressing disciplinary issues in their

38:01.300 --> 38:06.180
family, and they wanted to rebuild their image, although they were integrating some more curious

38:06.180 --> 38:11.700
language. I don't know how to write a book, and then when I wrote the book, I learned new things,

38:11.700 --> 38:15.540
and I went back and I saw all of the distortion that was in my first book, and I thought,

38:15.620 --> 38:19.220
this can't be right. Interesting way to use the word distortion, but

38:19.220 --> 38:24.100
I digress. Obviously, people still felt the way they did, but even amongst declining viewership,

38:24.100 --> 38:28.020
the words of what they said at the end of the Insider article still rang true. What mattered

38:28.020 --> 38:32.260
is that they were a healthy, happy family first, and although they had been shaken by the drama,

38:32.260 --> 38:36.420
they must have seen the bright side of it, right? Well, there was one more article published in the

38:36.420 --> 38:39.940
aftermath of their run-in with the internet. Published by The Ramp, this think piece once

38:39.940 --> 38:43.700
more reflects where the Ruby and Kevin's own punishment was justified for how they were

38:43.700 --> 38:47.860
portrayed. I don't really care too much for what The Ramp says in this article, but it certainly

38:47.860 --> 38:52.100
provides an interesting insight into where the Frankie's were now. Over a year on, still

38:52.100 --> 38:56.020
ruined the legacy of a situation that lasted a couple weeks, talking about the mob and the

38:56.020 --> 39:00.260
sponsors they lost due to it. There's a real element of despondency in the tone of the Frankie's

39:00.260 --> 39:04.020
throughout the article, they have not moved on. Despite being a channel with approximately 1

39:04.020 --> 39:08.500
billion views from content, an extensive catalogue that many people frequently return to, despite

39:08.500 --> 39:13.380
surviving the slew of criticism and still scoring at least 100,000 views a day on most days,

39:13.380 --> 39:17.940
it was not enough. As a family channel, what you're providing is, in essence, a slice of life

39:17.940 --> 39:22.020
content, you're documenting things that in many households would occur naturally. This doesn't

39:22.020 --> 39:26.180
mean that YouTube is any less of a job for those people, but there's a purported sincerity that

39:26.180 --> 39:30.820
this is what you love, and you would still do it the same way even if the cameras were off.

39:30.820 --> 39:34.980
Ruby's husband, Kevin, still had a well-paying job as far as we knew, the YouTube channel was

39:34.980 --> 39:38.900
a wonderful bonus, and in videos, Ruby didn't present it any other way.

39:39.060 --> 39:45.220
Cooking in the kitchen when my kids were little was not very fun. I hated it because it was always

39:45.220 --> 39:49.700
messier and it took longer than it really needed to, but what we really like to do now is cook

39:49.700 --> 39:56.500
together, we're constantly making food together. I think we pretty much live in this room constantly.

39:56.500 --> 39:59.940
I'm going to be blunt here, but there was something about how they speak in this interview

39:59.940 --> 40:03.940
which provides the impression that they care more about the content than they do their own family.

40:03.940 --> 40:07.540
The fact of the matter is that both sides had the chance to present their perspectives,

40:07.540 --> 40:11.460
and as Ruby and Kevin noted themselves, most of these critics were not frequent viewers of

40:11.460 --> 40:15.220
the channel. Unfortunately, their response wasn't convincing enough for some who were,

40:15.220 --> 40:19.140
and they couldn't recoup that, and in spite of the fact that they still actually retained a lot,

40:19.140 --> 40:23.460
they felt more comfortable lamenting what they could've had, rather than what was in front of

40:23.460 --> 40:34.660
them. They still had their family, right? Well. There's often justified reason to question the

40:34.660 --> 40:38.580
authenticity of YouTube couples. When you build a life around that, there's a pressure that you

40:38.580 --> 40:42.420
must stay together for your image, for their perception of you. When that becomes intertwined

40:42.420 --> 40:45.940
with your business, it can cause a lot of complications. I'd say the same could be said

40:45.940 --> 40:50.100
about family channels. By this point, it was apparent that people weren't receiving the full

40:50.100 --> 40:54.180
picture of what was truly going on inside the Frankie household. Although they had since mostly

40:54.180 --> 40:58.340
avoided discussing discipline on their channel, they still defended their actions when asked,

40:58.340 --> 41:02.820
which to many would imply that this reality they were creating for the camera was more manufactured

41:02.820 --> 41:06.740
than ever. Their statements to the rap reinforced this, if you're not happy with the channel where

41:06.740 --> 41:11.380
you post your life, the memories of you and your family, then how can you truly be happy with that

41:11.380 --> 41:16.340
life either? And at the start of 2022, the 8 Passengers YouTube channel posted its last video

41:16.340 --> 41:20.820
before falling inactive. Maybe they'd finally realised how detrimental this environment was

41:20.820 --> 41:25.140
to those they loved, and took steps to remove themselves from that so they could heal properly,

41:25.140 --> 41:29.540
or maybe they were just investing their energy into something else. So with that in mind,

41:29.540 --> 41:32.820
let's introduce a supporting character to this lovely tale.

41:32.820 --> 41:39.620
If you're like me, you've had pain in your life. It could be from a divorce, work conflicts,

41:39.620 --> 41:46.820
relationship issues with children, grandchildren, spouse anxiety, depression, or fear that you don't

41:46.820 --> 41:52.820
understand, feelings that you're not enough, or that you're unlovable. Connections is the solution.

41:52.820 --> 41:57.940
This is Jodie Hildebrandt. She is a founder of self-help company Connections. With over two decades

41:57.940 --> 42:01.700
experience in the psychotherapy world, at a passing glance she may not strike you as anyone

42:01.700 --> 42:06.340
out of the ordinary. However, her background does deviate a little from that of the usual therapist.

42:06.340 --> 42:10.740
She completed a graduate work in educational psychology, and registered as a licensed counselor

42:10.740 --> 42:14.900
in Utah with Cirque Lodge, a rehabilitation clinic for people struggling with addiction.

42:14.900 --> 42:18.660
However, she left the profession not too long after joining, expressing dissolution of the

42:18.660 --> 42:23.620
welfare of her patients. In her own words, they were not healing. So she decided to set up her

42:23.620 --> 42:28.580
own organization, with a goal to empower people, helping patients harness the truth, and avoiding

42:28.580 --> 42:33.060
the treacherous distortions that manifest themselves in our lives. This assistance takes

42:33.060 --> 42:37.860
the form of paid courses that you can access online or in person. Although in many ways it

42:37.860 --> 42:41.540
doesn't appear the most threatening, there is certainly a language choice that would strike

42:41.540 --> 42:46.820
readers as somewhat cultish, and further reading wouldn't inspire too much hope either. Hildebrandt

42:46.820 --> 42:51.700
herself had been subject to a period of probation in 2012 after breaching patient confidentiality

42:51.700 --> 42:56.820
multiple times by revealing information about her patients to other counselors, church clergy,

42:56.820 --> 43:01.780
and even a local university, all of which without their consent. Although she successfully regained

43:01.780 --> 43:06.340
her license and resumed her practice, when you pair it with her present-day ventures, you wouldn't be

43:06.340 --> 43:11.300
wrong to exercise some caution. Nevertheless, that didn't stop people from signing up.

43:11.300 --> 43:17.220
A couple of those people being Kevin and Ruby Frankie. Kevin- And some of these parenting-isms, these

43:17.220 --> 43:24.180
cultural-isms that have contaminated parenting are things like beliefs that, it's my job to make

43:24.180 --> 43:29.060
my kids happy. Hildebrandt- Give them a magical childhood. Kevin- It's my job to give my child

43:29.060 --> 43:36.900
a magical childhood. It's my job to make my children smile and laugh. It's my job to make

43:36.900 --> 43:45.140
my children successful. It's my job to prevent my children from having pain, right? All of these,

43:45.140 --> 43:50.260
they all come from the same place, and it all comes from this belief, this distorted belief,

43:50.900 --> 43:58.340
that I can measure my worth as an individual by how I parent. The Frankie family's first public

43:58.340 --> 44:02.260
association with connections came via announcement on their Instagram page, where they were proclaimed

44:02.260 --> 44:05.860
as panel members at an upcoming couples conference. However, one can assume that they were

44:05.860 --> 44:09.220
likely involved in the business before then, especially given that they had previously

44:09.220 --> 44:13.140
traveled to Europe with Paige Hanna, another creator who was previously affiliated with the

44:13.140 --> 44:17.460
business. They appeared to have started counseling towards the end of 2020 due to videos posted on

44:17.460 --> 44:21.460
connections' Facebook accounts. In spite of this, it seems that the controversy is what pushed them

44:21.460 --> 44:25.380
to be more vocally involved, possibly seeking reinforcement for their own beliefs, and in the

44:25.380 --> 44:29.460
coming couple years they were featured more and more promptly on the website and accompanying

44:29.460 --> 44:33.540
social media, with a favor even being returned on the 8 Passengers YouTube channel. Hildebrandt- One

44:33.540 --> 44:38.740
resource that I really like for mental health is connectionsclassroom.com. I will have the

44:38.740 --> 44:43.060
connections classroom website down in the description box below, and you can also follow

44:43.060 --> 44:47.940
them on Instagram over at connections coaching. Ruby in particular seemed to be devoting significant

44:47.940 --> 44:52.180
portions of her personal time to associating with connections, and with the YouTube channel firmly

44:52.180 --> 44:56.740
in the rearview mirror, she began to take this venture rather seriously, if not a little too

44:56.740 --> 45:01.540
seriously. The first casualty of her new commitment was the 8 Passengers Instagram account. In the past,

45:01.540 --> 45:05.700
this had been a supplement to the YouTube channel, where she had shared many of her fondest memories,

45:05.700 --> 45:10.820
but on the 28th of June a new post was uploaded, a series of images overloaded with circles,

45:10.820 --> 45:15.380
underlining, and various words capitalized, alongside a text post rambling about what the

45:15.380 --> 45:20.180
principles are. Next to a litany of hashtags at the bottom were the messages of honesty,

45:20.180 --> 45:25.140
responsibility, and humility, words we'd seen before, but this time it was Ruby Frankie who

45:25.140 --> 45:30.020
was promulgating them. Around this time the 8 Passengers Instagram account rebranded to

45:30.020 --> 45:34.820
Moms of Truth, with it becoming an account dedicated to Jodie and Ruby's thoughts

45:34.820 --> 45:38.420
and teachings. It was almost somewhat scary how disposable all the previous

45:38.420 --> 45:41.940
family content was to her, but she had clearly found a new calling.

45:41.940 --> 45:51.220
Truth is love. Truth creates. Truth gives inspiration. Distortion deceives. Distortion

45:51.220 --> 46:00.340
destroys. Distortion attacks. Distortion looks for proof. Distortion points the finger. Distortion

46:00.340 --> 46:04.820
blames. In the following months, the post did not let up, with Ruby using this platform to promote

46:04.820 --> 46:08.980
various pieces of doctrine. Although it received positive feedback from supporters, many followers

46:08.980 --> 46:13.140
of the previous 8 Passengers Instagram account seemed confused, and even concerned about the

46:13.140 --> 46:17.380
language she was using in these video posts, utilizing anecdotes and analogies to speak

46:17.380 --> 46:22.900
very cryptically about parenting. Truth is not aggressive. Truth stands alone. Truth doesn't

46:22.900 --> 46:29.140
need to be proved. Truth just is. It's like the sun, the sun doesn't have to get allies to come

46:29.140 --> 46:35.220
around it and give it validation that it exists. It just exists. It doesn't need anybody to point

46:35.220 --> 46:39.700
it out. It's just there. It seems, though, that this wasn't just having a negative effect on her

46:39.700 --> 46:44.500
public presence. Towards the end of Summer 2022, rumours began to circulate that Ruby was no longer

46:44.500 --> 46:48.580
living with her husband Kevin, and that although there was no official divorce, there wasn't any

46:48.580 --> 46:52.660
apparent intent to re-establish contact. Word was that further this, it was reported that their

46:52.660 --> 46:57.140
oldest son had also moved out of the family house, possibly staying with their father. It also began

46:57.140 --> 47:00.660
to spread that Ruby's oldest daughter was no longer in contact with the family either, and

47:00.660 --> 47:04.580
towards the end of September, she took to Instagram to respond to these rumours, stating that although

47:04.580 --> 47:08.180
it was true that she was no longer in contact with those formerly close to her, and that she had

47:08.180 --> 47:11.940
denounced the teachings and connections, many of the rumours were also unhelpful, and that she

47:11.940 --> 47:16.100
would appreciate some privacy on the matter going forward. With the 8 Passengers YouTube channel

47:16.100 --> 47:19.700
being brought to an end, you wouldn't be amiss to think that it could have provided an opportunity

47:19.700 --> 47:24.100
to finally cut away from the superficiality that such a platform constrains YouTube, and back to

47:24.180 --> 47:29.140
being that devoted parent. The cessation of uploads meant that Ruby no longer had a commitment to the

47:29.140 --> 47:33.780
image she portrayed on said YouTube channel. However, it seems that image was actually more

47:33.780 --> 47:38.100
charitable than reality, and now that she was unshackled, she was falling into a dangerous

47:38.100 --> 47:42.820
spiral towards a fanatical belief system that sought to justify her parenting. If Ruby's

47:42.820 --> 47:46.580
social media has told us anything, it was never about her family.

47:46.580 --> 47:53.300
Intro

47:53.300 --> 47:56.660
The problem when you're being pulled into an organisation like the one Jodie Hildebrandt

47:56.660 --> 48:00.980
was operating is that you often don't realise that it's happening. Even if Ruby Franky was

48:00.980 --> 48:04.660
never someone you wanted to run into, prior to the renovation of her Instagram account,

48:04.660 --> 48:08.580
she still possessed some characteristics that could be identified with her. In these videos,

48:08.580 --> 48:12.740
though, her only real personality was spreading the message of connections and applying it to

48:12.740 --> 48:16.660
her own life. It should have been clear that this was a person deeply unwell. Nevertheless,

48:16.660 --> 48:20.900
although many had now vocally expressed their concern, even likely many of those close to Ruby,

48:20.900 --> 48:25.220
one of the scariest factors of cult mentality is that explicative dissonance, that you can just

48:25.220 --> 48:29.220
dismiss someone by stating they're too ignorant to understand, and I have no doubt that's why

48:29.220 --> 48:33.940
the Franky mother continued down this path without any outward trepidation or apprehension.

48:33.940 --> 48:37.380
Her language was filled with a plethora of buzzwords that wouldn't really make sense in

48:37.380 --> 48:41.300
regular conversation, but obviously held meaning within connections, and although most of the

48:41.300 --> 48:45.860
online crowd rejected these doctrines, one person continued to reward Ruby's loyalty.

48:45.860 --> 48:51.220
Jodie, who towards the end of 2022 invited Ruby onto her connections podcast and YouTube channel,

48:51.220 --> 48:55.380
and appointed her to the business team and acclaimed her as a certified mental fitness

48:55.380 --> 49:00.420
trainer. Certified by who? Well, we don't know, but I'm sure it only further emboldened Ruby's

49:00.420 --> 49:04.980
image of herself as a missionary for this message in her mind. Perhaps this made little sense given

49:04.980 --> 49:09.060
Ruby's staunchly religious upbringing, but although there were mentions of God and Christianity

49:09.060 --> 49:13.620
in Connections writings, it mostly seems like a pseudo-scientific approach to supporting certain

49:13.620 --> 49:17.940
conservative religious values. It seems that everyone who was in proximity of Ruby was

49:17.940 --> 49:21.700
escaping as quickly as they could, but what about the people who couldn't?

49:21.700 --> 49:27.860
If your kid came to you on fire, would you say, I'm so glad you trusted me to tell me you're on

49:27.860 --> 49:32.020
fire, that if I put out the fire that's gonna really hurt and you're gonna end up with scabs

49:32.020 --> 49:37.860
anyway, so I'm just gonna love you where you are right now? No! You throw them on the ground and

49:37.860 --> 49:42.980
you start rolling them, you get a blanket and you start hitting the flames, and they're gonna say,

49:42.980 --> 49:48.260
you're hurting me, you're beating me, you're controlling us, like, no dear, hold still,

49:48.260 --> 49:53.700
I'm getting the fire out. That's what a loving parent does, because nobody will do it, it looks

49:53.700 --> 49:58.260
to the world crazy. Her Moms of Truth account, although being a rather transparent advocacy

49:58.260 --> 50:02.660
platform for the Connections way of life, also revolved around topics of parenting, hence the

50:02.660 --> 50:07.460
Moms part of the account name. By now, people already had an idea of her parental methods,

50:07.460 --> 50:11.620
but with more of these videos in the posts, it began to dawn on people that Ruby's opinions

50:11.620 --> 50:17.220
were becoming even more extreme and aberrant. Ruby- What in the world? Yes, yes, sleepovers

50:17.220 --> 50:21.300
are distorted. She wouldn't let her children sleep over at a friend's house, she doesn't like laid

50:21.300 --> 50:26.020
back children or angry people, she and Jodie just get really annoyed at a meme for some reason,

50:26.020 --> 50:31.220
and you also shouldn't be doing your nails out of insecurity, I guess. Ruby- I'm going to go out and

50:31.220 --> 50:36.820
do my nails per se, there's nothing inherently inappropriate or distorted about doing your nails,

50:36.820 --> 50:46.580
however, if I go and do my nails because I'm feeling ugly or I'm wanting to have some social

50:46.580 --> 50:51.780
activity with somebody and I don't have any of my friends around and so I want to go engage with

50:51.780 --> 50:56.820
the people at the nail salon because I want to distract myself because my life is not comfortable,

50:57.460 --> 51:03.540
then those would be motives that would not be responsible. Ultimately though, I think what is

51:03.540 --> 51:07.300
most concerning is the sort of morals that underscore this content, particularly from a

51:07.300 --> 51:11.940
parenting perspective. Really, living in truth is just connections jargon for having an extreme

51:11.940 --> 51:16.180
level of control in one's life. Everything you do is a choice, from every action to the expression

51:16.180 --> 51:20.740
of every emotion, and you're more than what you feel, etc. It's not an inherently dangerous point

51:20.740 --> 51:24.500
of view when presented under that image, and it's never a bad idea to try and encourage people

51:24.500 --> 51:28.100
towards a state where they can channel their feelings more productively. At the same time,

51:28.100 --> 51:32.340
this is a dangerous manifestation of it, and it promotes the ideal person through a very

51:32.340 --> 51:37.140
homogenous lens, which is why Ruby and Jodie waste no time getting to micromanaging the motives

51:37.140 --> 51:41.780
behind doing your nails. Those sorts of behaviours must be stamped out, and that's a particularly

51:41.780 --> 51:45.060
detrimental point of view for one demographic, children.

51:45.060 --> 51:50.900
Ruby- You, the mom, are not responsible to make school fun and entertaining.

51:50.900 --> 51:54.180
Jodie- Whaaaat? Ruby- Yeah, you're not.

51:54.180 --> 51:59.860
Guess what, if your child finds homeschool boring, that's because he chose to be bored.

51:59.860 --> 52:06.820
That's because she chose to have a perception of needing to be entertained. It's a form of entitlement.

52:06.820 --> 52:10.100
I don't need to explain the psychology behind why younger people may struggle

52:10.100 --> 52:13.300
over controlling their emotions and their actions more than older people.

52:13.300 --> 52:17.380
Misbehaviour is an inevitability, and what matters is that the lesson is learned.

52:17.380 --> 52:21.460
The philosophy of connections, though, wants a mould, and a person to fit very tightly inside

52:21.460 --> 52:25.380
that mould. Ruby Frankly was always a person who leaned towards more punitive parenting to

52:25.380 --> 52:30.660
teach her children those messages, she saw as her duty to enact the consequences of those actions.

52:30.660 --> 52:35.700
Yet with an ever narrowing view on what was even represented by good behaviour, her parenting style

52:35.700 --> 52:40.100
was appearing more and more unhinged, with her continuing to promote these methods in her podcasts

52:40.100 --> 52:44.740
and live videos, stating that she cared more about the pursuit of principles than her own children.

52:44.740 --> 52:48.740
It would lead some to be quite concerned about the safety of a family in the care of this person

52:48.740 --> 52:54.020
who seems to think that she has free reign to act as she wishes. After all, she is in truth,

52:54.020 --> 52:56.980
and you are in distortion, something that she seemed to embrace when

52:56.980 --> 53:01.140
emotionally reflecting on her decision to discontinue the 8 Passengers YouTube series.

53:01.140 --> 53:07.300
You wonder why I left YouTube? It's to save my kids. No amount of money.

53:08.260 --> 53:16.660
And I'm telling you, I was making millions, and I left it, because my kids were being

53:16.660 --> 53:24.260
hurt with entitlement, they were being hurt with people's advice, and they didn't have a mother up

53:24.260 --> 53:29.060
the front saying, I don't care what the world's opinion is, this is the truth, and this is where

53:29.060 --> 53:33.700
I stand. And fortunately, I had a chance, I had them in my home long enough to do it,

53:33.700 --> 53:38.340
and I'm not going to lose them. Normally, this would be a very good decision. I think most of

53:38.340 --> 53:42.180
her critics agree that she should not have been sharing aspects of her family's life on the

53:42.180 --> 53:46.260
YouTube channel, and it wouldn't be healthy for a marriage. But without any record on how she was

53:46.580 --> 53:51.060
treating the children now, people are actually growing more concerned, especially how she spoke

53:51.060 --> 53:55.300
about parenting in these clips. She seemed to not just be promoting traditional values,

53:55.300 --> 54:00.180
but obsessive, overbearing, and restrictive ideas with the expectation that her children

54:00.180 --> 54:04.660
will just turn around and say thank you. They're trying to hold you hostage, saying you need to

54:04.660 --> 54:09.540
give me privacy, you need to honor my boundaries, you need to honor my feelings, you don't care

54:09.540 --> 54:18.500
about me, you're invading my space, those are my personal feelings. No. In this home, you don't get

54:18.500 --> 54:24.260
personal space, because this is my space, because I'm the parent. If you want your own personal

54:24.260 --> 54:30.260
space, you'll need to get your own space. This is mine. And as long as you're living in my home,

54:30.260 --> 54:38.340
it is my job to know everything about you. In 2023, these concerns were not eased,

54:38.340 --> 54:43.220
and more TikTok accounts and media outlets began to pick up on her downward spiral, even referring

54:43.220 --> 54:47.940
to older clips which had come under scrutiny in the past, but Ruby persisted. She was also still

54:47.940 --> 54:52.340
distant from her husband, with many wondering if divorce would be the final outcome, but Ruby

54:52.340 --> 54:56.260
persisted. Her relationships with her family weren't appearing to improve either, and one of the

54:56.260 --> 55:01.060
strongest slights of all, her oldest daughter celebrated her 20th birthday at her sister Bonnie's,

55:01.060 --> 55:06.260
with them celebrating in a video that was uploaded to their YouTube channel, but Ruby persisted.

55:06.260 --> 55:11.620
So, Jodi and I have each shared an example from our own lives of what real love looks like,

55:11.620 --> 55:16.820
which isn't what the world thinks is love. They'd push back and say, whoa, that's mean,

55:16.820 --> 55:22.820
you're not going to be loved, your children are going to kick you out of their lives. Anytime

55:22.820 --> 55:27.940
that you make a decision, and in the back of your mind you have, well, I want them to take care of

55:27.940 --> 55:33.620
me in my old age, that's not love. That's not love. There was no circumstance under which her style

55:33.620 --> 55:36.980
of parenting could possibly be wrong, and although she may have been a neglectful,

55:36.980 --> 55:41.860
selfish parent in the past, this time she was going to get it right, by being a part of every

55:41.860 --> 55:46.660
one of her remaining children's lives. She had to show them the way of truth, and lead them out

55:46.660 --> 55:53.140
of distortion, towards those principles of honesty, responsibility, and humility.

55:53.140 --> 55:58.020
Police say this is the house a young child escaped from, and went to a neighbor's house,

55:58.020 --> 56:00.020
asking for food and water.

56:00.580 --> 56:01.080
Yeah.

56:03.620 --> 56:12.260
Music

56:12.260 --> 56:17.060
On August the 30th of 2023, the police were called to the household of a concerned civilian

56:17.060 --> 56:21.700
in Ivins, Utah, to follow up on reports of a juvenile in need of help. This individual was

56:21.700 --> 56:25.780
described as malnourished with duct tape on the extremities, a condition so severe that the

56:25.780 --> 56:30.100
authorities decided they would require hospital treatment. The evidence led officers to a nearby

56:30.100 --> 56:33.540
home where they found another youngster in a similar condition, and transported them to a

56:33.540 --> 56:36.980
hospital as well, with the remaining children in place under the care of the Department of

56:36.980 --> 56:40.820
Child and Family Services. Following further investigation into this incident, two arrests

56:40.820 --> 56:44.180
were made, Jody Hildebrandt, and Ruby Franke.

56:44.180 --> 56:55.780
Music

56:55.780 --> 56:59.460
It seems that many people's concerns were more than justified, and that it may not have just

56:59.460 --> 57:03.940
been as bad as some may have imagined, but worse. Over the coming days, more details would be

57:03.940 --> 57:08.340
revealed as neighbors and family members expressed relief that action had finally been taken. Ruby's

57:08.340 --> 57:12.180
oldest daughter was one of the first to post a statement to her Instagram, stating that herself

57:12.180 --> 57:16.340
and her family had been trying to tell the police and CPS for years about this, and they were glad

57:16.340 --> 57:20.660
that they had finally stepped in. Franke's sisters also posted a joint Instagram statement expressing

57:20.660 --> 57:24.900
the necessity for Franke and Hildebrandt's detention. Ruby's oldest also requested help on

57:24.900 --> 57:29.140
finding any incriminating clips that could help the legal case against the two detainees. This

57:29.220 --> 57:33.060
would be elaborated on in future videos by Bonnie and Julie, both of which state that they had an

57:33.060 --> 57:37.300
otherwise pretty strong family relationship until Jody and connections became involved,

57:37.300 --> 57:41.700
and would eventually cause the rift between them and Ruby to open up. As sisters, they're obviously

57:41.700 --> 57:45.540
going to be more sympathetic to a family member they've known for years, but they still don't

57:45.540 --> 57:47.620
defend or justify her actions.

57:47.620 --> 57:52.260
Jody Hildebrandt-"We all felt weird about this Jody lady, we weren't comfortable with it,

57:52.260 --> 57:56.100
we didn't like it, we didn't like the teachings Ruby was bringing to the family functions,

57:56.100 --> 58:00.500
and we were this close to telling her if you come to our family events anymore,

58:00.500 --> 58:04.500
we do not want to hear what you were learning through connections because we don't like it.

58:04.500 --> 58:12.420
My thoughts towards Ruby and Jody and Kevin and connections is that it was all bullcrap.

58:13.300 --> 58:20.180
It was complete indoctrination of this thing that they created."

58:20.180 --> 58:24.020
It was also revealed that even Ruby's neighbors had contacted the police on multiple occasions

58:24.020 --> 58:28.260
regarding her behavior, which included taping paper over her window, leaving her children

58:28.260 --> 58:32.340
alone in the house for weeks on end, and having them pulling weeds outside in the garden in 100

58:32.340 --> 58:36.020
degree Fahrenheit heats, stating that although the police would make an appearance, they could

58:36.020 --> 58:40.500
never find any actual evidence of illicit activity. On Friday the 1st of September,

58:40.500 --> 58:44.180
with evidence of videos filmed at Hildebrandt's house a couple days before placing them at the

58:44.180 --> 58:47.780
scene of the crime, and evidence consistent with the wounds inflicted on the victims,

58:47.780 --> 58:51.540
they were both charged with six counts of aggravated child abuse and denied bail due

58:51.540 --> 58:54.980
to the severity of the injuries sustained, which were revealed to be allegedly from

58:54.980 --> 58:59.620
being restrained while honey and cayenne pepper were rubbed into wounds. Over the following weeks,

58:59.620 --> 59:03.460
old plates would re-emerge once more with the context of what we were now aware of,

59:03.460 --> 59:07.380
leaving many to argue that this could have been prevented if authorities had acted faster.

59:07.380 --> 59:11.380
And they're gonna say, you're hurting me, you're beating me, you're controlling us, like,

59:11.380 --> 59:14.660
no dear, hold still, I'm getting the fire out.

59:14.660 --> 59:18.900
Frankie appeared in court via video link on the 5th of September to defend her actions,

59:18.980 --> 59:22.580
and with the presence of her estranged husband, state attorneys, and other parents,

59:22.580 --> 59:27.220
proceeded to make detailed accusations of serious sexual misconduct against her own child.

59:27.220 --> 59:31.140
She provided no evidence for this, but did not hold back, and even referred to the offspring

59:31.140 --> 59:36.020
of people in the room. I suppose the implication is that she is using these allegations to justify

59:36.020 --> 59:40.020
her own reactions. It didn't appear to work though, although the judge requested the child

59:40.020 --> 59:43.780
be placed in a home with no other peers as a precautionary measure. A few days later,

59:43.780 --> 59:47.860
adding to the ever increasing list of people speaking out, Kevin's sisters gave statements

59:47.860 --> 59:52.180
against Ruby's claims, and also revealed more information regarding her and Kevin's separation,

59:52.180 --> 59:56.980
stating that Jody had moved in with the Frankie's in 2022, which is when she tightened her strangle

59:56.980 --> 01:00:01.700
hold on the family, not even allowing Kevin to speak to Ruby unless she was present. Eventually

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:05.780
she encouraged Ruby to separate from Kevin, and he was moved to a townhouse where a minder from

01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:10.180
connections would watch over him. The in-laws viewed Kevin as being brainwashed, and although

01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:14.420
they believe he's a good person, they admit there are more questions than answers relating to how

01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:18.900
he behaved throughout the situation. Like Ruby, at this point he had not made any comments to the

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:23.060
media, so people were unsure of his position. In a brief statement on the 18th of September,

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:27.140
his lawyer stated that he did not wish to point fingers and wanted to focus on rebuilding

01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:31.060
relationships, though this did not address his involvement in the actual allegations.

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:34.900
This would change on the 5th of October however, when People Magazine would publish an article

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:38.900
titled Inside the Ruby Frankie Case, which provided a perspective from the estranged

01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:42.820
husband with his lawyer once again doing a majority of the talking. Relating to the claims

01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:47.380
at hand, Randy Kester, speaking on behalf of Kevin, stated that Ruby's former life companion

01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:51.220
was shocked at hearing the details of the arrest, claiming that he had been awfully deceived into

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:55.460
the status of the children, and that he had only spoken to Ruby sporadically over the past year,

01:00:55.460 --> 01:01:00.180
with her separating from him after claiming that his attitude was infesting their family,

01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:04.420
whatever that means, and that the oldest son had also moved out with Kevin, but Jody had stepped

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:08.740
in on that matter as well. His lawyer states that he was isolated from his whole family, and was

01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:13.300
only reached out three or four times over the next year, thus was not kept in the loop regarding

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:17.380
the rest of the family's status. This seemed to separate him from the recent events as a whole,

01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:21.140
in spite of the observable problems on the YouTube channel and elsewhere on social media.

01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:24.980
It was clear that Kevin was being highly cautious about making statements to the press,

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:29.300
and why he had mostly refrained from doing so, he wanted custody of the remaining children,

01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:33.380
and this was clear from the September statement. In comment sections, many were still suspicious

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:37.140
as to his involvement with the whole situation though, with Bonnie being quite vocal about his

01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:41.060
inaction while it transpired, and further news being released that he had attempted to have

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:44.820
his daughter charged with theft following a house visit in which he took some items.

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:52.740
Bonnie- The one person that could have done something within his legal right was Kevin.

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:59.380
We had zero contact with him. It was Kevin's job to check in on things, and he did not.

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:04.500
With everything leading up to the arrest of Ruby Frankie and Jody Hildebrandt in mind,

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:08.740
their detention could have signalled an end to this terrifying saga, but it turned out to be

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:12.900
just the beginning of increasingly bizarre and contentious claims from all sides that only

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:17.060
provoked more concern, and let the living situation of vulnerable parties in limbo.

01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:20.660
How much did certain parties know, and how much could they be trusted?

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:24.740
The shadow of one woman still loomed over the case.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:39.540
On the 17th October 2023, the judge presiding over the case ordered it closed to the public

01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:43.300
and the media from there on. This is probably for the best given the beast they were dealing with,

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:47.700
and the fact that anything said would immediately be reported on and speculated about. Ruby Frankie

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:51.860
still has immense power as a former content creator, and even if what she said was held

01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:55.860
in contempt, it was still disseminated and discussed, which likely wasn't the best for

01:02:55.860 --> 01:03:00.180
any parties concerned. However, in spite of the subsequent silence we may see from this case,

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:04.100
this uncertainty will not necessarily provide security or reassurance.

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:08.500
On the 18th December, Ruby enters a plea deal shifting blame onto her business partner,

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:11.620
of which I'll give an overview soon, but with censoring set for February,

01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:15.060
although prison time is a possibility, nothing is guaranteed.

01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:55.220
It's difficult to say what the exact outcome will be of the following months. To all internet

01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:59.460
dwellers, the evidence presents an open and shut case, but the real world never operates by the

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:02.900
rules of the world wide web, and it's not impossible that Ruby walks out of the courts

01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:06.660
as a free citizen. However, this also does not mean that civil courts will agree with this

01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:11.460
verdict, and going off the evidence available, they probably will not deem her fit to be a parent.

01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:15.540
In spite of it all, there is a distinct possibility that she will come out fighting,

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:20.020
and that this isn't the end of the saga. She made it very clear in her court appearances the length

01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:24.260
she is willing to go to defend her actions, and who knows what she may say about other parties

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:28.900
when given the opportunity to. While she still possessed a voice, she was going to use it.

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:33.540
Custody is a very sensitive matter that you cannot rush analysis of. To deem someone mentally

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:37.460
capable of overseeing the lives of multiple youths, particularly when they may have already

01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:41.620
suffered, is something that one cannot really afford to mishandle. Yet looking at the immediate

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:46.100
family and potential guardians, you'd be a bit pressed to really trust anyone. When you fall

01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:50.340
down such a rabbit hole, you're prone to often pushing the more reasonable people in your life

01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:55.060
away, and the only people remaining are people who may be treated with suspicion. From what we know,

01:04:55.060 --> 01:05:00.020
Ruby cut off nearly everyone in her life, or vice versa, with only a couple exceptions,

01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:04.660
Jodie and Kevin. I think we can rule out Jodie as a potential custody bearer, but what about

01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:09.540
her estranged ex-husband? He had clearly set out intent to rebuild the bridges that had been burned

01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:13.460
in the past year of their separation. Additionally, he had recently filed for divorce,

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:17.220
officially severing the ties between himself and his estranged wife. This seemed to be the

01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:21.380
signs of someone determined to make his own statement, but how much could he be trusted?

01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:27.060
Well, I'll just say it, I wanted to have sex a lot.

01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:32.180
With cult mentality, it's very difficult to tell where the network begins and ends. In this case,

01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:36.900
the prime individual to obtain custody over the children, Kevin, is a very untrustworthy figure.

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:41.220
Outside of recent events where he reportedly acted with hostility towards the eldest daughter,

01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:45.780
accounts from even his direct family tie him very close to the connections network. We know that

01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:52.100
they were involved from at latest 2019, before any of this transpired, and this persisted to 2022

01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:57.300
or even 2023. Though they were very sympathetic to his predicament, as revealed in the article,

01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:01.380
even his sisters were concerned that he was still suffering from the symptoms of brainwashing.

01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:05.380
Regardless of whether he is a victim of cult indoctrination in this case, it doesn't make

01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:09.380
him more mentally fit to be a parent right now. If anything, he should be focused on actually

01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:13.140
sorting himself out before expecting a responsibility that he had demonstrably

01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:17.620
failed to live up to in the past. Although he did not initiate the separation as far as we know,

01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:22.500
we know he did agree to it, did not challenge it, and accepted little to no contact with his

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:27.380
children, even when Rui was visibly mentally deteriorating on social media. There are some

01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:31.460
very cynical voices in this that could even say that he anticipated this happening and

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:35.300
agreed to the separation to give himself the best footing for a future custody case.

01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:40.660
I know that's a very tenuous speculation, but there is a serious lack of trust right now.

01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:47.860
So imagine going out and weeding your garden, but by weeding the garden, I mean you have this

01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:53.700
belief that weeding the garden is plucking the leaves off of all the weeds, but you leave the

01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:59.380
stems and the roots in place, but you just gotta weed, I gotta go pluck the little leaves off.

01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:04.420
That's parenting today. Video archives still build a case that is skeptical of his intent.

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:09.300
It appeared in videos with his wife justifying their actions, actions they took while working

01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:14.020
with connections that was a pipeline to Ruby's downward spiral. Just because he didn't go to

01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:18.580
the extremes that his spouse did, just because he is the lesser of those two evils doesn't mean he

01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:22.980
is the good option. So what are the choices outside of that? Well you could look towards

01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:27.380
the rest of the family, Ruby's siblings in particular appeared quite invested in safeguarding

01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:32.100
the children, and on the surface they didn't seem to have any direct connections to connections,

01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:36.740
with all of them quite openly disavowing the institution after the Moms of Truth were arrested.

01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:40.500
At the same time there were still questions surrounding their background and given how

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:44.740
similar it was to Ruby's, particularly given their YouTube channels, and how a large majority

01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:50.020
of the family members have all been involved with that content at some point. Outside of the cults,

01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:54.100
there was another network that may provoke caution within the courts and the concerned parties.

01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:58.660
Yeah, I'll send the bull over to Ruby, you ask the question, and we can all answer, or

01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:03.060
we don't have to all answer, just a few, so kind of just say what you want.

01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:06.340
Although it goes without saying that Ruby's actions are not a reflection on any of the

01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:10.900
sisters or family members at that, there was a very strong YouTube relationship built up with

01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:15.060
her and her family in the years since the founding of the channel. I think many would agree that the

01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:19.300
children need to be as far away from that as possible, the first thing they need is privacy.

01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:23.540
Unfortunately, although most of the worst actions happened after the YouTube channel, it is Ruby's

01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:27.460
influencer status that has brought her the most attention in this case. The family vlogging

01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:32.340
network has been somewhat shaken by Ruby's actions, the only person who has made an appearance

01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:36.420
elsewhere since Ruby distanced herself from her sisters was her daughter, who was an adult at the

01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:40.820
time, and could make her own decisions. It would be hard for the children to have a healthy home

01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:45.460
environment if the others still intend to upload content. Bonnie, who was probably the most vocal

01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:49.220
about her sister's actions since the arrests were made, has made some interesting decisions on

01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:53.860
speaking on the matter, including uploading a now deleted video where she recounted her childhood

01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:58.660
relationship with Ruby in rather extensive detail. She deleted the video, probably realising it

01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:02.900
wasn't necessary, and that it could also be a legally sensitive matter, but it did almost

01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:06.820
represent one of the concerns of this sort of family affair, that when you've been online for

01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:11.540
so long that sometimes you lose grasp of the line between what needs to be online and what can be

01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:12.800
left for the real world.

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:24.340
So when I say that Ruby and Kevin and Jodie and connections have been destroying our lives offline for the last three years,

01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:26.580
that is exactly what they've been doing.

01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:30.580
In the years leading up to arrests, Ruby had either distanced people so much from the family

01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:34.180
that they had no involvement in the lives of those concerned at all, or caught them in the

01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:38.740
orbit of something so toxic that question marks loomed over their heads. As the most influential

01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:43.140
family vlogger in a family of family vloggers, I suppose that was somewhat inevitable, because

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:45.780
something had been done about it sooner. Well.

01:09:56.980 --> 01:10:03.060
And it didn't make sense to me to hold my kids accountable, hold my kids accountable, and then

01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:09.220
Christmas come, and then it's not consistent, and all of a sudden they get Santa Claus coming and

01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:16.740
pouring gifts upon them. And so we're going to not be celebrating Christmas in the same way that

01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:21.460
we've done in the past. We're going to celebrate Christmas for what it really stands for, which is

01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:28.100
the Savior was born, and because the Savior was born, we get this beautiful opportunity to change,

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:32.820
our hearts get to soften, and so for Christmas we're inviting you to soften your heart.

01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:38.500
Ruby Franke was always a strict parent, and certainly didn't act in line with many people's

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:42.740
expectations of a 21st century millennial mother. Nevertheless, for the times she was known for

01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:46.180
threatening to behead fluffy toys, and not bringing a hungry daughter lunch, there would

01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:50.100
always be people who were quite vocal in defending her as working from a more traditional parenting

01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:53.540
model. To many of them, this was just a person who was raising a child, as they had been raised

01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:58.180
themselves, this was a cultural and ancestral matter that had likely been held over generations,

01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:02.500
and had seldom failed. At the same time, most of them would inevitably go on to disagree with what

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:06.500
the authorities discovered, and declare that she had fully lost the plots. You could see this shift

01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:10.740
in comment sections in conservative news outlets before and after her arrest. On the other hand,

01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:14.420
to many critics, these clips were signs that something should have been done sooner, and this

01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:18.740
behavior was a slippery slope to what inevitably occurred. I think there is a point behind this,

01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:22.820
at the same time there is a somewhat exceptional element to Rui's parenting that was often

01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:27.300
overlooked, but for me it was the most indicative that something could spiral out of control.

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:31.700
Parents are deeply flawed like the rest of us, and some of them will fuck up, some of them will be

01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:35.300
angry, some of them will be harsh, and some of them will make the wrong decisions occasionally

01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:39.860
at the expense of the wellbeing of those around them. There are no mandated parenting classes,

01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:43.300
even though you could make the argument there should be, it's fairly straightforward for many

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:47.940
adults to have a kid if they wish, but what's not straightforward is actually raising them.

01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:51.700
Most people can recall a difficult stage of their childhood, and how they may have also

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:55.380
posed a challenge to the rest of their family, what matters is how the more mature parties

01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:59.460
navigate that, and at what point they're willing to say that they need to change something about

01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:04.660
themselves to help you. Bad parenting can come from a place of ignorance, other times arrogance,

01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:08.580
other times the refusal to be a better person, something that is essential when dealing with

01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:12.580
people who are wired to act impulsively. Within reason, most of the time you'd recommend that

01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:15.940
a parent gets some professional help with how they handle children who are in a difficult

01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:19.780
stage of their life, and doesn't fall down that slope of actually exacerbating the problem,

01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:24.100
making them act out even more. However, being introduced to Ruby Frankie by the 8 Passengers

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:28.100
video about what she hadn't told us, while many were rightfully struck by the severity of her

01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:32.580
punishment against her oldest son, I was strangely unnerved about the language she used concerning

01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:36.340
her youngest, and how he processed the news that he would not have access to technology

01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:37.660
over the coming months.

01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:44.460
We had the expectation that the kids would not be on the iPads.

01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:53.660
We said the kids would not be on the iPads.

01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:57.740
Now in this video, he was noticeably evasive in confronting his mother over the matter,

01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:01.660
very possibly because he was embarrassed about being discovered breaching the house rules,

01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:06.940
yet Ruby begins to use very strange language regarding his ability to be humble and sit with

01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:14.300
her. The fact that he's not willing to sit with me and be humble and talk is a big,

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:21.420
is a big demonstration to me that he has some distorted views and that he is in a lot of shame.

01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:26.620
Both my friend and I who were listening noted the same motivation, that this was someone who

01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:32.220
has actually been to therapy, but hasn't been properly changed by it. Jonah Hill was using

01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:37.020
therapy speak to control his girlfriend Sarah, his now ex-girlfriend, and it's important that

01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:41.260
we go over this misuse of therapy language which is kind of a thing these days.

01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:45.980
Throughout 2023, there has been a rise in criticism surrounding notions of therapy speak

01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:49.820
and over-therapy. In both of these cases, they are exemplified by people who have gone to therapy

01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:54.460
to address some of their issues, but haven't necessarily ameliorated them, more so finding

01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:58.460
new ways to justify them. This reared its head during the Jonah Hill situation this year,

01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:02.780
where many felt that he had behaved possessively and masqueraded it under the pretense of setting

01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:07.020
boundaries. It's not really my place to hypothesise how this happens with every individual,

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:11.100
but I think the greatest issue is when a person goes into therapy to not necessarily change,

01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:15.420
but to reinforce the perspective that their own ideas or themselves are misunderstood.

01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:20.140
We know that Ruby id experienced criticism pre-2020 for her parenting techniques, and

01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:24.460
perhaps she was feeling insecure about this, but instead of seeking out a reputable professional,

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:29.180
she found connections, which we know by the 2020 upload was an organisation she was becoming

01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:33.420
closer with. Bad parenting can come from a multitude of sources, but if there is an element

01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:37.180
of reasonable doubt, there is the hope that maybe with some actual help they can address these

01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:41.100
problems and improve themselves. The problem with Ruby was that she'd move past that stage

01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:45.500
of confronting her problems, but instead opting to be an even harsher parent on the basis of the

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:49.900
advice she received, and using therapy speak to defend those actions. This was not just troubling

01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:54.380
for her judgement, but for those around her too. This is dangerous in the sense that it can cause

01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:59.020
people to psychologically validate abusive dynamics, which is bad enough between two people,

01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:03.260
but between a parent and their child is extremely treacherous. It gives the adult no space for

01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:08.460
self-reflection, no room for change, no opportunity to avert disaster, because she can just turn around

01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:12.540
and say that if the child doesn't respond well to her disciplinary measures then it's their problem,

01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:17.340
which as ludicrous as it sounds is exactly how Ruby thought. For outsiders, it might be very

01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:22.060
apparent how flawed this perspective is, but for a family, those who may have looked up to her and

01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:26.140
trusted her, this was psychologically soul-destroying behaviour that could very easily

01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:29.820
gaslight a young person into believing that what they were suffering through was their own faults.

01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:38.220
So victim is a word that many of us use to acknowledge when a person is using their choices

01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:44.300
to not be responsible for themselves. What happens when a youngster in a difficult place doesn't

01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:48.700
respond well to these methods like they didn't? There was no set end for Ruby's methods because

01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:53.180
she's spoken to the professionals in her mind, and they've told her that she's right, and if

01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:57.660
people don't respond to it then they just haven't got the message yet. If she had ended up going to

01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:01.900
a different therapist then this situation may have had a very different outcome, but as said,

01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:07.740
when you go to a therapist, you need to want to be better, and I don't think Ruby ever wanted that.

01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:22.860
As we know now, Ruby has pled guilty to four counts of child abuse, with two of the counts

01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:26.140
being dropped as part of the plea deal. Whether she will be instrumental in the case against

01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:30.700
Jodie is yet to be seen, but the message during this plea was unambiguous. This was a woman taken

01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:34.780
advantage of by a counsellor in a position of power and whose weaknesses were exploited to

01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:39.740
adopt increasingly radical and dangerous views. That Ruby Franky was just a devoted mother on

01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:44.460
the quest for continuous improvement who had been led astray. However, I think many would find this

01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:48.460
hard to believe with the evidence available. Allow me to explain. Ruby had always been an

01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:53.100
advocate of what she described as tough love. This method was something that she clearly felt

01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:57.820
an affinity to, and in her mind worked effectively. However, this was the 21st century, and as an

01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:02.220
individual posting content onto a modern platform, she was always bound to receive some pushback,

01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:06.060
and although she garnered the most attention in 2020, she had clearly experienced criticism

01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:09.500
before then, particularly regarding the treatment of their older son, who had been experiencing

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:16.300
some behaviour issues. I think Ruby was always somewhat aware that her techniques were unpopular

01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:20.220
for their time, which is often why she stated that such conversations would occur off camera.

01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:23.660
This would often provide an impression that there was more bliss in the family household than there

01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:27.500
actually was. This didn't mean that she wasn't prone to opening herself up to criticism,

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:30.780
and when you document your family and what is happening, particularly when you have an upload

01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:34.540
schedule to commit to, you will be drawn into these discussions, and your audience will inevitably

01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:38.700
be invested. An example of this was when she and Kevin had to stay at a hotel, while announcing

01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:42.700
that her older son had been sent to the Anasazi wilderness camp to set him straight. Regardless

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:46.140
of how good the establishment may be, there were always going to be people who would take issue

01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:50.620
given the controversy of wilderness therapy as a whole. It was also apparent that it just wasn't

01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:55.420
working on an individual basis for that son. Now when addressing results that may not line up with

01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:59.340
the preconceived notions of parenting that you're familiar with, you can either begin a period of

01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:02.780
self-reflection that may or may not lead to character growth, or you can double down on

01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:06.460
your approach and decide that it's everyone else who is in the wrong. Parenting is a matter that

01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:11.020
many people take pride in, and Ruby was certainly a proud mother, though maybe not in the sense that

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:14.940
statement may typically assume. She was very committed to her styles and the results that

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:18.940
she believed it yielded, however she was also a very committed proponent of authority, but a

01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:23.100
lot of the authority that she looked towards did not align with her outlook. Most psychologists

01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:26.620
and therapists would say that her techniques were certainly far from optimal in addressing

01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:31.020
misbehaviour, and could easily aggravate a person who is acting out. This is not something that she

01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:34.700
would have wanted to hear, and as a person who positioned herself as a voice of authority on

01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:39.340
parenting matters, she couldn't ever see herself as undermining her image. All the same she needed

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:43.500
a way to respond and justify their behaviour that had more backing than just her personal

01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:52.220
inclinations. By her own admission, Ruby was not cash-strapped as her channel accumulated

01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:56.620
hundreds of millions of views each year. She was a person who had a lot of options if she wanted to

01:18:56.620 --> 01:19:00.300
change her parenting style. I'm sure there were many top-end psychologists who would have told

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:04.140
her in short terms what the best way to navigate the challenges that she had to inevitably confront

01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:08.140
were, but Ruby already had her solution to everything. She wasn't looking for advice,

01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:11.980
she was looking for affirmation. This is how she found the connections classroom.

01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:23.340
On the surface, it would be hard to look at Hildebrandt's writing and understand the direct

01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:28.380
relationship between escaping distortion and Ruby's insecurity over her parenting for an

01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:33.020
organisation initially set up to help individuals overcome addiction. The parenting course,

01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:37.420
although full of the usual cultish buzzwords we've become used to, still seems to teach

01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:41.500
principles that you'd feel are quite inoffensive at their core. However, when you take a closer

01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:45.740
look at the syllabus, you realise that actually, the parenting really mentions nothing about what

01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:50.220
the parents do, and you realise that what appealed to Ruby was not the fact that she could fix

01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:53.340
herself, it was the fact that she thought she could fix her kids.

01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:31.420
I'm not going to pay $220 for the connections parenting classes,

01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:36.140
but the summary really tells you most of what you need to know. That children, like adults,

01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:41.340
are in this constant state of distortion, and that your job as a parent is to lead them out of it.

01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:44.860
How do you do that? Well, you have to show them the way forward, but ultimately they are steps

01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:49.020
you cannot make for them. Probably the most illuminating quote in the course summary reads,

01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:53.820
the motivation to self-care must come from each individual. Nobody can do it for you,

01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:58.620
and you cannot do it for your children. They must learn, and it's our responsibility to teach them

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:03.420
how to care for themselves. This seems to ideologically line up to the mother who wouldn't

01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:07.820
take lunch to her six-year-old when she forgot to make it. Beyond that, though, there is this very

01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:12.460
interesting combination of ideas in how connections and Hildebrandt view parenting. It's not really a

01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:16.780
parent's job to care for their children, but it's also a parent's job to teach a child to care for

01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:22.380
themselves. How do you teach someone that way without caring, without providing some form of

01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:50.780
actual support? Within connections, Ruby Franke found the ends to justify those means,

01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:55.260
and as she came under stronger criticisms, she dug her heels in more. After all, now she could

01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:58.860
respond to those people calling her out saying that she had talked to licensed professionals,

01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:02.620
who advised that it was actually a completely just punishment to confiscate a bed for seven

01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:07.020
months from their son who played pranks on their brother. From her perspective, it simultaneously

01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:11.820
washed her hands of responsibility while proving her methods correct, but many outsiders saw it

01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:16.780
for the farce and cop-out that it was, and voted with their viewership. This pushed Ruby further,

01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:20.620
taking up more responsibility in the connections classroom, strengthening her bond with Jodie,

01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:24.540
who not just adored her commitment to the cause, but also her subscriber count and the clout that

01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:29.340
she pulled. It was true that Ruby Franke was drawn into a cult-like mentality, but only because she

01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:34.540
felt the world around her needed to change, rather than herself. As an internet literate person with

01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:38.620
access to review websites and media platforms that say more than I have, there were plenty of

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:42.380
signs that she could have picked up to tell her that this was a course that may not be the best

01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:47.820
for those around her. The connections had torn families apart, but Ruby didn't care about that,

01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:53.340
she cared about herself, and how she had to be right in her ways. If that isn't distortion,

01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:59.260
then I don't know what is. Ruby Franke didn't want to be better, she wanted to be the best,

01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:02.700
and yet that hubris led her to be one of the worst.

01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:09.340
Jodie's latest victim was this eight channels lady. I knew in two seconds, I knew in two

01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:17.580
seconds, that Jodie absolutely wanted that lady's platform to become more powerful, and then she

01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:24.620
would lie to that lady, she would make that lady as mentally sick as a dog, then she would lie to

01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:28.620
her like she was helping her, and then she would steal that lady's power. For more information

01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:33.020
on Jodie and how dangerous she truly was, I recommend watching J Aubrey's video on the matter,

01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:36.300
and I'll also link a few other illuminating pieces in the pinned comment as well.

01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:52.140
Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting different results. Although

01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:56.780
its origins aren't known for certain, it's often accredited to Albert Einstein, and although there's

01:23:56.860 --> 01:24:01.900
obviously a nuance to it, I think he had a point. Following the arrest of Ruby Franke, one of her

01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:05.820
sisters in law recalled a time where she had come round for dinner, and had proceeded to chastise

01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:09.980
her for letting her own children have snacks after food, claiming that they were running a mock

01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:15.180
in the kitchen. Ruby didn't just view her parenting as the right way, she viewed it as the only way,

01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:20.380
and she viewed her platform as a way to spread that message, but like many hypothesised narcissists,

01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:25.100
their usual channel isn't really a way to spread that message, it's more to create a whole new one

01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:29.420
entirely. When going over the 8 Passengers YouTube channel, you'll find countless moments

01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:33.020
of bliss and harmony within the family. The overarching theme was that this was a group of

01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:37.980
people who were happy with each other's company, documented by a doting mother who just wanted to

01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:42.140
capture those fleeting snapshots as a permanent time capsule for the collective memory, but there

01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:53.180
was something deeper to the channel and how she approached it. One of the challenges regarding

01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:57.740
watching family channels, is how they often present an ideated version of how a family

01:24:57.740 --> 01:25:02.300
operates, particularly for those who either want to be parents, or are parents already,

01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:06.460
and looking for guidance. There's a lot of selective footage, in a way that's what you'd

01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:09.900
expect, not everything needs to be a part of a YouTube channel, particularly if you want to

01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:14.380
reflect on those memories fondly. Nevertheless, a lot of people saw the image that the Franke's

01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:19.340
projected onto their channel, and often asked Ruby how her children were so wonderful and obedient.

01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:23.580
The secret was that most of the time, you don't talk about the times where that parental style

01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:29.180
falls short, and from the evidence available, it did so on multiple occasions. An often overlooked

01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:33.820
detail in the May 2020 upload, What We Haven't Told You, was Ruby talking about the instances

01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:37.580
her oldest son had played a variety of pranks on his brother, and choosing to list an example

01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:41.100
that literally happened on the day he came back from the Anasazi wilderness camp.

01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:59.980
Those are not signs of a person who is responding well to your castigation, not to mention that

01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:04.540
Anasazi was already the result of years of misbehaviour by their own accounts. Of course,

01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:08.380
people wouldn't receive this impression if you watched 8 Passengers content most of the time,

01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:12.060
because that's not what they showed, but the son clearly didn't appreciate this, and one of the

01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:16.220
few details from the insider interview that I actually believe was that her son had encouraged

01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:20.700
to upload the video in its current form. My personal belief is that I think he anticipated

01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:24.700
the backlash it would receive, in the past he'd encourage his mother to talk about the discipline

01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:29.340
he was subjected to, while she was often the more evasive. So although I can say that I think Ruby

01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:33.420
was extremely hard headed in the best way to raise her children, she was also very aware of the

01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:38.060
negative press that this would generate, but she just couldn't reconcile both without sacrificing

01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:43.340
her pride or her reputation. So the natural outcome is she's just going to need to be hungry,

01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:51.180
and hopefully nobody gives her food, and nobody steps in and gives her a lunch. Probably the most

01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:55.260
illuminating example of this was her response to the withholding of sustenance from her daughter,

01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:58.940
and the accompanying clip. In the insider interview, she attempts to reframe it as a

01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:02.700
matter she was actually very sympathetic to, and would've helped if she could have,

01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:06.140
and although there may be context around the clip that we're not aware of, there's also just

01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:10.860
a callousness in the clip itself that could not be alternatively contextualised. She knew that

01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:15.260
this was often frowned upon, and when the fire was put to her feet, she exhibited cowardice.

01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:20.140
If she really was as committed to the regime as she said she was, why would she backtrack?

01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:25.020
Because the YouTube channel was more important, how she was perceived was more important than how

01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:30.780
she was, yet she was never wrong, she couldn't be wrong. There was this continuous narrative that

01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:34.860
people just didn't get it, they didn't have an understanding, they weren't mature enough,

01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:39.100
they didn't possess the full context, and although all these are viable responses in a case by case

01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:43.340
scenario, here they felt more like rhetorical devices to keep Ruby and Kevin in the right.

01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:47.180
There was always something that people didn't know that meant that the Frankies could not be

01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:51.020
judged. Their evidence of good parenting was right in front of them, their content,

01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:55.580
and their children, perhaps one in the same in their mind. Ruby Frankie used the YouTube

01:27:55.580 --> 01:28:00.700
channel to create a reality where her disciplinary methods resulted in a happy family, with her

01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:04.860
and her husband even boasting that when CPS came by their house, they remarked that they would

01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:09.980
actually have to start watching their YouTube content to get some tips on parenting, a comment

01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:14.620
so close to satire itself that it may well be true. Yet after the run-in with the internet,

01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:18.220
they all stepped back from this narrative entirely, and often avoided any mention of

01:28:18.220 --> 01:28:23.020
discipline at all. In turn, the YouTube channel became this medium to fabricate a family that

01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:27.500
only really existed in Ruby's mind to present to the audience for their consumption, the one where

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:31.420
she holds them to account, they embrace their retribution, and then they grow up to be these

01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:36.140
wonderful members of society, all thanks to her and her wonderful mothering techniques.

01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:40.380
In this case, the 8 Passengers channel became a damaging platform for the family's wellbeing,

01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:45.180
because what once was an illusion had now become a delusion. Ruby was using the platform to throw

01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:49.020
up a smokescreen not just for her viewers, but for herself, but if you looked at the evidence,

01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:53.660
everything was going perfectly fine. Yet this just made it less believable because they hadn't

01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:57.420
committed to changing anything at all, and if nothing had changed about their methods,

01:28:57.420 --> 01:29:01.740
how could they suddenly present this image that everything was hunky-dory now? The people on

01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:06.220
YouTube did not buy it, and as the views fell, so did the validation. Like many people with

01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:10.620
narcissistic tendencies, Ruby was steadfast but fragile, and still needed to hear that

01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:15.340
everything was fine, boasting about her methods on podcasts with her new partner in crime.

01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:20.940
I was really hoping that like, keeping them home from school and wiping the floorboards would like,

01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:27.020
really bring pain. Like, oh my gosh, I really want to change this behaviour that I've been

01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:31.740
exhibiting. And then it didn't, it didn't, like, it wasn't painful for them. They're like, oh yeah,

01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:35.020
we get to stay home from school and clean floorboards. This is kind of fun. It's like, ah,

01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:41.260
so, you know, they've had these visceral experiences, you know, and they haven't,

01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:46.220
they haven't affected them. It's because they're so numb. The truth was that it wasn't fine,

01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:50.460
but nobody could prove it, because Ruby was too proud to admit that she was losing control of

01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:54.060
everything, and that she would rather go down with her methods than change her ways,

01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:57.900
that she would rather commit to a cult that validates her perceptions than actually get

01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:02.780
serious help. In her mind, her punishments were just the consequences rather than the cause,

01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:05.980
and yet everyone had to live with them.

01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:16.140
Probably the most indicative piece of evidence that showed her character was her own court

01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:20.060
appearance, where she implied that such harsh abuse against one of her own children could be

01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:24.300
justified by launching into a series of allegations regarding sexual misconduct. I

01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:28.700
obviously cannot comment on the verity of such claims, but it encapsulated the perfect mix of

01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:33.740
cowardice and callousness, the refusal to admit that she had failed as a parent alongside the

01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:38.140
context that means she was right all along. To me, this defence was a symptom that Jodie

01:30:38.140 --> 01:30:42.460
and Ruby were careening towards some sort of modern-day exorcism scenario, where they could

01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:46.940
create this reality that they had to purge evil from this person rather than actually seeing the

01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:51.020
evil in themselves that was driving them to do this. This was confirmed on the 90th of December

01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:54.940
when details of Ruby's behaviour were revealed, of which I'm not going to verbally list out and

01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:58.300
would recommend the faint of heart to turn away, but could be seen on the screen now,

01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:02.700
it is as horrifying as one may conceptualise. The justification for these acts was that those

01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:07.020
she did this to were possessed, sometimes to justify one act of evil you have to create a

01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:11.820
greater one, and as a person who was hellbent on being right, no matter how awful Ruby was,

01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:15.900
in her mind she was always fighting against something worse, but really she was just

01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:19.980
fighting her own reflection. We could sit here and debate whether an adult will reflect on the

01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:24.540
time their mum wouldn't bring them lunch, but as a pattern of behaviour it was toxic, and what Ruby

01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:28.940
and Jodie did together will probably live with the effect of parties for the foreseeable future,

01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:33.020
and that is a tragedy. The psychological justifications of such cruelty to those

01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:37.500
vulnerable will likely take a long time to fully disentangle, to realise that actually this wasn't

01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:42.140
their fault. Ruby Franky may not have entered parenthood with bad intentions, but her vanity

01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:46.220
was corrupted by an online following and her failure to choose to actually put her family

01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:49.900
first. To die on a hill that she had known for so long would eventually lead to one of the most

01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:54.540
horrific outcomes, one whose legacy will remain long after she's forgotten by the internet.

01:31:55.100 --> 01:31:59.660
The truth is that most people who end up doing pretty shitty things aren't born that way,

01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:03.660
there are a lot of people out there who are just perpetuating a cycle that has been passed down

01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:08.780
to them. Does it change the notion of accountability? Not necessarily, but it also

01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:13.340
doesn't change the tragedy, that if they'd had a healthier upbringing they wouldn't have ended up

01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:18.300
the way they were. People like Ruby risk maintaining the cycle, and if a child commits

01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:22.060
something awful under the sort of duress that we know that Jodie and Ruby placed them under,

01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:26.620
then that couple will also bear responsibility for those misdeeds as well. How are humans meant

01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:30.940
to learn healthy relationships if all they've ever known is abuse? For a person who preached

01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:36.300
responsibility, Ruby couldn't acknowledge any, that she ultimately had fallen far short.

01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:40.700
I don't believe that she was always this way, but it's like driving a car towards an unfinished

01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:44.700
bridge while everyone else is bailing out of it. Ruby smashed the accelerator.

01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:54.300
Parenting isn't always an easy job, shout out to those who had very troubled childhoods, and

01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:59.260
even early adulthoods as well. But parenting is a necessary job, sometimes the only constant you

01:32:59.260 --> 01:33:03.980
have in your life is your family, they're integral to grounding a sense of self. I don't think there's

01:33:03.980 --> 01:33:07.980
a one size fits all approach, and different solutions will work with different challenges,

01:33:07.980 --> 01:33:12.380
but I do think navigating the exasperation of being a parent in those situations should never

01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:17.100
manifest into resentment and vitriol, something which harsher systems can risk if not responded

01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:22.540
well to. It's a cycle of punishment that will only beget harsher punishments. The Frankies went into

01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:26.700
parenting with a perception of discipline that was more corporal and traditional, this is something

01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:31.180
they agreed to and enforced together. This was also something they decided to partially document,

01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:34.780
in the years after their channel was set up, they garnered a significant following of people

01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:39.420
who admired their practices, capturing the good times, but showing parents, and aspiring parents

01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:43.980
who may be a bit lost on handling troubled youngsters, a way forward. As the older sister,

01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:48.380
her authority was affirmed as she grew to be the most influential channel in her family network,

01:33:48.380 --> 01:33:53.260
and she gladly accepted the reigns as a reliable voice on parenting, yet all of this changed when

01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:56.540
she decided to upload more information than people probably should have known.

01:33:57.340 --> 01:34:02.540
Show that he was not able to manage himself sharing a bedroom with...

01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:07.260
In the month after, Ruby partook in a campaign to defend her character against many who felt

01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:11.340
that her authoritarian approach crossed a line, utilising unreasonable and disproportionate

01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:15.580
punishment for what was at worst mild mischief. Judging from her language in responses and

01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:19.260
interviews, she was winning the ideological battle in her mind, and that there were no

01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:23.500
words that anyone else could say that could break that family. That may have well been true,

01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:27.260
but as the eight passengers YouTube channel stagnated and began to lose subscribers,

01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:31.340
there was a sign that people weren't completely happy with what the channel had presented. Ruby

01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:35.820
and Kevin both seemed to lament this with great disdain, booing themselves as victims of cancel

01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:40.300
culture over a year after the incident. It was clear that Ruby in particular still felt deeply

01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:45.340
bitter about this. She was wronged online, and she needed to prove that she was right all along.

01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:50.540
We are getting mentally fit the same way your body would get physically fit by running and

01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:56.060
lifting weights and working with a personal trainer. We are getting ready to be your

01:34:56.060 --> 01:35:00.780
mental fitness trainer. That's where connections came in. Headed by someone who believed we all

01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:04.860
could have complete control over ourselves, Frankie's ideas surrounding parenting were

01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:09.180
validated by a doctrine that showed you had to rescue your children from the distorted world

01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:13.740
they were growing up in, that it wasn't her that was wrong, it was the world, it was the commentators,

01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:18.380
it was her sisters, it was her oldest daughter, it was even her husband in the end. The Frankie's

01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:21.980
went into parenting with a perception of discipline that was more corporal and traditional.

01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:26.700
This is something they agreed to, but they emerged separate, a family broken apart by one person's

01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:31.500
inability to change, at least for the better, a person who would rather be enabled than challenged.

01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:36.460
Even then, with federal charges filed against her, sat in court, and facing down those her actions

01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:41.500
had affected, it was still someone else's fault. For this time, it wasn't the viewers, it wasn't

01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:46.460
the commenters, it wasn't the critics, it was the children, the children who made Ruby's child

01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:50.300
possible in the first place, the children who viewers tuned in to watch, who likely didn't

01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:54.540
receive a modicum of the millions that Ruby outwardly states she made. After being provided

01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:59.660
by so much from her family, Ruby Frankie was ready to throw them under the school bus, an irony still

01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:04.060
somewhat beyond comprehension, if there was a genuine human being who cared about anyone but

01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:09.580
herself, they were buried very deep down. Ruby really was willing to lose everything for the

01:36:09.580 --> 01:36:15.660
sake of being right, and she might well do, but nobody really wins, someone is losing a sister,

01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:19.740
someone is losing a daughter, someone is losing a mother, but for many,

01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:24.540
Ruby Frankie was already gone. So, what was left?

01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:39.820
I think today is going to be one of those days I'm not a very good mom.

01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:43.260
Regardless of the centres that Ruby receives in the following year, she will still likely live

01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:47.820
another few decades to say the least, she will go on with her life, and hopefully not ruin any

01:36:47.820 --> 01:36:52.220
others in the process. Everyone online will mostly move on, and her name will spark a sort of

01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:57.180
reminiscence amongst internet culture enthusiasts. Nevertheless, even though her channels have been

01:36:57.180 --> 01:37:02.140
deleted, the remnants of her philosophy, and the actions that philosophy led to, will live on.

01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:06.940
Ironic that her channel originally created to compile fond family memories now only serves as

01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:11.820
a highlight reel for Ruby's worst moments. It's hard to say whether this is a good thing or not,

01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:15.980
some might say that YouTube served as important documentation for what will inevitably be used

01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:19.820
to hold her accountable, but you could also say that she may have never reached that stage

01:37:19.820 --> 01:37:24.140
if she hadn't made the decision to open the channel. I think one of the most harmful aspects

01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:28.220
of a family channel is inevitably how it alters the family's trajectory in general,

01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:31.980
particularly if the subjects of those videos aren't performative themselves.

01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:36.860
8 Passengers was one of those channels, defined by the publication of intimate details with millions

01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:40.860
watching. I don't think you can ever guarantee being entirely the same person when a camera

01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:46.060
switched on, and having an on-camera and off-camera parent is not a healthy dynamic in my mind.

01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:50.540
At least with acting, there is a clear distinction between what is real and what isn't. With this

01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:55.180
sort of YouTube channel, how can a youngster tell which is the real parent and which isn't?

01:37:55.180 --> 01:38:03.180
I totally ignored you today. Are you okay with that? Because you know I don't do it every day.

01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:09.260
Do you think it's okay for mom to take care of herself for a day? Okay, thanks for being

01:38:09.260 --> 01:38:13.820
thoughtful. Ruby Frankie was never a particularly good parent, it needs to be said,

01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:18.140
reflecting on even the more pedestrian content she seems incredibly vain and full of herself

01:38:18.140 --> 01:38:22.060
when it comes to the subject of raising children, and was never really open to alternative views

01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:25.500
or methods that would probably have been much better for her family as a whole.

01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:30.460
YouTube can't personality test people who decide to upload content, there has to be a degree of

01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:34.380
personal responsibility to protect the freedoms of others, and although you wouldn't necessarily

01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:38.620
say that YouTube makes a good person bad, the public attention it generates can definitely

01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:42.860
corrupt an individual and exploit character flaws that make them more prone to behaving in

01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:46.940
destructive ways. That's a pretty significant detail when dealing with channels that actively

01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:52.380
feature vulnerable parties. With 8 Passengers, Ruby's vanity was fed by a viewership who admired

01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:56.620
the couple's parenting, and thought they were seeing the results, perhaps even a way back for

01:38:56.620 --> 01:39:01.420
them to the happy family that they desired. By 2019, the channel wasn't just a harmless memory

01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:05.820
bank, it was a well-oiled commercial machine, but also a platform for Ruby to spread content

01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:10.220
that in her mind was absolutely necessary for parents to see. This was her mission,

01:39:10.220 --> 01:39:14.940
it regularly led to her uploading videos that in hindsight many felt were too invasive or revealing,

01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:19.500
and they were, but this was her own personal crusade, it's how she gave her self-purpose.

01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:23.660
She modelled the importance of her parenting on the view and sub-counts she acquired,

01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:27.740
and for a while that validated her. However, like all Passengers perspectives, it wasn't a

01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:32.140
criticism-free zone either, a lot of people raised issue with how she behaved in content and her

01:39:32.140 --> 01:39:36.940
penal system, first surfacing after she sent her oldest son to Anasazi, but most famously emerging

01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:46.220
when they spoke about her disciplinary system in a video. This was a double-edged sword as well,

01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:50.620
because although people did the right thing and criticised it, with commentators being made aware

01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:55.100
of something that could actually be scrutinised, it didn't aid the family relationship. This is not

01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:59.340
the sort of thing that really should have been spoken about in a video uploaded to YouTube,

01:39:59.340 --> 01:40:03.340
it's embarrassing for the son, but also not remotely useful for the mother. Really,

01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:07.420
this is the sort of matter that should have been brought up in a private space where Ruby didn't

01:40:07.420 --> 01:40:11.180
have to put on the front that YouTube required of her, because she wasn't going to listen to

01:40:11.180 --> 01:40:15.660
people who didn't know those in her life from Adam. It's hard to say if there was anyone in

01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:19.660
this world that Ruby would listen to who didn't agree with her, but there were definitely people

01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:23.980
she wouldn't. However, just as YouTube was an ego-boost during the channel's viral era,

01:40:23.980 --> 01:40:28.220
it's demise after this controversy would have put a significant dent in the ego of Frankie,

01:40:28.220 --> 01:40:31.900
who in probably the most symptomatic turn of someone who felt their pride was under attack,

01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:36.300
decided to create a platform entirely dedicated to defending her parenting practice and YouTube

01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:40.940
channel under the cult backdrop, even replacing her family channel's Instagram with it. I can't

01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:44.860
tell you how aware Ruby was of her own indoctrination, but it's occurrence was a

01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:49.180
result of her not being able to stomach her own failure on a website that her self-worth as a

01:40:49.180 --> 01:40:53.580
parent had become dangerously intertwined with, but her narcissism prevented her from taking

01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:54.940
responsibility for.

01:40:54.940 --> 01:41:00.220
Ruby- The power comes in the little things, and it's so fitting that I hit a million while I was

01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:04.620
trying to squeeze in as many of those little things as I could.

01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:08.540
It should go without saying, but a subscriber count or a view count is not a reflection of

01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:13.740
your ability. Popularity and skill are not always correlated. In the case of Ruby Frankie,

01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:17.900
her family generated popularity that she attributed to herself, but her subsequent

01:41:17.900 --> 01:41:21.820
failure was something she could only blame on others. You can't point towards YouTube as being

01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:25.660
responsible for that, but you do have to question how healthy that is for anyone, when the

01:41:25.660 --> 01:41:30.700
consequences that mentality yields are only felt by those who don't have a say in it. It wasn't the

01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:35.740
viewers, it wasn't the commenters, it wasn't the critics, it was the children, and just like she

01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:41.180
blamed them in court, she likely blamed them at home as well. Ruby Frankie was a bad parent,

01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:46.860
who only became worse over time and reminded some of us how fortunate we are, but she was also a

01:41:46.860 --> 01:41:51.740
symptom of the morality of family content and the moral dubiousness that surrounds it. We may not

01:41:51.740 --> 01:41:56.700
be able to ascertain the magnitude of the role her public status played in her eventual downward

01:41:56.700 --> 01:42:01.020
spiral, but it's certainly a stark reminder that if you love the channel more than your children,

01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:05.740
you probably shouldn't have either. Family channels. Needless to say,

01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:10.060
they still haven't won me over quite yet. Thank you for watching.

01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:17.660
Hey there guys, so that was the video, I hope you enjoyed it. Well, at least took something

01:42:17.660 --> 01:42:22.300
away from it, maybe not the most enjoyable subject. I want to give a big thanks to the

01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:27.100
editors, their names are up on the screen right now, and of course the wonderful people who've

01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:34.140
helped me out post-editing, Kojak, fantastic work as always, Onuski on audio, and Starfo on

01:42:34.140 --> 01:42:39.740
the thumbnails. Thank you again guys, your work is very much treasured and I really do appreciate it.

01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:45.500
Also gotta give big thanks to the patrons, as always, $10 patrons up on screen right now,

01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:51.420
and a special thanks to the $50 patrons, Hypercube, Esther Bedoya, and Sari Tish,

01:42:51.420 --> 01:42:55.980
thank you again for your support, it really means a lot. Also wanna give a big thanks to the artists

01:42:55.980 --> 01:43:00.940
whose art has been in this video. Like everyone here, all the credits are in the pinned comment,

01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:04.860
and if you wanna go and check out their work, then I encourage you to. I don't think there's

01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:11.660
too much else to say, other than I hope you guys have a good Christmas, or break, or none of those

01:43:11.740 --> 01:43:15.820
things, maybe you're not about second breaks, it's fine by me, whatever works for you,

01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:20.460
and I hope 2023 has been good to you, but if not, I hope the next one's a bit better. Until then,

01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:24.140
I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you, in the next one.
