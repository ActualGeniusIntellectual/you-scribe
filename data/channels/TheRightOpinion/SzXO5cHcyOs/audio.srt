00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,320
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the right opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,020
too much free time, and family channels, they still haven't won me over quite yet.

3
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:26,320
Whether it's the ACE family's exploitation of influencer status, the store for false

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,760
enchantment surrounding adoption, or their former facade of faithfulness, there is a

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,480
sense that the presence of cameras can corrupt one's perception of what a family means,

6
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,700
and the honesty and values that would typically be shared behind closed doors.

7
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,040
The only value that such channels will offer is as a guide to parents, and soon to be parents,

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,520
who want to be the best they can be, sometimes as a template on how to practice parenting,

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,680
and sometimes as a template on how not to.

10
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,840
You'd still be within your rights to ask the question whether this trade-off is worth

11
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,040
it for the broadcast of what is a very personal attachment during formative years, and if

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,520
it would actually be more effective to seek guidance from professionals in the field.

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,120
But if family channels are here to stay, let's hope they can provide some instruction for

14
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,120
the next generation of parents.

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,600
The truth is though that most channels in this genre are disinterested in serving that

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,020
purpose, they're more there to entertain audience members, and although some may try

17
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,900
to defend certain videos as edutainment, a lot of modern family channels just take a

18
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,220
rather generic formula of content creation and add children.

19
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,320
With that said, there are exceptions to this rule, couples and channels who do promote

20
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,140
navigating challenges within their families, and either provide advice or insight into

21
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,000
how certain issues are resolved.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Of course, there is no one-size-fits-all manual on how to properly parent, and over the past

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,680
century the brailing wisdom on how best to instill clear morals and values into the youth

24
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,900
of today has evolved significantly, alongside our own morals and values, with many families

25
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,440
from all over the world moving towards more moderate blueprints on discipline from within

26
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,440
the family.

27
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,640
This has received broad support from pediatric psychologists, although it's still been

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,320
met with some resistance from people who feel that the traditional model worked on a practical

29
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,280
basis for them, and therefore there's no reason for why they should deviate from it.

30
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,860
With the opportunity for families from all backgrounds to broadcast themselves online,

31
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,260
you are inevitably going to experience a wide pool of parenting techniques, some of which

32
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:06,000
may lean towards the more traditional methods that resonate with the cohort of the population.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,800
At the same time, traditional parenting is a system that has needed to evolve as well,

34
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,720
particularly given how aspects of that system, including physical reprimand, is now widely

35
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,560
reviled and considered outdated.

36
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,960
It's uncertain therefore whether it's more fitting or ironic that one of the most progressive

37
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,160
places to video share has become a bastion for people promoting more traditional parenting

38
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,000
styles, especially with the common narrative that today's youth are out of control.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,060
The truth is, though, that ultimately, regardless of what an expert might say, everyone is always

40
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,320
going to have their own ideas of how to do something, and without the constraints of

41
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,280
network approval or peer reviews, parents are free to share their own techniques on

42
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
YouTube.

43
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,480
But what does the modern form of traditional parenting look like?

44
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,800
Well, for a few years towards the end of the 2010s, one individual thought she had it down

45
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,060
to a T.

46
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,400
So let's head on down to the wonderful state of Utah, to a mother of six and content creator

47
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,980
by the name of Ruby Franky.

48
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,060
Ruby Franky was the matriarch of the 8 Passengers YouTube channel, a channel which documented

49
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,180
the rearing of her six children alongside her husband Kevin.

50
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,780
This channel was launched in 2015 at a time where family channels were experiencing a

51
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,300
lot of popularity on the video sharing platform.

52
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,100
Although not becoming an overnight sensation, she steadily accrued over 2 million subscribers

53
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,980
in the coming years, and found herself becoming a guiding light for many aspiring parents

54
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,100
on the subject of how to raise children.

55
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,620
Her techniques stem from a more traditional perspective that focused on punitive measures

56
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,180
to teach her family the importance of responsibility.

57
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,120
Her family were part of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as

58
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,540
the Mormon Church, and although she didn't necessarily sing from the rooftops about it

59
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,780
in her content, her faith clearly played an influential role in her life.

60
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,340
Nevertheless, she was also a modern parent in how she promoted these techniques and explained

61
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,380
her thought process, appearing more methodical and philosophical in her reflections on her

62
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,460
actions, which her fans appeared to create some degree of understanding and respect,

63
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,900
enshrining her as a millennial model for the traditionally minded mother.

64
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:16,580
In spite of this, as her channel amplified its reach, she began to draw criticism for

65
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,920
the treatment of her children, which often involved measures that many felt were extremely

66
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,920
disproportionate to their actions.

67
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,720
These measures often resulted in a deprivation of aspects to one's life that many would consider

68
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,700
quite basic, and would widely be criticised as having an outwardly detrimental effect

69
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,700
on their development.

70
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:51,740
In spite of this, she would defend her parental technique due to its results, those being

71
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,860
the perceived respect that her children demonstrated towards her in content and how it had seemingly

72
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,980
resolved behavioural issues and challenges.

73
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:02,280
Ultimately, from her and her husband's perspective, this style was conducive to a happy family,

74
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,580
something they promoted on their channel to millions of viewers.

75
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,100
If you wanted an operational family life, then this was the way, but what happens in

76
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,140
front of the cameras is only ever a fragment of the full story.

77
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,940
Yes, in the years that followed the spotlight being placed on her parental techniques from

78
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,980
content creators, Ruby Franky's life began to implode quite spectacularly, with a disintegration

79
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,620
of nearly everything that she knew, culminating in 2023 with the deletion of her remaining

80
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,820
YouTube channels, alongside her arrest and detention, the judge deeming what she was

81
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,900
accused of as too severe to even be granted bail.

82
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,060
It seems that Ruby Franky didn't just possess a parental style, she was possessed by something

83
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:42,300
far more sinister, and today we will be delving into that, and the consequences of those

84
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,300
actions.

85
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,220
I'll add that given the legal sensitivity and potential victimization of individuals,

86
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,940
certain figures will be having their identities censored in this video, that information is

87
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,980
not relevant to what I'll be discussing today regardless.

88
00:05:53,980 --> 00:06:00,100
So fellow internet friends and fiends, I suggest we examine the online remains of Ruby Franky,

89
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,220
which is exactly what was really going on.

90
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,940
On her YouTube channel, Ruby Franky was a mother, first and foremost.

91
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:27,020
My house right now is a combination of smells of banana peel, wet diaper, and garbages that

92
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:33,140
There was a fair bit more to her than initially met the eye.

93
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,700
First of all, she was part of a significant vlogging syndicate with her wider family,

94
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,780
all of whom had started somewhat successful channels themselves.

95
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,700
Ruby had posted a couple videos onto YouTube over a decade ago, mostly grainy videos of

96
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,860
her playing piano pieces, and an interesting upload about Chick-fil-A.

97
00:06:46,860 --> 00:07:09,140
There was some other content as well, but these were presented at the time as standalone

98
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,140
uploads.

99
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,220
In her description, she states that this is because she was already a happy mother of

100
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,580
four wonderful children.

101
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,020
Her sister Ellie had launched a couples channel with her husband Jared, in part to document

102
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,380
their struggle of overcoming infertility, which was well received at the time.

103
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,640
In the following years, each of the Franky siblings launched their own channels, Ruby

104
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,940
being the last to do so.

105
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,920
In spite of being the oldest and seemingly having a stable family life by this point,

106
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,340
in an interview she gave approximately a year after beginning to upload on the video sharing

107
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,940
platform, her rationale appeared to reflect a perspective that she wanted to live in the

108
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,940
moment, stating,

109
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:50,740
The channel therefore to her stood to serve as an archive of those happy family memories

110
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,660
and milestones, something that you definitely received the impression of by watching a sample

111
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,200
platter of her content.

112
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,140
Now given the deletion of the 8 Passengers YouTube channel, we don't have a full catalogue

113
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,960
of content available to us, but I selected a few videos that would hopefully give me

114
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,620
and yourselves, if you choose, an insight into the family dynamics.

115
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,820
On the one hand, it wasn't hard to see why the woman of the house had accrued a following.

116
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,740
You guys, this is like a landmark in our family.

117
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,660
Getting rid of the car seats is one.

118
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,660
It's huge.

119
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,780
Getting rid of car seats is huge.

120
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,780
We're not quite there yet.

121
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,340
We're still in booster seats.

122
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,360
We're out of diapers.

123
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,080
You guys, none of my kids had training wheels.

124
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,140
Having children all at different stages in their life allowed her to show the diversity

125
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,300
of experiences the raising them presented.

126
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,760
It allowed her to demonstrate her abilities to navigate situations, while addressing her

127
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,060
own shortcomings as a mother occasionally.

128
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,940
The channel page would provide this impression.

129
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,560
One popular series of videos advertised was the Sorry, Not Sorry, So Sorry, which accepted

130
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,180
that in a family where no one is perfect, they all have to learn to say those two words.

131
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:53,500
In content itself, Ruby's demeanour often presents itself as calm but also firm.

132
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,100
You wouldn't necessarily receive an idea of her parental style from just randomly clicking

133
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,100
on a video.

134
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,540
She wasn't loud, she wasn't necessarily aggressive, she was obviously involved as

135
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,400
parents went, but it didn't necessarily purport itself as overbearing.

136
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,200
With that said, Ruby still had a narrative that she appeared to craft using her content,

137
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,160
often making loaded statements to her children to seek agreement and validation from them,

138
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,080
though not always specifically asking how they truly felt.

139
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,760
I was talking to Daddy about you last night, and you know what we said?

140
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,760
What?

141
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:26,080
How much we are just amazed by you and your love of learning.

142
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,480
You do it because you love to learn, don't you?

143
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,440
It's not about grades for you, is it?

144
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
It's all about...

145
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,440
Sort of?

146
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,400
You enjoy it, I can tell, I'm very proud of you.

147
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,680
It's clear that she wanted herself and her children to be perceived a certain way by

148
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,400
the audience, perhaps as a reflection on her own parenting abilities, something that was

149
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,720
always prone to public scrutiny as a content creator.

150
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,160
In a world of far more avaricious channels who exploited drama and conflict, Eight Passengers

151
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,420
often avoided conflict by simply choosing not to focus on those parts of their lives.

152
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,160
The reason that Ruby Frankie's sentiments often flew under the radar is because it was

153
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,300
not the centerpiece of her content, many unassuming viewers simply would not notice anything unreasonable

154
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,360
about her demeanor a majority of the time, and she would often seek to avoid publicizing

155
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,960
that side of her completely.

156
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,320
She laid down boundaries regarding what the child would document, stating that certain

157
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,980
conversations would be dealt with off-camera.

158
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,500
What do you think about it?

159
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,340
Well, we'll discuss it when we get home.

160
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,340
I know, yeah, I saw the text.

161
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,100
It's not something I want to discuss on the vlog.

162
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,100
Why?

163
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:35,900
Because it involves behaviour, attitude, and consequences, which we don't tend to vlog very much.

164
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:40,060
These often related to possible emotional challenges and disciplinary measures.

165
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,440
Ruby made the active decision to often keep these potentially sensitive discussions off

166
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,020
the channel, for some that would be a reasonable decision as the presence of a video camera

167
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:51,580
could very easily influence how two people interact, however it also might prompt a discerning

168
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:55,300
audience member to wonder exactly what those conversations entailed.

169
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,700
The glimpses we did receive into Ruby's message definitely appear to lean into austerity.

170
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,060
One such measure that jumped out was when one of her daughters went through a manicure

171
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,780
kit, making a mess on the floor and carpet, before hiding under the bed, likely out of

172
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,780
embarrassment.

173
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,980
Although visibly bothered, Ruby doesn't seem enraged, nonetheless, her punishment

174
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,860
of denying her nail painting services to said daughter for the following month would definitely

175
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,820
strike some parents as quite strict, especially as Ruby says that it's her daughter's

176
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,820
favourite activity.

177
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,340
However, the daughter seems to accept this, and there's no apparent bad blood on camera.

178
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:29,060
You're still going to have the consequence of not having your nails done for a month.

179
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,060
Do you understand that?

180
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,060
Yes.

181
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:38,780
And I still, I still want to buy you one of the another rugs.

182
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,980
You still want to buy me a new rug?

183
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,980
Maybe you can do some extra chores to help with the money.

184
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,980
Um, Mom.

185
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,980
It's a deal.

186
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,980
Give me a hug.

187
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,980
Um, Mom.

188
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,460
It appeared that Ruby valued accountability and consequence.

189
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,300
She wanted to make sure that her children were aware of these tenets, and she wasn't

190
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,300
the only person who appreciated that.

191
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,820
Yes, despite launching her channel after those of her sisters, by 2020, 8 Passengers was

192
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,140
the most subscribed channel out of Frankie's entire family.

193
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,700
Ruby's tough love model of parenting had resonated with a variety of people, and although

194
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,420
the punishment may strike some as harsh, there often wasn't a great level of discourse

195
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,420
on it.

196
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,680
The truth was that 8 Passengers harvested a strong view count with established sponsors

197
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,580
for a majority of their lifespan.

198
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:27,500
Um, 999,999, and then it jumped straight to a million and 5, and then 6, by the time

199
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,740
I got to look down it was like a million and 10, oh my gosh.

200
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,460
In spite of their success though, come 2020, the family channel heyday had mostly passed,

201
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,220
with a lot of 8 Passengers content only receiving a few hundred thousand views per video.

202
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,820
If anything, they'd survived the viral stage of their career, and were moving into a more

203
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,460
perhaps low-key era, where they would be able to focus on holding on to the law of

204
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,460
viewership and perhaps experimenting a little with content.

205
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,360
However, there are certainly limits to that experimentation, and although setting down

206
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,620
boundaries for what was enforced on and off camera, Ruby Franky was about to be a bit

207
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,340
too frank with her audience.

208
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,340
How would that happen?

209
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,340
Well.

210
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,100
There's an unpredictability about parenting, there are many ways that one can prepare to

211
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,100
raise a child, and help support them to be the best versions of themselves.

212
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,020
At the same time, there are always factors that one cannot control, be them outside the

213
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,940
parenting sphere, or be them within the child themselves.

214
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,620
Some people are not blessed with balanced chemicals within the brain, and that can cultivate

215
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,380
conflict during their development.

216
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,060
In the Franky family, this appeared to be the most conspicuous with their oldest son,

217
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,340
who although appearing rather mild-mannered throughout much of their content, was reported

218
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:48,580
by Ruby and Kevin to be experiencing some issues, which resulted in a suspension.

219
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,540
This incident appears to be alluded to in the earlier clip that I showed, where Ruby

220
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,260
stated that she felt this was not a discussion for the camera, however approximately half

221
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,500
a year after his suspension, Ruby's oldest son vanished from content on the channel altogether,

222
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,820
and although I doubt anyone assumed the worst, some people likely did ask some questions.

223
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,740
These questions would be answered at the end of 2019, where the Frankys go into more detail

224
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,660
surrounding their attempts to set their son on the right path, explaining over sentimental

225
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,340
acoustic music that they had decided to send him to a corrective course.

226
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:21,700
We debated whether we should talk to the viewers about what's been going on.

227
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:28,060
We wanted to do the right thing, so we got a lot of opinions from a lot of adults.

228
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,220
Who did this corrective course entail, exactly?

229
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,780
Well, it's our old friend, the Wilderness Camp, to be particular, the Anasazi Wilderness

230
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,300
Camp in Mesa, Arizona.

231
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:46,300
Today has just entered the Anasazi Foundation wilderness therapy program, where he's going

232
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:55,020
to spend the next eight to ten weeks living in the Anasazi desert, the desert mountains

233
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,020
of Arizona.

234
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,460
Now, I've already spoken in part about the concerns surrounding wilderness therapy in

235
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,940
my Dr Phil video, but generally I'm not an enthusiastic advocate for that form of treatment.

236
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,500
With that said, Anasazi is not Turnabout Ranch, and there are many issues related to Turnabout

237
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,500
Ranch that were independent from the concerns relating to wilderness therapy as a whole.

238
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,340
Although Kevin and Ruby are more revealing than they may usually be in this video, they

239
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,100
also still refrain from indulging details regarding their son's behaviour, stating that

240
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,260
it's been an ongoing issue outside the channel.

241
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:29,220
It's an accumulation of things over years, well before we ever started YouTubing, or

242
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:36,100
well before we ever got into social media, and it's reached a point where he needs to

243
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:42,180
develop some very basic maturity and skills that he's going to need as an adult.

244
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,700
One can't help but wonder whether if this was a problem before the issue channel, then

245
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,300
they should have been addressed before setting up a media account on a public platform, but

246
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,420
if that's how they decide to go about it, then so be it.

247
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,020
Although this upload likely drew skepticism from individuals who felt these camps were

248
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,940
detrimental, the Frankie's had already made up their mind, and despite hesitancy to talk

249
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,380
about it at first, over the coming months they continue to report on their son's progress

250
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,420
favourably, pulling some of the highest view counts of the year for their channel.

251
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,500
Their son returns home to a fanfare from his family, and in the coming months is heralded

252
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,780
as a resounding success.

253
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:25,700
It seems that wilderness therapy had worked this time, and Ruby's son was on his way

254
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,020
to becoming an upstanding citizen of society.

255
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,700
The next half year passed without a major family incident, they moved house, and formed

256
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,180
a united family front during the first cold months of the coronavirus pandemic, even chronicling

257
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,980
their response to the 2020 Salt Lake City earthquake.

258
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:43,140
It was safe to say there wasn't a scarcity in subjects and experiences to cover.

259
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,460
At the same time, having all the children home at once was obviously a great responsibility

260
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,460
on anyone, and many of those youngsters who were used to actually going outside on a regular

261
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:56,340
basis found the restrictions to cause a great restlessness, and restlessness can beget acting

262
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:00,740
out, and in one video at the end of May entitled What We Haven't Told You, Ruby reveals that

263
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,140
while herself and her husband were away at a retreat, the rules they set regarding allocated

264
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,020
use of technology had been breached by two family members.

265
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,940
She was obviously not thrilled by this information, and decided to be more vocal than usual on

266
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,780
the punishment that she deemed appropriate for these shenanigans, stating that electronic

267
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:19,060
items in the house would be banned for the coming summer, though this doesn't really

268
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,380
have to do with what they didn't tell us, does it?

269
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,700
Well, let's reintroduce her oldest son, who Ruby encourages to share his own personal

270
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,780
experience with the punitive measures imposed by his mother, which included the confiscation

271
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,620
of his electronic items as well.

272
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:36,420
Ruby- Every day I would wake up around 5am, and I would go and do my daily thinking in

273
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:42,340
front of that safe full of all my electronics, like the Xbox, and the iPads, and all the

274
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:49,700
iPhones, and the laptops, and the TV remotes, you even locked up the TV remotes, because

275
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,380
you locked them up for the entire summer.

276
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,060
We assume that this refers back to his past behavioural issues, and although some would

277
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:58,820
deem it rather strict, some would still argue that many of these devices are not items they

278
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,740
were necessarily entitled to, he at least still had the opportunity to hang out with

279
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,580
his friends and socialise in other ways.

280
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,180
This was already more information than many viewers were privy to usually, but the video

281
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:12,500
then takes a stranger turn with Ruby herself as the parent asking her son if he thinks

282
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,340
that she should confiscate the TV.

283
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,660
He responds saying that he was under the impression that she was doing so already, with Ruby's

284
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,460
response to be accusing him of quote, telling stories.

285
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,620
Ruby- You think you're reading my mind, and I'm-

286
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,540
Ruby- That's a story?

287
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,460
Storytelling?

288
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,380
Okay, fine, then take away TV from me.

289
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,820
Is that what you would suggest?

290
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,780
Sure, unless it's like a family movie, because I see him all the time watching Netflix.

291
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:42,260
Her son eventually concedes and says that he thinks it's a good idea, and although I'm

292
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:47,140
in favour of more democracy, it seems a very intriguing time to shirk one's parental responsibility.

293
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,900
We then cut to her divulging more information about how she confiscated her daughter's

294
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,340
phone, and what those punishments represented to her as a parent.

295
00:18:54,340 --> 00:19:00,580
So, in our house, we, when we take something away, it's because they have shown that they

296
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,540
are not responsible enough to manage it.

297
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,220
Although none of her diatribe felt completely unfathomable, her narratives were beginning

298
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,700
to feel a little defensive and unnecessary, with strange rules that I'm not even sure

299
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,860
anyone knew existed until this video.

300
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:19,140
It has to be consistent over a minimum, minimum of six months, and that-

301
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:24,740
One of the consequences is she will not be getting her nails painted for a solid month.

302
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,820
It was clear that this conversation was moving into new territory, but few could have been

303
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,460
prepared for the bombshell that was about to be dropped.

304
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,780
I don't think our viewers know that.

305
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,140
Not even Ruby.

306
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,900
Up to this point, you could easily question Ruby's disciplinary decisions,

307
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,580
but there was no catalyst for the sort of public attention that such methods could draw.

308
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,340
However, when discussing this six-month rule, her oldest son reveals that he had been without

309
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,420
a bed for a full seven months.

310
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:03,300
My bedroom was taken away for seven months, and then you give it back like a couple weeks ago.

311
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,660
I've been sleeping on a beanbag.

312
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:09,540
I've been sleeping on a beanbag since October, and they gave me my broom back like two weeks ago.

313
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,740
What was the reason for this?

314
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,220
That I woke up at two in the morning and told him that we're going to Disneyland and he

315
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,620
has to pack, and he got up and made his bed all neatly and then packed all his clothes

316
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,700
in the suitcase, and then he walked out the door and he's like, why?

317
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,740
And he's all happy, has his sunglasses on, and I was like, we're not going to Disneyland.

318
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,860
Well, it appears that the oldest son played a prank on his younger brother,

319
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,780
waking up at an ungodly hour and telling him that they were going to Disneyland, when in fact,

320
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,580
they were not.

321
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:40,740
This inevitably led to a lot of disappointment, and does seem like a rather cruel joke.

322
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,660
Ruby clarifies, though, that this was not the only issue, more so a final straw as he admits

323
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,980
he had been tormenting his sibling in other ways as well,

324
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,460
including on the day that he came back from wilderness therapy.

325
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:54,260
Ruby- When he began at his face and hung him on the basketball.

326
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,060
Ruby- Basically, basically...

327
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,300
Ruby- The day I got home, too.

328
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,020
However, although you could argue that demonstrated a potential issue in sharing a bedroom with a

329
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:12,340
sibling, few could see how forcing the son to sleep on a beanbag for seven months was a

330
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,900
just and proportionate punishment for such hijinks.

331
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,300
If you believe that two people can't share a bedroom between them,

332
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,540
then you need to take adequate measures to ensure that each party at least has a bed available.

333
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,500
Ruby's point isn't aided when it's revealed that since moving house,

334
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,580
they've actually had a whole bedroom available,

335
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,420
they just didn't allow their son to move into it due to the past incidents.

336
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:34,180
Outside of these details, Ruby's own response was somewhat indicative as well,

337
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,940
forcing out a nervous chuckle while observing that this was new information to the audience.

338
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,980
It would be easy to cut the recording here and edit out this discussion,

339
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,900
like I'm sure she had many times before.

340
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,900
But after her son had explained the predicament,

341
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,540
she decides that actually there was a point to be made.

342
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,980
What would her explanation be?

343
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:54,900
Ruby- Showed that he was not able to manage himself sharing a bedroom with...

344
00:21:54,900 --> 00:22:01,380
Chad- So when we moved, um, the bigger room in the basement was automatically his,

345
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,500
and I didn't have a room.

346
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,620
Ruby- So a lot of you are like, hey, that's not fair because got the bigger,

347
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,260
the lesser bedroom and got the bigger bedroom.

348
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,100
Chad- The smaller bedroom.

349
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:17,780
Ruby- Got the big bedroom and got the smaller bedroom and the bigger bedroom also had a bathroom.

350
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,540
But what you guys didn't know was you didn't get any room.

351
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,380
Well, honestly, not really much.

352
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,700
Once again, it seems more like a problem of coexistence rather than a problem of having

353
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,380
a bedroom. In a way, sometimes giving people a private space would be more helpful than

354
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,420
depriving them of it.

355
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,180
Although it feels like none of those in the video feel the punishment was proportionate,

356
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:40,180
even spending a fair amount of time laughing about the incidents, they still accept it.

357
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:44,180
The video only becomes more depressing by the minute, with both the kids she was filming

358
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:47,460
with stating that they have no friends at all, so they can't even hang out with them

359
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,260
for the summer.

360
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:52,260
Although Ruby expresses some form of sympathy, she doesn't seem particularly motivated to

361
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:56,100
do much about it, more just thinking about how it's perceived by the viewers.

362
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:56,980
Ruby- You can play with friends.

363
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,420
Chad- No, like I don't have friends.

364
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,380
Ruby- I don't have friends either.

365
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,420
Chad- I literally like told my friends I'm not hanging out with them anymore.

366
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,300
Ruby- See, because they're-

367
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,220
Chad- They say some pretty messed up stuff.

368
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,100
Ruby- How do you feel about not having any friends?

369
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:15,540
Chad- Sucks, but I don't feel safe or accepted in any friend group, so.

370
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:20,980
Ruby- That's really vulnerable of you to say that on camera, because you don't have to

371
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,700
film that.

372
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,860
No Ruby, you do not have to film that.

373
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,260
And yet, you did.

374
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,100
Still amongst this all, Ruby takes the time to make sure everyone knows how hard it's

375
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,780
been on her, though I'm not sure her son was completely buying it.

376
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:39,860
Look, when you make these choices with your family to take things away as a parent, you

377
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:45,300
really do want them to have these things, and it's been so, so, so difficult to take

378
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:50,900
a phone away, to take a bedroom away, to take iPads away, to take access away.

379
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:56,180
Like, it hurts me just as much as it hurts my kids.

380
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:00,020
Although the video finishes on a somewhat lighter note with Ruby finding some middle

381
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:03,700
ground with her younger son, people had already seen enough and began to call her out for

382
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,020
depriving her son of a bedroom and a bed.

383
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:10,260
This began on social media, with some using the clip and letting Ruby and Kevin know that

384
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,540
they were not happy, that Frankie seemed to be aware of this negative response because

385
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,340
the video was deleted within the first couple days following upload.

386
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:20,500
However, as people began to re-upload it and comments were able to be left below, it became

387
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:25,220
clear how many were not simply going to let this slide, with content creators soon providing

388
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,580
their input as well.

389
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:33,060
The video is titled, What We Haven't Told You, and in this video, her eldest son details

390
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:39,780
that he has not been sleeping in a bed, let alone a bedroom, in the past seven months.

391
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:44,500
But I just feel like as a punishment for pranking his brother should have just been like him

392
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:49,700
hanging out with his brother more, but, you know, this is an extreme form of parenting

393
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,100
here.

394
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,500
When a clip like this goes viral, many look towards the rest of a creator's body of content

395
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,420
to see if there were any other incidents that could signify a clear pattern of behaviour,

396
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,580
and like clockwork they did, with many netizens unearthing older video excerpts where they

397
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,900
felt she had gone too far in her parental approach.

398
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,820
Outside of publishing very revealing details and moments that many felt breached their

399
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,900
individual privacy, clips of her disciplinary measures included threatening to forfeit her

400
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,740
son's dinners if they continued play fighting, even though it was quite apparent it was in

401
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,900
jest, refusing to supply her six-year-old daughter with any additional sustenance after

402
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,660
she forgot to make herself lunch, threatening to behead her daughter's fluffy toy as she

403
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:28,580
continued to act out with these scissors, and this one where she's in her best Miranda

404
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,460
Sings cosplay.

405
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:43,540
Those few clips in particular picked up traction because they just seemed unnecessarily harsh

406
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,980
without any real motive.

407
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:49,620
People forget things, people muck around, especially when they're young, Ruby was and

408
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,980
is no exception, and to preach that a six-year-old needs to go hungry or else she won't learn

409
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,900
to make her own lunch is just an unreasonably cynical perspective, especially given that

410
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,540
as far as we know it was the first time that this had occurred.

411
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:03,460
When you put all of the incriminating clips together, they create a pretty damning portrait

412
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,380
of the sort of household that Ruby Franky was operating, and many felt at that point

413
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,380
she was already unfit to be a parent, with an individual launching a change.org petition

414
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:15,780
to have CPS investigate the parents, and to ensure the safety of all those involved.

415
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,580
This was escalating very quickly, with many clips painting the parents in a very unflattering

416
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,420
light, however there were always two sides to the story, and the Frankys were gearing

417
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,540
up to present their own.

418
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,540
What would they say?

419
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:32,340
Ruby Franky-"I'm going to do a video and post it tomorrow, but I think I'm just gonna do it right now."

420
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:43,700
As noted, in spite of their content not exactly inviting people to make their voices heard,

421
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,940
the Frankys were extremely sensitive to audience response, and removed their upload nearly as soon

422
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,260
as they began to sense negative feedback, very shortly after Ruby took to Instagram Stories

423
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,260
to address the criticism directed at her.

424
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:59,300
Ruby Franky-"I'm going to, um, I'm gonna post tomorrow. I don't normally post on Saturdays,

425
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:06,820
and I would love to validate all of your anger, and to let you know that I hear you,

426
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,900
and I understand why you're upset."

427
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:15,060
The first clip onto her Instagram acknowledges the feedback, and commits to responding the

428
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:19,060
following day. It's slightly hard to interpret how she feels about it, although she is vocal

429
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:23,220
in stating that the people expressing their concern are heard. Her tone is marked by an

430
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,060
undercurrent of disdain, particularly when referencing people who have sent her messages,

431
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,900
many of which she claims are supportive.

432
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:33,860
Ruby Franky-"It's always so interesting when things go black and white.

433
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:38,100
Not everything goes black and white, but every once in a while there's a post where

434
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:45,620
you either really hate what you've heard, and that's usually what fills up in the comments,

435
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:51,140
and then it's in the DMs where people don't want to be attacked for giving support,

436
00:27:51,140 --> 00:28:00,260
which I totally get, but I've gotten a lot of support in the DMs, so for that, I thank you."

437
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,660
However, six hours later, with the situation clearly ballooning online, Ruby changed her

438
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:08,820
mind and decides to tackle it once more on her Instagram story, appearing in the car with her

439
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,900
husband Kevin, for a ten minute statement which explains the rationale behind her controversial

440
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:19,220
upload. Ruby Franky-"I didn't anticipate all the upset, however, listening to all of your comments

441
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:26,820
and your feedback and your feelings around things, it totally makes sense to me why you're

442
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:31,460
angry and why you're upset." She explains that she was surprised that the son has spoken about all

443
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,780
the quote outcomes of his behaviour, and had repeatedly reassured him that she was happy to

444
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:40,340
cut it from the upload, an offer which her son declined, stating that this should be uploaded.

445
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:44,180
However, in hindsight, she can see why the content was upsetting for certain viewers.

446
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,620
This is where Kevin chimes in, expressing sympathy towards the viewer's perspective,

447
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,900
but also going into detail about their son's background, and why they felt,

448
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:55,220
after consultation with professionals, the sanction imposed on their son was justified.

449
00:28:55,220 --> 00:29:00,260
Kevin-"Long before we started YouTube, there were a lot of behavioural and emotional challenges that

450
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:05,540
we were dealing with with our kids, and we've been consulting with mental health and emotional

451
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:12,420
health professionals for years. And the things that we show and share, and the things that

452
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:18,500
many of you are criticizing and calling abusive, are actually things that mental health professionals

453
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:24,100
have counseled us to do." There are pudiate claims that this sort of treatment could ever be labelled

454
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,540
as abuse, with Ruby stating that although she would agree that parents who deprived their

455
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,860
children of beds could be classified as such, she hasn't done this for fun, from her perspective,

456
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,140
this was a warranted forfeiture, and that was something that had also been enforced at the

457
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:39,300
Anasazi camp. This was all in line with her parenting style, and she wasn't fazed by the

458
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:43,700
accusations as she'd experienced them before, and considers those accusing her this time as

459
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:49,540
uninformed as any of those prior detractors. Ruby-"We got accused of child abuse when we sent

460
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:58,180
to Anasazi. Guess what? The first thing that they did was take a bed away. They don't have beds,

461
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:05,300
so slept on the hard ground for months, and it's, you know, it's run by psychologists and therapists,

462
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:12,980
and if not having a bed was psychologically damaging, then they wouldn't have suggested that."

463
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:16,180
She states that the bottom line is this is how they parent. They receive a lot of comments

464
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:20,100
wondering how their children are so well behaved, and the results are there on the YouTube channel

465
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,180
for anyone to actually see. Kevin and Ruby then accuse many of those criticizing them for

466
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:29,140
projecting their own experiences onto them. Ruby-"And so if you are triggered, and you're upset

467
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:36,660
because of something Kevin and I have done with our children that is actually working really well

468
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:45,860
for us, then I would invite you to look at it and ask yourself what is it that I'm projecting

469
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:51,700
onto this situation, because you would be upset, and you would be angry if I was your mom doing

470
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:56,420
this to you." The next five minutes are a mix of dollar store psychoanalysis of those attacking

471
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,860
them, and a variety of further disorganized thoughts on the matter. I don't really have

472
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:03,540
too much to add here, it should be clear by now that their line of response was to acknowledge

473
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:07,140
those who may be concerned, and attempt to show that they were listening, but also dismiss

474
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,900
accusations implying that people were not adequately informed or familiar with the relevant

475
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,820
context to actually appreciate these methods of parenting. This response was not received well,

476
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,420
with many feeling that the Frankies were trying to shift the responsibility of interpreting the

477
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:22,900
situation onto anyone but themselves. Paired with the unravelling allegations regarding other clips

478
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,420
they had posted on their channel, they decided to continue uploading content while ignoring

479
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:30,180
the criticism. One of their next uploads though was announcing their son's new room,

480
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,940
this was to be expected as they had done this before for other siblings, but it wasn't really

481
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:37,300
a good time to post this, and although people couldn't voice their thoughts as the comments

482
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:41,060
were turned off, the like to dislike ratio reflected a still present eye towards the

483
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:45,620
embattled family channel. However, in spite of the criticism, no platform seemed inclined to act in

484
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:49,460
the moment, the petition ultimately went nowhere, and although it was reported they had received a

485
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:53,940
visit from CPS, this case was also closed pretty quickly. In the weeks after granting their son a

486
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:58,660
new bedroom, and with the storm clouds on their way out, the Frankies began to fight back finally,

487
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:02,740
firstly issuing cease and desist letters to many YouTubers who had in their opinion posted

488
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:07,460
defamatory content. Further this, they issued one more response to the media website, Insider,

489
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:12,420
though not entirely unopposed, the title framing these YouTubers as speaking out is certainly an

490
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:17,060
interesting choice. The article briefly recapped the situation before going over the perspective

491
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,380
of how many felt this punishment was harsh, and even drafting in multiple psychological experts

492
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:26,180
to explain how harsh punishments affect the mental development of youngsters, even having one explain

493
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:30,420
why seizing a bed would be extremely upsetting, seemingly setting up some quite strong criticism

494
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:34,980
of the Frankies. They respond however by stating that they actually never chose to forfeit their

495
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:39,220
son a bed, they gave him a choice on the matter, and that he was offered a guest bed and an

496
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:43,620
inflatable mattress as well, they were just separating the siblings as recommended by their

497
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:47,460
own psychologists. Ruby insists that they are teaching their children to be self-governing,

498
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:51,620
and that their son chose the bean bag because it was the most comfortable to him, and in spite of

499
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:55,780
her previously stated six-month rule, her son could have actually had the new bedroom at any

500
00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:00,340
point his behaviour changed, it just happened to take seven months for him to make that choice.

501
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:06,180
And so we don't just turn around and give it back as soon as they start acting good.

502
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,620
It has to be consistent.

503
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:14,820
It has to be consistent over a minimum of six months, and that's showing up consistent in

504
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,820
every aspect of their life.

505
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:20,820
This response doesn't appear any more honest than the others, as a matter of fact there are many

506
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:25,220
details that don't seem to add up at all or line up to her previous narratives, even ones spoken

507
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:29,540
about in previous videos. The Frankies conclude by stating that the story is his to tell if he

508
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:34,180
chooses to, and with that they draw a line under the situation and all points of view surrounding

509
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,300
it. They say that they are proud of how their kids have handled it, and there are passionate

510
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,220
defences of their parents, including their daughter who posted on her Instagram in a message

511
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,900
which doesn't sound remotely like anything her elders would say, and the son in a wonderful

512
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:49,140
place right now, with a good group of friends and a healthy outlook on life where he holds high

513
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:54,180
standards and high boundaries. It seems that this challenge had only made their bond as a family

514
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:58,980
stronger, there was nothing that these malicious online trolls could say which could ever hold them

515
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,500
back, was there?

516
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:12,420
In the insider interview, the Frankies also provide their input on one more clip, the one where

517
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,620
Ruby refuses to give her daughter lunch after she had forgotten it.

518
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:21,220
Ruby- And hopefully, hopefully nobody gives her food and nobody steps in and gives her a lunch.

519
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:25,860
Once again they state there is missing context, and in fact Ruby had a lot of sympathy, but ultimately

520
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:30,980
they were so near the end of the day and that it was a one and a half hour round trip etc etc etc,

521
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:35,860
and maybe there is the distant possibility that this is true, but it's just not how it came across.

522
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:41,460
Ruby- She was responsible for making her lunches in the morning and she actually told me she did

523
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:46,180
pack a lunch, so the natural outcome is she's just going to need to be hungry,

524
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:53,540
and hopefully, hopefully nobody gives her food and nobody steps in and gives her a lunch.

525
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:57,300
There almost certainly is missing context because it's a clip from a YouTube video,

526
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,380
but this additional context provided by the parents doesn't really undermine the simple

527
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:06,100
observation that you sat in the car and chose to say that you hope nobody gives her food to

528
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,780
teach her a lesson. The Frankies' responses in the article appear to attempt to present their

529
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:13,380
parental style in a different light than their own content does, and given that they're the

530
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:17,140
ones who choose to upload those videos in the first place, it wasn't particularly convincing

531
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:21,620
as backtracking goes. If any of the people who advocate over this style of parenting read these

532
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:26,340
articles, they probably would have found it weak, and many of her critics were still not convinced.

533
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:31,220
On one hand, by the end of June 2020, the outrage over their parental conduct had mostly passed,

534
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,900
and a large majority of the Frankies' critics were not necessarily followers of the Eight

535
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:39,060
Passengers YouTube channel, so their investment or lack of shouldn't have influenced the ability

536
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:43,380
to upload successful content. Nevertheless, the family responses hadn't really instilled

537
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,380
confidence in viewers either. For people who had casually viewed her content and not necessarily

538
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:51,700
noticed these parental strategies until they were pointed out, Ruby and Kevin's responses weren't

539
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,700
convincing. The simple fact was that whether a psychologist recommended that her two sons

540
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,940
be separated doesn't negate the information they still actively chose to leave an available

541
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:04,900
bedroom empty after moving house, something that I do wonder how psychologists would feel about.

542
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:08,420
However, if you were a fan of the Eight Passengers YouTube channel and actually found their parental

543
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:12,420
style to be appealing to you, you probably don't like their moving the goalposts either,

544
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,100
because it seems to imply that they've actually been leaving information out of their videos

545
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:19,700
to make their parental style look stricter than it is, which for a YouTube channel that

546
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,940
occasionally presents themselves as an authority on parenting is a betrayal of sorts.

547
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:30,820
Austin! What are you... What are you... What's going through your head?

548
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,060
Oh my god!

549
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,940
A lot of family channels on YouTube managed to maintain an audience despite being pretty awful

550
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:50,820
because they don't necessarily set up the pretense that they possess any actual wisdom on parenting.

551
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:54,580
As I said at the start, people watch them for entertainment, and therefore when they publish

552
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:59,060
controversial or provocative content, their core viewership isn't necessarily switched off by it,

553
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:03,620
even if others do call them out. With the Eight Passengers channel, Ruby always attempted to find

554
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:07,540
some form of moral foundation to underpin the content with, to turn around and say,

555
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:11,780
well that isn't the entire story, even if it's in the form of defending yourself is going to

556
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,940
disillusion at least some of those who had formerly found value in what you created. The truth was

557
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:20,260
that although the anger from external sources had mostly passed, there was a degree of distrust that

558
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:24,740
lingered amongst viewership. When the situation initially broke, Eight Passengers lost a fair few

559
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:28,820
subscribers, and if they successfully vindicated themselves amongst those viewers, they would have

560
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:33,060
returned. A check of Social Blade would tell you that that did not happen, as a matter of fact,

561
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:37,940
quite the opposite. I can't believe this is how freeze-dried gummy bears look. I feel like I did

562
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:44,260
something wrong. Look at this, those are really good. Those are really good. Eight Passengers

563
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:48,980
continued to upload over the remainder of 2020, and for the extent of 2021 as well. Not too much

564
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:53,140
was said about them online, and going over their content in this time, it was noticeably milder,

565
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:57,620
with nearly a complete avoidance of confrontation altogether. It was very apparent that their brush

566
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:01,300
with their critics had steered them completely clear of addressing disciplinary issues in their

567
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:06,180
family, and they wanted to rebuild their image, although they were integrating some more curious

568
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:11,700
language. I don't know how to write a book, and then when I wrote the book, I learned new things,

569
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,540
and I went back and I saw all of the distortion that was in my first book, and I thought,

570
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:19,220
this can't be right. Interesting way to use the word distortion, but

571
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:24,100
I digress. Obviously, people still felt the way they did, but even amongst declining viewership,

572
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:28,020
the words of what they said at the end of the Insider article still rang true. What mattered

573
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:32,260
is that they were a healthy, happy family first, and although they had been shaken by the drama,

574
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:36,420
they must have seen the bright side of it, right? Well, there was one more article published in the

575
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,940
aftermath of their run-in with the internet. Published by The Ramp, this think piece once

576
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:43,700
more reflects where the Ruby and Kevin's own punishment was justified for how they were

577
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,860
portrayed. I don't really care too much for what The Ramp says in this article, but it certainly

578
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:52,100
provides an interesting insight into where the Frankie's were now. Over a year on, still

579
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:56,020
ruined the legacy of a situation that lasted a couple weeks, talking about the mob and the

580
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:00,260
sponsors they lost due to it. There's a real element of despondency in the tone of the Frankie's

581
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:04,020
throughout the article, they have not moved on. Despite being a channel with approximately 1

582
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:08,500
billion views from content, an extensive catalogue that many people frequently return to, despite

583
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:13,380
surviving the slew of criticism and still scoring at least 100,000 views a day on most days,

584
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,940
it was not enough. As a family channel, what you're providing is, in essence, a slice of life

585
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:22,020
content, you're documenting things that in many households would occur naturally. This doesn't

586
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:26,180
mean that YouTube is any less of a job for those people, but there's a purported sincerity that

587
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:30,820
this is what you love, and you would still do it the same way even if the cameras were off.

588
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,980
Ruby's husband, Kevin, still had a well-paying job as far as we knew, the YouTube channel was

589
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:38,900
a wonderful bonus, and in videos, Ruby didn't present it any other way.

590
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:45,220
Cooking in the kitchen when my kids were little was not very fun. I hated it because it was always

591
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:49,700
messier and it took longer than it really needed to, but what we really like to do now is cook

592
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:56,500
together, we're constantly making food together. I think we pretty much live in this room constantly.

593
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,940
I'm going to be blunt here, but there was something about how they speak in this interview

594
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,940
which provides the impression that they care more about the content than they do their own family.

595
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:07,540
The fact of the matter is that both sides had the chance to present their perspectives,

596
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:11,460
and as Ruby and Kevin noted themselves, most of these critics were not frequent viewers of

597
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:15,220
the channel. Unfortunately, their response wasn't convincing enough for some who were,

598
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:19,140
and they couldn't recoup that, and in spite of the fact that they still actually retained a lot,

599
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:23,460
they felt more comfortable lamenting what they could've had, rather than what was in front of

600
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:34,660
them. They still had their family, right? Well. There's often justified reason to question the

601
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,580
authenticity of YouTube couples. When you build a life around that, there's a pressure that you

602
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:42,420
must stay together for your image, for their perception of you. When that becomes intertwined

603
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,940
with your business, it can cause a lot of complications. I'd say the same could be said

604
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:50,100
about family channels. By this point, it was apparent that people weren't receiving the full

605
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:54,180
picture of what was truly going on inside the Frankie household. Although they had since mostly

606
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:58,340
avoided discussing discipline on their channel, they still defended their actions when asked,

607
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:02,820
which to many would imply that this reality they were creating for the camera was more manufactured

608
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:06,740
than ever. Their statements to the rap reinforced this, if you're not happy with the channel where

609
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:11,380
you post your life, the memories of you and your family, then how can you truly be happy with that

610
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:16,340
life either? And at the start of 2022, the 8 Passengers YouTube channel posted its last video

611
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:20,820
before falling inactive. Maybe they'd finally realised how detrimental this environment was

612
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:25,140
to those they loved, and took steps to remove themselves from that so they could heal properly,

613
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:29,540
or maybe they were just investing their energy into something else. So with that in mind,

614
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,820
let's introduce a supporting character to this lovely tale.

615
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:39,620
If you're like me, you've had pain in your life. It could be from a divorce, work conflicts,

616
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:46,820
relationship issues with children, grandchildren, spouse anxiety, depression, or fear that you don't

617
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:52,820
understand, feelings that you're not enough, or that you're unlovable. Connections is the solution.

618
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:57,940
This is Jodie Hildebrandt. She is a founder of self-help company Connections. With over two decades

619
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:01,700
experience in the psychotherapy world, at a passing glance she may not strike you as anyone

620
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:06,340
out of the ordinary. However, her background does deviate a little from that of the usual therapist.

621
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:10,740
She completed a graduate work in educational psychology, and registered as a licensed counselor

622
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:14,900
in Utah with Cirque Lodge, a rehabilitation clinic for people struggling with addiction.

623
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:18,660
However, she left the profession not too long after joining, expressing dissolution of the

624
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:23,620
welfare of her patients. In her own words, they were not healing. So she decided to set up her

625
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:28,580
own organization, with a goal to empower people, helping patients harness the truth, and avoiding

626
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:33,060
the treacherous distortions that manifest themselves in our lives. This assistance takes

627
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:37,860
the form of paid courses that you can access online or in person. Although in many ways it

628
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:41,540
doesn't appear the most threatening, there is certainly a language choice that would strike

629
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:46,820
readers as somewhat cultish, and further reading wouldn't inspire too much hope either. Hildebrandt

630
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:51,700
herself had been subject to a period of probation in 2012 after breaching patient confidentiality

631
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:56,820
multiple times by revealing information about her patients to other counselors, church clergy,

632
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:01,780
and even a local university, all of which without their consent. Although she successfully regained

633
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:06,340
her license and resumed her practice, when you pair it with her present-day ventures, you wouldn't be

634
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:11,300
wrong to exercise some caution. Nevertheless, that didn't stop people from signing up.

635
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:17,220
A couple of those people being Kevin and Ruby Frankie. Kevin- And some of these parenting-isms, these

636
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:24,180
cultural-isms that have contaminated parenting are things like beliefs that, it's my job to make

637
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:29,060
my kids happy. Hildebrandt- Give them a magical childhood. Kevin- It's my job to give my child

638
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:36,900
a magical childhood. It's my job to make my children smile and laugh. It's my job to make

639
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:45,140
my children successful. It's my job to prevent my children from having pain, right? All of these,

640
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:50,260
they all come from the same place, and it all comes from this belief, this distorted belief,

641
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:58,340
that I can measure my worth as an individual by how I parent. The Frankie family's first public

642
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:02,260
association with connections came via announcement on their Instagram page, where they were proclaimed

643
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,860
as panel members at an upcoming couples conference. However, one can assume that they were

644
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:09,220
likely involved in the business before then, especially given that they had previously

645
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:13,140
traveled to Europe with Paige Hanna, another creator who was previously affiliated with the

646
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:17,460
business. They appeared to have started counseling towards the end of 2020 due to videos posted on

647
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:21,460
connections' Facebook accounts. In spite of this, it seems that the controversy is what pushed them

648
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:25,380
to be more vocally involved, possibly seeking reinforcement for their own beliefs, and in the

649
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:29,460
coming couple years they were featured more and more promptly on the website and accompanying

650
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:33,540
social media, with a favor even being returned on the 8 Passengers YouTube channel. Hildebrandt- One

651
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:38,740
resource that I really like for mental health is connectionsclassroom.com. I will have the

652
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:43,060
connections classroom website down in the description box below, and you can also follow

653
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:47,940
them on Instagram over at connections coaching. Ruby in particular seemed to be devoting significant

654
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:52,180
portions of her personal time to associating with connections, and with the YouTube channel firmly

655
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:56,740
in the rearview mirror, she began to take this venture rather seriously, if not a little too

656
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:01,540
seriously. The first casualty of her new commitment was the 8 Passengers Instagram account. In the past,

657
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:05,700
this had been a supplement to the YouTube channel, where she had shared many of her fondest memories,

658
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:10,820
but on the 28th of June a new post was uploaded, a series of images overloaded with circles,

659
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:15,380
underlining, and various words capitalized, alongside a text post rambling about what the

660
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:20,180
principles are. Next to a litany of hashtags at the bottom were the messages of honesty,

661
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:25,140
responsibility, and humility, words we'd seen before, but this time it was Ruby Frankie who

662
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:30,020
was promulgating them. Around this time the 8 Passengers Instagram account rebranded to

663
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:34,820
Moms of Truth, with it becoming an account dedicated to Jodie and Ruby's thoughts

664
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:38,420
and teachings. It was almost somewhat scary how disposable all the previous

665
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:41,940
family content was to her, but she had clearly found a new calling.

666
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:51,220
Truth is love. Truth creates. Truth gives inspiration. Distortion deceives. Distortion

667
00:45:51,220 --> 00:46:00,340
destroys. Distortion attacks. Distortion looks for proof. Distortion points the finger. Distortion

668
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:04,820
blames. In the following months, the post did not let up, with Ruby using this platform to promote

669
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:08,980
various pieces of doctrine. Although it received positive feedback from supporters, many followers

670
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:13,140
of the previous 8 Passengers Instagram account seemed confused, and even concerned about the

671
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:17,380
language she was using in these video posts, utilizing anecdotes and analogies to speak

672
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:22,900
very cryptically about parenting. Truth is not aggressive. Truth stands alone. Truth doesn't

673
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:29,140
need to be proved. Truth just is. It's like the sun, the sun doesn't have to get allies to come

674
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:35,220
around it and give it validation that it exists. It just exists. It doesn't need anybody to point

675
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:39,700
it out. It's just there. It seems, though, that this wasn't just having a negative effect on her

676
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:44,500
public presence. Towards the end of Summer 2022, rumours began to circulate that Ruby was no longer

677
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:48,580
living with her husband Kevin, and that although there was no official divorce, there wasn't any

678
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:52,660
apparent intent to re-establish contact. Word was that further this, it was reported that their

679
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:57,140
oldest son had also moved out of the family house, possibly staying with their father. It also began

680
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:00,660
to spread that Ruby's oldest daughter was no longer in contact with the family either, and

681
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:04,580
towards the end of September, she took to Instagram to respond to these rumours, stating that although

682
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:08,180
it was true that she was no longer in contact with those formerly close to her, and that she had

683
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:11,940
denounced the teachings and connections, many of the rumours were also unhelpful, and that she

684
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:16,100
would appreciate some privacy on the matter going forward. With the 8 Passengers YouTube channel

685
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:19,700
being brought to an end, you wouldn't be amiss to think that it could have provided an opportunity

686
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:24,100
to finally cut away from the superficiality that such a platform constrains YouTube, and back to

687
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:29,140
being that devoted parent. The cessation of uploads meant that Ruby no longer had a commitment to the

688
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:33,780
image she portrayed on said YouTube channel. However, it seems that image was actually more

689
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:38,100
charitable than reality, and now that she was unshackled, she was falling into a dangerous

690
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:42,820
spiral towards a fanatical belief system that sought to justify her parenting. If Ruby's

691
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:46,580
social media has told us anything, it was never about her family.

692
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:53,300
Intro

693
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,660
The problem when you're being pulled into an organisation like the one Jodie Hildebrandt

694
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:00,980
was operating is that you often don't realise that it's happening. Even if Ruby Franky was

695
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:04,660
never someone you wanted to run into, prior to the renovation of her Instagram account,

696
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:08,580
she still possessed some characteristics that could be identified with her. In these videos,

697
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:12,740
though, her only real personality was spreading the message of connections and applying it to

698
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:16,660
her own life. It should have been clear that this was a person deeply unwell. Nevertheless,

699
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:20,900
although many had now vocally expressed their concern, even likely many of those close to Ruby,

700
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:25,220
one of the scariest factors of cult mentality is that explicative dissonance, that you can just

701
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:29,220
dismiss someone by stating they're too ignorant to understand, and I have no doubt that's why

702
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:33,940
the Franky mother continued down this path without any outward trepidation or apprehension.

703
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:37,380
Her language was filled with a plethora of buzzwords that wouldn't really make sense in

704
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:41,300
regular conversation, but obviously held meaning within connections, and although most of the

705
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:45,860
online crowd rejected these doctrines, one person continued to reward Ruby's loyalty.

706
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:51,220
Jodie, who towards the end of 2022 invited Ruby onto her connections podcast and YouTube channel,

707
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:55,380
and appointed her to the business team and acclaimed her as a certified mental fitness

708
00:48:55,380 --> 00:49:00,420
trainer. Certified by who? Well, we don't know, but I'm sure it only further emboldened Ruby's

709
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:04,980
image of herself as a missionary for this message in her mind. Perhaps this made little sense given

710
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:09,060
Ruby's staunchly religious upbringing, but although there were mentions of God and Christianity

711
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:13,620
in Connections writings, it mostly seems like a pseudo-scientific approach to supporting certain

712
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:17,940
conservative religious values. It seems that everyone who was in proximity of Ruby was

713
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:21,700
escaping as quickly as they could, but what about the people who couldn't?

714
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:27,860
If your kid came to you on fire, would you say, I'm so glad you trusted me to tell me you're on

715
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:32,020
fire, that if I put out the fire that's gonna really hurt and you're gonna end up with scabs

716
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:37,860
anyway, so I'm just gonna love you where you are right now? No! You throw them on the ground and

717
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:42,980
you start rolling them, you get a blanket and you start hitting the flames, and they're gonna say,

718
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:48,260
you're hurting me, you're beating me, you're controlling us, like, no dear, hold still,

719
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:53,700
I'm getting the fire out. That's what a loving parent does, because nobody will do it, it looks

720
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:58,260
to the world crazy. Her Moms of Truth account, although being a rather transparent advocacy

721
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:02,660
platform for the Connections way of life, also revolved around topics of parenting, hence the

722
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:07,460
Moms part of the account name. By now, people already had an idea of her parental methods,

723
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:11,620
but with more of these videos in the posts, it began to dawn on people that Ruby's opinions

724
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:17,220
were becoming even more extreme and aberrant. Ruby- What in the world? Yes, yes, sleepovers

725
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:21,300
are distorted. She wouldn't let her children sleep over at a friend's house, she doesn't like laid

726
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:26,020
back children or angry people, she and Jodie just get really annoyed at a meme for some reason,

727
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:31,220
and you also shouldn't be doing your nails out of insecurity, I guess. Ruby- I'm going to go out and

728
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:36,820
do my nails per se, there's nothing inherently inappropriate or distorted about doing your nails,

729
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:46,580
however, if I go and do my nails because I'm feeling ugly or I'm wanting to have some social

730
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:51,780
activity with somebody and I don't have any of my friends around and so I want to go engage with

731
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:56,820
the people at the nail salon because I want to distract myself because my life is not comfortable,

732
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:03,540
then those would be motives that would not be responsible. Ultimately though, I think what is

733
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:07,300
most concerning is the sort of morals that underscore this content, particularly from a

734
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:11,940
parenting perspective. Really, living in truth is just connections jargon for having an extreme

735
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:16,180
level of control in one's life. Everything you do is a choice, from every action to the expression

736
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:20,740
of every emotion, and you're more than what you feel, etc. It's not an inherently dangerous point

737
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:24,500
of view when presented under that image, and it's never a bad idea to try and encourage people

738
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:28,100
towards a state where they can channel their feelings more productively. At the same time,

739
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:32,340
this is a dangerous manifestation of it, and it promotes the ideal person through a very

740
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:37,140
homogenous lens, which is why Ruby and Jodie waste no time getting to micromanaging the motives

741
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:41,780
behind doing your nails. Those sorts of behaviours must be stamped out, and that's a particularly

742
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:45,060
detrimental point of view for one demographic, children.

743
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:50,900
Ruby- You, the mom, are not responsible to make school fun and entertaining.

744
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,180
Jodie- Whaaaat? Ruby- Yeah, you're not.

745
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:59,860
Guess what, if your child finds homeschool boring, that's because he chose to be bored.

746
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:06,820
That's because she chose to have a perception of needing to be entertained. It's a form of entitlement.

747
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:10,100
I don't need to explain the psychology behind why younger people may struggle

748
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:13,300
over controlling their emotions and their actions more than older people.

749
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:17,380
Misbehaviour is an inevitability, and what matters is that the lesson is learned.

750
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:21,460
The philosophy of connections, though, wants a mould, and a person to fit very tightly inside

751
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:25,380
that mould. Ruby Frankly was always a person who leaned towards more punitive parenting to

752
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:30,660
teach her children those messages, she saw as her duty to enact the consequences of those actions.

753
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:35,700
Yet with an ever narrowing view on what was even represented by good behaviour, her parenting style

754
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:40,100
was appearing more and more unhinged, with her continuing to promote these methods in her podcasts

755
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:44,740
and live videos, stating that she cared more about the pursuit of principles than her own children.

756
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:48,740
It would lead some to be quite concerned about the safety of a family in the care of this person

757
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:54,020
who seems to think that she has free reign to act as she wishes. After all, she is in truth,

758
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,980
and you are in distortion, something that she seemed to embrace when

759
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:01,140
emotionally reflecting on her decision to discontinue the 8 Passengers YouTube series.

760
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:07,300
You wonder why I left YouTube? It's to save my kids. No amount of money.

761
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:16,660
And I'm telling you, I was making millions, and I left it, because my kids were being

762
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:24,260
hurt with entitlement, they were being hurt with people's advice, and they didn't have a mother up

763
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:29,060
the front saying, I don't care what the world's opinion is, this is the truth, and this is where

764
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:33,700
I stand. And fortunately, I had a chance, I had them in my home long enough to do it,

765
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:38,340
and I'm not going to lose them. Normally, this would be a very good decision. I think most of

766
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:42,180
her critics agree that she should not have been sharing aspects of her family's life on the

767
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:46,260
YouTube channel, and it wouldn't be healthy for a marriage. But without any record on how she was

768
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:51,060
treating the children now, people are actually growing more concerned, especially how she spoke

769
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:55,300
about parenting in these clips. She seemed to not just be promoting traditional values,

770
00:53:55,300 --> 00:54:00,180
but obsessive, overbearing, and restrictive ideas with the expectation that her children

771
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:04,660
will just turn around and say thank you. They're trying to hold you hostage, saying you need to

772
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:09,540
give me privacy, you need to honor my boundaries, you need to honor my feelings, you don't care

773
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:18,500
about me, you're invading my space, those are my personal feelings. No. In this home, you don't get

774
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:24,260
personal space, because this is my space, because I'm the parent. If you want your own personal

775
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:30,260
space, you'll need to get your own space. This is mine. And as long as you're living in my home,

776
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:38,340
it is my job to know everything about you. In 2023, these concerns were not eased,

777
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:43,220
and more TikTok accounts and media outlets began to pick up on her downward spiral, even referring

778
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:47,940
to older clips which had come under scrutiny in the past, but Ruby persisted. She was also still

779
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:52,340
distant from her husband, with many wondering if divorce would be the final outcome, but Ruby

780
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:56,260
persisted. Her relationships with her family weren't appearing to improve either, and one of the

781
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:01,060
strongest slights of all, her oldest daughter celebrated her 20th birthday at her sister Bonnie's,

782
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:06,260
with them celebrating in a video that was uploaded to their YouTube channel, but Ruby persisted.

783
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:11,620
So, Jodi and I have each shared an example from our own lives of what real love looks like,

784
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:16,820
which isn't what the world thinks is love. They'd push back and say, whoa, that's mean,

785
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:22,820
you're not going to be loved, your children are going to kick you out of their lives. Anytime

786
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:27,940
that you make a decision, and in the back of your mind you have, well, I want them to take care of

787
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:33,620
me in my old age, that's not love. That's not love. There was no circumstance under which her style

788
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:36,980
of parenting could possibly be wrong, and although she may have been a neglectful,

789
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:41,860
selfish parent in the past, this time she was going to get it right, by being a part of every

790
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:46,660
one of her remaining children's lives. She had to show them the way of truth, and lead them out

791
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:53,140
of distortion, towards those principles of honesty, responsibility, and humility.

792
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:58,020
Police say this is the house a young child escaped from, and went to a neighbor's house,

793
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,020
asking for food and water.

794
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:01,080
Yeah.

795
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:12,260
Music

796
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:17,060
On August the 30th of 2023, the police were called to the household of a concerned civilian

797
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:21,700
in Ivins, Utah, to follow up on reports of a juvenile in need of help. This individual was

798
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:25,780
described as malnourished with duct tape on the extremities, a condition so severe that the

799
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:30,100
authorities decided they would require hospital treatment. The evidence led officers to a nearby

800
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:33,540
home where they found another youngster in a similar condition, and transported them to a

801
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:36,980
hospital as well, with the remaining children in place under the care of the Department of

802
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:40,820
Child and Family Services. Following further investigation into this incident, two arrests

803
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:44,180
were made, Jody Hildebrandt, and Ruby Franke.

804
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:55,780
Music

805
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:59,460
It seems that many people's concerns were more than justified, and that it may not have just

806
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:03,940
been as bad as some may have imagined, but worse. Over the coming days, more details would be

807
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:08,340
revealed as neighbors and family members expressed relief that action had finally been taken. Ruby's

808
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:12,180
oldest daughter was one of the first to post a statement to her Instagram, stating that herself

809
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:16,340
and her family had been trying to tell the police and CPS for years about this, and they were glad

810
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:20,660
that they had finally stepped in. Franke's sisters also posted a joint Instagram statement expressing

811
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:24,900
the necessity for Franke and Hildebrandt's detention. Ruby's oldest also requested help on

812
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:29,140
finding any incriminating clips that could help the legal case against the two detainees. This

813
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:33,060
would be elaborated on in future videos by Bonnie and Julie, both of which state that they had an

814
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:37,300
otherwise pretty strong family relationship until Jody and connections became involved,

815
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:41,700
and would eventually cause the rift between them and Ruby to open up. As sisters, they're obviously

816
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:45,540
going to be more sympathetic to a family member they've known for years, but they still don't

817
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:47,620
defend or justify her actions.

818
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:52,260
Jody Hildebrandt-"We all felt weird about this Jody lady, we weren't comfortable with it,

819
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:56,100
we didn't like it, we didn't like the teachings Ruby was bringing to the family functions,

820
00:57:56,100 --> 00:58:00,500
and we were this close to telling her if you come to our family events anymore,

821
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:04,500
we do not want to hear what you were learning through connections because we don't like it.

822
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:12,420
My thoughts towards Ruby and Jody and Kevin and connections is that it was all bullcrap.

823
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:20,180
It was complete indoctrination of this thing that they created."

824
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:24,020
It was also revealed that even Ruby's neighbors had contacted the police on multiple occasions

825
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:28,260
regarding her behavior, which included taping paper over her window, leaving her children

826
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:32,340
alone in the house for weeks on end, and having them pulling weeds outside in the garden in 100

827
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:36,020
degree Fahrenheit heats, stating that although the police would make an appearance, they could

828
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:40,500
never find any actual evidence of illicit activity. On Friday the 1st of September,

829
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:44,180
with evidence of videos filmed at Hildebrandt's house a couple days before placing them at the

830
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:47,780
scene of the crime, and evidence consistent with the wounds inflicted on the victims,

831
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:51,540
they were both charged with six counts of aggravated child abuse and denied bail due

832
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:54,980
to the severity of the injuries sustained, which were revealed to be allegedly from

833
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:59,620
being restrained while honey and cayenne pepper were rubbed into wounds. Over the following weeks,

834
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:03,460
old plates would re-emerge once more with the context of what we were now aware of,

835
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:07,380
leaving many to argue that this could have been prevented if authorities had acted faster.

836
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:11,380
And they're gonna say, you're hurting me, you're beating me, you're controlling us, like,

837
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:14,660
no dear, hold still, I'm getting the fire out.

838
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:18,900
Frankie appeared in court via video link on the 5th of September to defend her actions,

839
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:22,580
and with the presence of her estranged husband, state attorneys, and other parents,

840
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:27,220
proceeded to make detailed accusations of serious sexual misconduct against her own child.

841
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:31,140
She provided no evidence for this, but did not hold back, and even referred to the offspring

842
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:36,020
of people in the room. I suppose the implication is that she is using these allegations to justify

843
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:40,020
her own reactions. It didn't appear to work though, although the judge requested the child

844
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:43,780
be placed in a home with no other peers as a precautionary measure. A few days later,

845
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:47,860
adding to the ever increasing list of people speaking out, Kevin's sisters gave statements

846
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:52,180
against Ruby's claims, and also revealed more information regarding her and Kevin's separation,

847
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:56,980
stating that Jody had moved in with the Frankie's in 2022, which is when she tightened her strangle

848
00:59:56,980 --> 01:00:01,700
hold on the family, not even allowing Kevin to speak to Ruby unless she was present. Eventually

849
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:05,780
she encouraged Ruby to separate from Kevin, and he was moved to a townhouse where a minder from

850
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:10,180
connections would watch over him. The in-laws viewed Kevin as being brainwashed, and although

851
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:14,420
they believe he's a good person, they admit there are more questions than answers relating to how

852
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:18,900
he behaved throughout the situation. Like Ruby, at this point he had not made any comments to the

853
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:23,060
media, so people were unsure of his position. In a brief statement on the 18th of September,

854
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:27,140
his lawyer stated that he did not wish to point fingers and wanted to focus on rebuilding

855
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:31,060
relationships, though this did not address his involvement in the actual allegations.

856
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:34,900
This would change on the 5th of October however, when People Magazine would publish an article

857
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:38,900
titled Inside the Ruby Frankie Case, which provided a perspective from the estranged

858
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:42,820
husband with his lawyer once again doing a majority of the talking. Relating to the claims

859
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:47,380
at hand, Randy Kester, speaking on behalf of Kevin, stated that Ruby's former life companion

860
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:51,220
was shocked at hearing the details of the arrest, claiming that he had been awfully deceived into

861
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:55,460
the status of the children, and that he had only spoken to Ruby sporadically over the past year,

862
01:00:55,460 --> 01:01:00,180
with her separating from him after claiming that his attitude was infesting their family,

863
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:04,420
whatever that means, and that the oldest son had also moved out with Kevin, but Jody had stepped

864
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:08,740
in on that matter as well. His lawyer states that he was isolated from his whole family, and was

865
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:13,300
only reached out three or four times over the next year, thus was not kept in the loop regarding

866
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:17,380
the rest of the family's status. This seemed to separate him from the recent events as a whole,

867
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:21,140
in spite of the observable problems on the YouTube channel and elsewhere on social media.

868
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:24,980
It was clear that Kevin was being highly cautious about making statements to the press,

869
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:29,300
and why he had mostly refrained from doing so, he wanted custody of the remaining children,

870
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:33,380
and this was clear from the September statement. In comment sections, many were still suspicious

871
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:37,140
as to his involvement with the whole situation though, with Bonnie being quite vocal about his

872
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:41,060
inaction while it transpired, and further news being released that he had attempted to have

873
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:44,820
his daughter charged with theft following a house visit in which he took some items.

874
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:52,740
Bonnie- The one person that could have done something within his legal right was Kevin.

875
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:59,380
We had zero contact with him. It was Kevin's job to check in on things, and he did not.

876
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:04,500
With everything leading up to the arrest of Ruby Frankie and Jody Hildebrandt in mind,

877
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:08,740
their detention could have signalled an end to this terrifying saga, but it turned out to be

878
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:12,900
just the beginning of increasingly bizarre and contentious claims from all sides that only

879
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:17,060
provoked more concern, and let the living situation of vulnerable parties in limbo.

880
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:20,660
How much did certain parties know, and how much could they be trusted?

881
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:24,740
The shadow of one woman still loomed over the case.

882
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:39,540
On the 17th October 2023, the judge presiding over the case ordered it closed to the public

883
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:43,300
and the media from there on. This is probably for the best given the beast they were dealing with,

884
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:47,700
and the fact that anything said would immediately be reported on and speculated about. Ruby Frankie

885
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:51,860
still has immense power as a former content creator, and even if what she said was held

886
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:55,860
in contempt, it was still disseminated and discussed, which likely wasn't the best for

887
01:02:55,860 --> 01:03:00,180
any parties concerned. However, in spite of the subsequent silence we may see from this case,

888
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:04,100
this uncertainty will not necessarily provide security or reassurance.

889
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:08,500
On the 18th December, Ruby enters a plea deal shifting blame onto her business partner,

890
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:11,620
of which I'll give an overview soon, but with censoring set for February,

891
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:15,060
although prison time is a possibility, nothing is guaranteed.

892
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:55,220
It's difficult to say what the exact outcome will be of the following months. To all internet

893
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:59,460
dwellers, the evidence presents an open and shut case, but the real world never operates by the

894
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:02,900
rules of the world wide web, and it's not impossible that Ruby walks out of the courts

895
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:06,660
as a free citizen. However, this also does not mean that civil courts will agree with this

896
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:11,460
verdict, and going off the evidence available, they probably will not deem her fit to be a parent.

897
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:15,540
In spite of it all, there is a distinct possibility that she will come out fighting,

898
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:20,020
and that this isn't the end of the saga. She made it very clear in her court appearances the length

899
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:24,260
she is willing to go to defend her actions, and who knows what she may say about other parties

900
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:28,900
when given the opportunity to. While she still possessed a voice, she was going to use it.

901
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:33,540
Custody is a very sensitive matter that you cannot rush analysis of. To deem someone mentally

902
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:37,460
capable of overseeing the lives of multiple youths, particularly when they may have already

903
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:41,620
suffered, is something that one cannot really afford to mishandle. Yet looking at the immediate

904
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:46,100
family and potential guardians, you'd be a bit pressed to really trust anyone. When you fall

905
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:50,340
down such a rabbit hole, you're prone to often pushing the more reasonable people in your life

906
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:55,060
away, and the only people remaining are people who may be treated with suspicion. From what we know,

907
01:04:55,060 --> 01:05:00,020
Ruby cut off nearly everyone in her life, or vice versa, with only a couple exceptions,

908
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:04,660
Jodie and Kevin. I think we can rule out Jodie as a potential custody bearer, but what about

909
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:09,540
her estranged ex-husband? He had clearly set out intent to rebuild the bridges that had been burned

910
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:13,460
in the past year of their separation. Additionally, he had recently filed for divorce,

911
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:17,220
officially severing the ties between himself and his estranged wife. This seemed to be the

912
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:21,380
signs of someone determined to make his own statement, but how much could he be trusted?

913
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:27,060
Well, I'll just say it, I wanted to have sex a lot.

914
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:32,180
With cult mentality, it's very difficult to tell where the network begins and ends. In this case,

915
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:36,900
the prime individual to obtain custody over the children, Kevin, is a very untrustworthy figure.

916
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:41,220
Outside of recent events where he reportedly acted with hostility towards the eldest daughter,

917
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:45,780
accounts from even his direct family tie him very close to the connections network. We know that

918
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:52,100
they were involved from at latest 2019, before any of this transpired, and this persisted to 2022

919
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:57,300
or even 2023. Though they were very sympathetic to his predicament, as revealed in the article,

920
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:01,380
even his sisters were concerned that he was still suffering from the symptoms of brainwashing.

921
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:05,380
Regardless of whether he is a victim of cult indoctrination in this case, it doesn't make

922
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:09,380
him more mentally fit to be a parent right now. If anything, he should be focused on actually

923
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:13,140
sorting himself out before expecting a responsibility that he had demonstrably

924
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:17,620
failed to live up to in the past. Although he did not initiate the separation as far as we know,

925
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:22,500
we know he did agree to it, did not challenge it, and accepted little to no contact with his

926
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:27,380
children, even when Rui was visibly mentally deteriorating on social media. There are some

927
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:31,460
very cynical voices in this that could even say that he anticipated this happening and

928
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:35,300
agreed to the separation to give himself the best footing for a future custody case.

929
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:40,660
I know that's a very tenuous speculation, but there is a serious lack of trust right now.

930
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:47,860
So imagine going out and weeding your garden, but by weeding the garden, I mean you have this

931
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:53,700
belief that weeding the garden is plucking the leaves off of all the weeds, but you leave the

932
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:59,380
stems and the roots in place, but you just gotta weed, I gotta go pluck the little leaves off.

933
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:04,420
That's parenting today. Video archives still build a case that is skeptical of his intent.

934
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:09,300
It appeared in videos with his wife justifying their actions, actions they took while working

935
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:14,020
with connections that was a pipeline to Ruby's downward spiral. Just because he didn't go to

936
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:18,580
the extremes that his spouse did, just because he is the lesser of those two evils doesn't mean he

937
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:22,980
is the good option. So what are the choices outside of that? Well you could look towards

938
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:27,380
the rest of the family, Ruby's siblings in particular appeared quite invested in safeguarding

939
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:32,100
the children, and on the surface they didn't seem to have any direct connections to connections,

940
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:36,740
with all of them quite openly disavowing the institution after the Moms of Truth were arrested.

941
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:40,500
At the same time there were still questions surrounding their background and given how

942
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:44,740
similar it was to Ruby's, particularly given their YouTube channels, and how a large majority

943
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:50,020
of the family members have all been involved with that content at some point. Outside of the cults,

944
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:54,100
there was another network that may provoke caution within the courts and the concerned parties.

945
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:58,660
Yeah, I'll send the bull over to Ruby, you ask the question, and we can all answer, or

946
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:03,060
we don't have to all answer, just a few, so kind of just say what you want.

947
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:06,340
Although it goes without saying that Ruby's actions are not a reflection on any of the

948
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:10,900
sisters or family members at that, there was a very strong YouTube relationship built up with

949
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:15,060
her and her family in the years since the founding of the channel. I think many would agree that the

950
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:19,300
children need to be as far away from that as possible, the first thing they need is privacy.

951
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:23,540
Unfortunately, although most of the worst actions happened after the YouTube channel, it is Ruby's

952
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:27,460
influencer status that has brought her the most attention in this case. The family vlogging

953
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:32,340
network has been somewhat shaken by Ruby's actions, the only person who has made an appearance

954
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:36,420
elsewhere since Ruby distanced herself from her sisters was her daughter, who was an adult at the

955
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:40,820
time, and could make her own decisions. It would be hard for the children to have a healthy home

956
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:45,460
environment if the others still intend to upload content. Bonnie, who was probably the most vocal

957
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:49,220
about her sister's actions since the arrests were made, has made some interesting decisions on

958
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:53,860
speaking on the matter, including uploading a now deleted video where she recounted her childhood

959
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:58,660
relationship with Ruby in rather extensive detail. She deleted the video, probably realising it

960
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:02,900
wasn't necessary, and that it could also be a legally sensitive matter, but it did almost

961
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:06,820
represent one of the concerns of this sort of family affair, that when you've been online for

962
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:11,540
so long that sometimes you lose grasp of the line between what needs to be online and what can be

963
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:12,800
left for the real world.

964
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:24,340
So when I say that Ruby and Kevin and Jodie and connections have been destroying our lives offline for the last three years,

965
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:26,580
that is exactly what they've been doing.

966
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:30,580
In the years leading up to arrests, Ruby had either distanced people so much from the family

967
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:34,180
that they had no involvement in the lives of those concerned at all, or caught them in the

968
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:38,740
orbit of something so toxic that question marks loomed over their heads. As the most influential

969
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:43,140
family vlogger in a family of family vloggers, I suppose that was somewhat inevitable, because

970
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:45,780
something had been done about it sooner. Well.

971
01:09:56,980 --> 01:10:03,060
And it didn't make sense to me to hold my kids accountable, hold my kids accountable, and then

972
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:09,220
Christmas come, and then it's not consistent, and all of a sudden they get Santa Claus coming and

973
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:16,740
pouring gifts upon them. And so we're going to not be celebrating Christmas in the same way that

974
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:21,460
we've done in the past. We're going to celebrate Christmas for what it really stands for, which is

975
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:28,100
the Savior was born, and because the Savior was born, we get this beautiful opportunity to change,

976
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:32,820
our hearts get to soften, and so for Christmas we're inviting you to soften your heart.

977
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:38,500
Ruby Franke was always a strict parent, and certainly didn't act in line with many people's

978
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:42,740
expectations of a 21st century millennial mother. Nevertheless, for the times she was known for

979
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:46,180
threatening to behead fluffy toys, and not bringing a hungry daughter lunch, there would

980
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:50,100
always be people who were quite vocal in defending her as working from a more traditional parenting

981
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:53,540
model. To many of them, this was just a person who was raising a child, as they had been raised

982
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:58,180
themselves, this was a cultural and ancestral matter that had likely been held over generations,

983
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:02,500
and had seldom failed. At the same time, most of them would inevitably go on to disagree with what

984
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:06,500
the authorities discovered, and declare that she had fully lost the plots. You could see this shift

985
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:10,740
in comment sections in conservative news outlets before and after her arrest. On the other hand,

986
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:14,420
to many critics, these clips were signs that something should have been done sooner, and this

987
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:18,740
behavior was a slippery slope to what inevitably occurred. I think there is a point behind this,

988
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:22,820
at the same time there is a somewhat exceptional element to Rui's parenting that was often

989
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:27,300
overlooked, but for me it was the most indicative that something could spiral out of control.

990
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:31,700
Parents are deeply flawed like the rest of us, and some of them will fuck up, some of them will be

991
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:35,300
angry, some of them will be harsh, and some of them will make the wrong decisions occasionally

992
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:39,860
at the expense of the wellbeing of those around them. There are no mandated parenting classes,

993
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:43,300
even though you could make the argument there should be, it's fairly straightforward for many

994
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:47,940
adults to have a kid if they wish, but what's not straightforward is actually raising them.

995
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:51,700
Most people can recall a difficult stage of their childhood, and how they may have also

996
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:55,380
posed a challenge to the rest of their family, what matters is how the more mature parties

997
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:59,460
navigate that, and at what point they're willing to say that they need to change something about

998
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:04,660
themselves to help you. Bad parenting can come from a place of ignorance, other times arrogance,

999
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:08,580
other times the refusal to be a better person, something that is essential when dealing with

1000
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:12,580
people who are wired to act impulsively. Within reason, most of the time you'd recommend that

1001
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:15,940
a parent gets some professional help with how they handle children who are in a difficult

1002
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:19,780
stage of their life, and doesn't fall down that slope of actually exacerbating the problem,

1003
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:24,100
making them act out even more. However, being introduced to Ruby Frankie by the 8 Passengers

1004
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:28,100
video about what she hadn't told us, while many were rightfully struck by the severity of her

1005
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:32,580
punishment against her oldest son, I was strangely unnerved about the language she used concerning

1006
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:36,340
her youngest, and how he processed the news that he would not have access to technology

1007
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:37,660
over the coming months.

1008
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:44,460
We had the expectation that the kids would not be on the iPads.

1009
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:53,660
We said the kids would not be on the iPads.

1010
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:57,740
Now in this video, he was noticeably evasive in confronting his mother over the matter,

1011
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:01,660
very possibly because he was embarrassed about being discovered breaching the house rules,

1012
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:06,940
yet Ruby begins to use very strange language regarding his ability to be humble and sit with

1013
01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:14,300
her. The fact that he's not willing to sit with me and be humble and talk is a big,

1014
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:21,420
is a big demonstration to me that he has some distorted views and that he is in a lot of shame.

1015
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:26,620
Both my friend and I who were listening noted the same motivation, that this was someone who

1016
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:32,220
has actually been to therapy, but hasn't been properly changed by it. Jonah Hill was using

1017
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:37,020
therapy speak to control his girlfriend Sarah, his now ex-girlfriend, and it's important that

1018
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:41,260
we go over this misuse of therapy language which is kind of a thing these days.

1019
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:45,980
Throughout 2023, there has been a rise in criticism surrounding notions of therapy speak

1020
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:49,820
and over-therapy. In both of these cases, they are exemplified by people who have gone to therapy

1021
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:54,460
to address some of their issues, but haven't necessarily ameliorated them, more so finding

1022
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:58,460
new ways to justify them. This reared its head during the Jonah Hill situation this year,

1023
01:13:58,540 --> 01:14:02,780
where many felt that he had behaved possessively and masqueraded it under the pretense of setting

1024
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:07,020
boundaries. It's not really my place to hypothesise how this happens with every individual,

1025
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:11,100
but I think the greatest issue is when a person goes into therapy to not necessarily change,

1026
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:15,420
but to reinforce the perspective that their own ideas or themselves are misunderstood.

1027
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:20,140
We know that Ruby id experienced criticism pre-2020 for her parenting techniques, and

1028
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:24,460
perhaps she was feeling insecure about this, but instead of seeking out a reputable professional,

1029
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:29,180
she found connections, which we know by the 2020 upload was an organisation she was becoming

1030
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:33,420
closer with. Bad parenting can come from a multitude of sources, but if there is an element

1031
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:37,180
of reasonable doubt, there is the hope that maybe with some actual help they can address these

1032
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:41,100
problems and improve themselves. The problem with Ruby was that she'd move past that stage

1033
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:45,500
of confronting her problems, but instead opting to be an even harsher parent on the basis of the

1034
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:49,900
advice she received, and using therapy speak to defend those actions. This was not just troubling

1035
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:54,380
for her judgement, but for those around her too. This is dangerous in the sense that it can cause

1036
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:59,020
people to psychologically validate abusive dynamics, which is bad enough between two people,

1037
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:03,260
but between a parent and their child is extremely treacherous. It gives the adult no space for

1038
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:08,460
self-reflection, no room for change, no opportunity to avert disaster, because she can just turn around

1039
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:12,540
and say that if the child doesn't respond well to her disciplinary measures then it's their problem,

1040
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:17,340
which as ludicrous as it sounds is exactly how Ruby thought. For outsiders, it might be very

1041
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:22,060
apparent how flawed this perspective is, but for a family, those who may have looked up to her and

1042
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:26,140
trusted her, this was psychologically soul-destroying behaviour that could very easily

1043
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:29,820
gaslight a young person into believing that what they were suffering through was their own faults.

1044
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:38,220
So victim is a word that many of us use to acknowledge when a person is using their choices

1045
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:44,300
to not be responsible for themselves. What happens when a youngster in a difficult place doesn't

1046
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:48,700
respond well to these methods like they didn't? There was no set end for Ruby's methods because

1047
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:53,180
she's spoken to the professionals in her mind, and they've told her that she's right, and if

1048
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:57,660
people don't respond to it then they just haven't got the message yet. If she had ended up going to

1049
01:15:57,660 --> 01:16:01,900
a different therapist then this situation may have had a very different outcome, but as said,

1050
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:07,740
when you go to a therapist, you need to want to be better, and I don't think Ruby ever wanted that.

1051
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:22,860
As we know now, Ruby has pled guilty to four counts of child abuse, with two of the counts

1052
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:26,140
being dropped as part of the plea deal. Whether she will be instrumental in the case against

1053
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:30,700
Jodie is yet to be seen, but the message during this plea was unambiguous. This was a woman taken

1054
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:34,780
advantage of by a counsellor in a position of power and whose weaknesses were exploited to

1055
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:39,740
adopt increasingly radical and dangerous views. That Ruby Franky was just a devoted mother on

1056
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:44,460
the quest for continuous improvement who had been led astray. However, I think many would find this

1057
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:48,460
hard to believe with the evidence available. Allow me to explain. Ruby had always been an

1058
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:53,100
advocate of what she described as tough love. This method was something that she clearly felt

1059
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:57,820
an affinity to, and in her mind worked effectively. However, this was the 21st century, and as an

1060
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:02,220
individual posting content onto a modern platform, she was always bound to receive some pushback,

1061
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:06,060
and although she garnered the most attention in 2020, she had clearly experienced criticism

1062
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:09,500
before then, particularly regarding the treatment of their older son, who had been experiencing

1063
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:16,300
some behaviour issues. I think Ruby was always somewhat aware that her techniques were unpopular

1064
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:20,220
for their time, which is often why she stated that such conversations would occur off camera.

1065
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:23,660
This would often provide an impression that there was more bliss in the family household than there

1066
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:27,500
actually was. This didn't mean that she wasn't prone to opening herself up to criticism,

1067
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:30,780
and when you document your family and what is happening, particularly when you have an upload

1068
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:34,540
schedule to commit to, you will be drawn into these discussions, and your audience will inevitably

1069
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:38,700
be invested. An example of this was when she and Kevin had to stay at a hotel, while announcing

1070
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:42,700
that her older son had been sent to the Anasazi wilderness camp to set him straight. Regardless

1071
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:46,140
of how good the establishment may be, there were always going to be people who would take issue

1072
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:50,620
given the controversy of wilderness therapy as a whole. It was also apparent that it just wasn't

1073
01:17:50,620 --> 01:17:55,420
working on an individual basis for that son. Now when addressing results that may not line up with

1074
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:59,340
the preconceived notions of parenting that you're familiar with, you can either begin a period of

1075
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:02,780
self-reflection that may or may not lead to character growth, or you can double down on

1076
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:06,460
your approach and decide that it's everyone else who is in the wrong. Parenting is a matter that

1077
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:11,020
many people take pride in, and Ruby was certainly a proud mother, though maybe not in the sense that

1078
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:14,940
statement may typically assume. She was very committed to her styles and the results that

1079
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:18,940
she believed it yielded, however she was also a very committed proponent of authority, but a

1080
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:23,100
lot of the authority that she looked towards did not align with her outlook. Most psychologists

1081
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:26,620
and therapists would say that her techniques were certainly far from optimal in addressing

1082
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:31,020
misbehaviour, and could easily aggravate a person who is acting out. This is not something that she

1083
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:34,700
would have wanted to hear, and as a person who positioned herself as a voice of authority on

1084
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:39,340
parenting matters, she couldn't ever see herself as undermining her image. All the same she needed

1085
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:43,500
a way to respond and justify their behaviour that had more backing than just her personal

1086
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:52,220
inclinations. By her own admission, Ruby was not cash-strapped as her channel accumulated

1087
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:56,620
hundreds of millions of views each year. She was a person who had a lot of options if she wanted to

1088
01:18:56,620 --> 01:19:00,300
change her parenting style. I'm sure there were many top-end psychologists who would have told

1089
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:04,140
her in short terms what the best way to navigate the challenges that she had to inevitably confront

1090
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:08,140
were, but Ruby already had her solution to everything. She wasn't looking for advice,

1091
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:11,980
she was looking for affirmation. This is how she found the connections classroom.

1092
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:23,340
On the surface, it would be hard to look at Hildebrandt's writing and understand the direct

1093
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:28,380
relationship between escaping distortion and Ruby's insecurity over her parenting for an

1094
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:33,020
organisation initially set up to help individuals overcome addiction. The parenting course,

1095
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:37,420
although full of the usual cultish buzzwords we've become used to, still seems to teach

1096
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:41,500
principles that you'd feel are quite inoffensive at their core. However, when you take a closer

1097
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:45,740
look at the syllabus, you realise that actually, the parenting really mentions nothing about what

1098
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:50,220
the parents do, and you realise that what appealed to Ruby was not the fact that she could fix

1099
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:53,340
herself, it was the fact that she thought she could fix her kids.

1100
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:31,420
I'm not going to pay $220 for the connections parenting classes,

1101
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:36,140
but the summary really tells you most of what you need to know. That children, like adults,

1102
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:41,340
are in this constant state of distortion, and that your job as a parent is to lead them out of it.

1103
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:44,860
How do you do that? Well, you have to show them the way forward, but ultimately they are steps

1104
01:20:44,860 --> 01:20:49,020
you cannot make for them. Probably the most illuminating quote in the course summary reads,

1105
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:53,820
the motivation to self-care must come from each individual. Nobody can do it for you,

1106
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:58,620
and you cannot do it for your children. They must learn, and it's our responsibility to teach them

1107
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:03,420
how to care for themselves. This seems to ideologically line up to the mother who wouldn't

1108
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:07,820
take lunch to her six-year-old when she forgot to make it. Beyond that, though, there is this very

1109
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:12,460
interesting combination of ideas in how connections and Hildebrandt view parenting. It's not really a

1110
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:16,780
parent's job to care for their children, but it's also a parent's job to teach a child to care for

1111
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:22,380
themselves. How do you teach someone that way without caring, without providing some form of

1112
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:50,780
actual support? Within connections, Ruby Franke found the ends to justify those means,

1113
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:55,260
and as she came under stronger criticisms, she dug her heels in more. After all, now she could

1114
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:58,860
respond to those people calling her out saying that she had talked to licensed professionals,

1115
01:21:58,860 --> 01:22:02,620
who advised that it was actually a completely just punishment to confiscate a bed for seven

1116
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:07,020
months from their son who played pranks on their brother. From her perspective, it simultaneously

1117
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:11,820
washed her hands of responsibility while proving her methods correct, but many outsiders saw it

1118
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:16,780
for the farce and cop-out that it was, and voted with their viewership. This pushed Ruby further,

1119
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:20,620
taking up more responsibility in the connections classroom, strengthening her bond with Jodie,

1120
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:24,540
who not just adored her commitment to the cause, but also her subscriber count and the clout that

1121
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:29,340
she pulled. It was true that Ruby Franke was drawn into a cult-like mentality, but only because she

1122
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:34,540
felt the world around her needed to change, rather than herself. As an internet literate person with

1123
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:38,620
access to review websites and media platforms that say more than I have, there were plenty of

1124
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:42,380
signs that she could have picked up to tell her that this was a course that may not be the best

1125
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:47,820
for those around her. The connections had torn families apart, but Ruby didn't care about that,

1126
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:53,340
she cared about herself, and how she had to be right in her ways. If that isn't distortion,

1127
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:59,260
then I don't know what is. Ruby Franke didn't want to be better, she wanted to be the best,

1128
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:02,700
and yet that hubris led her to be one of the worst.

1129
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:09,340
Jodie's latest victim was this eight channels lady. I knew in two seconds, I knew in two

1130
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:17,580
seconds, that Jodie absolutely wanted that lady's platform to become more powerful, and then she

1131
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:24,620
would lie to that lady, she would make that lady as mentally sick as a dog, then she would lie to

1132
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:28,620
her like she was helping her, and then she would steal that lady's power. For more information

1133
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:33,020
on Jodie and how dangerous she truly was, I recommend watching J Aubrey's video on the matter,

1134
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:36,300
and I'll also link a few other illuminating pieces in the pinned comment as well.

1135
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:52,140
Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting different results. Although

1136
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:56,780
its origins aren't known for certain, it's often accredited to Albert Einstein, and although there's

1137
01:23:56,860 --> 01:24:01,900
obviously a nuance to it, I think he had a point. Following the arrest of Ruby Franke, one of her

1138
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:05,820
sisters in law recalled a time where she had come round for dinner, and had proceeded to chastise

1139
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:09,980
her for letting her own children have snacks after food, claiming that they were running a mock

1140
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:15,180
in the kitchen. Ruby didn't just view her parenting as the right way, she viewed it as the only way,

1141
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:20,380
and she viewed her platform as a way to spread that message, but like many hypothesised narcissists,

1142
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:25,100
their usual channel isn't really a way to spread that message, it's more to create a whole new one

1143
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:29,420
entirely. When going over the 8 Passengers YouTube channel, you'll find countless moments

1144
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:33,020
of bliss and harmony within the family. The overarching theme was that this was a group of

1145
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:37,980
people who were happy with each other's company, documented by a doting mother who just wanted to

1146
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:42,140
capture those fleeting snapshots as a permanent time capsule for the collective memory, but there

1147
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:53,180
was something deeper to the channel and how she approached it. One of the challenges regarding

1148
01:24:53,180 --> 01:24:57,740
watching family channels, is how they often present an ideated version of how a family

1149
01:24:57,740 --> 01:25:02,300
operates, particularly for those who either want to be parents, or are parents already,

1150
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:06,460
and looking for guidance. There's a lot of selective footage, in a way that's what you'd

1151
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:09,900
expect, not everything needs to be a part of a YouTube channel, particularly if you want to

1152
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:14,380
reflect on those memories fondly. Nevertheless, a lot of people saw the image that the Franke's

1153
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:19,340
projected onto their channel, and often asked Ruby how her children were so wonderful and obedient.

1154
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:23,580
The secret was that most of the time, you don't talk about the times where that parental style

1155
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:29,180
falls short, and from the evidence available, it did so on multiple occasions. An often overlooked

1156
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:33,820
detail in the May 2020 upload, What We Haven't Told You, was Ruby talking about the instances

1157
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:37,580
her oldest son had played a variety of pranks on his brother, and choosing to list an example

1158
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:41,100
that literally happened on the day he came back from the Anasazi wilderness camp.

1159
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:59,980
Those are not signs of a person who is responding well to your castigation, not to mention that

1160
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:04,540
Anasazi was already the result of years of misbehaviour by their own accounts. Of course,

1161
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:08,380
people wouldn't receive this impression if you watched 8 Passengers content most of the time,

1162
01:26:08,380 --> 01:26:12,060
because that's not what they showed, but the son clearly didn't appreciate this, and one of the

1163
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:16,220
few details from the insider interview that I actually believe was that her son had encouraged

1164
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:20,700
to upload the video in its current form. My personal belief is that I think he anticipated

1165
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:24,700
the backlash it would receive, in the past he'd encourage his mother to talk about the discipline

1166
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:29,340
he was subjected to, while she was often the more evasive. So although I can say that I think Ruby

1167
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:33,420
was extremely hard headed in the best way to raise her children, she was also very aware of the

1168
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:38,060
negative press that this would generate, but she just couldn't reconcile both without sacrificing

1169
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:43,340
her pride or her reputation. So the natural outcome is she's just going to need to be hungry,

1170
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:51,180
and hopefully nobody gives her food, and nobody steps in and gives her a lunch. Probably the most

1171
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:55,260
illuminating example of this was her response to the withholding of sustenance from her daughter,

1172
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:58,940
and the accompanying clip. In the insider interview, she attempts to reframe it as a

1173
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:02,700
matter she was actually very sympathetic to, and would've helped if she could have,

1174
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:06,140
and although there may be context around the clip that we're not aware of, there's also just

1175
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:10,860
a callousness in the clip itself that could not be alternatively contextualised. She knew that

1176
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:15,260
this was often frowned upon, and when the fire was put to her feet, she exhibited cowardice.

1177
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:20,140
If she really was as committed to the regime as she said she was, why would she backtrack?

1178
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:25,020
Because the YouTube channel was more important, how she was perceived was more important than how

1179
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:30,780
she was, yet she was never wrong, she couldn't be wrong. There was this continuous narrative that

1180
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:34,860
people just didn't get it, they didn't have an understanding, they weren't mature enough,

1181
01:27:34,860 --> 01:27:39,100
they didn't possess the full context, and although all these are viable responses in a case by case

1182
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:43,340
scenario, here they felt more like rhetorical devices to keep Ruby and Kevin in the right.

1183
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:47,180
There was always something that people didn't know that meant that the Frankies could not be

1184
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:51,020
judged. Their evidence of good parenting was right in front of them, their content,

1185
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:55,580
and their children, perhaps one in the same in their mind. Ruby Frankie used the YouTube

1186
01:27:55,580 --> 01:28:00,700
channel to create a reality where her disciplinary methods resulted in a happy family, with her

1187
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:04,860
and her husband even boasting that when CPS came by their house, they remarked that they would

1188
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:09,980
actually have to start watching their YouTube content to get some tips on parenting, a comment

1189
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:14,620
so close to satire itself that it may well be true. Yet after the run-in with the internet,

1190
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:18,220
they all stepped back from this narrative entirely, and often avoided any mention of

1191
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:23,020
discipline at all. In turn, the YouTube channel became this medium to fabricate a family that

1192
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:27,500
only really existed in Ruby's mind to present to the audience for their consumption, the one where

1193
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:31,420
she holds them to account, they embrace their retribution, and then they grow up to be these

1194
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:36,140
wonderful members of society, all thanks to her and her wonderful mothering techniques.

1195
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:40,380
In this case, the 8 Passengers channel became a damaging platform for the family's wellbeing,

1196
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:45,180
because what once was an illusion had now become a delusion. Ruby was using the platform to throw

1197
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:49,020
up a smokescreen not just for her viewers, but for herself, but if you looked at the evidence,

1198
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:53,660
everything was going perfectly fine. Yet this just made it less believable because they hadn't

1199
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:57,420
committed to changing anything at all, and if nothing had changed about their methods,

1200
01:28:57,420 --> 01:29:01,740
how could they suddenly present this image that everything was hunky-dory now? The people on

1201
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:06,220
YouTube did not buy it, and as the views fell, so did the validation. Like many people with

1202
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:10,620
narcissistic tendencies, Ruby was steadfast but fragile, and still needed to hear that

1203
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:15,340
everything was fine, boasting about her methods on podcasts with her new partner in crime.

1204
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:20,940
I was really hoping that like, keeping them home from school and wiping the floorboards would like,

1205
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:27,020
really bring pain. Like, oh my gosh, I really want to change this behaviour that I've been

1206
01:29:27,020 --> 01:29:31,740
exhibiting. And then it didn't, it didn't, like, it wasn't painful for them. They're like, oh yeah,

1207
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:35,020
we get to stay home from school and clean floorboards. This is kind of fun. It's like, ah,

1208
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:41,260
so, you know, they've had these visceral experiences, you know, and they haven't,

1209
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:46,220
they haven't affected them. It's because they're so numb. The truth was that it wasn't fine,

1210
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:50,460
but nobody could prove it, because Ruby was too proud to admit that she was losing control of

1211
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:54,060
everything, and that she would rather go down with her methods than change her ways,

1212
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:57,900
that she would rather commit to a cult that validates her perceptions than actually get

1213
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:02,780
serious help. In her mind, her punishments were just the consequences rather than the cause,

1214
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:05,980
and yet everyone had to live with them.

1215
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:16,140
Probably the most indicative piece of evidence that showed her character was her own court

1216
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:20,060
appearance, where she implied that such harsh abuse against one of her own children could be

1217
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:24,300
justified by launching into a series of allegations regarding sexual misconduct. I

1218
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:28,700
obviously cannot comment on the verity of such claims, but it encapsulated the perfect mix of

1219
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:33,740
cowardice and callousness, the refusal to admit that she had failed as a parent alongside the

1220
01:30:33,740 --> 01:30:38,140
context that means she was right all along. To me, this defence was a symptom that Jodie

1221
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:42,460
and Ruby were careening towards some sort of modern-day exorcism scenario, where they could

1222
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:46,940
create this reality that they had to purge evil from this person rather than actually seeing the

1223
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:51,020
evil in themselves that was driving them to do this. This was confirmed on the 90th of December

1224
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:54,940
when details of Ruby's behaviour were revealed, of which I'm not going to verbally list out and

1225
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:58,300
would recommend the faint of heart to turn away, but could be seen on the screen now,

1226
01:30:58,300 --> 01:31:02,700
it is as horrifying as one may conceptualise. The justification for these acts was that those

1227
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:07,020
she did this to were possessed, sometimes to justify one act of evil you have to create a

1228
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:11,820
greater one, and as a person who was hellbent on being right, no matter how awful Ruby was,

1229
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:15,900
in her mind she was always fighting against something worse, but really she was just

1230
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:19,980
fighting her own reflection. We could sit here and debate whether an adult will reflect on the

1231
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:24,540
time their mum wouldn't bring them lunch, but as a pattern of behaviour it was toxic, and what Ruby

1232
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:28,940
and Jodie did together will probably live with the effect of parties for the foreseeable future,

1233
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:33,020
and that is a tragedy. The psychological justifications of such cruelty to those

1234
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:37,500
vulnerable will likely take a long time to fully disentangle, to realise that actually this wasn't

1235
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:42,140
their fault. Ruby Franky may not have entered parenthood with bad intentions, but her vanity

1236
01:31:42,140 --> 01:31:46,220
was corrupted by an online following and her failure to choose to actually put her family

1237
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:49,900
first. To die on a hill that she had known for so long would eventually lead to one of the most

1238
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:54,540
horrific outcomes, one whose legacy will remain long after she's forgotten by the internet.

1239
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:59,660
The truth is that most people who end up doing pretty shitty things aren't born that way,

1240
01:31:59,660 --> 01:32:03,660
there are a lot of people out there who are just perpetuating a cycle that has been passed down

1241
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:08,780
to them. Does it change the notion of accountability? Not necessarily, but it also

1242
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:13,340
doesn't change the tragedy, that if they'd had a healthier upbringing they wouldn't have ended up

1243
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:18,300
the way they were. People like Ruby risk maintaining the cycle, and if a child commits

1244
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:22,060
something awful under the sort of duress that we know that Jodie and Ruby placed them under,

1245
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:26,620
then that couple will also bear responsibility for those misdeeds as well. How are humans meant

1246
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:30,940
to learn healthy relationships if all they've ever known is abuse? For a person who preached

1247
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:36,300
responsibility, Ruby couldn't acknowledge any, that she ultimately had fallen far short.

1248
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:40,700
I don't believe that she was always this way, but it's like driving a car towards an unfinished

1249
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:44,700
bridge while everyone else is bailing out of it. Ruby smashed the accelerator.

1250
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:54,300
Parenting isn't always an easy job, shout out to those who had very troubled childhoods, and

1251
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:59,260
even early adulthoods as well. But parenting is a necessary job, sometimes the only constant you

1252
01:32:59,260 --> 01:33:03,980
have in your life is your family, they're integral to grounding a sense of self. I don't think there's

1253
01:33:03,980 --> 01:33:07,980
a one size fits all approach, and different solutions will work with different challenges,

1254
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:12,380
but I do think navigating the exasperation of being a parent in those situations should never

1255
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:17,100
manifest into resentment and vitriol, something which harsher systems can risk if not responded

1256
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:22,540
well to. It's a cycle of punishment that will only beget harsher punishments. The Frankies went into

1257
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:26,700
parenting with a perception of discipline that was more corporal and traditional, this is something

1258
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:31,180
they agreed to and enforced together. This was also something they decided to partially document,

1259
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:34,780
in the years after their channel was set up, they garnered a significant following of people

1260
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:39,420
who admired their practices, capturing the good times, but showing parents, and aspiring parents

1261
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:43,980
who may be a bit lost on handling troubled youngsters, a way forward. As the older sister,

1262
01:33:43,980 --> 01:33:48,380
her authority was affirmed as she grew to be the most influential channel in her family network,

1263
01:33:48,380 --> 01:33:53,260
and she gladly accepted the reigns as a reliable voice on parenting, yet all of this changed when

1264
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:56,540
she decided to upload more information than people probably should have known.

1265
01:33:57,340 --> 01:34:02,540
Show that he was not able to manage himself sharing a bedroom with...

1266
01:34:02,540 --> 01:34:07,260
In the month after, Ruby partook in a campaign to defend her character against many who felt

1267
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:11,340
that her authoritarian approach crossed a line, utilising unreasonable and disproportionate

1268
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:15,580
punishment for what was at worst mild mischief. Judging from her language in responses and

1269
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:19,260
interviews, she was winning the ideological battle in her mind, and that there were no

1270
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:23,500
words that anyone else could say that could break that family. That may have well been true,

1271
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:27,260
but as the eight passengers YouTube channel stagnated and began to lose subscribers,

1272
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:31,340
there was a sign that people weren't completely happy with what the channel had presented. Ruby

1273
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:35,820
and Kevin both seemed to lament this with great disdain, booing themselves as victims of cancel

1274
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:40,300
culture over a year after the incident. It was clear that Ruby in particular still felt deeply

1275
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:45,340
bitter about this. She was wronged online, and she needed to prove that she was right all along.

1276
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:50,540
We are getting mentally fit the same way your body would get physically fit by running and

1277
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:56,060
lifting weights and working with a personal trainer. We are getting ready to be your

1278
01:34:56,060 --> 01:35:00,780
mental fitness trainer. That's where connections came in. Headed by someone who believed we all

1279
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:04,860
could have complete control over ourselves, Frankie's ideas surrounding parenting were

1280
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:09,180
validated by a doctrine that showed you had to rescue your children from the distorted world

1281
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:13,740
they were growing up in, that it wasn't her that was wrong, it was the world, it was the commentators,

1282
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:18,380
it was her sisters, it was her oldest daughter, it was even her husband in the end. The Frankie's

1283
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:21,980
went into parenting with a perception of discipline that was more corporal and traditional.

1284
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:26,700
This is something they agreed to, but they emerged separate, a family broken apart by one person's

1285
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:31,500
inability to change, at least for the better, a person who would rather be enabled than challenged.

1286
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:36,460
Even then, with federal charges filed against her, sat in court, and facing down those her actions

1287
01:35:36,460 --> 01:35:41,500
had affected, it was still someone else's fault. For this time, it wasn't the viewers, it wasn't

1288
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:46,460
the commenters, it wasn't the critics, it was the children, the children who made Ruby's child

1289
01:35:46,460 --> 01:35:50,300
possible in the first place, the children who viewers tuned in to watch, who likely didn't

1290
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:54,540
receive a modicum of the millions that Ruby outwardly states she made. After being provided

1291
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:59,660
by so much from her family, Ruby Frankie was ready to throw them under the school bus, an irony still

1292
01:35:59,660 --> 01:36:04,060
somewhat beyond comprehension, if there was a genuine human being who cared about anyone but

1293
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:09,580
herself, they were buried very deep down. Ruby really was willing to lose everything for the

1294
01:36:09,580 --> 01:36:15,660
sake of being right, and she might well do, but nobody really wins, someone is losing a sister,

1295
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:19,740
someone is losing a daughter, someone is losing a mother, but for many,

1296
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:24,540
Ruby Frankie was already gone. So, what was left?

1297
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:39,820
I think today is going to be one of those days I'm not a very good mom.

1298
01:36:39,820 --> 01:36:43,260
Regardless of the centres that Ruby receives in the following year, she will still likely live

1299
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:47,820
another few decades to say the least, she will go on with her life, and hopefully not ruin any

1300
01:36:47,820 --> 01:36:52,220
others in the process. Everyone online will mostly move on, and her name will spark a sort of

1301
01:36:52,220 --> 01:36:57,180
reminiscence amongst internet culture enthusiasts. Nevertheless, even though her channels have been

1302
01:36:57,180 --> 01:37:02,140
deleted, the remnants of her philosophy, and the actions that philosophy led to, will live on.

1303
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:06,940
Ironic that her channel originally created to compile fond family memories now only serves as

1304
01:37:06,940 --> 01:37:11,820
a highlight reel for Ruby's worst moments. It's hard to say whether this is a good thing or not,

1305
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:15,980
some might say that YouTube served as important documentation for what will inevitably be used

1306
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:19,820
to hold her accountable, but you could also say that she may have never reached that stage

1307
01:37:19,820 --> 01:37:24,140
if she hadn't made the decision to open the channel. I think one of the most harmful aspects

1308
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:28,220
of a family channel is inevitably how it alters the family's trajectory in general,

1309
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:31,980
particularly if the subjects of those videos aren't performative themselves.

1310
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:36,860
8 Passengers was one of those channels, defined by the publication of intimate details with millions

1311
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:40,860
watching. I don't think you can ever guarantee being entirely the same person when a camera

1312
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:46,060
switched on, and having an on-camera and off-camera parent is not a healthy dynamic in my mind.

1313
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:50,540
At least with acting, there is a clear distinction between what is real and what isn't. With this

1314
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:55,180
sort of YouTube channel, how can a youngster tell which is the real parent and which isn't?

1315
01:37:55,180 --> 01:38:03,180
I totally ignored you today. Are you okay with that? Because you know I don't do it every day.

1316
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:09,260
Do you think it's okay for mom to take care of herself for a day? Okay, thanks for being

1317
01:38:09,260 --> 01:38:13,820
thoughtful. Ruby Frankie was never a particularly good parent, it needs to be said,

1318
01:38:13,820 --> 01:38:18,140
reflecting on even the more pedestrian content she seems incredibly vain and full of herself

1319
01:38:18,140 --> 01:38:22,060
when it comes to the subject of raising children, and was never really open to alternative views

1320
01:38:22,060 --> 01:38:25,500
or methods that would probably have been much better for her family as a whole.

1321
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:30,460
YouTube can't personality test people who decide to upload content, there has to be a degree of

1322
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:34,380
personal responsibility to protect the freedoms of others, and although you wouldn't necessarily

1323
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:38,620
say that YouTube makes a good person bad, the public attention it generates can definitely

1324
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:42,860
corrupt an individual and exploit character flaws that make them more prone to behaving in

1325
01:38:42,860 --> 01:38:46,940
destructive ways. That's a pretty significant detail when dealing with channels that actively

1326
01:38:46,940 --> 01:38:52,380
feature vulnerable parties. With 8 Passengers, Ruby's vanity was fed by a viewership who admired

1327
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:56,620
the couple's parenting, and thought they were seeing the results, perhaps even a way back for

1328
01:38:56,620 --> 01:39:01,420
them to the happy family that they desired. By 2019, the channel wasn't just a harmless memory

1329
01:39:01,420 --> 01:39:05,820
bank, it was a well-oiled commercial machine, but also a platform for Ruby to spread content

1330
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:10,220
that in her mind was absolutely necessary for parents to see. This was her mission,

1331
01:39:10,220 --> 01:39:14,940
it regularly led to her uploading videos that in hindsight many felt were too invasive or revealing,

1332
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:19,500
and they were, but this was her own personal crusade, it's how she gave her self-purpose.

1333
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:23,660
She modelled the importance of her parenting on the view and sub-counts she acquired,

1334
01:39:23,660 --> 01:39:27,740
and for a while that validated her. However, like all Passengers perspectives, it wasn't a

1335
01:39:27,740 --> 01:39:32,140
criticism-free zone either, a lot of people raised issue with how she behaved in content and her

1336
01:39:32,140 --> 01:39:36,940
penal system, first surfacing after she sent her oldest son to Anasazi, but most famously emerging

1337
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:46,220
when they spoke about her disciplinary system in a video. This was a double-edged sword as well,

1338
01:39:46,220 --> 01:39:50,620
because although people did the right thing and criticised it, with commentators being made aware

1339
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:55,100
of something that could actually be scrutinised, it didn't aid the family relationship. This is not

1340
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:59,340
the sort of thing that really should have been spoken about in a video uploaded to YouTube,

1341
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:03,340
it's embarrassing for the son, but also not remotely useful for the mother. Really,

1342
01:40:03,340 --> 01:40:07,420
this is the sort of matter that should have been brought up in a private space where Ruby didn't

1343
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:11,180
have to put on the front that YouTube required of her, because she wasn't going to listen to

1344
01:40:11,180 --> 01:40:15,660
people who didn't know those in her life from Adam. It's hard to say if there was anyone in

1345
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:19,660
this world that Ruby would listen to who didn't agree with her, but there were definitely people

1346
01:40:19,660 --> 01:40:23,980
she wouldn't. However, just as YouTube was an ego-boost during the channel's viral era,

1347
01:40:23,980 --> 01:40:28,220
it's demise after this controversy would have put a significant dent in the ego of Frankie,

1348
01:40:28,220 --> 01:40:31,900
who in probably the most symptomatic turn of someone who felt their pride was under attack,

1349
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:36,300
decided to create a platform entirely dedicated to defending her parenting practice and YouTube

1350
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:40,940
channel under the cult backdrop, even replacing her family channel's Instagram with it. I can't

1351
01:40:40,940 --> 01:40:44,860
tell you how aware Ruby was of her own indoctrination, but it's occurrence was a

1352
01:40:44,860 --> 01:40:49,180
result of her not being able to stomach her own failure on a website that her self-worth as a

1353
01:40:49,180 --> 01:40:53,580
parent had become dangerously intertwined with, but her narcissism prevented her from taking

1354
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:54,940
responsibility for.

1355
01:40:54,940 --> 01:41:00,220
Ruby- The power comes in the little things, and it's so fitting that I hit a million while I was

1356
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:04,620
trying to squeeze in as many of those little things as I could.

1357
01:41:04,620 --> 01:41:08,540
It should go without saying, but a subscriber count or a view count is not a reflection of

1358
01:41:08,540 --> 01:41:13,740
your ability. Popularity and skill are not always correlated. In the case of Ruby Frankie,

1359
01:41:13,740 --> 01:41:17,900
her family generated popularity that she attributed to herself, but her subsequent

1360
01:41:17,900 --> 01:41:21,820
failure was something she could only blame on others. You can't point towards YouTube as being

1361
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:25,660
responsible for that, but you do have to question how healthy that is for anyone, when the

1362
01:41:25,660 --> 01:41:30,700
consequences that mentality yields are only felt by those who don't have a say in it. It wasn't the

1363
01:41:30,700 --> 01:41:35,740
viewers, it wasn't the commenters, it wasn't the critics, it was the children, and just like she

1364
01:41:35,740 --> 01:41:41,180
blamed them in court, she likely blamed them at home as well. Ruby Frankie was a bad parent,

1365
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:46,860
who only became worse over time and reminded some of us how fortunate we are, but she was also a

1366
01:41:46,860 --> 01:41:51,740
symptom of the morality of family content and the moral dubiousness that surrounds it. We may not

1367
01:41:51,740 --> 01:41:56,700
be able to ascertain the magnitude of the role her public status played in her eventual downward

1368
01:41:56,700 --> 01:42:01,020
spiral, but it's certainly a stark reminder that if you love the channel more than your children,

1369
01:42:01,660 --> 01:42:05,740
you probably shouldn't have either. Family channels. Needless to say,

1370
01:42:05,740 --> 01:42:10,060
they still haven't won me over quite yet. Thank you for watching.

1371
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:17,660
Hey there guys, so that was the video, I hope you enjoyed it. Well, at least took something

1372
01:42:17,660 --> 01:42:22,300
away from it, maybe not the most enjoyable subject. I want to give a big thanks to the

1373
01:42:22,300 --> 01:42:27,100
editors, their names are up on the screen right now, and of course the wonderful people who've

1374
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:34,140
helped me out post-editing, Kojak, fantastic work as always, Onuski on audio, and Starfo on

1375
01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:39,740
the thumbnails. Thank you again guys, your work is very much treasured and I really do appreciate it.

1376
01:42:39,740 --> 01:42:45,500
Also gotta give big thanks to the patrons, as always, $10 patrons up on screen right now,

1377
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:51,420
and a special thanks to the $50 patrons, Hypercube, Esther Bedoya, and Sari Tish,

1378
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:55,980
thank you again for your support, it really means a lot. Also wanna give a big thanks to the artists

1379
01:42:55,980 --> 01:43:00,940
whose art has been in this video. Like everyone here, all the credits are in the pinned comment,

1380
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:04,860
and if you wanna go and check out their work, then I encourage you to. I don't think there's

1381
01:43:04,860 --> 01:43:11,660
too much else to say, other than I hope you guys have a good Christmas, or break, or none of those

1382
01:43:11,740 --> 01:43:15,820
things, maybe you're not about second breaks, it's fine by me, whatever works for you,

1383
01:43:15,820 --> 01:43:20,460
and I hope 2023 has been good to you, but if not, I hope the next one's a bit better. Until then,

1384
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:24,140
I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you, in the next one.
