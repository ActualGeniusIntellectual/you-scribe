00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
Let's have a little chat, then, lads.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,260
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,900
and music, probably the most volatile industry of recent, and the subject of today's question.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,900
When we talk about recent movements, obviously the first one that comes into our head is Me Too,

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,260
which obviously inspired many women to come forward about their sexual maltreatment by celebrities,

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,260
primarily in the film and journalism industry, though it did have outreach into other sectors.

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,980
Some very large names were taken down, while others very slyly sneaked out of the spotlight during the allegations.

8
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,860
However, there was one industry that was eerily quiet, and that was the music industry,

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,320
and now there were a few, Russell Simmons probably being the most famous of all,

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,300
but that was more from an executive position, and even then, the coverage has been minimal,

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,740
which is surprising considering the claims are quite numerous against him.

12
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,020
For those who are familiar with my channel, you'll know that I'm a keen follower of music.

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,780
If I wanted to start up my own review medium, I probably could.

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,460
I like to see myself as someone who, quote, gets around 99% of music.

15
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,500
Recently, there's been a trend of what many regard as Soundclown rappers.

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,980
Now, this is headed by names like Lil Pump, XXXTentacion, Lil Uzi Vert, Lil Yachty, you know, lots of Lil people.

17
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,700
I bet some of them aren't even small, misleading cunts.

18
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:16,940
However, obviously rap is typically a more gritty genre, and therefore some of its output is gonna be more controversial.

19
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:21,660
At the pinnacle of this controversy, one of the Soundclown artists to emerge was 6ix9ine,

20
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:26,060
or Tekashi 6ix9ine, as some call him, and his music is interesting.

21
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,540
That's an appropriate word to describe it. However, that's not the only interesting thing about him.

22
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,500
To understand the premise of what I'm gonna be talking about today,

23
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,620
and why he's more than just the typical interesting individual, I'm gonna have to get some help in,

24
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:43,740
because, to be honest, although I know the basics of his case, I don't really know what his persona is like.

25
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,780
So, to understand why he's so controversial, I've decided to bring on Soundclown rap connoisseur,

26
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,660
Vanilla Rice, to explain exactly why he's causing a stir,

27
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,420
following which I will talk about the greater point being made. Take it away.

28
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,820
Hello, everyone, and welcome to my part of the video. I've been asked to talk about Tekashi 6ix9ine.

29
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:06,140
Now, the thing about Tekashi 6ix9ine is that, to me, personally, I feel like he's set such a bad precedent

30
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:11,900
for so many internet, or Soundcloud rappers, or up-and-coming artists, and it's just not good.

31
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,340
Tekashi 6ix9ine, so you might have heard of him. You might have heard this song.

32
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:21,580
Or this song.

33
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,540
Or this song.

34
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:38,140
Or you might have heard all of them, and thought they were one song. Now, usually, I don't say that.

35
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:44,380
Usually, I don't say, oh, oh, oh, this rap and all of his songs sound the same. But this, it's genuinely, like,

36
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:51,740
the same flow, and the same sort of beat, and the same sort of lyrical consistency of all of his other songs,

37
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,620
of all of his hits. I just don't appreciate that. The only reason he's relevant is because he always

38
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,420
maintains a state of controversy, and he's always in the media for doing something controversial,

39
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:09,100
either touching kids, or shooting a gun, or, uh, saying, oh, test my gangsta. Test it. Test my gangsta.

40
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,220
Test my gangsta. Come test my gangsta, you know what I'm saying?

41
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,500
I want people to test my gangsta. Test my gangsta. The thing I don't like about it is, because he,

42
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:23,100
like, he still maintains his relevancy. He still maintains it from DJ Akademiks, who covers him,

43
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,180
like, every day of the week, because he's always doing something. Like, the other day, he was shooting

44
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,140
a gun. He was in, like, a gunfight. He was just squaring up to people, because he was, like, because of

45
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:37,820
his actions, where he goes, test my gangsta. People have now tested his gangsta, and they brought out

46
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:43,500
guns, and he was, like, because he maintains this sort of drama all the time, and I don't appreciate

47
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:50,780
it. He hasn't done anything revolutionary. His flow isn't anything, any, like, revolutionary thing.

48
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,540
His lyrical consistency, it's not revolutionary. It's just hype music. It's just because he's got

49
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,180
rainbow hair, that he's sort of stood out, and everyone's gone, oh, yeah, that guy's got rainbow

50
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:05,980
hair. He might be cool. There's allegations around that he's touched kids, and people support him. I

51
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:11,180
don't understand. I think I understand why people are drawn to him. It's because he's such a crazy,

52
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:16,300
weird character, and he's such a, I don't know what I want to say, anti-hero. I don't know.

53
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:22,140
I don't know what to sort of classify him in. He's just 6'9". He's just insane, and he looks weird.

54
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,540
He's just scary. I don't like him. He's just, what is he? Why has he done that to himself? And the

55
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,780
fact that he's done that to himself just to achieve fame means that, like, you know, he's changed his

56
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,260
appearance. He's like, oh, that. Oh, I'm just expressing myself. I'm just expressing myself.

57
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:41,020
No, mate. You've done that just so you stand out and you maintain your relevancy on no,

58
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,300
like, merit. It's just on your appearance and your insane personality.

59
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:07,980
No one cares. Why are we keeping him relevant? If an artist has to maintain

60
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:15,340
a state of drama, and has to maintain a state of drama to stay relevant, then

61
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,100
why? Why are we giving them the time of day? It's only his appearance and the way he conducts

62
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:28,780
himself that keeps him relevant. And that's just my opinion on it. And again, it's a bad precedent

63
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,900
for people trying to get up to the top, because kids will be like, you know, the kids that want

64
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,780
to become rappers will be like, oh, 6ix9ine, he did it. Oh, I'm gonna rip my teeth out and,

65
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:46,060
I don't know, get a Glock and go out on the town and all that stuff. And I just, I don't appreciate

66
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,700
what he's done for hip hop. All right? That's just my opinion. Thank you for letting me on your

67
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:56,460
channel, James, or The Right Opinion, or whatever. It's been a good one. Please subscribe to me,

68
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:02,060
or follow me on Twitter, or both, so that would be really appreciative. Thank you. Peace out,

69
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,500
home dogs. Thank you, Vanilla Rice. Go check him out. He makes some spicy content. Now, being the

70
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,460
very gracious gentleman he is, he sent me his part before I wrote this script, so I can actually write

71
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,660
it with that information in mind. Now, to nuance onto Vanilla Rice's point about touching kids,

72
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:22,060
what he meant by that is that 6ix9ine was actually convicted of use of a child in a sexual

73
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,220
performance. Now listen, I'm not here to discuss the case in too much depth, but if you want my

74
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,980
brief hot take, 6ix9ine is talking out his ass. He's lied about every other detail of the

75
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,460
situation and been called out on it, rightfully so. But one thing that has not been disputed is

76
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,860
that he pled guilty to the following crime, and it's a fairly incriminating description. Now,

77
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,260
in many industries, such a conviction would be career-ending, yet he's one of the few that,

78
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:48,300
even with such information public, allows him to do what he desires, and still gives him an

79
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,940
opportunity to make a hell of a lot of money. Why, I hear you ask? At the height of one of the

80
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:58,860
most monumental social movements in recent history, is a person so antithetic to that?

81
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:04,780
Becoming a mainstream artist. Well firstly, music is a very heavily consumer-based market. A lot of

82
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,940
power to decide what is going to be hit lies with much of the buyer, and as many artists tend to

83
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,420
have a signature style, people tend to base it on the quality of the music rather than the character

84
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,820
of the person making it. Whereas in a film, swapping an individual actor out may not be

85
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,900
too much of a difference, in music the artist is much more central to the final product,

86
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,300
making record labels much more reluctant to drop an artist as they're not as expendable as those

87
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,940
who contribute to other industries. Chris Brown is still notching top 100 hits to this day, and he

88
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,900
continued to score huge singles years after the domestic abuse case, which would have ended many

89
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,300
careers in many various persuasions. This conveniently brings us to our second point.

90
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,220
The music is a much more individual art. People aren't just supporting the music, they're often

91
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,460
supporting the artist. The artist is often at the helm of their creation. If you're an actor and you

92
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,140
want to be in a film, and one of the many executives object to your inclusion, then you're

93
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:56,380
chucked. Even without a label, you could still make hits. In fact, given the current internet

94
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:01,100
nature of virality, the opportunities yielded are greater than ever. And then we have to talk about

95
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:06,060
content, because as Vanilla Rice noted, 6ix9ine regularly involves himself in plenty of antisocial

96
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,620
behaviour. In a way, many would say that this is part of the culture. I mean, hip-hop is a true

97
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,020
reflection of what life is like. It's not pretty, but it's something that has to be addressed. But

98
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,460
this is where the conflation of cultural understanding has allowed some fairly

99
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,700
reprehensible human beings to slip through the cracks. In hip-hop, the gritty culture can be

100
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,540
derived as a product of the broken system, and therefore, if someone is convicted of

101
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,020
a felony when young, they may still be able to make music afterwards and turn their life around,

102
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,340
and I think that's a positive thing because often they can talk about it and inspire other people.

103
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,860
Many rappers reflect on their struggle, and I see it in a lot of the best music,

104
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:43,580
especially in 2017. However, from the offset, 6ix9ine doesn't do that. But okay,

105
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,060
he's acting like a provocateur while still making his content. Plenty of rappers have done that in

106
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,620
the past. It's the culture. However, that should not apply to every crime in every situation. And

107
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,260
last time I checked, if inappropriate sexual action with minors is a staple in the hip-hop community,

108
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,180
then I don't really want to know, and I feel a lot of artists would not condone that as

109
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,340
defensible behaviour. It's certainly not what's getting infamous, well I hope not at least.

110
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:10,540
Plenty of musicians can live a public life and still be very outrageous because of the power of

111
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:15,100
the consumer, and often that's what's allowed them to get away with it. In a way, maybe we

112
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:20,220
don't hold musicians to the same esteem as actors, but should we? And can we? Music is much less

113
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,780
under the control of the industry currently, and that's both a good and bad thing. It will lead to

114
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:29,500
a lot more diverse and interesting music, gaining traction over mediums that may not have been

115
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,740
available in the past. I love the thought of that, fuck corporations, fuck the establishment,

116
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:39,020
but it also means that certain people who may not deserve popularity may get it, because popular

117
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,740
demand often may disregard quality of character, and given the huge presence of younger audiences

118
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,500
on streaming sites that don't really care about someone's character, then yes, it's going to

119
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,140
happen. Should we change it? I mean, it's not really down to us, whereas an industry could

120
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,620
exile an actor by not casting him in films that require high budgets anyway, and it's not like

121
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:01,100
the actor could make a film on his own. Any musician can find a good squad and drop a spicy

122
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,060
mixtape, it's elementary really, so you can either take a more open industry with the risk of having

123
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:11,100
bad people make the dollar, or cleansing these people, but nonetheless creating a very hierarchical

124
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,740
system which may create very corporate pop. But right now, we don't have a choice either way.

125
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,300
I mean, the masses have made up their mind, though I certainly don't want someone like 6ix9ine around,

126
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,940
you know I won't be purchasing his music, he's here. But then again, there are a few Chris Brown

127
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:30,940
songs that I like. Is it down to the consumer, or the label, or anyone? Tough questions with no clear

128
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,620
answer. I'd love to hear your thoughts down below though. Big thanks to Vinland Wright again for

129
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,820
appearing, I'll leave his links in the description and the pinned comment, check him out. Until then,

130
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,620
I'm The Wright Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

131
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:55,580
Outro
