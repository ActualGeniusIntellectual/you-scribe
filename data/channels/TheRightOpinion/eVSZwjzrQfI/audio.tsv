0	2280	Let's have a little chat, then, lads.
7280	11260	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,
11260	15900	and music, probably the most volatile industry of recent, and the subject of today's question.
15900	19900	When we talk about recent movements, obviously the first one that comes into our head is Me Too,
19900	24260	which obviously inspired many women to come forward about their sexual maltreatment by celebrities,
24260	28260	primarily in the film and journalism industry, though it did have outreach into other sectors.
28260	33980	Some very large names were taken down, while others very slyly sneaked out of the spotlight during the allegations.
33980	37860	However, there was one industry that was eerily quiet, and that was the music industry,
37860	41320	and now there were a few, Russell Simmons probably being the most famous of all,
41320	45300	but that was more from an executive position, and even then, the coverage has been minimal,
45300	48740	which is surprising considering the claims are quite numerous against him.
48740	52020	For those who are familiar with my channel, you'll know that I'm a keen follower of music.
52020	54780	If I wanted to start up my own review medium, I probably could.
54780	58460	I like to see myself as someone who, quote, gets around 99% of music.
58460	61500	Recently, there's been a trend of what many regard as Soundclown rappers.
61500	67980	Now, this is headed by names like Lil Pump, XXXTentacion, Lil Uzi Vert, Lil Yachty, you know, lots of Lil people.
67980	70700	I bet some of them aren't even small, misleading cunts.
70700	76940	However, obviously rap is typically a more gritty genre, and therefore some of its output is gonna be more controversial.
76940	81660	At the pinnacle of this controversy, one of the Soundclown artists to emerge was 6ix9ine,
81660	86060	or Tekashi 6ix9ine, as some call him, and his music is interesting.
86060	90540	That's an appropriate word to describe it. However, that's not the only interesting thing about him.
90540	93500	To understand the premise of what I'm gonna be talking about today,
93500	98620	and why he's more than just the typical interesting individual, I'm gonna have to get some help in,
98620	103740	because, to be honest, although I know the basics of his case, I don't really know what his persona is like.
103740	108780	So, to understand why he's so controversial, I've decided to bring on Soundclown rap connoisseur,
108780	111660	Vanilla Rice, to explain exactly why he's causing a stir,
111660	115420	following which I will talk about the greater point being made. Take it away.
115420	119820	Hello, everyone, and welcome to my part of the video. I've been asked to talk about Tekashi 6ix9ine.
119820	126140	Now, the thing about Tekashi 6ix9ine is that, to me, personally, I feel like he's set such a bad precedent
126140	131900	for so many internet, or Soundcloud rappers, or up-and-coming artists, and it's just not good.
131900	135340	Tekashi 6ix9ine, so you might have heard of him. You might have heard this song.
135340	141580	Or this song.
145740	146540	Or this song.
153580	158140	Or you might have heard all of them, and thought they were one song. Now, usually, I don't say that.
158140	164380	Usually, I don't say, oh, oh, oh, this rap and all of his songs sound the same. But this, it's genuinely, like,
164380	171740	the same flow, and the same sort of beat, and the same sort of lyrical consistency of all of his other songs,
171740	176620	of all of his hits. I just don't appreciate that. The only reason he's relevant is because he always
176620	181420	maintains a state of controversy, and he's always in the media for doing something controversial,
181420	189100	either touching kids, or shooting a gun, or, uh, saying, oh, test my gangsta. Test it. Test my gangsta.
189100	192220	Test my gangsta. Come test my gangsta, you know what I'm saying?
192220	197500	I want people to test my gangsta. Test my gangsta. The thing I don't like about it is, because he,
197500	203100	like, he still maintains his relevancy. He still maintains it from DJ Akademiks, who covers him,
203100	207180	like, every day of the week, because he's always doing something. Like, the other day, he was shooting
207180	212140	a gun. He was in, like, a gunfight. He was just squaring up to people, because he was, like, because of
212140	217820	his actions, where he goes, test my gangsta. People have now tested his gangsta, and they brought out
217900	223500	guns, and he was, like, because he maintains this sort of drama all the time, and I don't appreciate
223500	230780	it. He hasn't done anything revolutionary. His flow isn't anything, any, like, revolutionary thing.
230780	234540	His lyrical consistency, it's not revolutionary. It's just hype music. It's just because he's got
234540	239180	rainbow hair, that he's sort of stood out, and everyone's gone, oh, yeah, that guy's got rainbow
239180	245980	hair. He might be cool. There's allegations around that he's touched kids, and people support him. I
245980	251180	don't understand. I think I understand why people are drawn to him. It's because he's such a crazy,
251180	256300	weird character, and he's such a, I don't know what I want to say, anti-hero. I don't know.
256300	262140	I don't know what to sort of classify him in. He's just 6'9". He's just insane, and he looks weird.
262140	266540	He's just scary. I don't like him. He's just, what is he? Why has he done that to himself? And the
266540	270780	fact that he's done that to himself just to achieve fame means that, like, you know, he's changed his
270780	275260	appearance. He's like, oh, that. Oh, I'm just expressing myself. I'm just expressing myself.
275260	281020	No, mate. You've done that just so you stand out and you maintain your relevancy on no,
281020	286300	like, merit. It's just on your appearance and your insane personality.
300780	307980	No one cares. Why are we keeping him relevant? If an artist has to maintain
309260	315340	a state of drama, and has to maintain a state of drama to stay relevant, then
318060	323100	why? Why are we giving them the time of day? It's only his appearance and the way he conducts
323100	328780	himself that keeps him relevant. And that's just my opinion on it. And again, it's a bad precedent
328780	333900	for people trying to get up to the top, because kids will be like, you know, the kids that want
333900	338780	to become rappers will be like, oh, 6ix9ine, he did it. Oh, I'm gonna rip my teeth out and,
338780	346060	I don't know, get a Glock and go out on the town and all that stuff. And I just, I don't appreciate
346060	350700	what he's done for hip hop. All right? That's just my opinion. Thank you for letting me on your
350700	356460	channel, James, or The Right Opinion, or whatever. It's been a good one. Please subscribe to me,
356540	362060	or follow me on Twitter, or both, so that would be really appreciative. Thank you. Peace out,
362060	367500	home dogs. Thank you, Vanilla Rice. Go check him out. He makes some spicy content. Now, being the
367500	372460	very gracious gentleman he is, he sent me his part before I wrote this script, so I can actually write
372460	377660	it with that information in mind. Now, to nuance onto Vanilla Rice's point about touching kids,
377660	382060	what he meant by that is that 6ix9ine was actually convicted of use of a child in a sexual
382060	386220	performance. Now listen, I'm not here to discuss the case in too much depth, but if you want my
386220	389980	brief hot take, 6ix9ine is talking out his ass. He's lied about every other detail of the
389980	394460	situation and been called out on it, rightfully so. But one thing that has not been disputed is
394460	398860	that he pled guilty to the following crime, and it's a fairly incriminating description. Now,
398860	403260	in many industries, such a conviction would be career-ending, yet he's one of the few that,
403260	408300	even with such information public, allows him to do what he desires, and still gives him an
408300	412940	opportunity to make a hell of a lot of money. Why, I hear you ask? At the height of one of the
412940	418860	most monumental social movements in recent history, is a person so antithetic to that?
418860	424780	Becoming a mainstream artist. Well firstly, music is a very heavily consumer-based market. A lot of
424780	428940	power to decide what is going to be hit lies with much of the buyer, and as many artists tend to
428940	433420	have a signature style, people tend to base it on the quality of the music rather than the character
433420	437820	of the person making it. Whereas in a film, swapping an individual actor out may not be
437820	441900	too much of a difference, in music the artist is much more central to the final product,
441900	446300	making record labels much more reluctant to drop an artist as they're not as expendable as those
446300	450940	who contribute to other industries. Chris Brown is still notching top 100 hits to this day, and he
450940	455900	continued to score huge singles years after the domestic abuse case, which would have ended many
455900	460300	careers in many various persuasions. This conveniently brings us to our second point.
460300	464220	The music is a much more individual art. People aren't just supporting the music, they're often
464220	468460	supporting the artist. The artist is often at the helm of their creation. If you're an actor and you
468460	472140	want to be in a film, and one of the many executives object to your inclusion, then you're
472140	476380	chucked. Even without a label, you could still make hits. In fact, given the current internet
476380	481100	nature of virality, the opportunities yielded are greater than ever. And then we have to talk about
481100	486060	content, because as Vanilla Rice noted, 6ix9ine regularly involves himself in plenty of antisocial
486060	490620	behaviour. In a way, many would say that this is part of the culture. I mean, hip-hop is a true
490620	495020	reflection of what life is like. It's not pretty, but it's something that has to be addressed. But
495020	498460	this is where the conflation of cultural understanding has allowed some fairly
498460	502700	reprehensible human beings to slip through the cracks. In hip-hop, the gritty culture can be
502700	506540	derived as a product of the broken system, and therefore, if someone is convicted of
506540	511020	a felony when young, they may still be able to make music afterwards and turn their life around,
511020	515340	and I think that's a positive thing because often they can talk about it and inspire other people.
515340	518860	Many rappers reflect on their struggle, and I see it in a lot of the best music,
518860	523580	especially in 2017. However, from the offset, 6ix9ine doesn't do that. But okay,
523580	528060	he's acting like a provocateur while still making his content. Plenty of rappers have done that in
528060	532620	the past. It's the culture. However, that should not apply to every crime in every situation. And
532620	537260	last time I checked, if inappropriate sexual action with minors is a staple in the hip-hop community,
537260	541180	then I don't really want to know, and I feel a lot of artists would not condone that as
541180	545340	defensible behaviour. It's certainly not what's getting infamous, well I hope not at least.
545340	550540	Plenty of musicians can live a public life and still be very outrageous because of the power of
550540	555100	the consumer, and often that's what's allowed them to get away with it. In a way, maybe we
555100	560220	don't hold musicians to the same esteem as actors, but should we? And can we? Music is much less
560220	564780	under the control of the industry currently, and that's both a good and bad thing. It will lead to
564780	569500	a lot more diverse and interesting music, gaining traction over mediums that may not have been
569500	573740	available in the past. I love the thought of that, fuck corporations, fuck the establishment,
573740	579020	but it also means that certain people who may not deserve popularity may get it, because popular
579020	583740	demand often may disregard quality of character, and given the huge presence of younger audiences
583740	587500	on streaming sites that don't really care about someone's character, then yes, it's going to
587500	592140	happen. Should we change it? I mean, it's not really down to us, whereas an industry could
592140	596620	exile an actor by not casting him in films that require high budgets anyway, and it's not like
596620	601100	the actor could make a film on his own. Any musician can find a good squad and drop a spicy
601100	606060	mixtape, it's elementary really, so you can either take a more open industry with the risk of having
606060	611100	bad people make the dollar, or cleansing these people, but nonetheless creating a very hierarchical
611100	615740	system which may create very corporate pop. But right now, we don't have a choice either way.
615740	620300	I mean, the masses have made up their mind, though I certainly don't want someone like 6ix9ine around,
620300	624940	you know I won't be purchasing his music, he's here. But then again, there are a few Chris Brown
624940	630940	songs that I like. Is it down to the consumer, or the label, or anyone? Tough questions with no clear
630940	634620	answer. I'd love to hear your thoughts down below though. Big thanks to Vinland Wright again for
634620	639820	appearing, I'll leave his links in the description and the pinned comment, check him out. Until then,
639820	642620	I'm The Wright Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
642620	655580	Outro
