00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,960
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,600
too much free time, and Philip DeFranco, what a character.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,040
He has one of the platform's veterans for multiple reasons, DeFranco embodies how success

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,320
within YouTube can expand and develop in many unique ways.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,040
The 32 year old has been on the platform for over 10 years now and he has had his fair

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,600
share of prosperity, but there are always two sides of the coin, and when you're in

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,480
his position, the knives are never too far from your throat.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,680
Often my videos will involve talking about a long chain of events, and the chain of events

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,160
that inspired the DeFranco show are too many to detail into one section, however I will

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,760
give a brief overview of his history.

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,400
DeFranco started up his channel while he was still at university in the true entrepreneurial

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,400
spirit.

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,440
The channel at first was called SexyPhil and obviously reflected the highly dignified manner

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,240
that he was going to conduct himself with.

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,240
If you can detect a slight tone of sarcasm within my voice it's because DeFranco wasn't

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,760
exactly the same person 10 years ago than he is today, and one of his earliest successes

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,960
was a video by the name of Big Boobs and You, which as the title described included Big

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,680
Boobs and You, but mostly DeFranco discussing it.

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,400
The intro is a slightly improper disclaimer warning that if you do not enjoy the objectification

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,440
of women, you may not enjoy this video.

21
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,680
I've put it a bit more politely than he did, in all fairness it is pure corn and it is

22
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,600
quite amusing for what it's worth, and one observation that can be made is that an asset

23
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,480
that is identifiably consistent with even his recent content is his on camera charisma,

24
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,280
he still has that grasp with the audience.

25
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,720
Back in the days of yore you could have low production value and still appeal to an audience,

26
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,000
and it is amazing how technology has evolved, the sort of content that DeFranco uploaded

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,040
would be ridiculed in a modern day scenario, but this was 2007 and classics like Big Boobs

28
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,320
and You thrived in that environment.

29
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,580
So taking the heed of its success, DeFranco made this style the centre of appeal within

30
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,540
his channel, not Big Boobs of course, though they weren't excluded by any means, but

31
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,580
he quickly made his videos focused around the discussion of topics that were gonna hit

32
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,580
that appeal.

33
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,140
Basically, Philip DeFranco was one of the earliest pioneers in the clickbait niche,

34
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,340
but unlike his 2000s contemporaries he managed to stick it out as his personality matured

35
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,220
like a fine cheddar, whereas many of those around him became quickly stale.

36
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,100
He managed to stay relevant by keeping ahead of the time, as he grew he paid attention

37
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,940
to the site changing and evolving, and in essence he evolved with it.

38
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,020
He realised that calling people rug munchers probably would not wash with all of his newer

39
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,460
audience, and also understood that you have to branch out to maintain success.

40
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,000
One of the things that a majority of larger YouTubers will tell you is that you shouldn't

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,160
limit your success to merely YouTube, or you quickly become dependent on a platform that

42
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,940
can decide whether it wants you to have a good or bad day.

43
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,620
DeFranco clearly understood this, and has ventured out on many enterprises, including

44
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,460
multiple channels, brand deals, business undertakings, all while maintaining a strong YouTube presence.

45
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:52,740
It's very clear that DeFranco has created a lot of opportunities for himself, but he

46
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,940
still has an underlying fondness for the platform that has enabled his opportunities as he has

47
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,700
continued to upload to this day.

48
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:03,140
In many ways that respect appeared to be reciprocal, YouTube even decided to feature him in the

49
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,980
end of their 2017 rewind, and in spite of the very rocky year for YouTube, that decision

50
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,980
was at least praised.

51
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,220
Love him or hate him, Philip DeFranco has persisted through many generations of YouTube

52
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,540
and has amassed a consistent fanbase, and that is fair.

53
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,500
This brand of news, although not necessarily exceptional within its presentation, manages

54
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,940
to balance the delivery of information with some moderate, if fairly ordinary opinions.

55
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,340
I think the main reason that DeFranco has retained an audience is that element of trust,

56
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,120
unlike a lot of news corporations, he's never presented as having an ulterior agenda.

57
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,620
Sure he has his opinions, and you're gonna agree with some and disagree with others,

58
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,860
but it doesn't seem like he's conveying those opinions for any reason other than the

59
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,520
fact that he likes to express himself, whereas many corporation news channels do seem to

60
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,080
have that slanted take before they even approach the story within that.

61
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,880
DeFranco always takes it from a case by case basis, and through that, he has definitely

62
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,240
carved himself a niche on the YouTube landscape, however in the last year, a fair few developments

63
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,240
have occurred.

64
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,700
Firstly, after a series of partnerships, DeFranco announced that he had retained control of

65
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,360
his assets and was launching the DeFranco Elite, a paid subscription that would fan

66
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,900
fund his content, and he also announced the intention to expand on a network, and although

67
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,920
it's all kinda vague and up in the air, that's the basic premise.

68
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,000
In a way, he wants to become independent, and one can respect that, but the situation

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,340
is greater than that, and DeFranco has uploaded multiple videos, most recently just over a

70
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:26,060
month ago in which he uploaded a video titled Tired, Frustrated, but also Excited, in which

71
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,880
he reflected over the recent wave of demonetisation on his latest content and the views that appear

72
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,080
to have been affected by it.

73
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,240
He has also been highly vocal about this on his Twitter.

74
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,520
And that's what I wanted to discuss today, because the way DeFranco often discusses these

75
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,640
problems can give an audience the perception that this is a generality in the way that

76
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,640
YouTube are behaving.

77
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,920
Whether intentional or not, I don't really think that's the case.

78
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
What do I mean by that?

79
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:55,160
Well, today I open the case of YouTube and how Philip DeFranco became a target.

80
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,140
The thing is, I've made my videos on this budding old platform for a while, and what

81
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:04,040
I know is that although a fair few videos of mine are demonetised, most are not, and

82
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,120
the situation has significantly improved in the last few months.

83
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,800
The algorithm is still fairly useless, but it is better, and that is something that may

84
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,460
be surprising to anyone outside of this.

85
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:18,160
To see someone as reputable as DeFranco being hit does beckon a further question about how

86
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,160
it has happened.

87
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,920
Nonetheless, to really understand the depth of the current situation, we have to get some

88
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,880
history on it, and we have to go back in time, back to 2007 to be precise, to truly understand

89
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,400
the evolution of the YouTube landscape.

90
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,680
So, without further ado, let's get to it.

91
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,040
YouTube was up and running, but it needed some form of income, so in May 2007 they created

92
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,820
the partnership program, which enabled popular creators to monetise their videos with the

93
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,800
inclusion of AdSense units.

94
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,640
However, back then they were particularly selective, and it was individually handed

95
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,840
out, not everyone could get a partnership.

96
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,800
DeFranco amassing a reasonable audience himself was allocated one of these.

97
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,520
To put this into perspective, at this point he stood alongside the likes of Smosh, Nigahiga,

98
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,800
and Fred.

99
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
Quite the clique.

100
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,800
Eventually, as YouTube began to grow in popularity, they realised that they could expand this

101
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,160
and became more and more liberal with how they handed out these monetisation passes.

102
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,120
This on principle doesn't seem like an intrinsically bad idea, however as they soon found out,

103
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,840
it came back to bite them, on the arse.

104
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,240
YouTube continued to grow, and grow, and grow, and eventually fringe groups who would otherwise

105
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,480
not be represented on a platform mainly about entertaining viewership, saw great opportunity

106
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,080
to distribute propaganda, at the same time, YouTube's growth also attracted an interest

107
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,800
of competing media who realised the actual threat that YouTube's current status posed.

108
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,320
These were two independent but coinciding formulas that inevitably led to the media

109
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,280
turning quite viciously on the video sharing platform, and DeFranco himself was obviously

110
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,920
caught up in the fray of this, but what a lot of people tend to forget is that he was

111
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,040
actually caught by YouTube's pre-emptive measures, you know, the ones that absolutely failed

112
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,600
even before YouTube imploded in on itself.

113
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:26,040
In 2016, yes 2016, he uploaded a video titled, YouTube is shutting down my channel and I'm

114
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
not sure what to do.

115
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,520
A video in which he begins by citing concerns on the demonetisation of his previous video,

116
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,040
but as the video progresses, we witness him learning more about the issues surrounding

117
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,440
his channel, and closing with him asking what the plan of action should be.

118
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,400
As of May 2018, that video has attained over 6 million views.

119
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,400
This concern about monetisation has now been extended to a concern about views, in this

120
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,480
video we mentioned earlier how he noted that although monetisation may not be a problem

121
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,960
in itself, he was receiving feedback from viewers that they weren't being notified

122
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,840
of new episodes, particularly prevalent in videos that had been denied ads on appeal.

123
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,080
Now one of the statements that he posed in his original video about demonetisation was

124
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,820
this suggestion that YouTube might be trying to force him off the platform, but why would

125
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,820
they do that?

126
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,600
Why would they try to censor one of their most iconic creators?

127
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,080
Well let's break down the main options.

128
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,800
The first option is probably the most cynical, that YouTube has an agenda and that Philip

129
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,460
DeFranco doesn't align with it, and that they are actively trying to suppress his voice

130
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,640
on the platform, and eventually want to kick him off.

131
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,060
The second option is that due to YouTube rewriting their terms and conditions, DeFranco was caught

132
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,320
by the fallout of such rules and therefore lost monetisation on many of his videos, or

133
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,720
the third which we'll save to later.

134
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,320
Which one is it?

135
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:48,500
Let's try and work it out.

136
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
Option one.

137
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,760
Now it is quite clear that YouTube has an agenda, you go on their channel, and you can

138
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,820
see that they're trying to appeal to that wide-eyed millennial charm that many advertisers

139
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,280
like to see, it's wafer thin and transparent, but you guess it does the job, but is it something

140
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,280
more deeply ingrained?

141
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,920
Well to do that we have to assume that demonetisation is going to hurt DeFranco's voice, how would

142
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
they do that?

143
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,200
Cutting money probably won't make the difference, especially as he now has a separate subscription

144
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,200
service so they must be trying to cut the views and get rid of his representation, but

145
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,300
to do that we'd have to at least be able to imply that there is an algorithm that is

146
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,540
reducing views.

147
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,620
To do that we have YouTuber Nerd City, who revealed some revelations of his own kind,

148
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,720
in his first video uploaded approximately half a year after the original demonetisation

149
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,240
scandal he published information from a researcher known as Cielo, who found a significant difference

150
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,940
in relative views between content that was monetised and content that was demonetised.

151
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,940
However YouTube responded, saying that demonetisation didn't cause the loss in views.

152
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,640
Well well well, everyone for a moment seemed briefly stumped, but lack of causation doesn't

153
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,080
mean there isn't a correlation, and perhaps a third variable that influences both of these

154
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,080
outcomes.

155
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,680
And returning to the drawing board, Cielo published more comprehensive findings that

156
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,040
basically meant that although the monetisation system may have ran independently, there was

157
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,400
a consistent link, this time to a rating system that gave videos rated mature, less views,

158
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,840
and one which advertisers used themselves to discern which videos they wanted to promote

159
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,840
on.

160
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,020
So we've attributed a much more clearer cause, and one that hasn't been disputed.

161
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,880
Now demonetised videos get less views, although the cause of it isn't the demonetisation,

162
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,360
there is a correlation, we can say that demonetised videos are more likely to be rated mature

163
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,440
as well, and thus garner less views, and given the fact that advertisers base their

164
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,520
promotion around the rating system in question, means that obviously there is going to be

165
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,920
a tremendously noticeable link.

166
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,100
So we establish a connection, suppressing monetisation could suppress views, they could

167
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,720
be censoring Philip DeFranco, why would they do that?

168
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,720
Well he certainly doesn't fit the politically correct shield that YouTube often attempt

169
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,520
to push, DeFranco himself is a libertarian, and it shows, in his old content he's an edgy

170
00:10:51,520 --> 00:11:00,400
boy, and is new he still retains a very unique tone, sure it's infinitely more mature,

171
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,040
but if there's one thing that companies don't like, it's individuals who cannot

172
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,640
be externally influenced, and some have credibly hypothesised that DeFranco is just too independent

173
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,520
for the platform, given their recent push for the content that is a lot more focus tested.

174
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:19,000
DeFranco has visibly been unhappy about that, he's been one of the most vocal in calling

175
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,560
them out on a lot of bullshit that's been going on behind the scenes, even if they didn't

176
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,680
hate him before, they sure hate him now.

177
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,840
One of the most notable situations was in the aftermath of the Las Vegas attack, when

178
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,640
Casey Neistat made a video in which he notified users that he created a GoFundMe and also

179
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,340
pledged any adsense from that video, however his video was demonetised and he tweeted to

180
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:43,200
vent his frustration, YouTube responded saying that they have a clear policy on it, fair

181
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,340
enough, not for Phil, in a humiliating moment for YouTube he revealed that they were happily

182
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,560
running advertisements on other content based around the tragedy, in this instance the Jimmy

183
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,760
Kimmel content, they're always pushing into our faces.

184
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,980
The tweet, and the subsequent video he released attracted a ton of publicity, and I guarantee

185
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,980
that DeFranco didn't make many new friends at YouTube headquarters that day, however

186
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,540
if they actually wanted to suppress DeFranco, why haven't they hit him harder?

187
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:11,820
What's important here is the huge surge of young people that tuned in to see the grand jury announcement,

188
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:16,700
and then unfortunately to see the violence that followed afterwards, I've heard many complaints about-

189
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,780
Well it's about the backlash effect, many people have the power to manipulate the world

190
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:25,520
around them, many have the power to manipulate other people or algorithms and so on, however

191
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,220
the moment that those people realise that they are being manipulated they will likely

192
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,520
wholly turn on the manipulator, so if YouTube really did want to usher DeFranco off the

193
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,640
website they'd have to do it by very subtle coercion, as he has extensive influence over

194
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,720
a large audience, he'd likely still make a lot of noise regardless, but they'd have

195
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,060
to make it seem natural enough so other people didn't care or people felt that his complaints

196
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,560
were unjustified.

197
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,100
So we've handed YouTube a means, motive and opportunity, but just because that option

198
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,960
makes sense, doesn't mean it's the only sensible option.

199
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,840
Let's discuss the second option, as I said earlier, back when YouTube were being very

200
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,380
selective with who they partnered with, DeFranco would obviously receive an unconditional pass

201
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,200
because he was part of a very special group of people.

202
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,920
By the time YouTube implemented new guidelines in the end of 2015, the most exclusive set

203
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,680
of creators they had were the Google preferred lineup, and DeFranco was not a part of that.

204
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,720
YouTube's guidelines were quite general, and content that may be about certain events,

205
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,980
particularly ones that involve tragedy, could be demonetised.

206
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,760
Philip DeFranco's style makes him particularly successful to this, when he was a smaller

207
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,320
YouTuber he'd go for very classic clickbait, now he's more reputable, his brand of titling

208
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,440
involves naming each and every story that he includes, and works in a way of enticing

209
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,440
the viewer in.

210
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,560
Having multiple stories should hit multiple demographics right, but it also makes it incredibly

211
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,380
easy for YouTube to exactly explain why they may not like a topic or a video, and may find

212
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,520
it ineligible for monetisation.

213
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,800
Many of you will know my channel has covered political topics in the past, and although

214
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,880
they've sometimes been sensitive, an overwhelming amount of them have not been demonetised.

215
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,880
This may surprise some of you to know, but it is true, with Philip DeFranco though, three

216
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,580
of his four topics in a video may be perfectly suitable for monetisation, however all it

217
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:10,240
takes is one topic to be inappropriate, and the other topics are taken out too, that is

218
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,480
the problem when you try to kill a few birds with one stone.

219
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,040
So it's possible that Philip DeFranco has not been specifically targeted, but it is

220
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,560
just one of the many who have been demonetised due to the new indiscriminate guidelines,

221
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,040
and those who haven't been affected, well it's just different rules for them.

222
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,560
DeFranco isn't individually being targeted, he's just not in the in-group, and he's

223
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,560
been one of the hardest impacted because of the style of his videos that encompass certain

224
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,280
sensitive topics, and it's clear that YouTube still have no clue what they're really doing.

225
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,560
The general demonetisation approach however, lies on the assumption that the topics covered

226
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,300
are actually being demonetised on other channels as well, for example Philip DeFranco covers

227
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:52,200
a bullying incident and it gets demonetised as part of the greater video, and it would

228
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,620
obviously make sense if other videos on the topic were being demonetised too.

229
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,040
I do not know that I cannot confirm that, you'd probably have to actually carry out

230
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,480
research into whether there is an exceptionalism occurring, people who talk about a wide range

231
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,440
of slightly more serious topics have often found themselves demonetised, another example

232
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,440
of that is the Rubin report, because they cover so much there's going to be something

233
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,840
that hits a soft spot, even though they may cover it in a completely respectful manner,

234
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,120
and Philip DeFranco, a man who would check this for himself, must understand that this

235
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,280
is the scenario right?

236
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,400
But this is where I bring in the third option, because although I'm not an avid viewer

237
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,680
of the DeFranco show, I had to watch a fair few of his videos to familiarise myself with

238
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,600
his content, and one thing that really stood out to me was how moderate he is.

239
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,600
Even if he did cover more sensitive topics, he often handled it with a nuance that I can

240
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,640
see being completely open to support from YouTube and monetisation, like many of the

241
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,520
Daily Show hosts they shove in our face, the only thing that differentiates DeFranco from

242
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,600
these characters is the fact that he's based on YouTube and talks about their problems

243
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
a bit.

244
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,060
YouTube mates, there's nothing wrong with a bit of self reflection.

245
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,280
So for me it comes down to this, YouTube implemented new guidelines, now they most likely were

246
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:03,520
not directly targeting DeFranco and his content, but he was hit with a few other creators who

247
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,880
have been covered under this general sweep of recent.

248
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,860
However, when presented with this scenario, DeFranco went straight for the jugular, publishing

249
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,400
a 6 million plus view video, and after a long line of incidents, it seems that although

250
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,640
YouTube may not have the intent to make his situation worse, it's clear that they're not

251
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,920
necessarily interested in helping him becoming exempt to these predicaments.

252
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,960
To put it gently, the algorithms that they've created kinda suck, because it judges on topic

253
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,580
alone rather than what the actual message is or how it's articulated.

254
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:36,420
I'll point you in the direction again of Nerd City's video for this, that there are situations

255
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,760
in which the bot isn't able to distinguish between a video telling you about why you

256
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,160
shouldn't commit suicide, and content such as the Logan Paul Forest Adventure.

257
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,640
That does not make sense.

258
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:51,120
Philip DeFranco epitomises the sort of collateral damage of YouTube's new algorithm, advertisers

259
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,580
put their content on plenty of TV news channels, and DeFranco's content is basically that but

260
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,580
a bit more profane.

261
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,360
And let's face it, who gives a fuck about swearing?

262
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,660
Sure it's on a spectrum, but most videos, even videos on Google Preferred, have explicit

263
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,660
language included.

264
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:09,800
Essentially, it's the topics that get DeFranco, and it's the easy option for YouTube.

265
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
But is it the right one?

266
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,880
Often when having this discussion, there'll normally be one person who points out that

267
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,000
it's YouTube's platform and therefore it is their prerogative to do what they want.

268
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,640
And they are completely right.

269
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,020
That's not the discussion that I'm trying to have today.

270
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,800
To summarise, just because they can do it, doesn't mean they should do it.

271
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,740
Given the sheer authority that YouTube has over the competition, it would be ideal if

272
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,840
they could remain unbiased, and also look out for some of their own creators who actually

273
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,760
make decent productive content.

274
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,480
I think people are becoming increasingly sick of the celebrities they try to ship in each

275
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,880
month, it seems tired and frustrating.

276
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,580
Not because people hate celebrities, but because they don't lean on YouTube the same way that

277
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,560
people like DeFranco have in the past.

278
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,720
What makes so many stories inspiring about YouTube is that you, the ordinary person,

279
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,000
can express your creativity, and people can actually support it in a creative way.

280
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,040
You don't need any huge corporate investment, you just need a bit of intuition and a half

281
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,720
decent microphone, and camera in some instances.

282
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,720
This spans over a wide range of topics, current affairs included.

283
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,400
The thing is, suppressing the actual sensible takes on often complex topics, and yet allowing

284
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,640
the other corporations to populate the site is a risky business, because they can survive

285
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,080
without the site, and they have survived without the site, and then YouTube just becomes another

286
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,720
funnel for mainstream media.

287
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,800
And yes, people like DeFranco will obviously persist regardless of these circumstances,

288
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,760
but he will not live forever, and eventually people will look towards new creators to try

289
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,500
and fill the gap for the recent takes on these topics.

290
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,400
The current algorithms that YouTube appear to have created do not benefit that, and that

291
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,560
is a great shame.

292
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,660
My main concern is that through that, you create a culture of two-times creators.

293
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,480
People who don't really focus on delivering the news, but more on creating a highly committed

294
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,300
cult following that will sustain them, and the other side being the corporate-sponsored

295
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,900
number-driven media who equally don't care on delivering news, and I do not like that

296
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,900
prospect.

297
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,800
I think the likes of CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, etc. are shit.

298
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,760
I can't stand how they all go into their content with such a thinly veiled pre-aligned

299
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,760
agenda.

300
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,760
And you know what?

301
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,080
I can say that because it's my fucking opinion, and that's what people want to hear.

302
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,320
When you watch these news channels, it often feels like you're not hearing that opinion,

303
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,920
and more what they think will make people tune in.

304
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,560
Gaining respect from being reasonable is such a gradual process because it doesn't rely

305
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,720
on those immediate emotional reactions that may be elicited from the audience in light

306
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,720
of events.

307
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,960
It relies on actual rationality, reflection, and consideration.

308
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,680
However, once that reasonability becomes a trusted source, it can genuinely aid how people

309
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,660
respond to crises in the future.

310
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,660
That's why I think DeFranco's brand of commentary, whether entirely earnest or not, is still

311
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,840
an important one.

312
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,560
People tend to say that his complaints come across as self-centred and egocentric, and

313
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,360
I think that is a justified critique when rewatching the videos some of his statements

314
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,400
can come across as a bit awkward.

315
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,500
But whether his motivations are focused around his own interests or not, his complaints still

316
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:01,160
have an applicability that I personally believe to be beneficial to creator well-being.

317
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,500
So I guess the real integrity test will be if he does choose to leave the site, how only

318
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,840
he will continue to report on such issues affecting creators.

319
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,060
Of course, I do not believe he will leave the site, regardless of the network he creates,

320
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:17,500
YouTube is so front and centre that it would take a monumental shift to steal even a fraction

321
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,160
of the power away from them.

322
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,220
The truth is, as the site expands in its grasp and develops further, the opportunities for

323
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,740
new creators will typically pivot, doors will open and doors will close.

324
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,800
But we don't want any of those doors to be fully locked, nor do we want certain doors

325
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,620
to only be open to very few people, people with less than amiable intentions at that.

326
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:40,220
We want people to still have a chance, especially if that chance involves discussing topics

327
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,660
in an actually reasonable and sensible way.

328
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,820
Even now, we do not have enough of that.

329
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:49,460
I can't look in Philip DeFranco's mind and completely read his intentions, but the content

330
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,220
that he puts out in the context of modern media is quite refreshing, and whether the

331
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,660
reasons for YouTube preventing it from reaching his audience are justified or not, it would

332
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:02,100
be a great shame to lose that, either from him or from the future videos that may appear

333
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,100
down the road.

334
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,880
I believe that YouTube has great opportunity to platform people with really interesting

335
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,140
ideas and I hope they don't shelve that model because they're afraid of tackling

336
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,440
proper discussion, which although sometimes hard, is highly important.

337
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,700
Don't sell that off to corporations who have one singular agenda, news for views.

338
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,140
And as for audiences that are in question today, just stay aware, keep track of your

339
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,540
favourite creators, especially if they appear to be in the scope of the YouTube algorithms.

340
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:30,580
Even if DeFranco plugging in the rest of his social media seems slightly obnoxious, it's

341
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,300
not completely without meaning or merit.

342
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,620
And although DeFranco isn't someone who I am particularly concerned about, he's pretty

343
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,500
much set both on and off the platform, I would still like to see the cream rising to the

344
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,940
top if you know what I mean.

345
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,900
To the creators who want to cover these topics, the craft is still there, it just might require

346
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,800
a bit more elbow grease than was known to the genre before.

347
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,800
The ideas that we speak about today are not meant to extinguish hope within the creators,

348
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,060
but it should spur us to pay attention to something that DeFranco embodies, the grassroots

349
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,400
creator who does not conform to YouTube's current guidelines.

350
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,360
And you can call him entitled, you can call him spoiled, you can call his complaints unnecessary

351
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,760
because of his success, but there are still greater implications, and sometimes it's

352
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,560
important to disconnect the argument from the proponent, because regardless of the person

353
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,420
espousing it, it could just as well apply to you.

354
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,480
Never forget that.

355
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,840
So to summarise, DeFranco is a target, however I highly doubt it's anything particularly

356
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,780
personal, although YouTube have an agenda, it's clear they're not hellbent on silencing

357
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,980
other people, although the fact that DeFranco has been very vocally critical of them probably

358
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,800
hasn't alleviated his turbulent relationship.

359
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,480
Nonetheless that does not mean we shouldn't be concerned because it does mean that they're

360
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,540
going after a genre of content, and they could really stifle the rise of future creators

361
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,840
within that, and given that having rational voices in a world of reactionaries is more

362
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,640
relevant than ever, I think it's an asset worth defending on YouTube.

363
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
Just my opinion.

364
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,220
Anyhow, what are your thoughts on the topic?

365
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,000
What are your thoughts on Philip DeFranco?

366
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,060
Should he be concerned?

367
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,060
Should we be concerned?

368
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,760
I would love to hear down below.

369
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,180
Wanna give a big thanks to the editors who have done another stellar job on the edit,

370
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:04,000
and I will leave all their links in the description below and the pinned comment, make sure to

371
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,640
check them out if you have the time, some of them do remake some great content.

372
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,920
Also if you wanna talk you can reach me on Twitter, you can reach me on Facebook, I'm

373
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,520
trying to be more active in my Discord, though I have been very busy recently, and voice

374
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,520
chat tends to drain a lot of my time.

375
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,680
Not sure there's too much else to say, hope everyone's having a good day, and I hope to

376
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,680
see you again on this channel.

377
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,400
Until then however, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
