0	8960	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
8960	12600	too much free time, and Philip DeFranco, what a character.
12600	17040	He has one of the platform's veterans for multiple reasons, DeFranco embodies how success
17040	20320	within YouTube can expand and develop in many unique ways.
20320	24040	The 32 year old has been on the platform for over 10 years now and he has had his fair
24040	27600	share of prosperity, but there are always two sides of the coin, and when you're in
27600	30480	his position, the knives are never too far from your throat.
30480	34680	Often my videos will involve talking about a long chain of events, and the chain of events
34680	39160	that inspired the DeFranco show are too many to detail into one section, however I will
39160	41760	give a brief overview of his history.
41760	45400	DeFranco started up his channel while he was still at university in the true entrepreneurial
45400	46400	spirit.
46400	50440	The channel at first was called SexyPhil and obviously reflected the highly dignified manner
50440	52240	that he was going to conduct himself with.
52240	56240	If you can detect a slight tone of sarcasm within my voice it's because DeFranco wasn't
56240	60760	exactly the same person 10 years ago than he is today, and one of his earliest successes
60760	65960	was a video by the name of Big Boobs and You, which as the title described included Big
65960	69680	Boobs and You, but mostly DeFranco discussing it.
69680	74400	The intro is a slightly improper disclaimer warning that if you do not enjoy the objectification
74400	76440	of women, you may not enjoy this video.
76440	80680	I've put it a bit more politely than he did, in all fairness it is pure corn and it is
80680	84600	quite amusing for what it's worth, and one observation that can be made is that an asset
84600	89480	that is identifiably consistent with even his recent content is his on camera charisma,
89480	92280	he still has that grasp with the audience.
92280	96720	Back in the days of yore you could have low production value and still appeal to an audience,
96720	101000	and it is amazing how technology has evolved, the sort of content that DeFranco uploaded
101000	106040	would be ridiculed in a modern day scenario, but this was 2007 and classics like Big Boobs
106040	108320	and You thrived in that environment.
108320	112580	So taking the heed of its success, DeFranco made this style the centre of appeal within
112580	116540	his channel, not Big Boobs of course, though they weren't excluded by any means, but
116540	120580	he quickly made his videos focused around the discussion of topics that were gonna hit
120580	121580	that appeal.
121580	125140	Basically, Philip DeFranco was one of the earliest pioneers in the clickbait niche,
125140	129340	but unlike his 2000s contemporaries he managed to stick it out as his personality matured
129340	133220	like a fine cheddar, whereas many of those around him became quickly stale.
133220	137100	He managed to stay relevant by keeping ahead of the time, as he grew he paid attention
137100	140940	to the site changing and evolving, and in essence he evolved with it.
140940	145020	He realised that calling people rug munchers probably would not wash with all of his newer
145020	149460	audience, and also understood that you have to branch out to maintain success.
149460	153000	One of the things that a majority of larger YouTubers will tell you is that you shouldn't
153000	157160	limit your success to merely YouTube, or you quickly become dependent on a platform that
157160	159940	can decide whether it wants you to have a good or bad day.
159940	163620	DeFranco clearly understood this, and has ventured out on many enterprises, including
163620	168460	multiple channels, brand deals, business undertakings, all while maintaining a strong YouTube presence.
168740	172740	It's very clear that DeFranco has created a lot of opportunities for himself, but he
172740	176940	still has an underlying fondness for the platform that has enabled his opportunities as he has
176940	178700	continued to upload to this day.
178700	183140	In many ways that respect appeared to be reciprocal, YouTube even decided to feature him in the
183140	188980	end of their 2017 rewind, and in spite of the very rocky year for YouTube, that decision
188980	189980	was at least praised.
189980	194220	Love him or hate him, Philip DeFranco has persisted through many generations of YouTube
194220	197540	and has amassed a consistent fanbase, and that is fair.
197540	201500	This brand of news, although not necessarily exceptional within its presentation, manages
201500	205940	to balance the delivery of information with some moderate, if fairly ordinary opinions.
205940	210340	I think the main reason that DeFranco has retained an audience is that element of trust,
210340	215120	unlike a lot of news corporations, he's never presented as having an ulterior agenda.
215120	218620	Sure he has his opinions, and you're gonna agree with some and disagree with others,
218620	221860	but it doesn't seem like he's conveying those opinions for any reason other than the
221860	225520	fact that he likes to express himself, whereas many corporation news channels do seem to
225520	229080	have that slanted take before they even approach the story within that.
229080	232880	DeFranco always takes it from a case by case basis, and through that, he has definitely
232880	237240	carved himself a niche on the YouTube landscape, however in the last year, a fair few developments
237240	238240	have occurred.
238240	241700	Firstly, after a series of partnerships, DeFranco announced that he had retained control of
241700	245360	his assets and was launching the DeFranco Elite, a paid subscription that would fan
245360	249900	fund his content, and he also announced the intention to expand on a network, and although
249900	252920	it's all kinda vague and up in the air, that's the basic premise.
252920	257000	In a way, he wants to become independent, and one can respect that, but the situation
257000	261340	is greater than that, and DeFranco has uploaded multiple videos, most recently just over a
261340	266060	month ago in which he uploaded a video titled Tired, Frustrated, but also Excited, in which
266060	270880	he reflected over the recent wave of demonetisation on his latest content and the views that appear
270880	272080	to have been affected by it.
272080	275240	He has also been highly vocal about this on his Twitter.
275240	278520	And that's what I wanted to discuss today, because the way DeFranco often discusses these
278520	282640	problems can give an audience the perception that this is a generality in the way that
282640	283640	YouTube are behaving.
283640	286920	Whether intentional or not, I don't really think that's the case.
286920	287920	What do I mean by that?
287920	295160	Well, today I open the case of YouTube and how Philip DeFranco became a target.
295160	299140	The thing is, I've made my videos on this budding old platform for a while, and what
299140	304040	I know is that although a fair few videos of mine are demonetised, most are not, and
304040	307120	the situation has significantly improved in the last few months.
307120	310800	The algorithm is still fairly useless, but it is better, and that is something that may
310800	313460	be surprising to anyone outside of this.
313460	318160	To see someone as reputable as DeFranco being hit does beckon a further question about how
318160	319160	it has happened.
319160	322920	Nonetheless, to really understand the depth of the current situation, we have to get some
322920	327880	history on it, and we have to go back in time, back to 2007 to be precise, to truly understand
327880	330400	the evolution of the YouTube landscape.
330680	332680	So, without further ado, let's get to it.
344680	349040	YouTube was up and running, but it needed some form of income, so in May 2007 they created
349040	352820	the partnership program, which enabled popular creators to monetise their videos with the
352820	354800	inclusion of AdSense units.
354800	358640	However, back then they were particularly selective, and it was individually handed
358640	360840	out, not everyone could get a partnership.
364280	367800	DeFranco amassing a reasonable audience himself was allocated one of these.
367800	372520	To put this into perspective, at this point he stood alongside the likes of Smosh, Nigahiga,
372520	373800	and Fred.
373800	374800	Quite the clique.
374800	378800	Eventually, as YouTube began to grow in popularity, they realised that they could expand this
378800	383160	and became more and more liberal with how they handed out these monetisation passes.
383160	388120	This on principle doesn't seem like an intrinsically bad idea, however as they soon found out,
388120	391840	it came back to bite them, on the arse.
391840	397240	YouTube continued to grow, and grow, and grow, and eventually fringe groups who would otherwise
397240	401480	not be represented on a platform mainly about entertaining viewership, saw great opportunity
401480	406080	to distribute propaganda, at the same time, YouTube's growth also attracted an interest
406080	410800	of competing media who realised the actual threat that YouTube's current status posed.
410800	414320	These were two independent but coinciding formulas that inevitably led to the media
414320	418280	turning quite viciously on the video sharing platform, and DeFranco himself was obviously
418280	421920	caught up in the fray of this, but what a lot of people tend to forget is that he was
421920	426040	actually caught by YouTube's pre-emptive measures, you know, the ones that absolutely failed
426040	428600	even before YouTube imploded in on itself.
428600	446040	In 2016, yes 2016, he uploaded a video titled, YouTube is shutting down my channel and I'm
446040	447040	not sure what to do.
447040	451520	A video in which he begins by citing concerns on the demonetisation of his previous video,
451520	455040	but as the video progresses, we witness him learning more about the issues surrounding
455040	458440	his channel, and closing with him asking what the plan of action should be.
458440	463400	As of May 2018, that video has attained over 6 million views.
463400	467400	This concern about monetisation has now been extended to a concern about views, in this
467400	471480	video we mentioned earlier how he noted that although monetisation may not be a problem
471480	474960	in itself, he was receiving feedback from viewers that they weren't being notified
474960	479840	of new episodes, particularly prevalent in videos that had been denied ads on appeal.
479840	483080	Now one of the statements that he posed in his original video about demonetisation was
483080	486820	this suggestion that YouTube might be trying to force him off the platform, but why would
486820	487820	they do that?
487820	490600	Why would they try to censor one of their most iconic creators?
490600	492080	Well let's break down the main options.
492080	495800	The first option is probably the most cynical, that YouTube has an agenda and that Philip
495800	499460	DeFranco doesn't align with it, and that they are actively trying to suppress his voice
499460	503640	on the platform, and eventually want to kick him off.
503640	508060	The second option is that due to YouTube rewriting their terms and conditions, DeFranco was caught
508060	512320	by the fallout of such rules and therefore lost monetisation on many of his videos, or
512320	514720	the third which we'll save to later.
514720	516320	Which one is it?
516320	528500	Let's try and work it out.
528500	529500	Option one.
529500	532760	Now it is quite clear that YouTube has an agenda, you go on their channel, and you can
532760	536820	see that they're trying to appeal to that wide-eyed millennial charm that many advertisers
536820	541280	like to see, it's wafer thin and transparent, but you guess it does the job, but is it something
541280	542280	more deeply ingrained?
542280	546920	Well to do that we have to assume that demonetisation is going to hurt DeFranco's voice, how would
546920	547920	they do that?
547920	552200	Cutting money probably won't make the difference, especially as he now has a separate subscription
552200	556200	service so they must be trying to cut the views and get rid of his representation, but
556200	560300	to do that we'd have to at least be able to imply that there is an algorithm that is
560300	561540	reducing views.
561540	565620	To do that we have YouTuber Nerd City, who revealed some revelations of his own kind,
565620	569720	in his first video uploaded approximately half a year after the original demonetisation
569720	574240	scandal he published information from a researcher known as Cielo, who found a significant difference
574240	578940	in relative views between content that was monetised and content that was demonetised.
578940	582940	However YouTube responded, saying that demonetisation didn't cause the loss in views.
582940	587640	Well well well, everyone for a moment seemed briefly stumped, but lack of causation doesn't
587640	592080	mean there isn't a correlation, and perhaps a third variable that influences both of these
592080	593080	outcomes.
593080	596680	And returning to the drawing board, Cielo published more comprehensive findings that
596680	601040	basically meant that although the monetisation system may have ran independently, there was
601040	606400	a consistent link, this time to a rating system that gave videos rated mature, less views,
606400	610840	and one which advertisers used themselves to discern which videos they wanted to promote
610840	611840	on.
611840	616020	So we've attributed a much more clearer cause, and one that hasn't been disputed.
616020	620880	Now demonetised videos get less views, although the cause of it isn't the demonetisation,
620880	625360	there is a correlation, we can say that demonetised videos are more likely to be rated mature
625360	629440	as well, and thus garner less views, and given the fact that advertisers base their
629440	633520	promotion around the rating system in question, means that obviously there is going to be
633520	635920	a tremendously noticeable link.
635920	640100	So we establish a connection, suppressing monetisation could suppress views, they could
640100	642720	be censoring Philip DeFranco, why would they do that?
642720	646720	Well he certainly doesn't fit the politically correct shield that YouTube often attempt
646720	651520	to push, DeFranco himself is a libertarian, and it shows, in his old content he's an edgy
651520	660400	boy, and is new he still retains a very unique tone, sure it's infinitely more mature,
660400	664040	but if there's one thing that companies don't like, it's individuals who cannot
664040	669640	be externally influenced, and some have credibly hypothesised that DeFranco is just too independent
669640	674520	for the platform, given their recent push for the content that is a lot more focus tested.
674520	679000	DeFranco has visibly been unhappy about that, he's been one of the most vocal in calling
679000	682560	them out on a lot of bullshit that's been going on behind the scenes, even if they didn't
682560	684680	hate him before, they sure hate him now.
684680	688840	One of the most notable situations was in the aftermath of the Las Vegas attack, when
688840	693640	Casey Neistat made a video in which he notified users that he created a GoFundMe and also
693640	698340	pledged any adsense from that video, however his video was demonetised and he tweeted to
698340	703200	vent his frustration, YouTube responded saying that they have a clear policy on it, fair
703200	707340	enough, not for Phil, in a humiliating moment for YouTube he revealed that they were happily
707340	711560	running advertisements on other content based around the tragedy, in this instance the Jimmy
711560	714760	Kimmel content, they're always pushing into our faces.
714760	718980	The tweet, and the subsequent video he released attracted a ton of publicity, and I guarantee
718980	722980	that DeFranco didn't make many new friends at YouTube headquarters that day, however
722980	726540	if they actually wanted to suppress DeFranco, why haven't they hit him harder?
726540	731820	What's important here is the huge surge of young people that tuned in to see the grand jury announcement,
731820	736700	and then unfortunately to see the violence that followed afterwards, I've heard many complaints about-
736700	740780	Well it's about the backlash effect, many people have the power to manipulate the world
740780	745520	around them, many have the power to manipulate other people or algorithms and so on, however
745520	749220	the moment that those people realise that they are being manipulated they will likely
749220	753520	wholly turn on the manipulator, so if YouTube really did want to usher DeFranco off the
753520	758640	website they'd have to do it by very subtle coercion, as he has extensive influence over
758640	762720	a large audience, he'd likely still make a lot of noise regardless, but they'd have
762720	767060	to make it seem natural enough so other people didn't care or people felt that his complaints
767060	768560	were unjustified.
768560	773100	So we've handed YouTube a means, motive and opportunity, but just because that option
773100	775960	makes sense, doesn't mean it's the only sensible option.
775960	779840	Let's discuss the second option, as I said earlier, back when YouTube were being very
779840	784380	selective with who they partnered with, DeFranco would obviously receive an unconditional pass
784380	787200	because he was part of a very special group of people.
787200	791920	By the time YouTube implemented new guidelines in the end of 2015, the most exclusive set
791920	796680	of creators they had were the Google preferred lineup, and DeFranco was not a part of that.
796680	800720	YouTube's guidelines were quite general, and content that may be about certain events,
800720	803980	particularly ones that involve tragedy, could be demonetised.
803980	807760	Philip DeFranco's style makes him particularly successful to this, when he was a smaller
807760	812320	YouTuber he'd go for very classic clickbait, now he's more reputable, his brand of titling
812320	816440	involves naming each and every story that he includes, and works in a way of enticing
816440	817440	the viewer in.
817440	821560	Having multiple stories should hit multiple demographics right, but it also makes it incredibly
821560	826380	easy for YouTube to exactly explain why they may not like a topic or a video, and may find
826380	828520	it ineligible for monetisation.
828520	831800	Many of you will know my channel has covered political topics in the past, and although
831800	836880	they've sometimes been sensitive, an overwhelming amount of them have not been demonetised.
836880	840880	This may surprise some of you to know, but it is true, with Philip DeFranco though, three
840880	845580	of his four topics in a video may be perfectly suitable for monetisation, however all it
845580	850240	takes is one topic to be inappropriate, and the other topics are taken out too, that is
850240	853480	the problem when you try to kill a few birds with one stone.
853480	857040	So it's possible that Philip DeFranco has not been specifically targeted, but it is
857040	861560	just one of the many who have been demonetised due to the new indiscriminate guidelines,
861560	865040	and those who haven't been affected, well it's just different rules for them.
865040	869560	DeFranco isn't individually being targeted, he's just not in the in-group, and he's
869560	873560	been one of the hardest impacted because of the style of his videos that encompass certain
873560	878280	sensitive topics, and it's clear that YouTube still have no clue what they're really doing.
878280	882560	The general demonetisation approach however, lies on the assumption that the topics covered
882560	887300	are actually being demonetised on other channels as well, for example Philip DeFranco covers
887300	892200	a bullying incident and it gets demonetised as part of the greater video, and it would
892200	896620	obviously make sense if other videos on the topic were being demonetised too.
896620	900040	I do not know that I cannot confirm that, you'd probably have to actually carry out
900040	904480	research into whether there is an exceptionalism occurring, people who talk about a wide range
904480	908440	of slightly more serious topics have often found themselves demonetised, another example
908440	911440	of that is the Rubin report, because they cover so much there's going to be something
911440	915840	that hits a soft spot, even though they may cover it in a completely respectful manner,
915840	919120	and Philip DeFranco, a man who would check this for himself, must understand that this
919120	920280	is the scenario right?
920600	924400	But this is where I bring in the third option, because although I'm not an avid viewer
924400	928680	of the DeFranco show, I had to watch a fair few of his videos to familiarise myself with
928680	932600	his content, and one thing that really stood out to me was how moderate he is.
934760	938600	Even if he did cover more sensitive topics, he often handled it with a nuance that I can
938600	942640	see being completely open to support from YouTube and monetisation, like many of the
942640	946520	Daily Show hosts they shove in our face, the only thing that differentiates DeFranco from
946520	950600	these characters is the fact that he's based on YouTube and talks about their problems
950600	951600	a bit.
951600	954060	YouTube mates, there's nothing wrong with a bit of self reflection.
954060	958280	So for me it comes down to this, YouTube implemented new guidelines, now they most likely were
958280	963520	not directly targeting DeFranco and his content, but he was hit with a few other creators who
963520	966880	have been covered under this general sweep of recent.
966880	970860	However, when presented with this scenario, DeFranco went straight for the jugular, publishing
970860	975400	a 6 million plus view video, and after a long line of incidents, it seems that although
975440	979640	YouTube may not have the intent to make his situation worse, it's clear that they're not
979640	983920	necessarily interested in helping him becoming exempt to these predicaments.
983920	988960	To put it gently, the algorithms that they've created kinda suck, because it judges on topic
988960	992580	alone rather than what the actual message is or how it's articulated.
992580	996420	I'll point you in the direction again of Nerd City's video for this, that there are situations
996420	999760	in which the bot isn't able to distinguish between a video telling you about why you
999760	1004160	shouldn't commit suicide, and content such as the Logan Paul Forest Adventure.
1004160	1005640	That does not make sense.
1005640	1011120	Philip DeFranco epitomises the sort of collateral damage of YouTube's new algorithm, advertisers
1011120	1015580	put their content on plenty of TV news channels, and DeFranco's content is basically that but
1015580	1016580	a bit more profane.
1016580	1019360	And let's face it, who gives a fuck about swearing?
1019360	1023660	Sure it's on a spectrum, but most videos, even videos on Google Preferred, have explicit
1023660	1024660	language included.
1024660	1029800	Essentially, it's the topics that get DeFranco, and it's the easy option for YouTube.
1029800	1030800	But is it the right one?
1034800	1037880	Often when having this discussion, there'll normally be one person who points out that
1037880	1042000	it's YouTube's platform and therefore it is their prerogative to do what they want.
1042000	1043640	And they are completely right.
1043640	1046020	That's not the discussion that I'm trying to have today.
1046020	1049800	To summarise, just because they can do it, doesn't mean they should do it.
1049800	1053740	Given the sheer authority that YouTube has over the competition, it would be ideal if
1053740	1057840	they could remain unbiased, and also look out for some of their own creators who actually
1057840	1059760	make decent productive content.
1059760	1063480	I think people are becoming increasingly sick of the celebrities they try to ship in each
1063480	1065880	month, it seems tired and frustrating.
1065880	1069580	Not because people hate celebrities, but because they don't lean on YouTube the same way that
1069580	1071560	people like DeFranco have in the past.
1071560	1075720	What makes so many stories inspiring about YouTube is that you, the ordinary person,
1075720	1080000	can express your creativity, and people can actually support it in a creative way.
1080000	1084040	You don't need any huge corporate investment, you just need a bit of intuition and a half
1084040	1086720	decent microphone, and camera in some instances.
1086720	1090720	This spans over a wide range of topics, current affairs included.
1090720	1095400	The thing is, suppressing the actual sensible takes on often complex topics, and yet allowing
1095400	1099640	the other corporations to populate the site is a risky business, because they can survive
1099640	1104080	without the site, and they have survived without the site, and then YouTube just becomes another
1104080	1105720	funnel for mainstream media.
1105720	1109800	And yes, people like DeFranco will obviously persist regardless of these circumstances,
1109800	1113760	but he will not live forever, and eventually people will look towards new creators to try
1113760	1116500	and fill the gap for the recent takes on these topics.
1116500	1120400	The current algorithms that YouTube appear to have created do not benefit that, and that
1120400	1121560	is a great shame.
1121560	1125660	My main concern is that through that, you create a culture of two-times creators.
1125660	1129480	People who don't really focus on delivering the news, but more on creating a highly committed
1129480	1133300	cult following that will sustain them, and the other side being the corporate-sponsored
1133300	1137900	number-driven media who equally don't care on delivering news, and I do not like that
1137900	1138900	prospect.
1138900	1142800	I think the likes of CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, etc. are shit.
1142800	1146760	I can't stand how they all go into their content with such a thinly veiled pre-aligned
1146760	1147760	agenda.
1147760	1148760	And you know what?
1148760	1152080	I can say that because it's my fucking opinion, and that's what people want to hear.
1152080	1155320	When you watch these news channels, it often feels like you're not hearing that opinion,
1155320	1157920	and more what they think will make people tune in.
1157920	1162560	Gaining respect from being reasonable is such a gradual process because it doesn't rely
1162560	1166720	on those immediate emotional reactions that may be elicited from the audience in light
1166720	1167720	of events.
1167720	1170960	It relies on actual rationality, reflection, and consideration.
1171120	1175680	However, once that reasonability becomes a trusted source, it can genuinely aid how people
1175680	1177660	respond to crises in the future.
1177660	1181660	That's why I think DeFranco's brand of commentary, whether entirely earnest or not, is still
1181660	1182840	an important one.
1182840	1186560	People tend to say that his complaints come across as self-centred and egocentric, and
1186560	1190360	I think that is a justified critique when rewatching the videos some of his statements
1190360	1192400	can come across as a bit awkward.
1192400	1196500	But whether his motivations are focused around his own interests or not, his complaints still
1196500	1201160	have an applicability that I personally believe to be beneficial to creator well-being.
1201160	1205500	So I guess the real integrity test will be if he does choose to leave the site, how only
1205500	1208840	he will continue to report on such issues affecting creators.
1208840	1213060	Of course, I do not believe he will leave the site, regardless of the network he creates,
1213060	1217500	YouTube is so front and centre that it would take a monumental shift to steal even a fraction
1217500	1219160	of the power away from them.
1219160	1223220	The truth is, as the site expands in its grasp and develops further, the opportunities for
1223220	1226740	new creators will typically pivot, doors will open and doors will close.
1226740	1230800	But we don't want any of those doors to be fully locked, nor do we want certain doors
1230800	1235620	to only be open to very few people, people with less than amiable intentions at that.
1235620	1240220	We want people to still have a chance, especially if that chance involves discussing topics
1240220	1242660	in an actually reasonable and sensible way.
1242660	1244820	Even now, we do not have enough of that.
1244820	1249460	I can't look in Philip DeFranco's mind and completely read his intentions, but the content
1249460	1253220	that he puts out in the context of modern media is quite refreshing, and whether the
1253220	1257660	reasons for YouTube preventing it from reaching his audience are justified or not, it would
1257660	1262100	be a great shame to lose that, either from him or from the future videos that may appear
1262100	1263100	down the road.
1263100	1266880	I believe that YouTube has great opportunity to platform people with really interesting
1266880	1270140	ideas and I hope they don't shelve that model because they're afraid of tackling
1270140	1274440	proper discussion, which although sometimes hard, is highly important.
1274440	1278700	Don't sell that off to corporations who have one singular agenda, news for views.
1278700	1282140	And as for audiences that are in question today, just stay aware, keep track of your
1282140	1286540	favourite creators, especially if they appear to be in the scope of the YouTube algorithms.
1286540	1290580	Even if DeFranco plugging in the rest of his social media seems slightly obnoxious, it's
1290580	1292300	not completely without meaning or merit.
1292300	1295620	And although DeFranco isn't someone who I am particularly concerned about, he's pretty
1295620	1299500	much set both on and off the platform, I would still like to see the cream rising to the
1299500	1300940	top if you know what I mean.
1300940	1304900	To the creators who want to cover these topics, the craft is still there, it just might require
1304900	1307800	a bit more elbow grease than was known to the genre before.
1307800	1311800	The ideas that we speak about today are not meant to extinguish hope within the creators,
1311800	1316060	but it should spur us to pay attention to something that DeFranco embodies, the grassroots
1316060	1319400	creator who does not conform to YouTube's current guidelines.
1319400	1323360	And you can call him entitled, you can call him spoiled, you can call his complaints unnecessary
1323360	1327760	because of his success, but there are still greater implications, and sometimes it's
1327760	1331560	important to disconnect the argument from the proponent, because regardless of the person
1331560	1334420	espousing it, it could just as well apply to you.
1334420	1335480	Never forget that.
1335480	1339840	So to summarise, DeFranco is a target, however I highly doubt it's anything particularly
1339840	1343780	personal, although YouTube have an agenda, it's clear they're not hellbent on silencing
1343780	1347980	other people, although the fact that DeFranco has been very vocally critical of them probably
1347980	1350800	hasn't alleviated his turbulent relationship.
1350800	1354480	Nonetheless that does not mean we shouldn't be concerned because it does mean that they're
1354480	1358540	going after a genre of content, and they could really stifle the rise of future creators
1358540	1362840	within that, and given that having rational voices in a world of reactionaries is more
1362840	1366640	relevant than ever, I think it's an asset worth defending on YouTube.
1366640	1367640	Just my opinion.
1367640	1370220	Anyhow, what are your thoughts on the topic?
1370220	1372000	What are your thoughts on Philip DeFranco?
1372000	1373060	Should he be concerned?
1373060	1374060	Should we be concerned?
1374060	1375760	I would love to hear down below.
1375760	1380180	Wanna give a big thanks to the editors who have done another stellar job on the edit,
1380180	1384000	and I will leave all their links in the description below and the pinned comment, make sure to
1384000	1387640	check them out if you have the time, some of them do remake some great content.
1387640	1390920	Also if you wanna talk you can reach me on Twitter, you can reach me on Facebook, I'm
1390920	1394520	trying to be more active in my Discord, though I have been very busy recently, and voice
1394520	1396520	chat tends to drain a lot of my time.
1396520	1399680	Not sure there's too much else to say, hope everyone's having a good day, and I hope to
1399680	1400680	see you again on this channel.
1400680	1404400	Until then however, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
