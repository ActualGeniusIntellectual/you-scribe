Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:08.960 --> 00:12.600
too much free time, and Philip DeFranco, what a character.

00:12.600 --> 00:17.040
He has one of the platform's veterans for multiple reasons, DeFranco embodies how success

00:17.040 --> 00:20.320
within YouTube can expand and develop in many unique ways.

00:20.320 --> 00:24.040
The 32 year old has been on the platform for over 10 years now and he has had his fair

00:24.040 --> 00:27.600
share of prosperity, but there are always two sides of the coin, and when you're in

00:27.600 --> 00:30.480
his position, the knives are never too far from your throat.

00:30.480 --> 00:34.680
Often my videos will involve talking about a long chain of events, and the chain of events

00:34.680 --> 00:39.160
that inspired the DeFranco show are too many to detail into one section, however I will

00:39.160 --> 00:41.760
give a brief overview of his history.

00:41.760 --> 00:45.400
DeFranco started up his channel while he was still at university in the true entrepreneurial

00:45.400 --> 00:46.400
spirit.

00:46.400 --> 00:50.440
The channel at first was called SexyPhil and obviously reflected the highly dignified manner

00:50.440 --> 00:52.240
that he was going to conduct himself with.

00:52.240 --> 00:56.240
If you can detect a slight tone of sarcasm within my voice it's because DeFranco wasn't

00:56.240 --> 01:00.760
exactly the same person 10 years ago than he is today, and one of his earliest successes

01:00.760 --> 01:05.960
was a video by the name of Big Boobs and You, which as the title described included Big

01:05.960 --> 01:09.680
Boobs and You, but mostly DeFranco discussing it.

01:09.680 --> 01:14.400
The intro is a slightly improper disclaimer warning that if you do not enjoy the objectification

01:14.400 --> 01:16.440
of women, you may not enjoy this video.

01:16.440 --> 01:20.680
I've put it a bit more politely than he did, in all fairness it is pure corn and it is

01:20.680 --> 01:24.600
quite amusing for what it's worth, and one observation that can be made is that an asset

01:24.600 --> 01:29.480
that is identifiably consistent with even his recent content is his on camera charisma,

01:29.480 --> 01:32.280
he still has that grasp with the audience.

01:32.280 --> 01:36.720
Back in the days of yore you could have low production value and still appeal to an audience,

01:36.720 --> 01:41.000
and it is amazing how technology has evolved, the sort of content that DeFranco uploaded

01:41.000 --> 01:46.040
would be ridiculed in a modern day scenario, but this was 2007 and classics like Big Boobs

01:46.040 --> 01:48.320
and You thrived in that environment.

01:48.320 --> 01:52.580
So taking the heed of its success, DeFranco made this style the centre of appeal within

01:52.580 --> 01:56.540
his channel, not Big Boobs of course, though they weren't excluded by any means, but

01:56.540 --> 02:00.580
he quickly made his videos focused around the discussion of topics that were gonna hit

02:00.580 --> 02:01.580
that appeal.

02:01.580 --> 02:05.140
Basically, Philip DeFranco was one of the earliest pioneers in the clickbait niche,

02:05.140 --> 02:09.340
but unlike his 2000s contemporaries he managed to stick it out as his personality matured

02:09.340 --> 02:13.220
like a fine cheddar, whereas many of those around him became quickly stale.

02:13.220 --> 02:17.100
He managed to stay relevant by keeping ahead of the time, as he grew he paid attention

02:17.100 --> 02:20.940
to the site changing and evolving, and in essence he evolved with it.

02:20.940 --> 02:25.020
He realised that calling people rug munchers probably would not wash with all of his newer

02:25.020 --> 02:29.460
audience, and also understood that you have to branch out to maintain success.

02:29.460 --> 02:33.000
One of the things that a majority of larger YouTubers will tell you is that you shouldn't

02:33.000 --> 02:37.160
limit your success to merely YouTube, or you quickly become dependent on a platform that

02:37.160 --> 02:39.940
can decide whether it wants you to have a good or bad day.

02:39.940 --> 02:43.620
DeFranco clearly understood this, and has ventured out on many enterprises, including

02:43.620 --> 02:48.460
multiple channels, brand deals, business undertakings, all while maintaining a strong YouTube presence.

02:48.740 --> 02:52.740
It's very clear that DeFranco has created a lot of opportunities for himself, but he

02:52.740 --> 02:56.940
still has an underlying fondness for the platform that has enabled his opportunities as he has

02:56.940 --> 02:58.700
continued to upload to this day.

02:58.700 --> 03:03.140
In many ways that respect appeared to be reciprocal, YouTube even decided to feature him in the

03:03.140 --> 03:08.980
end of their 2017 rewind, and in spite of the very rocky year for YouTube, that decision

03:08.980 --> 03:09.980
was at least praised.

03:09.980 --> 03:14.220
Love him or hate him, Philip DeFranco has persisted through many generations of YouTube

03:14.220 --> 03:17.540
and has amassed a consistent fanbase, and that is fair.

03:17.540 --> 03:21.500
This brand of news, although not necessarily exceptional within its presentation, manages

03:21.500 --> 03:25.940
to balance the delivery of information with some moderate, if fairly ordinary opinions.

03:25.940 --> 03:30.340
I think the main reason that DeFranco has retained an audience is that element of trust,

03:30.340 --> 03:35.120
unlike a lot of news corporations, he's never presented as having an ulterior agenda.

03:35.120 --> 03:38.620
Sure he has his opinions, and you're gonna agree with some and disagree with others,

03:38.620 --> 03:41.860
but it doesn't seem like he's conveying those opinions for any reason other than the

03:41.860 --> 03:45.520
fact that he likes to express himself, whereas many corporation news channels do seem to

03:45.520 --> 03:49.080
have that slanted take before they even approach the story within that.

03:49.080 --> 03:52.880
DeFranco always takes it from a case by case basis, and through that, he has definitely

03:52.880 --> 03:57.240
carved himself a niche on the YouTube landscape, however in the last year, a fair few developments

03:57.240 --> 03:58.240
have occurred.

03:58.240 --> 04:01.700
Firstly, after a series of partnerships, DeFranco announced that he had retained control of

04:01.700 --> 04:05.360
his assets and was launching the DeFranco Elite, a paid subscription that would fan

04:05.360 --> 04:09.900
fund his content, and he also announced the intention to expand on a network, and although

04:09.900 --> 04:12.920
it's all kinda vague and up in the air, that's the basic premise.

04:12.920 --> 04:17.000
In a way, he wants to become independent, and one can respect that, but the situation

04:17.000 --> 04:21.340
is greater than that, and DeFranco has uploaded multiple videos, most recently just over a

04:21.340 --> 04:26.060
month ago in which he uploaded a video titled Tired, Frustrated, but also Excited, in which

04:26.060 --> 04:30.880
he reflected over the recent wave of demonetisation on his latest content and the views that appear

04:30.880 --> 04:32.080
to have been affected by it.

04:32.080 --> 04:35.240
He has also been highly vocal about this on his Twitter.

04:35.240 --> 04:38.520
And that's what I wanted to discuss today, because the way DeFranco often discusses these

04:38.520 --> 04:42.640
problems can give an audience the perception that this is a generality in the way that

04:42.640 --> 04:43.640
YouTube are behaving.

04:43.640 --> 04:46.920
Whether intentional or not, I don't really think that's the case.

04:46.920 --> 04:47.920
What do I mean by that?

04:47.920 --> 04:55.160
Well, today I open the case of YouTube and how Philip DeFranco became a target.

04:55.160 --> 04:59.140
The thing is, I've made my videos on this budding old platform for a while, and what

04:59.140 --> 05:04.040
I know is that although a fair few videos of mine are demonetised, most are not, and

05:04.040 --> 05:07.120
the situation has significantly improved in the last few months.

05:07.120 --> 05:10.800
The algorithm is still fairly useless, but it is better, and that is something that may

05:10.800 --> 05:13.460
be surprising to anyone outside of this.

05:13.460 --> 05:18.160
To see someone as reputable as DeFranco being hit does beckon a further question about how

05:18.160 --> 05:19.160
it has happened.

05:19.160 --> 05:22.920
Nonetheless, to really understand the depth of the current situation, we have to get some

05:22.920 --> 05:27.880
history on it, and we have to go back in time, back to 2007 to be precise, to truly understand

05:27.880 --> 05:30.400
the evolution of the YouTube landscape.

05:30.680 --> 05:32.680
So, without further ado, let's get to it.

05:44.680 --> 05:49.040
YouTube was up and running, but it needed some form of income, so in May 2007 they created

05:49.040 --> 05:52.820
the partnership program, which enabled popular creators to monetise their videos with the

05:52.820 --> 05:54.800
inclusion of AdSense units.

05:54.800 --> 05:58.640
However, back then they were particularly selective, and it was individually handed

05:58.640 --> 06:00.840
out, not everyone could get a partnership.

06:04.280 --> 06:07.800
DeFranco amassing a reasonable audience himself was allocated one of these.

06:07.800 --> 06:12.520
To put this into perspective, at this point he stood alongside the likes of Smosh, Nigahiga,

06:12.520 --> 06:13.800
and Fred.

06:13.800 --> 06:14.800
Quite the clique.

06:14.800 --> 06:18.800
Eventually, as YouTube began to grow in popularity, they realised that they could expand this

06:18.800 --> 06:23.160
and became more and more liberal with how they handed out these monetisation passes.

06:23.160 --> 06:28.120
This on principle doesn't seem like an intrinsically bad idea, however as they soon found out,

06:28.120 --> 06:31.840
it came back to bite them, on the arse.

06:31.840 --> 06:37.240
YouTube continued to grow, and grow, and grow, and eventually fringe groups who would otherwise

06:37.240 --> 06:41.480
not be represented on a platform mainly about entertaining viewership, saw great opportunity

06:41.480 --> 06:46.080
to distribute propaganda, at the same time, YouTube's growth also attracted an interest

06:46.080 --> 06:50.800
of competing media who realised the actual threat that YouTube's current status posed.

06:50.800 --> 06:54.320
These were two independent but coinciding formulas that inevitably led to the media

06:54.320 --> 06:58.280
turning quite viciously on the video sharing platform, and DeFranco himself was obviously

06:58.280 --> 07:01.920
caught up in the fray of this, but what a lot of people tend to forget is that he was

07:01.920 --> 07:06.040
actually caught by YouTube's pre-emptive measures, you know, the ones that absolutely failed

07:06.040 --> 07:08.600
even before YouTube imploded in on itself.

07:08.600 --> 07:26.040
In 2016, yes 2016, he uploaded a video titled, YouTube is shutting down my channel and I'm

07:26.040 --> 07:27.040
not sure what to do.

07:27.040 --> 07:31.520
A video in which he begins by citing concerns on the demonetisation of his previous video,

07:31.520 --> 07:35.040
but as the video progresses, we witness him learning more about the issues surrounding

07:35.040 --> 07:38.440
his channel, and closing with him asking what the plan of action should be.

07:38.440 --> 07:43.400
As of May 2018, that video has attained over 6 million views.

07:43.400 --> 07:47.400
This concern about monetisation has now been extended to a concern about views, in this

07:47.400 --> 07:51.480
video we mentioned earlier how he noted that although monetisation may not be a problem

07:51.480 --> 07:54.960
in itself, he was receiving feedback from viewers that they weren't being notified

07:54.960 --> 07:59.840
of new episodes, particularly prevalent in videos that had been denied ads on appeal.

07:59.840 --> 08:03.080
Now one of the statements that he posed in his original video about demonetisation was

08:03.080 --> 08:06.820
this suggestion that YouTube might be trying to force him off the platform, but why would

08:06.820 --> 08:07.820
they do that?

08:07.820 --> 08:10.600
Why would they try to censor one of their most iconic creators?

08:10.600 --> 08:12.080
Well let's break down the main options.

08:12.080 --> 08:15.800
The first option is probably the most cynical, that YouTube has an agenda and that Philip

08:15.800 --> 08:19.460
DeFranco doesn't align with it, and that they are actively trying to suppress his voice

08:19.460 --> 08:23.640
on the platform, and eventually want to kick him off.

08:23.640 --> 08:28.060
The second option is that due to YouTube rewriting their terms and conditions, DeFranco was caught

08:28.060 --> 08:32.320
by the fallout of such rules and therefore lost monetisation on many of his videos, or

08:32.320 --> 08:34.720
the third which we'll save to later.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.320
Which one is it?

08:36.320 --> 08:48.500
Let's try and work it out.

08:48.500 --> 08:49.500
Option one.

08:49.500 --> 08:52.760
Now it is quite clear that YouTube has an agenda, you go on their channel, and you can

08:52.760 --> 08:56.820
see that they're trying to appeal to that wide-eyed millennial charm that many advertisers

08:56.820 --> 09:01.280
like to see, it's wafer thin and transparent, but you guess it does the job, but is it something

09:01.280 --> 09:02.280
more deeply ingrained?

09:02.280 --> 09:06.920
Well to do that we have to assume that demonetisation is going to hurt DeFranco's voice, how would

09:06.920 --> 09:07.920
they do that?

09:07.920 --> 09:12.200
Cutting money probably won't make the difference, especially as he now has a separate subscription

09:12.200 --> 09:16.200
service so they must be trying to cut the views and get rid of his representation, but

09:16.200 --> 09:20.300
to do that we'd have to at least be able to imply that there is an algorithm that is

09:20.300 --> 09:21.540
reducing views.

09:21.540 --> 09:25.620
To do that we have YouTuber Nerd City, who revealed some revelations of his own kind,

09:25.620 --> 09:29.720
in his first video uploaded approximately half a year after the original demonetisation

09:29.720 --> 09:34.240
scandal he published information from a researcher known as Cielo, who found a significant difference

09:34.240 --> 09:38.940
in relative views between content that was monetised and content that was demonetised.

09:38.940 --> 09:42.940
However YouTube responded, saying that demonetisation didn't cause the loss in views.

09:42.940 --> 09:47.640
Well well well, everyone for a moment seemed briefly stumped, but lack of causation doesn't

09:47.640 --> 09:52.080
mean there isn't a correlation, and perhaps a third variable that influences both of these

09:52.080 --> 09:53.080
outcomes.

09:53.080 --> 09:56.680
And returning to the drawing board, Cielo published more comprehensive findings that

09:56.680 --> 10:01.040
basically meant that although the monetisation system may have ran independently, there was

10:01.040 --> 10:06.400
a consistent link, this time to a rating system that gave videos rated mature, less views,

10:06.400 --> 10:10.840
and one which advertisers used themselves to discern which videos they wanted to promote

10:10.840 --> 10:11.840
on.

10:11.840 --> 10:16.020
So we've attributed a much more clearer cause, and one that hasn't been disputed.

10:16.020 --> 10:20.880
Now demonetised videos get less views, although the cause of it isn't the demonetisation,

10:20.880 --> 10:25.360
there is a correlation, we can say that demonetised videos are more likely to be rated mature

10:25.360 --> 10:29.440
as well, and thus garner less views, and given the fact that advertisers base their

10:29.440 --> 10:33.520
promotion around the rating system in question, means that obviously there is going to be

10:33.520 --> 10:35.920
a tremendously noticeable link.

10:35.920 --> 10:40.100
So we establish a connection, suppressing monetisation could suppress views, they could

10:40.100 --> 10:42.720
be censoring Philip DeFranco, why would they do that?

10:42.720 --> 10:46.720
Well he certainly doesn't fit the politically correct shield that YouTube often attempt

10:46.720 --> 10:51.520
to push, DeFranco himself is a libertarian, and it shows, in his old content he's an edgy

10:51.520 --> 11:00.400
boy, and is new he still retains a very unique tone, sure it's infinitely more mature,

11:00.400 --> 11:04.040
but if there's one thing that companies don't like, it's individuals who cannot

11:04.040 --> 11:09.640
be externally influenced, and some have credibly hypothesised that DeFranco is just too independent

11:09.640 --> 11:14.520
for the platform, given their recent push for the content that is a lot more focus tested.

11:14.520 --> 11:19.000
DeFranco has visibly been unhappy about that, he's been one of the most vocal in calling

11:19.000 --> 11:22.560
them out on a lot of bullshit that's been going on behind the scenes, even if they didn't

11:22.560 --> 11:24.680
hate him before, they sure hate him now.

11:24.680 --> 11:28.840
One of the most notable situations was in the aftermath of the Las Vegas attack, when

11:28.840 --> 11:33.640
Casey Neistat made a video in which he notified users that he created a GoFundMe and also

11:33.640 --> 11:38.340
pledged any adsense from that video, however his video was demonetised and he tweeted to

11:38.340 --> 11:43.200
vent his frustration, YouTube responded saying that they have a clear policy on it, fair

11:43.200 --> 11:47.340
enough, not for Phil, in a humiliating moment for YouTube he revealed that they were happily

11:47.340 --> 11:51.560
running advertisements on other content based around the tragedy, in this instance the Jimmy

11:51.560 --> 11:54.760
Kimmel content, they're always pushing into our faces.

11:54.760 --> 11:58.980
The tweet, and the subsequent video he released attracted a ton of publicity, and I guarantee

11:58.980 --> 12:02.980
that DeFranco didn't make many new friends at YouTube headquarters that day, however

12:02.980 --> 12:06.540
if they actually wanted to suppress DeFranco, why haven't they hit him harder?

12:06.540 --> 12:11.820
What's important here is the huge surge of young people that tuned in to see the grand jury announcement,

12:11.820 --> 12:16.700
and then unfortunately to see the violence that followed afterwards, I've heard many complaints about-

12:16.700 --> 12:20.780
Well it's about the backlash effect, many people have the power to manipulate the world

12:20.780 --> 12:25.520
around them, many have the power to manipulate other people or algorithms and so on, however

12:25.520 --> 12:29.220
the moment that those people realise that they are being manipulated they will likely

12:29.220 --> 12:33.520
wholly turn on the manipulator, so if YouTube really did want to usher DeFranco off the

12:33.520 --> 12:38.640
website they'd have to do it by very subtle coercion, as he has extensive influence over

12:38.640 --> 12:42.720
a large audience, he'd likely still make a lot of noise regardless, but they'd have

12:42.720 --> 12:47.060
to make it seem natural enough so other people didn't care or people felt that his complaints

12:47.060 --> 12:48.560
were unjustified.

12:48.560 --> 12:53.100
So we've handed YouTube a means, motive and opportunity, but just because that option

12:53.100 --> 12:55.960
makes sense, doesn't mean it's the only sensible option.

12:55.960 --> 12:59.840
Let's discuss the second option, as I said earlier, back when YouTube were being very

12:59.840 --> 13:04.380
selective with who they partnered with, DeFranco would obviously receive an unconditional pass

13:04.380 --> 13:07.200
because he was part of a very special group of people.

13:07.200 --> 13:11.920
By the time YouTube implemented new guidelines in the end of 2015, the most exclusive set

13:11.920 --> 13:16.680
of creators they had were the Google preferred lineup, and DeFranco was not a part of that.

13:16.680 --> 13:20.720
YouTube's guidelines were quite general, and content that may be about certain events,

13:20.720 --> 13:23.980
particularly ones that involve tragedy, could be demonetised.

13:23.980 --> 13:27.760
Philip DeFranco's style makes him particularly successful to this, when he was a smaller

13:27.760 --> 13:32.320
YouTuber he'd go for very classic clickbait, now he's more reputable, his brand of titling

13:32.320 --> 13:36.440
involves naming each and every story that he includes, and works in a way of enticing

13:36.440 --> 13:37.440
the viewer in.

13:37.440 --> 13:41.560
Having multiple stories should hit multiple demographics right, but it also makes it incredibly

13:41.560 --> 13:46.380
easy for YouTube to exactly explain why they may not like a topic or a video, and may find

13:46.380 --> 13:48.520
it ineligible for monetisation.

13:48.520 --> 13:51.800
Many of you will know my channel has covered political topics in the past, and although

13:51.800 --> 13:56.880
they've sometimes been sensitive, an overwhelming amount of them have not been demonetised.

13:56.880 --> 14:00.880
This may surprise some of you to know, but it is true, with Philip DeFranco though, three

14:00.880 --> 14:05.580
of his four topics in a video may be perfectly suitable for monetisation, however all it

14:05.580 --> 14:10.240
takes is one topic to be inappropriate, and the other topics are taken out too, that is

14:10.240 --> 14:13.480
the problem when you try to kill a few birds with one stone.

14:13.480 --> 14:17.040
So it's possible that Philip DeFranco has not been specifically targeted, but it is

14:17.040 --> 14:21.560
just one of the many who have been demonetised due to the new indiscriminate guidelines,

14:21.560 --> 14:25.040
and those who haven't been affected, well it's just different rules for them.

14:25.040 --> 14:29.560
DeFranco isn't individually being targeted, he's just not in the in-group, and he's

14:29.560 --> 14:33.560
been one of the hardest impacted because of the style of his videos that encompass certain

14:33.560 --> 14:38.280
sensitive topics, and it's clear that YouTube still have no clue what they're really doing.

14:38.280 --> 14:42.560
The general demonetisation approach however, lies on the assumption that the topics covered

14:42.560 --> 14:47.300
are actually being demonetised on other channels as well, for example Philip DeFranco covers

14:47.300 --> 14:52.200
a bullying incident and it gets demonetised as part of the greater video, and it would

14:52.200 --> 14:56.620
obviously make sense if other videos on the topic were being demonetised too.

14:56.620 --> 15:00.040
I do not know that I cannot confirm that, you'd probably have to actually carry out

15:00.040 --> 15:04.480
research into whether there is an exceptionalism occurring, people who talk about a wide range

15:04.480 --> 15:08.440
of slightly more serious topics have often found themselves demonetised, another example

15:08.440 --> 15:11.440
of that is the Rubin report, because they cover so much there's going to be something

15:11.440 --> 15:15.840
that hits a soft spot, even though they may cover it in a completely respectful manner,

15:15.840 --> 15:19.120
and Philip DeFranco, a man who would check this for himself, must understand that this

15:19.120 --> 15:20.280
is the scenario right?

15:20.600 --> 15:24.400
But this is where I bring in the third option, because although I'm not an avid viewer

15:24.400 --> 15:28.680
of the DeFranco show, I had to watch a fair few of his videos to familiarise myself with

15:28.680 --> 15:32.600
his content, and one thing that really stood out to me was how moderate he is.

15:34.760 --> 15:38.600
Even if he did cover more sensitive topics, he often handled it with a nuance that I can

15:38.600 --> 15:42.640
see being completely open to support from YouTube and monetisation, like many of the

15:42.640 --> 15:46.520
Daily Show hosts they shove in our face, the only thing that differentiates DeFranco from

15:46.520 --> 15:50.600
these characters is the fact that he's based on YouTube and talks about their problems

15:50.600 --> 15:51.600
a bit.

15:51.600 --> 15:54.060
YouTube mates, there's nothing wrong with a bit of self reflection.

15:54.060 --> 15:58.280
So for me it comes down to this, YouTube implemented new guidelines, now they most likely were

15:58.280 --> 16:03.520
not directly targeting DeFranco and his content, but he was hit with a few other creators who

16:03.520 --> 16:06.880
have been covered under this general sweep of recent.

16:06.880 --> 16:10.860
However, when presented with this scenario, DeFranco went straight for the jugular, publishing

16:10.860 --> 16:15.400
a 6 million plus view video, and after a long line of incidents, it seems that although

16:15.440 --> 16:19.640
YouTube may not have the intent to make his situation worse, it's clear that they're not

16:19.640 --> 16:23.920
necessarily interested in helping him becoming exempt to these predicaments.

16:23.920 --> 16:28.960
To put it gently, the algorithms that they've created kinda suck, because it judges on topic

16:28.960 --> 16:32.580
alone rather than what the actual message is or how it's articulated.

16:32.580 --> 16:36.420
I'll point you in the direction again of Nerd City's video for this, that there are situations

16:36.420 --> 16:39.760
in which the bot isn't able to distinguish between a video telling you about why you

16:39.760 --> 16:44.160
shouldn't commit suicide, and content such as the Logan Paul Forest Adventure.

16:44.160 --> 16:45.640
That does not make sense.

16:45.640 --> 16:51.120
Philip DeFranco epitomises the sort of collateral damage of YouTube's new algorithm, advertisers

16:51.120 --> 16:55.580
put their content on plenty of TV news channels, and DeFranco's content is basically that but

16:55.580 --> 16:56.580
a bit more profane.

16:56.580 --> 16:59.360
And let's face it, who gives a fuck about swearing?

16:59.360 --> 17:03.660
Sure it's on a spectrum, but most videos, even videos on Google Preferred, have explicit

17:03.660 --> 17:04.660
language included.

17:04.660 --> 17:09.800
Essentially, it's the topics that get DeFranco, and it's the easy option for YouTube.

17:09.800 --> 17:10.800
But is it the right one?

17:14.800 --> 17:17.880
Often when having this discussion, there'll normally be one person who points out that

17:17.880 --> 17:22.000
it's YouTube's platform and therefore it is their prerogative to do what they want.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.640
And they are completely right.

17:23.640 --> 17:26.020
That's not the discussion that I'm trying to have today.

17:26.020 --> 17:29.800
To summarise, just because they can do it, doesn't mean they should do it.

17:29.800 --> 17:33.740
Given the sheer authority that YouTube has over the competition, it would be ideal if

17:33.740 --> 17:37.840
they could remain unbiased, and also look out for some of their own creators who actually

17:37.840 --> 17:39.760
make decent productive content.

17:39.760 --> 17:43.480
I think people are becoming increasingly sick of the celebrities they try to ship in each

17:43.480 --> 17:45.880
month, it seems tired and frustrating.

17:45.880 --> 17:49.580
Not because people hate celebrities, but because they don't lean on YouTube the same way that

17:49.580 --> 17:51.560
people like DeFranco have in the past.

17:51.560 --> 17:55.720
What makes so many stories inspiring about YouTube is that you, the ordinary person,

17:55.720 --> 18:00.000
can express your creativity, and people can actually support it in a creative way.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.040
You don't need any huge corporate investment, you just need a bit of intuition and a half

18:04.040 --> 18:06.720
decent microphone, and camera in some instances.

18:06.720 --> 18:10.720
This spans over a wide range of topics, current affairs included.

18:10.720 --> 18:15.400
The thing is, suppressing the actual sensible takes on often complex topics, and yet allowing

18:15.400 --> 18:19.640
the other corporations to populate the site is a risky business, because they can survive

18:19.640 --> 18:24.080
without the site, and they have survived without the site, and then YouTube just becomes another

18:24.080 --> 18:25.720
funnel for mainstream media.

18:25.720 --> 18:29.800
And yes, people like DeFranco will obviously persist regardless of these circumstances,

18:29.800 --> 18:33.760
but he will not live forever, and eventually people will look towards new creators to try

18:33.760 --> 18:36.500
and fill the gap for the recent takes on these topics.

18:36.500 --> 18:40.400
The current algorithms that YouTube appear to have created do not benefit that, and that

18:40.400 --> 18:41.560
is a great shame.

18:41.560 --> 18:45.660
My main concern is that through that, you create a culture of two-times creators.

18:45.660 --> 18:49.480
People who don't really focus on delivering the news, but more on creating a highly committed

18:49.480 --> 18:53.300
cult following that will sustain them, and the other side being the corporate-sponsored

18:53.300 --> 18:57.900
number-driven media who equally don't care on delivering news, and I do not like that

18:57.900 --> 18:58.900
prospect.

18:58.900 --> 19:02.800
I think the likes of CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, etc. are shit.

19:02.800 --> 19:06.760
I can't stand how they all go into their content with such a thinly veiled pre-aligned

19:06.760 --> 19:07.760
agenda.

19:07.760 --> 19:08.760
And you know what?

19:08.760 --> 19:12.080
I can say that because it's my fucking opinion, and that's what people want to hear.

19:12.080 --> 19:15.320
When you watch these news channels, it often feels like you're not hearing that opinion,

19:15.320 --> 19:17.920
and more what they think will make people tune in.

19:17.920 --> 19:22.560
Gaining respect from being reasonable is such a gradual process because it doesn't rely

19:22.560 --> 19:26.720
on those immediate emotional reactions that may be elicited from the audience in light

19:26.720 --> 19:27.720
of events.

19:27.720 --> 19:30.960
It relies on actual rationality, reflection, and consideration.

19:31.120 --> 19:35.680
However, once that reasonability becomes a trusted source, it can genuinely aid how people

19:35.680 --> 19:37.660
respond to crises in the future.

19:37.660 --> 19:41.660
That's why I think DeFranco's brand of commentary, whether entirely earnest or not, is still

19:41.660 --> 19:42.840
an important one.

19:42.840 --> 19:46.560
People tend to say that his complaints come across as self-centred and egocentric, and

19:46.560 --> 19:50.360
I think that is a justified critique when rewatching the videos some of his statements

19:50.360 --> 19:52.400
can come across as a bit awkward.

19:52.400 --> 19:56.500
But whether his motivations are focused around his own interests or not, his complaints still

19:56.500 --> 20:01.160
have an applicability that I personally believe to be beneficial to creator well-being.

20:01.160 --> 20:05.500
So I guess the real integrity test will be if he does choose to leave the site, how only

20:05.500 --> 20:08.840
he will continue to report on such issues affecting creators.

20:08.840 --> 20:13.060
Of course, I do not believe he will leave the site, regardless of the network he creates,

20:13.060 --> 20:17.500
YouTube is so front and centre that it would take a monumental shift to steal even a fraction

20:17.500 --> 20:19.160
of the power away from them.

20:19.160 --> 20:23.220
The truth is, as the site expands in its grasp and develops further, the opportunities for

20:23.220 --> 20:26.740
new creators will typically pivot, doors will open and doors will close.

20:26.740 --> 20:30.800
But we don't want any of those doors to be fully locked, nor do we want certain doors

20:30.800 --> 20:35.620
to only be open to very few people, people with less than amiable intentions at that.

20:35.620 --> 20:40.220
We want people to still have a chance, especially if that chance involves discussing topics

20:40.220 --> 20:42.660
in an actually reasonable and sensible way.

20:42.660 --> 20:44.820
Even now, we do not have enough of that.

20:44.820 --> 20:49.460
I can't look in Philip DeFranco's mind and completely read his intentions, but the content

20:49.460 --> 20:53.220
that he puts out in the context of modern media is quite refreshing, and whether the

20:53.220 --> 20:57.660
reasons for YouTube preventing it from reaching his audience are justified or not, it would

20:57.660 --> 21:02.100
be a great shame to lose that, either from him or from the future videos that may appear

21:02.100 --> 21:03.100
down the road.

21:03.100 --> 21:06.880
I believe that YouTube has great opportunity to platform people with really interesting

21:06.880 --> 21:10.140
ideas and I hope they don't shelve that model because they're afraid of tackling

21:10.140 --> 21:14.440
proper discussion, which although sometimes hard, is highly important.

21:14.440 --> 21:18.700
Don't sell that off to corporations who have one singular agenda, news for views.

21:18.700 --> 21:22.140
And as for audiences that are in question today, just stay aware, keep track of your

21:22.140 --> 21:26.540
favourite creators, especially if they appear to be in the scope of the YouTube algorithms.

21:26.540 --> 21:30.580
Even if DeFranco plugging in the rest of his social media seems slightly obnoxious, it's

21:30.580 --> 21:32.300
not completely without meaning or merit.

21:32.300 --> 21:35.620
And although DeFranco isn't someone who I am particularly concerned about, he's pretty

21:35.620 --> 21:39.500
much set both on and off the platform, I would still like to see the cream rising to the

21:39.500 --> 21:40.940
top if you know what I mean.

21:40.940 --> 21:44.900
To the creators who want to cover these topics, the craft is still there, it just might require

21:44.900 --> 21:47.800
a bit more elbow grease than was known to the genre before.

21:47.800 --> 21:51.800
The ideas that we speak about today are not meant to extinguish hope within the creators,

21:51.800 --> 21:56.060
but it should spur us to pay attention to something that DeFranco embodies, the grassroots

21:56.060 --> 21:59.400
creator who does not conform to YouTube's current guidelines.

21:59.400 --> 22:03.360
And you can call him entitled, you can call him spoiled, you can call his complaints unnecessary

22:03.360 --> 22:07.760
because of his success, but there are still greater implications, and sometimes it's

22:07.760 --> 22:11.560
important to disconnect the argument from the proponent, because regardless of the person

22:11.560 --> 22:14.420
espousing it, it could just as well apply to you.

22:14.420 --> 22:15.480
Never forget that.

22:15.480 --> 22:19.840
So to summarise, DeFranco is a target, however I highly doubt it's anything particularly

22:19.840 --> 22:23.780
personal, although YouTube have an agenda, it's clear they're not hellbent on silencing

22:23.780 --> 22:27.980
other people, although the fact that DeFranco has been very vocally critical of them probably

22:27.980 --> 22:30.800
hasn't alleviated his turbulent relationship.

22:30.800 --> 22:34.480
Nonetheless that does not mean we shouldn't be concerned because it does mean that they're

22:34.480 --> 22:38.540
going after a genre of content, and they could really stifle the rise of future creators

22:38.540 --> 22:42.840
within that, and given that having rational voices in a world of reactionaries is more

22:42.840 --> 22:46.640
relevant than ever, I think it's an asset worth defending on YouTube.

22:46.640 --> 22:47.640
Just my opinion.

22:47.640 --> 22:50.220
Anyhow, what are your thoughts on the topic?

22:50.220 --> 22:52.000
What are your thoughts on Philip DeFranco?

22:52.000 --> 22:53.060
Should he be concerned?

22:53.060 --> 22:54.060
Should we be concerned?

22:54.060 --> 22:55.760
I would love to hear down below.

22:55.760 --> 23:00.180
Wanna give a big thanks to the editors who have done another stellar job on the edit,

23:00.180 --> 23:04.000
and I will leave all their links in the description below and the pinned comment, make sure to

23:04.000 --> 23:07.640
check them out if you have the time, some of them do remake some great content.

23:07.640 --> 23:10.920
Also if you wanna talk you can reach me on Twitter, you can reach me on Facebook, I'm

23:10.920 --> 23:14.520
trying to be more active in my Discord, though I have been very busy recently, and voice

23:14.520 --> 23:16.520
chat tends to drain a lot of my time.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.680
Not sure there's too much else to say, hope everyone's having a good day, and I hope to

23:19.680 --> 23:20.680
see you again on this channel.

23:20.680 --> 23:24.400
Until then however, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
