00:00.000 --> 00:11.800
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:11.800 --> 00:15.620
too much free time, and Twitch streamers, a unique brand of crater.

00:15.620 --> 00:18.720
We've spoken about them a few times on this channel, but there's always new corners

00:18.720 --> 00:23.540
to explore, and as always, that's what we'll be doing today, we'll be invading Twitch

00:23.540 --> 00:27.200
from the sidelines of YouTube, because Twitch and YouTube, although having a lot of crater

00:27.200 --> 00:31.480
overlap, also have very different dynamics, which is why there are people who use both

00:31.480 --> 00:32.480
platforms.

00:32.480 --> 00:34.840
In a way, it seems there is a mutual understanding.

00:34.840 --> 00:38.640
Twitch understand that they probably can't compete with YouTube's upload features,

00:38.640 --> 00:42.680
and YouTube, although attempting to have their own stream assets, know that Twitch's specialised

00:42.680 --> 00:45.440
setup is a bit more of a step up from their own.

00:45.440 --> 00:49.880
Twitch and YouTube, however, due to that overlap, will have somewhat similar audiences, and

00:49.880 --> 00:54.000
that means that you can typically expect that you will find some underlying commonalities

00:54.000 --> 00:58.480
in the popular content craters, one of those markets being attractive females.

00:58.480 --> 01:03.080
Now being an attractive female does not predispose you to success, but in the glorious society

01:03.080 --> 01:07.400
that we live in, many younger individuals, and slightly older individuals, feel excitement

01:07.400 --> 01:09.580
from viewing people who may be attractive.

01:09.580 --> 01:14.080
Probably the YouTube embodiment of this crater is SS SnipeWolf, you know, that person who

01:14.080 --> 01:18.280
won a gaming award even though she barely games, and she switched her reaction commentary

01:18.280 --> 01:22.720
ages ago, you know, she flossed, and although I can't say for sure, my judgement deemed

01:22.720 --> 01:26.360
it lacking the sufficient irony to be classed as remotely humorous.

01:26.360 --> 01:31.600
She's also doing very little gusto, I want more effort next time, SS SnipeWolf.

01:31.600 --> 01:36.240
Now I don't doubt that she has a great business mind, I mean, you kinda have to when you've

01:36.240 --> 01:40.960
been a criminal, but as a curator, her work does sometimes leave a lot to be desired.

01:40.960 --> 02:01.680
This is what I class as the sort of attractive female content, and I'm not saying that obviously

02:01.680 --> 02:06.660
this is the sole prerequisite, there's a reason I haven't started doing facecam content yet,

02:06.660 --> 02:10.600
and it's clear that it's good clickbait that might grab external audiences, but in the

02:10.600 --> 02:15.800
core fanbase, well yeah, you can note some trends, the various moods after winning the

02:15.800 --> 02:21.240
award, congrats Leah, you deserve the award from our wolf pack support, you look gorgeous,

02:21.240 --> 02:27.360
the ceremony, by the way, hearty eyes, hearty eyes, fire, fire, and then 4 pictures, but

02:27.360 --> 02:29.520
I guess she looks gorgeous in all of them.

02:29.520 --> 02:34.200
So yes, SS SnipeWolf may be the best example of the exploitation of that sort of appeal,

02:34.200 --> 02:38.840
however very few people necessarily see her reflective of YouTube's cultural landscape,

02:38.840 --> 02:42.840
in spite of the significant views she pulls, and the number of times she ends up on YouTube's

02:42.840 --> 02:46.720
trending. If I was to say, women of YouTube, people would probably come up with a variety

02:46.720 --> 02:52.560
of answers, Lele Pons, Jenna Marbles, Lilly Singh, etc, etc, etc.

02:52.560 --> 02:56.780
If you asked any standard creator about the women of Twitch, however, well you'd probably

02:56.780 --> 03:00.660
hear an answer that encapsulates one of the more notorious genres. The word that some

03:00.660 --> 03:05.520
people like to use is thot, but here on the right opinion, we are respectful of women,

03:05.520 --> 03:09.760
and being a ladies man has given me ample training for that. It's strange because there

03:09.760 --> 03:13.960
are a variety of female Twitch streamers, but ultimately the perception has been tainted

03:13.960 --> 03:17.520
by the existence of many things, including the commentator.

03:17.520 --> 03:23.440
Oh Twitch girls, the crème de la crème of online content.

03:23.440 --> 03:29.000
One thing that transcends platforms is the existence of irritating commentators, who

03:29.000 --> 03:34.080
have opinions on everything, damn people with opinions, who would dare have those? Now I

03:34.080 --> 03:38.040
don't mean the commentators are on Twitch necessarily, I mean heaven forbid what would

03:38.040 --> 03:41.360
happen if that was the case, but in the last couple years, because of the market, people

03:41.360 --> 03:45.240
have gone after the brand of Twitch streamer that is at the centre of attention today,

03:45.240 --> 03:49.600
and has definitely put them at the forefront of Twitch's image for better and for worse.

03:49.600 --> 03:53.420
Why though? Well a lot of streamers like that have always existed on the platform, but the

03:53.420 --> 03:58.080
image really became synonymous with the rise of people like Zoe Burger, who not just became

03:58.080 --> 04:02.580
infamous for that behaviour, but also crossed the line over to the YouTube sphere thus garnering

04:02.580 --> 04:06.900
the attention of many commentators at that time. Although Zoe Burger's fame was short

04:06.900 --> 04:11.300
lived, the attention persisted, and eventually many female streamers became pretty popular

04:11.300 --> 04:16.020
amongst commentary circles on YouTube as well. Ultimately this created a cycle, and the commentary

04:16.020 --> 04:19.100
that we witness today is a byproduct of that.

04:19.100 --> 04:24.900
However, people being popular is an interesting concept on its own, because as a popular creator,

04:24.900 --> 04:28.940
there is always a level of accountability to one's audience that a creator should feel.

04:28.940 --> 04:33.620
Nonetheless, the level of inherent accountability is often based off the appeal of the creator.

04:33.620 --> 04:37.560
I've spoken about this before, so I won't linger on it too much.

04:37.560 --> 04:40.740
Commentators and streamers have clashed on a few occasions, probably the most notable

04:40.740 --> 04:45.580
one earlier this year was when Pokimane was called out by PewDiePie, and some other creators

04:45.580 --> 04:50.300
for some rather poor behaviour. She did actually respond to it, and was quite involved in drama

04:50.300 --> 04:54.580
following the situation, however one thing that she did attempt to do was engage with

04:54.580 --> 04:59.620
the other side, and not be combative. However, being pleasant is more of a liberty when your

04:59.620 --> 05:03.420
appeal is based off something not related to your direct demeanour, and that brings

05:03.420 --> 05:04.740
us to Alinity.

05:04.740 --> 05:10.120
Alinity, also known as Alinity Divine, is a 31 year old creator residing in Canada,

05:10.120 --> 05:14.660
although she was initially born and raised in Colombia. She began streaming in 2012,

05:14.660 --> 05:20.300
and over the years has built a follower base of over 930,000. Not something to be jeered

05:20.300 --> 05:26.540
against. Her content consists of gaming streams and videos, discussion and some physical activities.

05:26.540 --> 05:30.700
This obviously makes some of the viewers very satisfied on browsing her recent clips, I

05:30.700 --> 05:35.620
picked one named Six, which was a rather innocent video involving her dog, however the thumbnail

05:35.620 --> 05:41.500
had been picked fairly carefully, and it was not a wonder that this was her second most

05:41.500 --> 05:43.060
viewed clip of recent.

05:43.060 --> 05:46.940
For a long time, Alinity was just another female streamer doing her thing, but in the

05:46.940 --> 05:51.100
last couple of years something changed, a run of incidents that left her at odds with

05:51.100 --> 05:55.860
many people, particularly the commentator, escalating most recently with many people

05:55.860 --> 06:01.660
calling for her removal from the platform due to the treatment of her cat. However,

06:01.660 --> 06:06.460
if this was the only incident, would people really be calling for her termination? Well,

06:06.460 --> 06:11.680
I think we should find out. Today I want to discuss exactly how Alinity came to fame,

06:11.680 --> 06:16.360
how she came to notoriety, and exactly what led people up to the point where many think

06:16.360 --> 06:20.880
that she has to be stopped. It's a long story, but I assume you're ready, because

06:20.880 --> 06:22.840
you've got this far. Let's go.

06:29.480 --> 06:34.680
Alinity has been streaming for almost seven years. Now, it is difficult to find any comprehensive

06:34.680 --> 06:37.840
history, however we can look at the growth of her channel, and one thing that struck

06:37.840 --> 06:43.320
me was that, providing the information I found was accurate, her growth came pretty instantaneously.

06:43.320 --> 06:47.320
She streamed every day for four to eight hours, with the main goal to raise the monies

06:47.320 --> 06:51.900
to ride a stable income for her lifestyle, given her university training as a nurse.

06:51.900 --> 06:56.480
Her main focus at the time was World of Warcraft, and she seemed to have a decent base of supporters

06:56.480 --> 07:03.040
that were committed. By mid-2013 she had around 26,000 followers, but around 3.5 million views.

07:03.040 --> 07:07.100
She was somewhat known in the community, and was involved in some camaraderie. In this

07:07.100 --> 07:11.460
clip she supposedly went on an e-date with another streamer, and you can feel the romantic

07:11.460 --> 07:13.980
chemistry radiating off the screen.

07:13.980 --> 07:18.180
I forgot to give you these flowers when we first got here. I forgot I'm in the limo.

07:18.180 --> 07:24.200
That's where I just went right now, but... I would like you to have these flowers.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.800
Because they're pretty, and...

07:25.800 --> 07:27.900
I gotta, I gotta put your...

07:27.900 --> 07:29.060
There, okay.

07:29.060 --> 07:31.460
Oh, you got me flowers!

07:31.460 --> 07:32.340
Yeah.

07:35.340 --> 07:36.620
They're pretty.

07:36.620 --> 07:40.820
She also posted some pictures to Twitter, which received positive reactions from her

07:40.820 --> 07:45.780
audience. Generally, even in 2013, however, people had the impression that she wasn't

07:45.780 --> 07:50.860
exactly known for her personality, many comments claiming that, as people went, she was rather

07:50.860 --> 07:55.660
vapid. It kinda made me feel bad if I was accepting the idea that she didn't necessarily

07:55.660 --> 08:00.300
see herself that way, although I kind of have a hunch she did know what she was doing, especially

08:00.300 --> 08:02.620
when she puts her feet pics on the market.

08:02.620 --> 08:08.020
If you guys are able to carry me to the 1900s, I'll give you feet pictures.

08:08.020 --> 08:09.340
Yes!

08:09.340 --> 08:09.840
Yeah.

08:09.840 --> 08:16.260
We did it! We did it! Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude! No, shut up! We're in! We can do that in just two weeks!

08:16.260 --> 08:22.820
However, on the 17th of August 2013, she announced that she was done streaming, and therefore, that was the end of

08:22.820 --> 08:27.860
Alinity. Thank you for watching. I jest, I jest. I'm guessing this was something to do with someone

08:27.860 --> 08:32.980
called Bodobo. In the situation which I admit I found rather hard to follow, it seems that Alinity

08:32.980 --> 08:37.620
wasn't happy with some of the things that Bodobo was saying about what she deemed to be her private

08:37.620 --> 08:42.420
life, and Bodobo, on the other hand, wasn't happy with how Alinity has been behaving with certain

08:42.420 --> 08:47.940
individuals and not being honest about details of her relationships. This ultimately led to a Skype call

08:47.940 --> 08:52.980
in which some strong words were exchanged. Is this what 2013 streamers did? I don't know.

08:52.980 --> 08:58.660
But immediately what we can see here is some early evidence that Alinity isn't exactly afraid of

08:58.660 --> 09:02.980
confrontation. In fact, she's not exactly the coolest of cucumbers.

09:03.060 --> 09:08.660
And you don't have any, any control over my life to start talking shit about me. What are these

09:08.660 --> 09:14.260
things I'm hiding? These horrible things I'm hiding? Tell me, tell me what they are, because I really

09:14.260 --> 09:19.460
want to know what it is that I'm hiding. Tell me what it is that I'm hiding. Can I talk now?

09:20.340 --> 09:22.020
Yeah, talk! What it is that I'm hiding.

09:24.500 --> 09:28.740
Okay, first off, I don't- What it is that I'm hiding right now? Tell me!

09:28.740 --> 09:31.380
Holy shit.

09:31.380 --> 09:35.140
Now, there is clearly a lot of context missing to this call, and I don't know what happened

09:35.140 --> 09:39.780
behind the scenes. Alinity's outburst may come from a genuine place, but regardless of what

09:39.780 --> 09:43.540
happened, it's fair to say that many of us probably wouldn't have reacted like this just because

09:43.540 --> 09:48.660
someone was chatting bare shit. Alinity definitely doesn't come across as someone who takes these

09:48.660 --> 09:53.620
things in the most relaxed demeanor. Also, I thought I'd show you this cheeky clip. Keep this

09:53.620 --> 09:54.580
in mind for later.

09:54.580 --> 10:00.820
Okay, we know each other from a long time ago, and you know things about my past. Yes, I was married.

10:00.820 --> 10:09.220
Yes, I got divorced. Yes, I came to Canada on a sponsorship, and there's things about my life that

10:09.220 --> 10:11.860
I'd rather not discuss over the internet with people.

10:11.860 --> 10:16.340
Obviously, however, her content was more than World of Warcraft, and when researching,

10:16.340 --> 10:20.820
especially perusing Reddit comments, many people disputed her, some branding her as a

10:21.060 --> 10:24.980
twerk for subs individuals who would exploit their rather impressive physique for their

10:24.980 --> 10:28.980
viewers. Others, however, defended her, saying that people were just looking for reasons to

10:28.980 --> 10:33.460
hate her because she was on that hustle. From what I've seen regarding Alinity, she didn't seem

10:33.460 --> 10:39.060
that bad. It seems there are many people who are worse. She also spoke openly about some of her

10:39.060 --> 10:44.500
mental health challenges, which is always content welcome on the platform. In a 2014 interview,

10:44.500 --> 10:49.860
she said she was inspired by people like Shakira, another Colombian who uses her body to express

10:49.860 --> 10:53.780
herself. It's an interesting discussion. If someone feels empowered by expressing

10:53.780 --> 10:57.140
themselves in that way, then who are we to tell them what they should be doing?

10:57.140 --> 11:01.780
Well, you see, the dispute isn't necessarily about what we think. In this instance,

11:01.780 --> 11:06.260
a lot of the criticism has been directed towards Twitch, who are known for their pretty harsh

11:06.260 --> 11:10.900
guidelines. I spoke earlier about the differences and similarities between YouTube and Twitch,

11:10.900 --> 11:15.380
and one of them is definitely how the rules are enforced. I mentioned Zoe Burger, a person who

11:15.380 --> 11:19.540
was arguably the most sexual out of the female streamers, well when she was ejected, she went

11:19.540 --> 11:23.780
to YouTube to play her video games, and they let her remain on the platform, although they

11:23.780 --> 11:28.580
did seem to eventually suppress her influence. Twitch have always imposed quite a strict

11:28.580 --> 11:33.140
criteria, yet this strict criteria has regularly been alleged to have been undermined by the

11:33.140 --> 11:37.620
behaviour of creators like Alinity and other female individuals that don't necessarily make

11:37.620 --> 11:41.780
their body the sole attraction for viewers, but certainly have it as a strong marketing point.

11:41.780 --> 11:46.260
It's walking the line on Twitch's policy for suggestive content. The greatest issue is that

11:46.260 --> 11:50.820
Twitch don't want to unfairly sanction creators, so normally it'd be good to side on the benefit

11:50.820 --> 11:55.060
of the doubt. However, if they don't act due to the benefit of the doubt, it might make the

11:55.060 --> 11:59.300
creators harder to control if they become established in the community. In Twitch's

11:59.300 --> 12:03.860
instance, their siding of the benefit of the doubt created a whole market for individuals

12:03.860 --> 12:07.620
who walked that line, and they could only intervene when someone stepped a bit more

12:07.620 --> 12:11.780
obviously out of line like Zoe Burger, and even then, they created drama which caught

12:11.780 --> 12:15.940
the attention of the whole community, and only pushed her counterparts further into the

12:15.940 --> 12:20.500
spotlights. However, it wasn't just directly from individuals like Zoe Burger who gained

12:20.500 --> 12:25.460
many people's attention. No, over the years, particularly 2016, another genre that came

12:25.460 --> 12:30.100
into light also caught people's attention, compilations. Compilations are when people

12:30.100 --> 12:34.340
combine selective clips that might highlight a certain behaviour. Now, on the one hand,

12:34.340 --> 12:38.420
compilations are very helpful for people, they can be more entertaining than watching the

12:38.420 --> 12:43.060
bare-boats content, and people might want to view these for a specific purpose. However,

12:43.060 --> 12:47.300
they can also be negative as they might provide people with the strengthened perception of what

12:47.300 --> 12:52.180
might be representative of a creator. In this instance, it gave many people the idea that a

12:52.180 --> 12:56.900
lot of these creators were very sexual in their behaviour. In these compilations was Alinity,

12:56.900 --> 13:01.540
occasionally known for her suggestive actions, finding herself a part of these compilations.

13:01.540 --> 13:05.220
Given that these compilations were also highlights, and therefore easier to watch,

13:05.460 --> 13:09.620
these videos caught on much more quickly, and moved these creators not just towards

13:09.620 --> 13:15.700
the more critical commentators, but also basic reaction commentators. But the reaction didn't stop there.

13:24.180 --> 13:28.260
The thing is, with the growth of this genre, Twitch placed themselves in a predicament.

13:28.260 --> 13:32.820
They knew what would happen if they tried to enact rules against these creators who themselves

13:32.820 --> 13:37.220
bring a lot of traffic to their site. Although they are definitely the superior streaming site,

13:37.220 --> 13:41.860
they don't want to lose the established creators to YouTube who have a framework themselves.

13:41.860 --> 13:46.740
Oh, and Mixer, you know, that site that just acquired Ninja, kind of a big deal. Nonetheless,

13:46.740 --> 13:51.460
normal creators and viewers don't have those vested interests, nor do they have to provide

13:51.460 --> 13:56.340
the benefit of the doubt to these streamers. This led to the rise in criticism that Twitch was not

13:56.340 --> 14:00.740
enforcing guidelines fairly. Also, given that these creators were all female, many people

14:00.740 --> 14:05.780
complained that Twitch was enforcing a gender bias. With the feeling of preferential treatment

14:05.780 --> 14:10.820
held by many creators, it began to lead to frustration, and even resentment towards the streamers.

14:10.820 --> 14:15.700
These people were using their body in a way that many people perceived they could not, because they

14:15.700 --> 14:20.020
would simply be banned. Therefore, given their treatment, it likely gave many people the feeling

14:20.020 --> 14:24.500
that there was a license to mock these creators without feeling that they were punching down.

14:24.500 --> 14:29.380
Numerous videos on these creators popped up, however, this did not lead to many consequences

14:29.380 --> 14:34.180
other than the reinforcement of the notion of what many called Twitch thoughts. And then came

14:34.180 --> 14:39.540
the PewDiePie video. The PewDiePie video that actually caused this controversy wasn't actually

14:39.540 --> 14:44.340
one that was really solely centered around reacting to a single compilation video. No,

14:44.340 --> 14:49.220
YouTube's then largest creator released a video in which he tested an eye-tracking device for various

14:49.220 --> 14:53.940
user-submitted clips. For a part of the video, he was reacting to streamer fail compilations,

14:53.940 --> 14:55.940
and then the fateful comments were made.

15:08.340 --> 15:12.740
Now this was not the point that the clips of Alinity were shown, in fact, the clip of

15:12.740 --> 15:18.420
Alinity was on briefly earlier in the video. In reacting to his video, Alinity confirms this.

15:24.820 --> 15:29.700
Yes, well done Alinity, it was you. Anyhow, she decided to continue watching, and although

15:29.700 --> 15:35.300
PewDiePie had not made the thought comment in direct reference to her clip, she felt it

15:35.300 --> 15:38.420
general enough to apply to her, and thus warranting a response.

15:54.500 --> 16:10.180
Now the term thought is an abbreviation for That Ho Over There, but however, before we have a

16:10.180 --> 16:15.540
discourse regarding this, it is important to emphasise that we speak the Queen's English here.

16:15.540 --> 16:21.540
We should not be using such petty slang as Ho is short for whore, which begins with a W. Therefore,

16:21.540 --> 16:26.980
in my opinion, the proper abbreviation will be Twot. Now, this is a term that isn't exclusive

16:26.980 --> 16:31.540
to Twitch, in fact, it seems to have yielded from hip-hop culture, although its origins aren't

16:31.540 --> 16:36.340
completely certain. Either way, it crossed into the Twitch sphere due to this sect of females who

16:36.340 --> 16:41.780
became infamous for their appearance and behaviour. Is it fair? Well, I mean with mine that this isn't

16:41.780 --> 16:46.820
a huge deal, I can understand why some people may be irked by the term. If someone is happy

16:46.820 --> 16:50.900
doing that with their body, then who are we to put them down? I guess the distinguishing factor

16:50.900 --> 16:56.180
between streamers like Alinity and Shakira is that it is a more direct interaction between

16:56.180 --> 17:01.060
the actual monetary support and what the person does with their body, not to mention that Shakira

17:01.060 --> 17:06.020
is a great singer too. I mean, of course, the definition of something like a twot is sexual

17:06.020 --> 17:10.980
promiscuity, and I can understand that being labelled that on the basis of compilations might

17:10.980 --> 17:16.020
be a bit of an annoyance, but PewDiePie doesn't really use the word in a malicious or harassing

17:16.020 --> 17:21.300
way, and therefore any more action than criticism and discourse would seem disproportionate.

17:21.300 --> 17:24.500
But let's see, does Alinity engage in criticism?

17:24.500 --> 17:31.220
Yo! Can we copy StrikePewDiePie's latest video? Like, right now?

17:31.220 --> 17:36.100
No, you can't copy StrikePewDiePie. Regardless of what he referred to you or your colleagues as,

17:36.100 --> 17:40.900
his content was fair use, and even if what he said pissed you off, a copyright strike was not

17:40.900 --> 17:46.260
the right way to respond. Why is it not then? Well, it's an act of grief, and although sometimes

17:46.260 --> 17:51.620
an act of grief may be necessary when dealing with a malicious actor, most people would not interpret

17:51.620 --> 17:57.540
PewDiePie as having been malicious enough to want any sort of response like that, as something like

17:57.540 --> 18:01.540
that would be a breach of the guidelines regardless. His comment was clearly meant to be

18:01.540 --> 18:06.660
facetious, he follows it with how they're gonna win over him, it's not the worst insult as insults go,

18:06.660 --> 18:12.020
and clearly not meant for literal interpretation. Alinity's reaction doesn't really stand legally,

18:12.020 --> 18:16.660
and it also doesn't stand morally. Unfortunately, even if conducted with a slightly more reserved

18:16.660 --> 18:21.380
mannerism than the previous behaviour she was known for, the same rather vicious sentiment

18:21.380 --> 18:26.420
remained. It felt like her attempt to fully suppress someone for using a term that she didn't

18:26.420 --> 18:32.820
like, and people identified that. It unnecessarily aggrieved him. And okay, sometimes people react

18:32.820 --> 18:37.540
disproportionately to certain things, doesn't mean they're bad people, they may just not be in the

18:37.540 --> 18:42.900
right mindset. However, the strangest thing is, even though she was calmer than I had previously

18:42.900 --> 18:48.340
found, in a way it made the whole clip feel worse. Rather than an uncontrolled outburst that a person

18:48.340 --> 18:53.860
might regret, it felt like someone's smugly excusing an act out of a spite. You can even see

18:53.860 --> 19:00.660
the slight grin on her face. It seemed like a dick move, and people don't like dicks, wait, you know

19:00.660 --> 19:04.660
what I mean? And although we shouldn't judge someone's mindset by their outward demeanour alone,

19:04.660 --> 19:10.020
that's the impression many people will have. That's how we interpret intent. To add to insult to

19:10.020 --> 19:14.020
injury, she then goes back to talk about how much money she makes from copyright strikes.

19:14.020 --> 19:19.060
But afterwards, she said very publicly that she earns a good living doing this kind of thing.

19:19.060 --> 19:26.020
A company. That's called Collab. And they are sending me, they're sending me $700 last month,

19:26.820 --> 19:30.100
from copy strike hitting people. Good money.

19:30.100 --> 19:33.220
Good money. Stealing money.

19:33.220 --> 19:37.220
Although she's clearly talking about a claim here, because you can't really make money off strikes,

19:37.220 --> 19:42.500
because they take the video down. Everything considered, this pissed people off, PewDiePie's

19:42.500 --> 19:47.940
fanbase included, and in case you weren't aware, PewDiePie has a pretty large fanbase. I'm sure

19:47.940 --> 19:53.140
Linety was aware of that, and of course PewDiePie was too. We saw him reacting disproportionately

19:53.140 --> 19:58.020
against a very large creator with a dedicated fanbase, it seemed that there was going to be

19:58.020 --> 20:03.620
quite a messy affair quickly, but what happened ended up being worse for Linety than possibly

20:03.620 --> 20:10.340
imagined. Have you heard of the phrase, kill them with kindness? Well honestly, it's overused,

20:10.340 --> 20:14.420
a lot of the time you will not be able to kill someone with kindness, because even when used

20:14.420 --> 20:18.500
metaphorically, you will typically sound sympathetic to the person you may be responding to,

20:18.500 --> 20:22.740
which will typically quell any drama and end up preventing harm done to either party,

20:22.740 --> 20:27.780
or it will make you look like you're being too nice to someone who is frankly rather unpleasant.

20:27.780 --> 20:32.660
However, there are times when it is applicable, and there are times when you can be kind.

20:32.660 --> 20:37.380
If you're in the right, and you're kind, and the person in the wrong reacts with hostility,

20:37.380 --> 20:42.660
oh god does it look bad. PewDiePie, in spite of his controversies and occasional poor ways of

20:42.660 --> 20:48.340
handling them, does understand the danger of a fired up fanbase, and how if instigated further

20:48.340 --> 20:52.820
could be attributed back to him. If handled wrong, PewDiePie might be accountable for a

20:52.820 --> 20:57.060
load of fans going ballistic on a female streamer's feed, which would not be a good

20:57.060 --> 21:01.540
look. As much as people are fired up about copyright, I'm sure he didn't want another

21:01.540 --> 21:06.180
Matt Hoth style court battle, the conflict would have ran much deeper, and wouldn't have been worth

21:06.180 --> 21:12.180
it. So what he did was remove the clip immediately, and chose not to contest it, that gave him a clear

21:12.180 --> 21:17.380
out of the drama. However, even with the clip removed, a copyright claim came in. Now this is

21:17.380 --> 21:22.180
where it becomes interesting, and confusing, because Collab DRM denied making the claim,

21:22.180 --> 21:26.500
and said that they had reviewed the video, and had deemed it fair use. However, PewDiePie looked

21:26.500 --> 21:32.260
at the claim, and reported to Franco that it was Collab DRM, who then made a very strange statement.

21:32.260 --> 21:36.340
I also reached out to Felix, who confirmed, yes it was claimed by Collab DRM, but also adding,

21:36.340 --> 21:39.940
I can't confirm if it was because of her clip or not. This of course, because Collab DRM has the

21:39.940 --> 21:43.380
policy of it's not their responsibility to tell you what portion of the video. He also sent me

21:43.380 --> 21:47.540
the email that he received from YouTube, confirming that Collab DRM did in fact claim his

21:47.540 --> 21:52.420
video. So it looks like it definitely did happen, but in Steve Bettinger's defense, separately,

21:52.420 --> 21:56.660
without me confronting with this information, he emailed me to slightly change his response,

21:56.660 --> 22:00.900
saying Collab DRM never issued a strike on the PewDiePie video you're referring to. We reviewed

22:00.900 --> 22:03.940
the video, and determined it to be fair use. Which I will say is confusing, because it seems

22:03.940 --> 22:08.180
that you're acknowledging that it was fair use. But now it appears definitively that the copyright

22:08.180 --> 22:12.260
claim did happen. It doesn't really seem to add up. Then three days later, PewDiePie uploaded a

22:12.260 --> 22:16.180
video where he states that although he wasn't sure that Alinity made the strike at first,

22:16.180 --> 22:21.620
she then took credit for it. Now, we weren't sure if it was Alinity that actually did the

22:21.620 --> 22:27.700
copy strike, or if it was just some random claim, because I get those all the time anyway,

22:27.700 --> 22:33.540
but the day after, she made a follow up to this, where she sort of boasted about, yeah,

22:34.260 --> 22:39.460
it was me guys. So, lots of confusion on the actual copyright claim front. However,

22:39.460 --> 22:43.860
there was little confusion from Alinity, who following pressure from people released

22:43.860 --> 22:48.980
another statement. This statement pinned the claim on the sexism within the streamer community,

22:48.980 --> 22:52.900
and the fact that PewDiePie's comment was the sort of thing that contributes to the harassment

22:52.900 --> 22:58.100
that many female streamers encounter on a daily basis. However, this hit an immediate roadblock.

22:58.100 --> 23:02.900
The problem was that this did not seem to be the instigating factor of the initial copyright claim,

23:02.900 --> 23:07.220
it didn't seem to be some emotional reaction spurred on by an instinctive response to

23:07.220 --> 23:11.380
misogyny. Paired with the comments made about her income, it seemed like an opportunity to

23:11.380 --> 23:16.820
use the comment as a scapegoat to make money, and no one, regardless of whether they have

23:16.820 --> 23:21.620
feminist sympathies or not, is going to be with you on that one. Although harassment would never

23:21.620 --> 23:27.060
be appropriate in that scenario, backlash from the situation has to fall somewhere at your feet

23:27.060 --> 23:32.420
for attempting to act outside what many would deem acceptable, you poked a sleeping line with

23:32.420 --> 23:36.740
a sharp stick. I think it is a relevant discussion, given how reductive many of the

23:36.740 --> 23:41.460
compilations are, how it might give off the wrong impression, but ultimately they are the largest

23:41.460 --> 23:45.700
contributors to it, and although PewDiePie understandably pledged to use the term more

23:45.700 --> 23:50.820
carefully in the future, the copyright claim is such a radical response it completely distracts

23:50.820 --> 23:55.860
from whatever discussion you might want to have regarding terminology. She also adds this rather

23:55.860 --> 24:00.260
unconvincing complaint at the end about objectification, and although I can understand

24:00.260 --> 24:04.900
why someone might be uncomfortable being labelled a twat, given the differences between taking dick

24:04.900 --> 24:10.740
from many men and behaving slightly sexually, I feel that Alinity has to be aware of the market

24:10.740 --> 24:16.020
that she appeals to, and how that might affect how people interpret her content. There's nothing

24:16.020 --> 24:20.820
wrong with people behaving in a sexual manner if that's what they feel empowers them, that's what

24:20.820 --> 24:26.900
people like Shakira did, and there's nothing wrong with taking issue with unnecessary sexualisation,

24:26.900 --> 24:31.860
but you can't have them both at the same time. However, the worst part comes when she shifts

24:31.860 --> 24:37.140
responsibility onto Collab DRM, who as representatives of the claimant, would have very little

24:37.140 --> 24:42.740
additional reason to claim a video that they recognise themselves as fair use. Alinity herself

24:42.740 --> 24:44.260
seems pretty ignorant.

24:44.260 --> 24:49.940
Alinity- I don't really know much about the laws, but I do know that I get money out of that. Like,

24:49.940 --> 24:55.780
it gives me money, so they do have to pay for it. Like, who's paying for that? I'm not really sure,

24:55.780 --> 25:01.620
but I'm guessing it's the content creator that is using my content on it. I honestly don't know how

25:01.620 --> 25:08.980
it works, but if I flag a channel, it gives me money. So, if anybody wants to use my content,

25:08.980 --> 25:13.300
just ask me, you know? And please don't misrepresent me, please don't call me names

25:13.300 --> 25:19.460
while using my content. It will get flagged by Collab, and I will get part of your, I don't know,

25:19.460 --> 25:21.620
your revenue for it, or whatever it's called.

25:21.620 --> 25:26.020
This is a terrible clip, but there has to be some irony in the fact that she clearly didn't

25:26.020 --> 25:30.820
seek permission to watch PewDiePie's video, yet feels that people should ask permission to react

25:30.820 --> 25:35.860
to compilations with her in. I find it hard to believe that she would be too stupid to not notice

25:35.860 --> 25:39.780
that contradiction, as did PewDiePie, and many other people.

25:39.780 --> 25:44.740
And I find this information to be completely redundant, because she said, I'm gonna claim the

25:44.740 --> 25:49.940
video, the video got claimed, and then finally she took credit for getting the video claimed.

25:49.940 --> 25:53.780
Then, because everyone fired back at her, suddenly the story is different,

25:53.780 --> 25:58.660
suddenly it's Collab's fault. Again, finally, Alinity, I'm sorry for calling you a twitch

25:58.660 --> 26:04.980
thot, I will definitely be careful with using that word in the future, but you need to stop

26:04.980 --> 26:10.500
blaming other people. Stop blaming Collab DRM, stop paying some sort of sexism narrative,

26:11.220 --> 26:17.380
stop blaming me, and admit that what you did was wrong. It's really not that hard.

26:17.380 --> 26:22.580
PewDiePie apologised, and ultimately by doing that, put Alinity in a position where she would

26:22.580 --> 26:28.660
be expected by many to apologise herself, or at least come to some resolution, but she didn't,

26:28.660 --> 26:33.700
and this is where PewDiePie killed her with kindness, because she didn't have a clue in

26:33.700 --> 26:39.540
how to actually respond, in fact her response was just further deflection onto her representatives,

26:39.540 --> 26:44.820
Collab DRM plus a load of waffle. The problem is that at this point, PewDiePie had taken

26:44.820 --> 26:49.620
responsibility for his side, so basically had nothing else to add, and therefore all the

26:49.620 --> 26:54.500
attention was thrown onto Alinity, who clearly was not well equipped to respond or even hold

26:54.500 --> 26:59.220
her own on these matters. The only way she could reverse the situation at that point was being able

26:59.220 --> 27:03.620
to act like there were additional incidents that PewDiePie needed to be held accountable for,

27:03.620 --> 27:08.180
which she definitely tried, she refused PewDiePie's apology, and then attempted to deepen her

27:08.180 --> 27:13.780
victimhood by focusing on the semantics regarding his comments. Semantics are important, however,

27:13.780 --> 27:18.900
PewDiePie's apology and explanation for why he said it satisfied enough people to just make

27:18.900 --> 27:22.660
Alinity look unreasonable and unnecessarily demanding.

27:22.660 --> 27:28.260
So for you to do all these things, right, and then for you to not accept my apology,

27:28.260 --> 27:36.740
when I said sorry, twice, what do you want? You're just digging yourself deeper and deeper,

27:36.740 --> 27:41.620
and I'm not even pushing at this point. And with people having this negative perception,

27:41.620 --> 27:47.060
people decided that it was time to start digging, and digging, and digging, and whatever Alinity

27:47.060 --> 27:52.420
was being framed as in PewDiePie's original video was nothing compared to what follows.

27:52.420 --> 27:57.620
Showing your underwear on stream, that's our fault, right? And then clicking on full screen

27:57.620 --> 28:02.660
right after. Bending over with your butt on camera, that's our fault, right? You're just

28:02.660 --> 28:08.420
looking at your butt hair in this video, not doing anything else. Eating a popsicle down your throat

28:08.420 --> 28:13.620
on camera, that's our fault, right? Because you had a sore in your mouth, that's why you did it,

28:13.620 --> 28:19.700
right? Oh, you're just playing games with the shortest skirt ever. That's our fault for having

28:19.700 --> 28:24.420
looking at it in any sexual way, right? Oh guys, I am just adjusting my camera right now,

28:24.420 --> 28:29.460
I'm completely unaware of what else is going on. If you have any sort of sexual intention towards

28:29.460 --> 28:35.140
this, that's our fault. Oh, sorry guys, I'm just pushing my bra together to show how a push-up

28:35.140 --> 28:40.580
bra works. That's your fault for seeing anything sexual in that. How dare you.

28:40.580 --> 28:45.140
Essentially, Alinity attempted to conduct a mud-slinging campaign against Felix,

28:45.140 --> 28:49.620
retweeting various negative tweets about him, which gave PewDiePie the impetus to bite back

28:49.620 --> 28:53.620
with his own claims. And remember that old clip about her not wanting to talk about her

28:53.620 --> 28:59.780
relationships? Oh dear, oh dear. There's this one clip where she very publicly admits to committing

28:59.780 --> 29:05.940
marriage fraud, that she moved to Colombia and married this guy, just so she could move

29:05.940 --> 29:12.740
to Canada. You don't make any money, you work a lot. So I was like, no, hell no. So I married

29:12.740 --> 29:21.060
a Canadian, and they came to Canada, and then I divorced them. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

29:21.060 --> 29:26.420
Unfortunately, Alinity was outnumbered, both numerically and logically, and somehow became

29:26.420 --> 29:31.460
the single greatest target and villain at the same time. How do you manage something like that?

29:31.460 --> 29:36.580
Surely if you are the target, people will at least give you some sympathy. Well.

29:44.100 --> 29:49.460
When reflecting on a situation, we are typically sympathetic to people who become targets of the

29:49.460 --> 29:54.420
internet mob. Not because they haven't committed any wrongdoings, but because eventually you

29:54.420 --> 29:59.620
reflect on it and wonder how much of the drama they actually instigated, and how many people

29:59.620 --> 30:04.420
were just blindly hating them without asking any questions. However, with this situation,

30:04.420 --> 30:08.980
there has been very little sympathy in any reflection, and this is mainly because Alinity,

30:08.980 --> 30:13.460
despite receiving backlash from the fanbase of one of the largest creators on the platform,

30:13.460 --> 30:18.980
managed to instigate almost every single instance. When you throw something at a person,

30:18.980 --> 30:23.540
they might see it as giving them license to fling back, and this is exactly what happened

30:23.540 --> 30:28.500
with Alinity. She tried to punch below the belt by talking about PewDiePie's other controversies,

30:28.500 --> 30:33.620
and PewDiePie spoke about her other controversies with much greater impact. There are a few reasons

30:33.620 --> 30:38.420
that this yielded much more impact. Firstly, PewDiePie has a greater fanbase, but also a

30:38.420 --> 30:43.700
much greater social media presence all in all. Alinity, in spite of her following on Twitch,

30:43.700 --> 30:49.060
only had around 67,000 Twitter followers at the time of the controversy, which is slightly low

30:49.060 --> 30:54.900
compared to PewDiePie's then 16 million followers. Let's just say this led to some ratios.

30:54.900 --> 30:58.740
It also didn't help that PewDiePie has been the centre of attention for ages, and therefore

30:58.740 --> 31:03.220
nothing that people said was actually news to anyone, and therefore he wasn't being really

31:03.220 --> 31:07.940
exposed other than through trivial rumours. Alinity, on the other hand, as a streamer who

31:07.940 --> 31:12.820
hasn't been involved in a drama that size, has all this dirty laundry that many people

31:12.820 --> 31:16.580
haven't seen go through the watch, and when people brought it into the light,

31:16.660 --> 31:21.940
it was news, and was pretty damn bad. This led to her becoming one of the internet's least

31:21.940 --> 31:26.340
favourite people, and when confronted regarding this, she once again flipped responsibility of

31:26.340 --> 31:43.460
her comments to people reporting her to the authorities, and although I probably wouldn't

31:43.460 --> 31:47.700
advise reporting her, in spite of the evidence, you know, people chat their shit to try and

31:47.700 --> 31:52.500
embolden themselves in front of their audience, it's hard to feel sympathetic to her complaints.

31:52.500 --> 31:57.140
Bragging about a crime in which there is a victim will never be overwhelmingly popular when people

31:57.140 --> 32:01.540
look at it with a critical eye. PewDiePie did have a lot of responsibility in the handling of

32:01.540 --> 32:05.700
the situation, which could have been misused greatly, however many people would agree that

32:05.700 --> 32:09.540
he should be able to argue his case as well, particularly in response to anything that

32:09.540 --> 32:14.260
Alinity says, and because he was constantly on the retaliation, this gave him the opportunity

32:14.260 --> 32:19.620
to know what Alinity had said and respond with more impact. Another huge issue was that Alinity

32:19.620 --> 32:24.820
just went from one argument to another, basically taking consecutive L's on every single perspective,

32:24.820 --> 32:27.540
her points of view were just an incoherent mess.

32:39.540 --> 32:48.980
She continuously argued the notion of responsibility, while taking none of her own.

32:48.980 --> 32:54.020
PewDiePie continuously offered a ceasefire, and she rejected it, maybe because she thought if

32:54.020 --> 32:58.660
the harassment became bad enough, it would help make a case for her victimhood, however because

32:58.660 --> 33:03.780
she was seen as instigating every fan defending PewDiePie or attacking her, was seen to be doing

33:03.780 --> 33:08.260
it because of her own statements, rather than because of anything PewDiePie actually said or

33:08.260 --> 33:13.220
did. To add to this, the only real point of view that she could argue herself as aggrieved on was

33:13.220 --> 33:18.500
the perspective of sexism, now in a way you could argue that the gender perspective could give her

33:18.500 --> 33:23.700
a hard time, there is a lot of prejudice, but as said, many people would suspect that actually her

33:23.700 --> 33:28.420
gender gave her an advantage, especially on Twitch, particularly given the genre that she had

33:28.420 --> 33:32.100
rose to prominence in. And then, to top it all off, she just said this,

33:53.220 --> 33:57.460
And this irritated a lot of people, because as mentioned earlier, everyone knows about how

33:57.460 --> 34:01.860
Twitch treat many streamers, how harshly they enforce many of their guidelines, to have this

34:01.860 --> 34:07.380
person breach the same terms of service and not face any consequences at all was enraging, and

34:07.380 --> 34:12.180
undermined any argument of disenfranchisement coming from her. Throughout it all, she delivered

34:12.180 --> 34:17.060
her words with the same very dispassionate tone, and although it's important that you don't let

34:17.060 --> 34:21.300
your emotions interfere with your points of view too much, because her arguments seemed emotionally

34:21.300 --> 34:26.260
based, when paired with her delivery, it just seemed very uncomfortable, and plain manipulative

34:26.260 --> 34:33.620
for many people. I felt very upset. This has upset me a lot. She always has a trend of continuously

34:33.620 --> 34:38.660
attacking people's previous prejudices as a way to deflect current criticism, and although people

34:38.660 --> 34:43.380
may be harsher on her, for sure, it doesn't mean she is above the criticism. Later on in the same

34:43.380 --> 34:47.700
stream, she used people's least favourite racial slur, the one beginning with the letter N of

34:47.700 --> 34:52.020
course, and once again, although not the most malicious manner given Twitch's extremely harsh

34:52.020 --> 34:56.980
enforcement of the guidelines, and the context of it being in the same stream, this irritated a lot

34:56.980 --> 35:01.540
of people, and further elevated how untouchable she seemed to perceive herself as.

35:01.540 --> 35:03.780
You coming not saying that ever again? Okay.

35:06.660 --> 35:11.220
Well, I'm part black, so I don't see why the- like, why would they say that?

35:12.100 --> 35:16.900
Well, I wouldn't say- I'm like 10% black, I don't think I- whatever.

35:16.900 --> 35:19.940
Did she just use the Keemstar defence? Oh no.

35:20.020 --> 35:25.620
This does not seem good. You'd find very few neutral actors who defend her behaviour at this point.

35:25.620 --> 35:31.700
But wait, there was one more publication willing to stand up against PewDiePie. Wait, no, nevermind

35:31.700 --> 35:36.100
it's vice. I did actually respond to this article briefly last year in a video about Mr. Beast.

35:36.100 --> 35:40.980
To sum it up, it's really bad and arguably one of the worst cases of decontextualisation there has

35:40.980 --> 35:45.940
been for a while. Although the concern of making sure that you do not frame any victim as asking

35:45.940 --> 35:50.500
for it is a concern that we should all pay attention to, I do not think the slippery slope

35:50.500 --> 35:55.060
from Felix's comments were there. And yes, for some reason, having the backing of a mainstream

35:55.060 --> 36:00.260
outlet wasn't a huge support winner. Alinity was being attacked on nearly every platform,

36:00.260 --> 36:04.580
and her support just wasn't following through to many corners of the internet.

36:04.580 --> 36:09.620
However, she never backed down. Why wouldn't she? Let's ask that question.

36:16.820 --> 36:24.420
When someone becomes involved in drama, one of the most constraining factors ultimately comes

36:24.420 --> 36:30.180
down to your audience. I spoke about it right at the start. When UI twitched Dreamer, whose appeal

36:30.180 --> 36:35.780
is partly your appearance, decorum is a liberty, and Alinity recognised that. Normally when you

36:35.780 --> 36:40.180
encounter drama where you receive substantial amounts of criticism, you would lose support.

36:40.180 --> 36:44.820
But if you head over to Alinity's social blade, you'll see that her growth was largely unaffected

36:44.820 --> 36:50.260
by the drama. That was exactly the same with Pokimane 2. Despite being criticised by the

36:50.260 --> 36:55.620
commentators very harshly, when it came down to the numbers, there was very little change.

36:55.620 --> 37:00.420
Therefore, if she didn't actually feel like apologising, well, she had very little to lose

37:00.420 --> 37:05.620
by not. She's in drama with someone who, in spite of their prominence, can't really cause any damage

37:05.620 --> 37:10.180
to the channel or the income that she's receiving, partly due to the fact that she's on Twitch,

37:10.180 --> 37:14.580
and partly because her appeal is separate from her credibility. No one expected her

37:14.580 --> 37:18.980
to be the voice of reason, although many people would agree Twitch should be treating people

37:18.980 --> 37:24.340
equally. Unfortunately, that's not how it works, and as sad as it is, the drama isn't the greatest

37:24.340 --> 37:29.700
deal in the grand scheme of things. She had who she needed to on her side, who derived benefit

37:29.700 --> 37:34.420
from her entertainment that isn't compromised by the drama, and therefore they want to keep

37:34.420 --> 37:39.940
watching her. This gave her license to basically behave how she wanted to, and she did. However,

37:39.940 --> 37:44.900
there was one thing that was separate to her fanbase, and that was the other source of support

37:44.900 --> 37:49.620
that was indispensable for her, Twitch themselves. Many people have argued that Twitch should have

37:49.620 --> 37:54.340
punished Alinity for her conduct, yet Twitch haven't, and it appeared that she had them in

37:54.340 --> 37:59.860
her back pocket, and once the drama died down, most people have no reason to persist. There were

37:59.860 --> 38:05.540
more pressing dramas that caught people's interest, and the online community isn't exactly known for

38:05.540 --> 38:10.660
their attention span. However, there was one thing that would last, the impression that she left on

38:10.660 --> 38:15.620
many people. Impressions aren't important if we never have to come into contact with them again,

38:15.620 --> 38:20.340
and for a good year we didn't. There was a brief situation at the end of the year where she accused

38:20.340 --> 38:26.420
another streamer of sexual harassment, and provided some corroborating screenshots. The other streamer

38:26.420 --> 38:30.740
openly denied these claims, and retained a lawyer. People would have been foolish to drag her over

38:30.740 --> 38:35.780
this because they are quite serious, and it seems that it's still an open case, but there have been

38:35.780 --> 38:41.060
no updates since around November last year, so I guess we'll just wait on that one. However, it was

38:41.060 --> 38:46.740
not the end of community run-ins with Alinity, and everything that had happened in the past would now

38:46.740 --> 38:51.780
come back to bite her. In the past, many people had accused Alinity of throwing her pussy around.

38:52.420 --> 38:56.820
However, few would have been able to call how literal this phrase would be applied, because on

38:56.820 --> 39:03.140
the 18th of June 2019, Alinity was doing what she normally does on Twitch, streaming, and her cat

39:03.140 --> 39:10.020
obstructed her gamer view, and like any sane normal human being, you don't let the pets get in the way.

39:10.020 --> 39:15.460
She responded by taking the cat, and throwing it over her head fairly abruptly. This clip began to

39:15.460 --> 39:19.620
spread throughout the internet, and like the internet, they then found more clips regarding

39:19.620 --> 39:25.380
Alinity, and her cat, and her other pets, including this very charming one where she decides that her

39:25.380 --> 39:30.420
cat's in the mood for a cheeky drink, a nice cocktail of vodka and saliva. It then hit reporters

39:30.420 --> 39:36.260
like Keemstar, and then PETA, the controversial animal rights group with questionable hot takes.

39:36.260 --> 39:41.300
However, the take this time was pretty al dente. They were not satisfied with Alinity's behaviour,

39:41.300 --> 39:47.140
and they wanted Twitch to take action. Like Mount Vesuvius, the dormant community erupted into a

39:47.140 --> 39:52.020
united call of criticism. This was really the perfect opportunity, because there was no way that

39:52.100 --> 39:57.460
Alinity could put the blame on the cat, and therefore there was no defined enemy for Alinity

39:57.460 --> 40:02.340
to victimise herself against. In light of these claims and the corroborating footage, her local

40:02.340 --> 40:08.100
animal protection society launched an investigation into her contact with the animal, and it was not

40:08.100 --> 40:14.260
looking good for her. So what does she do? Well, she did the unthinkable, she apologised.

40:16.580 --> 40:21.780
In these tweets, she apologises for her quote lapses in judgement, and commits to complying

40:21.780 --> 40:27.540
with any animal abuse investigation, while stating that her cats do live in a loving environment.

40:27.540 --> 40:32.180
This could have been over, this could have been it, but people weren't prepared to let it go,

40:32.180 --> 40:36.820
and it was even less likely to have been let go when Twitch decided that they weren't going to

40:36.820 --> 40:42.100
take any action at all. On first glance, maybe a warning would suffice, but new evidence came

40:42.100 --> 40:46.820
forward regarding Twitch's treatment of streamers. One clip regarding another streamer who went by

40:46.820 --> 40:52.500
the name of Bebe, who was seemingly banned for 14 days following a similar incident in which she

40:52.500 --> 40:57.940
tossed a cat over her head. She put out a statement regarding this hypocrisy where she seems to confirm

40:57.940 --> 41:02.660
that a temporary ban was placed on her. This video comparison relating to it then spread fairly

41:02.660 --> 41:08.500
quickly, and caused further outrage among critics. Then the videos came, they came fast, and they came

41:08.500 --> 41:13.780
hard. Harping on Alinity for her behaviour and her privilege, and attacking Twitch for their double

41:13.780 --> 41:18.660
standards, there was not really much defending to be done, and although some people had actually

41:18.660 --> 41:23.860
defended her actions, few people could actually defend Twitch if they gave her another pass,

41:23.860 --> 41:28.180
especially with all her previous actions and comments that Twitch is giving her exemptions

41:28.180 --> 41:33.060
from any actual retribution. People are reaching the stage where they ask how much more would a

41:33.060 --> 41:38.260
person like Alinity need to do to actually see any action taken against her. The weird thing is,

41:38.260 --> 41:42.100
I don't think this would have been a huge controversy if she'd never been involved in

41:42.100 --> 41:46.660
the controversies in the previous year. And in a way, if you're a stubborn person, it might feel

41:46.660 --> 41:51.700
better to stand your ground, even if everyone hates you. If you can retain your fan base while

41:51.700 --> 41:56.900
still being a little belligerent, then it might feel validating. However, when your future relies

41:56.900 --> 42:01.300
on the fact that you're walking the line between what might be acceptable and what might not be,

42:01.300 --> 42:07.780
then people will obviously see these situations as an opportunity to call on you to face repercussions,

42:07.780 --> 42:12.820
and those calls will not go away. Nonetheless, there is also inside information that we might

42:12.820 --> 42:17.540
not be aware of. One of Twitch's heads of media put out a tweet where they stated that they were

42:17.540 --> 42:21.860
in favour of Alinity's suspension from the platform for a certain amount of time, but

42:21.860 --> 42:27.300
ultimately had no authority to make that call, which was, to be frank, rather concerning. On top

42:27.300 --> 42:32.340
of this, much like the racial slur she had made, this was no longer talking about suggestive

42:32.340 --> 42:38.100
behaviour that made her and others popular. This was unambiguous. This is not something that they

42:38.100 --> 42:43.860
would have set any standard for other streamers in the genre. This is a blatant exception made by

42:43.860 --> 42:48.820
Twitch, and the fact that she's the beneficiary of this has only made her more unpopular.

42:48.820 --> 42:50.980
How bad is it? Let's have a discussion.

42:50.980 --> 43:02.660
When someone commits a wrongdoing, we like to see them held accountable for their actions.

43:02.660 --> 43:07.220
It's a simple enough notion, and when we feel like they have paid their dues, then we might be open

43:07.220 --> 43:12.420
to not hating them anymore, depending on their conduct and how they feel about it. Sometimes,

43:12.420 --> 43:17.460
if an authority fails to take action, we might hate the authority more than the actual person.

43:17.460 --> 43:22.340
In this instance, if this had been an isolated incident, it might be a scenario of hating the

43:22.340 --> 43:27.060
game rather than the player. However, with the fact that Alinity had openly admitted to being

43:27.060 --> 43:32.420
on somewhat chummy relationships with the Twitch authority, it basically made her part of the game

43:32.420 --> 43:38.100
that many people absolutely loathe. Alinity isn't ignorant of what she's doing, she's completely

43:38.100 --> 43:43.140
knowledgeable of the privilege that she has obtained, and in many ways highly indulgent

43:43.140 --> 43:47.700
of it, provoking breaches of the guidelines that she must be aware of. On one stream,

43:47.700 --> 43:52.900
she takes a picture of her buttocks, with the camera shot reflecting onto the stream.

43:52.900 --> 43:56.980
No action was taken. In two other streams, she was reported to bring up porn on the screen,

43:56.980 --> 44:01.700
however these were accidental, so she was let off, which is fair enough, but still something

44:01.700 --> 44:06.180
to take note of, and when called out on this treatment, she is regularly attempted to make

44:06.180 --> 44:11.780
herself the victim, from her position, and although the stereotypical branding of a twat I can

44:11.780 --> 44:17.380
understand might irks on, and even put them down in a way, it feels like a small drawback in a role

44:17.380 --> 44:22.500
that is clearly derived due to many benefits of the market, and many benefits of the doubt,

44:22.500 --> 44:26.900
that many would agree you do not deserve. Honestly, if Twitch punished her at this point,

44:26.900 --> 44:31.460
she might catch a bit less flak in the future, but because Twitch have failed to take action

44:31.460 --> 44:36.740
in the past, people will now be looking for reasons to campaign for her suspension on the platform.

44:36.740 --> 44:41.620
Now there are two reasons why this may not matter to Alinity, first one being if she completely

44:41.620 --> 44:46.340
avoids these controversies in the future, now this is slightly doubtful given her record of

44:46.340 --> 44:51.300
controversies, and how abrasive she seems to be, whether by impulse or calculation, she does seem

44:51.300 --> 44:55.620
to annoy people, and on top of this, whenever something occurs, it seems to provoke another

44:55.620 --> 44:59.700
wave of people searching for other related incidents that piles on pressure for Twitch to

44:59.700 --> 45:04.740
take action, so I doubt this will be the last time we hear of her. The second condition is that Twitch

45:04.740 --> 45:10.260
actually are so tight with Alinity, they will never take any action no matter what. I think

45:10.340 --> 45:14.980
this is a more plausible condition, but it would certainly depend on the extent that Alinity pushes

45:14.980 --> 45:19.620
the boundaries, the only rational reason that I perceive they keep people like her on the site

45:19.620 --> 45:24.420
during these incidents is due to the possible prospect of encouraging competition. Obviously,

45:24.420 --> 45:28.980
that excludes other theories like deep personal connections or possible blackmail, although the

45:28.980 --> 45:33.060
evidence that there is some deeper link is quite compelling in itself, given that many streamers

45:33.060 --> 45:37.060
have reported that they've been banned for talking about the incident alone, and there are many

45:37.060 --> 45:41.540
rumours and claims that there does seem to be some coherence to. The question is, when a competitor

45:41.540 --> 45:46.100
comes along, and people can judge a platform on the basis of morality rather than practicality,

45:46.100 --> 45:51.140
who will Twitch back? I do wonder how much longer it'd take for Twitch to feel like they've been

45:51.140 --> 45:55.860
losing more than they're gaining from keeping Alinity on the platform without any punishment.

45:55.860 --> 46:01.140
Honestly, when you do nothing, it's hard to get people to boycott your platform, but this

46:01.140 --> 46:06.100
animal maltreatment thing seems to be the closest she's ever been to actually being impacted by

46:06.100 --> 46:10.740
controversy, and even then she's remained in the green because people don't feel bad supporting

46:10.740 --> 46:15.460
someone whose appeal isn't inextricably linked to how they treat animals, and unfortunately,

46:15.460 --> 46:20.340
the fact that her audience nor Twitch is prepared to react, she'll probably continue to behave

46:20.340 --> 46:25.780
recklessly. Now, to be fair, if the authorities who are investigating this animal maltreatment case

46:25.780 --> 46:32.020
give her a bit of a scare, wait no, never mind, if the authority finds this, then I can't act as if

46:32.020 --> 46:38.020
I have a greater insight to the home life of a cat, but I don't really understand how they can

46:38.020 --> 46:45.140
say this didn't have quote malicious intent, while throwing a cat over the head, or spitting vodka,

46:45.140 --> 46:51.620
like okay, she didn't intend to cause any harm, but it's still reckless and stupid, and a bad thing

46:51.620 --> 46:56.900
to do on screen. I don't think that was the point that people were trying to make, and you know

46:56.900 --> 47:01.300
what? I don't want to see her lose her pets over these incidents, I think that would be a

47:01.300 --> 47:06.740
disproportionate reaction, but as reports go, you really downplay the instance, I mean you don't

47:06.740 --> 47:12.340
even say what they were, I'm not gonna give her stick if Alinity pledges to treat her pets better,

47:12.340 --> 47:17.380
and I do believe she has the capacity to, even if it's just for the sake of protecting her career,

47:17.380 --> 47:21.300
but it's important that people are actually informed of what a person has done, so they

47:21.300 --> 47:25.540
can judge it from an informed perspective, but regardless of how she treats her pets,

47:25.540 --> 47:30.260
when it comes to treating commentators and other creators who may give her criticism,

47:30.260 --> 47:35.700
particularly audiences, Alinity sees no consequence from being defensive, abrasive,

47:35.700 --> 47:40.100
and confrontational, so chances are when these situations transpire in the future, she will

47:40.100 --> 47:45.540
continue to be that way, she has no motivation to change, and until she does that, she will be that

47:45.540 --> 47:51.700
way, and I mean ultimately being rather unpleasant doesn't preface you not being right, you could be

47:51.700 --> 47:56.820
unpleasant, and completely right, it's just Alinity wasn't, in my opinion she has been

47:56.820 --> 48:02.100
completely wrong, and her doubling down on it has only been done out of personal pride, where there

48:02.100 --> 48:06.420
are any behavioural causes that play into it, whether her mental health may be involved is

48:06.420 --> 48:11.700
another question, but regardless, her actions and responses to criticism give off the impression

48:11.700 --> 48:16.660
that she does not understand the responsibility that she has misused as a public figure, and thus

48:16.660 --> 48:20.980
does attract rightful criticism from the basis that she might hurt someone else again due to

48:20.980 --> 48:26.020
that lack of understanding. As for Twitch, I think they should have taken action against her,

48:26.020 --> 48:30.340
given all the liberties they permit, however this seems to be a constant problem with all

48:30.340 --> 48:34.980
larger platforms, that anyone with significant clout receives special treatment, while people

48:34.980 --> 48:39.780
at the bottom are constantly being weeded out by the moderators, everyone's been the victim of that

48:39.780 --> 48:44.180
unfortunately, although I really do question what they would have lost by temporarily banning

48:44.180 --> 48:49.460
Alinity this time round, it's not really related to the market or a standard that you might set,

48:49.460 --> 48:54.500
having a rule for not throwing cats seems fair enough, and I really doubt many people would have

48:54.500 --> 48:59.860
sided with animal cruelty, and I really doubt that Alinity would have been able to rile up a narrative

48:59.860 --> 49:05.860
of injustice, or move a majority of the market over to a competing platform, YouTube isn't quite

49:05.860 --> 49:10.820
equipped enough to win over a lot of the Twitch streamers, and Alinity doesn't seem like a person

49:10.820 --> 49:16.260
with a huge influence over other Twitch names, it does really make me wonder why if there's

49:16.260 --> 49:21.140
something a bit more personal going on, it would not surprise me, either way Twitch's continuous

49:21.140 --> 49:25.860
protection of Alinity with no repercussion at all will continue to rub people the wrong way,

49:25.860 --> 49:30.020
and the fact that Alinity is very aware of it will make her much more contemptible for people

49:30.020 --> 49:35.060
who observe these situations. As for the viewers, there will be many people who unconditionally

49:35.060 --> 49:40.420
support her, I have a hunch that there are also many people who acknowledge her character slightly

49:40.420 --> 49:45.140
flawed, but enjoy her content nonetheless, and that will continue unless she does something

49:45.140 --> 49:51.460
really really bad, but I don't think she would go that far. And what about me, her critic?

49:51.460 --> 49:57.140
All these critics? Well, once upon a time, the hatred she may have received may have been due to

49:57.140 --> 50:03.060
the sneering elitism towards the type of audience she appealed to, however, five years on, and she

50:03.060 --> 50:08.020
has given people many additional reasons to dislike her. At this point, there can be little doubt that

50:08.020 --> 50:12.500
Alinity's position of privilege, pride, and pernition has made her one of the most unpopular

50:12.500 --> 50:17.380
persons on the platform, but as long as she's on that platform, people are powerless, and damn

50:17.380 --> 50:22.980
right she knows it. But there's one thing guaranteed, they will be waiting. So that was

50:22.980 --> 50:29.780
the video, I hope you really enjoyed it, I had fun, a lot of fun, this was a long one, but sometimes

50:29.780 --> 50:36.260
they need to be long to revisit all these ideas. I'd love to give a big shout out to the editors,

50:36.260 --> 50:42.180
once again, I'm sure they did a great job, I could never understate that. I'm really looking

50:42.180 --> 50:46.260
forward to seeing the finished product, and go and check them out and send them some love on that

50:46.260 --> 50:52.340
behalf. I need to give a big shout out to my Patreons, the $10 Patreons plus are on screen

50:52.340 --> 50:58.180
right now, but I do have some special, special people that I need to give a special, special

50:58.180 --> 51:06.740
shout out to. These Patreons include my $50 Patreons, Caroline, Nico Deschamps, Rocket Ralph,

51:06.740 --> 51:14.820
Sarah Elizabeth, Sumhala Baloo, and the Specter Angel. Three, $300 Patreons, Brandon Junck,

51:14.820 --> 51:21.060
Adam Michael, and Christopher Karrasz. It's a very nice name, Christopher Karrasz. I think Christopher

51:21.060 --> 51:26.260
Karrasz is the newest Patreon, so welcome to the crew, we've got a nice little entourage pulling up

51:26.260 --> 51:31.700
right now that I'm very proud of, and I appreciate all the support you guys give. If you want to

51:31.700 --> 51:38.580
reach me, you can contact me on Twitter, at The Right Opinion, Facebook too, I've also got a Discord,

51:38.580 --> 51:43.060
all the links to those will be in the pinned comments if you want to follow them there.

51:43.060 --> 51:47.940
Otherwise, I don't think I have too much else to add, I hope you guys are doing well as always,

51:47.940 --> 51:54.340
and I do hope you have a lovely, lovely day. Take care my friends, I'm The Right Opinion,
