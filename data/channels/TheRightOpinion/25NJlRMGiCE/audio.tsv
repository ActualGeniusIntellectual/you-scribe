0	11800	Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
11800	15620	too much free time, and Twitch streamers, a unique brand of crater.
15620	18720	We've spoken about them a few times on this channel, but there's always new corners
18720	23540	to explore, and as always, that's what we'll be doing today, we'll be invading Twitch
23540	27200	from the sidelines of YouTube, because Twitch and YouTube, although having a lot of crater
27200	31480	overlap, also have very different dynamics, which is why there are people who use both
31480	32480	platforms.
32480	34840	In a way, it seems there is a mutual understanding.
34840	38640	Twitch understand that they probably can't compete with YouTube's upload features,
38640	42680	and YouTube, although attempting to have their own stream assets, know that Twitch's specialised
42680	45440	setup is a bit more of a step up from their own.
45440	49880	Twitch and YouTube, however, due to that overlap, will have somewhat similar audiences, and
49880	54000	that means that you can typically expect that you will find some underlying commonalities
54000	58480	in the popular content craters, one of those markets being attractive females.
58480	63080	Now being an attractive female does not predispose you to success, but in the glorious society
63080	67400	that we live in, many younger individuals, and slightly older individuals, feel excitement
67400	69580	from viewing people who may be attractive.
69580	74080	Probably the YouTube embodiment of this crater is SS SnipeWolf, you know, that person who
74080	78280	won a gaming award even though she barely games, and she switched her reaction commentary
78280	82720	ages ago, you know, she flossed, and although I can't say for sure, my judgement deemed
82720	86360	it lacking the sufficient irony to be classed as remotely humorous.
86360	91600	She's also doing very little gusto, I want more effort next time, SS SnipeWolf.
91600	96240	Now I don't doubt that she has a great business mind, I mean, you kinda have to when you've
96240	100960	been a criminal, but as a curator, her work does sometimes leave a lot to be desired.
100960	121680	This is what I class as the sort of attractive female content, and I'm not saying that obviously
121680	126660	this is the sole prerequisite, there's a reason I haven't started doing facecam content yet,
126660	130600	and it's clear that it's good clickbait that might grab external audiences, but in the
130600	135800	core fanbase, well yeah, you can note some trends, the various moods after winning the
135800	141240	award, congrats Leah, you deserve the award from our wolf pack support, you look gorgeous,
141240	147360	the ceremony, by the way, hearty eyes, hearty eyes, fire, fire, and then 4 pictures, but
147360	149520	I guess she looks gorgeous in all of them.
149520	154200	So yes, SS SnipeWolf may be the best example of the exploitation of that sort of appeal,
154200	158840	however very few people necessarily see her reflective of YouTube's cultural landscape,
158840	162840	in spite of the significant views she pulls, and the number of times she ends up on YouTube's
162840	166720	trending. If I was to say, women of YouTube, people would probably come up with a variety
166720	172560	of answers, Lele Pons, Jenna Marbles, Lilly Singh, etc, etc, etc.
172560	176780	If you asked any standard creator about the women of Twitch, however, well you'd probably
176780	180660	hear an answer that encapsulates one of the more notorious genres. The word that some
180660	185520	people like to use is thot, but here on the right opinion, we are respectful of women,
185520	189760	and being a ladies man has given me ample training for that. It's strange because there
189760	193960	are a variety of female Twitch streamers, but ultimately the perception has been tainted
193960	197520	by the existence of many things, including the commentator.
197520	203440	Oh Twitch girls, the crème de la crème of online content.
203440	209000	One thing that transcends platforms is the existence of irritating commentators, who
209000	214080	have opinions on everything, damn people with opinions, who would dare have those? Now I
214080	218040	don't mean the commentators are on Twitch necessarily, I mean heaven forbid what would
218040	221360	happen if that was the case, but in the last couple years, because of the market, people
221360	225240	have gone after the brand of Twitch streamer that is at the centre of attention today,
225240	229600	and has definitely put them at the forefront of Twitch's image for better and for worse.
229600	233420	Why though? Well a lot of streamers like that have always existed on the platform, but the
233420	238080	image really became synonymous with the rise of people like Zoe Burger, who not just became
238080	242580	infamous for that behaviour, but also crossed the line over to the YouTube sphere thus garnering
242580	246900	the attention of many commentators at that time. Although Zoe Burger's fame was short
246900	251300	lived, the attention persisted, and eventually many female streamers became pretty popular
251300	256020	amongst commentary circles on YouTube as well. Ultimately this created a cycle, and the commentary
256020	259100	that we witness today is a byproduct of that.
259100	264900	However, people being popular is an interesting concept on its own, because as a popular creator,
264900	268940	there is always a level of accountability to one's audience that a creator should feel.
268940	273620	Nonetheless, the level of inherent accountability is often based off the appeal of the creator.
273620	277560	I've spoken about this before, so I won't linger on it too much.
277560	280740	Commentators and streamers have clashed on a few occasions, probably the most notable
280740	285580	one earlier this year was when Pokimane was called out by PewDiePie, and some other creators
285580	290300	for some rather poor behaviour. She did actually respond to it, and was quite involved in drama
290300	294580	following the situation, however one thing that she did attempt to do was engage with
294580	299620	the other side, and not be combative. However, being pleasant is more of a liberty when your
299620	303420	appeal is based off something not related to your direct demeanour, and that brings
303420	304740	us to Alinity.
304740	310120	Alinity, also known as Alinity Divine, is a 31 year old creator residing in Canada,
310120	314660	although she was initially born and raised in Colombia. She began streaming in 2012,
314660	320300	and over the years has built a follower base of over 930,000. Not something to be jeered
320300	326540	against. Her content consists of gaming streams and videos, discussion and some physical activities.
326540	330700	This obviously makes some of the viewers very satisfied on browsing her recent clips, I
330700	335620	picked one named Six, which was a rather innocent video involving her dog, however the thumbnail
335620	341500	had been picked fairly carefully, and it was not a wonder that this was her second most
341500	343060	viewed clip of recent.
343060	346940	For a long time, Alinity was just another female streamer doing her thing, but in the
346940	351100	last couple of years something changed, a run of incidents that left her at odds with
351100	355860	many people, particularly the commentator, escalating most recently with many people
355860	361660	calling for her removal from the platform due to the treatment of her cat. However,
361660	366460	if this was the only incident, would people really be calling for her termination? Well,
366460	371680	I think we should find out. Today I want to discuss exactly how Alinity came to fame,
371680	376360	how she came to notoriety, and exactly what led people up to the point where many think
376360	380880	that she has to be stopped. It's a long story, but I assume you're ready, because
380880	382840	you've got this far. Let's go.
389480	394680	Alinity has been streaming for almost seven years. Now, it is difficult to find any comprehensive
394680	397840	history, however we can look at the growth of her channel, and one thing that struck
397840	403320	me was that, providing the information I found was accurate, her growth came pretty instantaneously.
403320	407320	She streamed every day for four to eight hours, with the main goal to raise the monies
407320	411900	to ride a stable income for her lifestyle, given her university training as a nurse.
411900	416480	Her main focus at the time was World of Warcraft, and she seemed to have a decent base of supporters
416480	423040	that were committed. By mid-2013 she had around 26,000 followers, but around 3.5 million views.
423040	427100	She was somewhat known in the community, and was involved in some camaraderie. In this
427100	431460	clip she supposedly went on an e-date with another streamer, and you can feel the romantic
431460	433980	chemistry radiating off the screen.
433980	438180	I forgot to give you these flowers when we first got here. I forgot I'm in the limo.
438180	444200	That's where I just went right now, but... I would like you to have these flowers.
444200	445800	Because they're pretty, and...
445800	447900	I gotta, I gotta put your...
447900	449060	There, okay.
449060	451460	Oh, you got me flowers!
451460	452340	Yeah.
455340	456620	They're pretty.
456620	460820	She also posted some pictures to Twitter, which received positive reactions from her
460820	465780	audience. Generally, even in 2013, however, people had the impression that she wasn't
465780	470860	exactly known for her personality, many comments claiming that, as people went, she was rather
470860	475660	vapid. It kinda made me feel bad if I was accepting the idea that she didn't necessarily
475660	480300	see herself that way, although I kind of have a hunch she did know what she was doing, especially
480300	482620	when she puts her feet pics on the market.
482620	488020	If you guys are able to carry me to the 1900s, I'll give you feet pictures.
488020	489340	Yes!
489340	489840	Yeah.
489840	496260	We did it! We did it! Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude! No, shut up! We're in! We can do that in just two weeks!
496260	502820	However, on the 17th of August 2013, she announced that she was done streaming, and therefore, that was the end of
502820	507860	Alinity. Thank you for watching. I jest, I jest. I'm guessing this was something to do with someone
507860	512980	called Bodobo. In the situation which I admit I found rather hard to follow, it seems that Alinity
512980	517620	wasn't happy with some of the things that Bodobo was saying about what she deemed to be her private
517620	522420	life, and Bodobo, on the other hand, wasn't happy with how Alinity has been behaving with certain
522420	527940	individuals and not being honest about details of her relationships. This ultimately led to a Skype call
527940	532980	in which some strong words were exchanged. Is this what 2013 streamers did? I don't know.
532980	538660	But immediately what we can see here is some early evidence that Alinity isn't exactly afraid of
538660	542980	confrontation. In fact, she's not exactly the coolest of cucumbers.
543060	548660	And you don't have any, any control over my life to start talking shit about me. What are these
548660	554260	things I'm hiding? These horrible things I'm hiding? Tell me, tell me what they are, because I really
554260	559460	want to know what it is that I'm hiding. Tell me what it is that I'm hiding. Can I talk now?
560340	562020	Yeah, talk! What it is that I'm hiding.
564500	568740	Okay, first off, I don't- What it is that I'm hiding right now? Tell me!
568740	571380	Holy shit.
571380	575140	Now, there is clearly a lot of context missing to this call, and I don't know what happened
575140	579780	behind the scenes. Alinity's outburst may come from a genuine place, but regardless of what
579780	583540	happened, it's fair to say that many of us probably wouldn't have reacted like this just because
583540	588660	someone was chatting bare shit. Alinity definitely doesn't come across as someone who takes these
588660	593620	things in the most relaxed demeanor. Also, I thought I'd show you this cheeky clip. Keep this
593620	594580	in mind for later.
594580	600820	Okay, we know each other from a long time ago, and you know things about my past. Yes, I was married.
600820	609220	Yes, I got divorced. Yes, I came to Canada on a sponsorship, and there's things about my life that
609220	611860	I'd rather not discuss over the internet with people.
611860	616340	Obviously, however, her content was more than World of Warcraft, and when researching,
616340	620820	especially perusing Reddit comments, many people disputed her, some branding her as a
621060	624980	twerk for subs individuals who would exploit their rather impressive physique for their
624980	628980	viewers. Others, however, defended her, saying that people were just looking for reasons to
628980	633460	hate her because she was on that hustle. From what I've seen regarding Alinity, she didn't seem
633460	639060	that bad. It seems there are many people who are worse. She also spoke openly about some of her
639060	644500	mental health challenges, which is always content welcome on the platform. In a 2014 interview,
644500	649860	she said she was inspired by people like Shakira, another Colombian who uses her body to express
649860	653780	herself. It's an interesting discussion. If someone feels empowered by expressing
653780	657140	themselves in that way, then who are we to tell them what they should be doing?
657140	661780	Well, you see, the dispute isn't necessarily about what we think. In this instance,
661780	666260	a lot of the criticism has been directed towards Twitch, who are known for their pretty harsh
666260	670900	guidelines. I spoke earlier about the differences and similarities between YouTube and Twitch,
670900	675380	and one of them is definitely how the rules are enforced. I mentioned Zoe Burger, a person who
675380	679540	was arguably the most sexual out of the female streamers, well when she was ejected, she went
679540	683780	to YouTube to play her video games, and they let her remain on the platform, although they
683780	688580	did seem to eventually suppress her influence. Twitch have always imposed quite a strict
688580	693140	criteria, yet this strict criteria has regularly been alleged to have been undermined by the
693140	697620	behaviour of creators like Alinity and other female individuals that don't necessarily make
697620	701780	their body the sole attraction for viewers, but certainly have it as a strong marketing point.
701780	706260	It's walking the line on Twitch's policy for suggestive content. The greatest issue is that
706260	710820	Twitch don't want to unfairly sanction creators, so normally it'd be good to side on the benefit
710820	715060	of the doubt. However, if they don't act due to the benefit of the doubt, it might make the
715060	719300	creators harder to control if they become established in the community. In Twitch's
719300	723860	instance, their siding of the benefit of the doubt created a whole market for individuals
723860	727620	who walked that line, and they could only intervene when someone stepped a bit more
727620	731780	obviously out of line like Zoe Burger, and even then, they created drama which caught
731780	735940	the attention of the whole community, and only pushed her counterparts further into the
735940	740500	spotlights. However, it wasn't just directly from individuals like Zoe Burger who gained
740500	745460	many people's attention. No, over the years, particularly 2016, another genre that came
745460	750100	into light also caught people's attention, compilations. Compilations are when people
750100	754340	combine selective clips that might highlight a certain behaviour. Now, on the one hand,
754340	758420	compilations are very helpful for people, they can be more entertaining than watching the
758420	763060	bare-boats content, and people might want to view these for a specific purpose. However,
763060	767300	they can also be negative as they might provide people with the strengthened perception of what
767300	772180	might be representative of a creator. In this instance, it gave many people the idea that a
772180	776900	lot of these creators were very sexual in their behaviour. In these compilations was Alinity,
776900	781540	occasionally known for her suggestive actions, finding herself a part of these compilations.
781540	785220	Given that these compilations were also highlights, and therefore easier to watch,
785460	789620	these videos caught on much more quickly, and moved these creators not just towards
789620	795700	the more critical commentators, but also basic reaction commentators. But the reaction didn't stop there.
804180	808260	The thing is, with the growth of this genre, Twitch placed themselves in a predicament.
808260	812820	They knew what would happen if they tried to enact rules against these creators who themselves
812820	817220	bring a lot of traffic to their site. Although they are definitely the superior streaming site,
817220	821860	they don't want to lose the established creators to YouTube who have a framework themselves.
821860	826740	Oh, and Mixer, you know, that site that just acquired Ninja, kind of a big deal. Nonetheless,
826740	831460	normal creators and viewers don't have those vested interests, nor do they have to provide
831460	836340	the benefit of the doubt to these streamers. This led to the rise in criticism that Twitch was not
836340	840740	enforcing guidelines fairly. Also, given that these creators were all female, many people
840740	845780	complained that Twitch was enforcing a gender bias. With the feeling of preferential treatment
845780	850820	held by many creators, it began to lead to frustration, and even resentment towards the streamers.
850820	855700	These people were using their body in a way that many people perceived they could not, because they
855700	860020	would simply be banned. Therefore, given their treatment, it likely gave many people the feeling
860020	864500	that there was a license to mock these creators without feeling that they were punching down.
864500	869380	Numerous videos on these creators popped up, however, this did not lead to many consequences
869380	874180	other than the reinforcement of the notion of what many called Twitch thoughts. And then came
874180	879540	the PewDiePie video. The PewDiePie video that actually caused this controversy wasn't actually
879540	884340	one that was really solely centered around reacting to a single compilation video. No,
884340	889220	YouTube's then largest creator released a video in which he tested an eye-tracking device for various
889220	893940	user-submitted clips. For a part of the video, he was reacting to streamer fail compilations,
893940	895940	and then the fateful comments were made.
908340	912740	Now this was not the point that the clips of Alinity were shown, in fact, the clip of
912740	918420	Alinity was on briefly earlier in the video. In reacting to his video, Alinity confirms this.
924820	929700	Yes, well done Alinity, it was you. Anyhow, she decided to continue watching, and although
929700	935300	PewDiePie had not made the thought comment in direct reference to her clip, she felt it
935300	938420	general enough to apply to her, and thus warranting a response.
954500	970180	Now the term thought is an abbreviation for That Ho Over There, but however, before we have a
970180	975540	discourse regarding this, it is important to emphasise that we speak the Queen's English here.
975540	981540	We should not be using such petty slang as Ho is short for whore, which begins with a W. Therefore,
981540	986980	in my opinion, the proper abbreviation will be Twot. Now, this is a term that isn't exclusive
986980	991540	to Twitch, in fact, it seems to have yielded from hip-hop culture, although its origins aren't
991540	996340	completely certain. Either way, it crossed into the Twitch sphere due to this sect of females who
996340	1001780	became infamous for their appearance and behaviour. Is it fair? Well, I mean with mine that this isn't
1001780	1006820	a huge deal, I can understand why some people may be irked by the term. If someone is happy
1006820	1010900	doing that with their body, then who are we to put them down? I guess the distinguishing factor
1010900	1016180	between streamers like Alinity and Shakira is that it is a more direct interaction between
1016180	1021060	the actual monetary support and what the person does with their body, not to mention that Shakira
1021060	1026020	is a great singer too. I mean, of course, the definition of something like a twot is sexual
1026020	1030980	promiscuity, and I can understand that being labelled that on the basis of compilations might
1030980	1036020	be a bit of an annoyance, but PewDiePie doesn't really use the word in a malicious or harassing
1036020	1041300	way, and therefore any more action than criticism and discourse would seem disproportionate.
1041300	1044500	But let's see, does Alinity engage in criticism?
1044500	1051220	Yo! Can we copy StrikePewDiePie's latest video? Like, right now?
1051220	1056100	No, you can't copy StrikePewDiePie. Regardless of what he referred to you or your colleagues as,
1056100	1060900	his content was fair use, and even if what he said pissed you off, a copyright strike was not
1060900	1066260	the right way to respond. Why is it not then? Well, it's an act of grief, and although sometimes
1066260	1071620	an act of grief may be necessary when dealing with a malicious actor, most people would not interpret
1071620	1077540	PewDiePie as having been malicious enough to want any sort of response like that, as something like
1077540	1081540	that would be a breach of the guidelines regardless. His comment was clearly meant to be
1081540	1086660	facetious, he follows it with how they're gonna win over him, it's not the worst insult as insults go,
1086660	1092020	and clearly not meant for literal interpretation. Alinity's reaction doesn't really stand legally,
1092020	1096660	and it also doesn't stand morally. Unfortunately, even if conducted with a slightly more reserved
1096660	1101380	mannerism than the previous behaviour she was known for, the same rather vicious sentiment
1101380	1106420	remained. It felt like her attempt to fully suppress someone for using a term that she didn't
1106420	1112820	like, and people identified that. It unnecessarily aggrieved him. And okay, sometimes people react
1112820	1117540	disproportionately to certain things, doesn't mean they're bad people, they may just not be in the
1117540	1122900	right mindset. However, the strangest thing is, even though she was calmer than I had previously
1122900	1128340	found, in a way it made the whole clip feel worse. Rather than an uncontrolled outburst that a person
1128340	1133860	might regret, it felt like someone's smugly excusing an act out of a spite. You can even see
1133860	1140660	the slight grin on her face. It seemed like a dick move, and people don't like dicks, wait, you know
1140660	1144660	what I mean? And although we shouldn't judge someone's mindset by their outward demeanour alone,
1144660	1150020	that's the impression many people will have. That's how we interpret intent. To add to insult to
1150020	1154020	injury, she then goes back to talk about how much money she makes from copyright strikes.
1154020	1159060	But afterwards, she said very publicly that she earns a good living doing this kind of thing.
1159060	1166020	A company. That's called Collab. And they are sending me, they're sending me $700 last month,
1166820	1170100	from copy strike hitting people. Good money.
1170100	1173220	Good money. Stealing money.
1173220	1177220	Although she's clearly talking about a claim here, because you can't really make money off strikes,
1177220	1182500	because they take the video down. Everything considered, this pissed people off, PewDiePie's
1182500	1187940	fanbase included, and in case you weren't aware, PewDiePie has a pretty large fanbase. I'm sure
1187940	1193140	Linety was aware of that, and of course PewDiePie was too. We saw him reacting disproportionately
1193140	1198020	against a very large creator with a dedicated fanbase, it seemed that there was going to be
1198020	1203620	quite a messy affair quickly, but what happened ended up being worse for Linety than possibly
1203620	1210340	imagined. Have you heard of the phrase, kill them with kindness? Well honestly, it's overused,
1210340	1214420	a lot of the time you will not be able to kill someone with kindness, because even when used
1214420	1218500	metaphorically, you will typically sound sympathetic to the person you may be responding to,
1218500	1222740	which will typically quell any drama and end up preventing harm done to either party,
1222740	1227780	or it will make you look like you're being too nice to someone who is frankly rather unpleasant.
1227780	1232660	However, there are times when it is applicable, and there are times when you can be kind.
1232660	1237380	If you're in the right, and you're kind, and the person in the wrong reacts with hostility,
1237380	1242660	oh god does it look bad. PewDiePie, in spite of his controversies and occasional poor ways of
1242660	1248340	handling them, does understand the danger of a fired up fanbase, and how if instigated further
1248340	1252820	could be attributed back to him. If handled wrong, PewDiePie might be accountable for a
1252820	1257060	load of fans going ballistic on a female streamer's feed, which would not be a good
1257060	1261540	look. As much as people are fired up about copyright, I'm sure he didn't want another
1261540	1266180	Matt Hoth style court battle, the conflict would have ran much deeper, and wouldn't have been worth
1266180	1272180	it. So what he did was remove the clip immediately, and chose not to contest it, that gave him a clear
1272180	1277380	out of the drama. However, even with the clip removed, a copyright claim came in. Now this is
1277380	1282180	where it becomes interesting, and confusing, because Collab DRM denied making the claim,
1282180	1286500	and said that they had reviewed the video, and had deemed it fair use. However, PewDiePie looked
1286500	1292260	at the claim, and reported to Franco that it was Collab DRM, who then made a very strange statement.
1292260	1296340	I also reached out to Felix, who confirmed, yes it was claimed by Collab DRM, but also adding,
1296340	1299940	I can't confirm if it was because of her clip or not. This of course, because Collab DRM has the
1299940	1303380	policy of it's not their responsibility to tell you what portion of the video. He also sent me
1303380	1307540	the email that he received from YouTube, confirming that Collab DRM did in fact claim his
1307540	1312420	video. So it looks like it definitely did happen, but in Steve Bettinger's defense, separately,
1312420	1316660	without me confronting with this information, he emailed me to slightly change his response,
1316660	1320900	saying Collab DRM never issued a strike on the PewDiePie video you're referring to. We reviewed
1320900	1323940	the video, and determined it to be fair use. Which I will say is confusing, because it seems
1323940	1328180	that you're acknowledging that it was fair use. But now it appears definitively that the copyright
1328180	1332260	claim did happen. It doesn't really seem to add up. Then three days later, PewDiePie uploaded a
1332260	1336180	video where he states that although he wasn't sure that Alinity made the strike at first,
1336180	1341620	she then took credit for it. Now, we weren't sure if it was Alinity that actually did the
1341620	1347700	copy strike, or if it was just some random claim, because I get those all the time anyway,
1347700	1353540	but the day after, she made a follow up to this, where she sort of boasted about, yeah,
1354260	1359460	it was me guys. So, lots of confusion on the actual copyright claim front. However,
1359460	1363860	there was little confusion from Alinity, who following pressure from people released
1363860	1368980	another statement. This statement pinned the claim on the sexism within the streamer community,
1368980	1372900	and the fact that PewDiePie's comment was the sort of thing that contributes to the harassment
1372900	1378100	that many female streamers encounter on a daily basis. However, this hit an immediate roadblock.
1378100	1382900	The problem was that this did not seem to be the instigating factor of the initial copyright claim,
1382900	1387220	it didn't seem to be some emotional reaction spurred on by an instinctive response to
1387220	1391380	misogyny. Paired with the comments made about her income, it seemed like an opportunity to
1391380	1396820	use the comment as a scapegoat to make money, and no one, regardless of whether they have
1396820	1401620	feminist sympathies or not, is going to be with you on that one. Although harassment would never
1401620	1407060	be appropriate in that scenario, backlash from the situation has to fall somewhere at your feet
1407060	1412420	for attempting to act outside what many would deem acceptable, you poked a sleeping line with
1412420	1416740	a sharp stick. I think it is a relevant discussion, given how reductive many of the
1416740	1421460	compilations are, how it might give off the wrong impression, but ultimately they are the largest
1421460	1425700	contributors to it, and although PewDiePie understandably pledged to use the term more
1425700	1430820	carefully in the future, the copyright claim is such a radical response it completely distracts
1430820	1435860	from whatever discussion you might want to have regarding terminology. She also adds this rather
1435860	1440260	unconvincing complaint at the end about objectification, and although I can understand
1440260	1444900	why someone might be uncomfortable being labelled a twat, given the differences between taking dick
1444900	1450740	from many men and behaving slightly sexually, I feel that Alinity has to be aware of the market
1450740	1456020	that she appeals to, and how that might affect how people interpret her content. There's nothing
1456020	1460820	wrong with people behaving in a sexual manner if that's what they feel empowers them, that's what
1460820	1466900	people like Shakira did, and there's nothing wrong with taking issue with unnecessary sexualisation,
1466900	1471860	but you can't have them both at the same time. However, the worst part comes when she shifts
1471860	1477140	responsibility onto Collab DRM, who as representatives of the claimant, would have very little
1477140	1482740	additional reason to claim a video that they recognise themselves as fair use. Alinity herself
1482740	1484260	seems pretty ignorant.
1484260	1489940	Alinity- I don't really know much about the laws, but I do know that I get money out of that. Like,
1489940	1495780	it gives me money, so they do have to pay for it. Like, who's paying for that? I'm not really sure,
1495780	1501620	but I'm guessing it's the content creator that is using my content on it. I honestly don't know how
1501620	1508980	it works, but if I flag a channel, it gives me money. So, if anybody wants to use my content,
1508980	1513300	just ask me, you know? And please don't misrepresent me, please don't call me names
1513300	1519460	while using my content. It will get flagged by Collab, and I will get part of your, I don't know,
1519460	1521620	your revenue for it, or whatever it's called.
1521620	1526020	This is a terrible clip, but there has to be some irony in the fact that she clearly didn't
1526020	1530820	seek permission to watch PewDiePie's video, yet feels that people should ask permission to react
1530820	1535860	to compilations with her in. I find it hard to believe that she would be too stupid to not notice
1535860	1539780	that contradiction, as did PewDiePie, and many other people.
1539780	1544740	And I find this information to be completely redundant, because she said, I'm gonna claim the
1544740	1549940	video, the video got claimed, and then finally she took credit for getting the video claimed.
1549940	1553780	Then, because everyone fired back at her, suddenly the story is different,
1553780	1558660	suddenly it's Collab's fault. Again, finally, Alinity, I'm sorry for calling you a twitch
1558660	1564980	thot, I will definitely be careful with using that word in the future, but you need to stop
1564980	1570500	blaming other people. Stop blaming Collab DRM, stop paying some sort of sexism narrative,
1571220	1577380	stop blaming me, and admit that what you did was wrong. It's really not that hard.
1577380	1582580	PewDiePie apologised, and ultimately by doing that, put Alinity in a position where she would
1582580	1588660	be expected by many to apologise herself, or at least come to some resolution, but she didn't,
1588660	1593700	and this is where PewDiePie killed her with kindness, because she didn't have a clue in
1593700	1599540	how to actually respond, in fact her response was just further deflection onto her representatives,
1599540	1604820	Collab DRM plus a load of waffle. The problem is that at this point, PewDiePie had taken
1604820	1609620	responsibility for his side, so basically had nothing else to add, and therefore all the
1609620	1614500	attention was thrown onto Alinity, who clearly was not well equipped to respond or even hold
1614500	1619220	her own on these matters. The only way she could reverse the situation at that point was being able
1619220	1623620	to act like there were additional incidents that PewDiePie needed to be held accountable for,
1623620	1628180	which she definitely tried, she refused PewDiePie's apology, and then attempted to deepen her
1628180	1633780	victimhood by focusing on the semantics regarding his comments. Semantics are important, however,
1633780	1638900	PewDiePie's apology and explanation for why he said it satisfied enough people to just make
1638900	1642660	Alinity look unreasonable and unnecessarily demanding.
1642660	1648260	So for you to do all these things, right, and then for you to not accept my apology,
1648260	1656740	when I said sorry, twice, what do you want? You're just digging yourself deeper and deeper,
1656740	1661620	and I'm not even pushing at this point. And with people having this negative perception,
1661620	1667060	people decided that it was time to start digging, and digging, and digging, and whatever Alinity
1667060	1672420	was being framed as in PewDiePie's original video was nothing compared to what follows.
1672420	1677620	Showing your underwear on stream, that's our fault, right? And then clicking on full screen
1677620	1682660	right after. Bending over with your butt on camera, that's our fault, right? You're just
1682660	1688420	looking at your butt hair in this video, not doing anything else. Eating a popsicle down your throat
1688420	1693620	on camera, that's our fault, right? Because you had a sore in your mouth, that's why you did it,
1693620	1699700	right? Oh, you're just playing games with the shortest skirt ever. That's our fault for having
1699700	1704420	looking at it in any sexual way, right? Oh guys, I am just adjusting my camera right now,
1704420	1709460	I'm completely unaware of what else is going on. If you have any sort of sexual intention towards
1709460	1715140	this, that's our fault. Oh, sorry guys, I'm just pushing my bra together to show how a push-up
1715140	1720580	bra works. That's your fault for seeing anything sexual in that. How dare you.
1720580	1725140	Essentially, Alinity attempted to conduct a mud-slinging campaign against Felix,
1725140	1729620	retweeting various negative tweets about him, which gave PewDiePie the impetus to bite back
1729620	1733620	with his own claims. And remember that old clip about her not wanting to talk about her
1733620	1739780	relationships? Oh dear, oh dear. There's this one clip where she very publicly admits to committing
1739780	1745940	marriage fraud, that she moved to Colombia and married this guy, just so she could move
1745940	1752740	to Canada. You don't make any money, you work a lot. So I was like, no, hell no. So I married
1752740	1761060	a Canadian, and they came to Canada, and then I divorced them. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
1761060	1766420	Unfortunately, Alinity was outnumbered, both numerically and logically, and somehow became
1766420	1771460	the single greatest target and villain at the same time. How do you manage something like that?
1771460	1776580	Surely if you are the target, people will at least give you some sympathy. Well.
1784100	1789460	When reflecting on a situation, we are typically sympathetic to people who become targets of the
1789460	1794420	internet mob. Not because they haven't committed any wrongdoings, but because eventually you
1794420	1799620	reflect on it and wonder how much of the drama they actually instigated, and how many people
1799620	1804420	were just blindly hating them without asking any questions. However, with this situation,
1804420	1808980	there has been very little sympathy in any reflection, and this is mainly because Alinity,
1808980	1813460	despite receiving backlash from the fanbase of one of the largest creators on the platform,
1813460	1818980	managed to instigate almost every single instance. When you throw something at a person,
1818980	1823540	they might see it as giving them license to fling back, and this is exactly what happened
1823540	1828500	with Alinity. She tried to punch below the belt by talking about PewDiePie's other controversies,
1828500	1833620	and PewDiePie spoke about her other controversies with much greater impact. There are a few reasons
1833620	1838420	that this yielded much more impact. Firstly, PewDiePie has a greater fanbase, but also a
1838420	1843700	much greater social media presence all in all. Alinity, in spite of her following on Twitch,
1843700	1849060	only had around 67,000 Twitter followers at the time of the controversy, which is slightly low
1849060	1854900	compared to PewDiePie's then 16 million followers. Let's just say this led to some ratios.
1854900	1858740	It also didn't help that PewDiePie has been the centre of attention for ages, and therefore
1858740	1863220	nothing that people said was actually news to anyone, and therefore he wasn't being really
1863220	1867940	exposed other than through trivial rumours. Alinity, on the other hand, as a streamer who
1867940	1872820	hasn't been involved in a drama that size, has all this dirty laundry that many people
1872820	1876580	haven't seen go through the watch, and when people brought it into the light,
1876660	1881940	it was news, and was pretty damn bad. This led to her becoming one of the internet's least
1881940	1886340	favourite people, and when confronted regarding this, she once again flipped responsibility of
1886340	1903460	her comments to people reporting her to the authorities, and although I probably wouldn't
1903460	1907700	advise reporting her, in spite of the evidence, you know, people chat their shit to try and
1907700	1912500	embolden themselves in front of their audience, it's hard to feel sympathetic to her complaints.
1912500	1917140	Bragging about a crime in which there is a victim will never be overwhelmingly popular when people
1917140	1921540	look at it with a critical eye. PewDiePie did have a lot of responsibility in the handling of
1921540	1925700	the situation, which could have been misused greatly, however many people would agree that
1925700	1929540	he should be able to argue his case as well, particularly in response to anything that
1929540	1934260	Alinity says, and because he was constantly on the retaliation, this gave him the opportunity
1934260	1939620	to know what Alinity had said and respond with more impact. Another huge issue was that Alinity
1939620	1944820	just went from one argument to another, basically taking consecutive L's on every single perspective,
1944820	1947540	her points of view were just an incoherent mess.
1959540	1968980	She continuously argued the notion of responsibility, while taking none of her own.
1968980	1974020	PewDiePie continuously offered a ceasefire, and she rejected it, maybe because she thought if
1974020	1978660	the harassment became bad enough, it would help make a case for her victimhood, however because
1978660	1983780	she was seen as instigating every fan defending PewDiePie or attacking her, was seen to be doing
1983780	1988260	it because of her own statements, rather than because of anything PewDiePie actually said or
1988260	1993220	did. To add to this, the only real point of view that she could argue herself as aggrieved on was
1993220	1998500	the perspective of sexism, now in a way you could argue that the gender perspective could give her
1998500	2003700	a hard time, there is a lot of prejudice, but as said, many people would suspect that actually her
2003700	2008420	gender gave her an advantage, especially on Twitch, particularly given the genre that she had
2008420	2012100	rose to prominence in. And then, to top it all off, she just said this,
2033220	2037460	And this irritated a lot of people, because as mentioned earlier, everyone knows about how
2037460	2041860	Twitch treat many streamers, how harshly they enforce many of their guidelines, to have this
2041860	2047380	person breach the same terms of service and not face any consequences at all was enraging, and
2047380	2052180	undermined any argument of disenfranchisement coming from her. Throughout it all, she delivered
2052180	2057060	her words with the same very dispassionate tone, and although it's important that you don't let
2057060	2061300	your emotions interfere with your points of view too much, because her arguments seemed emotionally
2061300	2066260	based, when paired with her delivery, it just seemed very uncomfortable, and plain manipulative
2066260	2073620	for many people. I felt very upset. This has upset me a lot. She always has a trend of continuously
2073620	2078660	attacking people's previous prejudices as a way to deflect current criticism, and although people
2078660	2083380	may be harsher on her, for sure, it doesn't mean she is above the criticism. Later on in the same
2083380	2087700	stream, she used people's least favourite racial slur, the one beginning with the letter N of
2087700	2092020	course, and once again, although not the most malicious manner given Twitch's extremely harsh
2092020	2096980	enforcement of the guidelines, and the context of it being in the same stream, this irritated a lot
2096980	2101540	of people, and further elevated how untouchable she seemed to perceive herself as.
2101540	2103780	You coming not saying that ever again? Okay.
2106660	2111220	Well, I'm part black, so I don't see why the- like, why would they say that?
2112100	2116900	Well, I wouldn't say- I'm like 10% black, I don't think I- whatever.
2116900	2119940	Did she just use the Keemstar defence? Oh no.
2120020	2125620	This does not seem good. You'd find very few neutral actors who defend her behaviour at this point.
2125620	2131700	But wait, there was one more publication willing to stand up against PewDiePie. Wait, no, nevermind
2131700	2136100	it's vice. I did actually respond to this article briefly last year in a video about Mr. Beast.
2136100	2140980	To sum it up, it's really bad and arguably one of the worst cases of decontextualisation there has
2140980	2145940	been for a while. Although the concern of making sure that you do not frame any victim as asking
2145940	2150500	for it is a concern that we should all pay attention to, I do not think the slippery slope
2150500	2155060	from Felix's comments were there. And yes, for some reason, having the backing of a mainstream
2155060	2160260	outlet wasn't a huge support winner. Alinity was being attacked on nearly every platform,
2160260	2164580	and her support just wasn't following through to many corners of the internet.
2164580	2169620	However, she never backed down. Why wouldn't she? Let's ask that question.
2176820	2184420	When someone becomes involved in drama, one of the most constraining factors ultimately comes
2184420	2190180	down to your audience. I spoke about it right at the start. When UI twitched Dreamer, whose appeal
2190180	2195780	is partly your appearance, decorum is a liberty, and Alinity recognised that. Normally when you
2195780	2200180	encounter drama where you receive substantial amounts of criticism, you would lose support.
2200180	2204820	But if you head over to Alinity's social blade, you'll see that her growth was largely unaffected
2204820	2210260	by the drama. That was exactly the same with Pokimane 2. Despite being criticised by the
2210260	2215620	commentators very harshly, when it came down to the numbers, there was very little change.
2215620	2220420	Therefore, if she didn't actually feel like apologising, well, she had very little to lose
2220420	2225620	by not. She's in drama with someone who, in spite of their prominence, can't really cause any damage
2225620	2230180	to the channel or the income that she's receiving, partly due to the fact that she's on Twitch,
2230180	2234580	and partly because her appeal is separate from her credibility. No one expected her
2234580	2238980	to be the voice of reason, although many people would agree Twitch should be treating people
2238980	2244340	equally. Unfortunately, that's not how it works, and as sad as it is, the drama isn't the greatest
2244340	2249700	deal in the grand scheme of things. She had who she needed to on her side, who derived benefit
2249700	2254420	from her entertainment that isn't compromised by the drama, and therefore they want to keep
2254420	2259940	watching her. This gave her license to basically behave how she wanted to, and she did. However,
2259940	2264900	there was one thing that was separate to her fanbase, and that was the other source of support
2264900	2269620	that was indispensable for her, Twitch themselves. Many people have argued that Twitch should have
2269620	2274340	punished Alinity for her conduct, yet Twitch haven't, and it appeared that she had them in
2274340	2279860	her back pocket, and once the drama died down, most people have no reason to persist. There were
2279860	2285540	more pressing dramas that caught people's interest, and the online community isn't exactly known for
2285540	2290660	their attention span. However, there was one thing that would last, the impression that she left on
2290660	2295620	many people. Impressions aren't important if we never have to come into contact with them again,
2295620	2300340	and for a good year we didn't. There was a brief situation at the end of the year where she accused
2300340	2306420	another streamer of sexual harassment, and provided some corroborating screenshots. The other streamer
2306420	2310740	openly denied these claims, and retained a lawyer. People would have been foolish to drag her over
2310740	2315780	this because they are quite serious, and it seems that it's still an open case, but there have been
2315780	2321060	no updates since around November last year, so I guess we'll just wait on that one. However, it was
2321060	2326740	not the end of community run-ins with Alinity, and everything that had happened in the past would now
2326740	2331780	come back to bite her. In the past, many people had accused Alinity of throwing her pussy around.
2332420	2336820	However, few would have been able to call how literal this phrase would be applied, because on
2336820	2343140	the 18th of June 2019, Alinity was doing what she normally does on Twitch, streaming, and her cat
2343140	2350020	obstructed her gamer view, and like any sane normal human being, you don't let the pets get in the way.
2350020	2355460	She responded by taking the cat, and throwing it over her head fairly abruptly. This clip began to
2355460	2359620	spread throughout the internet, and like the internet, they then found more clips regarding
2359620	2365380	Alinity, and her cat, and her other pets, including this very charming one where she decides that her
2365380	2370420	cat's in the mood for a cheeky drink, a nice cocktail of vodka and saliva. It then hit reporters
2370420	2376260	like Keemstar, and then PETA, the controversial animal rights group with questionable hot takes.
2376260	2381300	However, the take this time was pretty al dente. They were not satisfied with Alinity's behaviour,
2381300	2387140	and they wanted Twitch to take action. Like Mount Vesuvius, the dormant community erupted into a
2387140	2392020	united call of criticism. This was really the perfect opportunity, because there was no way that
2392100	2397460	Alinity could put the blame on the cat, and therefore there was no defined enemy for Alinity
2397460	2402340	to victimise herself against. In light of these claims and the corroborating footage, her local
2402340	2408100	animal protection society launched an investigation into her contact with the animal, and it was not
2408100	2414260	looking good for her. So what does she do? Well, she did the unthinkable, she apologised.
2416580	2421780	In these tweets, she apologises for her quote lapses in judgement, and commits to complying
2421780	2427540	with any animal abuse investigation, while stating that her cats do live in a loving environment.
2427540	2432180	This could have been over, this could have been it, but people weren't prepared to let it go,
2432180	2436820	and it was even less likely to have been let go when Twitch decided that they weren't going to
2436820	2442100	take any action at all. On first glance, maybe a warning would suffice, but new evidence came
2442100	2446820	forward regarding Twitch's treatment of streamers. One clip regarding another streamer who went by
2446820	2452500	the name of Bebe, who was seemingly banned for 14 days following a similar incident in which she
2452500	2457940	tossed a cat over her head. She put out a statement regarding this hypocrisy where she seems to confirm
2457940	2462660	that a temporary ban was placed on her. This video comparison relating to it then spread fairly
2462660	2468500	quickly, and caused further outrage among critics. Then the videos came, they came fast, and they came
2468500	2473780	hard. Harping on Alinity for her behaviour and her privilege, and attacking Twitch for their double
2473780	2478660	standards, there was not really much defending to be done, and although some people had actually
2478660	2483860	defended her actions, few people could actually defend Twitch if they gave her another pass,
2483860	2488180	especially with all her previous actions and comments that Twitch is giving her exemptions
2488180	2493060	from any actual retribution. People are reaching the stage where they ask how much more would a
2493060	2498260	person like Alinity need to do to actually see any action taken against her. The weird thing is,
2498260	2502100	I don't think this would have been a huge controversy if she'd never been involved in
2502100	2506660	the controversies in the previous year. And in a way, if you're a stubborn person, it might feel
2506660	2511700	better to stand your ground, even if everyone hates you. If you can retain your fan base while
2511700	2516900	still being a little belligerent, then it might feel validating. However, when your future relies
2516900	2521300	on the fact that you're walking the line between what might be acceptable and what might not be,
2521300	2527780	then people will obviously see these situations as an opportunity to call on you to face repercussions,
2527780	2532820	and those calls will not go away. Nonetheless, there is also inside information that we might
2532820	2537540	not be aware of. One of Twitch's heads of media put out a tweet where they stated that they were
2537540	2541860	in favour of Alinity's suspension from the platform for a certain amount of time, but
2541860	2547300	ultimately had no authority to make that call, which was, to be frank, rather concerning. On top
2547300	2552340	of this, much like the racial slur she had made, this was no longer talking about suggestive
2552340	2558100	behaviour that made her and others popular. This was unambiguous. This is not something that they
2558100	2563860	would have set any standard for other streamers in the genre. This is a blatant exception made by
2563860	2568820	Twitch, and the fact that she's the beneficiary of this has only made her more unpopular.
2568820	2570980	How bad is it? Let's have a discussion.
2570980	2582660	When someone commits a wrongdoing, we like to see them held accountable for their actions.
2582660	2587220	It's a simple enough notion, and when we feel like they have paid their dues, then we might be open
2587220	2592420	to not hating them anymore, depending on their conduct and how they feel about it. Sometimes,
2592420	2597460	if an authority fails to take action, we might hate the authority more than the actual person.
2597460	2602340	In this instance, if this had been an isolated incident, it might be a scenario of hating the
2602340	2607060	game rather than the player. However, with the fact that Alinity had openly admitted to being
2607060	2612420	on somewhat chummy relationships with the Twitch authority, it basically made her part of the game
2612420	2618100	that many people absolutely loathe. Alinity isn't ignorant of what she's doing, she's completely
2618100	2623140	knowledgeable of the privilege that she has obtained, and in many ways highly indulgent
2623140	2627700	of it, provoking breaches of the guidelines that she must be aware of. On one stream,
2627700	2632900	she takes a picture of her buttocks, with the camera shot reflecting onto the stream.
2632900	2636980	No action was taken. In two other streams, she was reported to bring up porn on the screen,
2636980	2641700	however these were accidental, so she was let off, which is fair enough, but still something
2641700	2646180	to take note of, and when called out on this treatment, she is regularly attempted to make
2646180	2651780	herself the victim, from her position, and although the stereotypical branding of a twat I can
2651780	2657380	understand might irks on, and even put them down in a way, it feels like a small drawback in a role
2657380	2662500	that is clearly derived due to many benefits of the market, and many benefits of the doubt,
2662500	2666900	that many would agree you do not deserve. Honestly, if Twitch punished her at this point,
2666900	2671460	she might catch a bit less flak in the future, but because Twitch have failed to take action
2671460	2676740	in the past, people will now be looking for reasons to campaign for her suspension on the platform.
2676740	2681620	Now there are two reasons why this may not matter to Alinity, first one being if she completely
2681620	2686340	avoids these controversies in the future, now this is slightly doubtful given her record of
2686340	2691300	controversies, and how abrasive she seems to be, whether by impulse or calculation, she does seem
2691300	2695620	to annoy people, and on top of this, whenever something occurs, it seems to provoke another
2695620	2699700	wave of people searching for other related incidents that piles on pressure for Twitch to
2699700	2704740	take action, so I doubt this will be the last time we hear of her. The second condition is that Twitch
2704740	2710260	actually are so tight with Alinity, they will never take any action no matter what. I think
2710340	2714980	this is a more plausible condition, but it would certainly depend on the extent that Alinity pushes
2714980	2719620	the boundaries, the only rational reason that I perceive they keep people like her on the site
2719620	2724420	during these incidents is due to the possible prospect of encouraging competition. Obviously,
2724420	2728980	that excludes other theories like deep personal connections or possible blackmail, although the
2728980	2733060	evidence that there is some deeper link is quite compelling in itself, given that many streamers
2733060	2737060	have reported that they've been banned for talking about the incident alone, and there are many
2737060	2741540	rumours and claims that there does seem to be some coherence to. The question is, when a competitor
2741540	2746100	comes along, and people can judge a platform on the basis of morality rather than practicality,
2746100	2751140	who will Twitch back? I do wonder how much longer it'd take for Twitch to feel like they've been
2751140	2755860	losing more than they're gaining from keeping Alinity on the platform without any punishment.
2755860	2761140	Honestly, when you do nothing, it's hard to get people to boycott your platform, but this
2761140	2766100	animal maltreatment thing seems to be the closest she's ever been to actually being impacted by
2766100	2770740	controversy, and even then she's remained in the green because people don't feel bad supporting
2770740	2775460	someone whose appeal isn't inextricably linked to how they treat animals, and unfortunately,
2775460	2780340	the fact that her audience nor Twitch is prepared to react, she'll probably continue to behave
2780340	2785780	recklessly. Now, to be fair, if the authorities who are investigating this animal maltreatment case
2785780	2792020	give her a bit of a scare, wait no, never mind, if the authority finds this, then I can't act as if
2792020	2798020	I have a greater insight to the home life of a cat, but I don't really understand how they can
2798020	2805140	say this didn't have quote malicious intent, while throwing a cat over the head, or spitting vodka,
2805140	2811620	like okay, she didn't intend to cause any harm, but it's still reckless and stupid, and a bad thing
2811620	2816900	to do on screen. I don't think that was the point that people were trying to make, and you know
2816900	2821300	what? I don't want to see her lose her pets over these incidents, I think that would be a
2821300	2826740	disproportionate reaction, but as reports go, you really downplay the instance, I mean you don't
2826740	2832340	even say what they were, I'm not gonna give her stick if Alinity pledges to treat her pets better,
2832340	2837380	and I do believe she has the capacity to, even if it's just for the sake of protecting her career,
2837380	2841300	but it's important that people are actually informed of what a person has done, so they
2841300	2845540	can judge it from an informed perspective, but regardless of how she treats her pets,
2845540	2850260	when it comes to treating commentators and other creators who may give her criticism,
2850260	2855700	particularly audiences, Alinity sees no consequence from being defensive, abrasive,
2855700	2860100	and confrontational, so chances are when these situations transpire in the future, she will
2860100	2865540	continue to be that way, she has no motivation to change, and until she does that, she will be that
2865540	2871700	way, and I mean ultimately being rather unpleasant doesn't preface you not being right, you could be
2871700	2876820	unpleasant, and completely right, it's just Alinity wasn't, in my opinion she has been
2876820	2882100	completely wrong, and her doubling down on it has only been done out of personal pride, where there
2882100	2886420	are any behavioural causes that play into it, whether her mental health may be involved is
2886420	2891700	another question, but regardless, her actions and responses to criticism give off the impression
2891700	2896660	that she does not understand the responsibility that she has misused as a public figure, and thus
2896660	2900980	does attract rightful criticism from the basis that she might hurt someone else again due to
2900980	2906020	that lack of understanding. As for Twitch, I think they should have taken action against her,
2906020	2910340	given all the liberties they permit, however this seems to be a constant problem with all
2910340	2914980	larger platforms, that anyone with significant clout receives special treatment, while people
2914980	2919780	at the bottom are constantly being weeded out by the moderators, everyone's been the victim of that
2919780	2924180	unfortunately, although I really do question what they would have lost by temporarily banning
2924180	2929460	Alinity this time round, it's not really related to the market or a standard that you might set,
2929460	2934500	having a rule for not throwing cats seems fair enough, and I really doubt many people would have
2934500	2939860	sided with animal cruelty, and I really doubt that Alinity would have been able to rile up a narrative
2939860	2945860	of injustice, or move a majority of the market over to a competing platform, YouTube isn't quite
2945860	2950820	equipped enough to win over a lot of the Twitch streamers, and Alinity doesn't seem like a person
2950820	2956260	with a huge influence over other Twitch names, it does really make me wonder why if there's
2956260	2961140	something a bit more personal going on, it would not surprise me, either way Twitch's continuous
2961140	2965860	protection of Alinity with no repercussion at all will continue to rub people the wrong way,
2965860	2970020	and the fact that Alinity is very aware of it will make her much more contemptible for people
2970020	2975060	who observe these situations. As for the viewers, there will be many people who unconditionally
2975060	2980420	support her, I have a hunch that there are also many people who acknowledge her character slightly
2980420	2985140	flawed, but enjoy her content nonetheless, and that will continue unless she does something
2985140	2991460	really really bad, but I don't think she would go that far. And what about me, her critic?
2991460	2997140	All these critics? Well, once upon a time, the hatred she may have received may have been due to
2997140	3003060	the sneering elitism towards the type of audience she appealed to, however, five years on, and she
3003060	3008020	has given people many additional reasons to dislike her. At this point, there can be little doubt that
3008020	3012500	Alinity's position of privilege, pride, and pernition has made her one of the most unpopular
3012500	3017380	persons on the platform, but as long as she's on that platform, people are powerless, and damn
3017380	3022980	right she knows it. But there's one thing guaranteed, they will be waiting. So that was
3022980	3029780	the video, I hope you really enjoyed it, I had fun, a lot of fun, this was a long one, but sometimes
3029780	3036260	they need to be long to revisit all these ideas. I'd love to give a big shout out to the editors,
3036260	3042180	once again, I'm sure they did a great job, I could never understate that. I'm really looking
3042180	3046260	forward to seeing the finished product, and go and check them out and send them some love on that
3046260	3052340	behalf. I need to give a big shout out to my Patreons, the $10 Patreons plus are on screen
3052340	3058180	right now, but I do have some special, special people that I need to give a special, special
3058180	3066740	shout out to. These Patreons include my $50 Patreons, Caroline, Nico Deschamps, Rocket Ralph,
3066740	3074820	Sarah Elizabeth, Sumhala Baloo, and the Specter Angel. Three, $300 Patreons, Brandon Junck,
3074820	3081060	Adam Michael, and Christopher Karrasz. It's a very nice name, Christopher Karrasz. I think Christopher
3081060	3086260	Karrasz is the newest Patreon, so welcome to the crew, we've got a nice little entourage pulling up
3086260	3091700	right now that I'm very proud of, and I appreciate all the support you guys give. If you want to
3091700	3098580	reach me, you can contact me on Twitter, at The Right Opinion, Facebook too, I've also got a Discord,
3098580	3103060	all the links to those will be in the pinned comments if you want to follow them there.
3103060	3107940	Otherwise, I don't think I have too much else to add, I hope you guys are doing well as always,
3107940	3114340	and I do hope you have a lovely, lovely day. Take care my friends, I'm The Right Opinion,
