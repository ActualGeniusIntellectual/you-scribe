00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,800
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,620
too much free time, and Twitch streamers, a unique brand of crater.

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,720
We've spoken about them a few times on this channel, but there's always new corners

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,540
to explore, and as always, that's what we'll be doing today, we'll be invading Twitch

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,200
from the sidelines of YouTube, because Twitch and YouTube, although having a lot of crater

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,480
overlap, also have very different dynamics, which is why there are people who use both

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,480
platforms.

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,840
In a way, it seems there is a mutual understanding.

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,640
Twitch understand that they probably can't compete with YouTube's upload features,

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,680
and YouTube, although attempting to have their own stream assets, know that Twitch's specialised

11
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,440
setup is a bit more of a step up from their own.

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,880
Twitch and YouTube, however, due to that overlap, will have somewhat similar audiences, and

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,000
that means that you can typically expect that you will find some underlying commonalities

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,480
in the popular content craters, one of those markets being attractive females.

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,080
Now being an attractive female does not predispose you to success, but in the glorious society

16
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,400
that we live in, many younger individuals, and slightly older individuals, feel excitement

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,580
from viewing people who may be attractive.

18
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,080
Probably the YouTube embodiment of this crater is SS SnipeWolf, you know, that person who

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,280
won a gaming award even though she barely games, and she switched her reaction commentary

20
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,720
ages ago, you know, she flossed, and although I can't say for sure, my judgement deemed

21
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,360
it lacking the sufficient irony to be classed as remotely humorous.

22
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,600
She's also doing very little gusto, I want more effort next time, SS SnipeWolf.

23
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,240
Now I don't doubt that she has a great business mind, I mean, you kinda have to when you've

24
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,960
been a criminal, but as a curator, her work does sometimes leave a lot to be desired.

25
00:01:40,960 --> 00:02:01,680
This is what I class as the sort of attractive female content, and I'm not saying that obviously

26
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,660
this is the sole prerequisite, there's a reason I haven't started doing facecam content yet,

27
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,600
and it's clear that it's good clickbait that might grab external audiences, but in the

28
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,800
core fanbase, well yeah, you can note some trends, the various moods after winning the

29
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,240
award, congrats Leah, you deserve the award from our wolf pack support, you look gorgeous,

30
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:27,360
the ceremony, by the way, hearty eyes, hearty eyes, fire, fire, and then 4 pictures, but

31
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,520
I guess she looks gorgeous in all of them.

32
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,200
So yes, SS SnipeWolf may be the best example of the exploitation of that sort of appeal,

33
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,840
however very few people necessarily see her reflective of YouTube's cultural landscape,

34
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,840
in spite of the significant views she pulls, and the number of times she ends up on YouTube's

35
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,720
trending. If I was to say, women of YouTube, people would probably come up with a variety

36
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,560
of answers, Lele Pons, Jenna Marbles, Lilly Singh, etc, etc, etc.

37
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,780
If you asked any standard creator about the women of Twitch, however, well you'd probably

38
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,660
hear an answer that encapsulates one of the more notorious genres. The word that some

39
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,520
people like to use is thot, but here on the right opinion, we are respectful of women,

40
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,760
and being a ladies man has given me ample training for that. It's strange because there

41
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,960
are a variety of female Twitch streamers, but ultimately the perception has been tainted

42
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,520
by the existence of many things, including the commentator.

43
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:23,440
Oh Twitch girls, the crème de la crème of online content.

44
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,000
One thing that transcends platforms is the existence of irritating commentators, who

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,080
have opinions on everything, damn people with opinions, who would dare have those? Now I

46
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,040
don't mean the commentators are on Twitch necessarily, I mean heaven forbid what would

47
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,360
happen if that was the case, but in the last couple years, because of the market, people

48
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,240
have gone after the brand of Twitch streamer that is at the centre of attention today,

49
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,600
and has definitely put them at the forefront of Twitch's image for better and for worse.

50
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,420
Why though? Well a lot of streamers like that have always existed on the platform, but the

51
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:58,080
image really became synonymous with the rise of people like Zoe Burger, who not just became

52
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,580
infamous for that behaviour, but also crossed the line over to the YouTube sphere thus garnering

53
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,900
the attention of many commentators at that time. Although Zoe Burger's fame was short

54
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,300
lived, the attention persisted, and eventually many female streamers became pretty popular

55
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:16,020
amongst commentary circles on YouTube as well. Ultimately this created a cycle, and the commentary

56
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,100
that we witness today is a byproduct of that.

57
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,900
However, people being popular is an interesting concept on its own, because as a popular creator,

58
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,940
there is always a level of accountability to one's audience that a creator should feel.

59
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,620
Nonetheless, the level of inherent accountability is often based off the appeal of the creator.

60
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,560
I've spoken about this before, so I won't linger on it too much.

61
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,740
Commentators and streamers have clashed on a few occasions, probably the most notable

62
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,580
one earlier this year was when Pokimane was called out by PewDiePie, and some other creators

63
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,300
for some rather poor behaviour. She did actually respond to it, and was quite involved in drama

64
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,580
following the situation, however one thing that she did attempt to do was engage with

65
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,620
the other side, and not be combative. However, being pleasant is more of a liberty when your

66
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,420
appeal is based off something not related to your direct demeanour, and that brings

67
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,740
us to Alinity.

68
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,120
Alinity, also known as Alinity Divine, is a 31 year old creator residing in Canada,

69
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,660
although she was initially born and raised in Colombia. She began streaming in 2012,

70
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:20,300
and over the years has built a follower base of over 930,000. Not something to be jeered

71
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:26,540
against. Her content consists of gaming streams and videos, discussion and some physical activities.

72
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,700
This obviously makes some of the viewers very satisfied on browsing her recent clips, I

73
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,620
picked one named Six, which was a rather innocent video involving her dog, however the thumbnail

74
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:41,500
had been picked fairly carefully, and it was not a wonder that this was her second most

75
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,060
viewed clip of recent.

76
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,940
For a long time, Alinity was just another female streamer doing her thing, but in the

77
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,100
last couple of years something changed, a run of incidents that left her at odds with

78
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,860
many people, particularly the commentator, escalating most recently with many people

79
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:01,660
calling for her removal from the platform due to the treatment of her cat. However,

80
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,460
if this was the only incident, would people really be calling for her termination? Well,

81
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:11,680
I think we should find out. Today I want to discuss exactly how Alinity came to fame,

82
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,360
how she came to notoriety, and exactly what led people up to the point where many think

83
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,880
that she has to be stopped. It's a long story, but I assume you're ready, because

84
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,840
you've got this far. Let's go.

85
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,680
Alinity has been streaming for almost seven years. Now, it is difficult to find any comprehensive

86
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,840
history, however we can look at the growth of her channel, and one thing that struck

87
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,320
me was that, providing the information I found was accurate, her growth came pretty instantaneously.

88
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,320
She streamed every day for four to eight hours, with the main goal to raise the monies

89
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,900
to ride a stable income for her lifestyle, given her university training as a nurse.

90
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,480
Her main focus at the time was World of Warcraft, and she seemed to have a decent base of supporters

91
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:03,040
that were committed. By mid-2013 she had around 26,000 followers, but around 3.5 million views.

92
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,100
She was somewhat known in the community, and was involved in some camaraderie. In this

93
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,460
clip she supposedly went on an e-date with another streamer, and you can feel the romantic

94
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,980
chemistry radiating off the screen.

95
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,180
I forgot to give you these flowers when we first got here. I forgot I'm in the limo.

96
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:24,200
That's where I just went right now, but... I would like you to have these flowers.

97
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,800
Because they're pretty, and...

98
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,900
I gotta, I gotta put your...

99
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,060
There, okay.

100
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,460
Oh, you got me flowers!

101
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,340
Yeah.

102
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,620
They're pretty.

103
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,820
She also posted some pictures to Twitter, which received positive reactions from her

104
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:45,780
audience. Generally, even in 2013, however, people had the impression that she wasn't

105
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,860
exactly known for her personality, many comments claiming that, as people went, she was rather

106
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,660
vapid. It kinda made me feel bad if I was accepting the idea that she didn't necessarily

107
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:00,300
see herself that way, although I kind of have a hunch she did know what she was doing, especially

108
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,620
when she puts her feet pics on the market.

109
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:08,020
If you guys are able to carry me to the 1900s, I'll give you feet pictures.

110
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,340
Yes!

111
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:09,840
Yeah.

112
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:16,260
We did it! We did it! Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude! No, shut up! We're in! We can do that in just two weeks!

113
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:22,820
However, on the 17th of August 2013, she announced that she was done streaming, and therefore, that was the end of

114
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,860
Alinity. Thank you for watching. I jest, I jest. I'm guessing this was something to do with someone

115
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,980
called Bodobo. In the situation which I admit I found rather hard to follow, it seems that Alinity

116
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:37,620
wasn't happy with some of the things that Bodobo was saying about what she deemed to be her private

117
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,420
life, and Bodobo, on the other hand, wasn't happy with how Alinity has been behaving with certain

118
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:47,940
individuals and not being honest about details of her relationships. This ultimately led to a Skype call

119
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,980
in which some strong words were exchanged. Is this what 2013 streamers did? I don't know.

120
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:58,660
But immediately what we can see here is some early evidence that Alinity isn't exactly afraid of

121
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,980
confrontation. In fact, she's not exactly the coolest of cucumbers.

122
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:08,660
And you don't have any, any control over my life to start talking shit about me. What are these

123
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:14,260
things I'm hiding? These horrible things I'm hiding? Tell me, tell me what they are, because I really

124
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:19,460
want to know what it is that I'm hiding. Tell me what it is that I'm hiding. Can I talk now?

125
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,020
Yeah, talk! What it is that I'm hiding.

126
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,740
Okay, first off, I don't- What it is that I'm hiding right now? Tell me!

127
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,380
Holy shit.

128
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,140
Now, there is clearly a lot of context missing to this call, and I don't know what happened

129
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,780
behind the scenes. Alinity's outburst may come from a genuine place, but regardless of what

130
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,540
happened, it's fair to say that many of us probably wouldn't have reacted like this just because

131
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,660
someone was chatting bare shit. Alinity definitely doesn't come across as someone who takes these

132
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,620
things in the most relaxed demeanor. Also, I thought I'd show you this cheeky clip. Keep this

133
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,580
in mind for later.

134
00:09:54,580 --> 00:10:00,820
Okay, we know each other from a long time ago, and you know things about my past. Yes, I was married.

135
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:09,220
Yes, I got divorced. Yes, I came to Canada on a sponsorship, and there's things about my life that

136
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,860
I'd rather not discuss over the internet with people.

137
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:16,340
Obviously, however, her content was more than World of Warcraft, and when researching,

138
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:20,820
especially perusing Reddit comments, many people disputed her, some branding her as a

139
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,980
twerk for subs individuals who would exploit their rather impressive physique for their

140
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,980
viewers. Others, however, defended her, saying that people were just looking for reasons to

141
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,460
hate her because she was on that hustle. From what I've seen regarding Alinity, she didn't seem

142
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:39,060
that bad. It seems there are many people who are worse. She also spoke openly about some of her

143
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:44,500
mental health challenges, which is always content welcome on the platform. In a 2014 interview,

144
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,860
she said she was inspired by people like Shakira, another Colombian who uses her body to express

145
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,780
herself. It's an interesting discussion. If someone feels empowered by expressing

146
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,140
themselves in that way, then who are we to tell them what they should be doing?

147
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:01,780
Well, you see, the dispute isn't necessarily about what we think. In this instance,

148
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:06,260
a lot of the criticism has been directed towards Twitch, who are known for their pretty harsh

149
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,900
guidelines. I spoke earlier about the differences and similarities between YouTube and Twitch,

150
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:15,380
and one of them is definitely how the rules are enforced. I mentioned Zoe Burger, a person who

151
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:19,540
was arguably the most sexual out of the female streamers, well when she was ejected, she went

152
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,780
to YouTube to play her video games, and they let her remain on the platform, although they

153
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:28,580
did seem to eventually suppress her influence. Twitch have always imposed quite a strict

154
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:33,140
criteria, yet this strict criteria has regularly been alleged to have been undermined by the

155
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:37,620
behaviour of creators like Alinity and other female individuals that don't necessarily make

156
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,780
their body the sole attraction for viewers, but certainly have it as a strong marketing point.

157
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:46,260
It's walking the line on Twitch's policy for suggestive content. The greatest issue is that

158
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,820
Twitch don't want to unfairly sanction creators, so normally it'd be good to side on the benefit

159
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,060
of the doubt. However, if they don't act due to the benefit of the doubt, it might make the

160
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,300
creators harder to control if they become established in the community. In Twitch's

161
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,860
instance, their siding of the benefit of the doubt created a whole market for individuals

162
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,620
who walked that line, and they could only intervene when someone stepped a bit more

163
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,780
obviously out of line like Zoe Burger, and even then, they created drama which caught

164
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,940
the attention of the whole community, and only pushed her counterparts further into the

165
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:20,500
spotlights. However, it wasn't just directly from individuals like Zoe Burger who gained

166
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,460
many people's attention. No, over the years, particularly 2016, another genre that came

167
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:30,100
into light also caught people's attention, compilations. Compilations are when people

168
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,340
combine selective clips that might highlight a certain behaviour. Now, on the one hand,

169
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:38,420
compilations are very helpful for people, they can be more entertaining than watching the

170
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:43,060
bare-boats content, and people might want to view these for a specific purpose. However,

171
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:47,300
they can also be negative as they might provide people with the strengthened perception of what

172
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:52,180
might be representative of a creator. In this instance, it gave many people the idea that a

173
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,900
lot of these creators were very sexual in their behaviour. In these compilations was Alinity,

174
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,540
occasionally known for her suggestive actions, finding herself a part of these compilations.

175
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,220
Given that these compilations were also highlights, and therefore easier to watch,

176
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,620
these videos caught on much more quickly, and moved these creators not just towards

177
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:15,700
the more critical commentators, but also basic reaction commentators. But the reaction didn't stop there.

178
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,260
The thing is, with the growth of this genre, Twitch placed themselves in a predicament.

179
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,820
They knew what would happen if they tried to enact rules against these creators who themselves

180
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,220
bring a lot of traffic to their site. Although they are definitely the superior streaming site,

181
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:41,860
they don't want to lose the established creators to YouTube who have a framework themselves.

182
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,740
Oh, and Mixer, you know, that site that just acquired Ninja, kind of a big deal. Nonetheless,

183
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,460
normal creators and viewers don't have those vested interests, nor do they have to provide

184
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:56,340
the benefit of the doubt to these streamers. This led to the rise in criticism that Twitch was not

185
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,740
enforcing guidelines fairly. Also, given that these creators were all female, many people

186
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,780
complained that Twitch was enforcing a gender bias. With the feeling of preferential treatment

187
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:10,820
held by many creators, it began to lead to frustration, and even resentment towards the streamers.

188
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:15,700
These people were using their body in a way that many people perceived they could not, because they

189
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,020
would simply be banned. Therefore, given their treatment, it likely gave many people the feeling

190
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:24,500
that there was a license to mock these creators without feeling that they were punching down.

191
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,380
Numerous videos on these creators popped up, however, this did not lead to many consequences

192
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:34,180
other than the reinforcement of the notion of what many called Twitch thoughts. And then came

193
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:39,540
the PewDiePie video. The PewDiePie video that actually caused this controversy wasn't actually

194
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:44,340
one that was really solely centered around reacting to a single compilation video. No,

195
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:49,220
YouTube's then largest creator released a video in which he tested an eye-tracking device for various

196
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,940
user-submitted clips. For a part of the video, he was reacting to streamer fail compilations,

197
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,940
and then the fateful comments were made.

198
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,740
Now this was not the point that the clips of Alinity were shown, in fact, the clip of

199
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:18,420
Alinity was on briefly earlier in the video. In reacting to his video, Alinity confirms this.

200
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,700
Yes, well done Alinity, it was you. Anyhow, she decided to continue watching, and although

201
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:35,300
PewDiePie had not made the thought comment in direct reference to her clip, she felt it

202
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,420
general enough to apply to her, and thus warranting a response.

203
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:10,180
Now the term thought is an abbreviation for That Ho Over There, but however, before we have a

204
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:15,540
discourse regarding this, it is important to emphasise that we speak the Queen's English here.

205
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:21,540
We should not be using such petty slang as Ho is short for whore, which begins with a W. Therefore,

206
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:26,980
in my opinion, the proper abbreviation will be Twot. Now, this is a term that isn't exclusive

207
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:31,540
to Twitch, in fact, it seems to have yielded from hip-hop culture, although its origins aren't

208
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:36,340
completely certain. Either way, it crossed into the Twitch sphere due to this sect of females who

209
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:41,780
became infamous for their appearance and behaviour. Is it fair? Well, I mean with mine that this isn't

210
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:46,820
a huge deal, I can understand why some people may be irked by the term. If someone is happy

211
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,900
doing that with their body, then who are we to put them down? I guess the distinguishing factor

212
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:56,180
between streamers like Alinity and Shakira is that it is a more direct interaction between

213
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:01,060
the actual monetary support and what the person does with their body, not to mention that Shakira

214
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:06,020
is a great singer too. I mean, of course, the definition of something like a twot is sexual

215
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:10,980
promiscuity, and I can understand that being labelled that on the basis of compilations might

216
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:16,020
be a bit of an annoyance, but PewDiePie doesn't really use the word in a malicious or harassing

217
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:21,300
way, and therefore any more action than criticism and discourse would seem disproportionate.

218
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,500
But let's see, does Alinity engage in criticism?

219
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:31,220
Yo! Can we copy StrikePewDiePie's latest video? Like, right now?

220
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:36,100
No, you can't copy StrikePewDiePie. Regardless of what he referred to you or your colleagues as,

221
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,900
his content was fair use, and even if what he said pissed you off, a copyright strike was not

222
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:46,260
the right way to respond. Why is it not then? Well, it's an act of grief, and although sometimes

223
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:51,620
an act of grief may be necessary when dealing with a malicious actor, most people would not interpret

224
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:57,540
PewDiePie as having been malicious enough to want any sort of response like that, as something like

225
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:01,540
that would be a breach of the guidelines regardless. His comment was clearly meant to be

226
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:06,660
facetious, he follows it with how they're gonna win over him, it's not the worst insult as insults go,

227
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:12,020
and clearly not meant for literal interpretation. Alinity's reaction doesn't really stand legally,

228
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:16,660
and it also doesn't stand morally. Unfortunately, even if conducted with a slightly more reserved

229
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:21,380
mannerism than the previous behaviour she was known for, the same rather vicious sentiment

230
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:26,420
remained. It felt like her attempt to fully suppress someone for using a term that she didn't

231
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:32,820
like, and people identified that. It unnecessarily aggrieved him. And okay, sometimes people react

232
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,540
disproportionately to certain things, doesn't mean they're bad people, they may just not be in the

233
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:42,900
right mindset. However, the strangest thing is, even though she was calmer than I had previously

234
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:48,340
found, in a way it made the whole clip feel worse. Rather than an uncontrolled outburst that a person

235
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:53,860
might regret, it felt like someone's smugly excusing an act out of a spite. You can even see

236
00:18:53,860 --> 00:19:00,660
the slight grin on her face. It seemed like a dick move, and people don't like dicks, wait, you know

237
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,660
what I mean? And although we shouldn't judge someone's mindset by their outward demeanour alone,

238
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:10,020
that's the impression many people will have. That's how we interpret intent. To add to insult to

239
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,020
injury, she then goes back to talk about how much money she makes from copyright strikes.

240
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:19,060
But afterwards, she said very publicly that she earns a good living doing this kind of thing.

241
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:26,020
A company. That's called Collab. And they are sending me, they're sending me $700 last month,

242
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,100
from copy strike hitting people. Good money.

243
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,220
Good money. Stealing money.

244
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:37,220
Although she's clearly talking about a claim here, because you can't really make money off strikes,

245
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:42,500
because they take the video down. Everything considered, this pissed people off, PewDiePie's

246
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,940
fanbase included, and in case you weren't aware, PewDiePie has a pretty large fanbase. I'm sure

247
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:53,140
Linety was aware of that, and of course PewDiePie was too. We saw him reacting disproportionately

248
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:58,020
against a very large creator with a dedicated fanbase, it seemed that there was going to be

249
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:03,620
quite a messy affair quickly, but what happened ended up being worse for Linety than possibly

250
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:10,340
imagined. Have you heard of the phrase, kill them with kindness? Well honestly, it's overused,

251
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:14,420
a lot of the time you will not be able to kill someone with kindness, because even when used

252
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,500
metaphorically, you will typically sound sympathetic to the person you may be responding to,

253
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,740
which will typically quell any drama and end up preventing harm done to either party,

254
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:27,780
or it will make you look like you're being too nice to someone who is frankly rather unpleasant.

255
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:32,660
However, there are times when it is applicable, and there are times when you can be kind.

256
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:37,380
If you're in the right, and you're kind, and the person in the wrong reacts with hostility,

257
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:42,660
oh god does it look bad. PewDiePie, in spite of his controversies and occasional poor ways of

258
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:48,340
handling them, does understand the danger of a fired up fanbase, and how if instigated further

259
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,820
could be attributed back to him. If handled wrong, PewDiePie might be accountable for a

260
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:57,060
load of fans going ballistic on a female streamer's feed, which would not be a good

261
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:01,540
look. As much as people are fired up about copyright, I'm sure he didn't want another

262
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:06,180
Matt Hoth style court battle, the conflict would have ran much deeper, and wouldn't have been worth

263
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:12,180
it. So what he did was remove the clip immediately, and chose not to contest it, that gave him a clear

264
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:17,380
out of the drama. However, even with the clip removed, a copyright claim came in. Now this is

265
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:22,180
where it becomes interesting, and confusing, because Collab DRM denied making the claim,

266
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:26,500
and said that they had reviewed the video, and had deemed it fair use. However, PewDiePie looked

267
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:32,260
at the claim, and reported to Franco that it was Collab DRM, who then made a very strange statement.

268
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:36,340
I also reached out to Felix, who confirmed, yes it was claimed by Collab DRM, but also adding,

269
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,940
I can't confirm if it was because of her clip or not. This of course, because Collab DRM has the

270
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,380
policy of it's not their responsibility to tell you what portion of the video. He also sent me

271
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,540
the email that he received from YouTube, confirming that Collab DRM did in fact claim his

272
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:52,420
video. So it looks like it definitely did happen, but in Steve Bettinger's defense, separately,

273
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,660
without me confronting with this information, he emailed me to slightly change his response,

274
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,900
saying Collab DRM never issued a strike on the PewDiePie video you're referring to. We reviewed

275
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,940
the video, and determined it to be fair use. Which I will say is confusing, because it seems

276
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,180
that you're acknowledging that it was fair use. But now it appears definitively that the copyright

277
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:12,260
claim did happen. It doesn't really seem to add up. Then three days later, PewDiePie uploaded a

278
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:16,180
video where he states that although he wasn't sure that Alinity made the strike at first,

279
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:21,620
she then took credit for it. Now, we weren't sure if it was Alinity that actually did the

280
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:27,700
copy strike, or if it was just some random claim, because I get those all the time anyway,

281
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:33,540
but the day after, she made a follow up to this, where she sort of boasted about, yeah,

282
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:39,460
it was me guys. So, lots of confusion on the actual copyright claim front. However,

283
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,860
there was little confusion from Alinity, who following pressure from people released

284
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:48,980
another statement. This statement pinned the claim on the sexism within the streamer community,

285
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:52,900
and the fact that PewDiePie's comment was the sort of thing that contributes to the harassment

286
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:58,100
that many female streamers encounter on a daily basis. However, this hit an immediate roadblock.

287
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:02,900
The problem was that this did not seem to be the instigating factor of the initial copyright claim,

288
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:07,220
it didn't seem to be some emotional reaction spurred on by an instinctive response to

289
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,380
misogyny. Paired with the comments made about her income, it seemed like an opportunity to

290
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:16,820
use the comment as a scapegoat to make money, and no one, regardless of whether they have

291
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:21,620
feminist sympathies or not, is going to be with you on that one. Although harassment would never

292
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:27,060
be appropriate in that scenario, backlash from the situation has to fall somewhere at your feet

293
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:32,420
for attempting to act outside what many would deem acceptable, you poked a sleeping line with

294
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:36,740
a sharp stick. I think it is a relevant discussion, given how reductive many of the

295
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,460
compilations are, how it might give off the wrong impression, but ultimately they are the largest

296
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,700
contributors to it, and although PewDiePie understandably pledged to use the term more

297
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:50,820
carefully in the future, the copyright claim is such a radical response it completely distracts

298
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:55,860
from whatever discussion you might want to have regarding terminology. She also adds this rather

299
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:00,260
unconvincing complaint at the end about objectification, and although I can understand

300
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:04,900
why someone might be uncomfortable being labelled a twat, given the differences between taking dick

301
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:10,740
from many men and behaving slightly sexually, I feel that Alinity has to be aware of the market

302
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:16,020
that she appeals to, and how that might affect how people interpret her content. There's nothing

303
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:20,820
wrong with people behaving in a sexual manner if that's what they feel empowers them, that's what

304
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:26,900
people like Shakira did, and there's nothing wrong with taking issue with unnecessary sexualisation,

305
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,860
but you can't have them both at the same time. However, the worst part comes when she shifts

306
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:37,140
responsibility onto Collab DRM, who as representatives of the claimant, would have very little

307
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:42,740
additional reason to claim a video that they recognise themselves as fair use. Alinity herself

308
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,260
seems pretty ignorant.

309
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:49,940
Alinity- I don't really know much about the laws, but I do know that I get money out of that. Like,

310
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:55,780
it gives me money, so they do have to pay for it. Like, who's paying for that? I'm not really sure,

311
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:01,620
but I'm guessing it's the content creator that is using my content on it. I honestly don't know how

312
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:08,980
it works, but if I flag a channel, it gives me money. So, if anybody wants to use my content,

313
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,300
just ask me, you know? And please don't misrepresent me, please don't call me names

314
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:19,460
while using my content. It will get flagged by Collab, and I will get part of your, I don't know,

315
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,620
your revenue for it, or whatever it's called.

316
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:26,020
This is a terrible clip, but there has to be some irony in the fact that she clearly didn't

317
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:30,820
seek permission to watch PewDiePie's video, yet feels that people should ask permission to react

318
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:35,860
to compilations with her in. I find it hard to believe that she would be too stupid to not notice

319
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:39,780
that contradiction, as did PewDiePie, and many other people.

320
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:44,740
And I find this information to be completely redundant, because she said, I'm gonna claim the

321
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:49,940
video, the video got claimed, and then finally she took credit for getting the video claimed.

322
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,780
Then, because everyone fired back at her, suddenly the story is different,

323
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:58,660
suddenly it's Collab's fault. Again, finally, Alinity, I'm sorry for calling you a twitch

324
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:04,980
thot, I will definitely be careful with using that word in the future, but you need to stop

325
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:10,500
blaming other people. Stop blaming Collab DRM, stop paying some sort of sexism narrative,

326
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:17,380
stop blaming me, and admit that what you did was wrong. It's really not that hard.

327
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:22,580
PewDiePie apologised, and ultimately by doing that, put Alinity in a position where she would

328
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:28,660
be expected by many to apologise herself, or at least come to some resolution, but she didn't,

329
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:33,700
and this is where PewDiePie killed her with kindness, because she didn't have a clue in

330
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:39,540
how to actually respond, in fact her response was just further deflection onto her representatives,

331
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:44,820
Collab DRM plus a load of waffle. The problem is that at this point, PewDiePie had taken

332
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,620
responsibility for his side, so basically had nothing else to add, and therefore all the

333
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:54,500
attention was thrown onto Alinity, who clearly was not well equipped to respond or even hold

334
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:59,220
her own on these matters. The only way she could reverse the situation at that point was being able

335
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,620
to act like there were additional incidents that PewDiePie needed to be held accountable for,

336
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:08,180
which she definitely tried, she refused PewDiePie's apology, and then attempted to deepen her

337
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:13,780
victimhood by focusing on the semantics regarding his comments. Semantics are important, however,

338
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:18,900
PewDiePie's apology and explanation for why he said it satisfied enough people to just make

339
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,660
Alinity look unreasonable and unnecessarily demanding.

340
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:28,260
So for you to do all these things, right, and then for you to not accept my apology,

341
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:36,740
when I said sorry, twice, what do you want? You're just digging yourself deeper and deeper,

342
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:41,620
and I'm not even pushing at this point. And with people having this negative perception,

343
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:47,060
people decided that it was time to start digging, and digging, and digging, and whatever Alinity

344
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:52,420
was being framed as in PewDiePie's original video was nothing compared to what follows.

345
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:57,620
Showing your underwear on stream, that's our fault, right? And then clicking on full screen

346
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:02,660
right after. Bending over with your butt on camera, that's our fault, right? You're just

347
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:08,420
looking at your butt hair in this video, not doing anything else. Eating a popsicle down your throat

348
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:13,620
on camera, that's our fault, right? Because you had a sore in your mouth, that's why you did it,

349
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:19,700
right? Oh, you're just playing games with the shortest skirt ever. That's our fault for having

350
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:24,420
looking at it in any sexual way, right? Oh guys, I am just adjusting my camera right now,

351
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:29,460
I'm completely unaware of what else is going on. If you have any sort of sexual intention towards

352
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:35,140
this, that's our fault. Oh, sorry guys, I'm just pushing my bra together to show how a push-up

353
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:40,580
bra works. That's your fault for seeing anything sexual in that. How dare you.

354
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:45,140
Essentially, Alinity attempted to conduct a mud-slinging campaign against Felix,

355
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:49,620
retweeting various negative tweets about him, which gave PewDiePie the impetus to bite back

356
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,620
with his own claims. And remember that old clip about her not wanting to talk about her

357
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:59,780
relationships? Oh dear, oh dear. There's this one clip where she very publicly admits to committing

358
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:05,940
marriage fraud, that she moved to Colombia and married this guy, just so she could move

359
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:12,740
to Canada. You don't make any money, you work a lot. So I was like, no, hell no. So I married

360
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:21,060
a Canadian, and they came to Canada, and then I divorced them. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

361
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:26,420
Unfortunately, Alinity was outnumbered, both numerically and logically, and somehow became

362
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:31,460
the single greatest target and villain at the same time. How do you manage something like that?

363
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:36,580
Surely if you are the target, people will at least give you some sympathy. Well.

364
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:49,460
When reflecting on a situation, we are typically sympathetic to people who become targets of the

365
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:54,420
internet mob. Not because they haven't committed any wrongdoings, but because eventually you

366
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:59,620
reflect on it and wonder how much of the drama they actually instigated, and how many people

367
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:04,420
were just blindly hating them without asking any questions. However, with this situation,

368
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:08,980
there has been very little sympathy in any reflection, and this is mainly because Alinity,

369
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:13,460
despite receiving backlash from the fanbase of one of the largest creators on the platform,

370
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:18,980
managed to instigate almost every single instance. When you throw something at a person,

371
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:23,540
they might see it as giving them license to fling back, and this is exactly what happened

372
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:28,500
with Alinity. She tried to punch below the belt by talking about PewDiePie's other controversies,

373
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:33,620
and PewDiePie spoke about her other controversies with much greater impact. There are a few reasons

374
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:38,420
that this yielded much more impact. Firstly, PewDiePie has a greater fanbase, but also a

375
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:43,700
much greater social media presence all in all. Alinity, in spite of her following on Twitch,

376
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:49,060
only had around 67,000 Twitter followers at the time of the controversy, which is slightly low

377
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:54,900
compared to PewDiePie's then 16 million followers. Let's just say this led to some ratios.

378
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,740
It also didn't help that PewDiePie has been the centre of attention for ages, and therefore

379
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:03,220
nothing that people said was actually news to anyone, and therefore he wasn't being really

380
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,940
exposed other than through trivial rumours. Alinity, on the other hand, as a streamer who

381
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:12,820
hasn't been involved in a drama that size, has all this dirty laundry that many people

382
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:16,580
haven't seen go through the watch, and when people brought it into the light,

383
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:21,940
it was news, and was pretty damn bad. This led to her becoming one of the internet's least

384
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,340
favourite people, and when confronted regarding this, she once again flipped responsibility of

385
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:43,460
her comments to people reporting her to the authorities, and although I probably wouldn't

386
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:47,700
advise reporting her, in spite of the evidence, you know, people chat their shit to try and

387
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:52,500
embolden themselves in front of their audience, it's hard to feel sympathetic to her complaints.

388
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,140
Bragging about a crime in which there is a victim will never be overwhelmingly popular when people

389
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:01,540
look at it with a critical eye. PewDiePie did have a lot of responsibility in the handling of

390
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:05,700
the situation, which could have been misused greatly, however many people would agree that

391
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,540
he should be able to argue his case as well, particularly in response to anything that

392
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:14,260
Alinity says, and because he was constantly on the retaliation, this gave him the opportunity

393
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:19,620
to know what Alinity had said and respond with more impact. Another huge issue was that Alinity

394
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:24,820
just went from one argument to another, basically taking consecutive L's on every single perspective,

395
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,540
her points of view were just an incoherent mess.

396
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:48,980
She continuously argued the notion of responsibility, while taking none of her own.

397
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:54,020
PewDiePie continuously offered a ceasefire, and she rejected it, maybe because she thought if

398
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:58,660
the harassment became bad enough, it would help make a case for her victimhood, however because

399
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:03,780
she was seen as instigating every fan defending PewDiePie or attacking her, was seen to be doing

400
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:08,260
it because of her own statements, rather than because of anything PewDiePie actually said or

401
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:13,220
did. To add to this, the only real point of view that she could argue herself as aggrieved on was

402
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:18,500
the perspective of sexism, now in a way you could argue that the gender perspective could give her

403
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:23,700
a hard time, there is a lot of prejudice, but as said, many people would suspect that actually her

404
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:28,420
gender gave her an advantage, especially on Twitch, particularly given the genre that she had

405
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:32,100
rose to prominence in. And then, to top it all off, she just said this,

406
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:57,460
And this irritated a lot of people, because as mentioned earlier, everyone knows about how

407
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:01,860
Twitch treat many streamers, how harshly they enforce many of their guidelines, to have this

408
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:07,380
person breach the same terms of service and not face any consequences at all was enraging, and

409
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:12,180
undermined any argument of disenfranchisement coming from her. Throughout it all, she delivered

410
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:17,060
her words with the same very dispassionate tone, and although it's important that you don't let

411
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:21,300
your emotions interfere with your points of view too much, because her arguments seemed emotionally

412
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:26,260
based, when paired with her delivery, it just seemed very uncomfortable, and plain manipulative

413
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:33,620
for many people. I felt very upset. This has upset me a lot. She always has a trend of continuously

414
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:38,660
attacking people's previous prejudices as a way to deflect current criticism, and although people

415
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:43,380
may be harsher on her, for sure, it doesn't mean she is above the criticism. Later on in the same

416
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:47,700
stream, she used people's least favourite racial slur, the one beginning with the letter N of

417
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:52,020
course, and once again, although not the most malicious manner given Twitch's extremely harsh

418
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:56,980
enforcement of the guidelines, and the context of it being in the same stream, this irritated a lot

419
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:01,540
of people, and further elevated how untouchable she seemed to perceive herself as.

420
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,780
You coming not saying that ever again? Okay.

421
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:11,220
Well, I'm part black, so I don't see why the- like, why would they say that?

422
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:16,900
Well, I wouldn't say- I'm like 10% black, I don't think I- whatever.

423
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,940
Did she just use the Keemstar defence? Oh no.

424
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:25,620
This does not seem good. You'd find very few neutral actors who defend her behaviour at this point.

425
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:31,700
But wait, there was one more publication willing to stand up against PewDiePie. Wait, no, nevermind

426
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:36,100
it's vice. I did actually respond to this article briefly last year in a video about Mr. Beast.

427
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:40,980
To sum it up, it's really bad and arguably one of the worst cases of decontextualisation there has

428
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:45,940
been for a while. Although the concern of making sure that you do not frame any victim as asking

429
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:50,500
for it is a concern that we should all pay attention to, I do not think the slippery slope

430
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:55,060
from Felix's comments were there. And yes, for some reason, having the backing of a mainstream

431
00:35:55,060 --> 00:36:00,260
outlet wasn't a huge support winner. Alinity was being attacked on nearly every platform,

432
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:04,580
and her support just wasn't following through to many corners of the internet.

433
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:09,620
However, she never backed down. Why wouldn't she? Let's ask that question.

434
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:24,420
When someone becomes involved in drama, one of the most constraining factors ultimately comes

435
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:30,180
down to your audience. I spoke about it right at the start. When UI twitched Dreamer, whose appeal

436
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:35,780
is partly your appearance, decorum is a liberty, and Alinity recognised that. Normally when you

437
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:40,180
encounter drama where you receive substantial amounts of criticism, you would lose support.

438
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:44,820
But if you head over to Alinity's social blade, you'll see that her growth was largely unaffected

439
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:50,260
by the drama. That was exactly the same with Pokimane 2. Despite being criticised by the

440
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:55,620
commentators very harshly, when it came down to the numbers, there was very little change.

441
00:36:55,620 --> 00:37:00,420
Therefore, if she didn't actually feel like apologising, well, she had very little to lose

442
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:05,620
by not. She's in drama with someone who, in spite of their prominence, can't really cause any damage

443
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:10,180
to the channel or the income that she's receiving, partly due to the fact that she's on Twitch,

444
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:14,580
and partly because her appeal is separate from her credibility. No one expected her

445
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:18,980
to be the voice of reason, although many people would agree Twitch should be treating people

446
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:24,340
equally. Unfortunately, that's not how it works, and as sad as it is, the drama isn't the greatest

447
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:29,700
deal in the grand scheme of things. She had who she needed to on her side, who derived benefit

448
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:34,420
from her entertainment that isn't compromised by the drama, and therefore they want to keep

449
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:39,940
watching her. This gave her license to basically behave how she wanted to, and she did. However,

450
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:44,900
there was one thing that was separate to her fanbase, and that was the other source of support

451
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:49,620
that was indispensable for her, Twitch themselves. Many people have argued that Twitch should have

452
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:54,340
punished Alinity for her conduct, yet Twitch haven't, and it appeared that she had them in

453
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:59,860
her back pocket, and once the drama died down, most people have no reason to persist. There were

454
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:05,540
more pressing dramas that caught people's interest, and the online community isn't exactly known for

455
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:10,660
their attention span. However, there was one thing that would last, the impression that she left on

456
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:15,620
many people. Impressions aren't important if we never have to come into contact with them again,

457
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:20,340
and for a good year we didn't. There was a brief situation at the end of the year where she accused

458
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:26,420
another streamer of sexual harassment, and provided some corroborating screenshots. The other streamer

459
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:30,740
openly denied these claims, and retained a lawyer. People would have been foolish to drag her over

460
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:35,780
this because they are quite serious, and it seems that it's still an open case, but there have been

461
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:41,060
no updates since around November last year, so I guess we'll just wait on that one. However, it was

462
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:46,740
not the end of community run-ins with Alinity, and everything that had happened in the past would now

463
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:51,780
come back to bite her. In the past, many people had accused Alinity of throwing her pussy around.

464
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:56,820
However, few would have been able to call how literal this phrase would be applied, because on

465
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:03,140
the 18th of June 2019, Alinity was doing what she normally does on Twitch, streaming, and her cat

466
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:10,020
obstructed her gamer view, and like any sane normal human being, you don't let the pets get in the way.

467
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:15,460
She responded by taking the cat, and throwing it over her head fairly abruptly. This clip began to

468
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:19,620
spread throughout the internet, and like the internet, they then found more clips regarding

469
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:25,380
Alinity, and her cat, and her other pets, including this very charming one where she decides that her

470
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:30,420
cat's in the mood for a cheeky drink, a nice cocktail of vodka and saliva. It then hit reporters

471
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:36,260
like Keemstar, and then PETA, the controversial animal rights group with questionable hot takes.

472
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:41,300
However, the take this time was pretty al dente. They were not satisfied with Alinity's behaviour,

473
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:47,140
and they wanted Twitch to take action. Like Mount Vesuvius, the dormant community erupted into a

474
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:52,020
united call of criticism. This was really the perfect opportunity, because there was no way that

475
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:57,460
Alinity could put the blame on the cat, and therefore there was no defined enemy for Alinity

476
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:02,340
to victimise herself against. In light of these claims and the corroborating footage, her local

477
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:08,100
animal protection society launched an investigation into her contact with the animal, and it was not

478
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:14,260
looking good for her. So what does she do? Well, she did the unthinkable, she apologised.

479
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:21,780
In these tweets, she apologises for her quote lapses in judgement, and commits to complying

480
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:27,540
with any animal abuse investigation, while stating that her cats do live in a loving environment.

481
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:32,180
This could have been over, this could have been it, but people weren't prepared to let it go,

482
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:36,820
and it was even less likely to have been let go when Twitch decided that they weren't going to

483
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:42,100
take any action at all. On first glance, maybe a warning would suffice, but new evidence came

484
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:46,820
forward regarding Twitch's treatment of streamers. One clip regarding another streamer who went by

485
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:52,500
the name of Bebe, who was seemingly banned for 14 days following a similar incident in which she

486
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:57,940
tossed a cat over her head. She put out a statement regarding this hypocrisy where she seems to confirm

487
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:02,660
that a temporary ban was placed on her. This video comparison relating to it then spread fairly

488
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:08,500
quickly, and caused further outrage among critics. Then the videos came, they came fast, and they came

489
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:13,780
hard. Harping on Alinity for her behaviour and her privilege, and attacking Twitch for their double

490
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:18,660
standards, there was not really much defending to be done, and although some people had actually

491
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:23,860
defended her actions, few people could actually defend Twitch if they gave her another pass,

492
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:28,180
especially with all her previous actions and comments that Twitch is giving her exemptions

493
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:33,060
from any actual retribution. People are reaching the stage where they ask how much more would a

494
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:38,260
person like Alinity need to do to actually see any action taken against her. The weird thing is,

495
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:42,100
I don't think this would have been a huge controversy if she'd never been involved in

496
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:46,660
the controversies in the previous year. And in a way, if you're a stubborn person, it might feel

497
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:51,700
better to stand your ground, even if everyone hates you. If you can retain your fan base while

498
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:56,900
still being a little belligerent, then it might feel validating. However, when your future relies

499
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:01,300
on the fact that you're walking the line between what might be acceptable and what might not be,

500
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:07,780
then people will obviously see these situations as an opportunity to call on you to face repercussions,

501
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:12,820
and those calls will not go away. Nonetheless, there is also inside information that we might

502
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:17,540
not be aware of. One of Twitch's heads of media put out a tweet where they stated that they were

503
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:21,860
in favour of Alinity's suspension from the platform for a certain amount of time, but

504
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:27,300
ultimately had no authority to make that call, which was, to be frank, rather concerning. On top

505
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:32,340
of this, much like the racial slur she had made, this was no longer talking about suggestive

506
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:38,100
behaviour that made her and others popular. This was unambiguous. This is not something that they

507
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:43,860
would have set any standard for other streamers in the genre. This is a blatant exception made by

508
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:48,820
Twitch, and the fact that she's the beneficiary of this has only made her more unpopular.

509
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,980
How bad is it? Let's have a discussion.

510
00:42:50,980 --> 00:43:02,660
When someone commits a wrongdoing, we like to see them held accountable for their actions.

511
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:07,220
It's a simple enough notion, and when we feel like they have paid their dues, then we might be open

512
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:12,420
to not hating them anymore, depending on their conduct and how they feel about it. Sometimes,

513
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:17,460
if an authority fails to take action, we might hate the authority more than the actual person.

514
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:22,340
In this instance, if this had been an isolated incident, it might be a scenario of hating the

515
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:27,060
game rather than the player. However, with the fact that Alinity had openly admitted to being

516
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:32,420
on somewhat chummy relationships with the Twitch authority, it basically made her part of the game

517
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:38,100
that many people absolutely loathe. Alinity isn't ignorant of what she's doing, she's completely

518
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:43,140
knowledgeable of the privilege that she has obtained, and in many ways highly indulgent

519
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:47,700
of it, provoking breaches of the guidelines that she must be aware of. On one stream,

520
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:52,900
she takes a picture of her buttocks, with the camera shot reflecting onto the stream.

521
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:56,980
No action was taken. In two other streams, she was reported to bring up porn on the screen,

522
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:01,700
however these were accidental, so she was let off, which is fair enough, but still something

523
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:06,180
to take note of, and when called out on this treatment, she is regularly attempted to make

524
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:11,780
herself the victim, from her position, and although the stereotypical branding of a twat I can

525
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:17,380
understand might irks on, and even put them down in a way, it feels like a small drawback in a role

526
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:22,500
that is clearly derived due to many benefits of the market, and many benefits of the doubt,

527
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:26,900
that many would agree you do not deserve. Honestly, if Twitch punished her at this point,

528
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:31,460
she might catch a bit less flak in the future, but because Twitch have failed to take action

529
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:36,740
in the past, people will now be looking for reasons to campaign for her suspension on the platform.

530
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:41,620
Now there are two reasons why this may not matter to Alinity, first one being if she completely

531
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:46,340
avoids these controversies in the future, now this is slightly doubtful given her record of

532
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:51,300
controversies, and how abrasive she seems to be, whether by impulse or calculation, she does seem

533
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:55,620
to annoy people, and on top of this, whenever something occurs, it seems to provoke another

534
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:59,700
wave of people searching for other related incidents that piles on pressure for Twitch to

535
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:04,740
take action, so I doubt this will be the last time we hear of her. The second condition is that Twitch

536
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:10,260
actually are so tight with Alinity, they will never take any action no matter what. I think

537
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:14,980
this is a more plausible condition, but it would certainly depend on the extent that Alinity pushes

538
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:19,620
the boundaries, the only rational reason that I perceive they keep people like her on the site

539
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:24,420
during these incidents is due to the possible prospect of encouraging competition. Obviously,

540
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:28,980
that excludes other theories like deep personal connections or possible blackmail, although the

541
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:33,060
evidence that there is some deeper link is quite compelling in itself, given that many streamers

542
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:37,060
have reported that they've been banned for talking about the incident alone, and there are many

543
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:41,540
rumours and claims that there does seem to be some coherence to. The question is, when a competitor

544
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:46,100
comes along, and people can judge a platform on the basis of morality rather than practicality,

545
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:51,140
who will Twitch back? I do wonder how much longer it'd take for Twitch to feel like they've been

546
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:55,860
losing more than they're gaining from keeping Alinity on the platform without any punishment.

547
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:01,140
Honestly, when you do nothing, it's hard to get people to boycott your platform, but this

548
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:06,100
animal maltreatment thing seems to be the closest she's ever been to actually being impacted by

549
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:10,740
controversy, and even then she's remained in the green because people don't feel bad supporting

550
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:15,460
someone whose appeal isn't inextricably linked to how they treat animals, and unfortunately,

551
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:20,340
the fact that her audience nor Twitch is prepared to react, she'll probably continue to behave

552
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:25,780
recklessly. Now, to be fair, if the authorities who are investigating this animal maltreatment case

553
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:32,020
give her a bit of a scare, wait no, never mind, if the authority finds this, then I can't act as if

554
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:38,020
I have a greater insight to the home life of a cat, but I don't really understand how they can

555
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:45,140
say this didn't have quote malicious intent, while throwing a cat over the head, or spitting vodka,

556
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:51,620
like okay, she didn't intend to cause any harm, but it's still reckless and stupid, and a bad thing

557
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:56,900
to do on screen. I don't think that was the point that people were trying to make, and you know

558
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:01,300
what? I don't want to see her lose her pets over these incidents, I think that would be a

559
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:06,740
disproportionate reaction, but as reports go, you really downplay the instance, I mean you don't

560
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:12,340
even say what they were, I'm not gonna give her stick if Alinity pledges to treat her pets better,

561
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:17,380
and I do believe she has the capacity to, even if it's just for the sake of protecting her career,

562
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:21,300
but it's important that people are actually informed of what a person has done, so they

563
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:25,540
can judge it from an informed perspective, but regardless of how she treats her pets,

564
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:30,260
when it comes to treating commentators and other creators who may give her criticism,

565
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:35,700
particularly audiences, Alinity sees no consequence from being defensive, abrasive,

566
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:40,100
and confrontational, so chances are when these situations transpire in the future, she will

567
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:45,540
continue to be that way, she has no motivation to change, and until she does that, she will be that

568
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:51,700
way, and I mean ultimately being rather unpleasant doesn't preface you not being right, you could be

569
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:56,820
unpleasant, and completely right, it's just Alinity wasn't, in my opinion she has been

570
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:02,100
completely wrong, and her doubling down on it has only been done out of personal pride, where there

571
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:06,420
are any behavioural causes that play into it, whether her mental health may be involved is

572
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:11,700
another question, but regardless, her actions and responses to criticism give off the impression

573
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:16,660
that she does not understand the responsibility that she has misused as a public figure, and thus

574
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:20,980
does attract rightful criticism from the basis that she might hurt someone else again due to

575
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:26,020
that lack of understanding. As for Twitch, I think they should have taken action against her,

576
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:30,340
given all the liberties they permit, however this seems to be a constant problem with all

577
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:34,980
larger platforms, that anyone with significant clout receives special treatment, while people

578
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:39,780
at the bottom are constantly being weeded out by the moderators, everyone's been the victim of that

579
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:44,180
unfortunately, although I really do question what they would have lost by temporarily banning

580
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:49,460
Alinity this time round, it's not really related to the market or a standard that you might set,

581
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:54,500
having a rule for not throwing cats seems fair enough, and I really doubt many people would have

582
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:59,860
sided with animal cruelty, and I really doubt that Alinity would have been able to rile up a narrative

583
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:05,860
of injustice, or move a majority of the market over to a competing platform, YouTube isn't quite

584
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:10,820
equipped enough to win over a lot of the Twitch streamers, and Alinity doesn't seem like a person

585
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:16,260
with a huge influence over other Twitch names, it does really make me wonder why if there's

586
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:21,140
something a bit more personal going on, it would not surprise me, either way Twitch's continuous

587
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:25,860
protection of Alinity with no repercussion at all will continue to rub people the wrong way,

588
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:30,020
and the fact that Alinity is very aware of it will make her much more contemptible for people

589
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:35,060
who observe these situations. As for the viewers, there will be many people who unconditionally

590
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:40,420
support her, I have a hunch that there are also many people who acknowledge her character slightly

591
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:45,140
flawed, but enjoy her content nonetheless, and that will continue unless she does something

592
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:51,460
really really bad, but I don't think she would go that far. And what about me, her critic?

593
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:57,140
All these critics? Well, once upon a time, the hatred she may have received may have been due to

594
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:03,060
the sneering elitism towards the type of audience she appealed to, however, five years on, and she

595
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:08,020
has given people many additional reasons to dislike her. At this point, there can be little doubt that

596
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:12,500
Alinity's position of privilege, pride, and pernition has made her one of the most unpopular

597
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:17,380
persons on the platform, but as long as she's on that platform, people are powerless, and damn

598
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:22,980
right she knows it. But there's one thing guaranteed, they will be waiting. So that was

599
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:29,780
the video, I hope you really enjoyed it, I had fun, a lot of fun, this was a long one, but sometimes

600
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:36,260
they need to be long to revisit all these ideas. I'd love to give a big shout out to the editors,

601
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:42,180
once again, I'm sure they did a great job, I could never understate that. I'm really looking

602
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:46,260
forward to seeing the finished product, and go and check them out and send them some love on that

603
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:52,340
behalf. I need to give a big shout out to my Patreons, the $10 Patreons plus are on screen

604
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:58,180
right now, but I do have some special, special people that I need to give a special, special

605
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:06,740
shout out to. These Patreons include my $50 Patreons, Caroline, Nico Deschamps, Rocket Ralph,

606
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:14,820
Sarah Elizabeth, Sumhala Baloo, and the Specter Angel. Three, $300 Patreons, Brandon Junck,

607
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:21,060
Adam Michael, and Christopher Karrasz. It's a very nice name, Christopher Karrasz. I think Christopher

608
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:26,260
Karrasz is the newest Patreon, so welcome to the crew, we've got a nice little entourage pulling up

609
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:31,700
right now that I'm very proud of, and I appreciate all the support you guys give. If you want to

610
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:38,580
reach me, you can contact me on Twitter, at The Right Opinion, Facebook too, I've also got a Discord,

611
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:43,060

612
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:47,940
Otherwise, I don't think I have too much else to add, I hope you guys are doing well as always,
