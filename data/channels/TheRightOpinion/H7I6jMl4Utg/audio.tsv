0	5760	The home of a twat with too much free time and I thought I'd start off today's video with a story because who doesn't love a
5760	9860	Good story. Anyway, where were we? I went to VidCon this year
9860	14980	I had a great time and met loads of top lads and handsome chaps and if I did have the chance to meet you
14980	16220	I hope I see you again
16220	20660	And if I didn't I will be at conventions in the future hopefully and it would be cool to see you there
20660	25020	I was inside one of these halls at VidCon as the roaming fees are absolutely insane
25020	28940	I had to rely on Wi-Fi and there were only certain places I could attain it
29000	31400	This hall was one of those places, but it was fairly late
31400	37260	The hall was fairly empty and I was messaging people to try and ascertain their location so we could go and chill then I saw
37260	39540	Something the doors opening I turned my attention
39880	46020	Lo and behold there stood Billy the fridge and there sat in his mobility scooter boogie2988
46020	49500	They were stopped by a fan and they told them that they were on their way to a meeting
49500	52020	So I decided against intercepting them myself
52020	55280	I am a courteous gentleman for the very few who are unaware
55380	58940	Boogie2988 is a youtuber known for a range of videos
58940	62660	He has this persona Francis, which is a satirical take on gamers
62660	68540	And then this other set of videos which discusses more deeper and personal topics often and even some drama
68540	73140	So I saw those lads I let them go. I didn't have anything to speak to them about regardless
73140	77380	I mean what could have possibly unfolded over a few days of banter at VidCon?
77380	80280	Well due to my lack of internet in places
80280	84740	I paid less attention to the internet and when I did it was typically at unsociable hours
84740	89880	So when someone asked me what I thought of the boogie situation, my initial response was wait. What?
89920	90420	Yes
90420	96900	Apparently at the time that I saw him a situation was actually at the peak of unfolding one very interesting discussion
96900	100100	Which was to result in an eventual apology from the man in question
100100	108020	I'll explain the basic situation before going into a bit more of a exploration phase the predicament that arose wasn't actually sourced at VidCon
108020	113080	It was sourced briefly before VidCon when boogie made an appearance on the h3 podcast, you know
113080	115720	The podcast hosted by h3. It's in the name
115720	120160	But anyhow, he was on there and they were just shooting the shit and the topic of VidCon
120880	124260	2017 came up an event that I will be covering in more depth later
124260	130360	But to summarize he hosted a panel with video game feminist Anita Sarkeesian and at the end of the panel
130360	134880	He said something that she objected to and this led to a confrontation and subsequent discussion
134880	142300	However, during the discourse about this situation on the h3 podcast boogie said something that people took objection to he made a few comments one
142420	145120	Notoriously about gay marriage that some felt was in poor form
145260	151500	This led to a lot of back and forth between boogie and these critics and eventually led him to retracting his original statement
151500	155700	This inevitably was followed by accusations that boogie was fenced sitting some for the comments
155700	159600	He made and then some for the subsequent retraction. However, this isn't really new
159600	166660	In fact boogie has been in this position times before even the original situation where he made a video on meeting Anita Sarkeesian
166660	170620	He received these same allegations. Unfortunately, you cannot please everyone
170660	176740	However, generally I do believe that people should stand for what they believe in and shouldn't just cater to every side as although these
176740	183100	Things often bank on some sort of subjectivity. There is a societal context that may make a certain choice preferable
183100	189060	So today what I'm going to be doing is my own little personal investigation into whether boogie can be considered a fence-sitter
189560	194260	Initiating with a little exploration discussion and then reapplying it to the situation in question
194260	197500	So we can hopefully come to a bit more of a steadfast conclusion on it
197500	203120	So what I did is I pulled up a selection of boogie videos over the last few years in which he covered drama some more
203180	208820	Contentious than others to try and decipher if he's been employing any tactics that we would be able to pin down to fence-sitting
208940	211980	Handering or anything else. Maybe I was pleasantly surprised
211980	218360	I found to be a man of strong principle just of elaborate reasoning and the proneness to being persuaded or maybe I just found it
218360	221940	A facade for someone who is just trying to please every demographic
221940	226520	I watched a few boogie videos on drama in my time, but generally I do not follow him too closely
226520	232520	So although some of these were revisits most of them were looked at with a fresh eye. So without further ado, let's get to it
241100	245560	So I watched a selection of boogie videos and I have compiled a various range of
245820	252760	Observations and we'll go through them in a sort of chronological order. I started by watching his response to Nicole Arbors dear fat people
252760	257040	I found it an appropriate video to start on as I'd recently covered Nicole Arber myself
257040	262840	So I was wondering what he had to say about her defining classic and generally I think out of the videos
262840	267600	I watched it was the best one and I think it managed to demonstrate what boogie could be at his best
267880	273760	Taking a concrete stance while still being considerate of those that may disagree with him and attempting to appeal to them as well
273760	276040	That's something that I feel is very important
276040	281160	So I do actually think this was a strong video to look at for example saying that obesity shouldn't be indulged
281160	282560	But while still having that
282560	290160	Reservation that there are ways to be constructive about it and help people make that change in a way different to what Nicole Arber thought
290160	295560	Was preferable I followed this by taking a look at his Logan Paul video and he did not necessarily say anything
295560	301080	I disagree within that one as well and he definitely got it out soon enough to avoid the accusation of not bringing anything to the
301320	305840	Conversation however, this is why I outlined one of the defining features of boogies approach to drama
305840	309560	He tends to approach the video assuming that the person has good intentions
309640	314380	But now let me say, um, I do believe his intentions were good because if you look at the end of the video
314380	318680	He includes the suicidal national hotline number the same one. I included down below
319280	323240	He gave out the message that you are not alone that there are people here that will help
323240	328120	I think that's all good stuff Logan. If you do stuff like that, you're gonna have me at your back
328120	331280	I'm gonna be standing up there for you and I'm gonna be very proud of you. That's good stuff
331440	336000	Generally, I think that's a fine idea and it's one that I use regularly as a base for all
336000	341720	We should always approach the situation under the premise of reasonable doubt that we have reason to believe that someone has good
341800	344440	Intentions until there is enough proof to suggest otherwise
344480	350800	However, the problem comes around when you set that burden of proof to heavily this generally makes you to permitting of someone and may cause
350800	357720	You to view them positively even when their actions suggest otherwise and they may continue to take advantage of that case in point the fine
357720	365120	Brother situation I think given the level of evidence their behavior provided it show that their intentions were not entirely pure to say the least
365120	371480	However in boogies video he gave far too much benefit of the doubt to them despite the dangerous levels of corporatism in their idea
371480	376840	it also revealed one of the things that I think is one of the most credible criticisms to be levied against boogie and one that
376840	381960	I would definitely place forward myself instead of saying this is a bad idea. It should be stopped
381960	385360	He said well if it goes well, it'll be great for everyone
385360	387200	and if it doesn't it'll be a
387200	393240	disaster for everyone may turn out to be a good thing and I really hope that it does but the proof of the burden lands on
393400	397640	The fine brothers and they have to get this right because if they don't if they don't
397840	402320	There's gonna be hell to pay for all of us man, and nobody wants to pay this particular bill
402320	406760	And that's why people are mad which is something that can be said about a lot of plans
406760	411920	It represents what I call the whiskey problem. What's right opinion boogie isn't an alcoholic
411920	414560	Yeah, shut up you pleb and give me a moment to explain it
414560	418280	The if I whiskey argument is the ultimate fence sitters logic
418280	423520	It was called that because it was originally attributed to a speech made by a lawmaker on prohibition
423520	428720	I'm not gonna read it out. But there's the transcript if you want to pause it and put it in your cringe compilation
428720	433640	Anyhow, this isn't a far cry from what boogie was alluding to in his fine bros video
433640	438520	And I think this follows through from his assumption. They may have had these plans with the best of intentions
438520	444540	But although there are many possibilities there is only one reality when these plans are put to the test
445180	448940	Fortunately the fine bros pulled the plug on the idea due to the initial backlash
448940	455620	I think that in that situation given the circumstances take a firm stance against it very strongly was the right thing to do
455620	461500	I think waiting to find out how it goes is a bad approach in these situations and the it could go well or badly
461660	467540	Is a cop-out position, especially when the projections appear to say that it could go very badly
467540	473520	It's important to take a stronger stance to make sure this idea is not continued with at least in its current state
473840	477740	Fortunately, everyone else managed to stop the fine bros though. It is food for thought
478040	481820	There are people on these platforms that do not have good intentions
481820	484880	I do not think it is a bad thing giving people chances
484880	490680	But there has to be a line drawn and the problem is if you are too permitting to these people you end up letting them
490680	496960	Get too far and then you end up being walked all over which conveniently takes us to our next point the Anita video
496960	502640	This upload is one of his most disliked videos. This was the original take that provoked the podcast discussion
502680	508200	This definitely outlined another key problem with boogies attitude that a lot of people have picked up on his
508360	513960	Constant focus on pleasing people now. Once again, the concept of this in moderation is perfectly fine
514040	516720	Nothing wrong with being empathetic towards others
516720	523120	However, a lot of people pointed out that he came across as far too much like he was policing himself to the point of over
523400	528340	Sensitivity now the story that boogie told in this instance didn't necessarily come to a bad ending
528340	531700	They had a discussion and it sounded fairly constructive
531900	538300	However, generally I don't think it was the outcome that annoyed people because this is not an outcome that would occur every time
538300	543320	I think it was boogies ethos the irritator some people it creates two problems in my mind
543320	546580	If you show yourself as someone who tries too hard to please other people
546700	552820	Then you leave yourself prone to having people who will make unreasonable demands and when you say no to them
552820	556280	They will become upset and aggravated and you will buckle
556360	563540	Also, if you focus too much on pleasing people it becomes hard to stand for anything in particular because plenty of people disagree on topics
563540	570420	and although there are plenty of reasonable people being afraid to upset the unreasonable ones will often make you overly cautious and may make you
570420	572420	Not really stand for anything
575080	580840	Now this isn't to say that it's good to be the opposite being a big old bellend doesn't necessarily work either
580840	586880	But Anita is a great example of someone who in spite of my many criticisms of her and her attitude
586880	592720	She's not afraid to make them feel uncomfortable and that is one thing that I will stand by we should not always
593000	598320	Focus on making people comfortable. There are definitely standards of conduct, but you can't pander too much either
598600	604000	Sometimes opinions will be said that make others uncomfortable and I think boogie worries too much about that
604000	606880	I watched a lot of boogie videos where he discusses his own
607240	613520	Experiences and his own mental health issues and I think his positions or drama likely arise from the fact that he has been so
613520	621240	Exposed in his earlier life to a torrent of negative abuse that he really wants to avoid that confrontation and I completely understand that
621240	623000	But I think even with that in mind
623000	630000	There are definitely ways you can handle drama in a more opinionated fashion and being able to stop these things while still avoiding the vitriol
630000	632720	Of the online hordes, I mean you're on the internet
632720	634920	You're gonna receive hate regards of where you stand
634920	638800	especially when your boogie sighs and he knows that and I think an important part is how you
638920	642000	Respond to hate and when the hate is a bit higher than normal
642000	644940	It's important not to backtrack just to appease the masses
644940	650280	I want to clarify that I don't think there's an issue with admitting you're wrong sometimes in fact being prepared to admit
650280	652560	You're wrong is an important part of any discourse
652560	654720	However, it's the reasons for admitting you're wrong
654720	660160	If you see someone's logic and you understand that point of view then you may want to change your mind
660200	666780	However boogie often seems to backtrack to appease the number of people who object to him rather than their own logic
666780	674040	He made a video in response to grade-a under a's allegations that Matthew Santoro was plagiarizing his videos now in the video
674040	677760	I can understand how some people may have interpreted it as a defense
677760	680820	But I personally found it quite a decent look at the situation
680820	687120	Although not all of his points were entirely relevant to the discussion that I feel many were trying to have his approach seemed fairly reasoned
687120	690920	However, at the time everyone was very riled up from the situation
690920	695960	Which is quite a common phenomenon and one that I might cover in the future what I'm going to say next
695960	702600	I can't necessarily verify as the video he claimed was unlisted has now been removed entirely and I had to watch a re upload
702600	708680	But he likely received criticism that he was being too soft on Santoro and although he was definitely being very soft
708680	710960	It wasn't anything out of the ordinary to him
710960	715920	So even when presenting his defense he presented the arguments as third person while his conclusion
716280	717800	Actually seemed pretty reasoned
717800	722440	He concluded that Santoro's was probably fair use but he could still see that it incorporated
722700	728360	Plagiaristic elements and that was still shitty and it had no place on his channel and he should definitely be held to account on that
728520	730520	The following day he made a video
730560	735000	Apologizing saying that he screwed up now in hindsight this may have pleased the critics initially
735000	738920	But a lot of the comments now say that he didn't need to make the video and I agree with them
739220	745240	Interpretation is a significant part of your content often how you present it will depend on how other people interpret it
745240	751160	However, there are always people who will interpret it from an exaggerated point of view either against them or against you
751160	754000	That number will increase in reactionary environments
754000	760680	people are provoked by drama and this emotion may affect their reasoning boogie has to pay mind that and avoid being pushed over and
760680	767520	That's the thing boogie often judges himself on the public response that can lead to two problems in dramatic situations where response may be
768040	771960	Disproportionate firstly if you side with the angry crowd in an attempt to gain popular support
772160	779280	Time will transpire and your anger will be shown as overblown and this will undermine your credibility as an arbitrator for the community on the other
779280	782360	Hand if you avoid that and you face immediate backlash
782360	788280	You may have the tendency to buckle and give in to the angry mob which will frame you as someone who's more focused on catering
788280	790760	To opinions rather than having your own generally
790760	797260	I think it's really easy to be caught up in crowd outrage and the community of commentary has been no stranger to that even I
797260	800760	On occasion have done it but long term it pays off to be rational
800760	805440	Which may even include having the unpopular opinion sometimes and that's something that boogie does
805560	809800	Occasionally seem afraid of and that might stem from the fear of receiving negative feedback
809800	813160	But you can't measure your opinions on the like to dislike ratio
813160	816280	Which is also why in spite of the problems with this video on Anita
816280	821960	I actually respect it for staying up in spite of the turbulent public response boogie seems to run a series of
822240	826220	Algorithms that create his opinions. This is something that a lot of us do subconsciously
826300	830740	However, we all lean on different rules different heuristics to help come to those conclusions
830740	835300	No one's thought process is entirely the same which is why we come to different conclusions
835300	840860	I think boogie's algorithms probably lean too much on those around him and their immediate emotional response
840860	847620	Which often leads to heavily mitigated opinions and occasional retractions rather than what may be best long term for people to hear
847620	849060	And I think that's the core issue
849060	853860	One of the greatest concerns might be the boogie always takes up the least offensive opinion
853860	860300	There is an algorithm that just focuses on how many people an opinion might offend and how deeply they are offended
860300	865140	So even in a situation like the Anita one where his video wasn't necessarily popular
865140	869460	Although a lot of people disagree with his point of view none of them really held it against him
869460	874620	Which may be something boogie's paying attention to and although his opinions aren't unreasonable in a way
874620	876620	I think that I and many others like
876980	880660	Justification for one's opinion to be more than just an attempt to please others
880780	883820	You cannot afford to become too reliant on your environments
883820	888960	This leads us to our latest situation one that showcased a lot of these problems and a few new ones
894340	897500	Now before I watched the video I actually checked out the tweets
897900	903660	Insinuating the drama it seems there were two points of interest the point that toxicity on both sides is something that should aim to be
903660	906460	Avoided died down pretty quickly. There was a bit of a backlash
906500	911780	But he dealt with it fairly competently and in all fairness if you were following this drama in real time
911780	916460	Then you might be mistaken to think that it had all died down after the couple days following the video release
916460	921060	He addressed this initial point and it was laid to rest. So what exactly revived it?
921060	926540	Well, eventually he tweeted about it more and more and then he got caught up in his comments about gay marriage
926540	930780	So after VidCon I sat down to watch the clip very conveniently uploaded
930780	933640	So I didn't have to trawl through the whole podcast papa bless
933640	939160	I could have just skipped to the specific comment. However context sake I thought I'd watch the whole thing after all
939160	943860	It wasn't that long and it might provide me with additional information omitted from the tweets
943860	948080	So I sat down and checked it out and the first six minutes passed without incident
948080	953340	He framed himself as a bit firmer than in the video the year before but otherwise it was fairly consistent
953340	958680	And then the sentence that must have lit the fuse was uttered like I always believed. Hey, we should have same-sex marriage
958680	962240	I love same-sex marriage. Let's do it. But the problem is we try to get it done right now
962880	964440	There's gonna be a huge backlash
964440	970460	Okay, so let's let's try to do it in 20 years in 10 years and let's see if we can avoid the backlash, right?
970460	972840	Let's just like slowly methodically change minds
972840	976920	I've always been a big fan of slowly methodically changing minds because I don't like it when gay people get killed
976920	982520	I don't like when somebody gets murdered for being gay. So let's not rile up the fucking crazies. Okay, let's just go slow and easy
982580	989200	Now this immediately struck me as off on the surface. It was just a terrible logical continuation from the previous talking point
989200	995420	He was saying that the way that Anita conduct herself was often too aggressive for many people to empathize with and thus made her cause
995420	1000680	Harder to support this is a reasonable point of view when you're trying to convince someone else of your opinion
1000800	1004760	Anita's technique is seldom the best and has led to a lot of ridicule
1004760	1011120	But to follow this line of reasoning about gay marriage seems strangely bizarre and let me explain why his point was that he would have
1011120	1017680	Rather waited for more people to have been convinced that gay marriage was a good idea rather than legalize it immediately to avoid backlash
1017800	1025380	This implies a follow from argumentative reasonability, but legalization doesn't really fall under that gay marriage carries a lot of weight behind it
1025380	1027920	But it's more of an outcome rather than a technique
1027920	1032920	Very few people are going to change their mind about the legalization of something while it's being
1033040	1036220	Legalized at that point the proof of the pudding is in the eating
1036220	1039720	It also doesn't help the boogie provided no time frame for his argument
1039720	1045460	He didn't say whether this waiting of 10 or 20 years was from a position of a few decades ago or from the present day
1045460	1051260	It was a very confusing example and one that in context does not hold up by doing this
1051260	1055300	He focused on policy rather than how people argued it and even though
1055500	1060560	Criticizing someone's delivery is a perfectly reasonable thing to do because it will annihilate people
1060560	1064580	It doesn't necessarily change the validity of a greater point that might attempt to be made
1064580	1071300	I do believe that it's smart to call people out to a championing causes in a destructive fashion and have regularly said that a good
1071300	1074140	Cause does not give you any right to behave like a twat
1074140	1081580	But an argument still has a stance regardless of who the proponent is which is funny as that was literally something that boogie just acknowledged
1081580	1087220	But okay in spite of this strange contextual logic. Does the argument have any merit on its own?
1087220	1093620	So his point was that he'd want to hold off legislation to avoid giving the crazy people ammunition to go crazy
1093740	1098220	But I personally think that's a poor line of reasoning generally speaking in modern times
1098220	1103580	There is a sect of the population that will always be a bit nuts and then you have the rest of the public who are
1103580	1108820	Fairly reasonable individuals. They may be wrong from time to time and they may be more divided on certain issues
1108820	1112180	But most of them generally are open-minded and ready to hear you out
1112420	1119820	The thing about legislation is although it's fairly affirmative if that particular legalization doesn't have a huge impact on an individual
1119820	1123280	They will judge a response on how proportionately appropriate it is
1123280	1129520	So if the crazies did go crazy in response many people would simply side against them and actually the case for gay marriage would just
1129520	1136400	Be strengthened. The problem is that when we're discussing gay marriage as boogie knowledge, these nutters are merely looking for ammunition
1136400	1141280	They're not looking to be convinced the people who are reasonable are those who we should be interested in
1141280	1145360	The only real concern we should avoid is making the crazy people look reasonable
1145360	1149280	But I don't think that's something that legislation would do nor is it something that it has done
1149280	1155400	In fact gay marriage support is an all-time high probably because people realized it didn't have much impact on their lives
1155400	1157720	If someone is out killing gay people
1157720	1163440	They may be a tough cookie to convince that gay marriage is worthwhile on top of that given the passivity of the legislation
1163760	1170320	It's not like education and discourse cannot continue after it. We can still carry on discussing these things
1170320	1175400	We can still carry on going out and trying to convince people and now we also have the idea that
1175640	1178680	Actually, it's working out quite well as further proof
1178720	1184360	one of the things that I personally have found so take this with a grain of salt is that many violent extremists are not
1184560	1189480	Extremists because they are strongly politically inclined but for other reasons surrounding their personal lives
1189480	1194840	And at that point what they do is to hijack a political notion that seems most justifiable to them
1194840	1199560	I think boogie views their intentions as purely political which is a fault from my point of view
1199560	1205200	Some people have heard all the arguments and are simply just not interested in engaging on your level
1205200	1208080	There is a difference between violence and action
1208080	1215600	Which is why many of those who argued against boogie reference a famous Martin Luther King comment King was very avidly against violence
1215600	1220680	But also wanted action so comments about not engaging on their level made by boogie are not all-encompassing
1220920	1225400	And should definitely require distinction when he makes them. Otherwise, it doesn't make much sense
1225880	1230040	Still this was only half the story because although I believe his position was greatly flawed
1230040	1234880	It was a bit of a throwaway comment that may have required some discussion but not the level that it received
1234960	1236080	He then made this tweet
1236080	1242400	Which is a curious one because I think he was still trying to address his initial comments that he'd already dealt with to be honest
1242400	1247360	But the replies tended to want to lean towards this gay marriage comment the one that was floored
1247360	1250040	He got wrapped up and he just couldn't stop digging
1250040	1255360	I thought I'd like to address this point on the side note because I think it's an interesting one why some people on the left
1255360	1259600	Are considered to be more vitriolic and this generally stems from ideological differences
1259600	1266080	The left are partly driven by the idea of justice what they view as an inherently moral concept to contrast the right would respond
1266080	1268920	Well, this is what works and in a way it is justice
1268920	1275960	Whereas the more judgmental perhaps even arrogant sets of the rights tend to view their detractors as ignorant requiring education
1275960	1283080	But not necessarily action the more judgmental sets of the left tend to view their detractors as immoral and immoral people can never act in
1283080	1284080	good faith
1284080	1288800	Education would not change that and therefore they are undeserving of a public platform
1288880	1294720	the tweet that said it all off is actually quite a good follow-on from this point because someone does say that gay marriage is a
1294720	1299080	Moral issue and I've discussed this but you can see why his reply may be ill-advised
1299360	1305560	What this led to is more and more tweets and then boogie said this which once again is a sign that he's kind of
1305760	1311500	Fence-sitting because in the space of a tweet he says yes fuck all these people but still let's try and persuade them
1311500	1314700	Which I feel demonstrates boogies very flip-flop approach
1314700	1320500	He's cursing these people off while still appealing to persuading them now if a few of these people are open to persuasion
1320500	1323960	They're probably not going to listen to someone who has just openly said fuck you
1323960	1327780	Boogie essentially creates a contradiction by trying to satisfy his critic
1327780	1335180	But in effect just defeats his own original points because unless he's proposing that other people do the educating which would really undermine the principle
1335180	1339200	Of practicing what you preach. He seems confused in himself what point he's trying to make
1339200	1343480	I also think boogie attempts to be a diplomat but can also regularly come across as
1344000	1347000	Condescending such as here on top of that one other thing
1347000	1350360	I've noticed is that he has a habit of appealing to his good actions
1350360	1355640	Which although may sometimes be in fair context can push the bounds moral appeals are fine
1355640	1359440	If they are relevant if someone's accusing you of not supporting certain causes
1359440	1362700	It may be fair to show evidence of supporting those said courses
1362700	1365300	However, when the moral area becomes a bit more gray
1365300	1371240	You have to tread carefully to avoid trivializing these good actions as well as the fact that you need to ask yourself
1371280	1378240	Do you need to promote your moral credentials to respond to someone's points? It's both about necessity and relevance
1378240	1381800	I just think boogie has too many people to appeal to at points
1381800	1387720	He calls them an outrage mob which many people would probably not like to say the least and then says I hear you loud and clear
1387720	1393120	And you can definitely make those two separate points, but without qualification of who and what in these situations
1393120	1397240	It might just irritate the good actors and give more ammunition to the bad actors
1397240	1402520	Something that you said you wouldn't want to do and then you make this comment which in effect seems harmless
1402520	1406600	But I'm a cynic and it's hard not to see it as an attack on an extremely small
1406680	1410800	Minority of people to try and gain kudos with people that may have been pissed off with you
1410800	1416880	I seldom saw anyone actually say this to him throughout the situation and this all seems particularly calculated
1417000	1422520	After a few days of back and forth he just retracted and apologized but it sort of came off as a can you lay off
1422520	1424520	Please rather than actual apology
1424560	1429640	He kind of shimmied himself into a damned if you do damned if you don't situation that if he retracted
1429640	1435400	He'd seem like he's giving in to people and if he doubled down he might be going against the reasoning some people presented him
1435400	1437800	So I don't want to give him too much more stick for this
1437800	1441320	But I wish he'd focus more on himself when making these statements
1447900	1452320	When boogie does something it can often come across with other people in mind
1452320	1459760	He always manages to include others. And although sometimes it might be justified. It often sounds like he's devolving responsibility
1459760	1462400	It just means it becomes hard for him to stand for anything
1462400	1470060	I think in these situations when you focus on so many different people it becomes so easy to contradict yourself that you undermine your own
1470320	1472660	Credibility buoy clearly wants to be reasonable
1472660	1477340	but reasons should be an equally internal process rather than relying solely on the
1477640	1484680	Reaction of those around you as it means that those around you can manipulate their reaction to possibly influence you when you're a public figure
1484680	1486680	There may be people who can call that out
1486920	1491480	however, too many people don't have that opportunity and I hear boogie's stories of
1492000	1495440	Exploitation and manipulation and it does pull on your heartstrings yet
1495440	1500080	I feel his public status is equally a blessing and a curse with one side
1500200	1504420	Protecting him from that manipulation happening again with the other exposing him for that
1504800	1509960	Vulnerability and you can't just allow your environment to shape you that easily because in the wrong situation
1509960	1515800	It makes you prone to being complicit to some very bad things. I think that's what concerns people fortunately for boogie
1515800	1521200	I think the weight of those around him is so evenly spread that it won't ever lead to anything particularly damaging
1521200	1526360	But I think it's important to keep in mind. We can always do better. We can always challenge our audience
1526360	1530560	So why shouldn't we I've had the same problem as boogie in the past particularly in video form
1530580	1534380	And what I found was that I had trouble coming to conclusions due to the amount of
1534740	1539460	Influential conditions and it's easy for things to be taken out of context and used against you
1539460	1544260	So it is important to qualify your statements to be clear to make sure people understand you
1544260	1550220	You can still gain respect from a majority of people and actually taking a harder stance against these bad things that may be happening
1550380	1556020	People aren't solely concerned about opinion and the ones who are are typically the ones who will never be completely satisfied
1556360	1559120	Anyway as you'll never be fully on board with them
1559120	1564480	What matters is respect from the people who are reasonable and a lot of people are reasonable and do care about you boogie
1564480	1569840	There's a lot of people who relate to the struggles that you've been in the past and you're definitely a guiding force to a lot
1569840	1573920	Of people who are experiencing the troubles that you went through a lot of us on the internet have
1574160	1579960	Experienced that pain and anyone will tell you that that pain doesn't just go away and I feel that sometimes you let it be a part
1579960	1585480	Of you when responding to these situations and that you are greater than that making people happy is a good thing
1585500	1587860	But appeasement isn't always the best option
1587860	1593180	I think today's analysis may have outlined a few problems that hopefully can be worked on because I think as an
1593420	1599940	Inspirational figure there is a lot to like but there are also many flaws and that's something that can be worked on boogie recently made
1599940	1605700	A video lamenting that his channel might be dying and I think that may come from the fact that people have sometimes lost faith in
1605700	1610580	The more serious takes and Francis is a dated concept that he can't rely on nowadays
1610580	1617060	He needs to turn something that he can hold on to there will always be drama to react to but it's your reactions that will
1617060	1619060	Shape what kind of audience you retain?
1619840	1626360	Most things are not black and white but instead of leaving it gray you can pick apart the details that may be easier to distinguish
1626360	1633620	That's why I did today saying boogie is offensive or boogie is not offensive isn't particularly constructive because it's not that simple often
1633620	1636040	It depends but if you don't provide the conditions
1636040	1639840	Which it depends on the people can't really take anything away from what you say either
1639840	1644040	I think that's what distinguishes you from being offensive to someone who stands for something
1644040	1648740	You can still believe in it, but have reservations every sensible doctrine should in a way
1648740	1652420	But if you don't state them people just see you as someone trying too hard to appease
1652580	1659900	Individuals and you'll contradict yourself countless times because you only speak in vague language and people will eventually become detached from you as a creator
1659900	1664700	Because a creator who stands for nothing stands for no one anyhow, that's the end of the video
1664700	1666940	I would love to hear what you think about boogie to 988
1666940	1672040	I get a lot of mixed responses from a lot of my friends about what they think of him and therefore it'd be really good
1672040	1676400	To see the audience's verdict. I would also love to thank my fantastic editors
1676400	1680740	They all are budding and coming up and making great content as they are right now
1680740	1682920	And I would definitely employ you to check them out
1682920	1686400	If you have the time this video would not be here if it weren't for them
1686400	1692280	So, please send them some love also if you want to reach me, you can get me on Twitter at the right opinion fairly rudimentary
1692280	1696760	I'll also leave my Facebook link in the description below and my discord link. I will be more active in there
1696760	1701620	I promise I sell every video. I've been a naughty man. We're gonna come back stronger than ever anyhow
1701620	1703780	I don't think I really have too much else to say today apart
1703780	1709380	thank you for all the support as always it really does make a difference for me and I look forward to making these videos and
1709760	1716700	That's something truly special. So for that I thank you and I'm the right opinion and I'll see you in the next one
1726760	1728760	You
