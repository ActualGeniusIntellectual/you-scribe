00:00.000 --> 00:05.760
The home of a twat with too much free time and I thought I'd start off today's video with a story because who doesn't love a

00:05.760 --> 00:09.860
Good story. Anyway, where were we? I went to VidCon this year

00:09.860 --> 00:14.980
I had a great time and met loads of top lads and handsome chaps and if I did have the chance to meet you

00:14.980 --> 00:16.220
I hope I see you again

00:16.220 --> 00:20.660
And if I didn't I will be at conventions in the future hopefully and it would be cool to see you there

00:20.660 --> 00:25.020
I was inside one of these halls at VidCon as the roaming fees are absolutely insane

00:25.020 --> 00:28.940
I had to rely on Wi-Fi and there were only certain places I could attain it

00:29.000 --> 00:31.400
This hall was one of those places, but it was fairly late

00:31.400 --> 00:37.260
The hall was fairly empty and I was messaging people to try and ascertain their location so we could go and chill then I saw

00:37.260 --> 00:39.540
Something the doors opening I turned my attention

00:39.880 --> 00:46.020
Lo and behold there stood Billy the fridge and there sat in his mobility scooter boogie2988

00:46.020 --> 00:49.500
They were stopped by a fan and they told them that they were on their way to a meeting

00:49.500 --> 00:52.020
So I decided against intercepting them myself

00:52.020 --> 00:55.280
I am a courteous gentleman for the very few who are unaware

00:55.380 --> 00:58.940
Boogie2988 is a youtuber known for a range of videos

00:58.940 --> 01:02.660
He has this persona Francis, which is a satirical take on gamers

01:02.660 --> 01:08.540
And then this other set of videos which discusses more deeper and personal topics often and even some drama

01:08.540 --> 01:13.140
So I saw those lads I let them go. I didn't have anything to speak to them about regardless

01:13.140 --> 01:17.380
I mean what could have possibly unfolded over a few days of banter at VidCon?

01:17.380 --> 01:20.280
Well due to my lack of internet in places

01:20.280 --> 01:24.740
I paid less attention to the internet and when I did it was typically at unsociable hours

01:24.740 --> 01:29.880
So when someone asked me what I thought of the boogie situation, my initial response was wait. What?

01:29.920 --> 01:30.420
Yes

01:30.420 --> 01:36.900
Apparently at the time that I saw him a situation was actually at the peak of unfolding one very interesting discussion

01:36.900 --> 01:40.100
Which was to result in an eventual apology from the man in question

01:40.100 --> 01:48.020
I'll explain the basic situation before going into a bit more of a exploration phase the predicament that arose wasn't actually sourced at VidCon

01:48.020 --> 01:53.080
It was sourced briefly before VidCon when boogie made an appearance on the h3 podcast, you know

01:53.080 --> 01:55.720
The podcast hosted by h3. It's in the name

01:55.720 --> 02:00.160
But anyhow, he was on there and they were just shooting the shit and the topic of VidCon

02:00.880 --> 02:04.260
2017 came up an event that I will be covering in more depth later

02:04.260 --> 02:10.360
But to summarize he hosted a panel with video game feminist Anita Sarkeesian and at the end of the panel

02:10.360 --> 02:14.880
He said something that she objected to and this led to a confrontation and subsequent discussion

02:14.880 --> 02:22.300
However, during the discourse about this situation on the h3 podcast boogie said something that people took objection to he made a few comments one

02:22.420 --> 02:25.120
Notoriously about gay marriage that some felt was in poor form

02:25.260 --> 02:31.500
This led to a lot of back and forth between boogie and these critics and eventually led him to retracting his original statement

02:31.500 --> 02:35.700
This inevitably was followed by accusations that boogie was fenced sitting some for the comments

02:35.700 --> 02:39.600
He made and then some for the subsequent retraction. However, this isn't really new

02:39.600 --> 02:46.660
In fact boogie has been in this position times before even the original situation where he made a video on meeting Anita Sarkeesian

02:46.660 --> 02:50.620
He received these same allegations. Unfortunately, you cannot please everyone

02:50.660 --> 02:56.740
However, generally I do believe that people should stand for what they believe in and shouldn't just cater to every side as although these

02:56.740 --> 03:03.100
Things often bank on some sort of subjectivity. There is a societal context that may make a certain choice preferable

03:03.100 --> 03:09.060
So today what I'm going to be doing is my own little personal investigation into whether boogie can be considered a fence-sitter

03:09.560 --> 03:14.260
Initiating with a little exploration discussion and then reapplying it to the situation in question

03:14.260 --> 03:17.500
So we can hopefully come to a bit more of a steadfast conclusion on it

03:17.500 --> 03:23.120
So what I did is I pulled up a selection of boogie videos over the last few years in which he covered drama some more

03:23.180 --> 03:28.820
Contentious than others to try and decipher if he's been employing any tactics that we would be able to pin down to fence-sitting

03:28.940 --> 03:31.980
Handering or anything else. Maybe I was pleasantly surprised

03:31.980 --> 03:38.360
I found to be a man of strong principle just of elaborate reasoning and the proneness to being persuaded or maybe I just found it

03:38.360 --> 03:41.940
A facade for someone who is just trying to please every demographic

03:41.940 --> 03:46.520
I watched a few boogie videos on drama in my time, but generally I do not follow him too closely

03:46.520 --> 03:52.520
So although some of these were revisits most of them were looked at with a fresh eye. So without further ado, let's get to it

04:01.100 --> 04:05.560
So I watched a selection of boogie videos and I have compiled a various range of

04:05.820 --> 04:12.760
Observations and we'll go through them in a sort of chronological order. I started by watching his response to Nicole Arbors dear fat people

04:12.760 --> 04:17.040
I found it an appropriate video to start on as I'd recently covered Nicole Arber myself

04:17.040 --> 04:22.840
So I was wondering what he had to say about her defining classic and generally I think out of the videos

04:22.840 --> 04:27.600
I watched it was the best one and I think it managed to demonstrate what boogie could be at his best

04:27.880 --> 04:33.760
Taking a concrete stance while still being considerate of those that may disagree with him and attempting to appeal to them as well

04:33.760 --> 04:36.040
That's something that I feel is very important

04:36.040 --> 04:41.160
So I do actually think this was a strong video to look at for example saying that obesity shouldn't be indulged

04:41.160 --> 04:42.560
But while still having that

04:42.560 --> 04:50.160
Reservation that there are ways to be constructive about it and help people make that change in a way different to what Nicole Arber thought

04:50.160 --> 04:55.560
Was preferable I followed this by taking a look at his Logan Paul video and he did not necessarily say anything

04:55.560 --> 05:01.080
I disagree within that one as well and he definitely got it out soon enough to avoid the accusation of not bringing anything to the

05:01.320 --> 05:05.840
Conversation however, this is why I outlined one of the defining features of boogies approach to drama

05:05.840 --> 05:09.560
He tends to approach the video assuming that the person has good intentions

05:09.640 --> 05:14.380
But now let me say, um, I do believe his intentions were good because if you look at the end of the video

05:14.380 --> 05:18.680
He includes the suicidal national hotline number the same one. I included down below

05:19.280 --> 05:23.240
He gave out the message that you are not alone that there are people here that will help

05:23.240 --> 05:28.120
I think that's all good stuff Logan. If you do stuff like that, you're gonna have me at your back

05:28.120 --> 05:31.280
I'm gonna be standing up there for you and I'm gonna be very proud of you. That's good stuff

05:31.440 --> 05:36.000
Generally, I think that's a fine idea and it's one that I use regularly as a base for all

05:36.000 --> 05:41.720
We should always approach the situation under the premise of reasonable doubt that we have reason to believe that someone has good

05:41.800 --> 05:44.440
Intentions until there is enough proof to suggest otherwise

05:44.480 --> 05:50.800
However, the problem comes around when you set that burden of proof to heavily this generally makes you to permitting of someone and may cause

05:50.800 --> 05:57.720
You to view them positively even when their actions suggest otherwise and they may continue to take advantage of that case in point the fine

05:57.720 --> 06:05.120
Brother situation I think given the level of evidence their behavior provided it show that their intentions were not entirely pure to say the least

06:05.120 --> 06:11.480
However in boogies video he gave far too much benefit of the doubt to them despite the dangerous levels of corporatism in their idea

06:11.480 --> 06:16.840
it also revealed one of the things that I think is one of the most credible criticisms to be levied against boogie and one that

06:16.840 --> 06:21.960
I would definitely place forward myself instead of saying this is a bad idea. It should be stopped

06:21.960 --> 06:25.360
He said well if it goes well, it'll be great for everyone

06:25.360 --> 06:27.200
and if it doesn't it'll be a

06:27.200 --> 06:33.240
disaster for everyone may turn out to be a good thing and I really hope that it does but the proof of the burden lands on

06:33.400 --> 06:37.640
The fine brothers and they have to get this right because if they don't if they don't

06:37.840 --> 06:42.320
There's gonna be hell to pay for all of us man, and nobody wants to pay this particular bill

06:42.320 --> 06:46.760
And that's why people are mad which is something that can be said about a lot of plans

06:46.760 --> 06:51.920
It represents what I call the whiskey problem. What's right opinion boogie isn't an alcoholic

06:51.920 --> 06:54.560
Yeah, shut up you pleb and give me a moment to explain it

06:54.560 --> 06:58.280
The if I whiskey argument is the ultimate fence sitters logic

06:58.280 --> 07:03.520
It was called that because it was originally attributed to a speech made by a lawmaker on prohibition

07:03.520 --> 07:08.720
I'm not gonna read it out. But there's the transcript if you want to pause it and put it in your cringe compilation

07:08.720 --> 07:13.640
Anyhow, this isn't a far cry from what boogie was alluding to in his fine bros video

07:13.640 --> 07:18.520
And I think this follows through from his assumption. They may have had these plans with the best of intentions

07:18.520 --> 07:24.540
But although there are many possibilities there is only one reality when these plans are put to the test

07:25.180 --> 07:28.940
Fortunately the fine bros pulled the plug on the idea due to the initial backlash

07:28.940 --> 07:35.620
I think that in that situation given the circumstances take a firm stance against it very strongly was the right thing to do

07:35.620 --> 07:41.500
I think waiting to find out how it goes is a bad approach in these situations and the it could go well or badly

07:41.660 --> 07:47.540
Is a cop-out position, especially when the projections appear to say that it could go very badly

07:47.540 --> 07:53.520
It's important to take a stronger stance to make sure this idea is not continued with at least in its current state

07:53.840 --> 07:57.740
Fortunately, everyone else managed to stop the fine bros though. It is food for thought

07:58.040 --> 08:01.820
There are people on these platforms that do not have good intentions

08:01.820 --> 08:04.880
I do not think it is a bad thing giving people chances

08:04.880 --> 08:10.680
But there has to be a line drawn and the problem is if you are too permitting to these people you end up letting them

08:10.680 --> 08:16.960
Get too far and then you end up being walked all over which conveniently takes us to our next point the Anita video

08:16.960 --> 08:22.640
This upload is one of his most disliked videos. This was the original take that provoked the podcast discussion

08:22.680 --> 08:28.200
This definitely outlined another key problem with boogies attitude that a lot of people have picked up on his

08:28.360 --> 08:33.960
Constant focus on pleasing people now. Once again, the concept of this in moderation is perfectly fine

08:34.040 --> 08:36.720
Nothing wrong with being empathetic towards others

08:36.720 --> 08:43.120
However, a lot of people pointed out that he came across as far too much like he was policing himself to the point of over

08:43.400 --> 08:48.340
Sensitivity now the story that boogie told in this instance didn't necessarily come to a bad ending

08:48.340 --> 08:51.700
They had a discussion and it sounded fairly constructive

08:51.900 --> 08:58.300
However, generally I don't think it was the outcome that annoyed people because this is not an outcome that would occur every time

08:58.300 --> 09:03.320
I think it was boogies ethos the irritator some people it creates two problems in my mind

09:03.320 --> 09:06.580
If you show yourself as someone who tries too hard to please other people

09:06.700 --> 09:12.820
Then you leave yourself prone to having people who will make unreasonable demands and when you say no to them

09:12.820 --> 09:16.280
They will become upset and aggravated and you will buckle

09:16.360 --> 09:23.540
Also, if you focus too much on pleasing people it becomes hard to stand for anything in particular because plenty of people disagree on topics

09:23.540 --> 09:30.420
and although there are plenty of reasonable people being afraid to upset the unreasonable ones will often make you overly cautious and may make you

09:30.420 --> 09:32.420
Not really stand for anything

09:35.080 --> 09:40.840
Now this isn't to say that it's good to be the opposite being a big old bellend doesn't necessarily work either

09:40.840 --> 09:46.880
But Anita is a great example of someone who in spite of my many criticisms of her and her attitude

09:46.880 --> 09:52.720
She's not afraid to make them feel uncomfortable and that is one thing that I will stand by we should not always

09:53.000 --> 09:58.320
Focus on making people comfortable. There are definitely standards of conduct, but you can't pander too much either

09:58.600 --> 10:04.000
Sometimes opinions will be said that make others uncomfortable and I think boogie worries too much about that

10:04.000 --> 10:06.880
I watched a lot of boogie videos where he discusses his own

10:07.240 --> 10:13.520
Experiences and his own mental health issues and I think his positions or drama likely arise from the fact that he has been so

10:13.520 --> 10:21.240
Exposed in his earlier life to a torrent of negative abuse that he really wants to avoid that confrontation and I completely understand that

10:21.240 --> 10:23.000
But I think even with that in mind

10:23.000 --> 10:30.000
There are definitely ways you can handle drama in a more opinionated fashion and being able to stop these things while still avoiding the vitriol

10:30.000 --> 10:32.720
Of the online hordes, I mean you're on the internet

10:32.720 --> 10:34.920
You're gonna receive hate regards of where you stand

10:34.920 --> 10:38.800
especially when your boogie sighs and he knows that and I think an important part is how you

10:38.920 --> 10:42.000
Respond to hate and when the hate is a bit higher than normal

10:42.000 --> 10:44.940
It's important not to backtrack just to appease the masses

10:44.940 --> 10:50.280
I want to clarify that I don't think there's an issue with admitting you're wrong sometimes in fact being prepared to admit

10:50.280 --> 10:52.560
You're wrong is an important part of any discourse

10:52.560 --> 10:54.720
However, it's the reasons for admitting you're wrong

10:54.720 --> 11:00.160
If you see someone's logic and you understand that point of view then you may want to change your mind

11:00.200 --> 11:06.780
However boogie often seems to backtrack to appease the number of people who object to him rather than their own logic

11:06.780 --> 11:14.040
He made a video in response to grade-a under a's allegations that Matthew Santoro was plagiarizing his videos now in the video

11:14.040 --> 11:17.760
I can understand how some people may have interpreted it as a defense

11:17.760 --> 11:20.820
But I personally found it quite a decent look at the situation

11:20.820 --> 11:27.120
Although not all of his points were entirely relevant to the discussion that I feel many were trying to have his approach seemed fairly reasoned

11:27.120 --> 11:30.920
However, at the time everyone was very riled up from the situation

11:30.920 --> 11:35.960
Which is quite a common phenomenon and one that I might cover in the future what I'm going to say next

11:35.960 --> 11:42.600
I can't necessarily verify as the video he claimed was unlisted has now been removed entirely and I had to watch a re upload

11:42.600 --> 11:48.680
But he likely received criticism that he was being too soft on Santoro and although he was definitely being very soft

11:48.680 --> 11:50.960
It wasn't anything out of the ordinary to him

11:50.960 --> 11:55.920
So even when presenting his defense he presented the arguments as third person while his conclusion

11:56.280 --> 11:57.800
Actually seemed pretty reasoned

11:57.800 --> 12:02.440
He concluded that Santoro's was probably fair use but he could still see that it incorporated

12:02.700 --> 12:08.360
Plagiaristic elements and that was still shitty and it had no place on his channel and he should definitely be held to account on that

12:08.520 --> 12:10.520
The following day he made a video

12:10.560 --> 12:15.000
Apologizing saying that he screwed up now in hindsight this may have pleased the critics initially

12:15.000 --> 12:18.920
But a lot of the comments now say that he didn't need to make the video and I agree with them

12:19.220 --> 12:25.240
Interpretation is a significant part of your content often how you present it will depend on how other people interpret it

12:25.240 --> 12:31.160
However, there are always people who will interpret it from an exaggerated point of view either against them or against you

12:31.160 --> 12:34.000
That number will increase in reactionary environments

12:34.000 --> 12:40.680
people are provoked by drama and this emotion may affect their reasoning boogie has to pay mind that and avoid being pushed over and

12:40.680 --> 12:47.520
That's the thing boogie often judges himself on the public response that can lead to two problems in dramatic situations where response may be

12:48.040 --> 12:51.960
Disproportionate firstly if you side with the angry crowd in an attempt to gain popular support

12:52.160 --> 12:59.280
Time will transpire and your anger will be shown as overblown and this will undermine your credibility as an arbitrator for the community on the other

12:59.280 --> 13:02.360
Hand if you avoid that and you face immediate backlash

13:02.360 --> 13:08.280
You may have the tendency to buckle and give in to the angry mob which will frame you as someone who's more focused on catering

13:08.280 --> 13:10.760
To opinions rather than having your own generally

13:10.760 --> 13:17.260
I think it's really easy to be caught up in crowd outrage and the community of commentary has been no stranger to that even I

13:17.260 --> 13:20.760
On occasion have done it but long term it pays off to be rational

13:20.760 --> 13:25.440
Which may even include having the unpopular opinion sometimes and that's something that boogie does

13:25.560 --> 13:29.800
Occasionally seem afraid of and that might stem from the fear of receiving negative feedback

13:29.800 --> 13:33.160
But you can't measure your opinions on the like to dislike ratio

13:33.160 --> 13:36.280
Which is also why in spite of the problems with this video on Anita

13:36.280 --> 13:41.960
I actually respect it for staying up in spite of the turbulent public response boogie seems to run a series of

13:42.240 --> 13:46.220
Algorithms that create his opinions. This is something that a lot of us do subconsciously

13:46.300 --> 13:50.740
However, we all lean on different rules different heuristics to help come to those conclusions

13:50.740 --> 13:55.300
No one's thought process is entirely the same which is why we come to different conclusions

13:55.300 --> 14:00.860
I think boogie's algorithms probably lean too much on those around him and their immediate emotional response

14:00.860 --> 14:07.620
Which often leads to heavily mitigated opinions and occasional retractions rather than what may be best long term for people to hear

14:07.620 --> 14:09.060
And I think that's the core issue

14:09.060 --> 14:13.860
One of the greatest concerns might be the boogie always takes up the least offensive opinion

14:13.860 --> 14:20.300
There is an algorithm that just focuses on how many people an opinion might offend and how deeply they are offended

14:20.300 --> 14:25.140
So even in a situation like the Anita one where his video wasn't necessarily popular

14:25.140 --> 14:29.460
Although a lot of people disagree with his point of view none of them really held it against him

14:29.460 --> 14:34.620
Which may be something boogie's paying attention to and although his opinions aren't unreasonable in a way

14:34.620 --> 14:36.620
I think that I and many others like

14:36.980 --> 14:40.660
Justification for one's opinion to be more than just an attempt to please others

14:40.780 --> 14:43.820
You cannot afford to become too reliant on your environments

14:43.820 --> 14:48.960
This leads us to our latest situation one that showcased a lot of these problems and a few new ones

14:54.340 --> 14:57.500
Now before I watched the video I actually checked out the tweets

14:57.900 --> 15:03.660
Insinuating the drama it seems there were two points of interest the point that toxicity on both sides is something that should aim to be

15:03.660 --> 15:06.460
Avoided died down pretty quickly. There was a bit of a backlash

15:06.500 --> 15:11.780
But he dealt with it fairly competently and in all fairness if you were following this drama in real time

15:11.780 --> 15:16.460
Then you might be mistaken to think that it had all died down after the couple days following the video release

15:16.460 --> 15:21.060
He addressed this initial point and it was laid to rest. So what exactly revived it?

15:21.060 --> 15:26.540
Well, eventually he tweeted about it more and more and then he got caught up in his comments about gay marriage

15:26.540 --> 15:30.780
So after VidCon I sat down to watch the clip very conveniently uploaded

15:30.780 --> 15:33.640
So I didn't have to trawl through the whole podcast papa bless

15:33.640 --> 15:39.160
I could have just skipped to the specific comment. However context sake I thought I'd watch the whole thing after all

15:39.160 --> 15:43.860
It wasn't that long and it might provide me with additional information omitted from the tweets

15:43.860 --> 15:48.080
So I sat down and checked it out and the first six minutes passed without incident

15:48.080 --> 15:53.340
He framed himself as a bit firmer than in the video the year before but otherwise it was fairly consistent

15:53.340 --> 15:58.680
And then the sentence that must have lit the fuse was uttered like I always believed. Hey, we should have same-sex marriage

15:58.680 --> 16:02.240
I love same-sex marriage. Let's do it. But the problem is we try to get it done right now

16:02.880 --> 16:04.440
There's gonna be a huge backlash

16:04.440 --> 16:10.460
Okay, so let's let's try to do it in 20 years in 10 years and let's see if we can avoid the backlash, right?

16:10.460 --> 16:12.840
Let's just like slowly methodically change minds

16:12.840 --> 16:16.920
I've always been a big fan of slowly methodically changing minds because I don't like it when gay people get killed

16:16.920 --> 16:22.520
I don't like when somebody gets murdered for being gay. So let's not rile up the fucking crazies. Okay, let's just go slow and easy

16:22.580 --> 16:29.200
Now this immediately struck me as off on the surface. It was just a terrible logical continuation from the previous talking point

16:29.200 --> 16:35.420
He was saying that the way that Anita conduct herself was often too aggressive for many people to empathize with and thus made her cause

16:35.420 --> 16:40.680
Harder to support this is a reasonable point of view when you're trying to convince someone else of your opinion

16:40.800 --> 16:44.760
Anita's technique is seldom the best and has led to a lot of ridicule

16:44.760 --> 16:51.120
But to follow this line of reasoning about gay marriage seems strangely bizarre and let me explain why his point was that he would have

16:51.120 --> 16:57.680
Rather waited for more people to have been convinced that gay marriage was a good idea rather than legalize it immediately to avoid backlash

16:57.800 --> 17:05.380
This implies a follow from argumentative reasonability, but legalization doesn't really fall under that gay marriage carries a lot of weight behind it

17:05.380 --> 17:07.920
But it's more of an outcome rather than a technique

17:07.920 --> 17:12.920
Very few people are going to change their mind about the legalization of something while it's being

17:13.040 --> 17:16.220
Legalized at that point the proof of the pudding is in the eating

17:16.220 --> 17:19.720
It also doesn't help the boogie provided no time frame for his argument

17:19.720 --> 17:25.460
He didn't say whether this waiting of 10 or 20 years was from a position of a few decades ago or from the present day

17:25.460 --> 17:31.260
It was a very confusing example and one that in context does not hold up by doing this

17:31.260 --> 17:35.300
He focused on policy rather than how people argued it and even though

17:35.500 --> 17:40.560
Criticizing someone's delivery is a perfectly reasonable thing to do because it will annihilate people

17:40.560 --> 17:44.580
It doesn't necessarily change the validity of a greater point that might attempt to be made

17:44.580 --> 17:51.300
I do believe that it's smart to call people out to a championing causes in a destructive fashion and have regularly said that a good

17:51.300 --> 17:54.140
Cause does not give you any right to behave like a twat

17:54.140 --> 18:01.580
But an argument still has a stance regardless of who the proponent is which is funny as that was literally something that boogie just acknowledged

18:01.580 --> 18:07.220
But okay in spite of this strange contextual logic. Does the argument have any merit on its own?

18:07.220 --> 18:13.620
So his point was that he'd want to hold off legislation to avoid giving the crazy people ammunition to go crazy

18:13.740 --> 18:18.220
But I personally think that's a poor line of reasoning generally speaking in modern times

18:18.220 --> 18:23.580
There is a sect of the population that will always be a bit nuts and then you have the rest of the public who are

18:23.580 --> 18:28.820
Fairly reasonable individuals. They may be wrong from time to time and they may be more divided on certain issues

18:28.820 --> 18:32.180
But most of them generally are open-minded and ready to hear you out

18:32.420 --> 18:39.820
The thing about legislation is although it's fairly affirmative if that particular legalization doesn't have a huge impact on an individual

18:39.820 --> 18:43.280
They will judge a response on how proportionately appropriate it is

18:43.280 --> 18:49.520
So if the crazies did go crazy in response many people would simply side against them and actually the case for gay marriage would just

18:49.520 --> 18:56.400
Be strengthened. The problem is that when we're discussing gay marriage as boogie knowledge, these nutters are merely looking for ammunition

18:56.400 --> 19:01.280
They're not looking to be convinced the people who are reasonable are those who we should be interested in

19:01.280 --> 19:05.360
The only real concern we should avoid is making the crazy people look reasonable

19:05.360 --> 19:09.280
But I don't think that's something that legislation would do nor is it something that it has done

19:09.280 --> 19:15.400
In fact gay marriage support is an all-time high probably because people realized it didn't have much impact on their lives

19:15.400 --> 19:17.720
If someone is out killing gay people

19:17.720 --> 19:23.440
They may be a tough cookie to convince that gay marriage is worthwhile on top of that given the passivity of the legislation

19:23.760 --> 19:30.320
It's not like education and discourse cannot continue after it. We can still carry on discussing these things

19:30.320 --> 19:35.400
We can still carry on going out and trying to convince people and now we also have the idea that

19:35.640 --> 19:38.680
Actually, it's working out quite well as further proof

19:38.720 --> 19:44.360
one of the things that I personally have found so take this with a grain of salt is that many violent extremists are not

19:44.560 --> 19:49.480
Extremists because they are strongly politically inclined but for other reasons surrounding their personal lives

19:49.480 --> 19:54.840
And at that point what they do is to hijack a political notion that seems most justifiable to them

19:54.840 --> 19:59.560
I think boogie views their intentions as purely political which is a fault from my point of view

19:59.560 --> 20:05.200
Some people have heard all the arguments and are simply just not interested in engaging on your level

20:05.200 --> 20:08.080
There is a difference between violence and action

20:08.080 --> 20:15.600
Which is why many of those who argued against boogie reference a famous Martin Luther King comment King was very avidly against violence

20:15.600 --> 20:20.680
But also wanted action so comments about not engaging on their level made by boogie are not all-encompassing

20:20.920 --> 20:25.400
And should definitely require distinction when he makes them. Otherwise, it doesn't make much sense

20:25.880 --> 20:30.040
Still this was only half the story because although I believe his position was greatly flawed

20:30.040 --> 20:34.880
It was a bit of a throwaway comment that may have required some discussion but not the level that it received

20:34.960 --> 20:36.080
He then made this tweet

20:36.080 --> 20:42.400
Which is a curious one because I think he was still trying to address his initial comments that he'd already dealt with to be honest

20:42.400 --> 20:47.360
But the replies tended to want to lean towards this gay marriage comment the one that was floored

20:47.360 --> 20:50.040
He got wrapped up and he just couldn't stop digging

20:50.040 --> 20:55.360
I thought I'd like to address this point on the side note because I think it's an interesting one why some people on the left

20:55.360 --> 20:59.600
Are considered to be more vitriolic and this generally stems from ideological differences

20:59.600 --> 21:06.080
The left are partly driven by the idea of justice what they view as an inherently moral concept to contrast the right would respond

21:06.080 --> 21:08.920
Well, this is what works and in a way it is justice

21:08.920 --> 21:15.960
Whereas the more judgmental perhaps even arrogant sets of the rights tend to view their detractors as ignorant requiring education

21:15.960 --> 21:23.080
But not necessarily action the more judgmental sets of the left tend to view their detractors as immoral and immoral people can never act in

21:23.080 --> 21:24.080
good faith

21:24.080 --> 21:28.800
Education would not change that and therefore they are undeserving of a public platform

21:28.880 --> 21:34.720
the tweet that said it all off is actually quite a good follow-on from this point because someone does say that gay marriage is a

21:34.720 --> 21:39.080
Moral issue and I've discussed this but you can see why his reply may be ill-advised

21:39.360 --> 21:45.560
What this led to is more and more tweets and then boogie said this which once again is a sign that he's kind of

21:45.760 --> 21:51.500
Fence-sitting because in the space of a tweet he says yes fuck all these people but still let's try and persuade them

21:51.500 --> 21:54.700
Which I feel demonstrates boogies very flip-flop approach

21:54.700 --> 22:00.500
He's cursing these people off while still appealing to persuading them now if a few of these people are open to persuasion

22:00.500 --> 22:03.960
They're probably not going to listen to someone who has just openly said fuck you

22:03.960 --> 22:07.780
Boogie essentially creates a contradiction by trying to satisfy his critic

22:07.780 --> 22:15.180
But in effect just defeats his own original points because unless he's proposing that other people do the educating which would really undermine the principle

22:15.180 --> 22:19.200
Of practicing what you preach. He seems confused in himself what point he's trying to make

22:19.200 --> 22:23.480
I also think boogie attempts to be a diplomat but can also regularly come across as

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
Condescending such as here on top of that one other thing

22:27.000 --> 22:30.360
I've noticed is that he has a habit of appealing to his good actions

22:30.360 --> 22:35.640
Which although may sometimes be in fair context can push the bounds moral appeals are fine

22:35.640 --> 22:39.440
If they are relevant if someone's accusing you of not supporting certain causes

22:39.440 --> 22:42.700
It may be fair to show evidence of supporting those said courses

22:42.700 --> 22:45.300
However, when the moral area becomes a bit more gray

22:45.300 --> 22:51.240
You have to tread carefully to avoid trivializing these good actions as well as the fact that you need to ask yourself

22:51.280 --> 22:58.240
Do you need to promote your moral credentials to respond to someone's points? It's both about necessity and relevance

22:58.240 --> 23:01.800
I just think boogie has too many people to appeal to at points

23:01.800 --> 23:07.720
He calls them an outrage mob which many people would probably not like to say the least and then says I hear you loud and clear

23:07.720 --> 23:13.120
And you can definitely make those two separate points, but without qualification of who and what in these situations

23:13.120 --> 23:17.240
It might just irritate the good actors and give more ammunition to the bad actors

23:17.240 --> 23:22.520
Something that you said you wouldn't want to do and then you make this comment which in effect seems harmless

23:22.520 --> 23:26.600
But I'm a cynic and it's hard not to see it as an attack on an extremely small

23:26.680 --> 23:30.800
Minority of people to try and gain kudos with people that may have been pissed off with you

23:30.800 --> 23:36.880
I seldom saw anyone actually say this to him throughout the situation and this all seems particularly calculated

23:37.000 --> 23:42.520
After a few days of back and forth he just retracted and apologized but it sort of came off as a can you lay off

23:42.520 --> 23:44.520
Please rather than actual apology

23:44.560 --> 23:49.640
He kind of shimmied himself into a damned if you do damned if you don't situation that if he retracted

23:49.640 --> 23:55.400
He'd seem like he's giving in to people and if he doubled down he might be going against the reasoning some people presented him

23:55.400 --> 23:57.800
So I don't want to give him too much more stick for this

23:57.800 --> 24:01.320
But I wish he'd focus more on himself when making these statements

24:07.900 --> 24:12.320
When boogie does something it can often come across with other people in mind

24:12.320 --> 24:19.760
He always manages to include others. And although sometimes it might be justified. It often sounds like he's devolving responsibility

24:19.760 --> 24:22.400
It just means it becomes hard for him to stand for anything

24:22.400 --> 24:30.060
I think in these situations when you focus on so many different people it becomes so easy to contradict yourself that you undermine your own

24:30.320 --> 24:32.660
Credibility buoy clearly wants to be reasonable

24:32.660 --> 24:37.340
but reasons should be an equally internal process rather than relying solely on the

24:37.640 --> 24:44.680
Reaction of those around you as it means that those around you can manipulate their reaction to possibly influence you when you're a public figure

24:44.680 --> 24:46.680
There may be people who can call that out

24:46.920 --> 24:51.480
however, too many people don't have that opportunity and I hear boogie's stories of

24:52.000 --> 24:55.440
Exploitation and manipulation and it does pull on your heartstrings yet

24:55.440 --> 25:00.080
I feel his public status is equally a blessing and a curse with one side

25:00.200 --> 25:04.420
Protecting him from that manipulation happening again with the other exposing him for that

25:04.800 --> 25:09.960
Vulnerability and you can't just allow your environment to shape you that easily because in the wrong situation

25:09.960 --> 25:15.800
It makes you prone to being complicit to some very bad things. I think that's what concerns people fortunately for boogie

25:15.800 --> 25:21.200
I think the weight of those around him is so evenly spread that it won't ever lead to anything particularly damaging

25:21.200 --> 25:26.360
But I think it's important to keep in mind. We can always do better. We can always challenge our audience

25:26.360 --> 25:30.560
So why shouldn't we I've had the same problem as boogie in the past particularly in video form

25:30.580 --> 25:34.380
And what I found was that I had trouble coming to conclusions due to the amount of

25:34.740 --> 25:39.460
Influential conditions and it's easy for things to be taken out of context and used against you

25:39.460 --> 25:44.260
So it is important to qualify your statements to be clear to make sure people understand you

25:44.260 --> 25:50.220
You can still gain respect from a majority of people and actually taking a harder stance against these bad things that may be happening

25:50.380 --> 25:56.020
People aren't solely concerned about opinion and the ones who are are typically the ones who will never be completely satisfied

25:56.360 --> 25:59.120
Anyway as you'll never be fully on board with them

25:59.120 --> 26:04.480
What matters is respect from the people who are reasonable and a lot of people are reasonable and do care about you boogie

26:04.480 --> 26:09.840
There's a lot of people who relate to the struggles that you've been in the past and you're definitely a guiding force to a lot

26:09.840 --> 26:13.920
Of people who are experiencing the troubles that you went through a lot of us on the internet have

26:14.160 --> 26:19.960
Experienced that pain and anyone will tell you that that pain doesn't just go away and I feel that sometimes you let it be a part

26:19.960 --> 26:25.480
Of you when responding to these situations and that you are greater than that making people happy is a good thing

26:25.500 --> 26:27.860
But appeasement isn't always the best option

26:27.860 --> 26:33.180
I think today's analysis may have outlined a few problems that hopefully can be worked on because I think as an

26:33.420 --> 26:39.940
Inspirational figure there is a lot to like but there are also many flaws and that's something that can be worked on boogie recently made

26:39.940 --> 26:45.700
A video lamenting that his channel might be dying and I think that may come from the fact that people have sometimes lost faith in

26:45.700 --> 26:50.580
The more serious takes and Francis is a dated concept that he can't rely on nowadays

26:50.580 --> 26:57.060
He needs to turn something that he can hold on to there will always be drama to react to but it's your reactions that will

26:57.060 --> 26:59.060
Shape what kind of audience you retain?

26:59.840 --> 27:06.360
Most things are not black and white but instead of leaving it gray you can pick apart the details that may be easier to distinguish

27:06.360 --> 27:13.620
That's why I did today saying boogie is offensive or boogie is not offensive isn't particularly constructive because it's not that simple often

27:13.620 --> 27:16.040
It depends but if you don't provide the conditions

27:16.040 --> 27:19.840
Which it depends on the people can't really take anything away from what you say either

27:19.840 --> 27:24.040
I think that's what distinguishes you from being offensive to someone who stands for something

27:24.040 --> 27:28.740
You can still believe in it, but have reservations every sensible doctrine should in a way

27:28.740 --> 27:32.420
But if you don't state them people just see you as someone trying too hard to appease

27:32.580 --> 27:39.900
Individuals and you'll contradict yourself countless times because you only speak in vague language and people will eventually become detached from you as a creator

27:39.900 --> 27:44.700
Because a creator who stands for nothing stands for no one anyhow, that's the end of the video

27:44.700 --> 27:46.940
I would love to hear what you think about boogie to 988

27:46.940 --> 27:52.040
I get a lot of mixed responses from a lot of my friends about what they think of him and therefore it'd be really good

27:52.040 --> 27:56.400
To see the audience's verdict. I would also love to thank my fantastic editors

27:56.400 --> 28:00.740
They all are budding and coming up and making great content as they are right now

28:00.740 --> 28:02.920
And I would definitely employ you to check them out

28:02.920 --> 28:06.400
If you have the time this video would not be here if it weren't for them

28:06.400 --> 28:12.280
So, please send them some love also if you want to reach me, you can get me on Twitter at the right opinion fairly rudimentary

28:12.280 --> 28:16.760
I'll also leave my Facebook link in the description below and my discord link. I will be more active in there

28:16.760 --> 28:21.620
I promise I sell every video. I've been a naughty man. We're gonna come back stronger than ever anyhow

28:21.620 --> 28:23.780
I don't think I really have too much else to say today apart

28:23.780 --> 28:29.380
thank you for all the support as always it really does make a difference for me and I look forward to making these videos and

28:29.760 --> 28:36.700
That's something truly special. So for that I thank you and I'm the right opinion and I'll see you in the next one

28:46.760 --> 28:48.760
You
