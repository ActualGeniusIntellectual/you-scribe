00:00.000 --> 00:06.180
Do you ever have funny feelings with a person that someone's personality is just a bit off?

00:06.880 --> 00:08.880
I have those feelings with Hillary Clinton.

00:17.800 --> 00:24.020
Hello, I'm the right opinion and today we talk about yes, you know what the Clinton

00:30.000 --> 00:36.380
Now let's get some background on this in 2008 Hillary ran against the political behemoth that was Barack Obama and lost

00:36.720 --> 00:40.880
Despite winning the popular vote Clinton lost on the number of contests and delegates

00:40.880 --> 00:45.180
So she lost overall the great electoral college working its magic again

00:45.180 --> 00:51.920
now that was probably better for the Democrats in hindsight as Obama went on to win the presidential race convincingly against John McCain and

00:52.360 --> 00:56.160
Subsequently hold that position for another term after defeating Mitt Romney

00:56.760 --> 01:02.480
Hillary was back though like an annoying Veruca on your left toe. She wouldn't go away bazooka that Veruca in

01:03.120 --> 01:10.640
2015 she relaunched her campaign for the Democratic nomination running on her so-called platform of extreme liberalism that she often likes to project

01:11.400 --> 01:13.720
But something just didn't feel quite right

01:14.480 --> 01:18.200
Well, not for me at least. I think a good place to start is our attitude

01:18.200 --> 01:20.200
I'm

01:22.120 --> 01:24.120
Just chillin in Cedar Rapids

01:25.640 --> 01:31.640
Now in case you haven't seen that video that is Clinton trying to get down with the kids and it's not the first time she's

01:31.640 --> 01:34.680
Trying to do it. She's done some very cringe-worthy moves on Ellen DeGeneres

01:35.920 --> 01:41.520
And some other skin-crawling statements have been rightfully parodied by many youtubers in my bag

01:48.200 --> 01:50.200
And

01:53.680 --> 01:57.760
Some people may say well, you know at least she's trying

01:58.640 --> 02:00.740
There's something so out of touch about it

02:00.740 --> 02:03.840
And if she is too disconnected to understand how to appeal to them

02:03.920 --> 02:07.560
How should people be able to trust her to understand their problems?

02:08.600 --> 02:10.880
Another problem I have is her tendency to switch political

02:11.280 --> 02:13.720
Standpoints and I'm not doubting this can be a good thing

02:13.760 --> 02:18.080
It can often demonstrate an open-minded progressiveness to evolve as a person

02:18.080 --> 02:23.560
However, Hillary Clinton has been exploiting that a bit too much for my liking. Here's a few examples in

02:24.080 --> 02:31.400
2003 she opposed same-sex marriage in 2004. She favored 2014. She favored deporting children coming from Central America in

02:32.120 --> 02:36.880
2015 she opposed it in 2000. She opposed lifting the trade embargo on Cuba in

02:37.560 --> 02:39.560
2014 she favored it and

02:39.840 --> 02:44.960
They're just a few examples and I'm not doubting she has had very volatile opinions a lot of people have

02:45.640 --> 02:50.480
But at one point she was a Republican working for Barry Goldwater a candidate so far

02:50.480 --> 02:53.180
Right. He opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act

02:53.520 --> 02:59.320
The problem with regards to this is that when you fluctuate your opinion so radically you risk sacrificing credibility

02:59.520 --> 03:01.480
Whether it's with public opinion or not

03:01.480 --> 03:04.560
How are people going to trust you to not change your mind once you're elected?

03:04.560 --> 03:07.560
It also means that people start to question your principles

03:07.560 --> 03:11.600
How many of these policies you genuinely believe in and how many of them you are just

03:11.840 --> 03:17.720
Reiterating to massage that popular vote. My final problem is that she is so so damn establishment

03:17.720 --> 03:24.120
She made more in one speech than Bernie Sanders did in a whole fiscal year and I'm not criticizing her for being successful

03:24.120 --> 03:26.240
I think we'd all take that money if we could

03:26.760 --> 03:29.360
But her donors her rhetoric her campaign

03:29.360 --> 03:34.520
It's exactly what a load of middle-aged men in suits sat around a table in NYC would come up with

03:34.560 --> 03:38.120
It's all about how much she cares about the problems you're facing without any

03:38.520 --> 03:43.060
specification on what these issues are in the era when people are really beginning to question how

03:43.400 --> 03:50.560
Democratic American democracy actually is people question how free Hillary is when she's being funded by so many corporations

03:50.560 --> 03:54.400
They wonder how much control Clinton would have to enact the policies

03:54.400 --> 03:59.120
The people want rather than what the companies want and this is why Sanders is doing so well

03:59.320 --> 04:01.960
Because he's not under the finger of corporate control

04:01.960 --> 04:06.580
I've a lot of arguments about how it'd be great for America to have their first female president

04:06.580 --> 04:10.800
And yeah, it would be cool and progressive and radical even Oh

04:11.160 --> 04:18.040
How about we prioritize having a good president regardless of any extensible features? So what are your thoughts?

04:18.760 --> 04:24.280
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe Hillary Clinton is the best thing to happen to the u.s. Since

04:25.320 --> 04:27.320
Bill Clinton. Oh

04:27.320 --> 04:33.520
Yeah, I almost didn't mention him at all anyway on that note I'm the right pinion and I'm out
