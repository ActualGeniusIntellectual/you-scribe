1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,180
Do you ever have funny feelings with a person that someone's personality is just a bit off?

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,880
I have those feelings with Hillary Clinton.

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:24,020
Hello, I'm the right opinion and today we talk about yes, you know what the Clinton

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,380
Now let's get some background on this in 2008 Hillary ran against the political behemoth that was Barack Obama and lost

5
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,880
Despite winning the popular vote Clinton lost on the number of contests and delegates

6
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,180
So she lost overall the great electoral college working its magic again

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,920
now that was probably better for the Democrats in hindsight as Obama went on to win the presidential race convincingly against John McCain and

8
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,160
Subsequently hold that position for another term after defeating Mitt Romney

9
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,480
Hillary was back though like an annoying Veruca on your left toe. She wouldn't go away bazooka that Veruca in

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,640
2015 she relaunched her campaign for the Democratic nomination running on her so-called platform of extreme liberalism that she often likes to project

11
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,720
But something just didn't feel quite right

12
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,200
Well, not for me at least. I think a good place to start is our attitude

13
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,200
I'm

14
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,120
Just chillin in Cedar Rapids

15
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Now in case you haven't seen that video that is Clinton trying to get down with the kids and it's not the first time she's

16
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,680
Trying to do it. She's done some very cringe-worthy moves on Ellen DeGeneres

17
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,520
And some other skin-crawling statements have been rightfully parodied by many youtubers in my bag

18
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,200
And

19
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,760
Some people may say well, you know at least she's trying

20
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,740
There's something so out of touch about it

21
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,840
And if she is too disconnected to understand how to appeal to them

22
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,560
How should people be able to trust her to understand their problems?

23
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,880
Another problem I have is her tendency to switch political

24
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,720
Standpoints and I'm not doubting this can be a good thing

25
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,080
It can often demonstrate an open-minded progressiveness to evolve as a person

26
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,560
However, Hillary Clinton has been exploiting that a bit too much for my liking. Here's a few examples in

27
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,400
2003 she opposed same-sex marriage in 2004. She favored 2014. She favored deporting children coming from Central America in

28
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,880
2015 she opposed it in 2000. She opposed lifting the trade embargo on Cuba in

29
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,560
2014 she favored it and

30
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,960
They're just a few examples and I'm not doubting she has had very volatile opinions a lot of people have

31
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,480
But at one point she was a Republican working for Barry Goldwater a candidate so far

32
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,180
Right. He opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act

33
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,320
The problem with regards to this is that when you fluctuate your opinion so radically you risk sacrificing credibility

34
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,480
Whether it's with public opinion or not

35
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,560
How are people going to trust you to not change your mind once you're elected?

36
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,560
It also means that people start to question your principles

37
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,600
How many of these policies you genuinely believe in and how many of them you are just

38
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,720
Reiterating to massage that popular vote. My final problem is that she is so so damn establishment

39
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:24,120
She made more in one speech than Bernie Sanders did in a whole fiscal year and I'm not criticizing her for being successful

40
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,240
I think we'd all take that money if we could

41
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,360
But her donors her rhetoric her campaign

42
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,520
It's exactly what a load of middle-aged men in suits sat around a table in NYC would come up with

43
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,120
It's all about how much she cares about the problems you're facing without any

44
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,060
specification on what these issues are in the era when people are really beginning to question how

45
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:50,560
Democratic American democracy actually is people question how free Hillary is when she's being funded by so many corporations

46
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,400
They wonder how much control Clinton would have to enact the policies

47
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,120
The people want rather than what the companies want and this is why Sanders is doing so well

48
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,960
Because he's not under the finger of corporate control

49
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,580
I've a lot of arguments about how it'd be great for America to have their first female president

50
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,800
And yeah, it would be cool and progressive and radical even Oh

51
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:18,040
How about we prioritize having a good president regardless of any extensible features? So what are your thoughts?

52
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:24,280
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe Hillary Clinton is the best thing to happen to the u.s. Since

53
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,320
Bill Clinton. Oh

54
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,520
Yeah, I almost didn't mention him at all anyway on that note I'm the right pinion and I'm out
