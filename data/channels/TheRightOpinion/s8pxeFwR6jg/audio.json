{"text": " Do you ever have funny feelings with a person that someone's personality is just a bit off? I have those feelings with Hillary Clinton. Hello, I'm the right opinion and today we talk about yes, you know what the Clinton Now let's get some background on this in 2008 Hillary ran against the political behemoth that was Barack Obama and lost Despite winning the popular vote Clinton lost on the number of contests and delegates So she lost overall the great electoral college working its magic again now that was probably better for the Democrats in hindsight as Obama went on to win the presidential race convincingly against John McCain and Subsequently hold that position for another term after defeating Mitt Romney Hillary was back though like an annoying Veruca on your left toe. She wouldn't go away bazooka that Veruca in 2015 she relaunched her campaign for the Democratic nomination running on her so-called platform of extreme liberalism that she often likes to project But something just didn't feel quite right Well, not for me at least. I think a good place to start is our attitude I'm Just chillin in Cedar Rapids Now in case you haven't seen that video that is Clinton trying to get down with the kids and it's not the first time she's Trying to do it. She's done some very cringe-worthy moves on Ellen DeGeneres And some other skin-crawling statements have been rightfully parodied by many youtubers in my bag And Some people may say well, you know at least she's trying There's something so out of touch about it And if she is too disconnected to understand how to appeal to them How should people be able to trust her to understand their problems? Another problem I have is her tendency to switch political Standpoints and I'm not doubting this can be a good thing It can often demonstrate an open-minded progressiveness to evolve as a person However, Hillary Clinton has been exploiting that a bit too much for my liking. Here's a few examples in 2003 she opposed same-sex marriage in 2004. She favored 2014. She favored deporting children coming from Central America in 2015 she opposed it in 2000. She opposed lifting the trade embargo on Cuba in 2014 she favored it and They're just a few examples and I'm not doubting she has had very volatile opinions a lot of people have But at one point she was a Republican working for Barry Goldwater a candidate so far Right. He opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act The problem with regards to this is that when you fluctuate your opinion so radically you risk sacrificing credibility Whether it's with public opinion or not How are people going to trust you to not change your mind once you're elected? It also means that people start to question your principles How many of these policies you genuinely believe in and how many of them you are just Reiterating to massage that popular vote. My final problem is that she is so so damn establishment She made more in one speech than Bernie Sanders did in a whole fiscal year and I'm not criticizing her for being successful I think we'd all take that money if we could But her donors her rhetoric her campaign It's exactly what a load of middle-aged men in suits sat around a table in NYC would come up with It's all about how much she cares about the problems you're facing without any specification on what these issues are in the era when people are really beginning to question how Democratic American democracy actually is people question how free Hillary is when she's being funded by so many corporations They wonder how much control Clinton would have to enact the policies The people want rather than what the companies want and this is why Sanders is doing so well Because he's not under the finger of corporate control I've a lot of arguments about how it'd be great for America to have their first female president And yeah, it would be cool and progressive and radical even Oh How about we prioritize having a good president regardless of any extensible features? So what are your thoughts? Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe Hillary Clinton is the best thing to happen to the u.s. Since Bill Clinton. Oh Yeah, I almost didn't mention him at all anyway on that note I'm the right pinion and I'm out", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 6.18, "text": " Do you ever have funny feelings with a person that someone's personality is just a bit off?", "tokens": [50363, 2141, 345, 1683, 423, 8258, 7666, 351, 257, 1048, 326, 2130, 338, 8806, 318, 655, 257, 1643, 572, 30, 50672], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.2830625749983878, "compression_ratio": 1.4313725490196079, "no_speech_prob": 0.003866960760205984}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 6.88, "end": 8.88, "text": " I have those feelings with Hillary Clinton.", "tokens": [50707, 314, 423, 883, 7666, 351, 5073, 2605, 13, 50807], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.2830625749983878, "compression_ratio": 1.4313725490196079, "no_speech_prob": 0.003866960760205984}, {"id": 2, "seek": 0, "start": 17.8, "end": 24.02, "text": " Hello, I'm the right opinion and today we talk about yes, you know what the Clinton", "tokens": [51253, 18435, 11, 314, 1101, 262, 826, 4459, 290, 1909, 356, 1561, 546, 3763, 11, 345, 760, 644, 262, 2605, 51564], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.2830625749983878, "compression_ratio": 1.4313725490196079, "no_speech_prob": 0.003866960760205984}, {"id": 3, "seek": 3000, "start": 30.0, "end": 36.38, "text": " Now let's get some background on this in 2008 Hillary ran against the political behemoth that was Barack Obama and lost", "tokens": [50363, 2735, 1309, 338, 651, 617, 4469, 319, 428, 287, 3648, 5073, 4966, 1028, 262, 1964, 307, 34394, 326, 373, 8732, 2486, 290, 2626, 50682], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.19432616720394214, "compression_ratio": 1.6295081967213114, "no_speech_prob": 0.025012409314513206}, {"id": 4, "seek": 3000, "start": 36.72, "end": 40.88, "text": " Despite winning the popular vote Clinton lost on the number of contests and delegates", "tokens": [50699, 7945, 5442, 262, 2968, 3015, 2605, 2626, 319, 262, 1271, 286, 22830, 290, 15265, 50907], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.19432616720394214, "compression_ratio": 1.6295081967213114, "no_speech_prob": 0.025012409314513206}, {"id": 5, "seek": 3000, "start": 40.88, "end": 45.18, "text": " So she lost overall the great electoral college working its magic again", "tokens": [50907, 1406, 673, 2626, 4045, 262, 1049, 13901, 4152, 1762, 663, 5536, 757, 51122], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.19432616720394214, "compression_ratio": 1.6295081967213114, "no_speech_prob": 0.025012409314513206}, {"id": 6, "seek": 3000, "start": 45.18, "end": 51.92, "text": " now that was probably better for the Democrats in hindsight as Obama went on to win the presidential race convincingly against John McCain and", "tokens": [51122, 783, 326, 373, 2192, 1365, 329, 262, 4956, 287, 36412, 355, 2486, 1816, 319, 284, 1592, 262, 4787, 3234, 15609, 4420, 1028, 1757, 14264, 290, 51459], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.19432616720394214, "compression_ratio": 1.6295081967213114, "no_speech_prob": 0.025012409314513206}, {"id": 7, "seek": 3000, "start": 52.36, "end": 56.16, "text": " Subsequently hold that position for another term after defeating Mitt Romney", "tokens": [51481, 3834, 20415, 1745, 326, 2292, 329, 1194, 3381, 706, 21320, 16627, 8431, 51671], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.19432616720394214, "compression_ratio": 1.6295081967213114, "no_speech_prob": 0.025012409314513206}, {"id": 8, "seek": 5616, "start": 56.76, "end": 62.48, "text": " Hillary was back though like an annoying Veruca on your left toe.
