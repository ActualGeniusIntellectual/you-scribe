0	6180	Do you ever have funny feelings with a person that someone's personality is just a bit off?
6880	8880	I have those feelings with Hillary Clinton.
17800	24020	Hello, I'm the right opinion and today we talk about yes, you know what the Clinton
30000	36380	Now let's get some background on this in 2008 Hillary ran against the political behemoth that was Barack Obama and lost
36720	40880	Despite winning the popular vote Clinton lost on the number of contests and delegates
40880	45180	So she lost overall the great electoral college working its magic again
45180	51920	now that was probably better for the Democrats in hindsight as Obama went on to win the presidential race convincingly against John McCain and
52360	56160	Subsequently hold that position for another term after defeating Mitt Romney
56760	62480	Hillary was back though like an annoying Veruca on your left toe. She wouldn't go away bazooka that Veruca in
63120	70640	2015 she relaunched her campaign for the Democratic nomination running on her so-called platform of extreme liberalism that she often likes to project
71400	73720	But something just didn't feel quite right
74480	78200	Well, not for me at least. I think a good place to start is our attitude
78200	80200	I'm
82120	84120	Just chillin in Cedar Rapids
85640	91640	Now in case you haven't seen that video that is Clinton trying to get down with the kids and it's not the first time she's
91640	94680	Trying to do it. She's done some very cringe-worthy moves on Ellen DeGeneres
95920	101520	And some other skin-crawling statements have been rightfully parodied by many youtubers in my bag
108200	110200	And
113680	117760	Some people may say well, you know at least she's trying
118640	120740	There's something so out of touch about it
120740	123840	And if she is too disconnected to understand how to appeal to them
123920	127560	How should people be able to trust her to understand their problems?
128600	130880	Another problem I have is her tendency to switch political
131280	133720	Standpoints and I'm not doubting this can be a good thing
133760	138080	It can often demonstrate an open-minded progressiveness to evolve as a person
138080	143560	However, Hillary Clinton has been exploiting that a bit too much for my liking. Here's a few examples in
144080	151400	2003 she opposed same-sex marriage in 2004. She favored 2014. She favored deporting children coming from Central America in
152120	156880	2015 she opposed it in 2000. She opposed lifting the trade embargo on Cuba in
157560	159560	2014 she favored it and
159840	164960	They're just a few examples and I'm not doubting she has had very volatile opinions a lot of people have
165640	170480	But at one point she was a Republican working for Barry Goldwater a candidate so far
170480	173180	Right. He opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act
173520	179320	The problem with regards to this is that when you fluctuate your opinion so radically you risk sacrificing credibility
179520	181480	Whether it's with public opinion or not
181480	184560	How are people going to trust you to not change your mind once you're elected?
184560	187560	It also means that people start to question your principles
187560	191600	How many of these policies you genuinely believe in and how many of them you are just
191840	197720	Reiterating to massage that popular vote. My final problem is that she is so so damn establishment
197720	204120	She made more in one speech than Bernie Sanders did in a whole fiscal year and I'm not criticizing her for being successful
204120	206240	I think we'd all take that money if we could
206760	209360	But her donors her rhetoric her campaign
209360	214520	It's exactly what a load of middle-aged men in suits sat around a table in NYC would come up with
214560	218120	It's all about how much she cares about the problems you're facing without any
218520	223060	specification on what these issues are in the era when people are really beginning to question how
223400	230560	Democratic American democracy actually is people question how free Hillary is when she's being funded by so many corporations
230560	234400	They wonder how much control Clinton would have to enact the policies
234400	239120	The people want rather than what the companies want and this is why Sanders is doing so well
239320	241960	Because he's not under the finger of corporate control
241960	246580	I've a lot of arguments about how it'd be great for America to have their first female president
246580	250800	And yeah, it would be cool and progressive and radical even Oh
251160	258040	How about we prioritize having a good president regardless of any extensible features? So what are your thoughts?
258760	264280	Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe Hillary Clinton is the best thing to happen to the u.s. Since
265320	267320	Bill Clinton. Oh
267320	273520	Yeah, I almost didn't mention him at all anyway on that note I'm the right pinion and I'm out
