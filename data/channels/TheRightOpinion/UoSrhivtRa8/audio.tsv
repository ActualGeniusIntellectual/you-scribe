0	2640	A necessary question, for a necessary time.
23600	27600	Ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, and Andrew Finch.
27600	28560	Who is he?
28560	32880	Andrew Finch was the man who was shot dead by police on the night of the 28th December,
32880	37040	responding to a false call in which the SWAT team were deployed. He was 28.
37040	40000	He lived in Wichita, Kansas, and he had two children.
40000	44320	What had provoked this call was a bunch of kids pissing over a Call of Duty game.
44320	47920	One of the team threatened to swat the other, the other said go on, and they did.
47920	50960	However, the individual who encouraged themselves to be swatted provided the
50960	54160	swatters with a false address, which is also not surprising.
54160	57520	In fact, if anything, I'm surprised that the people who caught the police were genuinely
57520	60800	thick enough to think that someone would provide a legitimate address.
60800	64800	But anyway, the team passed their information to the known swatter, Tyler Barris.
64800	67440	As there are ways to conceal your identity in the case of swatting,
67440	70000	they probably thought that by handing it over to someone a bit more discreet,
70000	71600	they would outsmart this other team.
71600	73680	But honestly, it's just beyond stupid.
73680	77280	To make sure the SWAT team turned up, Barris, who also went by the Twitter account,
77280	81920	Swatistic, made the interaction as dramatic as possible, claimed that he had shot his father
81920	85280	in the head, and that he was holding his mother and brother hostage in the closet,
85280	87360	all while having poured gasoline over the house.
115280	124880	Obviously, this wasn't the case, the police arrived, and they apprehended Mr. Finn,
124880	128000	and according to reports, when he didn't fully comply with the police requests,
128000	132320	one officer shot him, and he was pronounced dead following transportation to the local hospital.
132320	135920	Swatting is not new, but this story sticks out because of its tragic outcome.
135920	140960	One innocent man killed because a bunch of kids were salty over a game with a $1.50 wager.
140960	145360	With severe outcomes come severe consequences, and as soon as the outcomes were learned,
145360	148000	every individual involved was looking to point the finger,
148000	151440	the SWAT of the game as law enforcement scrambling for justification,
151440	153840	or information that could lead to a clearer picture.
153840	157040	But things are never that simple, who is to blame?
157040	159920	There's a song called Who Killed Russell Jones by Dolan V,
159920	163440	a spoken word piece where he discusses the people who could have contributed
163440	167680	to the premature demise of old Dirty Bastard from a first-person perspective,
167680	171120	defending their actions as merely participating in the culture.
171120	174080	I want you to hold this thought while we take a trip into the
174080	176320	current culture that preceded this tragedy.
176320	179120	Swatting is not a rare event, it has been a thing for years now,
179120	183360	as Keemstar himself said, the first time he was ever swatted was in 2010,
183360	185600	and he was hardly a big fish back then.
185600	189040	Plenty of famous streamers and gamers have been the victims of swatting,
189040	192800	and in fact, many would argue that it's a risk you now have to anticipate
192800	194880	if you want to participate in the industry.
194880	198080	Once again, a majority of people realise it's a scummy thing to do,
198080	201600	but think, well, it doesn't have any particular long-term consequences,
201600	205440	it's a dick thing to do, but they're probably just dicks anyway, so let's do it.
205440	209920	The gamers were just passionate and passionate people who do stupid things, it was a one-off.
209920	212480	They couldn't anticipate the extreme nature of the swat call,
212480	214240	nor could they have thought in their wildest dreams
214240	216240	that it would lead to someone being shot and killed.
216240	218240	They were naive, but not murderers.
218240	220560	Then you have the swat of Tyler Barris who made the call,
220560	222480	some say that the call was particularly awful,
222480	224960	but I highly doubt it was anything exceptional for Barris,
224960	228880	who puts in an Oscar-worthy performance of a psychotic child in a man's body,
228880	230320	prompting the release of The Unit.
230320	233920	Once again, he basically said he was involved, but not solely accountable.
233920	235920	How could he anticipate such consequences?
235920	238640	He's been doing it forever, and nothing ever happened.
238640	240640	In his Twitter, he claimed he didn't kill anyone
240640	243200	because he wasn't the one who pulled the trigger.
243200	245840	Un-fucking-believable.
245840	248000	So who was the person who pulled the trigger?
248000	250640	Well, the swat officer, who is currently on paid leave.
250640	251520	From what we understand,
251520	254640	when Andrew Finch the father didn't raise both hands in accordance,
254640	256800	this officer in question misinterpreted this
256800	259120	as a reach for the weapons and shot Mr Finch.
259120	262480	Now it's important to remember that just because one wrong has been committed
262480	264960	doesn't mean that the officer is completely vindicated.
264960	268640	He could have still acted rationally or against how they are coordinated too,
268640	271120	and although the call made by Barris was definitely severe,
271120	275520	they always have an obligation to not let their conduct be affected by such factors.
275520	279120	As the officers are always permitted to shoot with reasonable proof of threat,
279200	281680	they'll have to carry out a separate investigation,
281680	284080	and I hope it will be done thoroughly and honestly,
284080	287360	in spite of the fact that my faith in authority is always fairly low.
287360	289360	But obviously the officer wouldn't have been there
289360	292320	if there hadn't been a hoax SWAT call put in in the first place,
292320	294720	which was ridiculously exaggerated.
294720	297920	Officers are not expected to let circumstances influence them,
297920	301440	but they are human beings, and it sometimes happens.
301440	303280	We live in a world of probabilities,
303280	307120	99.9% of SWAT calls may not end in casualties,
307120	310240	but for each factor that plays in the illegitimate SWAT call,
310240	312160	the false address, the itchy trigger finger,
312160	314560	the victim who doesn't quite cooperate with the request,
314560	317920	one time these will all align and something goes wrong.
317920	321520	You have a group of heavily armed individuals responding to a call
321520	323840	about someone who is believed to be extremely dangerous.
323840	325920	It's an outcome that has to be acknowledged,
325920	328160	and every now and then it will be realized.
328160	329840	SWAT teams are very professional,
329840	333680	and once again that officer's conduct will be judged on an independent basis,
333680	336960	but the fact that they're very professional and don't often kill civilians
336960	339040	doesn't give you any right to do it.
339040	341360	And if you say, well most things entail risks,
341360	343040	that shouldn't deter people from doing them,
343040	345520	you miss the point, it's a cost-benefit analysis,
345520	349760	and there is no benefit other than shits and giggles for juvenile man-children.
349760	351600	It wastes police time, resources,
351600	354880	and causes unnecessary emotional stress for many, many people,
354880	357280	and I hope you understand those consequences now.
357280	358480	For those who made it this far,
358480	360960	I want to call back on the story of B. Dolan,
360960	362800	of who killed Russell Jones.
362800	366400	On the pragmatic basis, it was drugs, cocaine, and tramadol,
366400	368480	but as Dolan eloquently unravels,
368480	370800	what really killed him was the toxic culture
370800	375200	that had leaned towards glorifying destructive behavior for vacuous fulfillment.
375200	378480	For Andrew Finch, from the stands, it was a bullet that killed him,
378480	380240	but what really killed him was a plague
380240	383200	that should have been stamped out while many had the chance to.
383200	387200	For you and I, and many gamers, the idea of SWATing is deeply troubling,
387200	389280	but there are clearly some people who believe that,
389280	390640	because they're not the SWAT team,
390640	392400	because they're not the ones holding the weapons,
392480	394640	they cannot be responsible for the consequences
394640	396800	that befall many innocent citizens.
396800	399680	Hopefully, some of these people will wake up from their fantasies,
399680	402400	and realize that their actions do have consequences,
402400	404960	no matter how intimate they may be at the time.
404960	406560	These things will catch up to you.
408480	410320	So, who killed Andrew Finch?
410320	411920	I would be interested to hear down below,
411920	413680	who you think bears responsibility,
413680	416800	and what should really be done to make sure this doesn't happen again.
416800	418880	Until then, I'm The Right Opinion,
418880	420080	and I'll see you in the next one.
420080	425280	Who killed Russell Jones?
425280	427200	Why and what's the reason?
428640	431120	Not us, said the managers and record execs,
431120	433360	who treated each arrest like nothing but free press.
