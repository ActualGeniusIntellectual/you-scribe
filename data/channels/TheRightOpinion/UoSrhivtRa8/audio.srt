1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
A necessary question, for a necessary time.

2
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,600
Ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, and Andrew Finch.

3
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,560
Who is he?

4
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,880
Andrew Finch was the man who was shot dead by police on the night of the 28th December,

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,040
responding to a false call in which the SWAT team were deployed. He was 28.

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,000
He lived in Wichita, Kansas, and he had two children.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,320
What had provoked this call was a bunch of kids pissing over a Call of Duty game.

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,920
One of the team threatened to swat the other, the other said go on, and they did.

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,960
However, the individual who encouraged themselves to be swatted provided the

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,160
swatters with a false address, which is also not surprising.

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,520
In fact, if anything, I'm surprised that the people who caught the police were genuinely

12
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,800
thick enough to think that someone would provide a legitimate address.

13
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,800
But anyway, the team passed their information to the known swatter, Tyler Barris.

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,440
As there are ways to conceal your identity in the case of swatting,

15
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,000
they probably thought that by handing it over to someone a bit more discreet,

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,600
they would outsmart this other team.

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,680
But honestly, it's just beyond stupid.

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,280
To make sure the SWAT team turned up, Barris, who also went by the Twitter account,

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,920
Swatistic, made the interaction as dramatic as possible, claimed that he had shot his father

20
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,280
in the head, and that he was holding his mother and brother hostage in the closet,

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,360
all while having poured gasoline over the house.

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:04,880
Obviously, this wasn't the case, the police arrived, and they apprehended Mr. Finn,

23
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,000
and according to reports, when he didn't fully comply with the police requests,

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,320
one officer shot him, and he was pronounced dead following transportation to the local hospital.

25
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,920
Swatting is not new, but this story sticks out because of its tragic outcome.

26
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,960
One innocent man killed because a bunch of kids were salty over a game with a $1.50 wager.

27
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,360
With severe outcomes come severe consequences, and as soon as the outcomes were learned,

28
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,000
every individual involved was looking to point the finger,

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,440
the SWAT of the game as law enforcement scrambling for justification,

30
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,840
or information that could lead to a clearer picture.

31
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,040
But things are never that simple, who is to blame?

32
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,920
There's a song called Who Killed Russell Jones by Dolan V,

33
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,440
a spoken word piece where he discusses the people who could have contributed

34
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,680
to the premature demise of old Dirty Bastard from a first-person perspective,

35
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,120
defending their actions as merely participating in the culture.

36
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,080
I want you to hold this thought while we take a trip into the

37
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,320
current culture that preceded this tragedy.

38
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,120
Swatting is not a rare event, it has been a thing for years now,

39
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,360
as Keemstar himself said, the first time he was ever swatted was in 2010,

40
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,600
and he was hardly a big fish back then.

41
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,040
Plenty of famous streamers and gamers have been the victims of swatting,

42
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,800
and in fact, many would argue that it's a risk you now have to anticipate

43
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,880
if you want to participate in the industry.

44
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,080
Once again, a majority of people realise it's a scummy thing to do,

45
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,600
but think, well, it doesn't have any particular long-term consequences,

46
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,440
it's a dick thing to do, but they're probably just dicks anyway, so let's do it.

47
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,920
The gamers were just passionate and passionate people who do stupid things, it was a one-off.

48
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,480
They couldn't anticipate the extreme nature of the swat call,

49
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,240
nor could they have thought in their wildest dreams

50
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,240
that it would lead to someone being shot and killed.

51
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,240
They were naive, but not murderers.

52
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,560
Then you have the swat of Tyler Barris who made the call,

53
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,480
some say that the call was particularly awful,

54
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,960
but I highly doubt it was anything exceptional for Barris,

55
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,880
who puts in an Oscar-worthy performance of a psychotic child in a man's body,

56
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,320
prompting the release of The Unit.

57
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,920
Once again, he basically said he was involved, but not solely accountable.

58
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,920
How could he anticipate such consequences?

59
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,640
He's been doing it forever, and nothing ever happened.

60
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,640
In his Twitter, he claimed he didn't kill anyone

61
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,200
because he wasn't the one who pulled the trigger.

62
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,840
Un-fucking-believable.

63
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,000
So who was the person who pulled the trigger?

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,640
Well, the swat officer, who is currently on paid leave.

65
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,520
From what we understand,

66
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,640
when Andrew Finch the father didn't raise both hands in accordance,

67
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,800
this officer in question misinterpreted this

68
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,120
as a reach for the weapons and shot Mr Finch.

69
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,480
Now it's important to remember that just because one wrong has been committed

70
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,960
doesn't mean that the officer is completely vindicated.

71
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,640
He could have still acted rationally or against how they are coordinated too,

72
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,120
and although the call made by Barris was definitely severe,

73
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,520
they always have an obligation to not let their conduct be affected by such factors.

74
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,120
As the officers are always permitted to shoot with reasonable proof of threat,

75
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,680
they'll have to carry out a separate investigation,

76
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,080
and I hope it will be done thoroughly and honestly,

77
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,360
in spite of the fact that my faith in authority is always fairly low.

78
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
But obviously the officer wouldn't have been there

79
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,320
if there hadn't been a hoax SWAT call put in in the first place,

80
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,720
which was ridiculously exaggerated.

81
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,920
Officers are not expected to let circumstances influence them,

82
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,440
but they are human beings, and it sometimes happens.

83
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,280
We live in a world of probabilities,

84
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,120
99.9% of SWAT calls may not end in casualties,

85
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,240
but for each factor that plays in the illegitimate SWAT call,

86
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,160
the false address, the itchy trigger finger,

87
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,560
the victim who doesn't quite cooperate with the request,

88
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,920
one time these will all align and something goes wrong.

89
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,520
You have a group of heavily armed individuals responding to a call

90
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,840
about someone who is believed to be extremely dangerous.

91
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,920
It's an outcome that has to be acknowledged,

92
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,160
and every now and then it will be realized.

93
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,840
SWAT teams are very professional,

94
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,680
and once again that officer's conduct will be judged on an independent basis,

95
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,960
but the fact that they're very professional and don't often kill civilians

96
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,040
doesn't give you any right to do it.

97
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,360
And if you say, well most things entail risks,

98
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,040
that shouldn't deter people from doing them,

99
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,520
you miss the point, it's a cost-benefit analysis,

100
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,760
and there is no benefit other than shits and giggles for juvenile man-children.

101
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,600
It wastes police time, resources,

102
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,880
and causes unnecessary emotional stress for many, many people,

103
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,280
and I hope you understand those consequences now.

104
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,480
For those who made it this far,

105
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,960
I want to call back on the story of B. Dolan,

106
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,800
of who killed Russell Jones.

107
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,400
On the pragmatic basis, it was drugs, cocaine, and tramadol,

108
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,480
but as Dolan eloquently unravels,

109
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,800
what really killed him was the toxic culture

110
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,200
that had leaned towards glorifying destructive behavior for vacuous fulfillment.

111
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,480
For Andrew Finch, from the stands, it was a bullet that killed him,

112
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,240
but what really killed him was a plague

113
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,200
that should have been stamped out while many had the chance to.

114
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,200
For you and I, and many gamers, the idea of SWATing is deeply troubling,

115
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,280
but there are clearly some people who believe that,

116
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,640
because they're not the SWAT team,

117
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,400
because they're not the ones holding the weapons,

118
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,640
they cannot be responsible for the consequences

119
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,800
that befall many innocent citizens.

120
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,680
Hopefully, some of these people will wake up from their fantasies,

121
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,400
and realize that their actions do have consequences,

122
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,960
no matter how intimate they may be at the time.

123
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,560
These things will catch up to you.

124
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,320
So, who killed Andrew Finch?

125
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,920
I would be interested to hear down below,

126
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,680
who you think bears responsibility,

127
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,800
and what should really be done to make sure this doesn't happen again.

128
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,880
Until then, I'm The Right Opinion,

129
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,080
and I'll see you in the next one.

130
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,280
Who killed Russell Jones?

131
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,200
Why and what's the reason?

132
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,120
Not us, said the managers and record execs,

133
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,360
who treated each arrest like nothing but free press.
