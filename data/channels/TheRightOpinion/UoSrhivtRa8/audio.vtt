00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
A necessary question, for a necessary time.

00:23.600 --> 00:27.600
Ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, and Andrew Finch.

00:27.600 --> 00:28.560
Who is he?

00:28.560 --> 00:32.880
Andrew Finch was the man who was shot dead by police on the night of the 28th December,

00:32.880 --> 00:37.040
responding to a false call in which the SWAT team were deployed. He was 28.

00:37.040 --> 00:40.000
He lived in Wichita, Kansas, and he had two children.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.320
What had provoked this call was a bunch of kids pissing over a Call of Duty game.

00:44.320 --> 00:47.920
One of the team threatened to swat the other, the other said go on, and they did.

00:47.920 --> 00:50.960
However, the individual who encouraged themselves to be swatted provided the

00:50.960 --> 00:54.160
swatters with a false address, which is also not surprising.

00:54.160 --> 00:57.520
In fact, if anything, I'm surprised that the people who caught the police were genuinely

00:57.520 --> 01:00.800
thick enough to think that someone would provide a legitimate address.

01:00.800 --> 01:04.800
But anyway, the team passed their information to the known swatter, Tyler Barris.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.440
As there are ways to conceal your identity in the case of swatting,

01:07.440 --> 01:10.000
they probably thought that by handing it over to someone a bit more discreet,

01:10.000 --> 01:11.600
they would outsmart this other team.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.680
But honestly, it's just beyond stupid.

01:13.680 --> 01:17.280
To make sure the SWAT team turned up, Barris, who also went by the Twitter account,

01:17.280 --> 01:21.920
Swatistic, made the interaction as dramatic as possible, claimed that he had shot his father

01:21.920 --> 01:25.280
in the head, and that he was holding his mother and brother hostage in the closet,

01:25.280 --> 01:27.360
all while having poured gasoline over the house.

01:55.280 --> 02:04.880
Obviously, this wasn't the case, the police arrived, and they apprehended Mr. Finn,

02:04.880 --> 02:08.000
and according to reports, when he didn't fully comply with the police requests,

02:08.000 --> 02:12.320
one officer shot him, and he was pronounced dead following transportation to the local hospital.

02:12.320 --> 02:15.920
Swatting is not new, but this story sticks out because of its tragic outcome.

02:15.920 --> 02:20.960
One innocent man killed because a bunch of kids were salty over a game with a $1.50 wager.

02:20.960 --> 02:25.360
With severe outcomes come severe consequences, and as soon as the outcomes were learned,

02:25.360 --> 02:28.000
every individual involved was looking to point the finger,

02:28.000 --> 02:31.440
the SWAT of the game as law enforcement scrambling for justification,

02:31.440 --> 02:33.840
or information that could lead to a clearer picture.

02:33.840 --> 02:37.040
But things are never that simple, who is to blame?

02:37.040 --> 02:39.920
There's a song called Who Killed Russell Jones by Dolan V,

02:39.920 --> 02:43.440
a spoken word piece where he discusses the people who could have contributed

02:43.440 --> 02:47.680
to the premature demise of old Dirty Bastard from a first-person perspective,

02:47.680 --> 02:51.120
defending their actions as merely participating in the culture.

02:51.120 --> 02:54.080
I want you to hold this thought while we take a trip into the

02:54.080 --> 02:56.320
current culture that preceded this tragedy.

02:56.320 --> 02:59.120
Swatting is not a rare event, it has been a thing for years now,

02:59.120 --> 03:03.360
as Keemstar himself said, the first time he was ever swatted was in 2010,

03:03.360 --> 03:05.600
and he was hardly a big fish back then.

03:05.600 --> 03:09.040
Plenty of famous streamers and gamers have been the victims of swatting,

03:09.040 --> 03:12.800
and in fact, many would argue that it's a risk you now have to anticipate

03:12.800 --> 03:14.880
if you want to participate in the industry.

03:14.880 --> 03:18.080
Once again, a majority of people realise it's a scummy thing to do,

03:18.080 --> 03:21.600
but think, well, it doesn't have any particular long-term consequences,

03:21.600 --> 03:25.440
it's a dick thing to do, but they're probably just dicks anyway, so let's do it.

03:25.440 --> 03:29.920
The gamers were just passionate and passionate people who do stupid things, it was a one-off.

03:29.920 --> 03:32.480
They couldn't anticipate the extreme nature of the swat call,

03:32.480 --> 03:34.240
nor could they have thought in their wildest dreams

03:34.240 --> 03:36.240
that it would lead to someone being shot and killed.

03:36.240 --> 03:38.240
They were naive, but not murderers.

03:38.240 --> 03:40.560
Then you have the swat of Tyler Barris who made the call,

03:40.560 --> 03:42.480
some say that the call was particularly awful,

03:42.480 --> 03:44.960
but I highly doubt it was anything exceptional for Barris,

03:44.960 --> 03:48.880
who puts in an Oscar-worthy performance of a psychotic child in a man's body,

03:48.880 --> 03:50.320
prompting the release of The Unit.

03:50.320 --> 03:53.920
Once again, he basically said he was involved, but not solely accountable.

03:53.920 --> 03:55.920
How could he anticipate such consequences?

03:55.920 --> 03:58.640
He's been doing it forever, and nothing ever happened.

03:58.640 --> 04:00.640
In his Twitter, he claimed he didn't kill anyone

04:00.640 --> 04:03.200
because he wasn't the one who pulled the trigger.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.840
Un-fucking-believable.

04:05.840 --> 04:08.000
So who was the person who pulled the trigger?

04:08.000 --> 04:10.640
Well, the swat officer, who is currently on paid leave.

04:10.640 --> 04:11.520
From what we understand,

04:11.520 --> 04:14.640
when Andrew Finch the father didn't raise both hands in accordance,

04:14.640 --> 04:16.800
this officer in question misinterpreted this

04:16.800 --> 04:19.120
as a reach for the weapons and shot Mr Finch.

04:19.120 --> 04:22.480
Now it's important to remember that just because one wrong has been committed

04:22.480 --> 04:24.960
doesn't mean that the officer is completely vindicated.

04:24.960 --> 04:28.640
He could have still acted rationally or against how they are coordinated too,

04:28.640 --> 04:31.120
and although the call made by Barris was definitely severe,

04:31.120 --> 04:35.520
they always have an obligation to not let their conduct be affected by such factors.

04:35.520 --> 04:39.120
As the officers are always permitted to shoot with reasonable proof of threat,

04:39.200 --> 04:41.680
they'll have to carry out a separate investigation,

04:41.680 --> 04:44.080
and I hope it will be done thoroughly and honestly,

04:44.080 --> 04:47.360
in spite of the fact that my faith in authority is always fairly low.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.360
But obviously the officer wouldn't have been there

04:49.360 --> 04:52.320
if there hadn't been a hoax SWAT call put in in the first place,

04:52.320 --> 04:54.720
which was ridiculously exaggerated.

04:54.720 --> 04:57.920
Officers are not expected to let circumstances influence them,

04:57.920 --> 05:01.440
but they are human beings, and it sometimes happens.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.280
We live in a world of probabilities,

05:03.280 --> 05:07.120
99.9% of SWAT calls may not end in casualties,

05:07.120 --> 05:10.240
but for each factor that plays in the illegitimate SWAT call,

05:10.240 --> 05:12.160
the false address, the itchy trigger finger,

05:12.160 --> 05:14.560
the victim who doesn't quite cooperate with the request,

05:14.560 --> 05:17.920
one time these will all align and something goes wrong.

05:17.920 --> 05:21.520
You have a group of heavily armed individuals responding to a call

05:21.520 --> 05:23.840
about someone who is believed to be extremely dangerous.

05:23.840 --> 05:25.920
It's an outcome that has to be acknowledged,

05:25.920 --> 05:28.160
and every now and then it will be realized.

05:28.160 --> 05:29.840
SWAT teams are very professional,

05:29.840 --> 05:33.680
and once again that officer's conduct will be judged on an independent basis,

05:33.680 --> 05:36.960
but the fact that they're very professional and don't often kill civilians

05:36.960 --> 05:39.040
doesn't give you any right to do it.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.360
And if you say, well most things entail risks,

05:41.360 --> 05:43.040
that shouldn't deter people from doing them,

05:43.040 --> 05:45.520
you miss the point, it's a cost-benefit analysis,

05:45.520 --> 05:49.760
and there is no benefit other than shits and giggles for juvenile man-children.

05:49.760 --> 05:51.600
It wastes police time, resources,

05:51.600 --> 05:54.880
and causes unnecessary emotional stress for many, many people,

05:54.880 --> 05:57.280
and I hope you understand those consequences now.

05:57.280 --> 05:58.480
For those who made it this far,

05:58.480 --> 06:00.960
I want to call back on the story of B. Dolan,

06:00.960 --> 06:02.800
of who killed Russell Jones.

06:02.800 --> 06:06.400
On the pragmatic basis, it was drugs, cocaine, and tramadol,

06:06.400 --> 06:08.480
but as Dolan eloquently unravels,

06:08.480 --> 06:10.800
what really killed him was the toxic culture

06:10.800 --> 06:15.200
that had leaned towards glorifying destructive behavior for vacuous fulfillment.

06:15.200 --> 06:18.480
For Andrew Finch, from the stands, it was a bullet that killed him,

06:18.480 --> 06:20.240
but what really killed him was a plague

06:20.240 --> 06:23.200
that should have been stamped out while many had the chance to.

06:23.200 --> 06:27.200
For you and I, and many gamers, the idea of SWATing is deeply troubling,

06:27.200 --> 06:29.280
but there are clearly some people who believe that,

06:29.280 --> 06:30.640
because they're not the SWAT team,

06:30.640 --> 06:32.400
because they're not the ones holding the weapons,

06:32.480 --> 06:34.640
they cannot be responsible for the consequences

06:34.640 --> 06:36.800
that befall many innocent citizens.

06:36.800 --> 06:39.680
Hopefully, some of these people will wake up from their fantasies,

06:39.680 --> 06:42.400
and realize that their actions do have consequences,

06:42.400 --> 06:44.960
no matter how intimate they may be at the time.

06:44.960 --> 06:46.560
These things will catch up to you.

06:48.480 --> 06:50.320
So, who killed Andrew Finch?

06:50.320 --> 06:51.920
I would be interested to hear down below,

06:51.920 --> 06:53.680
who you think bears responsibility,

06:53.680 --> 06:56.800
and what should really be done to make sure this doesn't happen again.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.880
Until then, I'm The Right Opinion,

06:58.880 --> 07:00.080
and I'll see you in the next one.

07:00.080 --> 07:05.280
Who killed Russell Jones?

07:05.280 --> 07:07.200
Why and what's the reason?

07:08.640 --> 07:11.120
Not us, said the managers and record execs,

07:11.120 --> 07:13.360
who treated each arrest like nothing but free press.
