Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:18.060 --> 00:22.140
too much free time, and I have a thoroughly diverse audience.

00:22.140 --> 00:26.440
And in a way that some would expect, but because I'm so integrated with many commentators

00:26.440 --> 00:30.840
I can occasionally lose sight of this, despite the fact that I know I have people who don't

00:30.840 --> 00:34.800
even follow what's going on with people like Fouseytube, despite it being spoken about

00:34.800 --> 00:36.680
non-stop in my circles.

00:36.680 --> 00:40.600
In fact, I clearly have a significant amount of people who are more interested in today's

00:40.600 --> 00:45.120
topic, which is also interesting to me, because although admittedly I am fairly familiar with

00:45.120 --> 00:49.720
the individual in question, it kind of falls outside the typical content that I would turn

00:49.720 --> 00:50.720
to.

00:50.720 --> 00:54.480
However, with that said, my Doug Walker video did very well, and that was, in a way, in

00:54.480 --> 00:58.600
the same vein, so I only think it's justified to discuss this person, who once again, some

00:58.600 --> 01:02.920
of you will be very familiar with, and some of you will probably have never heard of.

01:02.920 --> 01:06.220
Some of you might be big fans of him, others may despise him.

01:06.220 --> 01:11.060
One thing I know is that these less commentary, more niche topics provoke strong feelings

01:11.060 --> 01:15.400
within individuals, to the point where they may yield rather strong opinions.

01:15.400 --> 01:19.840
So I don't expect this to go down fantastically with everyone, but I don't do it to please

01:19.840 --> 01:20.840
everyone.

01:20.840 --> 01:23.960
I do it for the people who want to enjoy my content, and if you want to come along for

01:23.960 --> 01:28.560
the ride, then you're more than welcome to join me on this lovely little road trip.

01:28.560 --> 01:33.000
And many people have asked me to do a video on this chap, so it clearly does have an appeal,

01:33.000 --> 01:37.160
and hopefully today I can provide a more impartial look at everything he's said and done, and

01:37.160 --> 01:39.560
give some thoughts and opinions.

01:39.560 --> 01:40.560
It's in the name.

01:40.560 --> 01:44.640
Also, once again, I know this will be a late coverage of the topic, but I prefer to wait

01:44.640 --> 01:48.500
until all the dust has settled before pulling out the duster, if you know what I mean.

01:48.500 --> 01:52.760
It also allows me to have a look at what more can be said, rather than just observing the

01:52.760 --> 01:54.640
current drama that is going down.

01:54.640 --> 01:59.680
So let's briefly have a rundown of why Butch Hartman is of interest, because on the surface,

01:59.680 --> 02:04.420
if you were just scrolling through his Wikipedia page, Butch Hartman has no right to be involved

02:04.420 --> 02:05.940
in the YouTube community.

02:05.940 --> 02:09.760
If you're an internet casual, like most people, you wouldn't be able to tell him apart from

02:09.760 --> 02:12.260
any other TV producer or animator.

02:12.260 --> 02:17.140
But as we're going to find out today, there's a lot to distinguish him beneath the surface.

02:17.140 --> 02:21.860
So to people who are unfamiliar with this gentleman, Butch Hartman is a multi-talented

02:21.860 --> 02:26.600
individual in children's cartoons, he has produced many popular TV shows, the one that

02:26.600 --> 02:31.140
you lot are probably most conversant with is The Fairly Odd Parents, a show that I used

02:31.140 --> 02:32.140
to adore growing up.

02:32.140 --> 02:36.240
It's the sort of thing that, in spite of its rather ostentatious attitude, just has

02:36.240 --> 02:41.080
the plots to really inspire the imagination with all these possibilities of a fantastical

02:41.080 --> 02:42.480
world that it creates.

02:42.480 --> 02:46.660
Given where I lived and the sort of TV service that we used to receive, I never really had

02:46.660 --> 02:51.600
the opportunity to watch it on a regular basis, so any time I did was a real luxury.

02:51.600 --> 02:56.120
However, that is merely a ripple in the ocean that is his career, and he has helped produce

02:56.120 --> 03:01.440
many other children's television shows including Danny Phantom, Tough Puppy, and Dexter's

03:01.440 --> 03:05.680
Laboratory, which although it's something that we wouldn't think about too much as kids,

03:05.680 --> 03:08.440
it's easy to see the striking stylistic similarities.

03:08.440 --> 03:10.480
Ooh, that was some nice alliteration.

03:10.480 --> 03:15.160
Anyhow, before I become too caught up in my own language, let me make it clear, it's no

03:15.160 --> 03:19.960
criticism that you have consistency in your animations, plenty of franchises have a lot

03:19.960 --> 03:24.480
of overlap in their technique, if you can evolve storylines and characters in a compelling

03:24.480 --> 03:29.800
fashion then having a formula for animation is merely an unchanging cog in a greater machine.

03:29.800 --> 03:33.920
But anyway, Butch Hartman, through this signature flair, created a real following, typically

03:33.920 --> 03:38.480
when you have something unique and defining like that is what happens, much alike to Doug

03:38.480 --> 03:42.560
Walker, that whether you personally loved him or hated him, there was an undeniable

03:42.560 --> 03:44.520
appeal to what he created.

03:44.520 --> 03:49.520
He also really involved himself online, particularly using his Twitter, as means to create a relationship

03:49.560 --> 03:53.760
with his fans, and often involving himself in many online trends and memes, leading to

03:53.760 --> 03:57.760
the same interesting results, although they were mildly entertaining.

03:57.760 --> 04:02.640
He'd also provide his daily dose of wisdom, which typically inspired people to go and,

04:02.640 --> 04:07.880
well, retweet it, can't knock the impressions, but Hartman clearly made good impressions.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.120
So why are we here today?

04:09.120 --> 04:13.260
Well, there have been numerous controversies surrounding some of his recent projects and

04:13.260 --> 04:17.400
also comments that he's made, people DM'd me and tweeted me about it, and eventually

04:17.400 --> 04:21.820
after working on two other videos that I hope are out by now, I contacted one of these

04:21.820 --> 04:24.080
people and said, hit me with your best shot.

04:24.080 --> 04:28.840
It is only fair to credit them as they have provided me with an extensive backlog of information,

04:28.840 --> 04:30.800
some of which I have used, some of which I have not.

04:30.800 --> 04:34.200
Their Twitter page should be up on the screen right now, so feel free to follow them.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.480
I'll also leave a link in the pinned comment.

04:36.480 --> 04:40.880
I knew about a lot of these situations on the surface because I saw a lot of discourse,

04:40.880 --> 04:43.240
and of course, any drama takes my interest.

04:43.240 --> 04:46.960
However, it is important that you feel fully informed on what's happening before you make

04:46.960 --> 04:47.960
such comments.

04:47.960 --> 04:52.800
So without further ado, let's discuss everything that has inspired such a sudden turn on a

04:52.800 --> 04:55.880
person, and ask ourselves what can be drawn from it.

04:55.880 --> 05:07.280
Now it's hard to document this in a clear chronological order because a lot of things

05:07.280 --> 05:10.200
were revealed at different times as to when they happened.

05:10.200 --> 05:14.160
However, it all seemed to snowball when he created a Kickstarter for something known

05:14.160 --> 05:15.160
as Oaxis.

05:15.160 --> 05:19.440
You see, in February Butch Hartman announced that he had departed Nickelodeon.

05:19.440 --> 05:23.640
The video was mostly him just fondly reflecting on his career with the company, with the notion

05:23.640 --> 05:25.560
that he left because he felt it was time.

05:25.560 --> 05:30.000
He had been working there 20 years, and as fun as something can be, sometimes you do

05:30.000 --> 05:33.720
need a change, so nothing seemed particularly out of the ordinary here.

05:33.720 --> 05:38.240
He made a lot of vague, open comments that kind of gave him the option to go anywhere,

05:38.240 --> 05:41.200
while still remaining consistent with some sort of trajectory.

05:41.200 --> 05:45.280
So June came around, and he finally decided to make a serious announcement, one that would

05:45.280 --> 05:50.280
finally serve as a sufficient follow-on for his fans, as to where his work was going.

05:50.280 --> 05:51.560
What was it, I hear you ask?

05:51.560 --> 05:53.240
Well, it was his own network.

05:53.240 --> 05:58.480
In a video titled I'm Starting a New Network, all in big, sexy capital letters, to really

05:58.480 --> 06:03.560
give it that emphatic vibe, he announced that he was, believe it or not, starting a new

06:03.560 --> 06:04.560
network.

06:04.560 --> 06:08.200
Now this was presented as a competitor to all the other large networks, however there

06:08.200 --> 06:09.480
was a spin.

06:09.480 --> 06:14.320
He was going to be, in vain of many of the other recent initiatives, consumer-oriented.

06:14.320 --> 06:19.480
He rightfully points out that a lot of corporations have no deeper relationship with their audience,

06:19.480 --> 06:22.060
and says that he can present that himself.

06:22.060 --> 06:26.520
This is followed by a very interesting advert, where he really talks about key values being

06:26.520 --> 06:31.280
eroded away by modern life, and then presenting the network as the solution.

06:31.280 --> 06:34.600
It was also announced that this was going to be a Kickstarter, with his initial goal

06:34.600 --> 06:37.120
being set at $250,000.

06:37.120 --> 06:41.040
This would cover the costs of producers, and aid the creation of family-friendly shows

06:41.040 --> 06:42.920
about positive subject matters.

06:42.920 --> 06:55.120
I have to admit, it is an intriguing initiative, in spite of the meme baits.

06:55.120 --> 06:59.320
This initially reminded me of DeFranco's fundraising project to support his own independent

06:59.320 --> 07:03.640
news network, and generally as long as someone's transparent with the distribution of such

07:03.640 --> 07:07.280
funds then I don't think you can really complain, and although I think it is necessary

07:07.280 --> 07:10.920
to talk about the worst things going on in the world, we can't constantly hide in the

07:10.920 --> 07:13.640
bubble of pseudo-family positive values.

07:13.640 --> 07:18.640
However, as a brief refuge for wholesome family time, it's not a bad idea, given the race

07:18.640 --> 07:22.840
to the bottom of sensationalism that a lot of the media do tend to be participating in

07:22.840 --> 07:23.840
currently.

07:23.840 --> 07:27.360
So although there was a possible discussion to be had about the sort of values that Hartman

07:27.360 --> 07:31.840
would be adopting, it was mostly calm at this point, but there is always calm before the

07:31.840 --> 07:32.840
storm.

07:33.040 --> 07:37.080
This is where it begins to become quite suspicious, after setting up the Kickstarter, he hit the

07:37.080 --> 07:41.400
target surprisingly quickly, with a number of donors from certain locations.

07:41.400 --> 07:45.540
Although it's completely reasonable to suggest that maybe he just had a devoted fanbase with

07:45.540 --> 07:49.360
a few individuals who are fairly stacked, many felt there were some strings being pulled

07:49.360 --> 07:50.720
behind the scenes.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.360
Well why on earth would that be?

07:52.360 --> 07:56.240
Well Hartman himself has always been fairly well intertwined with deep core Christian

07:56.240 --> 07:57.240
values.

08:26.240 --> 08:42.240
And let us be clear here, there is nothing wrong with having religious beliefs, if it

08:42.240 --> 08:46.080
makes you a better person then more power to you for it, however in the video it is

08:46.080 --> 08:50.340
fairly safe to say he does not present the network as a religious venture.

08:50.340 --> 08:55.280
And as a donor I'd say knowing the endorsements and vested interests of a possible recipient

08:55.320 --> 08:58.880
is key, and that he did actively omit it.

08:58.880 --> 09:04.480
But is this active deception, or just a failure to disclose details that he deemed unnecessary?

09:04.480 --> 09:08.800
Well that would depend on how much this religious agenda was involved in the platform, it shouldn't

09:08.800 --> 09:13.080
have really come as a surprise to anyone that this was going to involve Christian values,

09:13.080 --> 09:17.960
the idea that society is being eroded by media and there's a necessity to return to core

09:17.960 --> 09:20.680
family principles is inherently religious.

09:20.680 --> 09:25.040
Why were things like homosexuality for example absolutely abhorred by a lot of religious

09:25.040 --> 09:27.580
figures, and still are to an extent?

09:27.580 --> 09:29.740
Because they upset their social order.

09:29.740 --> 09:34.100
Now the more modern approach is that there are more disruptive elements than homosexuality

09:34.100 --> 09:37.500
and you can still have a warm, healthy family with that.

09:37.500 --> 09:42.200
And threats like exposure to violence, explicit content and so on are more troublesome to

09:42.200 --> 09:45.200
today's youth than what adults do with their sex life.

09:45.200 --> 09:49.980
However you can still see where it is rooted, what Butch is presenting is just a more modern

09:49.980 --> 09:55.020
version of Christian values, given how much he utilised the Christian community he probably

09:55.020 --> 09:59.240
should have disclosed this, he knows that he also has a young fanbase of animators who

09:59.240 --> 10:03.540
probably don't know that much history to put the dots together on what Butch's values

10:03.540 --> 10:04.540
represent.

10:04.540 --> 10:07.900
He's made it no secret that he's a devout Christian, but I still think it's worth

10:07.900 --> 10:12.060
talking about, especially given how deeply associated it turned out to be.

10:12.060 --> 10:14.100
So how deeply associated was it?

10:14.100 --> 10:19.020
I mean in all the seminars he didn't necessarily present it as an exclusively Christian streaming

10:19.060 --> 10:23.520
service, however it was clear from the advertisers, from the fundraisers, from the comments that

10:23.520 --> 10:27.860
he made that he was trying to appeal to the Christian audience and I think this created

10:27.860 --> 10:32.700
a justified concern within the more animation oriented fans, because the whole hook of this

10:32.700 --> 10:36.980
network presented in the original YouTube video was that this was going to be a streaming

10:36.980 --> 10:39.220
site that is oriented for the viewer.

10:39.220 --> 10:43.680
Which on principle is a pretty good idea, however there were a unique set of circumstances

10:43.680 --> 10:47.500
that makes this unassailable, and thus rather unfair to not include.

10:47.500 --> 10:52.900
We're going to speak to them in parables, guys I am not picking TBN, this is not TBN,

10:52.900 --> 10:57.900
this is not the church channel, it's not Golden Eagle Broadcasting or Daystar, God bless

10:57.900 --> 11:03.900
those people, it's amazing, my stuff has got to be today, it's got to be hip, it's

11:03.900 --> 11:07.900
got to be cool, it's got to reach the secular people.

11:07.900 --> 11:11.900
If I put a Christian network out there, no problem, I've got Christians, that's cool,

11:11.900 --> 11:15.900
but I'm missing the entire other spectrum of the world.

11:15.900 --> 11:20.140
You see, he is directly trying to appeal to two demographics that are pretty diametrically

11:20.140 --> 11:21.260
opposed to each other.

11:21.260 --> 11:25.380
Now I'm not best friends with every animator and artist out there, but one thing that I

11:25.380 --> 11:29.460
will tell you is that in that community there is a proportionally high population made up

11:29.460 --> 11:34.720
by people who would be labelled by a fundamental Christian society as deviants, and many who

11:34.720 --> 11:38.760
have had overwhelmingly negative experiences with Christian values.

11:38.760 --> 11:42.260
How do you cater to people who want to impose them, while still catering to people who want

11:42.260 --> 11:43.620
to oppose them?

11:43.620 --> 11:47.700
Listen, maybe there is a way, maybe you can find a compromise that brings everyone together

11:47.700 --> 11:52.500
regardless of their background, however you have to lay out how you're going to do that,

11:52.500 --> 11:54.280
what values you're going to promote.

11:54.280 --> 11:58.380
By omitting this information completely, it appears Hartman knew that this would create

11:58.380 --> 12:02.100
a conflict, and instead of addressing it, he decided that it would be better to deceive

12:02.100 --> 12:05.620
both parties into thinking that he could cater to both of them.

12:05.620 --> 12:09.440
And maybe he could, but he shouldn't have had the hubris to think that he could deceive

12:09.440 --> 12:12.940
them too, and that was one of the biggest mistakes he made.

12:12.940 --> 12:17.820
Remember Hartman probably had a vision, and two core fanbases that he could appeal to,

12:17.820 --> 12:23.740
and maybe he thought that it was for the greater good, but sometimes not everyone is going

12:23.740 --> 12:28.340
to see your ends, and at the same time you have to acknowledge that your visions may

12:28.340 --> 12:30.340
be wrong.

12:30.340 --> 12:41.300
However let's talk about his little vision, shall we?

12:41.300 --> 12:46.220
When I was speaking about Fusi, I referred to his fallacious appeal to celestial powers,

12:46.220 --> 12:51.380
and I have to admit the last person I was expecting to compare Butch Hartman to was

12:51.380 --> 12:53.420
Mr. Erekat here.

12:53.420 --> 12:58.220
However like Erekat, Hartman is clearly under the impression that God has some greater plan

12:58.220 --> 13:01.520
for him, and God brought him to this situation.

13:01.520 --> 13:05.900
When things have worked out with the level of perseverance they have with Hartman, it

13:05.900 --> 13:11.140
is easy to believe that a consistent level of motivation will continue to turn up results,

13:11.140 --> 13:15.540
but many of us, particularly people who may be considering investment, need more faith

13:15.540 --> 13:16.860
to turn up results.

13:16.860 --> 13:21.420
Saying God's plan is all very well and good, but many people do not see it that way, and

13:21.420 --> 13:25.980
this was well expressed in the many videos criticising him, and many incriminating clips

13:25.980 --> 13:30.380
showing the conflict of demographics that he was attempting to appeal to behind the

13:30.380 --> 13:46.620
others back.

13:46.620 --> 13:50.460
So what do you do when others post videos that do seem to show a side of you that you

13:50.460 --> 13:51.700
don't want them to see?

13:51.700 --> 13:56.060
Well in many instances, it seems the response has been to take them down.

13:56.060 --> 14:00.040
Generally what was incriminating about this particular appearance was that it was somewhere

14:00.080 --> 14:02.680
called the Warnau Wealth Builder Conference.

14:02.680 --> 14:04.700
This is based around Lance Warnau.

14:04.700 --> 14:10.380
Now I'm not going to criticise the conferences you talk at, however, if something seems credible,

14:10.380 --> 14:11.380
you have to address it.

14:11.380 --> 14:13.200
What do I mean exactly?

14:13.200 --> 14:17.520
Well many people pointed out that Lance Warnau has some interesting beliefs that fit in far

14:17.520 --> 14:20.480
too nicely with Butch Hartman's little escapade.

14:20.480 --> 14:24.840
You see there's this doctrine called the Seven Mountains, which, well, is a whole different

14:24.840 --> 14:26.040
barrel of fish really.

14:26.040 --> 14:30.480
It basically proposes that Christianity is losing its grip on modern culture, and proposes

14:30.480 --> 14:34.480
techniques of working how to modernise its appeal while having the traditionalist grip

14:34.480 --> 14:36.560
on the values that they view as moral.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.560
However, here's where it becomes trippy.

14:38.560 --> 14:42.620
You see here, good old Dr. Lance, the host of this convention, is the person who was

14:42.620 --> 14:46.680
also very prominent in the creation of the Seven Mountain Theory.

14:46.680 --> 14:50.640
One of the Seven Mountains is the arts and entertainment industry, and in Butch Hartman's

14:50.640 --> 14:54.680
speech he gave, he makes some very suspicious comments that seem consistent with the dogma

14:54.680 --> 14:56.920
the ideology seems to be supporting.

14:56.920 --> 15:00.640
If you want a more in-depth look at all this, there's a very interesting document that

15:00.640 --> 15:04.760
I'll leave in the description below which sets up a little more of the mere circumstantial

15:04.760 --> 15:05.760
evidence.

15:05.760 --> 15:08.480
So what people created now was a different story.

15:08.480 --> 15:12.660
Butch not being an idiot, knows that if he presents this as a Christian network, no one

15:12.660 --> 15:17.280
will support it, after all, do many people here ever watch openly Christian channels?

15:17.280 --> 15:21.420
So many came to this conclusion that this was no longer a platform merely inspired by

15:21.420 --> 15:26.800
Christian values, it was a Trojan Horse presented under the guise of family values, but actually

15:26.800 --> 15:32.140
implicitly smuggling in Christian ideas, without any of the backers appeal or knowledge.

15:32.140 --> 15:36.800
Which although certainly by no means a proven theory, does seem somewhat credible.

15:36.800 --> 15:40.320
When presented with a lot of this footage, including footage of him with other seedy

15:40.320 --> 15:44.340
Christian figures, it was swiftly removed, in fact there have been multiple allegations

15:44.340 --> 15:48.820
of him removing content that incriminates him, which is obviously not a good look.

15:48.820 --> 15:53.320
When confronted with evidence against you, you have a few options, you can accept it,

15:53.320 --> 15:57.780
you can dispel it, you can deny it, but you sure as hell should not remove it, it only

15:57.780 --> 16:02.120
implicates you further, and at the same time other people will just re-upload it.

16:02.120 --> 16:05.920
And as soon as you remove one, people will begin downloading and saving content that

16:05.920 --> 16:08.080
implies you have committed wrongdoings.

16:08.080 --> 16:12.120
So eventually this just made him look worse, and many commentators rightfully called him

16:12.120 --> 16:16.200
out, whether he wasn't thinking, or saw it as the only way to save his bacon, it was

16:16.200 --> 16:17.760
a very poor decision.

16:17.760 --> 16:19.820
And when he decided to respond…

16:47.760 --> 16:51.720
That's one thing, but if someone doesn't do anything, and they wanna like, you know,

16:51.720 --> 16:54.460
I don't know, criticise, then I have no time for them.

16:56.620 --> 16:57.620
No time for them.

17:01.060 --> 17:06.660
So the person that asked that question, whose name will not be mentioned, ever, by my lips,

17:06.660 --> 17:11.760
I just wanna tell all people like that, as I get back to safety here, that if you guys

17:11.760 --> 17:14.400
can't do it yourselves, you shouldn't criticise anybody else.

17:14.400 --> 17:15.400
What was the question?

17:15.400 --> 17:17.580
Was someone attacking his animation skills?

17:17.580 --> 17:21.680
Was someone challenging the years that the veteran animator had under his belt?

17:24.680 --> 17:30.080
Oh, in a way it may seem like a trivial moment, but it does imply a lot about how Butch responds

17:30.080 --> 17:31.960
to these criticisms.

17:31.960 --> 17:36.000
The only time you can ever appeal to such an authority is when the authority is relevant

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
to the question.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.280
If someone came up to me and said, the shirt you're wearing doesn't match your jeans,

17:40.280 --> 17:44.200
I can't turn around to them and say, well you're not a semi-famous commentator, so

17:44.200 --> 17:46.140
I shan't listen to your opinions.

17:46.140 --> 17:47.820
It doesn't make logical sense.

17:47.820 --> 17:52.620
On top of that, in my opinion, it's always a bad argument to use, it's incredibly arrogant,

17:52.620 --> 17:57.340
and although experience sometimes can aid credibility, it's not an argument in itself.

17:57.340 --> 18:00.720
All in all though, it's kind of worrying that someone of Butch's age, and I would

18:00.720 --> 18:05.200
hope wisdom, would make such a redundant point, and both these scenarios that seek to justify

18:05.200 --> 18:08.220
a comment tell a rather worrying story about him.

18:08.220 --> 18:13.080
Either he genuinely thinks that's a legitimate retort, or he does not.

18:13.080 --> 18:16.440
Whatever he does, it means that he's going to have serious issues listening to those

18:16.440 --> 18:20.340
who call his judgement into question, because not everyone's going to be an expert, but

18:20.340 --> 18:23.860
people will still have valid points, like the ones we've discussed in this video.

18:23.860 --> 18:28.020
I'm nowhere near as experienced in many of the areas that Butch has spent decades

18:28.020 --> 18:31.860
specialising in, but it doesn't delegitimize any of the points that are being made.

18:31.860 --> 18:35.700
However, if he's going to genuinely dismiss criticism like that, then there is no scope

18:35.700 --> 18:38.060
on Oaxis, because it won't go away.

18:38.060 --> 18:42.140
However, I feel he is smarter than that, and he's more over attempting to appeal to the

18:42.140 --> 18:46.840
easily satisfied sect of his fans through reasoning that positions him above his critics,

18:46.840 --> 18:51.080
which inspires the fact that it antagonises a lot of people, and emboldens his status

18:51.080 --> 18:56.280
as this sort of messiah to his die-hard fans, the ones that he, as a creator, benefits of

18:56.280 --> 18:57.280
the most.

18:57.280 --> 19:01.600
Either he views himself as a messiah which is a recipe for disaster, or he wants to benefit

19:01.600 --> 19:05.520
off those who view him as a messiah, which is honestly worse.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.360
Delusion or deception.

19:07.360 --> 19:12.120
Even if his judgement was better, he has to sell that to people, and he seems so disinterested

19:12.120 --> 19:16.440
that the critics keep coming back, and they were working harder to convince people that

19:16.440 --> 19:19.600
he was wrong, that he was to convince them he was right.

19:19.600 --> 19:20.660
There was no escape.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.860
There were a couple other scandals that I haven't discussed, not because they're not

19:23.860 --> 19:27.460
worth discussing, but mainly because they're kind of more independent to what we're talking

19:27.460 --> 19:28.460
about today.

19:28.460 --> 19:32.200
However, they definitely contributed to the shift in perception, from this well-liked

19:32.200 --> 19:36.920
inspiring animator, to this rather suspect shady character who favoured his own visions

19:36.920 --> 19:41.840
over the well-being of his supporters, and as the pressure finally piled on, he responded

19:41.840 --> 19:46.800
more gracefully.

19:46.800 --> 19:51.160
So bearing in mind that this criticism has been layering on pretty badly, Hartman had

19:51.160 --> 19:56.200
no other option than to address the highly justified suspicions surrounding this channel

19:56.200 --> 19:59.520
and the related ventures that he might be pursuing.

19:59.520 --> 20:03.460
It may have occurred to him that these undertakings are in jeopardy, or maybe he just thought

20:03.460 --> 20:07.980
a more in-depth reply would shut up the detractors, or maybe he genuinely wanted to clear the

20:07.980 --> 20:08.980
air.

20:08.980 --> 20:09.980
So he posted this letter.

20:09.980 --> 20:15.060
The letter itself is eloquent, and in a way, it does really all it can do, decline the

20:15.060 --> 20:16.060
claims.

20:16.060 --> 20:20.660
He can't deny the conventions he spoke at, he can't deny the way he behaved, and he

20:20.660 --> 20:25.140
can't deny any of the mishaps that occurred, however, he can deny the further conclusions

20:25.140 --> 20:28.980
that many people claim about a possible agenda, because that is theoretical.

20:28.980 --> 20:33.340
I'll leave a link in the description for you lads to go and read it and judge for yourself,

20:33.340 --> 20:38.060
but as responses go, it's fairly rudimentary, nothing to write home about.

20:38.060 --> 20:41.720
Nothing you would throw him in too deep for either, though I always feel like starting

20:41.720 --> 20:45.860
off by sending love when you're in the depth of scandal is a rather contrived move, check

20:45.860 --> 20:49.140
out my Greg Paul video explaining why exactly that is.

20:49.140 --> 20:52.060
Best to save the pleasantries until after you've dealt with the allegations.

20:52.060 --> 20:57.300
That's just a pet peeve in this instance though, it's not exactly the same situation.

20:57.300 --> 21:00.020
What do I think this says about the greatest situation?

21:00.020 --> 21:04.020
So in my opinion, there are two plausible scenarios with this little charade.

21:04.020 --> 21:07.740
Because something's happening, it's just hard to necessarily label what degree it's happening

21:07.740 --> 21:08.740
to.

21:08.740 --> 21:13.100
On the one hand, Butch Hartman's idea of Oaxis was merely an innocent-minded venture with

21:13.100 --> 21:15.260
Butch's values at the heart.

21:15.260 --> 21:19.540
Now Butch makes it no secret that his religious roots are highly influential on his values,

21:19.540 --> 21:23.220
and with this in mind, he thought he'd be able to reach his monetary targets by appealing

21:23.220 --> 21:25.180
to church associations as well.

21:25.180 --> 21:28.980
However, he didn't think that many people would care, or knew people would care, and

21:28.980 --> 21:31.020
decided to try and keep the appeal separate.

21:31.020 --> 21:35.520
This was a poor decision, as when you're making content that is being marketed and catered

21:35.520 --> 21:40.100
to the audience, if a significant proportion of the audience is Christians who may perhaps

21:40.100 --> 21:44.500
lean more fundamentally, then it doesn't matter which values you may have, because they might

21:44.500 --> 21:47.600
have values that clash with your more artistic supporters.

21:47.600 --> 21:52.140
And that's the thing, even with the most modest intentions, Butch has made a clear error,

21:52.140 --> 21:56.020
because the donors could really affect the direction the platform moves in, he had to

21:56.020 --> 22:01.020
disclose that, and failing to has really galvanised the wave of criticism against him.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.800
That's his own fault unfortunately.

22:02.800 --> 22:06.180
With regards to the more advanced theories, they do line up well.

22:06.180 --> 22:10.740
Although it is possible that it is coincidental, his response of pulling footage that implicated

22:10.740 --> 22:15.640
him was unbelievably myopic, and only made the idea that this was some sort of conspiracy

22:15.640 --> 22:16.640
more credible.

22:16.640 --> 22:20.680
Whether it was a conspiracy or not, I feel rather confident saying that it would have

22:20.680 --> 22:21.680
failed.

22:21.680 --> 22:25.860
Even if you try and insert subliminal messages, it still means sacrificing part of the appeal

22:25.860 --> 22:26.940
of modern media.

22:26.940 --> 22:31.020
I'm hard pressed to honestly believe that he genuinely thought that such a plan could

22:31.020 --> 22:35.940
exert Christianity onto modern culture, it seems so ridiculous that I'm almost inclined

22:35.940 --> 22:37.820
to give him the benefit of the doubt.

22:37.820 --> 22:42.100
But on the other hand, if someone is motivated by a cause, especially ones that appeal to

22:42.100 --> 22:47.380
a higher power like religion, it can often override a lot of logical reasoning.

22:47.380 --> 22:52.040
Celestial beings do not need justification because they transcend existence, which is

22:52.040 --> 22:53.640
why I'm always sceptical.

22:53.640 --> 22:57.780
Though I'd hope that with his experience, Hartman would be able to recognise such ideas

22:57.780 --> 22:59.000
as lost causes.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.520
However, if I gave Fousey shit for his approach, Butch Hartman doesn't get a pass just because

23:03.520 --> 23:07.600
he speaks with more authority or wisdom than our good mate Yusuf.

23:07.600 --> 23:11.920
Hartman not only behaved childishly himself, he promoted a way of thinking that is designed

23:11.920 --> 23:15.880
to push people who challenged him down, and telling those to trust him because of his

23:15.880 --> 23:17.160
accolades.

23:17.160 --> 23:21.080
Let me tell you something, the moment that you decide to trust authority because of the

23:21.080 --> 23:25.000
fact that it is authority, is the moment that someone will seek to take advantage of

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
that authority.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.200
And on the internet, we're more aware of that than ever, and many people clearly felt that

23:30.200 --> 23:33.020
they were being justifiably taken advantage of.

23:33.020 --> 23:38.240
And whether Hartman had greater plans or not, he was still asking people to trust his judgement,

23:38.240 --> 23:42.780
and it would just turn out fine, even with the vague language and the lack of details

23:42.780 --> 23:44.160
that he provided.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.160
No.

23:45.160 --> 23:49.600
All it takes is one bad actor to fuck that up, and people were right to expect more,

23:49.600 --> 23:52.240
and he paid the price for not delivering it.

23:52.240 --> 23:56.480
However, plenty of people aren't that skeptical, and plenty of people will continue to look

23:56.480 --> 24:02.120
up to him, so he really needs to harness that responsibility, he has to try and hold himself

24:02.120 --> 24:05.560
accountable, because he can't guarantee that we always will.

24:05.560 --> 24:08.200
Anyhow, what do you think about Butch Hartman?

24:08.200 --> 24:11.480
Let me know in the comments down below, I will do my best to reply to them in the first

24:11.480 --> 24:16.480
few hours, though I am really busy at time recording, and a lot is happening in my life.

24:16.480 --> 24:21.040
I would love to give a huge shoutout to the editors who have done another stellar job,

24:21.040 --> 24:25.000
I'm gonna leave their links in the pinned comment, if you could check them out, it would

24:25.000 --> 24:29.560
be fantastic, without them, this channel would not be where it is, I know I say that a lot,

24:29.560 --> 24:34.560
but it really does make a huge difference in my life, and I can't show my appreciation

24:34.560 --> 24:35.560
enough to them.

24:35.560 --> 24:39.200
Also, if you wanna talk to me, and I'm not replying to comments, then you can hit me

24:39.200 --> 24:44.040
up on Twitter, at the right opinion, hit me up on Facebook, I'll leave links to all those

24:44.040 --> 24:47.760
in the description below, and I also have a Discord that I should be using more regularly

24:47.760 --> 24:48.760
now I'm back at university.

24:48.760 --> 24:53.280
Anyhow, I don't think I have too much else to say, once again, thanks for the support

24:53.280 --> 24:58.920
of recent, I hope everyone's having a wonderful day, and continues to have a wonderful day,

24:58.920 --> 25:02.720
or maybe the day is coming to an end, and I hope you've had a wonderful day.

25:02.720 --> 25:07.280
But until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

25:14.040 --> 25:27.720
I'll see you in the next one.
