0	18060	Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
18060	22140	too much free time, and I have a thoroughly diverse audience.
22140	26440	And in a way that some would expect, but because I'm so integrated with many commentators
26440	30840	I can occasionally lose sight of this, despite the fact that I know I have people who don't
30840	34800	even follow what's going on with people like Fouseytube, despite it being spoken about
34800	36680	non-stop in my circles.
36680	40600	In fact, I clearly have a significant amount of people who are more interested in today's
40600	45120	topic, which is also interesting to me, because although admittedly I am fairly familiar with
45120	49720	the individual in question, it kind of falls outside the typical content that I would turn
49720	50720	to.
50720	54480	However, with that said, my Doug Walker video did very well, and that was, in a way, in
54480	58600	the same vein, so I only think it's justified to discuss this person, who once again, some
58600	62920	of you will be very familiar with, and some of you will probably have never heard of.
62920	66220	Some of you might be big fans of him, others may despise him.
66220	71060	One thing I know is that these less commentary, more niche topics provoke strong feelings
71060	75400	within individuals, to the point where they may yield rather strong opinions.
75400	79840	So I don't expect this to go down fantastically with everyone, but I don't do it to please
79840	80840	everyone.
80840	83960	I do it for the people who want to enjoy my content, and if you want to come along for
83960	88560	the ride, then you're more than welcome to join me on this lovely little road trip.
88560	93000	And many people have asked me to do a video on this chap, so it clearly does have an appeal,
93000	97160	and hopefully today I can provide a more impartial look at everything he's said and done, and
97160	99560	give some thoughts and opinions.
99560	100560	It's in the name.
100560	104640	Also, once again, I know this will be a late coverage of the topic, but I prefer to wait
104640	108500	until all the dust has settled before pulling out the duster, if you know what I mean.
108500	112760	It also allows me to have a look at what more can be said, rather than just observing the
112760	114640	current drama that is going down.
114640	119680	So let's briefly have a rundown of why Butch Hartman is of interest, because on the surface,
119680	124420	if you were just scrolling through his Wikipedia page, Butch Hartman has no right to be involved
124420	125940	in the YouTube community.
125940	129760	If you're an internet casual, like most people, you wouldn't be able to tell him apart from
129760	132260	any other TV producer or animator.
132260	137140	But as we're going to find out today, there's a lot to distinguish him beneath the surface.
137140	141860	So to people who are unfamiliar with this gentleman, Butch Hartman is a multi-talented
141860	146600	individual in children's cartoons, he has produced many popular TV shows, the one that
146600	151140	you lot are probably most conversant with is The Fairly Odd Parents, a show that I used
151140	152140	to adore growing up.
152140	156240	It's the sort of thing that, in spite of its rather ostentatious attitude, just has
156240	161080	the plots to really inspire the imagination with all these possibilities of a fantastical
161080	162480	world that it creates.
162480	166660	Given where I lived and the sort of TV service that we used to receive, I never really had
166660	171600	the opportunity to watch it on a regular basis, so any time I did was a real luxury.
171600	176120	However, that is merely a ripple in the ocean that is his career, and he has helped produce
176120	181440	many other children's television shows including Danny Phantom, Tough Puppy, and Dexter's
181440	185680	Laboratory, which although it's something that we wouldn't think about too much as kids,
185680	188440	it's easy to see the striking stylistic similarities.
188440	190480	Ooh, that was some nice alliteration.
190480	195160	Anyhow, before I become too caught up in my own language, let me make it clear, it's no
195160	199960	criticism that you have consistency in your animations, plenty of franchises have a lot
199960	204480	of overlap in their technique, if you can evolve storylines and characters in a compelling
204480	209800	fashion then having a formula for animation is merely an unchanging cog in a greater machine.
209800	213920	But anyway, Butch Hartman, through this signature flair, created a real following, typically
213920	218480	when you have something unique and defining like that is what happens, much alike to Doug
218480	222560	Walker, that whether you personally loved him or hated him, there was an undeniable
222560	224520	appeal to what he created.
224520	229520	He also really involved himself online, particularly using his Twitter, as means to create a relationship
229560	233760	with his fans, and often involving himself in many online trends and memes, leading to
233760	237760	the same interesting results, although they were mildly entertaining.
237760	242640	He'd also provide his daily dose of wisdom, which typically inspired people to go and,
242640	247880	well, retweet it, can't knock the impressions, but Hartman clearly made good impressions.
247880	249120	So why are we here today?
249120	253260	Well, there have been numerous controversies surrounding some of his recent projects and
253260	257400	also comments that he's made, people DM'd me and tweeted me about it, and eventually
257400	261820	after working on two other videos that I hope are out by now, I contacted one of these
261820	264080	people and said, hit me with your best shot.
264080	268840	It is only fair to credit them as they have provided me with an extensive backlog of information,
268840	270800	some of which I have used, some of which I have not.
270800	274200	Their Twitter page should be up on the screen right now, so feel free to follow them.
274200	276480	I'll also leave a link in the pinned comment.
276480	280880	I knew about a lot of these situations on the surface because I saw a lot of discourse,
280880	283240	and of course, any drama takes my interest.
283240	286960	However, it is important that you feel fully informed on what's happening before you make
286960	287960	such comments.
287960	292800	So without further ado, let's discuss everything that has inspired such a sudden turn on a
292800	295880	person, and ask ourselves what can be drawn from it.
295880	307280	Now it's hard to document this in a clear chronological order because a lot of things
307280	310200	were revealed at different times as to when they happened.
310200	314160	However, it all seemed to snowball when he created a Kickstarter for something known
314160	315160	as Oaxis.
315160	319440	You see, in February Butch Hartman announced that he had departed Nickelodeon.
319440	323640	The video was mostly him just fondly reflecting on his career with the company, with the notion
323640	325560	that he left because he felt it was time.
325560	330000	He had been working there 20 years, and as fun as something can be, sometimes you do
330000	333720	need a change, so nothing seemed particularly out of the ordinary here.
333720	338240	He made a lot of vague, open comments that kind of gave him the option to go anywhere,
338240	341200	while still remaining consistent with some sort of trajectory.
341200	345280	So June came around, and he finally decided to make a serious announcement, one that would
345280	350280	finally serve as a sufficient follow-on for his fans, as to where his work was going.
350280	351560	What was it, I hear you ask?
351560	353240	Well, it was his own network.
353240	358480	In a video titled I'm Starting a New Network, all in big, sexy capital letters, to really
358480	363560	give it that emphatic vibe, he announced that he was, believe it or not, starting a new
363560	364560	network.
364560	368200	Now this was presented as a competitor to all the other large networks, however there
368200	369480	was a spin.
369480	374320	He was going to be, in vain of many of the other recent initiatives, consumer-oriented.
374320	379480	He rightfully points out that a lot of corporations have no deeper relationship with their audience,
379480	382060	and says that he can present that himself.
382060	386520	This is followed by a very interesting advert, where he really talks about key values being
386520	391280	eroded away by modern life, and then presenting the network as the solution.
391280	394600	It was also announced that this was going to be a Kickstarter, with his initial goal
394600	397120	being set at $250,000.
397120	401040	This would cover the costs of producers, and aid the creation of family-friendly shows
401040	402920	about positive subject matters.
402920	415120	I have to admit, it is an intriguing initiative, in spite of the meme baits.
415120	419320	This initially reminded me of DeFranco's fundraising project to support his own independent
419320	423640	news network, and generally as long as someone's transparent with the distribution of such
423640	427280	funds then I don't think you can really complain, and although I think it is necessary
427280	430920	to talk about the worst things going on in the world, we can't constantly hide in the
430920	433640	bubble of pseudo-family positive values.
433640	438640	However, as a brief refuge for wholesome family time, it's not a bad idea, given the race
438640	442840	to the bottom of sensationalism that a lot of the media do tend to be participating in
442840	443840	currently.
443840	447360	So although there was a possible discussion to be had about the sort of values that Hartman
447360	451840	would be adopting, it was mostly calm at this point, but there is always calm before the
451840	452840	storm.
453040	457080	This is where it begins to become quite suspicious, after setting up the Kickstarter, he hit the
457080	461400	target surprisingly quickly, with a number of donors from certain locations.
461400	465540	Although it's completely reasonable to suggest that maybe he just had a devoted fanbase with
465540	469360	a few individuals who are fairly stacked, many felt there were some strings being pulled
469360	470720	behind the scenes.
470720	472360	Well why on earth would that be?
472360	476240	Well Hartman himself has always been fairly well intertwined with deep core Christian
476240	477240	values.
506240	522240	And let us be clear here, there is nothing wrong with having religious beliefs, if it
522240	526080	makes you a better person then more power to you for it, however in the video it is
526080	530340	fairly safe to say he does not present the network as a religious venture.
530340	535280	And as a donor I'd say knowing the endorsements and vested interests of a possible recipient
535320	538880	is key, and that he did actively omit it.
538880	544480	But is this active deception, or just a failure to disclose details that he deemed unnecessary?
544480	548800	Well that would depend on how much this religious agenda was involved in the platform, it shouldn't
548800	553080	have really come as a surprise to anyone that this was going to involve Christian values,
553080	557960	the idea that society is being eroded by media and there's a necessity to return to core
557960	560680	family principles is inherently religious.
560680	565040	Why were things like homosexuality for example absolutely abhorred by a lot of religious
565040	567580	figures, and still are to an extent?
567580	569740	Because they upset their social order.
569740	574100	Now the more modern approach is that there are more disruptive elements than homosexuality
574100	577500	and you can still have a warm, healthy family with that.
577500	582200	And threats like exposure to violence, explicit content and so on are more troublesome to
582200	585200	today's youth than what adults do with their sex life.
585200	589980	However you can still see where it is rooted, what Butch is presenting is just a more modern
589980	595020	version of Christian values, given how much he utilised the Christian community he probably
595020	599240	should have disclosed this, he knows that he also has a young fanbase of animators who
599240	603540	probably don't know that much history to put the dots together on what Butch's values
603540	604540	represent.
604540	607900	He's made it no secret that he's a devout Christian, but I still think it's worth
607900	612060	talking about, especially given how deeply associated it turned out to be.
612060	614100	So how deeply associated was it?
614100	619020	I mean in all the seminars he didn't necessarily present it as an exclusively Christian streaming
619060	623520	service, however it was clear from the advertisers, from the fundraisers, from the comments that
623520	627860	he made that he was trying to appeal to the Christian audience and I think this created
627860	632700	a justified concern within the more animation oriented fans, because the whole hook of this
632700	636980	network presented in the original YouTube video was that this was going to be a streaming
636980	639220	site that is oriented for the viewer.
639220	643680	Which on principle is a pretty good idea, however there were a unique set of circumstances
643680	647500	that makes this unassailable, and thus rather unfair to not include.
647500	652900	We're going to speak to them in parables, guys I am not picking TBN, this is not TBN,
652900	657900	this is not the church channel, it's not Golden Eagle Broadcasting or Daystar, God bless
657900	663900	those people, it's amazing, my stuff has got to be today, it's got to be hip, it's
663900	667900	got to be cool, it's got to reach the secular people.
667900	671900	If I put a Christian network out there, no problem, I've got Christians, that's cool,
671900	675900	but I'm missing the entire other spectrum of the world.
675900	680140	You see, he is directly trying to appeal to two demographics that are pretty diametrically
680140	681260	opposed to each other.
681260	685380	Now I'm not best friends with every animator and artist out there, but one thing that I
685380	689460	will tell you is that in that community there is a proportionally high population made up
689460	694720	by people who would be labelled by a fundamental Christian society as deviants, and many who
694720	698760	have had overwhelmingly negative experiences with Christian values.
698760	702260	How do you cater to people who want to impose them, while still catering to people who want
702260	703620	to oppose them?
703620	707700	Listen, maybe there is a way, maybe you can find a compromise that brings everyone together
707700	712500	regardless of their background, however you have to lay out how you're going to do that,
712500	714280	what values you're going to promote.
714280	718380	By omitting this information completely, it appears Hartman knew that this would create
718380	722100	a conflict, and instead of addressing it, he decided that it would be better to deceive
722100	725620	both parties into thinking that he could cater to both of them.
725620	729440	And maybe he could, but he shouldn't have had the hubris to think that he could deceive
729440	732940	them too, and that was one of the biggest mistakes he made.
732940	737820	Remember Hartman probably had a vision, and two core fanbases that he could appeal to,
737820	743740	and maybe he thought that it was for the greater good, but sometimes not everyone is going
743740	748340	to see your ends, and at the same time you have to acknowledge that your visions may
748340	750340	be wrong.
750340	761300	However let's talk about his little vision, shall we?
761300	766220	When I was speaking about Fusi, I referred to his fallacious appeal to celestial powers,
766220	771380	and I have to admit the last person I was expecting to compare Butch Hartman to was
771380	773420	Mr. Erekat here.
773420	778220	However like Erekat, Hartman is clearly under the impression that God has some greater plan
778220	781520	for him, and God brought him to this situation.
781520	785900	When things have worked out with the level of perseverance they have with Hartman, it
785900	791140	is easy to believe that a consistent level of motivation will continue to turn up results,
791140	795540	but many of us, particularly people who may be considering investment, need more faith
795540	796860	to turn up results.
796860	801420	Saying God's plan is all very well and good, but many people do not see it that way, and
801420	805980	this was well expressed in the many videos criticising him, and many incriminating clips
805980	810380	showing the conflict of demographics that he was attempting to appeal to behind the
810380	826620	others back.
826620	830460	So what do you do when others post videos that do seem to show a side of you that you
830460	831700	don't want them to see?
831700	836060	Well in many instances, it seems the response has been to take them down.
836060	840040	Generally what was incriminating about this particular appearance was that it was somewhere
840080	842680	called the Warnau Wealth Builder Conference.
842680	844700	This is based around Lance Warnau.
844700	850380	Now I'm not going to criticise the conferences you talk at, however, if something seems credible,
850380	851380	you have to address it.
851380	853200	What do I mean exactly?
853200	857520	Well many people pointed out that Lance Warnau has some interesting beliefs that fit in far
857520	860480	too nicely with Butch Hartman's little escapade.
860480	864840	You see there's this doctrine called the Seven Mountains, which, well, is a whole different
864840	866040	barrel of fish really.
866040	870480	It basically proposes that Christianity is losing its grip on modern culture, and proposes
870480	874480	techniques of working how to modernise its appeal while having the traditionalist grip
874480	876560	on the values that they view as moral.
876560	878560	However, here's where it becomes trippy.
878560	882620	You see here, good old Dr. Lance, the host of this convention, is the person who was
882620	886680	also very prominent in the creation of the Seven Mountain Theory.
886680	890640	One of the Seven Mountains is the arts and entertainment industry, and in Butch Hartman's
890640	894680	speech he gave, he makes some very suspicious comments that seem consistent with the dogma
894680	896920	the ideology seems to be supporting.
896920	900640	If you want a more in-depth look at all this, there's a very interesting document that
900640	904760	I'll leave in the description below which sets up a little more of the mere circumstantial
904760	905760	evidence.
905760	908480	So what people created now was a different story.
908480	912660	Butch not being an idiot, knows that if he presents this as a Christian network, no one
912660	917280	will support it, after all, do many people here ever watch openly Christian channels?
917280	921420	So many came to this conclusion that this was no longer a platform merely inspired by
921420	926800	Christian values, it was a Trojan Horse presented under the guise of family values, but actually
926800	932140	implicitly smuggling in Christian ideas, without any of the backers appeal or knowledge.
932140	936800	Which although certainly by no means a proven theory, does seem somewhat credible.
936800	940320	When presented with a lot of this footage, including footage of him with other seedy
940320	944340	Christian figures, it was swiftly removed, in fact there have been multiple allegations
944340	948820	of him removing content that incriminates him, which is obviously not a good look.
948820	953320	When confronted with evidence against you, you have a few options, you can accept it,
953320	957780	you can dispel it, you can deny it, but you sure as hell should not remove it, it only
957780	962120	implicates you further, and at the same time other people will just re-upload it.
962120	965920	And as soon as you remove one, people will begin downloading and saving content that
965920	968080	implies you have committed wrongdoings.
968080	972120	So eventually this just made him look worse, and many commentators rightfully called him
972120	976200	out, whether he wasn't thinking, or saw it as the only way to save his bacon, it was
976200	977760	a very poor decision.
977760	979820	And when he decided to respond…
1007760	1011720	That's one thing, but if someone doesn't do anything, and they wanna like, you know,
1011720	1014460	I don't know, criticise, then I have no time for them.
1016620	1017620	No time for them.
1021060	1026660	So the person that asked that question, whose name will not be mentioned, ever, by my lips,
1026660	1031760	I just wanna tell all people like that, as I get back to safety here, that if you guys
1031760	1034400	can't do it yourselves, you shouldn't criticise anybody else.
1034400	1035400	What was the question?
1035400	1037580	Was someone attacking his animation skills?
1037580	1041680	Was someone challenging the years that the veteran animator had under his belt?
1044680	1050080	Oh, in a way it may seem like a trivial moment, but it does imply a lot about how Butch responds
1050080	1051960	to these criticisms.
1051960	1056000	The only time you can ever appeal to such an authority is when the authority is relevant
1056000	1057000	to the question.
1057000	1060280	If someone came up to me and said, the shirt you're wearing doesn't match your jeans,
1060280	1064200	I can't turn around to them and say, well you're not a semi-famous commentator, so
1064200	1066140	I shan't listen to your opinions.
1066140	1067820	It doesn't make logical sense.
1067820	1072620	On top of that, in my opinion, it's always a bad argument to use, it's incredibly arrogant,
1072620	1077340	and although experience sometimes can aid credibility, it's not an argument in itself.
1077340	1080720	All in all though, it's kind of worrying that someone of Butch's age, and I would
1080720	1085200	hope wisdom, would make such a redundant point, and both these scenarios that seek to justify
1085200	1088220	a comment tell a rather worrying story about him.
1088220	1093080	Either he genuinely thinks that's a legitimate retort, or he does not.
1093080	1096440	Whatever he does, it means that he's going to have serious issues listening to those
1096440	1100340	who call his judgement into question, because not everyone's going to be an expert, but
1100340	1103860	people will still have valid points, like the ones we've discussed in this video.
1103860	1108020	I'm nowhere near as experienced in many of the areas that Butch has spent decades
1108020	1111860	specialising in, but it doesn't delegitimize any of the points that are being made.
1111860	1115700	However, if he's going to genuinely dismiss criticism like that, then there is no scope
1115700	1118060	on Oaxis, because it won't go away.
1118060	1122140	However, I feel he is smarter than that, and he's more over attempting to appeal to the
1122140	1126840	easily satisfied sect of his fans through reasoning that positions him above his critics,
1126840	1131080	which inspires the fact that it antagonises a lot of people, and emboldens his status
1131080	1136280	as this sort of messiah to his die-hard fans, the ones that he, as a creator, benefits of
1136280	1137280	the most.
1137280	1141600	Either he views himself as a messiah which is a recipe for disaster, or he wants to benefit
1141600	1145520	off those who view him as a messiah, which is honestly worse.
1145520	1147360	Delusion or deception.
1147360	1152120	Even if his judgement was better, he has to sell that to people, and he seems so disinterested
1152120	1156440	that the critics keep coming back, and they were working harder to convince people that
1156440	1159600	he was wrong, that he was to convince them he was right.
1159600	1160660	There was no escape.
1160660	1163860	There were a couple other scandals that I haven't discussed, not because they're not
1163860	1167460	worth discussing, but mainly because they're kind of more independent to what we're talking
1167460	1168460	about today.
1168460	1172200	However, they definitely contributed to the shift in perception, from this well-liked
1172200	1176920	inspiring animator, to this rather suspect shady character who favoured his own visions
1176920	1181840	over the well-being of his supporters, and as the pressure finally piled on, he responded
1181840	1186800	more gracefully.
1186800	1191160	So bearing in mind that this criticism has been layering on pretty badly, Hartman had
1191160	1196200	no other option than to address the highly justified suspicions surrounding this channel
1196200	1199520	and the related ventures that he might be pursuing.
1199520	1203460	It may have occurred to him that these undertakings are in jeopardy, or maybe he just thought
1203460	1207980	a more in-depth reply would shut up the detractors, or maybe he genuinely wanted to clear the
1207980	1208980	air.
1208980	1209980	So he posted this letter.
1209980	1215060	The letter itself is eloquent, and in a way, it does really all it can do, decline the
1215060	1216060	claims.
1216060	1220660	He can't deny the conventions he spoke at, he can't deny the way he behaved, and he
1220660	1225140	can't deny any of the mishaps that occurred, however, he can deny the further conclusions
1225140	1228980	that many people claim about a possible agenda, because that is theoretical.
1228980	1233340	I'll leave a link in the description for you lads to go and read it and judge for yourself,
1233340	1238060	but as responses go, it's fairly rudimentary, nothing to write home about.
1238060	1241720	Nothing you would throw him in too deep for either, though I always feel like starting
1241720	1245860	off by sending love when you're in the depth of scandal is a rather contrived move, check
1245860	1249140	out my Greg Paul video explaining why exactly that is.
1249140	1252060	Best to save the pleasantries until after you've dealt with the allegations.
1252060	1257300	That's just a pet peeve in this instance though, it's not exactly the same situation.
1257300	1260020	What do I think this says about the greatest situation?
1260020	1264020	So in my opinion, there are two plausible scenarios with this little charade.
1264020	1267740	Because something's happening, it's just hard to necessarily label what degree it's happening
1267740	1268740	to.
1268740	1273100	On the one hand, Butch Hartman's idea of Oaxis was merely an innocent-minded venture with
1273100	1275260	Butch's values at the heart.
1275260	1279540	Now Butch makes it no secret that his religious roots are highly influential on his values,
1279540	1283220	and with this in mind, he thought he'd be able to reach his monetary targets by appealing
1283220	1285180	to church associations as well.
1285180	1288980	However, he didn't think that many people would care, or knew people would care, and
1288980	1291020	decided to try and keep the appeal separate.
1291020	1295520	This was a poor decision, as when you're making content that is being marketed and catered
1295520	1300100	to the audience, if a significant proportion of the audience is Christians who may perhaps
1300100	1304500	lean more fundamentally, then it doesn't matter which values you may have, because they might
1304500	1307600	have values that clash with your more artistic supporters.
1307600	1312140	And that's the thing, even with the most modest intentions, Butch has made a clear error,
1312140	1316020	because the donors could really affect the direction the platform moves in, he had to
1316020	1321020	disclose that, and failing to has really galvanised the wave of criticism against him.
1321020	1322800	That's his own fault unfortunately.
1322800	1326180	With regards to the more advanced theories, they do line up well.
1326180	1330740	Although it is possible that it is coincidental, his response of pulling footage that implicated
1330740	1335640	him was unbelievably myopic, and only made the idea that this was some sort of conspiracy
1335640	1336640	more credible.
1336640	1340680	Whether it was a conspiracy or not, I feel rather confident saying that it would have
1340680	1341680	failed.
1341680	1345860	Even if you try and insert subliminal messages, it still means sacrificing part of the appeal
1345860	1346940	of modern media.
1346940	1351020	I'm hard pressed to honestly believe that he genuinely thought that such a plan could
1351020	1355940	exert Christianity onto modern culture, it seems so ridiculous that I'm almost inclined
1355940	1357820	to give him the benefit of the doubt.
1357820	1362100	But on the other hand, if someone is motivated by a cause, especially ones that appeal to
1362100	1367380	a higher power like religion, it can often override a lot of logical reasoning.
1367380	1372040	Celestial beings do not need justification because they transcend existence, which is
1372040	1373640	why I'm always sceptical.
1373640	1377780	Though I'd hope that with his experience, Hartman would be able to recognise such ideas
1377780	1379000	as lost causes.
1379000	1383520	However, if I gave Fousey shit for his approach, Butch Hartman doesn't get a pass just because
1383520	1387600	he speaks with more authority or wisdom than our good mate Yusuf.
1387600	1391920	Hartman not only behaved childishly himself, he promoted a way of thinking that is designed
1391920	1395880	to push people who challenged him down, and telling those to trust him because of his
1395880	1397160	accolades.
1397160	1401080	Let me tell you something, the moment that you decide to trust authority because of the
1401080	1405000	fact that it is authority, is the moment that someone will seek to take advantage of
1405000	1406000	that authority.
1406000	1410200	And on the internet, we're more aware of that than ever, and many people clearly felt that
1410200	1413020	they were being justifiably taken advantage of.
1413020	1418240	And whether Hartman had greater plans or not, he was still asking people to trust his judgement,
1418240	1422780	and it would just turn out fine, even with the vague language and the lack of details
1422780	1424160	that he provided.
1424160	1425160	No.
1425160	1429600	All it takes is one bad actor to fuck that up, and people were right to expect more,
1429600	1432240	and he paid the price for not delivering it.
1432240	1436480	However, plenty of people aren't that skeptical, and plenty of people will continue to look
1436480	1442120	up to him, so he really needs to harness that responsibility, he has to try and hold himself
1442120	1445560	accountable, because he can't guarantee that we always will.
1445560	1448200	Anyhow, what do you think about Butch Hartman?
1448200	1451480	Let me know in the comments down below, I will do my best to reply to them in the first
1451480	1456480	few hours, though I am really busy at time recording, and a lot is happening in my life.
1456480	1461040	I would love to give a huge shoutout to the editors who have done another stellar job,
1461040	1465000	I'm gonna leave their links in the pinned comment, if you could check them out, it would
1465000	1469560	be fantastic, without them, this channel would not be where it is, I know I say that a lot,
1469560	1474560	but it really does make a huge difference in my life, and I can't show my appreciation
1474560	1475560	enough to them.
1475560	1479200	Also, if you wanna talk to me, and I'm not replying to comments, then you can hit me
1479200	1484040	up on Twitter, at the right opinion, hit me up on Facebook, I'll leave links to all those
1484040	1487760	in the description below, and I also have a Discord that I should be using more regularly
1487760	1488760	now I'm back at university.
1488760	1493280	Anyhow, I don't think I have too much else to say, once again, thanks for the support
1493280	1498920	of recent, I hope everyone's having a wonderful day, and continues to have a wonderful day,
1498920	1502720	or maybe the day is coming to an end, and I hope you've had a wonderful day.
1502720	1507280	But until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
1514040	1527720	I'll see you in the next one.
