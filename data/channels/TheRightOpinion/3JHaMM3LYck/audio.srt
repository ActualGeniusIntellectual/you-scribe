00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,060
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,140
too much free time, and I have a thoroughly diverse audience.

3
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,440
And in a way that some would expect, but because I'm so integrated with many commentators

4
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,840
I can occasionally lose sight of this, despite the fact that I know I have people who don't

5
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,800
even follow what's going on with people like Fouseytube, despite it being spoken about

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,680
non-stop in my circles.

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,600
In fact, I clearly have a significant amount of people who are more interested in today's

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,120
topic, which is also interesting to me, because although admittedly I am fairly familiar with

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,720
the individual in question, it kind of falls outside the typical content that I would turn

10
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,720
to.

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,480
However, with that said, my Doug Walker video did very well, and that was, in a way, in

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,600
the same vein, so I only think it's justified to discuss this person, who once again, some

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,920
of you will be very familiar with, and some of you will probably have never heard of.

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,220
Some of you might be big fans of him, others may despise him.

15
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:11,060
One thing I know is that these less commentary, more niche topics provoke strong feelings

16
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,400
within individuals, to the point where they may yield rather strong opinions.

17
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,840
So I don't expect this to go down fantastically with everyone, but I don't do it to please

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,840
everyone.

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,960
I do it for the people who want to enjoy my content, and if you want to come along for

20
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,560
the ride, then you're more than welcome to join me on this lovely little road trip.

21
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,000
And many people have asked me to do a video on this chap, so it clearly does have an appeal,

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,160
and hopefully today I can provide a more impartial look at everything he's said and done, and

23
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,560
give some thoughts and opinions.

24
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,560
It's in the name.

25
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,640
Also, once again, I know this will be a late coverage of the topic, but I prefer to wait

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,500
until all the dust has settled before pulling out the duster, if you know what I mean.

27
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,760
It also allows me to have a look at what more can be said, rather than just observing the

28
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,640
current drama that is going down.

29
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,680
So let's briefly have a rundown of why Butch Hartman is of interest, because on the surface,

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,420
if you were just scrolling through his Wikipedia page, Butch Hartman has no right to be involved

31
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,940
in the YouTube community.

32
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,760
If you're an internet casual, like most people, you wouldn't be able to tell him apart from

33
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,260
any other TV producer or animator.

34
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,140
But as we're going to find out today, there's a lot to distinguish him beneath the surface.

35
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,860
So to people who are unfamiliar with this gentleman, Butch Hartman is a multi-talented

36
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,600
individual in children's cartoons, he has produced many popular TV shows, the one that

37
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,140
you lot are probably most conversant with is The Fairly Odd Parents, a show that I used

38
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,140
to adore growing up.

39
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,240
It's the sort of thing that, in spite of its rather ostentatious attitude, just has

40
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,080
the plots to really inspire the imagination with all these possibilities of a fantastical

41
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,480
world that it creates.

42
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,660
Given where I lived and the sort of TV service that we used to receive, I never really had

43
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,600
the opportunity to watch it on a regular basis, so any time I did was a real luxury.

44
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,120
However, that is merely a ripple in the ocean that is his career, and he has helped produce

45
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,440
many other children's television shows including Danny Phantom, Tough Puppy, and Dexter's

46
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,680
Laboratory, which although it's something that we wouldn't think about too much as kids,

47
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,440
it's easy to see the striking stylistic similarities.

48
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,480
Ooh, that was some nice alliteration.

49
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,160
Anyhow, before I become too caught up in my own language, let me make it clear, it's no

50
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,960
criticism that you have consistency in your animations, plenty of franchises have a lot

51
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,480
of overlap in their technique, if you can evolve storylines and characters in a compelling

52
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,800
fashion then having a formula for animation is merely an unchanging cog in a greater machine.

53
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,920
But anyway, Butch Hartman, through this signature flair, created a real following, typically

54
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,480
when you have something unique and defining like that is what happens, much alike to Doug

55
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,560
Walker, that whether you personally loved him or hated him, there was an undeniable

56
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,520
appeal to what he created.

57
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,520
He also really involved himself online, particularly using his Twitter, as means to create a relationship

58
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,760
with his fans, and often involving himself in many online trends and memes, leading to

59
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,760
the same interesting results, although they were mildly entertaining.

60
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,640
He'd also provide his daily dose of wisdom, which typically inspired people to go and,

61
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,880
well, retweet it, can't knock the impressions, but Hartman clearly made good impressions.

62
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,120
So why are we here today?

63
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,260
Well, there have been numerous controversies surrounding some of his recent projects and

64
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,400
also comments that he's made, people DM'd me and tweeted me about it, and eventually

65
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,820
after working on two other videos that I hope are out by now, I contacted one of these

66
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,080
people and said, hit me with your best shot.

67
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,840
It is only fair to credit them as they have provided me with an extensive backlog of information,

68
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,800
some of which I have used, some of which I have not.

69
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,200
Their Twitter page should be up on the screen right now, so feel free to follow them.

70
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,480
I'll also leave a link in the pinned comment.

71
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,880
I knew about a lot of these situations on the surface because I saw a lot of discourse,

72
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,240
and of course, any drama takes my interest.

73
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,960
However, it is important that you feel fully informed on what's happening before you make

74
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,960
such comments.

75
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,800
So without further ado, let's discuss everything that has inspired such a sudden turn on a

76
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,880
person, and ask ourselves what can be drawn from it.

77
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:07,280
Now it's hard to document this in a clear chronological order because a lot of things

78
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,200
were revealed at different times as to when they happened.

79
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,160
However, it all seemed to snowball when he created a Kickstarter for something known

80
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
as Oaxis.

81
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,440
You see, in February Butch Hartman announced that he had departed Nickelodeon.

82
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,640
The video was mostly him just fondly reflecting on his career with the company, with the notion

83
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,560
that he left because he felt it was time.

84
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,000
He had been working there 20 years, and as fun as something can be, sometimes you do

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,720
need a change, so nothing seemed particularly out of the ordinary here.

86
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,240
He made a lot of vague, open comments that kind of gave him the option to go anywhere,

87
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,200
while still remaining consistent with some sort of trajectory.

88
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,280
So June came around, and he finally decided to make a serious announcement, one that would

89
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,280
finally serve as a sufficient follow-on for his fans, as to where his work was going.

90
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,560
What was it, I hear you ask?

91
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,240
Well, it was his own network.

92
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,480
In a video titled I'm Starting a New Network, all in big, sexy capital letters, to really

93
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,560
give it that emphatic vibe, he announced that he was, believe it or not, starting a new

94
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,560
network.

95
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,200
Now this was presented as a competitor to all the other large networks, however there

96
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,480
was a spin.

97
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,320
He was going to be, in vain of many of the other recent initiatives, consumer-oriented.

98
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,480
He rightfully points out that a lot of corporations have no deeper relationship with their audience,

99
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,060
and says that he can present that himself.

100
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,520
This is followed by a very interesting advert, where he really talks about key values being

101
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,280
eroded away by modern life, and then presenting the network as the solution.

102
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,600
It was also announced that this was going to be a Kickstarter, with his initial goal

103
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,120
being set at $250,000.

104
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,040
This would cover the costs of producers, and aid the creation of family-friendly shows

105
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,920
about positive subject matters.

106
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:55,120
I have to admit, it is an intriguing initiative, in spite of the meme baits.

107
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,320
This initially reminded me of DeFranco's fundraising project to support his own independent

108
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,640
news network, and generally as long as someone's transparent with the distribution of such

109
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,280
funds then I don't think you can really complain, and although I think it is necessary

110
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,920
to talk about the worst things going on in the world, we can't constantly hide in the

111
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,640
bubble of pseudo-family positive values.

112
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,640
However, as a brief refuge for wholesome family time, it's not a bad idea, given the race

113
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,840
to the bottom of sensationalism that a lot of the media do tend to be participating in

114
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
currently.

115
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,360
So although there was a possible discussion to be had about the sort of values that Hartman

116
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,840
would be adopting, it was mostly calm at this point, but there is always calm before the

117
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,840
storm.

118
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,080
This is where it begins to become quite suspicious, after setting up the Kickstarter, he hit the

119
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,400
target surprisingly quickly, with a number of donors from certain locations.

120
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,540
Although it's completely reasonable to suggest that maybe he just had a devoted fanbase with

121
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,360
a few individuals who are fairly stacked, many felt there were some strings being pulled

122
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,720
behind the scenes.

123
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,360
Well why on earth would that be?

124
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,240
Well Hartman himself has always been fairly well intertwined with deep core Christian

125
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,240
values.

126
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:42,240
And let us be clear here, there is nothing wrong with having religious beliefs, if it

127
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,080
makes you a better person then more power to you for it, however in the video it is

128
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,340
fairly safe to say he does not present the network as a religious venture.

129
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:55,280
And as a donor I'd say knowing the endorsements and vested interests of a possible recipient

130
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,880
is key, and that he did actively omit it.

131
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,480
But is this active deception, or just a failure to disclose details that he deemed unnecessary?

132
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,800
Well that would depend on how much this religious agenda was involved in the platform, it shouldn't

133
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,080
have really come as a surprise to anyone that this was going to involve Christian values,

134
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,960
the idea that society is being eroded by media and there's a necessity to return to core

135
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,680
family principles is inherently religious.

136
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,040
Why were things like homosexuality for example absolutely abhorred by a lot of religious

137
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,580
figures, and still are to an extent?

138
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,740
Because they upset their social order.

139
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:34,100
Now the more modern approach is that there are more disruptive elements than homosexuality

140
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,500
and you can still have a warm, healthy family with that.

141
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,200
And threats like exposure to violence, explicit content and so on are more troublesome to

142
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,200
today's youth than what adults do with their sex life.

143
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,980
However you can still see where it is rooted, what Butch is presenting is just a more modern

144
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,020
version of Christian values, given how much he utilised the Christian community he probably

145
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,240
should have disclosed this, he knows that he also has a young fanbase of animators who

146
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,540
probably don't know that much history to put the dots together on what Butch's values

147
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,540
represent.

148
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,900
He's made it no secret that he's a devout Christian, but I still think it's worth

149
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,060
talking about, especially given how deeply associated it turned out to be.

150
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,100
So how deeply associated was it?

151
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,020
I mean in all the seminars he didn't necessarily present it as an exclusively Christian streaming

152
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:23,520
service, however it was clear from the advertisers, from the fundraisers, from the comments that

153
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,860
he made that he was trying to appeal to the Christian audience and I think this created

154
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,700
a justified concern within the more animation oriented fans, because the whole hook of this

155
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,980
network presented in the original YouTube video was that this was going to be a streaming

156
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,220
site that is oriented for the viewer.

157
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,680
Which on principle is a pretty good idea, however there were a unique set of circumstances

158
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,500
that makes this unassailable, and thus rather unfair to not include.

159
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,900
We're going to speak to them in parables, guys I am not picking TBN, this is not TBN,

160
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,900
this is not the church channel, it's not Golden Eagle Broadcasting or Daystar, God bless

161
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:03,900
those people, it's amazing, my stuff has got to be today, it's got to be hip, it's

162
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,900
got to be cool, it's got to reach the secular people.

163
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,900
If I put a Christian network out there, no problem, I've got Christians, that's cool,

164
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,900
but I'm missing the entire other spectrum of the world.

165
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,140
You see, he is directly trying to appeal to two demographics that are pretty diametrically

166
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,260
opposed to each other.

167
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:25,380
Now I'm not best friends with every animator and artist out there, but one thing that I

168
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,460
will tell you is that in that community there is a proportionally high population made up

169
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:34,720
by people who would be labelled by a fundamental Christian society as deviants, and many who

170
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,760
have had overwhelmingly negative experiences with Christian values.

171
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,260
How do you cater to people who want to impose them, while still catering to people who want

172
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,620
to oppose them?

173
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,700
Listen, maybe there is a way, maybe you can find a compromise that brings everyone together

174
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,500
regardless of their background, however you have to lay out how you're going to do that,

175
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,280
what values you're going to promote.

176
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,380
By omitting this information completely, it appears Hartman knew that this would create

177
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,100
a conflict, and instead of addressing it, he decided that it would be better to deceive

178
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,620
both parties into thinking that he could cater to both of them.

179
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,440
And maybe he could, but he shouldn't have had the hubris to think that he could deceive

180
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,940
them too, and that was one of the biggest mistakes he made.

181
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,820
Remember Hartman probably had a vision, and two core fanbases that he could appeal to,

182
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:23,740
and maybe he thought that it was for the greater good, but sometimes not everyone is going

183
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:28,340
to see your ends, and at the same time you have to acknowledge that your visions may

184
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,340
be wrong.

185
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:41,300
However let's talk about his little vision, shall we?

186
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:46,220
When I was speaking about Fusi, I referred to his fallacious appeal to celestial powers,

187
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:51,380
and I have to admit the last person I was expecting to compare Butch Hartman to was

188
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,420
Mr. Erekat here.

189
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:58,220
However like Erekat, Hartman is clearly under the impression that God has some greater plan

190
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,520
for him, and God brought him to this situation.

191
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,900
When things have worked out with the level of perseverance they have with Hartman, it

192
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:11,140
is easy to believe that a consistent level of motivation will continue to turn up results,

193
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,540
but many of us, particularly people who may be considering investment, need more faith

194
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,860
to turn up results.

195
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,420
Saying God's plan is all very well and good, but many people do not see it that way, and

196
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,980
this was well expressed in the many videos criticising him, and many incriminating clips

197
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,380
showing the conflict of demographics that he was attempting to appeal to behind the

198
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:46,620
others back.

199
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,460
So what do you do when others post videos that do seem to show a side of you that you

200
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,700
don't want them to see?

201
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,060
Well in many instances, it seems the response has been to take them down.

202
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,040
Generally what was incriminating about this particular appearance was that it was somewhere

203
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,680
called the Warnau Wealth Builder Conference.

204
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,700
This is based around Lance Warnau.

205
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:10,380
Now I'm not going to criticise the conferences you talk at, however, if something seems credible,

206
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,380
you have to address it.

207
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,200
What do I mean exactly?

208
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,520
Well many people pointed out that Lance Warnau has some interesting beliefs that fit in far

209
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,480
too nicely with Butch Hartman's little escapade.

210
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,840
You see there's this doctrine called the Seven Mountains, which, well, is a whole different

211
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,040
barrel of fish really.

212
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,480
It basically proposes that Christianity is losing its grip on modern culture, and proposes

213
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,480
techniques of working how to modernise its appeal while having the traditionalist grip

214
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,560
on the values that they view as moral.

215
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,560
However, here's where it becomes trippy.

216
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,620
You see here, good old Dr. Lance, the host of this convention, is the person who was

217
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,680
also very prominent in the creation of the Seven Mountain Theory.

218
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,640
One of the Seven Mountains is the arts and entertainment industry, and in Butch Hartman's

219
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,680
speech he gave, he makes some very suspicious comments that seem consistent with the dogma

220
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,920
the ideology seems to be supporting.

221
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,640
If you want a more in-depth look at all this, there's a very interesting document that

222
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,760
I'll leave in the description below which sets up a little more of the mere circumstantial

223
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,760
evidence.

224
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,480
So what people created now was a different story.

225
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,660
Butch not being an idiot, knows that if he presents this as a Christian network, no one

226
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:17,280
will support it, after all, do many people here ever watch openly Christian channels?

227
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,420
So many came to this conclusion that this was no longer a platform merely inspired by

228
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,800
Christian values, it was a Trojan Horse presented under the guise of family values, but actually

229
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,140
implicitly smuggling in Christian ideas, without any of the backers appeal or knowledge.

230
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:36,800
Which although certainly by no means a proven theory, does seem somewhat credible.

231
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,320
When presented with a lot of this footage, including footage of him with other seedy

232
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,340
Christian figures, it was swiftly removed, in fact there have been multiple allegations

233
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:48,820
of him removing content that incriminates him, which is obviously not a good look.

234
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:53,320
When confronted with evidence against you, you have a few options, you can accept it,

235
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,780
you can dispel it, you can deny it, but you sure as hell should not remove it, it only

236
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:02,120
implicates you further, and at the same time other people will just re-upload it.

237
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,920
And as soon as you remove one, people will begin downloading and saving content that

238
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,080
implies you have committed wrongdoings.

239
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,120
So eventually this just made him look worse, and many commentators rightfully called him

240
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,200
out, whether he wasn't thinking, or saw it as the only way to save his bacon, it was

241
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,760
a very poor decision.

242
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,820
And when he decided to respond…

243
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,720
That's one thing, but if someone doesn't do anything, and they wanna like, you know,

244
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,460
I don't know, criticise, then I have no time for them.

245
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,620
No time for them.

246
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:06,660
So the person that asked that question, whose name will not be mentioned, ever, by my lips,

247
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,760
I just wanna tell all people like that, as I get back to safety here, that if you guys

248
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,400
can't do it yourselves, you shouldn't criticise anybody else.

249
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,400
What was the question?

250
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,580
Was someone attacking his animation skills?

251
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:21,680
Was someone challenging the years that the veteran animator had under his belt?

252
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:30,080
Oh, in a way it may seem like a trivial moment, but it does imply a lot about how Butch responds

253
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,960
to these criticisms.

254
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,000
The only time you can ever appeal to such an authority is when the authority is relevant

255
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
to the question.

256
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,280
If someone came up to me and said, the shirt you're wearing doesn't match your jeans,

257
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,200
I can't turn around to them and say, well you're not a semi-famous commentator, so

258
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,140
I shan't listen to your opinions.

259
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,820
It doesn't make logical sense.

260
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:52,620
On top of that, in my opinion, it's always a bad argument to use, it's incredibly arrogant,

261
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,340
and although experience sometimes can aid credibility, it's not an argument in itself.

262
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,720
All in all though, it's kind of worrying that someone of Butch's age, and I would

263
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,200
hope wisdom, would make such a redundant point, and both these scenarios that seek to justify

264
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,220
a comment tell a rather worrying story about him.

265
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:13,080
Either he genuinely thinks that's a legitimate retort, or he does not.

266
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,440
Whatever he does, it means that he's going to have serious issues listening to those

267
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,340
who call his judgement into question, because not everyone's going to be an expert, but

268
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,860
people will still have valid points, like the ones we've discussed in this video.

269
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:28,020
I'm nowhere near as experienced in many of the areas that Butch has spent decades

270
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,860
specialising in, but it doesn't delegitimize any of the points that are being made.

271
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,700
However, if he's going to genuinely dismiss criticism like that, then there is no scope

272
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,060
on Oaxis, because it won't go away.

273
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:42,140
However, I feel he is smarter than that, and he's more over attempting to appeal to the

274
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,840
easily satisfied sect of his fans through reasoning that positions him above his critics,

275
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,080
which inspires the fact that it antagonises a lot of people, and emboldens his status

276
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,280
as this sort of messiah to his die-hard fans, the ones that he, as a creator, benefits of

277
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,280
the most.

278
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,600
Either he views himself as a messiah which is a recipe for disaster, or he wants to benefit

279
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,520
off those who view him as a messiah, which is honestly worse.

280
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,360
Delusion or deception.

281
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,120
Even if his judgement was better, he has to sell that to people, and he seems so disinterested

282
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,440
that the critics keep coming back, and they were working harder to convince people that

283
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,600
he was wrong, that he was to convince them he was right.

284
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,660
There was no escape.

285
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,860
There were a couple other scandals that I haven't discussed, not because they're not

286
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,460
worth discussing, but mainly because they're kind of more independent to what we're talking

287
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,460
about today.

288
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,200
However, they definitely contributed to the shift in perception, from this well-liked

289
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,920
inspiring animator, to this rather suspect shady character who favoured his own visions

290
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,840
over the well-being of his supporters, and as the pressure finally piled on, he responded

291
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,800
more gracefully.

292
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,160
So bearing in mind that this criticism has been layering on pretty badly, Hartman had

293
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:56,200
no other option than to address the highly justified suspicions surrounding this channel

294
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,520
and the related ventures that he might be pursuing.

295
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,460
It may have occurred to him that these undertakings are in jeopardy, or maybe he just thought

296
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,980
a more in-depth reply would shut up the detractors, or maybe he genuinely wanted to clear the

297
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,980
air.

298
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,980
So he posted this letter.

299
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:15,060
The letter itself is eloquent, and in a way, it does really all it can do, decline the

300
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,060
claims.

301
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,660
He can't deny the conventions he spoke at, he can't deny the way he behaved, and he

302
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:25,140
can't deny any of the mishaps that occurred, however, he can deny the further conclusions

303
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,980
that many people claim about a possible agenda, because that is theoretical.

304
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,340
I'll leave a link in the description for you lads to go and read it and judge for yourself,

305
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:38,060
but as responses go, it's fairly rudimentary, nothing to write home about.

306
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,720
Nothing you would throw him in too deep for either, though I always feel like starting

307
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,860
off by sending love when you're in the depth of scandal is a rather contrived move, check

308
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,140
out my Greg Paul video explaining why exactly that is.

309
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,060
Best to save the pleasantries until after you've dealt with the allegations.

310
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:57,300
That's just a pet peeve in this instance though, it's not exactly the same situation.

311
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,020
What do I think this says about the greatest situation?

312
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:04,020
So in my opinion, there are two plausible scenarios with this little charade.

313
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,740
Because something's happening, it's just hard to necessarily label what degree it's happening

314
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,740
to.

315
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:13,100
On the one hand, Butch Hartman's idea of Oaxis was merely an innocent-minded venture with

316
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,260
Butch's values at the heart.

317
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:19,540
Now Butch makes it no secret that his religious roots are highly influential on his values,

318
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,220
and with this in mind, he thought he'd be able to reach his monetary targets by appealing

319
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,180
to church associations as well.

320
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:28,980
However, he didn't think that many people would care, or knew people would care, and

321
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,020
decided to try and keep the appeal separate.

322
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:35,520
This was a poor decision, as when you're making content that is being marketed and catered

323
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,100
to the audience, if a significant proportion of the audience is Christians who may perhaps

324
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,500
lean more fundamentally, then it doesn't matter which values you may have, because they might

325
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,600
have values that clash with your more artistic supporters.

326
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,140
And that's the thing, even with the most modest intentions, Butch has made a clear error,

327
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,020
because the donors could really affect the direction the platform moves in, he had to

328
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:01,020
disclose that, and failing to has really galvanised the wave of criticism against him.

329
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,800
That's his own fault unfortunately.

330
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,180
With regards to the more advanced theories, they do line up well.

331
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:10,740
Although it is possible that it is coincidental, his response of pulling footage that implicated

332
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,640
him was unbelievably myopic, and only made the idea that this was some sort of conspiracy

333
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,640
more credible.

334
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,680
Whether it was a conspiracy or not, I feel rather confident saying that it would have

335
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,680
failed.

336
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,860
Even if you try and insert subliminal messages, it still means sacrificing part of the appeal

337
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,940
of modern media.

338
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,020
I'm hard pressed to honestly believe that he genuinely thought that such a plan could

339
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:35,940
exert Christianity onto modern culture, it seems so ridiculous that I'm almost inclined

340
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,820
to give him the benefit of the doubt.

341
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:42,100
But on the other hand, if someone is motivated by a cause, especially ones that appeal to

342
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:47,380
a higher power like religion, it can often override a lot of logical reasoning.

343
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:52,040
Celestial beings do not need justification because they transcend existence, which is

344
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,640
why I'm always sceptical.

345
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,780
Though I'd hope that with his experience, Hartman would be able to recognise such ideas

346
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,000
as lost causes.

347
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,520
However, if I gave Fousey shit for his approach, Butch Hartman doesn't get a pass just because

348
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,600
he speaks with more authority or wisdom than our good mate Yusuf.

349
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,920
Hartman not only behaved childishly himself, he promoted a way of thinking that is designed

350
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,880
to push people who challenged him down, and telling those to trust him because of his

351
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,160
accolades.

352
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,080
Let me tell you something, the moment that you decide to trust authority because of the

353
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,000
fact that it is authority, is the moment that someone will seek to take advantage of

354
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
that authority.

355
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,200
And on the internet, we're more aware of that than ever, and many people clearly felt that

356
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,020
they were being justifiably taken advantage of.

357
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:38,240
And whether Hartman had greater plans or not, he was still asking people to trust his judgement,

358
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,780
and it would just turn out fine, even with the vague language and the lack of details

359
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,160
that he provided.

360
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
No.

361
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,600
All it takes is one bad actor to fuck that up, and people were right to expect more,

362
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,240
and he paid the price for not delivering it.

363
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,480
However, plenty of people aren't that skeptical, and plenty of people will continue to look

364
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,120
up to him, so he really needs to harness that responsibility, he has to try and hold himself

365
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,560
accountable, because he can't guarantee that we always will.

366
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,200
Anyhow, what do you think about Butch Hartman?

367
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,480
Let me know in the comments down below, I will do my best to reply to them in the first

368
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,480
few hours, though I am really busy at time recording, and a lot is happening in my life.

369
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,040
I would love to give a huge shoutout to the editors who have done another stellar job,

370
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm gonna leave their links in the pinned comment, if you could check them out, it would

371
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,560
be fantastic, without them, this channel would not be where it is, I know I say that a lot,

372
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:34,560
but it really does make a huge difference in my life, and I can't show my appreciation

373
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,560
enough to them.

374
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:39,200
Also, if you wanna talk to me, and I'm not replying to comments, then you can hit me

375
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,040
up on Twitter, at the right opinion, hit me up on Facebook, I'll leave links to all those

376
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,760
in the description below, and I also have a Discord that I should be using more regularly

377
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,760
now I'm back at university.

378
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,280
Anyhow, I don't think I have too much else to say, once again, thanks for the support

379
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:58,920
of recent, I hope everyone's having a wonderful day, and continues to have a wonderful day,

380
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,720
or maybe the day is coming to an end, and I hope you've had a wonderful day.

381
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,280
But until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

382
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:27,720
I'll see you in the next one.
