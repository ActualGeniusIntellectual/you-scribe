0	11000	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,
11000	16000	and care, something that I would argue is very important in YouTube videos.
16000	22000	My content has been a long journey from 2016, where I would rant about domestic UK politics in figures
22000	25000	who most people in this video probably wouldn't even know in the slightest.
25000	31000	And now we're here, where I make long-form videos on drama and conflicts, and the sorts of mentalities that lie behind them.
31000	36000	However, one thing has never changed, the fact that I do care deeply about the topics I discuss.
36000	41000	Every now and then, I get the comment about how I've changed from what I used to do, and honestly, I have,
41000	44000	and it has brought me considerable success over previous topics of interest.
44000	49000	But honestly, if I wasn't interested in the topics that I spoke about, if I wasn't invested in it,
49000	55000	if I didn't think I had something to say, then I probably wouldn't have the tolerance to talk about it for half an hour in multiple videos.
55000	59000	Make no mistake, you don't have to like my videos, but I do care about them.
59000	63000	And that's the thing, I've always loved talking, in case you don't have that impression already.
63000	69000	I love hearing opinions too, and honestly, if I don't have an opinion on something, it probably means I just haven't had the time to look into it.
69000	75000	I've always loved looking up things and establishing what I actually feel about it, and then communicating it to a greater audience.
76000	80000	I've always argued that it is important to care about the content that you're actually making.
80000	85000	I obviously can't sit here and look into the mind of every single person that I'm analysing in my videos,
85000	91000	which is why I don't tend to state intent, but I obviously have my own opinions on why I feel some people make their videos.
91000	95000	But it would be such a level of conjecture that I seldom include that speculation.
95000	99000	Personally, it's always safe to decide on the benefit of the doubt when making videos about people's intent,
99000	103000	because I think a false negative is much more harmful than a false positive.
103000	110000	If people take the assumption that a person is good, then that may still have grounds to be changed in the future if that person behaves out of order more obviously.
110000	117000	However, if the community assumes a person is bad, then I do think it gives the person a tougher job to grind out a redemption arc.
117000	122000	Nonetheless, when someone behaves in a way that I do feel underlines a much deeper mentality of a creator,
122000	127000	then we should definitely take the chance to call them out, not just for audience awareness of the specific situation,
127000	131000	but to understand the underlying mentality that can often drive these incidents.
131000	136000	Now, there's little dispute of certain contents regarding the character at the centre of today's topic,
136000	139000	however, that's definitely not the entirety of what I want to look at,
139000	144000	because stating that animal abuse is bad doesn't really add much, even though it undoubtedly is.
144000	149000	So with that in mind, let's talk about a person at the centre of today's controversy, Brooke Hautz.
149000	154000	Brooke Hautz is a creator who has been on the YouTube platform for a good five years.
154000	160000	In her time, she's made a variety of content, however, like every creator, she definitely experienced her fair share of peaks and troughs,
160000	167000	covering storytimes, true crime, and her daily life, which is from the aspirations of an acting girl living it up in LA.
167000	173000	She's chasing her dreams, she's kneading that dough, and she's gonna turn that shizzle into bread.
173000	180000	Overall, research learned that she had been a fairly uncontroversial figure, covering topics with a fairly unexceptional approach.
180000	185000	There was a confidence surrounding what she made, and when combined with the market of clickbait content,
185000	190000	this would provide mild spikes of success, but it hadn't been so hot a lot of the time for her.
190000	195000	However, recently, Brooke had actually began to turn her channel around with some decent momentum.
195000	202000	This was mainly because she had a pet, a Doberman Pinscher named Sphinx, which has been typically bred to be a guard dog.
202000	209000	People who like videos about animals and her videos on the life of her dog were doing significantly better than any of her other content at the time.
209000	214000	It was appealing to her existing audience, and appealing to a new demographic of viewers as well.
214000	220000	Success was back on the cards, her acting career was abuzz, and she was living life as good as she could.
220000	222000	What could possibly go wrong?
222000	229000	Well, as per, it seems that Brooke wanted to upload some dog-related content, because her dog was a real draw for the view counter at the time,
229000	232000	and it was obviously natural that you want to make the most of it.
232000	240000	Brooke- I wanted to prank my dog. She's over there. I put plastic wrap on the door, I'm gonna have him run out, we're just gonna see what he does. I don't know.
240000	247000	What these pranks exactly ensued, well, we don't know, but we do know that there were some outtakes that probably shouldn't have been public.
247000	251000	However, to be honest, I'm quite glad they were.
270000	293000	Brooke- We love you. We love you, or whatever. We love you. We love you. We love you! We love you!
293000	296000	Yes, not good at all.
296000	301000	There are a few topics that people unite greater on than on the maltreatment of animals, especially pets.
301000	307000	We observed it recently with the Alinity Divine situation, an incident that was much tamer for what she did.
307000	311000	The topic will make people side with Peter, for goodness sake, which is an achievement in itself.
311000	319000	People perceive pets as loyal to you, and therefore when you not only disregard that loyalty, but actively exploit it, it is cancellation time.
319000	325000	And people really showed up for this one, the internet coming out in its hundreds and thousands, probably even millions,
325000	331000	in larger numbers than our actual subscriber count, which had gone from moderate green to a very deep shade of alizarin.
331000	334000	Crimson. Bob Ross has taken over me.
334000	339000	The YouTube creators obtained this story, and with its popularity, it was impossible to ignore.
339000	343000	Plenty of videos were made, some reporting, and some providing their opinions.
344000	350000	It didn't just stop there though, it went pretty mainstream too, with many news outlets covering it, and the additional developments that followed,
350000	356000	including a full blown police investigation, with many calling for her custody of the dog to be forfeited altogether,
356000	359000	with some offering to pick the dog up themselves.
359000	365000	Anyhow, when we have a conflict in which someone is unquestionably in the wrong, like any other, Brooke felt it was time to respond.
365000	369000	She put out two responses, one thanking those who were being kind and understanding,
369000	374000	and the others who were formally responding to those who had been dealing out the criticism in her direction.
374000	378000	They were not well received, and her account has gone dark since.
378000	383000	We will discuss the nature of these responses in the video, but I also want to have a look into what came before,
383000	388000	and what can be drawn from the obvious. She also released a video response recently, which I'll briefly break down to,
388000	391000	although it does not change too much else.
391000	398000	I think we should start from the start. I do not have anything else to add, so I suggest we jump right in.
399000	415000	INTRO
415000	420000	Brooke Houghton started her channel in 2014. Now I know there were definitely some uploads in that time,
420000	425000	however unfortunately they have been lost. A great sadness indeed.
425000	431000	I don't know exactly why she would have deleted these, but maybe she just didn't feel that they were part of what she wanted her channel to be.
431000	436000	So what did she want her channel to be? Well it seems that she wanted it to be about storytimes,
436000	440000	and boy do I love a good story. When I say storytimes in this instance,
440000	446000	I don't mean any of the actual storytimes that are someone telling you about something that legitimately happened,
446000	451000	no, we're talking about the Tana Mongeau type storytimes that are basically about as real as my sex life.
451000	458000	I've spoken about these briefly before, but basically people like hearing about stuff,
458000	464000	because people's lives can be a bit boring, and to hear these crazy things from a YouTube about some wild tale
464000	470000	where all these shenanigans took place seems appealing, you know, it's not my idea of an afternoon in front of the telly,
470000	476000	but each to their own. I understand the appeal, however what happened is that people realised that they could gradually
476000	481000	escalate these stories for the sake of views and clickbait, which essentially led to a race to the bottom,
481000	487000	in which people's stories became more and more outlandish. Equally this meant that there was a lot more leverage
487000	493000	in the clickbait, if you had a story that was crazy, I mean think how crazy you can make the thumbnail.
493000	499000	Suddenly a story about mowing the lawn became a story about how your dad fought a dangerous parasitic plant attack
499000	504000	on your household, am I doing this right? Maybe, I don't know, and yes, it is an exaggeration,
504000	511000	but you understand what I'm hinting at. But maybe, just maybe, Brooke would defy this stereotype, not really.
511000	518000	Of course, there were some videos that were more faithful to their title, such as the very riveting title of her being catfished,
518000	523000	but a lot of them were visibly rubbish from a mile away. One of the first observable videos on her channel was
523000	529000	Psycho Hairdresser Story. Okay, so firstly honey, you don't need to put a space between hair and dresser,
529000	535000	though you can if you want each their own, but it's one word, you might as well just put it together, have a bit of fun.
535000	541000	Secondly, when you see a title like that, what do you think? I'm thinking Sweeney Todd, or something like that,
541000	547000	someone who's lost the plot completely, they've gone psycho. Let's see what Brooke's going to reveal.
547000	552000	Like, well if you want your hair to get to platinum, we should leave it on, but we don't want to damage your hair,
552000	556000	or anything like that. And I was like, okay, yeah, that's reasonable, like whatever, just leave it on,
556000	564000	listen to this next part, okay? I say, just leave it on unless it is going to either fall out, or turn blue.
564000	570000	So they're getting kind of sassy with me, right? Like at this point they're being a little, like, agitated,
570000	575000	and I was like, I'm just trying to get my hair. As they're rinsing my hair out, I can tell that something's wrong.
575000	579000	They are kind of looking at it, they're calling people over, they're calling like the headmaster over,
579000	583000	they're like, what, like what's happening? And I'm like, oh my god, what's happening?
583000	588000	They blow dry it. It's chill, it's chill. We're blow drying my hair. I wasn't really paying attention,
588000	593000	but when the blow drying is done, the hair kind of underneath, she like pulls it forward, what does it look like?
593000	599000	It is freaking blue. And here is the real punchline, guys, here's the knee slapper.
599000	606000	When the lady, the headmaster, moves my hair in front, so I can see the blue, she's like,
607000	610000	is that cool sound enough for you?
610000	637000	I forget what it's called, but they put this stuff on my hair and they turned it back to blonde and it was fine.
637000	642000	It was just a really stressful time, okay? It was not lit, it was not lit.
642000	646000	So basically, she went to dye her hair, it went wrong, but it was fixed.
646000	651000	But nothing particularly psychotic, whatever, probably just a load of stressed out hair students
651000	654000	who were probably working overtime to sort Brooke's hair out.
654000	658000	And given the fact that it was resolved very shortly after, I don't really see this particularly
658000	663000	warranting a story, particularly one where you imply the blame is on the hairdresser.
663000	666000	I'm no hair expert, but I highly doubt platinum hair is an easy job.
666000	673000	It's a bit of a lack of empathy on Brooke's part, and I'm sure the people who dealt with her hair could have a story of their own.
673000	678000	But anyway, that's not the point, although it does reek of entitlement, which we might touch on later.
678000	684000	In another video, my teacher cut me. You might be surprised to find out, her teacher did not actually cut her.
684000	689000	I was almost impressed by the depths of clickbait she'd stooped to get the views.
689000	696000	She's growing a third nipple, she pissed herself in a library, and don't get her start about all the period disasters she has.
696000	704000	Her most embarrassing period story, her period horror story, another period story, but this time in a church.
704000	708000	What I found interesting is when one of her stories relating to a certain topic did well,
708000	711000	she suddenly recalled multiple stories on similar events.
711000	715000	Somehow they managed to mess her hair up again, and then she got kicked out of a salon.
715000	717000	I mean, Jesus Christ, what is even going on with her?
717000	722000	It does make me wonder what I need to do to have such an exciting, albeit embarrassing life.
722000	727000	I mean, of course I don't expect to have periods, that would be a bit concerning, but everything else aside,
727000	733000	Brooke content was pretty fake, I don't use that as a particular insult,
733000	739000	but the stories are so clearly exaggerated with such hilarious titles that it's almost reaching the point of self-parody.
739000	746000	I mean, imagine being one of Brooke's friends and seeing that she has 80,000 views talking about how she pissed herself in a library.
746000	752000	Now I digress, eventually, with enough clickbait and wacky stories, she did kick the momentum up on her channel.
752000	759000	Her videos received a good few hundred thousand views at least, but the thing is that none of what Brooke did was particularly unique.
759000	767000	Plenty of people were making similar content, and all she had done was latched onto a concept with moderate, but not exactly substantial success.
767000	773000	Brooke's stories were clickbait, and although you can have an infinite number of stories, with clickbait you get a bit more limited,
773000	776000	and when you use bait and switches, they will tune out.
776000	781000	However, there is something so humiliating about a lot of these stories, and their rather tepid delivery,
781000	785000	that makes me think that she might have some experience.
785000	788000	When you look at some of these, we really should have picked it up.
788000	793000	She burned down her friend's house, I mean, with all these stories, it does make me wonder why she isn't in jail already.
793000	798000	The stories just don't stop coming, it just keeps happening to our poor old friend Brooke.
798000	805000	But here's the thing, when you manage to make a story time channel about all these terrible things that just keep on happening to you,
805000	811000	all these horror stories, it must reach a point where you wonder if the problem is really with all these people around you,
811000	815000	and these psycho hairdressers, or if the problem was actually with you.
815000	826000	I feel like there is likely a compromise to be made here,
826000	830000	that there are a lot of these stories that might have an element of truth to them,
830000	833000	because stories do tend to reflect our lives and our experiences,
833000	838000	but I also think an unbelievably high amount of them are just completely off the rails exaggerated,
838000	841000	and I don't think that's particularly healthy, not for Brooke at least.
841000	846000	After the story time trend ended up in the gutter, Brooke chased around a little, tried a few things,
846000	849000	before jumping onto the true crime YouTuber trend.
849000	855000	Now, I love true crime, I've literally binge watched channels like Investigation Discovery for hours upon end,
855000	858000	but Brooke's videos, unfortunately, weren't particularly great.
858000	864000	If you want someone whose tone actually matches what they talk about, I'd recommend Ellen O'Neill, she's the queen.
864000	867000	Not literally the queen, just, you know, the queen.
867000	873000	I don't really have too much to add here, however, it does lead onto my next point, which is what I call a refresh phase.
873000	879000	One of the biggest problems is that a lot of the channel that she had cultivated at this point was on dormant subscribers,
879000	885000	that she had roped in using rather overtly transparent tactics that would never make people stick around anyway.
885000	891000	She embarrassed herself for views, basically, people only stick around when they really do admire a creator,
891000	894000	and nothing that Brooke did was particularly admirable.
894000	899000	Sometimes when creators want to make an evolution, they'll make a video saying they want things to change,
899000	902000	which is what Brooke decided that she was going to do.
902000	907000	Providing that nothing you've done in the past was terribly evil, a simple refresh can be good for the channel.
907000	912000	You might lose some subscribers who may be disappointed that you're not maintaining the content that they subscribe for,
912000	916000	but at the end of the day, you have to make what you enjoy. This is something she says herself.
916000	921000	And I'm staying true to who I am, and I don't care if it gets two views, I don't care if it gets two million views,
921000	926000	I don't care because I'm gonna love it, and I'm so excited for anyone who wants to be on this journey with me.
926000	932000	Of course, YouTube is my job, and I've had to make some tough decisions, and I've had to really think about this.
932000	935000	A lot of people love my storytimes, a lot of people love my true crime videos,
935000	939000	but at the end of the day, I'm not gonna make videos that don't make me happy.
939000	943000	You'd watch this and you'd think, you know what, fair enough, she wants to make content that she loves.
943000	945000	Fantastic, hooray.
945000	949000	As a side note, I feel I've developed a psychic ability to detect announcement videos,
949000	954000	because I saw that and it popped out immediately to me, even though it could have been basically anything.
954000	957000	But who wants to hear about psychic abilities? Let's talk about Brooke more.
957000	960000	A refresh is a great thing, but you have to believe it yourself.
960000	966000	The problem with Brooke's old content is that from any perspective, I can see it becoming psychologically grating.
966000	970000	Exaggerating storytimes doesn't seem like a huge thing on the surface, but basically,
970000	976000	creating an idea of a much more exciting life that you yourself weren't living would be deeply unfulfilling.
977000	984000	At least with people like Tana, they could go and live out their crazy fantasies after talking about them if they wanted to.
984000	987000	Brooke was never really successful enough to do that.
987000	992000	And true crime stuff, I mean, my parents used to become concerned for me when I watched that stuff for periods of time,
992000	995000	because of how grim it can truly be, and that's the thing.
995000	999000	Although an audience might have been able to give Brooke a fresh start,
999000	1004000	she was never really prepared to forget a formula that had worked out so much in her head before.
1004000	1008000	That's the thing. I don't think Brooke was used to being real on her channel,
1008000	1011000	no matter how many times she was prepared to tell herself that she was.
1011000	1017000	She was used to presenting an idealised version of herself, or whatever fit the template for the content that she was making,
1017000	1020000	and when something worked, she'd milk it until it was dry.
1020000	1025000	I'm not trying to be sympathetic to her here, because I have no sympathy for anything that she's done,
1025000	1030000	but what she was doing was an addiction. She was the prime embodiment of the idea that every time something works,
1030000	1033000	you gotta chase after it and run it into the ground.
1033000	1037000	That can be found in today's situation, because as we noted earlier, she had a pet.
1037000	1040000	A Doman Pinscher. Lovely guard dogs who are extremely loyal.
1040000	1043000	And you know what? I love dogs. I literally love dogs.
1043000	1047000	Dogs are easily my favourite pet, especially pastoral or guard dogs.
1047000	1050000	They are so committed, it fills an emotional void within me.
1050000	1056000	I love them. I get as excited as them when it comes to playing fetch, and it seems a lot of people are the same.
1056000	1059000	Pet videos have been performing excellently on YouTube recently.
1059000	1064000	There's a life in dogs that we really do appreciate, and then Brooke had a lightbulb moment.
1064000	1068000	She can make a video, but this time, make the dog the centre of attention.
1068000	1072000	In case you haven't noticed, Brooke isn't a very interesting person.
1072000	1078000	This could easily be proven back in the day when she had to rely on the craziness of her stories and clickbait to coast on views.
1078000	1083000	And when she uploaded other videos that weren't actually so focused on that, well, her views weren't tippy-top.
1083000	1087000	So in an attempt to revive her channel, she seemed to alter the perspective of the title,
1087000	1091000	and the video from herself to her pet Doberman, named Sphinx.
1091000	1094000	This was a good concept, and the video was nice.
1094000	1096000	It was well cut, and it carried a lot of energy.
1096000	1099000	Arguably, this was one of the best ideas that Brooke had for a while,
1099000	1106000	especially considering that regardless of the level of their success, her true crime videos were almost certainly demonetised.
1106000	1111000	This video was called Day in the Life of a Doberman Puppy, and well, it did what it said in the tin.
1111000	1114000	No active deception occurring there either.
1114000	1118000	So we have the perfect combination, ad-friendly content that people wanted to watch.
1118000	1125000	The formula was right, and finally, for the first time in months, people were tuning in en masse to view content all eyes on Brooke.
1125000	1129000	What would she do next? Well, what she always knew best.
1129000	1133000	Milk it, milk it, milk it until it's dry.
1133000	1139000	On top of this, ever since her quote, refresh phase, she'd adopted this minimalist matter-of-fact star titling,
1139000	1143000	which I guess was meant to convey that sort of Emma Chamberlain candidness.
1143000	1147000	I don't really buy it, and once again, with the follow-up videos for her dog,
1147000	1150000	they were kind of exaggerated to almost parody levels,
1150000	1153000	as if she was preparing for the inevitable controversy herself.
1153000	1158000	A very honest video, my real morning routine.
1158000	1162000	Every time she is rebranded, she wants to present it as her real self,
1162000	1166000	but all it revealed to me was a content chameleon trying to be recognised,
1166000	1170000	and throwing various ideas at the wall, and then spamming them when it stuck.
1170000	1175000	And that's not healthy, not productive, and only plays into a cycle when that inevitably dies.
1175000	1181000	The only way you can cope with that sort of mental strain is if you're completely void of any emotional connection to the content,
1181000	1187000	which is also a terrible way to go about it, because then it doesn't matter how you actually feel about that content.
1187000	1193000	All that matters is views, which will never fulfil you, because nothing like that will ever fully maintain itself.
1193000	1196000	When you've had your chance to make some views, nothing really matters,
1196000	1201000	not even the resources that were the reason you had those views in the first place.
1204000	1209000	A lot of people only know about the fact that Brookhounds abused this dog,
1209000	1211000	which was, on principle, bad enough.
1211000	1214000	However, with the additional information that we have unearthed today,
1214000	1220000	what we know is that this same dog was giving Brookhounds' dead channel a new lease of life.
1220000	1222000	The dog actually revived her channel.
1222000	1226000	This channel was built on a constant evolution of character,
1226000	1230000	and every change that she implemented didn't really show any hints of originality,
1230000	1234000	it just bit from other more successful formulas already held by other creators.
1234000	1239000	That's the problem though, although she said in her video that she wanted to make content that she cared about,
1239000	1244000	I do wonder if she ever cared about any of the content she made, given the way she went about it.
1244000	1249000	Now, making follow up videos to a video that has done well is not rare,
1249000	1252000	in fact, many sensible businessmen may do that.
1252000	1256000	I don't have any grudge against people who want to make the most of a successful video.
1256000	1260000	However, there is a line, and if creating a video is either of great detriment to you,
1260000	1264000	or anyone around you, then you should definitely think twice.
1264000	1267000	Unfortunately, Brook clearly doesn't have the capacity to think twice,
1267000	1270000	if we even grant her the capacity to think at all.
1271000	1275000	This is what I was saying at the start of the video about caring about your content.
1275000	1281000	Unless it's really low effort, really lightweight, then you have to be invested in the actual creation of it,
1281000	1286000	and what it took to get there, and not just the views it may yield, as exciting as they are.
1286000	1291000	Because if that's the case, then I do believe you begin to fall out of touch with your own humanity,
1291000	1298000	just mindlessly churning out what works, and if Brook was ever humane at all, then she clearly lost that grip.
1298000	1302000	I don't know what on earth she was thinking, even considering uploading that video to YouTube.
1302000	1308000	I know she didn't intentionally put it public, but the fact that it even had the possibility of being exposed,
1308000	1312000	almost seems like the perfect karma for what she actually did in the video.
1312000	1317000	As mentioned earlier, the video shows her behaving extremely aggressively to a dog,
1317000	1322000	behaving fairly unexceptionally, in many ways in an extremely friendly and affectionate manner.
1322000	1326000	The video is particularly bad, and I'll tell you why.
1326000	1330000	Because you have someone who may react in the moment to a pet catching them off guard,
1330000	1334000	or pissing them off, and although the reaction would still not be justified,
1334000	1339000	they have the brief moment to snap out of any rage that they may be in at that point.
1339000	1343000	Brook's behaviour was extremely confrontational and incessant,
1343000	1347000	to the point where she had the chance to think about how she was treating her dog.
1347000	1351000	She actively pursues it, and persists in abusive behaviour against it.
1351000	1355000	There is very little dispute about what actually happened in the video.
1355000	1358000	It's clear that she makes physical contact with the animal,
1358000	1362000	and yells at the dog at multiple points in an extremely aggressive manner.
1362000	1366000	The only thing that seems to be in any dispute, is the claim that she spat on her dog.
1366000	1370000	And even then, it's a minority, mostly comprised of Brook and her fans.
1374000	1378000	Unfortunately for Brook, that view was just too incriminating for there to be any real denial.
1378000	1382000	She moves her head in a way, and makes a sound that resembles spitting.
1382000	1386000	People are gonna call a spade a spade, as if the video wasn't bad enough as it was.
1386000	1390000	It's nasty, and you'd think she'd treat any pet with dignity,
1390000	1395000	let alone one that has actually brought her success that she could not provide herself.
1395000	1398000	I think the dog should receive its own YouTube channel, to be honest.
1398000	1402000	What were the motives for doing this? I mean, I've watched enough of Brookhounds' content now,
1402000	1407000	and I don't think she necessarily did it for pleasure, she didn't seem to be taking much enjoyment in it.
1407000	1411000	Although you really have to be quite a nasty person, or ready to be capable of this,
1411000	1414000	I would still probably expect a greater circumstantial motive.
1414000	1418000	What that is, I don't know, but I do know the dog should not be in her possession,
1418000	1420000	I think that's a pretty open and shut case.
1420000	1425000	If she is capable of doing that on camera, then heaven knows what she might be capable of doing off camera.
1425000	1429000	And often, I do think in some cases, people shouldn't necessarily lose their pets,
1429000	1434000	if I think that what they were doing was just incredibly ill-thought out, like I did with Alinity.
1434000	1440000	But the absolute visceral hatred in Brook's eyes, I mean, it seemed like she genuinely resented the dog.
1440000	1445000	To me, it just felt like she hated the fact that she had to make a video with this pet.
1445000	1450000	She's clearly forcing herself through, regardless, there is no way she is enjoying this.
1450000	1455000	In her video, she said she's gonna be pranking the dog, and at first I thought she was just pandering to the trends,
1455000	1458000	you know, combining dogs with pranks, epic style lol.
1458000	1461000	But what if she saw it as a way to get back at the dog?
1461000	1465000	I mean, pranks typically involve targeting some individual, or putting them through something,
1465000	1468000	and it doesn't seem like the most benign of pranks.
1468000	1470000	What's up everyone, it's your girl Brook here today.
1470000	1473000	For this video, I wanted to prank my dog.
1473000	1474000	Shh, he's over there.
1474000	1478000	I put plastic wrap on the door, I'm gonna have him run out, we're just gonna see what he does.
1478000	1479000	I don't know.
1479000	1482000	I doubt the dog will fully be able to understand the comedy side of it,
1482000	1485000	because normally when the prank's over, you know to explain it to the person,
1485000	1489000	and they laugh, or it's just fake and the other person's in on it regardless.
1489000	1493000	Neither are particularly practical in this instance, when the subject is a dog.
1493000	1497000	It makes me wonder if she does have some level of repressed hatred towards her dog
1497000	1501000	for basically becoming the star of her channel, which I know is a wacky theory,
1501000	1505000	but the amount of contempt generally seems like she loathes the dog,
1505000	1508000	and although there may be some other reason that we're not aware of,
1508000	1510000	there's nothing that can justify this.
1510000	1514000	She hits a dilemma, she either uploads a video with her dog and gains those views,
1514000	1518000	but sacrifices focus on her content on, you know, her,
1518000	1521000	or she tries to make videos about herself, has that feeling of validation,
1521000	1526000	but rescinding her child back to the era of, well, not the most overwhelming success.
1526000	1531000	She chose success, but sacrificed the one thing she cared about herself.
1531000	1534000	What if she was just angry she was losing her grip on that?
1534000	1536000	Now that's just my theory, my perspective.
1536000	1538000	I'm sure that I plethora.
1538000	1540000	At the end of it all, theories and explanations are important,
1540000	1543000	because then we can work out the consequences for that person,
1543000	1546000	and also the motivations so that we can prevent it in the future.
1546000	1549000	But as mentioned earlier, the consequences are pretty clear.
1549000	1553000	She is not fit to have a dog, whatever mentality she is in right now,
1553000	1557000	to hurt an animal as genuinely loyal, there's no two ways about it.
1557000	1561000	Regardless of theories, the conclusion doesn't change, so I won't dwell on it for much longer.
1561000	1563000	However, as mentioned earlier, she responded,
1563000	1567000	and if there's one thing we love on the right opinion, it's a good response.
1567000	1569000	But if there's one thing we love more, it's a bad one.
1580000	1583000	Now, Brooke's career was already over.
1583000	1586000	There was literally nothing that could save her YouTube channel.
1586000	1592000	It was finished, done, ended, fini, closed the curtains, the fat lady is singing,
1592000	1596000	unless she had an evil doppelganger who was the product of a failed experimental project
1596000	1598000	take over from her and punish the dog.
1598000	1600000	But that just sounds like a wacky film plot.
1600000	1605000	Honestly, I was grudgingly impressed by the fact that she even put out a response,
1605000	1607000	but it doesn't make it good of course.
1607000	1611000	Obviously, you have to ignore her first response, which thanks people for being understanding,
1611000	1617000	which is unbelievably hilarious, as I don't think understanding is exactly the adjective I'd use to capture the moment.
1617000	1621000	I mean, if she does genuinely feel their understanding, then their understanding of the situation
1621000	1625000	is that she deserves to face much harsher consequences than she has.
1625000	1629000	When realising that people weren't quite as sympathetic towards her case as she thought they were,
1629000	1633000	she decided to put out a more lengthy statement addressing her little mishaps.
1633000	1637000	So, firstly, I hate to be pedantic, but when writing a formal apology,
1637000	1641000	try and get the spelling and grammar correct, please.
1641000	1644000	I don't expect perfect spelling and grammar a lot of the time.
1644000	1647000	Hell, I can't even expect it from my own editors half the time.
1647000	1651000	But when you're writing a serious apology, get someone to read it through.
1651000	1653000	Read it through yourself, whatever perfects it.
1653000	1658000	You want to make sure that you show yourself as taking this as seriously as possible,
1658000	1662000	so confusing affected with affected is not good.
1662000	1667000	For those who aren't aware, affected with an A at the start implies a verb, a doing word.
1667000	1670000	I affected your emotions.
1670000	1677000	If you have an effect with an E as in a noun, then it would be you having an effect on someone.
1677000	1682000	The only time you use affected with an E is when you've carried out something.
1682000	1688000	So, for example, I affected a policy in which I sacked my editors for spelling words wrong.
1688000	1691000	You see what I did there, editors? You see? Good.
1699000	1700000	That's a side note.
1700000	1704000	Now, I've spoken about the aesthetics of apologies, but it means nothing in this instance.
1704000	1710000	Unfortunately, for example, in my Pokemon video, I spoke about how it's important to frame your mental state.
1710000	1713000	It's not exactly excusing your actions, but as explaining them.
1713000	1718000	If you can show your judgment as diminished to the point where it may lead you to make a bad call,
1718000	1720000	people may be more forgiving.
1720000	1725000	Brooke does actually employ this, but completely fails to recognize that she doesn't satisfy
1725000	1729000	the amount of diminished judgment that would be required to abuse your dog,
1729000	1731000	which is the key problem here.
1731000	1738000	Having a bad week, having a bad month, having a bad year, having a bad decade does not justify her actions,
1738000	1743000	and although she does acknowledge that, it does bring into contention why she's posting that at all.
1743000	1747000	Another problem with her response is that she seems to focus on the fact that she shouted,
1747000	1751000	and although the hostility was rightfully criticized by many people,
1751000	1757000	I think people were also much more focused on the physical behavior exerted by our good friend Brooke here.
1757000	1763000	However, to counter this, she refutes the notion that she is an abuser, stating that she did not physically put the dog in pain,
1763000	1770000	or audibly put the dog in pain, I don't know how you audibly measure pain, I guess the dog didn't shout enough,
1770000	1776000	but a dog doesn't have to scream for pain to be elicited, this seems like an extremely weak defense.
1776000	1781000	She also disputes the claim that she spat on him, which once again is hard to argue with the glaring evidence,
1781000	1788000	but if she genuinely feels that she didn't, well what can I say, it seems obvious, but what can she do?
1789000	1793000	She then goes into a fairly incoherent ramble about how she's sorting out the dog,
1793000	1797000	which implies the dog held some responsibility for provoking the response from Brooke.
1797000	1805000	This is also referenced at the start of the response, where she says that it was necessary that she reacted in a way that enforced a sexual behavior,
1805000	1808000	such as not jumping up in your face with the mouth open.
1808000	1813000	I mean, that is a pretty natural thing that many dogs do, unless it was occurring on an excessive basis,
1813000	1817000	then I don't think you need to take any action, let alone what you did.
1817000	1821000	The whole talking about all the lessons the dog is taking just seems insulting really,
1821000	1826000	when the spotlight is on what she can do as a dog owner to improve.
1826000	1831000	Despite admitting that she's messed up, she doesn't seem to want to talk about what she's going to do to improve herself.
1831000	1837000	Talking about untraining the dog so he doesn't provoke her again, I mean, that's just a bad look on her part,
1837000	1841000	because it makes it seem like she's trying to avoid the situation provoking her reaction again,
1841000	1844000	which implies she doesn't have faith in her own patience.
1844000	1849000	Now, of course, she does say briefly towards the end that she's going to be working on her own side,
1849000	1855000	but I feel the whole there's two sides to this narrative doesn't work when the other side is a literal dog,
1855000	1859000	and we've already observed the actual side through the lens of a camera.
1859000	1864000	The other thing that Brooke constantly turns to in this instance is the appeal to authority,
1864000	1868000	the idea that anyone who truly knows her knows that everything's fine,
1868000	1873000	and she's a loving dog parent, which is a bad argument if no one's really willing to back it up themselves.
1873000	1878000	On top of this, some people who claim to know you don't seem very favourable at all.
1878000	1883000	Um, but me and Brooke had just a date about like two years ago, um, in this thing called Superpower Couple,
1883000	1885000	it was dumb, it was stupid, it was pointless.
1885000	1890000	Uh, yeah, so she came to visit me in Florida for about a week, um, and just yet they're out there too,
1890000	1893000	she's vegan, and she did not shower one time while she was there,
1893000	1897000	and we gave her all the necessities that she needed to shower, and she just did not do it.
1897000	1901000	My mom even said something to me. It was absolutely disgusting.
1901000	1905000	Um, but I'm not here to talk about that, I'm here to talk about how she treated my dog.
1905000	1907000	Um, I have a minutestionality, she's small.
1907000	1911000	Uh, she would throw my dog around as if it was a cat, and I didn't see anything of it at the time,
1911000	1917000	but now that this dog stuff is coming out, it makes so much sense, uh, that she is not a fan of animals,
1917000	1922000	or she just doesn't like to treat animals with the same respect as if you would treat a human being, you know?
1922000	1927000	Um, but, uh, she didn't want the dog to sleep near us at all while she stayed there, or anything like that.
1927000	1930000	It's very messed up, and I do not think she deserves that dog.
1930000	1934000	Now, he might have just said this for the clout for all I know, but it's risky business
1934000	1938000	saying that anyone who knows you will be on your side because then someone who knows you
1938000	1941000	who subsequently calls you out would invalidate your argument,
1941000	1946000	unless you suddenly claim that they actually aren't your real friends, no true Scotsman style.
1946000	1951000	She also makes the bold statement that anyone who has witnessed or heard animal abuse
1951000	1956000	will be able to see that her behaviour did not actually fit the criteria of abuse.
1956000	1962000	Once again, an awful thing to say, because you completely open yourself up to people with experience in the area
1962000	1966000	contradicting you, and then you just look like an idiot.
1966000	1970000	It also seems very manipulative, implying that if you've seen animal abuse,
1970000	1973000	then you must be able to see that this ain't the same.
1973000	1977000	The sad thing is, she seems so convinced that she's just out here doing her best,
1977000	1980000	and this small blip is something that she'll emerge from.
1980000	1984000	It's not. As a statement, it seems like she wants to present more context,
1984000	1989000	but saying, I'm the good guy, I promise, to a rabid horde of angry viewers doesn't work.
1989000	1994000	She says she doesn't want to defend her actions, but there's no other way to look at this
1994000	1999000	other than an attempt to explain or justify, she tries to act as a third person observer
1999000	2004000	into this situation that she was directly involved in, as if she's the one fact checking and correcting.
2004000	2008000	I'm sorry girl, you don't receive that liberty, you lost the game.
2008000	2012000	As mentioned briefly at the start, she also released a video titled A Message For You.
2012000	2016000	She doesn't really add too much, other than stating that she's now volunteering at a shelter.
2017000	2025000	I'm now a volunteer at a local animal welfare organization, and so I'm really happy and excited about that.
2025000	2034000	And since the matter I have invested in professional dog training, I'm learning so much,
2034000	2041000	and I promise you that my pet owner relationship is stronger than ever.
2041000	2046000	Good for her, I guess, but one of the really annoying things was this to me actually.
2046000	2053000	Thank you for that, and I also want to apologize to anyone who was offended.
2053000	2060000	It has never been and will never be my intention to hurt or offend anyone, ever.
2060000	2066000	I'm not going to sit here and try to justify my actions, I'm just not going to do that.
2066000	2069000	I really hate this phrase, it's one of my least favourite phrases.
2069000	2072000	Why is she sorry if you were offended?
2072000	2077000	For me, why is it so hard to just apologize for the action rather than the reaction?
2077000	2081000	It's not like you said an edgy joke and someone may have taken it the wrong way.
2081000	2084000	You actually made physical contact with a dog on camera.
2084000	2086000	Why is it so hard to take responsibility?
2086000	2090000	She also says she welcomes the discussion about this little incident.
2090000	2097000	I want to say thank you to anyone who has reached out about this topic
2097000	2100000	or engaged in this discussion over the past month or so.
2100000	2105000	I just want to genuinely say thank you because I think as a society,
2105000	2110000	it is so important that we continue to talk about things we feel need to be talked about
2110000	2114000	and discuss issues we feel need to be discussed.
2114000	2116000	And I would love for you to get to know me.
2116000	2126000	And for any YouTuber or other influencers or other public figures even who have commented on this situation,
2126000	2131000	I pray, I pray that one day we can meet.
2131000	2134000	Because I would love to show you who I really am
2134000	2139000	and I would love to show you my true heart and personality.
2139000	2142000	Once again with this tone as if she is the moderator of a debate
2142000	2147000	rather than the subject of an animal abuse scandal, please give it a rest.
2147000	2151000	You can say that you'd love to meet everyone who's made a video on you and changed their mind,
2151000	2153000	but the simple fact is you won't change their mind.
2153000	2157000	People can pretend to be nice, you know, that was the point of why people have turned on you.
2157000	2159000	I think many have seen enough.
2159000	2161000	And that brings us to our final part.
2172000	2183000	There are two simple points I want to emphasise here,
2183000	2186000	that there is nothing wrong with presenting things from your perspective,
2186000	2189000	and there's nothing wrong with even correcting misconceptions,
2189000	2195000	but you can't make it the centre of that when there are much greater claims to be addressed.
2195000	2199000	Brooke needs to understand that the video has done all the reputational damage
2199000	2202000	that cannot be rectified with a matter-of-fact response.
2202000	2204000	There have definitely been worse responses,
2204000	2208000	but I think the problem was that there was no text response that could communicate
2208000	2213000	the level of remorse that many would perceive as necessary to vindicate her,
2213000	2215000	maybe even no response at all.
2215000	2218000	As said, I think it would have been a near impossible sell as it was,
2218000	2222000	and if she had shown too much emotion, it probably would have been seen as pity bait.
2222000	2226000	But there's still a balance, and you can't come in with a tone that says to people,
2226000	2230000	you know, I really shouldn't shout it that way, but the dog was in my face,
2230000	2233000	and I was in a bad mood, and the dog has been acting up recently,
2233000	2236000	so we're gonna get it training, don't worry, it won't happen again,
2236000	2240000	anyone who really knows me knows this isn't how I normally act.
2240000	2243000	Please don't take too many implications from it.
2243000	2248000	Unfortunately for Brooke, leaked videos that aren't intended for the public eye
2248000	2252000	are probably the sort of content that people take the most implications from,
2252000	2254000	because at that point, you're not playing a character.
2254000	2257000	In her response, she defends her regular persona,
2257000	2260000	that bubbly, friendly Brooke is her standard mood,
2260000	2264000	but whether she was in a good or bad mood cannot really justify such actions.
2264000	2268000	That's the point, we've all done irrational stuff when we're pissed off,
2268000	2270000	but there's a line for many people, and you know,
2270000	2274000	a pet dog isn't just for the good days, but it's also for the bad days,
2274000	2276000	when we're feeling down, and when we're feeling down,
2276000	2280000	we shouldn't try and force ourselves or our pets through another video
2280000	2282000	for the sake of ad revenue.
2282000	2285000	Sit it out, spend some time with your dog,
2285000	2288000	your dog is meant to cheer you up when you're feeling bad.
2288000	2291000	The video didn't just tell us about Brooke's mentality in the moment,
2291000	2294000	but to me it said a lot about her own perception of content creation,
2294000	2299000	don't make content that under no circumstances you could see yourself caring about,
2299000	2302000	don't view sentient beings as view traffic,
2302000	2308000	don't tell people that this is your honest, true videos if that is not the case,
2308000	2311000	and don't put it in your titles, I mean, how much more obvious could you be?
2312000	2317000	We all know that people's lies, particularly when represented through the highlight reel of a vlog, are exaggerated,
2317000	2322000	but we still like to imagine that the person has some investment in how they carry themselves,
2322000	2327000	and we still like to imagine how they behave in less than ideal environments,
2327000	2332000	behind the scenes, even if they're having a bad day, even if they make a bad call,
2332000	2334000	even if they lash out from time to time,
2334000	2339000	there was nothing that could suddenly justify the sort of person that we observed in that video,
2339000	2343000	and nothing that gave us the implications that she was like that at all,
2343000	2348000	in her statement she said she wasn't trying to convince people who thought she was a bad person otherwise,
2348000	2351000	but I think that's definitely what she should have been trying to do,
2351000	2354000	it's all good saying I know myself kind of thing,
2354000	2359000	but I think people believing you're a decent person is a good thing to communicate as well,
2359000	2363000	particularly when I'm pretty sure you've tried to convey that message through your content,
2363000	2368000	unless she was implying that people who thought she was a bad person were just too unreasonable,
2368000	2371000	but I think that would be a rather unearned argument at this stage,
2371000	2375000	I think it was a case that reasoning led people to believe you were a bad person,
2375000	2379000	but you know what, she is right to an extent, as mentioned earlier,
2379000	2383000	there wasn't much she could have said at this stage that would have changed people's perception,
2383000	2387000	maybe she just did it as a public statement due to the impending police investigation,
2387000	2390000	maybe with everything considered it was the best thing to do,
2390000	2394000	however even with that considered it was a pretty poor statement because
2394000	2398000	police and authorities are swayed by emotional sentiments like remorse and regret too,
2398000	2401000	and she just overall fails to show that,
2401000	2405000	being able to blame circumstances may work when you're talking about a psycho hairdresser,
2405000	2407000	but not a bloody dog,
2407000	2410000	the whole statement just seems too distant from the situation itself,
2410000	2414000	and that distance is something that perhaps she's felt for too long,
2414000	2418000	we've all had the case where we ask ourselves why we're doing YouTube,
2418000	2423000	that sort of existential crisis that will eventually be answered when we find our creative flair,
2423000	2429000	but I was constantly asking myself why Brooke was doing YouTube when watching her content,
2429000	2432000	and there's nothing wrong with doing a variety of content,
2432000	2437000	but from the start it constantly seemed like a grapple with trends that were so fleeting and insubstantial
2437000	2441000	that they could never yield the lasting success that Brooke clearly aspired for,
2441000	2446000	and every time something did work she'd maximise it and then it'd die,
2446000	2449000	and she'd be back to square one, and this time the dog revived her channel,
2449000	2454000	in some ways that would be an inspiring tale for someone who sees the interaction as a positive outcome,
2454000	2458000	but her behaviour wasn't of someone who genuinely appreciated that,
2458000	2462000	it was the same sort of rancid entitlement that pervaded some of her earlier storytimes,
2462000	2467000	storytimes really do appeal to the inner narcissist because it's talking about yourself,
2467000	2472000	and unlike other storytimes like animation which can appeal to artistic creativity,
2472000	2474000	it's all about number one,
2474000	2480000	one of the things I noticed was that out of a ten minute video Brooke would sometimes spend two or three minutes just talking about herself,
2480000	2484000	and at first I thought she was just filling up the runtime to insert the mid-rolls,
2484000	2489000	but maybe she's literally that self-obsessed, she talks about this a lot of the time as well.
2489000	2494000	You can't not watch storytime videos, I don't know, or at least maybe that's just me,
2494000	2499000	maybe I'm just weird and have an addiction like that, but I really love storytime videos,
2499000	2506000	I don't think I've ever done an intro so fast, can we just applaud right now, like applause please, standing ovation,
2506000	2513000	like let me hear it, oh calm down, let me hear it, no it's okay, no come on bring it on, wow I'm so annoying, literally I'm so sorry,
2513000	2518000	I like how I'm not even acknowledging the fact that I look like literal ass right now,
2518000	2523000	not figuratively literal ass, like literally, like what, like what is happening?
2523000	2528000	Caring is important, and it's clear that Brooke cared about something,
2528000	2533000	but it wasn't the content, it wasn't the output, it was a status that she constantly chased,
2533000	2539000	and whatever motivation for her cruel, spiteful behaviour towards a dog who was so clearly loyal to her,
2539000	2544000	it's clear that what she cared about was greater than the content she was creating at the time.
2544000	2551000	If I was revealed to not actually believe a lot of my opinions, if I was revealed to actually love a bit of dog on dog,
2551000	2554000	then I think people would have the right to feel misled,
2554000	2559000	these videos were meant to be honest snapshots of a person or dog's life, but they weren't,
2559000	2565000	and the one time we see something that we're not meant to see, it's unbelievably, viscerally negative,
2565000	2570000	and it wasn't even leaked by someone who may be trying to bias that perception, it was Brooke herself,
2570000	2578000	she made a career of being exaggerative and being fake, it's only ironic that her one moment of honesty is her downfall.
2578000	2584000	Brooke's career as a YouTuber I think is over, her status as a dog owner is hopefully over now too,
2584000	2590000	but I'd always use these situations as a message to audiences, and even friends and family of these people,
2590000	2595000	to make sure those you support are real, genuinely care about these things.
2595000	2601000	I know it's hard to judge, and I'm not saying we can often do that, but when it is exposed, hold them to a standard,
2601000	2607000	because when you don't know what someone's really like and you give them something that they want to keep at all costs,
2607000	2609000	then this can happen.
2609000	2614000	They'll do it when they're feeling good, when they're feeling bad, and regardless of who gets hurt,
2614000	2616000	even if it's man's best friend.
2623000	2630000	So yes, that was the video, I want to give a big shoutout to my editors who've once again probably done a fantastic,
2630000	2636000	legendary job, I'm going to leave their links in the pinned comment and send them all the love they deserve.
2636000	2638000	Fantastic, fantastic people.
2638000	2644000	I'd also like to give a big thanks to my Patreons, the $10 Patreons are up on screen right now,
2644000	2651000	I have to thank my $50 Patreons personally though, and that is Sumhala Baloo, The Specter Angel,
2651000	2659000	Bowright, Nico Deschamps, Sarah Elizabeth, and Caroline. Fantastic, thank you so much, it really makes a difference.
2659000	2667000	I'd also like to extend a very special thanks to my $100 Patreons, Brandon, Adam Michael, and Christopher Carrasse.
2667000	2671000	Thank you so much, I can't express it enough, you know, it makes a whole lot of difference.
2671000	2676000	If you want to hit me up on Twitter, I'm at The Right Opinion, Facebook The Right Opinion Official,
2676000	2679000	and my Discord will be in the pinned comment too.
2679000	2687000	I have a new Instagram, I'm trying to use Instagram, honestly, I'm a bit confused by it, not because I'm a boomer, I promise,
2687000	2693000	mainly because I guess it's for people whose lives are interesting, and my life just isn't interesting.
2693000	2700000	I feel bad for saying that, I'm probably the most interesting aspect about my own life, and that's only because I'm a bit insane.
2700000	2706000	I don't think I have too much else to add, I hope you guys are having a decent week, I'll send my love as always,
2706000	2710000	and I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you in the next one.
2717000	2721000	Thanks for watching!
