00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
and care, something that I would argue is very important in YouTube videos.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
My content has been a long journey from 2016, where I would rant about domestic UK politics in figures

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
who most people in this video probably wouldn't even know in the slightest.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
And now we're here, where I make long-form videos on drama and conflicts, and the sorts of mentalities that lie behind them.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
However, one thing has never changed, the fact that I do care deeply about the topics I discuss.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
Every now and then, I get the comment about how I've changed from what I used to do, and honestly, I have,

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
and it has brought me considerable success over previous topics of interest.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
But honestly, if I wasn't interested in the topics that I spoke about, if I wasn't invested in it,

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
if I didn't think I had something to say, then I probably wouldn't have the tolerance to talk about it for half an hour in multiple videos.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
Make no mistake, you don't have to like my videos, but I do care about them.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
And that's the thing, I've always loved talking, in case you don't have that impression already.

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
I love hearing opinions too, and honestly, if I don't have an opinion on something, it probably means I just haven't had the time to look into it.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
I've always loved looking up things and establishing what I actually feel about it, and then communicating it to a greater audience.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
I've always argued that it is important to care about the content that you're actually making.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
I obviously can't sit here and look into the mind of every single person that I'm analysing in my videos,

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
which is why I don't tend to state intent, but I obviously have my own opinions on why I feel some people make their videos.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
But it would be such a level of conjecture that I seldom include that speculation.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
Personally, it's always safe to decide on the benefit of the doubt when making videos about people's intent,

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
because I think a false negative is much more harmful than a false positive.

01:43.000 --> 01:50.000
If people take the assumption that a person is good, then that may still have grounds to be changed in the future if that person behaves out of order more obviously.

01:50.000 --> 01:57.000
However, if the community assumes a person is bad, then I do think it gives the person a tougher job to grind out a redemption arc.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
Nonetheless, when someone behaves in a way that I do feel underlines a much deeper mentality of a creator,

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
then we should definitely take the chance to call them out, not just for audience awareness of the specific situation,

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
but to understand the underlying mentality that can often drive these incidents.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
Now, there's little dispute of certain contents regarding the character at the centre of today's topic,

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
however, that's definitely not the entirety of what I want to look at,

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
because stating that animal abuse is bad doesn't really add much, even though it undoubtedly is.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
So with that in mind, let's talk about a person at the centre of today's controversy, Brooke Hautz.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
Brooke Hautz is a creator who has been on the YouTube platform for a good five years.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
In her time, she's made a variety of content, however, like every creator, she definitely experienced her fair share of peaks and troughs,

02:40.000 --> 02:47.000
covering storytimes, true crime, and her daily life, which is from the aspirations of an acting girl living it up in LA.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
She's chasing her dreams, she's kneading that dough, and she's gonna turn that shizzle into bread.

02:53.000 --> 03:00.000
Overall, research learned that she had been a fairly uncontroversial figure, covering topics with a fairly unexceptional approach.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
There was a confidence surrounding what she made, and when combined with the market of clickbait content,

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
this would provide mild spikes of success, but it hadn't been so hot a lot of the time for her.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
However, recently, Brooke had actually began to turn her channel around with some decent momentum.

03:15.000 --> 03:22.000
This was mainly because she had a pet, a Doberman Pinscher named Sphinx, which has been typically bred to be a guard dog.

03:22.000 --> 03:29.000
People who like videos about animals and her videos on the life of her dog were doing significantly better than any of her other content at the time.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
It was appealing to her existing audience, and appealing to a new demographic of viewers as well.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
Success was back on the cards, her acting career was abuzz, and she was living life as good as she could.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
What could possibly go wrong?

03:42.000 --> 03:49.000
Well, as per, it seems that Brooke wanted to upload some dog-related content, because her dog was a real draw for the view counter at the time,

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
and it was obviously natural that you want to make the most of it.

03:52.000 --> 04:00.000
Brooke- I wanted to prank my dog. She's over there. I put plastic wrap on the door, I'm gonna have him run out, we're just gonna see what he does. I don't know.

04:00.000 --> 04:07.000
What these pranks exactly ensued, well, we don't know, but we do know that there were some outtakes that probably shouldn't have been public.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
However, to be honest, I'm quite glad they were.

04:30.000 --> 04:53.000
Brooke- We love you. We love you, or whatever. We love you. We love you. We love you! We love you!

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Yes, not good at all.

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
There are a few topics that people unite greater on than on the maltreatment of animals, especially pets.

05:01.000 --> 05:07.000
We observed it recently with the Alinity Divine situation, an incident that was much tamer for what she did.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
The topic will make people side with Peter, for goodness sake, which is an achievement in itself.

05:11.000 --> 05:19.000
People perceive pets as loyal to you, and therefore when you not only disregard that loyalty, but actively exploit it, it is cancellation time.

05:19.000 --> 05:25.000
And people really showed up for this one, the internet coming out in its hundreds and thousands, probably even millions,

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
in larger numbers than our actual subscriber count, which had gone from moderate green to a very deep shade of alizarin.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Crimson. Bob Ross has taken over me.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
The YouTube creators obtained this story, and with its popularity, it was impossible to ignore.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
Plenty of videos were made, some reporting, and some providing their opinions.

05:44.000 --> 05:50.000
It didn't just stop there though, it went pretty mainstream too, with many news outlets covering it, and the additional developments that followed,

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
including a full blown police investigation, with many calling for her custody of the dog to be forfeited altogether,

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
with some offering to pick the dog up themselves.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
Anyhow, when we have a conflict in which someone is unquestionably in the wrong, like any other, Brooke felt it was time to respond.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
She put out two responses, one thanking those who were being kind and understanding,

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
and the others who were formally responding to those who had been dealing out the criticism in her direction.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
They were not well received, and her account has gone dark since.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
We will discuss the nature of these responses in the video, but I also want to have a look into what came before,

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
and what can be drawn from the obvious. She also released a video response recently, which I'll briefly break down to,

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
although it does not change too much else.

06:31.000 --> 06:38.000
I think we should start from the start. I do not have anything else to add, so I suggest we jump right in.

06:39.000 --> 06:55.000
INTRO

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
Brooke Houghton started her channel in 2014. Now I know there were definitely some uploads in that time,

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
however unfortunately they have been lost. A great sadness indeed.

07:05.000 --> 07:11.000
I don't know exactly why she would have deleted these, but maybe she just didn't feel that they were part of what she wanted her channel to be.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
So what did she want her channel to be? Well it seems that she wanted it to be about storytimes,

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
and boy do I love a good story. When I say storytimes in this instance,

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
I don't mean any of the actual storytimes that are someone telling you about something that legitimately happened,

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
no, we're talking about the Tana Mongeau type storytimes that are basically about as real as my sex life.

07:31.000 --> 07:38.000
I've spoken about these briefly before, but basically people like hearing about stuff,

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
because people's lives can be a bit boring, and to hear these crazy things from a YouTube about some wild tale

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
where all these shenanigans took place seems appealing, you know, it's not my idea of an afternoon in front of the telly,

07:50.000 --> 07:56.000
but each to their own. I understand the appeal, however what happened is that people realised that they could gradually

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
escalate these stories for the sake of views and clickbait, which essentially led to a race to the bottom,

08:01.000 --> 08:07.000
in which people's stories became more and more outlandish. Equally this meant that there was a lot more leverage

08:07.000 --> 08:13.000
in the clickbait, if you had a story that was crazy, I mean think how crazy you can make the thumbnail.

08:13.000 --> 08:19.000
Suddenly a story about mowing the lawn became a story about how your dad fought a dangerous parasitic plant attack

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
on your household, am I doing this right? Maybe, I don't know, and yes, it is an exaggeration,

08:24.000 --> 08:31.000
but you understand what I'm hinting at. But maybe, just maybe, Brooke would defy this stereotype, not really.

08:31.000 --> 08:38.000
Of course, there were some videos that were more faithful to their title, such as the very riveting title of her being catfished,

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
but a lot of them were visibly rubbish from a mile away. One of the first observable videos on her channel was

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
Psycho Hairdresser Story. Okay, so firstly honey, you don't need to put a space between hair and dresser,

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
though you can if you want each their own, but it's one word, you might as well just put it together, have a bit of fun.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
Secondly, when you see a title like that, what do you think? I'm thinking Sweeney Todd, or something like that,

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
someone who's lost the plot completely, they've gone psycho. Let's see what Brooke's going to reveal.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
Like, well if you want your hair to get to platinum, we should leave it on, but we don't want to damage your hair,

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
or anything like that. And I was like, okay, yeah, that's reasonable, like whatever, just leave it on,

09:16.000 --> 09:24.000
listen to this next part, okay? I say, just leave it on unless it is going to either fall out, or turn blue.

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
So they're getting kind of sassy with me, right? Like at this point they're being a little, like, agitated,

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
and I was like, I'm just trying to get my hair. As they're rinsing my hair out, I can tell that something's wrong.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
They are kind of looking at it, they're calling people over, they're calling like the headmaster over,

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
they're like, what, like what's happening? And I'm like, oh my god, what's happening?

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
They blow dry it. It's chill, it's chill. We're blow drying my hair. I wasn't really paying attention,

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
but when the blow drying is done, the hair kind of underneath, she like pulls it forward, what does it look like?

09:53.000 --> 09:59.000
It is freaking blue. And here is the real punchline, guys, here's the knee slapper.

09:59.000 --> 10:06.000
When the lady, the headmaster, moves my hair in front, so I can see the blue, she's like,

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
is that cool sound enough for you?

10:10.000 --> 10:37.000
I forget what it's called, but they put this stuff on my hair and they turned it back to blonde and it was fine.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
It was just a really stressful time, okay? It was not lit, it was not lit.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
So basically, she went to dye her hair, it went wrong, but it was fixed.

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
But nothing particularly psychotic, whatever, probably just a load of stressed out hair students

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
who were probably working overtime to sort Brooke's hair out.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
And given the fact that it was resolved very shortly after, I don't really see this particularly

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
warranting a story, particularly one where you imply the blame is on the hairdresser.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
I'm no hair expert, but I highly doubt platinum hair is an easy job.

11:06.000 --> 11:13.000
It's a bit of a lack of empathy on Brooke's part, and I'm sure the people who dealt with her hair could have a story of their own.

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
But anyway, that's not the point, although it does reek of entitlement, which we might touch on later.

11:18.000 --> 11:24.000
In another video, my teacher cut me. You might be surprised to find out, her teacher did not actually cut her.

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
I was almost impressed by the depths of clickbait she'd stooped to get the views.

11:29.000 --> 11:36.000
She's growing a third nipple, she pissed herself in a library, and don't get her start about all the period disasters she has.

11:36.000 --> 11:44.000
Her most embarrassing period story, her period horror story, another period story, but this time in a church.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
What I found interesting is when one of her stories relating to a certain topic did well,

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
she suddenly recalled multiple stories on similar events.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
Somehow they managed to mess her hair up again, and then she got kicked out of a salon.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
I mean, Jesus Christ, what is even going on with her?

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
It does make me wonder what I need to do to have such an exciting, albeit embarrassing life.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
I mean, of course I don't expect to have periods, that would be a bit concerning, but everything else aside,

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
Brooke content was pretty fake, I don't use that as a particular insult,

12:13.000 --> 12:19.000
but the stories are so clearly exaggerated with such hilarious titles that it's almost reaching the point of self-parody.

12:19.000 --> 12:26.000
I mean, imagine being one of Brooke's friends and seeing that she has 80,000 views talking about how she pissed herself in a library.

12:26.000 --> 12:32.000
Now I digress, eventually, with enough clickbait and wacky stories, she did kick the momentum up on her channel.

12:32.000 --> 12:39.000
Her videos received a good few hundred thousand views at least, but the thing is that none of what Brooke did was particularly unique.

12:39.000 --> 12:47.000
Plenty of people were making similar content, and all she had done was latched onto a concept with moderate, but not exactly substantial success.

12:47.000 --> 12:53.000
Brooke's stories were clickbait, and although you can have an infinite number of stories, with clickbait you get a bit more limited,

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
and when you use bait and switches, they will tune out.

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
However, there is something so humiliating about a lot of these stories, and their rather tepid delivery,

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
that makes me think that she might have some experience.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
When you look at some of these, we really should have picked it up.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
She burned down her friend's house, I mean, with all these stories, it does make me wonder why she isn't in jail already.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.000
The stories just don't stop coming, it just keeps happening to our poor old friend Brooke.

13:18.000 --> 13:25.000
But here's the thing, when you manage to make a story time channel about all these terrible things that just keep on happening to you,

13:25.000 --> 13:31.000
all these horror stories, it must reach a point where you wonder if the problem is really with all these people around you,

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
and these psycho hairdressers, or if the problem was actually with you.

13:35.000 --> 13:46.000
I feel like there is likely a compromise to be made here,

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
that there are a lot of these stories that might have an element of truth to them,

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
because stories do tend to reflect our lives and our experiences,

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
but I also think an unbelievably high amount of them are just completely off the rails exaggerated,

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
and I don't think that's particularly healthy, not for Brooke at least.

14:01.000 --> 14:06.000
After the story time trend ended up in the gutter, Brooke chased around a little, tried a few things,

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
before jumping onto the true crime YouTuber trend.

14:09.000 --> 14:15.000
Now, I love true crime, I've literally binge watched channels like Investigation Discovery for hours upon end,

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
but Brooke's videos, unfortunately, weren't particularly great.

14:18.000 --> 14:24.000
If you want someone whose tone actually matches what they talk about, I'd recommend Ellen O'Neill, she's the queen.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
Not literally the queen, just, you know, the queen.

14:27.000 --> 14:33.000
I don't really have too much to add here, however, it does lead onto my next point, which is what I call a refresh phase.

14:33.000 --> 14:39.000
One of the biggest problems is that a lot of the channel that she had cultivated at this point was on dormant subscribers,

14:39.000 --> 14:45.000
that she had roped in using rather overtly transparent tactics that would never make people stick around anyway.

14:45.000 --> 14:51.000
She embarrassed herself for views, basically, people only stick around when they really do admire a creator,

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
and nothing that Brooke did was particularly admirable.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
Sometimes when creators want to make an evolution, they'll make a video saying they want things to change,

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
which is what Brooke decided that she was going to do.

15:02.000 --> 15:07.000
Providing that nothing you've done in the past was terribly evil, a simple refresh can be good for the channel.

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
You might lose some subscribers who may be disappointed that you're not maintaining the content that they subscribe for,

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
but at the end of the day, you have to make what you enjoy. This is something she says herself.

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
And I'm staying true to who I am, and I don't care if it gets two views, I don't care if it gets two million views,

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
I don't care because I'm gonna love it, and I'm so excited for anyone who wants to be on this journey with me.

15:26.000 --> 15:32.000
Of course, YouTube is my job, and I've had to make some tough decisions, and I've had to really think about this.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
A lot of people love my storytimes, a lot of people love my true crime videos,

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
but at the end of the day, I'm not gonna make videos that don't make me happy.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
You'd watch this and you'd think, you know what, fair enough, she wants to make content that she loves.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Fantastic, hooray.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
As a side note, I feel I've developed a psychic ability to detect announcement videos,

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
because I saw that and it popped out immediately to me, even though it could have been basically anything.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
But who wants to hear about psychic abilities? Let's talk about Brooke more.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
A refresh is a great thing, but you have to believe it yourself.

16:00.000 --> 16:06.000
The problem with Brooke's old content is that from any perspective, I can see it becoming psychologically grating.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
Exaggerating storytimes doesn't seem like a huge thing on the surface, but basically,

16:10.000 --> 16:16.000
creating an idea of a much more exciting life that you yourself weren't living would be deeply unfulfilling.

16:17.000 --> 16:24.000
At least with people like Tana, they could go and live out their crazy fantasies after talking about them if they wanted to.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
Brooke was never really successful enough to do that.

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
And true crime stuff, I mean, my parents used to become concerned for me when I watched that stuff for periods of time,

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
because of how grim it can truly be, and that's the thing.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
Although an audience might have been able to give Brooke a fresh start,

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
she was never really prepared to forget a formula that had worked out so much in her head before.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
That's the thing. I don't think Brooke was used to being real on her channel,

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
no matter how many times she was prepared to tell herself that she was.

16:51.000 --> 16:57.000
She was used to presenting an idealised version of herself, or whatever fit the template for the content that she was making,

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
and when something worked, she'd milk it until it was dry.

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
I'm not trying to be sympathetic to her here, because I have no sympathy for anything that she's done,

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
but what she was doing was an addiction. She was the prime embodiment of the idea that every time something works,

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
you gotta chase after it and run it into the ground.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
That can be found in today's situation, because as we noted earlier, she had a pet.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
A Doman Pinscher. Lovely guard dogs who are extremely loyal.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
And you know what? I love dogs. I literally love dogs.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
Dogs are easily my favourite pet, especially pastoral or guard dogs.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
They are so committed, it fills an emotional void within me.

17:30.000 --> 17:36.000
I love them. I get as excited as them when it comes to playing fetch, and it seems a lot of people are the same.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
Pet videos have been performing excellently on YouTube recently.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
There's a life in dogs that we really do appreciate, and then Brooke had a lightbulb moment.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
She can make a video, but this time, make the dog the centre of attention.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
In case you haven't noticed, Brooke isn't a very interesting person.

17:52.000 --> 17:58.000
This could easily be proven back in the day when she had to rely on the craziness of her stories and clickbait to coast on views.

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
And when she uploaded other videos that weren't actually so focused on that, well, her views weren't tippy-top.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
So in an attempt to revive her channel, she seemed to alter the perspective of the title,

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
and the video from herself to her pet Doberman, named Sphinx.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
This was a good concept, and the video was nice.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
It was well cut, and it carried a lot of energy.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
Arguably, this was one of the best ideas that Brooke had for a while,

18:19.000 --> 18:26.000
especially considering that regardless of the level of their success, her true crime videos were almost certainly demonetised.

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
This video was called Day in the Life of a Doberman Puppy, and well, it did what it said in the tin.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
No active deception occurring there either.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
So we have the perfect combination, ad-friendly content that people wanted to watch.

18:38.000 --> 18:45.000
The formula was right, and finally, for the first time in months, people were tuning in en masse to view content all eyes on Brooke.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
What would she do next? Well, what she always knew best.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
Milk it, milk it, milk it until it's dry.

18:53.000 --> 18:59.000
On top of this, ever since her quote, refresh phase, she'd adopted this minimalist matter-of-fact star titling,

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
which I guess was meant to convey that sort of Emma Chamberlain candidness.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
I don't really buy it, and once again, with the follow-up videos for her dog,

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
they were kind of exaggerated to almost parody levels,

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
as if she was preparing for the inevitable controversy herself.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
A very honest video, my real morning routine.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
Every time she is rebranded, she wants to present it as her real self,

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
but all it revealed to me was a content chameleon trying to be recognised,

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
and throwing various ideas at the wall, and then spamming them when it stuck.

19:30.000 --> 19:35.000
And that's not healthy, not productive, and only plays into a cycle when that inevitably dies.

19:35.000 --> 19:41.000
The only way you can cope with that sort of mental strain is if you're completely void of any emotional connection to the content,

19:41.000 --> 19:47.000
which is also a terrible way to go about it, because then it doesn't matter how you actually feel about that content.

19:47.000 --> 19:53.000
All that matters is views, which will never fulfil you, because nothing like that will ever fully maintain itself.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
When you've had your chance to make some views, nothing really matters,

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
not even the resources that were the reason you had those views in the first place.

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
A lot of people only know about the fact that Brookhounds abused this dog,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
which was, on principle, bad enough.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
However, with the additional information that we have unearthed today,

20:14.000 --> 20:20.000
what we know is that this same dog was giving Brookhounds' dead channel a new lease of life.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
The dog actually revived her channel.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
This channel was built on a constant evolution of character,

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
and every change that she implemented didn't really show any hints of originality,

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
it just bit from other more successful formulas already held by other creators.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
That's the problem though, although she said in her video that she wanted to make content that she cared about,

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
I do wonder if she ever cared about any of the content she made, given the way she went about it.

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
Now, making follow up videos to a video that has done well is not rare,

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
in fact, many sensible businessmen may do that.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
I don't have any grudge against people who want to make the most of a successful video.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
However, there is a line, and if creating a video is either of great detriment to you,

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
or anyone around you, then you should definitely think twice.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
Unfortunately, Brook clearly doesn't have the capacity to think twice,

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
if we even grant her the capacity to think at all.

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
This is what I was saying at the start of the video about caring about your content.

21:15.000 --> 21:21.000
Unless it's really low effort, really lightweight, then you have to be invested in the actual creation of it,

21:21.000 --> 21:26.000
and what it took to get there, and not just the views it may yield, as exciting as they are.

21:26.000 --> 21:31.000
Because if that's the case, then I do believe you begin to fall out of touch with your own humanity,

21:31.000 --> 21:38.000
just mindlessly churning out what works, and if Brook was ever humane at all, then she clearly lost that grip.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
I don't know what on earth she was thinking, even considering uploading that video to YouTube.

21:42.000 --> 21:48.000
I know she didn't intentionally put it public, but the fact that it even had the possibility of being exposed,

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
almost seems like the perfect karma for what she actually did in the video.

21:52.000 --> 21:57.000
As mentioned earlier, the video shows her behaving extremely aggressively to a dog,

21:57.000 --> 22:02.000
behaving fairly unexceptionally, in many ways in an extremely friendly and affectionate manner.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
The video is particularly bad, and I'll tell you why.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
Because you have someone who may react in the moment to a pet catching them off guard,

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
or pissing them off, and although the reaction would still not be justified,

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
they have the brief moment to snap out of any rage that they may be in at that point.

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
Brook's behaviour was extremely confrontational and incessant,

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
to the point where she had the chance to think about how she was treating her dog.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
She actively pursues it, and persists in abusive behaviour against it.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
There is very little dispute about what actually happened in the video.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
It's clear that she makes physical contact with the animal,

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
and yells at the dog at multiple points in an extremely aggressive manner.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
The only thing that seems to be in any dispute, is the claim that she spat on her dog.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
And even then, it's a minority, mostly comprised of Brook and her fans.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
Unfortunately for Brook, that view was just too incriminating for there to be any real denial.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
She moves her head in a way, and makes a sound that resembles spitting.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
People are gonna call a spade a spade, as if the video wasn't bad enough as it was.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
It's nasty, and you'd think she'd treat any pet with dignity,

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
let alone one that has actually brought her success that she could not provide herself.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
I think the dog should receive its own YouTube channel, to be honest.

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
What were the motives for doing this? I mean, I've watched enough of Brookhounds' content now,

23:22.000 --> 23:27.000
and I don't think she necessarily did it for pleasure, she didn't seem to be taking much enjoyment in it.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
Although you really have to be quite a nasty person, or ready to be capable of this,

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
I would still probably expect a greater circumstantial motive.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
What that is, I don't know, but I do know the dog should not be in her possession,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
I think that's a pretty open and shut case.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
If she is capable of doing that on camera, then heaven knows what she might be capable of doing off camera.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
And often, I do think in some cases, people shouldn't necessarily lose their pets,

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
if I think that what they were doing was just incredibly ill-thought out, like I did with Alinity.

23:54.000 --> 24:00.000
But the absolute visceral hatred in Brook's eyes, I mean, it seemed like she genuinely resented the dog.

24:00.000 --> 24:05.000
To me, it just felt like she hated the fact that she had to make a video with this pet.

24:05.000 --> 24:10.000
She's clearly forcing herself through, regardless, there is no way she is enjoying this.

24:10.000 --> 24:15.000
In her video, she said she's gonna be pranking the dog, and at first I thought she was just pandering to the trends,

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
you know, combining dogs with pranks, epic style lol.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
But what if she saw it as a way to get back at the dog?

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
I mean, pranks typically involve targeting some individual, or putting them through something,

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
and it doesn't seem like the most benign of pranks.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
What's up everyone, it's your girl Brook here today.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
For this video, I wanted to prank my dog.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Shh, he's over there.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
I put plastic wrap on the door, I'm gonna have him run out, we're just gonna see what he does.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
I don't know.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
I doubt the dog will fully be able to understand the comedy side of it,

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
because normally when the prank's over, you know to explain it to the person,

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
and they laugh, or it's just fake and the other person's in on it regardless.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
Neither are particularly practical in this instance, when the subject is a dog.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
It makes me wonder if she does have some level of repressed hatred towards her dog

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
for basically becoming the star of her channel, which I know is a wacky theory,

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
but the amount of contempt generally seems like she loathes the dog,

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
and although there may be some other reason that we're not aware of,

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
there's nothing that can justify this.

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
She hits a dilemma, she either uploads a video with her dog and gains those views,

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
but sacrifices focus on her content on, you know, her,

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
or she tries to make videos about herself, has that feeling of validation,

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
but rescinding her child back to the era of, well, not the most overwhelming success.

25:26.000 --> 25:31.000
She chose success, but sacrificed the one thing she cared about herself.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
What if she was just angry she was losing her grip on that?

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Now that's just my theory, my perspective.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
I'm sure that I plethora.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
At the end of it all, theories and explanations are important,

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
because then we can work out the consequences for that person,

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
and also the motivations so that we can prevent it in the future.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
But as mentioned earlier, the consequences are pretty clear.

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
She is not fit to have a dog, whatever mentality she is in right now,

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
to hurt an animal as genuinely loyal, there's no two ways about it.

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
Regardless of theories, the conclusion doesn't change, so I won't dwell on it for much longer.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
However, as mentioned earlier, she responded,

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
and if there's one thing we love on the right opinion, it's a good response.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
But if there's one thing we love more, it's a bad one.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
Now, Brooke's career was already over.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
There was literally nothing that could save her YouTube channel.

26:26.000 --> 26:32.000
It was finished, done, ended, fini, closed the curtains, the fat lady is singing,

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
unless she had an evil doppelganger who was the product of a failed experimental project

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
take over from her and punish the dog.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
But that just sounds like a wacky film plot.

26:40.000 --> 26:45.000
Honestly, I was grudgingly impressed by the fact that she even put out a response,

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
but it doesn't make it good of course.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
Obviously, you have to ignore her first response, which thanks people for being understanding,

26:51.000 --> 26:57.000
which is unbelievably hilarious, as I don't think understanding is exactly the adjective I'd use to capture the moment.

26:57.000 --> 27:01.000
I mean, if she does genuinely feel their understanding, then their understanding of the situation

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
is that she deserves to face much harsher consequences than she has.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
When realising that people weren't quite as sympathetic towards her case as she thought they were,

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
she decided to put out a more lengthy statement addressing her little mishaps.

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
So, firstly, I hate to be pedantic, but when writing a formal apology,

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
try and get the spelling and grammar correct, please.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
I don't expect perfect spelling and grammar a lot of the time.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
Hell, I can't even expect it from my own editors half the time.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
But when you're writing a serious apology, get someone to read it through.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Read it through yourself, whatever perfects it.

27:33.000 --> 27:38.000
You want to make sure that you show yourself as taking this as seriously as possible,

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
so confusing affected with affected is not good.

27:42.000 --> 27:47.000
For those who aren't aware, affected with an A at the start implies a verb, a doing word.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
I affected your emotions.

27:50.000 --> 27:57.000
If you have an effect with an E as in a noun, then it would be you having an effect on someone.

27:57.000 --> 28:02.000
The only time you use affected with an E is when you've carried out something.

28:02.000 --> 28:08.000
So, for example, I affected a policy in which I sacked my editors for spelling words wrong.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
You see what I did there, editors? You see? Good.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
That's a side note.

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
Now, I've spoken about the aesthetics of apologies, but it means nothing in this instance.

28:24.000 --> 28:30.000
Unfortunately, for example, in my Pokemon video, I spoke about how it's important to frame your mental state.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
It's not exactly excusing your actions, but as explaining them.

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
If you can show your judgment as diminished to the point where it may lead you to make a bad call,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
people may be more forgiving.

28:40.000 --> 28:45.000
Brooke does actually employ this, but completely fails to recognize that she doesn't satisfy

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
the amount of diminished judgment that would be required to abuse your dog,

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
which is the key problem here.

28:51.000 --> 28:58.000
Having a bad week, having a bad month, having a bad year, having a bad decade does not justify her actions,

28:58.000 --> 29:03.000
and although she does acknowledge that, it does bring into contention why she's posting that at all.

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
Another problem with her response is that she seems to focus on the fact that she shouted,

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
and although the hostility was rightfully criticized by many people,

29:11.000 --> 29:17.000
I think people were also much more focused on the physical behavior exerted by our good friend Brooke here.

29:17.000 --> 29:23.000
However, to counter this, she refutes the notion that she is an abuser, stating that she did not physically put the dog in pain,

29:23.000 --> 29:30.000
or audibly put the dog in pain, I don't know how you audibly measure pain, I guess the dog didn't shout enough,

29:30.000 --> 29:36.000
but a dog doesn't have to scream for pain to be elicited, this seems like an extremely weak defense.

29:36.000 --> 29:41.000
She also disputes the claim that she spat on him, which once again is hard to argue with the glaring evidence,

29:41.000 --> 29:48.000
but if she genuinely feels that she didn't, well what can I say, it seems obvious, but what can she do?

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
She then goes into a fairly incoherent ramble about how she's sorting out the dog,

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
which implies the dog held some responsibility for provoking the response from Brooke.

29:57.000 --> 30:05.000
This is also referenced at the start of the response, where she says that it was necessary that she reacted in a way that enforced a sexual behavior,

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
such as not jumping up in your face with the mouth open.

30:08.000 --> 30:13.000
I mean, that is a pretty natural thing that many dogs do, unless it was occurring on an excessive basis,

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
then I don't think you need to take any action, let alone what you did.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
The whole talking about all the lessons the dog is taking just seems insulting really,

30:21.000 --> 30:26.000
when the spotlight is on what she can do as a dog owner to improve.

30:26.000 --> 30:31.000
Despite admitting that she's messed up, she doesn't seem to want to talk about what she's going to do to improve herself.

30:31.000 --> 30:37.000
Talking about untraining the dog so he doesn't provoke her again, I mean, that's just a bad look on her part,

30:37.000 --> 30:41.000
because it makes it seem like she's trying to avoid the situation provoking her reaction again,

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
which implies she doesn't have faith in her own patience.

30:44.000 --> 30:49.000
Now, of course, she does say briefly towards the end that she's going to be working on her own side,

30:49.000 --> 30:55.000
but I feel the whole there's two sides to this narrative doesn't work when the other side is a literal dog,

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
and we've already observed the actual side through the lens of a camera.

30:59.000 --> 31:04.000
The other thing that Brooke constantly turns to in this instance is the appeal to authority,

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
the idea that anyone who truly knows her knows that everything's fine,

31:08.000 --> 31:13.000
and she's a loving dog parent, which is a bad argument if no one's really willing to back it up themselves.

31:13.000 --> 31:18.000
On top of this, some people who claim to know you don't seem very favourable at all.

31:18.000 --> 31:23.000
Um, but me and Brooke had just a date about like two years ago, um, in this thing called Superpower Couple,

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
it was dumb, it was stupid, it was pointless.

31:25.000 --> 31:30.000
Uh, yeah, so she came to visit me in Florida for about a week, um, and just yet they're out there too,

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
she's vegan, and she did not shower one time while she was there,

31:33.000 --> 31:37.000
and we gave her all the necessities that she needed to shower, and she just did not do it.

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
My mom even said something to me. It was absolutely disgusting.

31:41.000 --> 31:45.000
Um, but I'm not here to talk about that, I'm here to talk about how she treated my dog.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Um, I have a minutestionality, she's small.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
Uh, she would throw my dog around as if it was a cat, and I didn't see anything of it at the time,

31:51.000 --> 31:57.000
but now that this dog stuff is coming out, it makes so much sense, uh, that she is not a fan of animals,

31:57.000 --> 32:02.000
or she just doesn't like to treat animals with the same respect as if you would treat a human being, you know?

32:02.000 --> 32:07.000
Um, but, uh, she didn't want the dog to sleep near us at all while she stayed there, or anything like that.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
It's very messed up, and I do not think she deserves that dog.

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
Now, he might have just said this for the clout for all I know, but it's risky business

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
saying that anyone who knows you will be on your side because then someone who knows you

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
who subsequently calls you out would invalidate your argument,

32:21.000 --> 32:26.000
unless you suddenly claim that they actually aren't your real friends, no true Scotsman style.

32:26.000 --> 32:31.000
She also makes the bold statement that anyone who has witnessed or heard animal abuse

32:31.000 --> 32:36.000
will be able to see that her behaviour did not actually fit the criteria of abuse.

32:36.000 --> 32:42.000
Once again, an awful thing to say, because you completely open yourself up to people with experience in the area

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
contradicting you, and then you just look like an idiot.

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
It also seems very manipulative, implying that if you've seen animal abuse,

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
then you must be able to see that this ain't the same.

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
The sad thing is, she seems so convinced that she's just out here doing her best,

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
and this small blip is something that she'll emerge from.

33:00.000 --> 33:04.000
It's not. As a statement, it seems like she wants to present more context,

33:04.000 --> 33:09.000
but saying, I'm the good guy, I promise, to a rabid horde of angry viewers doesn't work.

33:09.000 --> 33:14.000
She says she doesn't want to defend her actions, but there's no other way to look at this

33:14.000 --> 33:19.000
other than an attempt to explain or justify, she tries to act as a third person observer

33:19.000 --> 33:24.000
into this situation that she was directly involved in, as if she's the one fact checking and correcting.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
I'm sorry girl, you don't receive that liberty, you lost the game.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
As mentioned briefly at the start, she also released a video titled A Message For You.

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
She doesn't really add too much, other than stating that she's now volunteering at a shelter.

33:37.000 --> 33:45.000
I'm now a volunteer at a local animal welfare organization, and so I'm really happy and excited about that.

33:45.000 --> 33:54.000
And since the matter I have invested in professional dog training, I'm learning so much,

33:54.000 --> 34:01.000
and I promise you that my pet owner relationship is stronger than ever.

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
Good for her, I guess, but one of the really annoying things was this to me actually.

34:06.000 --> 34:13.000
Thank you for that, and I also want to apologize to anyone who was offended.

34:13.000 --> 34:20.000
It has never been and will never be my intention to hurt or offend anyone, ever.

34:20.000 --> 34:26.000
I'm not going to sit here and try to justify my actions, I'm just not going to do that.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
I really hate this phrase, it's one of my least favourite phrases.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.000
Why is she sorry if you were offended?

34:32.000 --> 34:37.000
For me, why is it so hard to just apologize for the action rather than the reaction?

34:37.000 --> 34:41.000
It's not like you said an edgy joke and someone may have taken it the wrong way.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
You actually made physical contact with a dog on camera.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Why is it so hard to take responsibility?

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
She also says she welcomes the discussion about this little incident.

34:50.000 --> 34:57.000
I want to say thank you to anyone who has reached out about this topic

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
or engaged in this discussion over the past month or so.

35:00.000 --> 35:05.000
I just want to genuinely say thank you because I think as a society,

35:05.000 --> 35:10.000
it is so important that we continue to talk about things we feel need to be talked about

35:10.000 --> 35:14.000
and discuss issues we feel need to be discussed.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
And I would love for you to get to know me.

35:16.000 --> 35:26.000
And for any YouTuber or other influencers or other public figures even who have commented on this situation,

35:26.000 --> 35:31.000
I pray, I pray that one day we can meet.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
Because I would love to show you who I really am

35:34.000 --> 35:39.000
and I would love to show you my true heart and personality.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
Once again with this tone as if she is the moderator of a debate

35:42.000 --> 35:47.000
rather than the subject of an animal abuse scandal, please give it a rest.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
You can say that you'd love to meet everyone who's made a video on you and changed their mind,

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
but the simple fact is you won't change their mind.

35:53.000 --> 35:57.000
People can pretend to be nice, you know, that was the point of why people have turned on you.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
I think many have seen enough.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
And that brings us to our final part.

36:12.000 --> 36:23.000
There are two simple points I want to emphasise here,

36:23.000 --> 36:26.000
that there is nothing wrong with presenting things from your perspective,

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
and there's nothing wrong with even correcting misconceptions,

36:29.000 --> 36:35.000
but you can't make it the centre of that when there are much greater claims to be addressed.

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
Brooke needs to understand that the video has done all the reputational damage

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
that cannot be rectified with a matter-of-fact response.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
There have definitely been worse responses,

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
but I think the problem was that there was no text response that could communicate

36:48.000 --> 36:53.000
the level of remorse that many would perceive as necessary to vindicate her,

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
maybe even no response at all.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
As said, I think it would have been a near impossible sell as it was,

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
and if she had shown too much emotion, it probably would have been seen as pity bait.

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
But there's still a balance, and you can't come in with a tone that says to people,

37:06.000 --> 37:10.000
you know, I really shouldn't shout it that way, but the dog was in my face,

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
and I was in a bad mood, and the dog has been acting up recently,

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
so we're gonna get it training, don't worry, it won't happen again,

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
anyone who really knows me knows this isn't how I normally act.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
Please don't take too many implications from it.

37:23.000 --> 37:28.000
Unfortunately for Brooke, leaked videos that aren't intended for the public eye

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
are probably the sort of content that people take the most implications from,

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
because at that point, you're not playing a character.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.000
In her response, she defends her regular persona,

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
that bubbly, friendly Brooke is her standard mood,

37:40.000 --> 37:44.000
but whether she was in a good or bad mood cannot really justify such actions.

37:44.000 --> 37:48.000
That's the point, we've all done irrational stuff when we're pissed off,

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
but there's a line for many people, and you know,

37:50.000 --> 37:54.000
a pet dog isn't just for the good days, but it's also for the bad days,

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
when we're feeling down, and when we're feeling down,

37:56.000 --> 38:00.000
we shouldn't try and force ourselves or our pets through another video

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
for the sake of ad revenue.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
Sit it out, spend some time with your dog,

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
your dog is meant to cheer you up when you're feeling bad.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
The video didn't just tell us about Brooke's mentality in the moment,

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
but to me it said a lot about her own perception of content creation,

38:14.000 --> 38:19.000
don't make content that under no circumstances you could see yourself caring about,

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
don't view sentient beings as view traffic,

38:22.000 --> 38:28.000
don't tell people that this is your honest, true videos if that is not the case,

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
and don't put it in your titles, I mean, how much more obvious could you be?

38:32.000 --> 38:37.000
We all know that people's lies, particularly when represented through the highlight reel of a vlog, are exaggerated,

38:37.000 --> 38:42.000
but we still like to imagine that the person has some investment in how they carry themselves,

38:42.000 --> 38:47.000
and we still like to imagine how they behave in less than ideal environments,

38:47.000 --> 38:52.000
behind the scenes, even if they're having a bad day, even if they make a bad call,

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
even if they lash out from time to time,

38:54.000 --> 38:59.000
there was nothing that could suddenly justify the sort of person that we observed in that video,

38:59.000 --> 39:03.000
and nothing that gave us the implications that she was like that at all,

39:03.000 --> 39:08.000
in her statement she said she wasn't trying to convince people who thought she was a bad person otherwise,

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
but I think that's definitely what she should have been trying to do,

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
it's all good saying I know myself kind of thing,

39:14.000 --> 39:19.000
but I think people believing you're a decent person is a good thing to communicate as well,

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
particularly when I'm pretty sure you've tried to convey that message through your content,

39:23.000 --> 39:28.000
unless she was implying that people who thought she was a bad person were just too unreasonable,

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
but I think that would be a rather unearned argument at this stage,

39:31.000 --> 39:35.000
I think it was a case that reasoning led people to believe you were a bad person,

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
but you know what, she is right to an extent, as mentioned earlier,

39:39.000 --> 39:43.000
there wasn't much she could have said at this stage that would have changed people's perception,

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
maybe she just did it as a public statement due to the impending police investigation,

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
maybe with everything considered it was the best thing to do,

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
however even with that considered it was a pretty poor statement because

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
police and authorities are swayed by emotional sentiments like remorse and regret too,

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
and she just overall fails to show that,

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
being able to blame circumstances may work when you're talking about a psycho hairdresser,

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
but not a bloody dog,

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
the whole statement just seems too distant from the situation itself,

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
and that distance is something that perhaps she's felt for too long,

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
we've all had the case where we ask ourselves why we're doing YouTube,

40:18.000 --> 40:23.000
that sort of existential crisis that will eventually be answered when we find our creative flair,

40:23.000 --> 40:29.000
but I was constantly asking myself why Brooke was doing YouTube when watching her content,

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
and there's nothing wrong with doing a variety of content,

40:32.000 --> 40:37.000
but from the start it constantly seemed like a grapple with trends that were so fleeting and insubstantial

40:37.000 --> 40:41.000
that they could never yield the lasting success that Brooke clearly aspired for,

40:41.000 --> 40:46.000
and every time something did work she'd maximise it and then it'd die,

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
and she'd be back to square one, and this time the dog revived her channel,

40:49.000 --> 40:54.000
in some ways that would be an inspiring tale for someone who sees the interaction as a positive outcome,

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
but her behaviour wasn't of someone who genuinely appreciated that,

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
it was the same sort of rancid entitlement that pervaded some of her earlier storytimes,

41:02.000 --> 41:07.000
storytimes really do appeal to the inner narcissist because it's talking about yourself,

41:07.000 --> 41:12.000
and unlike other storytimes like animation which can appeal to artistic creativity,

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
it's all about number one,

41:14.000 --> 41:20.000
one of the things I noticed was that out of a ten minute video Brooke would sometimes spend two or three minutes just talking about herself,

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
and at first I thought she was just filling up the runtime to insert the mid-rolls,

41:24.000 --> 41:29.000
but maybe she's literally that self-obsessed, she talks about this a lot of the time as well.

41:29.000 --> 41:34.000
You can't not watch storytime videos, I don't know, or at least maybe that's just me,

41:34.000 --> 41:39.000
maybe I'm just weird and have an addiction like that, but I really love storytime videos,

41:39.000 --> 41:46.000
I don't think I've ever done an intro so fast, can we just applaud right now, like applause please, standing ovation,

41:46.000 --> 41:53.000
like let me hear it, oh calm down, let me hear it, no it's okay, no come on bring it on, wow I'm so annoying, literally I'm so sorry,

41:53.000 --> 41:58.000
I like how I'm not even acknowledging the fact that I look like literal ass right now,

41:58.000 --> 42:03.000
not figuratively literal ass, like literally, like what, like what is happening?

42:03.000 --> 42:08.000
Caring is important, and it's clear that Brooke cared about something,

42:08.000 --> 42:13.000
but it wasn't the content, it wasn't the output, it was a status that she constantly chased,

42:13.000 --> 42:19.000
and whatever motivation for her cruel, spiteful behaviour towards a dog who was so clearly loyal to her,

42:19.000 --> 42:24.000
it's clear that what she cared about was greater than the content she was creating at the time.

42:24.000 --> 42:31.000
If I was revealed to not actually believe a lot of my opinions, if I was revealed to actually love a bit of dog on dog,

42:31.000 --> 42:34.000
then I think people would have the right to feel misled,

42:34.000 --> 42:39.000
these videos were meant to be honest snapshots of a person or dog's life, but they weren't,

42:39.000 --> 42:45.000
and the one time we see something that we're not meant to see, it's unbelievably, viscerally negative,

42:45.000 --> 42:50.000
and it wasn't even leaked by someone who may be trying to bias that perception, it was Brooke herself,

42:50.000 --> 42:58.000
she made a career of being exaggerative and being fake, it's only ironic that her one moment of honesty is her downfall.

42:58.000 --> 43:04.000
Brooke's career as a YouTuber I think is over, her status as a dog owner is hopefully over now too,

43:04.000 --> 43:10.000
but I'd always use these situations as a message to audiences, and even friends and family of these people,

43:10.000 --> 43:15.000
to make sure those you support are real, genuinely care about these things.

43:15.000 --> 43:21.000
I know it's hard to judge, and I'm not saying we can often do that, but when it is exposed, hold them to a standard,

43:21.000 --> 43:27.000
because when you don't know what someone's really like and you give them something that they want to keep at all costs,

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
then this can happen.

43:29.000 --> 43:34.000
They'll do it when they're feeling good, when they're feeling bad, and regardless of who gets hurt,

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
even if it's man's best friend.

43:43.000 --> 43:50.000
So yes, that was the video, I want to give a big shoutout to my editors who've once again probably done a fantastic,

43:50.000 --> 43:56.000
legendary job, I'm going to leave their links in the pinned comment and send them all the love they deserve.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Fantastic, fantastic people.

43:58.000 --> 44:04.000
I'd also like to give a big thanks to my Patreons, the $10 Patreons are up on screen right now,

44:04.000 --> 44:11.000
I have to thank my $50 Patreons personally though, and that is Sumhala Baloo, The Specter Angel,

44:11.000 --> 44:19.000
Bowright, Nico Deschamps, Sarah Elizabeth, and Caroline. Fantastic, thank you so much, it really makes a difference.

44:19.000 --> 44:27.000
I'd also like to extend a very special thanks to my $100 Patreons, Brandon, Adam Michael, and Christopher Carrasse.

44:27.000 --> 44:31.000
Thank you so much, I can't express it enough, you know, it makes a whole lot of difference.

44:31.000 --> 44:36.000
If you want to hit me up on Twitter, I'm at The Right Opinion, Facebook The Right Opinion Official,

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
and my Discord will be in the pinned comment too.

44:39.000 --> 44:47.000
I have a new Instagram, I'm trying to use Instagram, honestly, I'm a bit confused by it, not because I'm a boomer, I promise,

44:47.000 --> 44:53.000
mainly because I guess it's for people whose lives are interesting, and my life just isn't interesting.

44:53.000 --> 45:00.000
I feel bad for saying that, I'm probably the most interesting aspect about my own life, and that's only because I'm a bit insane.

45:00.000 --> 45:06.000
I don't think I have too much else to add, I hope you guys are having a decent week, I'll send my love as always,

45:06.000 --> 45:10.000
and I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you in the next one.

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
Thanks for watching!
