00:00.000 --> 00:08.880
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too

00:08.880 --> 00:09.880
much free time.

00:09.880 --> 00:13.300
And when people ask me what inspired me to start YouTube, if I was to list off channels

00:13.300 --> 00:17.280
that served as motivation for my YouTube career, Channel Awesome and most notably Doug Walker,

00:17.280 --> 00:19.700
aka The Nostalgia Critic, was one of them.

00:19.700 --> 00:23.000
Every Tuesday night, I grab a takeaway and pull up my laptop and watch his latest review

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
in almost a ritualistic manner, and that habit has continued up until this day.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.160
Even though I'm not unconditionally in love with his content, it's hard to deny they've

00:30.160 --> 00:33.560
brought me gems like Sharkboy and Lavagirl that I'll be chuckling for days following,

00:33.560 --> 00:37.480
and I don't laugh at much these days, so for someone as emotionally soulless as me to have

00:37.480 --> 00:41.720
that sort of content to at least entertain the vacuum was meaningful, and I've learned

00:41.720 --> 00:45.400
a lot about cinema through the indirect messages often portrayed in their episodes.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.840
It's often clever commentary.

00:46.840 --> 00:49.560
I found out about The Nostalgia Critic through that guy with the glasses.

00:49.560 --> 00:54.080
I cannot exactly say how that happened, we're talking about approximately 2011 when I discovered

00:54.080 --> 00:57.600
their content, so bringing specifics into my memory is a challenge to say the least.

00:57.600 --> 01:01.400
Though I will say that I also discovered two other critics, Todd In The Shadows and The

01:01.400 --> 01:04.560
Rat Critic in quick succession, although I'm not sure in which order.

01:04.560 --> 01:08.280
But much alike to the NC, they are two critics whom I still watch to this day.

01:08.280 --> 01:11.600
I'm not going to enter too much depth, but I assume it's a story that you already know

01:11.600 --> 01:15.280
by now, but that guy with the glasses was set up by a partnership between Doug Walker

01:15.280 --> 01:17.680
and a few other people that we'll get to in a moment.

01:17.680 --> 01:21.960
This was done in light of the very stringent copyright rules regarding YouTube and a situation

01:21.960 --> 01:25.560
with regards to his Five Second Movies, and it's covered in a nice little article that

01:25.560 --> 01:26.560
I will link below.

01:26.560 --> 01:30.120
I know the fair use debate or not is quite contentious, and it's fairly subjective.

01:30.120 --> 01:33.840
It's the sort of comedic cutting that came into contention earlier this year with Sargon

01:33.840 --> 01:37.720
of Akkad and Akkila, obviously, but either way, hosting videos on Blip and using their

01:37.720 --> 01:42.000
domain as a way to embed their content, they decided it would be reasonable to host a numerous

01:42.000 --> 01:43.440
selection of creators as well.

01:43.440 --> 01:45.600
But wait a minute, I hear you say, who are they?

01:45.600 --> 01:47.400
Well, let's talk about the main characters.

01:47.400 --> 01:51.140
We've got Doug Walker, who we've already introduced, his brother Rob Walker, and a

01:51.140 --> 01:53.060
third individual named Mike Michaud.

01:53.060 --> 01:56.660
The two other individuals were Mike Elish and Bhargav Drom and Raju, the latter of which

01:56.660 --> 01:59.620
there isn't too much to say and the former of whom we'll address later.

01:59.620 --> 02:03.620
Now, if you're thinking to yourself, huh, I've never heard of Michaud, don't worry,

02:03.620 --> 02:06.860
I hadn't heard of him either until a couple weeks before the memo, when I coincidentally

02:06.860 --> 02:11.180
found myself on their Wikipedia page, briefly before the document in question was released.

02:11.180 --> 02:15.140
I remember thinking to myself, I've never heard of this bloke, what does he do?

02:15.140 --> 02:20.060
Well, things, he does things, things that we'll address very soon.

02:20.100 --> 02:24.020
I was having a discussion with Quinton Reviews over this before the documents were released.

02:24.020 --> 02:27.940
We had both noted how many creators had left abruptly and seemingly with little notice.

02:27.940 --> 02:30.100
We'd wondered about the explanations for such decisions.

02:30.100 --> 02:35.500
Well, on April the 2nd, after rumbles of activity, we received their full side of the story.

02:35.500 --> 02:39.520
The document itself is an approximately 70-page condemnation of Channel Awesome and their

02:39.520 --> 02:42.340
questionable behaviour and incidents that resulted due to it.

02:42.340 --> 02:46.260
Now, I'm someone who always looks into such claims with an element of scepticism.

02:46.260 --> 02:50.020
It's an integral part of my philosophy because if I didn't, then I think that such an approach

02:50.020 --> 02:53.940
could easily be exploited by people with malintent, although I do completely comprehend

02:53.940 --> 02:55.340
that it's a tender subject.

02:55.340 --> 02:59.900
Even with that said, the sheer number of corroborating testimonies and accounts makes it hard to

02:59.900 --> 03:00.900
dispute to say the least.

03:00.900 --> 03:03.560
Saying any of it is purposely falsified at all is a push.

03:03.560 --> 03:06.700
They persuaded me over the benefit of the doubt line for Channel Awesome.

03:06.700 --> 03:10.780
I've read all 70 pages and it definitely seems like there's a strong element of truth to it.

03:10.780 --> 03:13.460
The document had a few purposes from an outsider's perspective.

03:13.460 --> 03:17.220
The first was to challenge the images of certain public representatives, most notably Doug

03:17.220 --> 03:18.220
and Rob Walker.

03:18.220 --> 03:21.780
Walker is presented as a naive visionary who was blinded by his own apparitions and was

03:21.780 --> 03:26.280
often complicit in too many things, while Rob is portrayed as a socially unaware, disinterested

03:26.280 --> 03:27.940
and occasionally callous figure.

03:27.940 --> 03:31.780
Now obviously these moments are spotlighting the worst incidents that have occurred, however

03:31.780 --> 03:33.900
this does not denigrate their existence.

03:33.900 --> 03:37.260
Nonetheless it's clear that there are still people who have had positive experiences with

03:37.260 --> 03:40.740
the Walkers and I'll try and investigate this divide in a bit, however we have a bit

03:40.740 --> 03:44.580
more explanation to cut through before we start to dissect this very sorry situation.

03:44.940 --> 03:49.060
Yes, the real story comes when discussing the company's CEO Mike Michaud, now if there's

03:49.060 --> 03:53.220
someone who came out with less than a flattering image, it would be the elusive majority stakeholder

03:53.220 --> 03:54.340
in the business.

03:54.340 --> 03:57.980
The document has multiple individuals who testify that his behaviour was less than adequate

03:57.980 --> 04:01.260
and once again I'm not going to go into specifics as that's already done in the document,

04:01.260 --> 04:05.360
but allegations include bullying, coercion, throwing fits, ignoring a scandal, failing

04:05.360 --> 04:09.180
to act on concern, favouritism and shafting creators he did not like.

04:09.180 --> 04:11.180
And that's really just the tip of the iceberg.

04:11.180 --> 04:14.520
He doesn't come across as a pleasant fellow to say the least, and although evidence is

04:14.520 --> 04:18.480
not provided to substantiate every claim, there is definitely enough, including an actual

04:18.480 --> 04:22.600
audio clip, albeit a short one, which shows him actively exiling a creator from returning

04:22.600 --> 04:25.640
to the site, while also having signalled no intent to inform him.

04:25.640 --> 04:29.840
There are a fair few DMs of him behaving rather coldly, and some just of him not responding

04:29.840 --> 04:33.600
at all to necessary messages, although none of his supposed eruptions are recorded, I

04:33.600 --> 04:37.920
do not doubt the legitimacy of the claims, either way his name is not shrouded in glory

04:37.920 --> 04:41.180
throughout what is written, and on top of that it appears that he has channel awesome

04:41.180 --> 04:45.500
in a stranglehold where he has partial license over the Nostalgia Critic, Doug Walker's

04:45.500 --> 04:46.500
lifeline.

04:46.500 --> 04:49.940
Now if this information is true, which I have no reason to believe it otherwise, it places

04:49.940 --> 04:53.980
Doug in a very awkward ultimatum, where the main source of his income is partly in the

04:53.980 --> 04:58.660
hands of someone who can practically do anything he wants, and given the illustration of this

04:58.660 --> 05:02.420
character, he isn't the sort of person you'd want to entrust such a responsibility with.

05:02.420 --> 05:06.060
This theory intertwines fairly well with the memo, with situations where it appears that

05:06.060 --> 05:09.900
Doug was trying to act as a person to mediate, but still side with the business, with the

05:09.900 --> 05:14.140
business becoming synonymous with the CEO in question, but keeping all this information

05:14.140 --> 05:18.540
in mind, we have to ask ourselves what can be learned from this situation, what can we

05:18.540 --> 05:32.380
learn from Channel Awesome?

05:32.380 --> 05:36.380
Now in a way, what is written in the memo is fairly unexceptional to me, I've worked

05:36.380 --> 05:40.420
five jobs in my life, two of them tried to swindle money out of me when I left, and another

05:40.420 --> 05:43.940
had an adverse and unpredictable boss who was not good to work around.

05:43.940 --> 05:47.700
A lot of the stories told in the Not-Saucer memo focus on that sort of environment, one

05:47.700 --> 05:51.220
that many of you watching this video have probably experienced within employment.

05:51.220 --> 05:55.140
So although there is more, why is it necessary that they document topics that appear to be

05:55.140 --> 05:57.900
part of what you deal with when getting into a job?

05:57.900 --> 06:00.900
Well it's mainly to challenge the public perception above all.

06:00.900 --> 06:04.380
Channel Awesome or That Guy With The Glasses was always presented as this community, this

06:04.380 --> 06:09.300
group of people who were getting along and having fun, all mates, Doug the benign overlord

06:09.300 --> 06:13.140
and the management who had you in their interest, many people wanted to join.

06:13.140 --> 06:16.860
I mean even when I present it like that, you'd think it's far fetched, but that's the default

06:16.860 --> 06:20.740
thing we have when we think of the platforms challenging the YouTube mentality, but at

06:20.740 --> 06:24.020
the end of the day, it seems that Channel Awesome was just another shell.

06:24.020 --> 06:28.300
That's not particularly special, but we have this subconscious expectation of what CA should

06:28.300 --> 06:30.340
be, and here is the alternate take.

06:30.340 --> 06:34.260
This doesn't shock me at all, it's not something that is alien to me in fact, it's just a

06:34.260 --> 06:38.540
shame that if it's true, a few bad apples, maybe even just the one, spoiled the whole

06:38.540 --> 06:42.220
bunch, and ruined what could have been a genuinely surreal experience.

06:42.220 --> 06:46.940
As a CEO, you often have to make tough decisions, with an element of ruthlessness to them.

06:46.940 --> 06:51.620
CEOs have the highest representative proportion of psychopaths and sociopaths in those occupations,

06:51.620 --> 06:52.940
in part for that reason.

06:52.940 --> 06:57.380
Now I'm not saying that Michaud in this instance is a psychopath, but the revelation of a CEO

06:57.380 --> 07:01.940
being particularly merciless is not a surprise to me either, and once again I emphasise that

07:01.940 --> 07:06.660
not all the claims are completely substantiated, so I don't take them as a certainty, however

07:06.660 --> 07:11.340
circumstantially what is written is very plausible given business and staff practice in general,

07:11.340 --> 07:14.820
the fact that there are people who we might think we know through their content is irrelevant.

07:14.820 --> 07:18.860
However, whereas many businesses there is a stake in the employees, there was very little

07:18.860 --> 07:22.700
worth in that guy with the glasses, you see, they didn't take a stake in the income made

07:22.700 --> 07:26.780
by the individual producers, and although this on principle may sound good to them,

07:26.780 --> 07:30.900
it means that they were just promotional instruments, and therefore if their promotional value was

07:30.900 --> 07:34.180
diminished, the management had free reign to strike them off as they pleased.

07:34.180 --> 07:37.860
I think these loose working relationships were always destined to fail, especially if

07:37.860 --> 07:40.300
one fell out of favour with someone like Michaud.

07:40.300 --> 07:43.100
There was no binding contract, there was no legality.

07:43.100 --> 07:46.420
Unless you were actually employed, there was not really much you could do in the way of

07:46.420 --> 07:50.740
injustices, you're always walking a tightrope, and I think that's where the apparent contradiction

07:50.740 --> 07:54.700
came in, there were clearly people who wanted to make Channel Awesome into this community,

07:54.700 --> 07:58.100
the films, the collabs, but when it came down to it, there were others who weren't part

07:58.100 --> 08:00.380
of that who could also pull the plug as they wished.

08:00.380 --> 08:04.300
And again, having a rift in the vision of management would rarely be conducive to create

08:04.300 --> 08:06.980
a wellbeing, especially when no resolve is clear.

08:06.980 --> 08:11.180
I don't like a lot of businesses, that's why being self-employed isn't ideal for me.

08:11.180 --> 08:15.040
The moment you relinquish control of what you truly want to do is the moment it becomes

08:15.040 --> 08:17.700
a lot harder to realise your creative visions.

08:17.700 --> 08:21.220
And that's the thing, Channel Awesome didn't necessarily feel like a business, it's not

08:21.220 --> 08:24.940
an employer to many of these people, and in that way that should have put them at ease,

08:24.940 --> 08:28.900
but in fact it led to their positions becoming more insecure, and when someone like Michaud

08:28.900 --> 08:31.640
is around, you will always feel slightly fragile.

08:31.640 --> 08:35.620
Many of the things written about in the document are common occurrences in standard businesses,

08:35.620 --> 08:39.980
on YouTube even, I've seen my friends have their channels unjustifiably terminated, and

08:39.980 --> 08:43.700
although they were restored, it was not a pleasant experience for them.

08:43.700 --> 08:47.460
Channel Awesome was meant to be better than that, they presented themselves as better

08:47.460 --> 08:48.460
than that.

08:48.460 --> 08:51.580
I think that's the ultimate disappointment, that at the end of the day, it seems they

08:51.580 --> 08:55.700
were no different, and in almost a way to affirm this, they put out an awful tweet where

08:55.700 --> 08:58.540
they say that they regret that the producers feel this way.

08:58.580 --> 09:01.920
Now if you've watched my YouTube response to fellow humans, you'll know that I have

09:01.920 --> 09:06.060
no time for vague responses, and it doesn't become much vaguer than what was on show here.

09:06.060 --> 09:11.340
It is simple advice, if you feel that a response is insufficient, then maybe best to hold it

09:11.340 --> 09:15.540
off, because it's just self incriminating if you use phrases like, we regret that you

09:15.540 --> 09:16.540
feel that way.

09:16.540 --> 09:18.060
What's that even meant to imply?

09:18.060 --> 09:22.620
It's a pathetic response, and listen, I understand that when such a blitz of criticisms ambushes

09:22.620 --> 09:25.780
you, it's hard to know exactly how to respond, it's never easy.

09:25.780 --> 09:31.020
But there are ways not to respond, and congratulations CA, you have perfectly executed how not to

09:31.020 --> 09:32.020
respond.

09:32.020 --> 09:36.220
And then came their second response, and this one was meant to answer the allegations directly,

09:36.220 --> 09:38.640
once again it was insufficient and subjective.

09:38.640 --> 09:42.500
My favourite part was how they responded to former staff member Holly Brown by just saying

09:42.500 --> 09:46.540
that her allegations are not true, but not explaining why they weren't true, or presenting

09:46.540 --> 09:49.780
an alternative version of events, which would be necessary.

09:49.780 --> 09:54.940
The accusation being listed as Holly Brown makes numerous accusations is not even remotely

09:54.940 --> 09:57.040
logical, do you even PR?

09:57.040 --> 10:01.620
It also stated that they could quote obviously not respond to the 73 pages of allegation,

10:01.620 --> 10:04.520
yes you could, if it would help your case, you should.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.700
They claim they are going to answer the most egregious ones but don't even mention the

10:07.700 --> 10:12.540
allegation that Michaud bullied a producer into a suicidal mindset, that one seemed pretty

10:12.540 --> 10:13.780
inflammatory if you ask me.

10:13.780 --> 10:17.400
I know there may be some other responses by the time this video is out, however my prediction

10:17.400 --> 10:21.240
is that they will not satisfy people, as the only way to truly respond would be to present

10:21.240 --> 10:25.040
alternate perspectives in each experience, and no one seems willing to do that.

10:25.040 --> 10:29.080
And although I don't like writing at extra points last minute, I was just rerunning over

10:29.080 --> 10:31.720
their second response and it's even worse than I thought.

10:31.720 --> 10:35.440
For example, their first point is how they claim the screenshots they provided show they

10:35.440 --> 10:38.940
dealt with the issue within three weeks, when all it shows is that there were three weeks

10:38.940 --> 10:43.320
in between two conversations around the issue, and anyone could have been aware of it before

10:43.320 --> 10:44.320
then.

10:44.320 --> 10:47.200
How they think this is definitive counter evidence is beyond me and people will see

10:47.200 --> 10:49.960
through it, and people have seen through it.

10:49.960 --> 10:53.520
It couldn't be more corporate if it tried, and that's the issue, and that's why this

10:53.520 --> 10:56.000
document is often focused on image.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.200
Doug Walker is not Channel Awesome, he is Channel Awesome's PR, he is Channel Awesome's

11:00.200 --> 11:04.720
presenter, and what really goes on behind the scenes is not done in the community spirit.

11:04.720 --> 11:08.840
To that, you might argue, they have no obligation to, and you are completely right, they are

11:08.840 --> 11:13.560
not obliged to behave in their producers best interests, but in a way, that's accepted

11:13.560 --> 11:15.080
as premise in this.

11:15.080 --> 11:19.840
What the document was more about was people falsely believing that it is a creator-focused

11:19.840 --> 11:20.840
platform.

11:20.840 --> 11:24.120
Now of course, there were some more exceptional situations, such as the sexual harassment

11:24.120 --> 11:28.200
issues with former executive Mike Ellis, but the document doesn't necessarily focus on

11:28.200 --> 11:32.960
him more on Michaud's reaction to Ellis' behaviour, which appears to be passive to say the least.

11:32.960 --> 11:37.480
As Ellis is not an incumbent member of management, to focus a document on a departed member would

11:37.480 --> 11:41.480
clearly undermine the intended relevance, even if it's based off old events, there are

11:41.480 --> 11:43.880
still people currently in the loop.

11:43.880 --> 11:47.480
Channel Awesome is a business, many of the allegations do not surprise me, we will talk

11:47.480 --> 11:49.080
about the more serious ones soon.

11:49.080 --> 11:53.520
However, the reason why this document surprised a lot of people, despite the mostly unremarkable

11:53.520 --> 11:58.640
claims is because it contradicts the image, and images everything to a lot of these people.

11:58.640 --> 12:03.280
So for such damning claims to come against the quote, good guys, is more shocking than

12:03.280 --> 12:07.880
if someone complained about YouTube employees being mean to them, because Channel Awesome

12:07.880 --> 12:13.280
were meant to be better, and they wanted to be better, and they presented themselves as

12:13.280 --> 12:19.560
better.

12:19.560 --> 12:24.160
In her testimony, former administrator Holly Brown wrote that the Walkers didn't know Michaud

12:24.160 --> 12:26.480
and his associates until they approached him.

12:26.480 --> 12:30.560
Now the way Brown presents it makes it look like Michaud just turned up on Walker's doorstep,

12:30.560 --> 12:35.520
now I cannot say it was to that degree, however it did seem to be a fairly spontaneous business

12:35.520 --> 12:40.400
venture, and if true, this is bad business practice, and we're gonna use my Discord as

12:40.400 --> 12:41.400
an example.

12:41.400 --> 12:45.240
I ran a few servers in my time, and if there's two things I've learned, it's firstly, never

12:45.240 --> 12:49.520
give someone an administrator role just because they're your friends, and secondly, never

12:49.520 --> 12:52.940
give someone an administrator role just because they asked for it.

12:52.940 --> 12:53.940
Why is that?

12:53.940 --> 12:57.680
Well the latter in this example is particularly important, because if someone is interested

12:57.680 --> 13:01.960
in working for me and they just straight up ask, it is not grounds to sign away, no matter

13:01.960 --> 13:06.360
how intent they may seem at the time, even if they have a plethora of reasons for why

13:06.360 --> 13:07.360
you should.

13:07.360 --> 13:11.380
The issue is that someone consciously trying to attain a role often means they don't present

13:11.380 --> 13:15.620
themselves as who they are, especially if such effort is exerted over a short amount

13:15.620 --> 13:16.620
of time.

13:16.620 --> 13:20.240
The way Brown presents it implies that Michaud and his mates pretty much turned up and got

13:20.240 --> 13:21.240
the job.

13:21.240 --> 13:23.900
I can't say whether it's true or not, but that is how it is presented.

13:23.900 --> 13:27.100
Now when he turned up he may have looked the part, and I understand that, in the moment

13:27.100 --> 13:30.940
he might have seemed like the perfect candidate for the position, but human beings just do

13:30.940 --> 13:32.100
not work like that.

13:32.100 --> 13:35.540
You really have to see firstly how they perform when they think someone isn't looking, and

13:35.540 --> 13:39.580
also how they perform over a longer stretch of time, how much they're willing to put in

13:39.580 --> 13:40.700
for that next step.

13:40.700 --> 13:44.560
You have to measure that genuine commitment rather than what may be masqueraded.

13:44.560 --> 13:48.460
When I made my Discord server I approached a majority of admins from previous servers

13:48.460 --> 13:52.120
and offered them the role, because I knew them from their own performances and I knew

13:52.120 --> 13:53.900
that they weren't expecting that.

13:53.900 --> 13:57.460
Now that's not possible for every occupation, and obviously someone would always have to

13:57.460 --> 14:02.020
anticipate taking the role of CEO, but you can't just sign it away to the first person

14:02.020 --> 14:06.180
who comes to you, that's playing with fire, and in this instance it seems multiple people

14:06.180 --> 14:07.180
got burned.

14:07.180 --> 14:10.400
And although I will not be integrating an excessive number of personal observations,

14:10.400 --> 14:14.340
I must say that the original That Guy With The Glasses website layout became outdated

14:14.340 --> 14:18.340
very quickly, and the team appear to lack any distinguishing expertise that might give

14:18.340 --> 14:22.060
them an appeal that may compensate for them behaving less than respectfully.

14:22.060 --> 14:25.980
What I'm saying is that even if they were a dodgy lot they may have a unique skillset,

14:25.980 --> 14:30.080
some redeeming quality that gave them grounds for hire, however that was just not on display

14:30.080 --> 14:33.860
when you went on the site, and judging by the numerous technical criticisms, it was

14:33.860 --> 14:36.660
not on display in other areas as well.

14:36.660 --> 14:40.660
Unfortunately there are a fair few sly dogs who can impress in a short term period but

14:40.660 --> 14:44.340
quickly turn into the sort of character that Miss Short is portrayed as, however whereas

14:44.340 --> 14:48.740
in my Discord I can quickly strike off who I decide unfit to handle such power, by having

14:48.740 --> 14:53.080
them as the majority shareholder and shared owner of the Nostalgia Critic IP, it frankly

14:53.080 --> 14:59.300
gave him an unhealthy amount of control, it's an inconceivable level of mishandling of responsibility,

14:59.300 --> 15:02.760
even if Miss Short is not the person he has made out to be in the document.

15:02.760 --> 15:06.380
The other concern is when you begin to involve numerous family or friends, which was quite

15:06.420 --> 15:10.580
uncommon in Channel Awesome, nepotism can become rife, as although it may not genuinely

15:10.580 --> 15:14.420
reflect who they are as people in general, having an affirmed bias towards people you

15:14.420 --> 15:17.100
might have an emotional connection with is very common.

15:17.100 --> 15:21.740
This does not necessarily guarantee bad management, but many often can make the false assumption

15:21.740 --> 15:26.060
that because there's a level of intimacy, that person may feel more obliged to you.

15:26.060 --> 15:29.740
This is true sometimes, but it's dependent on the presence of yourself.

15:29.740 --> 15:33.580
As demonstrated in the memo, it's conveyed the people assigned to the roles didn't want

15:33.580 --> 15:36.140
the job and were often absent from this post.

15:36.140 --> 15:37.860
This is not good, and here's why.

15:37.860 --> 15:41.380
In the absence of supervision, someone who is their friend or family member can firstly

15:41.380 --> 15:45.740
levy the trust of their word, and supervisors who do not want the job do not want the conflicts

15:45.740 --> 15:49.700
associated with it either, and will likely side with their friend or family member within

15:49.700 --> 15:54.220
disagreements, as disputes in the workplace would extend a lot further on a personal basis.

15:54.220 --> 15:58.140
Combined with this, the fact that the people in this situation already have considerable

15:58.140 --> 16:01.520
control in the workplace, it is a recipe for disaster.

16:01.520 --> 16:05.100
This is only inflamed by the fact that the producers were not bound by contract, so in

16:05.100 --> 16:07.380
disputes you could just pull them from the sites.

16:07.380 --> 16:10.500
In a way, I'm almost amazed more abuse didn't occur at the time.

16:10.500 --> 16:13.820
The culture created through the pretense of that guy with the glasses and the mentality

16:13.820 --> 16:18.340
adopted by the Walker brothers cultivated an ideal scenario for easy exploitation.

16:18.340 --> 16:19.980
It's almost stupendous.

16:19.980 --> 16:23.300
Regardless of what you think of the validity of the document at hand, there is something

16:23.300 --> 16:27.540
fundamentally worrying about the thought of handing over the IP and shares of an asset

16:27.540 --> 16:29.200
vital to your survival.

16:29.200 --> 16:30.620
That seems crazy to me.

16:30.620 --> 16:34.640
On the surface, it seems like disorganised, distant management, unfamiliar with the awful

16:34.680 --> 16:37.400
decisions they were making, with some truly rotten eggs.

16:37.400 --> 16:42.120
However, with that all said, everything irrational, everything immoral, has something that underlines

16:42.120 --> 16:45.640
it, a decision that may make sense at the time, and although we could say that Michaud

16:45.640 --> 16:49.240
is an unpleasant person with some degree of conviction, there's probably a lot more going

16:49.240 --> 16:52.160
on behind the scenes with regards to other characters in this story.

16:52.160 --> 16:55.920
If there's one thing I've learned is that even good people in bad environments can make

16:55.920 --> 16:57.320
dreadful decisions.

16:57.320 --> 17:01.140
Nonetheless, throughout the document, many of its authors retrospectively illustrate

17:01.140 --> 17:05.340
themselves as starry-eyed, naive individuals, willing to take some jabs for their idols,

17:05.340 --> 17:08.980
and all it takes in those situations is one slightly negative actor to take advantage

17:08.980 --> 17:09.980
of that.

17:09.980 --> 17:18.940
What message can be imparted from that onto the audience of this document?

17:18.940 --> 17:22.860
Now before anyone reacts and criticises me for such a general statement, I am aware it

17:22.860 --> 17:23.860
is a hyperbole.

17:23.860 --> 17:28.180
I am not saying that you should lock yourself up and never be afraid to interact with people

17:28.180 --> 17:29.180
you look up to.

17:29.180 --> 17:30.180
Not at all.

17:30.220 --> 17:32.220
There are certain environments in which this is perfectly reasonable.

17:32.220 --> 17:35.540
However, situations with Channel Awesome are a whole different ballpark.

17:35.540 --> 17:36.540
Why is that?

17:36.540 --> 17:38.860
Well, you're not just meeting someone, but you're working with someone.

17:38.860 --> 17:42.580
Under the premise of what can be construed as a business venture, firstly, you're almost

17:42.580 --> 17:44.780
certain to go beyond their public facade.

17:44.780 --> 17:47.100
That's not an inherently bad thing on principle.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.140
Sometimes it's good to see how someone really operates.

17:49.140 --> 17:53.540
However, businesses are by nature rooted in conflict, and situations like that of Channel

17:53.540 --> 17:54.940
Awesome are not uncommon.

17:54.940 --> 17:59.060
Nonetheless, what makes it unique is how many admire those like Doug Walker.

17:59.060 --> 18:00.380
Let me give you an example.

18:00.380 --> 18:04.460
Do Walmart employees join with an idolisation of Greg Penner or Doug McMillan?

18:04.460 --> 18:05.460
Let's just say it's unlikely.

18:05.460 --> 18:09.420
They'd probably join with a fonder view of internet sensation such as the yodelling kid.

18:09.420 --> 18:12.780
But the yodelling kid isn't in cahoots with human resources.

18:12.780 --> 18:13.780
That's the thing.

18:13.780 --> 18:16.820
You're partially in the vicinity of a public figure, and in fact, comparably, it could

18:16.820 --> 18:20.540
be considered quite intimate to the point where, even if you had a very minimal role,

18:20.540 --> 18:24.460
you still felt like you were in some form of contact with figureheads like Doug Walker.

18:24.460 --> 18:26.320
But I'd argue that's not a good thing.

18:26.320 --> 18:29.620
Producers naturally require hard decisions, and having your career damaged by someone

18:29.620 --> 18:31.720
who you admire can really be soul destroying.

18:31.720 --> 18:35.360
A lot of these producers came in with the expectation of what Channel Awesome would

18:35.360 --> 18:36.360
be.

18:36.360 --> 18:39.480
This unique community, as I said earlier, Channel Awesome was meant to be different.

18:39.480 --> 18:43.400
I know plenty of people who wanted to go and work there for the image that it had created.

18:43.400 --> 18:47.160
However, because of this public image, when many of the producers were subjected to what

18:47.160 --> 18:50.960
could be seen as maltreatment, they may have questioned it, may have placed blame on themselves,

18:50.960 --> 18:55.360
and maybe asked whether their perspective was just an outcome of their actions.

18:55.400 --> 18:59.640
Producers also felt fragile in their own positions, because Channel Awesome had complete prerogative

18:59.640 --> 19:03.580
to remove creators from the site whenever they wished, and producers could not try and

19:03.580 --> 19:06.520
challenge it, because there were no binding contracts.

19:06.520 --> 19:11.260
Channel Awesome isn't necessarily an employer, but in effect, that made the situation worse.

19:11.260 --> 19:15.120
It appears that Michaud came along with his own agenda and exploited producers and their

19:15.120 --> 19:17.600
admiration of Doug Walker to the maximum degree.

19:17.600 --> 19:21.600
And with the Nostalgia Critic IP partially under his belt, and the producers under his

19:21.600 --> 19:26.200
some, it led to the alleged subsequent bullying of creators, atop a lengthy silence even after

19:26.200 --> 19:27.520
many producers departed.

19:27.520 --> 19:31.560
However, to take down Michaud, many of these producers would also have to lightly confront

19:31.560 --> 19:35.460
their conflicting feelings about Walker and Channel Awesome, the fact that his content

19:35.460 --> 19:39.920
still brings joy to many people's lives, the respect for the content that he puts out,

19:39.920 --> 19:44.440
the question of how common these situations were, whether their situations were individual

19:44.440 --> 19:47.760
experiences, whether it's worth the risk considering the overlap in their fanbase.

19:47.760 --> 19:51.280
A lot of this yields from the fact that people wanted to look at an environment like Channel

19:51.280 --> 19:55.520
Awesome in a positive light, and only after years of deliberation and consultation could

19:55.520 --> 20:00.320
they create a remotely convincing image otherwise, one that people have undoubtedly disputed

20:00.320 --> 20:01.320
regardless.

20:01.320 --> 20:02.560
And that is fine.

20:02.560 --> 20:03.560
That is healthy.

20:03.560 --> 20:07.100
I'm not guaranteeing that everything in this document is 100% accurate.

20:07.100 --> 20:10.800
If you want to question the validity in search of the truth, then more power to you.

20:10.800 --> 20:14.240
But either way, there is a lot at stake for creators in this, leaving and subsequently

20:14.240 --> 20:18.600
condemning a platform that, in spite of the allegations, has contributed a lot to their

20:18.600 --> 20:19.600
career.

20:20.280 --> 20:24.120
But that can't alone undermine the written expectations of these people.

20:24.120 --> 20:27.760
When people say never meet your heroes, that statement alone is reductionist.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.520
However, there's a reason why such an idiom exists.

20:30.520 --> 20:34.200
When we watch these people from afar, they may seem great, they may seem like the ideal

20:34.200 --> 20:36.360
people to have working relationships with.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.980
It's just not the case, and you have to approach it with the same caution that you'd approach

20:39.980 --> 20:41.940
any prospective opportunity with.

20:41.940 --> 20:45.120
When that opportunity presents itself, you should really question whether you want to

20:45.120 --> 20:47.280
put your own career in their hands.

20:47.280 --> 20:51.200
I've had the pleasure of working with people I've admired for a long time, but I've also

20:51.200 --> 20:53.640
been greatly disappointed by certain people.

20:53.640 --> 20:57.760
This disappointment is something that can magnify and manifest into many different emotions

20:57.760 --> 21:00.740
when you have the conditions the channel awesome presents.

21:00.740 --> 21:04.840
It doesn't mean they're bad people, but even if they're good people, they may make mistakes,

21:04.840 --> 21:08.760
they may involve bad people, and you might be at the receiving end of that.

21:08.760 --> 21:10.440
That could really taint your dreams.

21:10.440 --> 21:13.880
If you do find yourself in these situations, you have to put your innate bias towards these

21:13.880 --> 21:20.040
people aside, you have to look at the situation independently and separate your own expectations.

21:20.040 --> 21:23.120
Situational context matters, I cannot stress that enough.

21:23.120 --> 21:27.520
How good or bad characters like Doug or Rob Walker are is down for you to decide, but

21:27.520 --> 21:31.400
either way, if the situation is as it appears, they have made some awful mistakes, whether

21:31.400 --> 21:34.920
it's not understanding the environments for making a film, handing over their vision to

21:34.920 --> 21:39.140
someone with less than amiable intentions, or the numerous decisions that followed.

21:39.140 --> 21:42.920
Whether they are comfortable in that position, whether they were comfortable in that position,

21:42.920 --> 21:46.680
is regardless, they stayed in it, and that is the real shame.

21:46.680 --> 21:50.520
These decisions appear to come from a lack of guidance, a false sense of security, and

21:50.520 --> 21:55.100
supposed exploitation of the worst denominator, and a mechanism to perhaps try and justify

21:55.100 --> 21:57.480
these people's decisions in their heads.

21:57.480 --> 22:00.860
Michaud appears to be the villain of this tale, nonetheless, I would be intrigued to

22:00.860 --> 22:04.080
hear if the Walkers have anything to say about these allegations.

22:04.080 --> 22:07.780
Although they may not wish to respond, I feel that there are people still open to hearing

22:07.780 --> 22:11.120
them out, as they are not portrayed as irredeemable in the documents.

22:11.120 --> 22:15.520
To respond under the channelawesome banner with a pseudo-apology would be a grave mistake,

22:15.520 --> 22:19.880
but to be honest, I don't know what's going on behind the scenes, either way, it concerns

22:19.880 --> 22:20.880
me.

22:20.880 --> 22:23.960
The idea that someone like Michaud, if he's as unpredictable as the document presents

22:23.960 --> 22:28.340
him, having that control over a domain, and partial hold on a character that's a primary

22:28.340 --> 22:30.640
source of income, makes my skin crawl.

22:30.640 --> 22:35.380
Even if they may seem like the best person, be so fucking careful of who you entrust with

22:35.380 --> 22:36.380
your future.

22:36.380 --> 22:39.160
This situation seems beyond precarious.

22:39.200 --> 22:43.080
The moral of the story is, businesses behave like businesses sometimes, and questionable

22:43.080 --> 22:47.160
practice is common, however, people expected better from channelawesome.

22:47.160 --> 22:50.920
People wanted better from channelawesome, because of how it presented itself.

22:50.920 --> 22:54.920
If you want to set up a business or a site, don't just give it to the first person who

22:54.920 --> 22:58.320
asks, and certainly don't give anything away that could be held against you as ransom in

22:58.320 --> 22:59.320
the future.

22:59.320 --> 23:02.960
If you are a creator, be very careful of who you work with, and what they can actually

23:02.960 --> 23:03.960
do for you.

23:03.960 --> 23:06.880
Do not commit yourself, and don't let them off just because you like them.

23:06.880 --> 23:11.200
A wrongdoing is a wrongdoing, and do not let third parties exploit your respect for the

23:11.200 --> 23:15.320
figureheads of the company, and do not let them denigrate you, you're worth more than

23:15.320 --> 23:16.320
that.

23:16.320 --> 23:20.040
And if you do decide to work with your idols, you're often setting yourself up for disappointments,

23:20.040 --> 23:23.040
so try not to let excitement dictate your expectations.

23:23.040 --> 23:26.680
Regardless of what is said, I hope that we will move closer to discovering the truth,

23:26.680 --> 23:31.440
because if it is as it seems, although injustice will always exist in certain places, environments

23:31.440 --> 23:34.920
like channelawesome can do better, and they should do better.

23:34.920 --> 23:36.680
I hope that they will do better.

23:36.680 --> 23:40.800
The reason it has emotionally resonated a lot more, why there's passionate disagreement

23:40.800 --> 23:44.240
is because it's a more intimate community, this feels more personal.

23:44.240 --> 23:48.400
It's only because people care, channelawesome has done things for people, people want it

23:48.400 --> 23:50.880
to be good, and that's a powerful sentiment.

23:50.880 --> 23:55.800
Doug, you've inspired many people, don't let external factors be a foil to that perception.

23:55.800 --> 23:59.440
Only you know the truth of how you feel, and I hope you can convey that properly in the

23:59.440 --> 24:00.440
future.

24:00.440 --> 24:04.600
Your career is far from over, but I do hope you put out a response, I think it would be

24:04.600 --> 24:05.600
justified.

24:05.600 --> 24:07.960
And importantly, how do you, the viewer, feel?

24:07.960 --> 24:10.400
What are your instincts saying about these allegations?

24:10.400 --> 24:12.240
I'd love to hear your thoughts below.

24:12.240 --> 24:16.840
Also, I have a new Twitter, at TheRightOpinion, rather than at RightOpinionYT.

24:16.840 --> 24:19.880
I don't know if my outro will be sorted at this point about it yet, but hopefully it

24:19.880 --> 24:20.880
will be soon.

24:20.880 --> 24:24.880
Also, big shout out to the editors who've done a fantastic job, it's another beautiful

24:24.880 --> 24:26.800
edit and I'm sure it's going to look great.

24:26.800 --> 24:30.560
And make sure you go and check out the editors if you do, because a lot of them make content

24:30.560 --> 24:31.560
themselves.

24:31.560 --> 24:34.720
But thank you for joining me with this truly fascinating discussion, one that provokes

24:34.720 --> 24:36.640
a number of interesting questions.

24:36.640 --> 24:40.920
However, until those questions are answered, I'm TheRightOpinion, and I'll see you in

24:40.920 --> 24:41.440
the next one.
