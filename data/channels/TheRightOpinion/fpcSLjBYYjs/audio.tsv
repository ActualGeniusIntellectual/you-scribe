0	8880	Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too
8880	9880	much free time.
9880	13300	And when people ask me what inspired me to start YouTube, if I was to list off channels
13300	17280	that served as motivation for my YouTube career, Channel Awesome and most notably Doug Walker,
17280	19700	aka The Nostalgia Critic, was one of them.
19700	23000	Every Tuesday night, I grab a takeaway and pull up my laptop and watch his latest review
23000	27000	in almost a ritualistic manner, and that habit has continued up until this day.
27000	30160	Even though I'm not unconditionally in love with his content, it's hard to deny they've
30160	33560	brought me gems like Sharkboy and Lavagirl that I'll be chuckling for days following,
33560	37480	and I don't laugh at much these days, so for someone as emotionally soulless as me to have
37480	41720	that sort of content to at least entertain the vacuum was meaningful, and I've learned
41720	45400	a lot about cinema through the indirect messages often portrayed in their episodes.
45400	46840	It's often clever commentary.
46840	49560	I found out about The Nostalgia Critic through that guy with the glasses.
49560	54080	I cannot exactly say how that happened, we're talking about approximately 2011 when I discovered
54080	57600	their content, so bringing specifics into my memory is a challenge to say the least.
57600	61400	Though I will say that I also discovered two other critics, Todd In The Shadows and The
61400	64560	Rat Critic in quick succession, although I'm not sure in which order.
64560	68280	But much alike to the NC, they are two critics whom I still watch to this day.
68280	71600	I'm not going to enter too much depth, but I assume it's a story that you already know
71600	75280	by now, but that guy with the glasses was set up by a partnership between Doug Walker
75280	77680	and a few other people that we'll get to in a moment.
77680	81960	This was done in light of the very stringent copyright rules regarding YouTube and a situation
81960	85560	with regards to his Five Second Movies, and it's covered in a nice little article that
85560	86560	I will link below.
86560	90120	I know the fair use debate or not is quite contentious, and it's fairly subjective.
90120	93840	It's the sort of comedic cutting that came into contention earlier this year with Sargon
93840	97720	of Akkad and Akkila, obviously, but either way, hosting videos on Blip and using their
97720	102000	domain as a way to embed their content, they decided it would be reasonable to host a numerous
102000	103440	selection of creators as well.
103440	105600	But wait a minute, I hear you say, who are they?
105600	107400	Well, let's talk about the main characters.
107400	111140	We've got Doug Walker, who we've already introduced, his brother Rob Walker, and a
111140	113060	third individual named Mike Michaud.
113060	116660	The two other individuals were Mike Elish and Bhargav Drom and Raju, the latter of which
116660	119620	there isn't too much to say and the former of whom we'll address later.
119620	123620	Now, if you're thinking to yourself, huh, I've never heard of Michaud, don't worry,
123620	126860	I hadn't heard of him either until a couple weeks before the memo, when I coincidentally
126860	131180	found myself on their Wikipedia page, briefly before the document in question was released.
131180	135140	I remember thinking to myself, I've never heard of this bloke, what does he do?
135140	140060	Well, things, he does things, things that we'll address very soon.
140100	144020	I was having a discussion with Quinton Reviews over this before the documents were released.
144020	147940	We had both noted how many creators had left abruptly and seemingly with little notice.
147940	150100	We'd wondered about the explanations for such decisions.
150100	155500	Well, on April the 2nd, after rumbles of activity, we received their full side of the story.
155500	159520	The document itself is an approximately 70-page condemnation of Channel Awesome and their
159520	162340	questionable behaviour and incidents that resulted due to it.
162340	166260	Now, I'm someone who always looks into such claims with an element of scepticism.
166260	170020	It's an integral part of my philosophy because if I didn't, then I think that such an approach
170020	173940	could easily be exploited by people with malintent, although I do completely comprehend
173940	175340	that it's a tender subject.
175340	179900	Even with that said, the sheer number of corroborating testimonies and accounts makes it hard to
179900	180900	dispute to say the least.
180900	183560	Saying any of it is purposely falsified at all is a push.
183560	186700	They persuaded me over the benefit of the doubt line for Channel Awesome.
186700	190780	I've read all 70 pages and it definitely seems like there's a strong element of truth to it.
190780	193460	The document had a few purposes from an outsider's perspective.
193460	197220	The first was to challenge the images of certain public representatives, most notably Doug
197220	198220	and Rob Walker.
198220	201780	Walker is presented as a naive visionary who was blinded by his own apparitions and was
201780	206280	often complicit in too many things, while Rob is portrayed as a socially unaware, disinterested
206280	207940	and occasionally callous figure.
207940	211780	Now obviously these moments are spotlighting the worst incidents that have occurred, however
211780	213900	this does not denigrate their existence.
213900	217260	Nonetheless it's clear that there are still people who have had positive experiences with
217260	220740	the Walkers and I'll try and investigate this divide in a bit, however we have a bit
220740	224580	more explanation to cut through before we start to dissect this very sorry situation.
224940	229060	Yes, the real story comes when discussing the company's CEO Mike Michaud, now if there's
229060	233220	someone who came out with less than a flattering image, it would be the elusive majority stakeholder
233220	234340	in the business.
234340	237980	The document has multiple individuals who testify that his behaviour was less than adequate
237980	241260	and once again I'm not going to go into specifics as that's already done in the document,
241260	245360	but allegations include bullying, coercion, throwing fits, ignoring a scandal, failing
245360	249180	to act on concern, favouritism and shafting creators he did not like.
249180	251180	And that's really just the tip of the iceberg.
251180	254520	He doesn't come across as a pleasant fellow to say the least, and although evidence is
254520	258480	not provided to substantiate every claim, there is definitely enough, including an actual
258480	262600	audio clip, albeit a short one, which shows him actively exiling a creator from returning
262600	265640	to the site, while also having signalled no intent to inform him.
265640	269840	There are a fair few DMs of him behaving rather coldly, and some just of him not responding
269840	273600	at all to necessary messages, although none of his supposed eruptions are recorded, I
273600	277920	do not doubt the legitimacy of the claims, either way his name is not shrouded in glory
277920	281180	throughout what is written, and on top of that it appears that he has channel awesome
281180	285500	in a stranglehold where he has partial license over the Nostalgia Critic, Doug Walker's
285500	286500	lifeline.
286500	289940	Now if this information is true, which I have no reason to believe it otherwise, it places
289940	293980	Doug in a very awkward ultimatum, where the main source of his income is partly in the
293980	298660	hands of someone who can practically do anything he wants, and given the illustration of this
298660	302420	character, he isn't the sort of person you'd want to entrust such a responsibility with.
302420	306060	This theory intertwines fairly well with the memo, with situations where it appears that
306060	309900	Doug was trying to act as a person to mediate, but still side with the business, with the
309900	314140	business becoming synonymous with the CEO in question, but keeping all this information
314140	318540	in mind, we have to ask ourselves what can be learned from this situation, what can we
318540	332380	learn from Channel Awesome?
332380	336380	Now in a way, what is written in the memo is fairly unexceptional to me, I've worked
336380	340420	five jobs in my life, two of them tried to swindle money out of me when I left, and another
340420	343940	had an adverse and unpredictable boss who was not good to work around.
343940	347700	A lot of the stories told in the Not-Saucer memo focus on that sort of environment, one
347700	351220	that many of you watching this video have probably experienced within employment.
351220	355140	So although there is more, why is it necessary that they document topics that appear to be
355140	357900	part of what you deal with when getting into a job?
357900	360900	Well it's mainly to challenge the public perception above all.
360900	364380	Channel Awesome or That Guy With The Glasses was always presented as this community, this
364380	369300	group of people who were getting along and having fun, all mates, Doug the benign overlord
369300	373140	and the management who had you in their interest, many people wanted to join.
373140	376860	I mean even when I present it like that, you'd think it's far fetched, but that's the default
376860	380740	thing we have when we think of the platforms challenging the YouTube mentality, but at
380740	384020	the end of the day, it seems that Channel Awesome was just another shell.
384020	388300	That's not particularly special, but we have this subconscious expectation of what CA should
388300	390340	be, and here is the alternate take.
390340	394260	This doesn't shock me at all, it's not something that is alien to me in fact, it's just a
394260	398540	shame that if it's true, a few bad apples, maybe even just the one, spoiled the whole
398540	402220	bunch, and ruined what could have been a genuinely surreal experience.
402220	406940	As a CEO, you often have to make tough decisions, with an element of ruthlessness to them.
406940	411620	CEOs have the highest representative proportion of psychopaths and sociopaths in those occupations,
411620	412940	in part for that reason.
412940	417380	Now I'm not saying that Michaud in this instance is a psychopath, but the revelation of a CEO
417380	421940	being particularly merciless is not a surprise to me either, and once again I emphasise that
421940	426660	not all the claims are completely substantiated, so I don't take them as a certainty, however
426660	431340	circumstantially what is written is very plausible given business and staff practice in general,
431340	434820	the fact that there are people who we might think we know through their content is irrelevant.
434820	438860	However, whereas many businesses there is a stake in the employees, there was very little
438860	442700	worth in that guy with the glasses, you see, they didn't take a stake in the income made
442700	446780	by the individual producers, and although this on principle may sound good to them,
446780	450900	it means that they were just promotional instruments, and therefore if their promotional value was
450900	454180	diminished, the management had free reign to strike them off as they pleased.
454180	457860	I think these loose working relationships were always destined to fail, especially if
457860	460300	one fell out of favour with someone like Michaud.
460300	463100	There was no binding contract, there was no legality.
463100	466420	Unless you were actually employed, there was not really much you could do in the way of
466420	470740	injustices, you're always walking a tightrope, and I think that's where the apparent contradiction
470740	474700	came in, there were clearly people who wanted to make Channel Awesome into this community,
474700	478100	the films, the collabs, but when it came down to it, there were others who weren't part
478100	480380	of that who could also pull the plug as they wished.
480380	484300	And again, having a rift in the vision of management would rarely be conducive to create
484300	486980	a wellbeing, especially when no resolve is clear.
486980	491180	I don't like a lot of businesses, that's why being self-employed isn't ideal for me.
491180	495040	The moment you relinquish control of what you truly want to do is the moment it becomes
495040	497700	a lot harder to realise your creative visions.
497700	501220	And that's the thing, Channel Awesome didn't necessarily feel like a business, it's not
501220	504940	an employer to many of these people, and in that way that should have put them at ease,
504940	508900	but in fact it led to their positions becoming more insecure, and when someone like Michaud
508900	511640	is around, you will always feel slightly fragile.
511640	515620	Many of the things written about in the document are common occurrences in standard businesses,
515620	519980	on YouTube even, I've seen my friends have their channels unjustifiably terminated, and
519980	523700	although they were restored, it was not a pleasant experience for them.
523700	527460	Channel Awesome was meant to be better than that, they presented themselves as better
527460	528460	than that.
528460	531580	I think that's the ultimate disappointment, that at the end of the day, it seems they
531580	535700	were no different, and in almost a way to affirm this, they put out an awful tweet where
535700	538540	they say that they regret that the producers feel this way.
538580	541920	Now if you've watched my YouTube response to fellow humans, you'll know that I have
541920	546060	no time for vague responses, and it doesn't become much vaguer than what was on show here.
546060	551340	It is simple advice, if you feel that a response is insufficient, then maybe best to hold it
551340	555540	off, because it's just self incriminating if you use phrases like, we regret that you
555540	556540	feel that way.
556540	558060	What's that even meant to imply?
558060	562620	It's a pathetic response, and listen, I understand that when such a blitz of criticisms ambushes
562620	565780	you, it's hard to know exactly how to respond, it's never easy.
565780	571020	But there are ways not to respond, and congratulations CA, you have perfectly executed how not to
571020	572020	respond.
572020	576220	And then came their second response, and this one was meant to answer the allegations directly,
576220	578640	once again it was insufficient and subjective.
578640	582500	My favourite part was how they responded to former staff member Holly Brown by just saying
582500	586540	that her allegations are not true, but not explaining why they weren't true, or presenting
586540	589780	an alternative version of events, which would be necessary.
589780	594940	The accusation being listed as Holly Brown makes numerous accusations is not even remotely
594940	597040	logical, do you even PR?
597040	601620	It also stated that they could quote obviously not respond to the 73 pages of allegation,
601620	604520	yes you could, if it would help your case, you should.
604520	607700	They claim they are going to answer the most egregious ones but don't even mention the
607700	612540	allegation that Michaud bullied a producer into a suicidal mindset, that one seemed pretty
612540	613780	inflammatory if you ask me.
613780	617400	I know there may be some other responses by the time this video is out, however my prediction
617400	621240	is that they will not satisfy people, as the only way to truly respond would be to present
621240	625040	alternate perspectives in each experience, and no one seems willing to do that.
625040	629080	And although I don't like writing at extra points last minute, I was just rerunning over
629080	631720	their second response and it's even worse than I thought.
631720	635440	For example, their first point is how they claim the screenshots they provided show they
635440	638940	dealt with the issue within three weeks, when all it shows is that there were three weeks
638940	643320	in between two conversations around the issue, and anyone could have been aware of it before
643320	644320	then.
644320	647200	How they think this is definitive counter evidence is beyond me and people will see
647200	649960	through it, and people have seen through it.
649960	653520	It couldn't be more corporate if it tried, and that's the issue, and that's why this
653520	656000	document is often focused on image.
656000	660200	Doug Walker is not Channel Awesome, he is Channel Awesome's PR, he is Channel Awesome's
660200	664720	presenter, and what really goes on behind the scenes is not done in the community spirit.
664720	668840	To that, you might argue, they have no obligation to, and you are completely right, they are
668840	673560	not obliged to behave in their producers best interests, but in a way, that's accepted
673560	675080	as premise in this.
675080	679840	What the document was more about was people falsely believing that it is a creator-focused
679840	680840	platform.
680840	684120	Now of course, there were some more exceptional situations, such as the sexual harassment
684120	688200	issues with former executive Mike Ellis, but the document doesn't necessarily focus on
688200	692960	him more on Michaud's reaction to Ellis' behaviour, which appears to be passive to say the least.
692960	697480	As Ellis is not an incumbent member of management, to focus a document on a departed member would
697480	701480	clearly undermine the intended relevance, even if it's based off old events, there are
701480	703880	still people currently in the loop.
703880	707480	Channel Awesome is a business, many of the allegations do not surprise me, we will talk
707480	709080	about the more serious ones soon.
709080	713520	However, the reason why this document surprised a lot of people, despite the mostly unremarkable
713520	718640	claims is because it contradicts the image, and images everything to a lot of these people.
718640	723280	So for such damning claims to come against the quote, good guys, is more shocking than
723280	727880	if someone complained about YouTube employees being mean to them, because Channel Awesome
727880	733280	were meant to be better, and they wanted to be better, and they presented themselves as
733280	739560	better.
739560	744160	In her testimony, former administrator Holly Brown wrote that the Walkers didn't know Michaud
744160	746480	and his associates until they approached him.
746480	750560	Now the way Brown presents it makes it look like Michaud just turned up on Walker's doorstep,
750560	755520	now I cannot say it was to that degree, however it did seem to be a fairly spontaneous business
755520	760400	venture, and if true, this is bad business practice, and we're gonna use my Discord as
760400	761400	an example.
761400	765240	I ran a few servers in my time, and if there's two things I've learned, it's firstly, never
765240	769520	give someone an administrator role just because they're your friends, and secondly, never
769520	772940	give someone an administrator role just because they asked for it.
772940	773940	Why is that?
773940	777680	Well the latter in this example is particularly important, because if someone is interested
777680	781960	in working for me and they just straight up ask, it is not grounds to sign away, no matter
781960	786360	how intent they may seem at the time, even if they have a plethora of reasons for why
786360	787360	you should.
787360	791380	The issue is that someone consciously trying to attain a role often means they don't present
791380	795620	themselves as who they are, especially if such effort is exerted over a short amount
795620	796620	of time.
796620	800240	The way Brown presents it implies that Michaud and his mates pretty much turned up and got
800240	801240	the job.
801240	803900	I can't say whether it's true or not, but that is how it is presented.
803900	807100	Now when he turned up he may have looked the part, and I understand that, in the moment
807100	810940	he might have seemed like the perfect candidate for the position, but human beings just do
810940	812100	not work like that.
812100	815540	You really have to see firstly how they perform when they think someone isn't looking, and
815540	819580	also how they perform over a longer stretch of time, how much they're willing to put in
819580	820700	for that next step.
820700	824560	You have to measure that genuine commitment rather than what may be masqueraded.
824560	828460	When I made my Discord server I approached a majority of admins from previous servers
828460	832120	and offered them the role, because I knew them from their own performances and I knew
832120	833900	that they weren't expecting that.
833900	837460	Now that's not possible for every occupation, and obviously someone would always have to
837460	842020	anticipate taking the role of CEO, but you can't just sign it away to the first person
842020	846180	who comes to you, that's playing with fire, and in this instance it seems multiple people
846180	847180	got burned.
847180	850400	And although I will not be integrating an excessive number of personal observations,
850400	854340	I must say that the original That Guy With The Glasses website layout became outdated
854340	858340	very quickly, and the team appear to lack any distinguishing expertise that might give
858340	862060	them an appeal that may compensate for them behaving less than respectfully.
862060	865980	What I'm saying is that even if they were a dodgy lot they may have a unique skillset,
865980	870080	some redeeming quality that gave them grounds for hire, however that was just not on display
870080	873860	when you went on the site, and judging by the numerous technical criticisms, it was
873860	876660	not on display in other areas as well.
876660	880660	Unfortunately there are a fair few sly dogs who can impress in a short term period but
880660	884340	quickly turn into the sort of character that Miss Short is portrayed as, however whereas
884340	888740	in my Discord I can quickly strike off who I decide unfit to handle such power, by having
888740	893080	them as the majority shareholder and shared owner of the Nostalgia Critic IP, it frankly
893080	899300	gave him an unhealthy amount of control, it's an inconceivable level of mishandling of responsibility,
899300	902760	even if Miss Short is not the person he has made out to be in the document.
902760	906380	The other concern is when you begin to involve numerous family or friends, which was quite
906420	910580	uncommon in Channel Awesome, nepotism can become rife, as although it may not genuinely
910580	914420	reflect who they are as people in general, having an affirmed bias towards people you
914420	917100	might have an emotional connection with is very common.
917100	921740	This does not necessarily guarantee bad management, but many often can make the false assumption
921740	926060	that because there's a level of intimacy, that person may feel more obliged to you.
926060	929740	This is true sometimes, but it's dependent on the presence of yourself.
929740	933580	As demonstrated in the memo, it's conveyed the people assigned to the roles didn't want
933580	936140	the job and were often absent from this post.
936140	937860	This is not good, and here's why.
937860	941380	In the absence of supervision, someone who is their friend or family member can firstly
941380	945740	levy the trust of their word, and supervisors who do not want the job do not want the conflicts
945740	949700	associated with it either, and will likely side with their friend or family member within
949700	954220	disagreements, as disputes in the workplace would extend a lot further on a personal basis.
954220	958140	Combined with this, the fact that the people in this situation already have considerable
958140	961520	control in the workplace, it is a recipe for disaster.
961520	965100	This is only inflamed by the fact that the producers were not bound by contract, so in
965100	967380	disputes you could just pull them from the sites.
967380	970500	In a way, I'm almost amazed more abuse didn't occur at the time.
970500	973820	The culture created through the pretense of that guy with the glasses and the mentality
973820	978340	adopted by the Walker brothers cultivated an ideal scenario for easy exploitation.
978340	979980	It's almost stupendous.
979980	983300	Regardless of what you think of the validity of the document at hand, there is something
983300	987540	fundamentally worrying about the thought of handing over the IP and shares of an asset
987540	989200	vital to your survival.
989200	990620	That seems crazy to me.
990620	994640	On the surface, it seems like disorganised, distant management, unfamiliar with the awful
994680	997400	decisions they were making, with some truly rotten eggs.
997400	1002120	However, with that all said, everything irrational, everything immoral, has something that underlines
1002120	1005640	it, a decision that may make sense at the time, and although we could say that Michaud
1005640	1009240	is an unpleasant person with some degree of conviction, there's probably a lot more going
1009240	1012160	on behind the scenes with regards to other characters in this story.
1012160	1015920	If there's one thing I've learned is that even good people in bad environments can make
1015920	1017320	dreadful decisions.
1017320	1021140	Nonetheless, throughout the document, many of its authors retrospectively illustrate
1021140	1025340	themselves as starry-eyed, naive individuals, willing to take some jabs for their idols,
1025340	1028980	and all it takes in those situations is one slightly negative actor to take advantage
1028980	1029980	of that.
1029980	1038940	What message can be imparted from that onto the audience of this document?
1038940	1042860	Now before anyone reacts and criticises me for such a general statement, I am aware it
1042860	1043860	is a hyperbole.
1043860	1048180	I am not saying that you should lock yourself up and never be afraid to interact with people
1048180	1049180	you look up to.
1049180	1050180	Not at all.
1050220	1052220	There are certain environments in which this is perfectly reasonable.
1052220	1055540	However, situations with Channel Awesome are a whole different ballpark.
1055540	1056540	Why is that?
1056540	1058860	Well, you're not just meeting someone, but you're working with someone.
1058860	1062580	Under the premise of what can be construed as a business venture, firstly, you're almost
1062580	1064780	certain to go beyond their public facade.
1064780	1067100	That's not an inherently bad thing on principle.
1067100	1069140	Sometimes it's good to see how someone really operates.
1069140	1073540	However, businesses are by nature rooted in conflict, and situations like that of Channel
1073540	1074940	Awesome are not uncommon.
1074940	1079060	Nonetheless, what makes it unique is how many admire those like Doug Walker.
1079060	1080380	Let me give you an example.
1080380	1084460	Do Walmart employees join with an idolisation of Greg Penner or Doug McMillan?
1084460	1085460	Let's just say it's unlikely.
1085460	1089420	They'd probably join with a fonder view of internet sensation such as the yodelling kid.
1089420	1092780	But the yodelling kid isn't in cahoots with human resources.
1092780	1093780	That's the thing.
1093780	1096820	You're partially in the vicinity of a public figure, and in fact, comparably, it could
1096820	1100540	be considered quite intimate to the point where, even if you had a very minimal role,
1100540	1104460	you still felt like you were in some form of contact with figureheads like Doug Walker.
1104460	1106320	But I'd argue that's not a good thing.
1106320	1109620	Producers naturally require hard decisions, and having your career damaged by someone
1109620	1111720	who you admire can really be soul destroying.
1111720	1115360	A lot of these producers came in with the expectation of what Channel Awesome would
1115360	1116360	be.
1116360	1119480	This unique community, as I said earlier, Channel Awesome was meant to be different.
1119480	1123400	I know plenty of people who wanted to go and work there for the image that it had created.
1123400	1127160	However, because of this public image, when many of the producers were subjected to what
1127160	1130960	could be seen as maltreatment, they may have questioned it, may have placed blame on themselves,
1130960	1135360	and maybe asked whether their perspective was just an outcome of their actions.
1135400	1139640	Producers also felt fragile in their own positions, because Channel Awesome had complete prerogative
1139640	1143580	to remove creators from the site whenever they wished, and producers could not try and
1143580	1146520	challenge it, because there were no binding contracts.
1146520	1151260	Channel Awesome isn't necessarily an employer, but in effect, that made the situation worse.
1151260	1155120	It appears that Michaud came along with his own agenda and exploited producers and their
1155120	1157600	admiration of Doug Walker to the maximum degree.
1157600	1161600	And with the Nostalgia Critic IP partially under his belt, and the producers under his
1161600	1166200	some, it led to the alleged subsequent bullying of creators, atop a lengthy silence even after
1166200	1167520	many producers departed.
1167520	1171560	However, to take down Michaud, many of these producers would also have to lightly confront
1171560	1175460	their conflicting feelings about Walker and Channel Awesome, the fact that his content
1175460	1179920	still brings joy to many people's lives, the respect for the content that he puts out,
1179920	1184440	the question of how common these situations were, whether their situations were individual
1184440	1187760	experiences, whether it's worth the risk considering the overlap in their fanbase.
1187760	1191280	A lot of this yields from the fact that people wanted to look at an environment like Channel
1191280	1195520	Awesome in a positive light, and only after years of deliberation and consultation could
1195520	1200320	they create a remotely convincing image otherwise, one that people have undoubtedly disputed
1200320	1201320	regardless.
1201320	1202560	And that is fine.
1202560	1203560	That is healthy.
1203560	1207100	I'm not guaranteeing that everything in this document is 100% accurate.
1207100	1210800	If you want to question the validity in search of the truth, then more power to you.
1210800	1214240	But either way, there is a lot at stake for creators in this, leaving and subsequently
1214240	1218600	condemning a platform that, in spite of the allegations, has contributed a lot to their
1218600	1219600	career.
1220280	1224120	But that can't alone undermine the written expectations of these people.
1224120	1227760	When people say never meet your heroes, that statement alone is reductionist.
1227760	1230520	However, there's a reason why such an idiom exists.
1230520	1234200	When we watch these people from afar, they may seem great, they may seem like the ideal
1234200	1236360	people to have working relationships with.
1236360	1239980	It's just not the case, and you have to approach it with the same caution that you'd approach
1239980	1241940	any prospective opportunity with.
1241940	1245120	When that opportunity presents itself, you should really question whether you want to
1245120	1247280	put your own career in their hands.
1247280	1251200	I've had the pleasure of working with people I've admired for a long time, but I've also
1251200	1253640	been greatly disappointed by certain people.
1253640	1257760	This disappointment is something that can magnify and manifest into many different emotions
1257760	1260740	when you have the conditions the channel awesome presents.
1260740	1264840	It doesn't mean they're bad people, but even if they're good people, they may make mistakes,
1264840	1268760	they may involve bad people, and you might be at the receiving end of that.
1268760	1270440	That could really taint your dreams.
1270440	1273880	If you do find yourself in these situations, you have to put your innate bias towards these
1273880	1280040	people aside, you have to look at the situation independently and separate your own expectations.
1280040	1283120	Situational context matters, I cannot stress that enough.
1283120	1287520	How good or bad characters like Doug or Rob Walker are is down for you to decide, but
1287520	1291400	either way, if the situation is as it appears, they have made some awful mistakes, whether
1291400	1294920	it's not understanding the environments for making a film, handing over their vision to
1294920	1299140	someone with less than amiable intentions, or the numerous decisions that followed.
1299140	1302920	Whether they are comfortable in that position, whether they were comfortable in that position,
1302920	1306680	is regardless, they stayed in it, and that is the real shame.
1306680	1310520	These decisions appear to come from a lack of guidance, a false sense of security, and
1310520	1315100	supposed exploitation of the worst denominator, and a mechanism to perhaps try and justify
1315100	1317480	these people's decisions in their heads.
1317480	1320860	Michaud appears to be the villain of this tale, nonetheless, I would be intrigued to
1320860	1324080	hear if the Walkers have anything to say about these allegations.
1324080	1327780	Although they may not wish to respond, I feel that there are people still open to hearing
1327780	1331120	them out, as they are not portrayed as irredeemable in the documents.
1331120	1335520	To respond under the channelawesome banner with a pseudo-apology would be a grave mistake,
1335520	1339880	but to be honest, I don't know what's going on behind the scenes, either way, it concerns
1339880	1340880	me.
1340880	1343960	The idea that someone like Michaud, if he's as unpredictable as the document presents
1343960	1348340	him, having that control over a domain, and partial hold on a character that's a primary
1348340	1350640	source of income, makes my skin crawl.
1350640	1355380	Even if they may seem like the best person, be so fucking careful of who you entrust with
1355380	1356380	your future.
1356380	1359160	This situation seems beyond precarious.
1359200	1363080	The moral of the story is, businesses behave like businesses sometimes, and questionable
1363080	1367160	practice is common, however, people expected better from channelawesome.
1367160	1370920	People wanted better from channelawesome, because of how it presented itself.
1370920	1374920	If you want to set up a business or a site, don't just give it to the first person who
1374920	1378320	asks, and certainly don't give anything away that could be held against you as ransom in
1378320	1379320	the future.
1379320	1382960	If you are a creator, be very careful of who you work with, and what they can actually
1382960	1383960	do for you.
1383960	1386880	Do not commit yourself, and don't let them off just because you like them.
1386880	1391200	A wrongdoing is a wrongdoing, and do not let third parties exploit your respect for the
1391200	1395320	figureheads of the company, and do not let them denigrate you, you're worth more than
1395320	1396320	that.
1396320	1400040	And if you do decide to work with your idols, you're often setting yourself up for disappointments,
1400040	1403040	so try not to let excitement dictate your expectations.
1403040	1406680	Regardless of what is said, I hope that we will move closer to discovering the truth,
1406680	1411440	because if it is as it seems, although injustice will always exist in certain places, environments
1411440	1414920	like channelawesome can do better, and they should do better.
1414920	1416680	I hope that they will do better.
1416680	1420800	The reason it has emotionally resonated a lot more, why there's passionate disagreement
1420800	1424240	is because it's a more intimate community, this feels more personal.
1424240	1428400	It's only because people care, channelawesome has done things for people, people want it
1428400	1430880	to be good, and that's a powerful sentiment.
1430880	1435800	Doug, you've inspired many people, don't let external factors be a foil to that perception.
1435800	1439440	Only you know the truth of how you feel, and I hope you can convey that properly in the
1439440	1440440	future.
1440440	1444600	Your career is far from over, but I do hope you put out a response, I think it would be
1444600	1445600	justified.
1445600	1447960	And importantly, how do you, the viewer, feel?
1447960	1450400	What are your instincts saying about these allegations?
1450400	1452240	I'd love to hear your thoughts below.
1452240	1456840	Also, I have a new Twitter, at TheRightOpinion, rather than at RightOpinionYT.
1456840	1459880	I don't know if my outro will be sorted at this point about it yet, but hopefully it
1459880	1460880	will be soon.
1460880	1464880	Also, big shout out to the editors who've done a fantastic job, it's another beautiful
1464880	1466800	edit and I'm sure it's going to look great.
1466800	1470560	And make sure you go and check out the editors if you do, because a lot of them make content
1470560	1471560	themselves.
1471560	1474720	But thank you for joining me with this truly fascinating discussion, one that provokes
1474720	1476640	a number of interesting questions.
1476640	1480920	However, until those questions are answered, I'm TheRightOpinion, and I'll see you in
1480920	1481440	the next one.
