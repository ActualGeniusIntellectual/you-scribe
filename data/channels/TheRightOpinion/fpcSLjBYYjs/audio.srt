00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,880
much free time.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,300
And when people ask me what inspired me to start YouTube, if I was to list off channels

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,280
that served as motivation for my YouTube career, Channel Awesome and most notably Doug Walker,

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,700
aka The Nostalgia Critic, was one of them.

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,000
Every Tuesday night, I grab a takeaway and pull up my laptop and watch his latest review

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
in almost a ritualistic manner, and that habit has continued up until this day.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,160
Even though I'm not unconditionally in love with his content, it's hard to deny they've

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,560
brought me gems like Sharkboy and Lavagirl that I'll be chuckling for days following,

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,480
and I don't laugh at much these days, so for someone as emotionally soulless as me to have

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,720
that sort of content to at least entertain the vacuum was meaningful, and I've learned

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,400
a lot about cinema through the indirect messages often portrayed in their episodes.

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,840
It's often clever commentary.

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,560
I found out about The Nostalgia Critic through that guy with the glasses.

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,080
I cannot exactly say how that happened, we're talking about approximately 2011 when I discovered

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,600
their content, so bringing specifics into my memory is a challenge to say the least.

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,400
Though I will say that I also discovered two other critics, Todd In The Shadows and The

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,560
Rat Critic in quick succession, although I'm not sure in which order.

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,280
But much alike to the NC, they are two critics whom I still watch to this day.

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,600
I'm not going to enter too much depth, but I assume it's a story that you already know

21
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,280
by now, but that guy with the glasses was set up by a partnership between Doug Walker

22
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,680
and a few other people that we'll get to in a moment.

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,960
This was done in light of the very stringent copyright rules regarding YouTube and a situation

24
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,560
with regards to his Five Second Movies, and it's covered in a nice little article that

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,560
I will link below.

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,120
I know the fair use debate or not is quite contentious, and it's fairly subjective.

27
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,840
It's the sort of comedic cutting that came into contention earlier this year with Sargon

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,720
of Akkad and Akkila, obviously, but either way, hosting videos on Blip and using their

29
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,000
domain as a way to embed their content, they decided it would be reasonable to host a numerous

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,440
selection of creators as well.

31
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,600
But wait a minute, I hear you say, who are they?

32
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,400
Well, let's talk about the main characters.

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,140
We've got Doug Walker, who we've already introduced, his brother Rob Walker, and a

34
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,060
third individual named Mike Michaud.

35
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,660
The two other individuals were Mike Elish and Bhargav Drom and Raju, the latter of which

36
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,620
there isn't too much to say and the former of whom we'll address later.

37
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,620
Now, if you're thinking to yourself, huh, I've never heard of Michaud, don't worry,

38
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,860
I hadn't heard of him either until a couple weeks before the memo, when I coincidentally

39
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,180
found myself on their Wikipedia page, briefly before the document in question was released.

40
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,140
I remember thinking to myself, I've never heard of this bloke, what does he do?

41
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,060
Well, things, he does things, things that we'll address very soon.

42
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,020
I was having a discussion with Quinton Reviews over this before the documents were released.

43
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,940
We had both noted how many creators had left abruptly and seemingly with little notice.

44
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,100
We'd wondered about the explanations for such decisions.

45
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:35,500
Well, on April the 2nd, after rumbles of activity, we received their full side of the story.

46
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,520
The document itself is an approximately 70-page condemnation of Channel Awesome and their

47
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,340
questionable behaviour and incidents that resulted due to it.

48
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,260
Now, I'm someone who always looks into such claims with an element of scepticism.

49
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,020
It's an integral part of my philosophy because if I didn't, then I think that such an approach

50
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,940
could easily be exploited by people with malintent, although I do completely comprehend

51
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,340
that it's a tender subject.

52
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,900
Even with that said, the sheer number of corroborating testimonies and accounts makes it hard to

53
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,900
dispute to say the least.

54
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,560
Saying any of it is purposely falsified at all is a push.

55
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,700
They persuaded me over the benefit of the doubt line for Channel Awesome.

56
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,780
I've read all 70 pages and it definitely seems like there's a strong element of truth to it.

57
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,460
The document had a few purposes from an outsider's perspective.

58
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,220
The first was to challenge the images of certain public representatives, most notably Doug

59
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,220
and Rob Walker.

60
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,780
Walker is presented as a naive visionary who was blinded by his own apparitions and was

61
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,280
often complicit in too many things, while Rob is portrayed as a socially unaware, disinterested

62
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,940
and occasionally callous figure.

63
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,780
Now obviously these moments are spotlighting the worst incidents that have occurred, however

64
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,900
this does not denigrate their existence.

65
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,260
Nonetheless it's clear that there are still people who have had positive experiences with

66
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,740
the Walkers and I'll try and investigate this divide in a bit, however we have a bit

67
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,580
more explanation to cut through before we start to dissect this very sorry situation.

68
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,060
Yes, the real story comes when discussing the company's CEO Mike Michaud, now if there's

69
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,220
someone who came out with less than a flattering image, it would be the elusive majority stakeholder

70
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,340
in the business.

71
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,980
The document has multiple individuals who testify that his behaviour was less than adequate

72
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,260
and once again I'm not going to go into specifics as that's already done in the document,

73
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,360
but allegations include bullying, coercion, throwing fits, ignoring a scandal, failing

74
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,180
to act on concern, favouritism and shafting creators he did not like.

75
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,180
And that's really just the tip of the iceberg.

76
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,520
He doesn't come across as a pleasant fellow to say the least, and although evidence is

77
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,480
not provided to substantiate every claim, there is definitely enough, including an actual

78
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,600
audio clip, albeit a short one, which shows him actively exiling a creator from returning

79
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,640
to the site, while also having signalled no intent to inform him.

80
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,840
There are a fair few DMs of him behaving rather coldly, and some just of him not responding

81
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,600
at all to necessary messages, although none of his supposed eruptions are recorded, I

82
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,920
do not doubt the legitimacy of the claims, either way his name is not shrouded in glory

83
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,180
throughout what is written, and on top of that it appears that he has channel awesome

84
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,500
in a stranglehold where he has partial license over the Nostalgia Critic, Doug Walker's

85
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
lifeline.

86
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,940
Now if this information is true, which I have no reason to believe it otherwise, it places

87
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,980
Doug in a very awkward ultimatum, where the main source of his income is partly in the

88
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,660
hands of someone who can practically do anything he wants, and given the illustration of this

89
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,420
character, he isn't the sort of person you'd want to entrust such a responsibility with.

90
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,060
This theory intertwines fairly well with the memo, with situations where it appears that

91
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,900
Doug was trying to act as a person to mediate, but still side with the business, with the

92
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,140
business becoming synonymous with the CEO in question, but keeping all this information

93
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,540
in mind, we have to ask ourselves what can be learned from this situation, what can we

94
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:32,380
learn from Channel Awesome?

95
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,380
Now in a way, what is written in the memo is fairly unexceptional to me, I've worked

96
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,420
five jobs in my life, two of them tried to swindle money out of me when I left, and another

97
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,940
had an adverse and unpredictable boss who was not good to work around.

98
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,700
A lot of the stories told in the Not-Saucer memo focus on that sort of environment, one

99
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,220
that many of you watching this video have probably experienced within employment.

100
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,140
So although there is more, why is it necessary that they document topics that appear to be

101
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,900
part of what you deal with when getting into a job?

102
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,900
Well it's mainly to challenge the public perception above all.

103
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,380
Channel Awesome or That Guy With The Glasses was always presented as this community, this

104
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,300
group of people who were getting along and having fun, all mates, Doug the benign overlord

105
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,140
and the management who had you in their interest, many people wanted to join.

106
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,860
I mean even when I present it like that, you'd think it's far fetched, but that's the default

107
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,740
thing we have when we think of the platforms challenging the YouTube mentality, but at

108
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,020
the end of the day, it seems that Channel Awesome was just another shell.

109
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,300
That's not particularly special, but we have this subconscious expectation of what CA should

110
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,340
be, and here is the alternate take.

111
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,260
This doesn't shock me at all, it's not something that is alien to me in fact, it's just a

112
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,540
shame that if it's true, a few bad apples, maybe even just the one, spoiled the whole

113
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,220
bunch, and ruined what could have been a genuinely surreal experience.

114
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,940
As a CEO, you often have to make tough decisions, with an element of ruthlessness to them.

115
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,620
CEOs have the highest representative proportion of psychopaths and sociopaths in those occupations,

116
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,940
in part for that reason.

117
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,380
Now I'm not saying that Michaud in this instance is a psychopath, but the revelation of a CEO

118
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,940
being particularly merciless is not a surprise to me either, and once again I emphasise that

119
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,660
not all the claims are completely substantiated, so I don't take them as a certainty, however

120
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,340
circumstantially what is written is very plausible given business and staff practice in general,

121
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,820
the fact that there are people who we might think we know through their content is irrelevant.

122
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,860
However, whereas many businesses there is a stake in the employees, there was very little

123
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,700
worth in that guy with the glasses, you see, they didn't take a stake in the income made

124
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,780
by the individual producers, and although this on principle may sound good to them,

125
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,900
it means that they were just promotional instruments, and therefore if their promotional value was

126
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,180
diminished, the management had free reign to strike them off as they pleased.

127
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,860
I think these loose working relationships were always destined to fail, especially if

128
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,300
one fell out of favour with someone like Michaud.

129
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,100
There was no binding contract, there was no legality.

130
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,420
Unless you were actually employed, there was not really much you could do in the way of

131
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,740
injustices, you're always walking a tightrope, and I think that's where the apparent contradiction

132
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,700
came in, there were clearly people who wanted to make Channel Awesome into this community,

133
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,100
the films, the collabs, but when it came down to it, there were others who weren't part

134
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,380
of that who could also pull the plug as they wished.

135
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,300
And again, having a rift in the vision of management would rarely be conducive to create

136
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,980
a wellbeing, especially when no resolve is clear.

137
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,180
I don't like a lot of businesses, that's why being self-employed isn't ideal for me.

138
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:15,040
The moment you relinquish control of what you truly want to do is the moment it becomes

139
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,700
a lot harder to realise your creative visions.

140
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,220
And that's the thing, Channel Awesome didn't necessarily feel like a business, it's not

141
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,940
an employer to many of these people, and in that way that should have put them at ease,

142
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,900
but in fact it led to their positions becoming more insecure, and when someone like Michaud

143
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,640
is around, you will always feel slightly fragile.

144
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,620
Many of the things written about in the document are common occurrences in standard businesses,

145
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,980
on YouTube even, I've seen my friends have their channels unjustifiably terminated, and

146
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,700
although they were restored, it was not a pleasant experience for them.

147
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,460
Channel Awesome was meant to be better than that, they presented themselves as better

148
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,460
than that.

149
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,580
I think that's the ultimate disappointment, that at the end of the day, it seems they

150
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,700
were no different, and in almost a way to affirm this, they put out an awful tweet where

151
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,540
they say that they regret that the producers feel this way.

152
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,920
Now if you've watched my YouTube response to fellow humans, you'll know that I have

153
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,060
no time for vague responses, and it doesn't become much vaguer than what was on show here.

154
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,340
It is simple advice, if you feel that a response is insufficient, then maybe best to hold it

155
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,540
off, because it's just self incriminating if you use phrases like, we regret that you

156
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,540
feel that way.

157
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,060
What's that even meant to imply?

158
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,620
It's a pathetic response, and listen, I understand that when such a blitz of criticisms ambushes

159
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,780
you, it's hard to know exactly how to respond, it's never easy.

160
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:31,020
But there are ways not to respond, and congratulations CA, you have perfectly executed how not to

161
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,020
respond.

162
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:36,220
And then came their second response, and this one was meant to answer the allegations directly,

163
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,640
once again it was insufficient and subjective.

164
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,500
My favourite part was how they responded to former staff member Holly Brown by just saying

165
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,540
that her allegations are not true, but not explaining why they weren't true, or presenting

166
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,780
an alternative version of events, which would be necessary.

167
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:54,940
The accusation being listed as Holly Brown makes numerous accusations is not even remotely

168
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,040
logical, do you even PR?

169
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,620
It also stated that they could quote obviously not respond to the 73 pages of allegation,

170
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,520
yes you could, if it would help your case, you should.

171
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,700
They claim they are going to answer the most egregious ones but don't even mention the

172
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,540
allegation that Michaud bullied a producer into a suicidal mindset, that one seemed pretty

173
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,780
inflammatory if you ask me.

174
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,400
I know there may be some other responses by the time this video is out, however my prediction

175
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,240
is that they will not satisfy people, as the only way to truly respond would be to present

176
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,040
alternate perspectives in each experience, and no one seems willing to do that.

177
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,080
And although I don't like writing at extra points last minute, I was just rerunning over

178
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,720
their second response and it's even worse than I thought.

179
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,440
For example, their first point is how they claim the screenshots they provided show they

180
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,940
dealt with the issue within three weeks, when all it shows is that there were three weeks

181
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,320
in between two conversations around the issue, and anyone could have been aware of it before

182
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,320
then.

183
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,200
How they think this is definitive counter evidence is beyond me and people will see

184
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,960
through it, and people have seen through it.

185
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,520
It couldn't be more corporate if it tried, and that's the issue, and that's why this

186
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,000
document is often focused on image.

187
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,200
Doug Walker is not Channel Awesome, he is Channel Awesome's PR, he is Channel Awesome's

188
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,720
presenter, and what really goes on behind the scenes is not done in the community spirit.

189
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,840
To that, you might argue, they have no obligation to, and you are completely right, they are

190
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,560
not obliged to behave in their producers best interests, but in a way, that's accepted

191
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,080
as premise in this.

192
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,840
What the document was more about was people falsely believing that it is a creator-focused

193
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
platform.

194
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,120
Now of course, there were some more exceptional situations, such as the sexual harassment

195
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,200
issues with former executive Mike Ellis, but the document doesn't necessarily focus on

196
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,960
him more on Michaud's reaction to Ellis' behaviour, which appears to be passive to say the least.

197
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,480
As Ellis is not an incumbent member of management, to focus a document on a departed member would

198
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,480
clearly undermine the intended relevance, even if it's based off old events, there are

199
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,880
still people currently in the loop.

200
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,480
Channel Awesome is a business, many of the allegations do not surprise me, we will talk

201
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,080
about the more serious ones soon.

202
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,520
However, the reason why this document surprised a lot of people, despite the mostly unremarkable

203
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,640
claims is because it contradicts the image, and images everything to a lot of these people.

204
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,280
So for such damning claims to come against the quote, good guys, is more shocking than

205
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,880
if someone complained about YouTube employees being mean to them, because Channel Awesome

206
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:13,280
were meant to be better, and they wanted to be better, and they presented themselves as

207
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:19,560
better.

208
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,160
In her testimony, former administrator Holly Brown wrote that the Walkers didn't know Michaud

209
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,480
and his associates until they approached him.

210
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,560
Now the way Brown presents it makes it look like Michaud just turned up on Walker's doorstep,

211
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,520
now I cannot say it was to that degree, however it did seem to be a fairly spontaneous business

212
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,400
venture, and if true, this is bad business practice, and we're gonna use my Discord as

213
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
an example.

214
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,240
I ran a few servers in my time, and if there's two things I've learned, it's firstly, never

215
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,520
give someone an administrator role just because they're your friends, and secondly, never

216
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,940
give someone an administrator role just because they asked for it.

217
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,940
Why is that?

218
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,680
Well the latter in this example is particularly important, because if someone is interested

219
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,960
in working for me and they just straight up ask, it is not grounds to sign away, no matter

220
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,360
how intent they may seem at the time, even if they have a plethora of reasons for why

221
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,360
you should.

222
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,380
The issue is that someone consciously trying to attain a role often means they don't present

223
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,620
themselves as who they are, especially if such effort is exerted over a short amount

224
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,620
of time.

225
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,240
The way Brown presents it implies that Michaud and his mates pretty much turned up and got

226
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,240
the job.

227
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,900
I can't say whether it's true or not, but that is how it is presented.

228
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,100
Now when he turned up he may have looked the part, and I understand that, in the moment

229
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,940
he might have seemed like the perfect candidate for the position, but human beings just do

230
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,100
not work like that.

231
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,540
You really have to see firstly how they perform when they think someone isn't looking, and

232
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,580
also how they perform over a longer stretch of time, how much they're willing to put in

233
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,700
for that next step.

234
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,560
You have to measure that genuine commitment rather than what may be masqueraded.

235
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,460
When I made my Discord server I approached a majority of admins from previous servers

236
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,120
and offered them the role, because I knew them from their own performances and I knew

237
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,900
that they weren't expecting that.

238
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,460
Now that's not possible for every occupation, and obviously someone would always have to

239
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:02,020
anticipate taking the role of CEO, but you can't just sign it away to the first person

240
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,180
who comes to you, that's playing with fire, and in this instance it seems multiple people

241
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,180
got burned.

242
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,400
And although I will not be integrating an excessive number of personal observations,

243
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,340
I must say that the original That Guy With The Glasses website layout became outdated

244
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:18,340
very quickly, and the team appear to lack any distinguishing expertise that might give

245
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,060
them an appeal that may compensate for them behaving less than respectfully.

246
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,980
What I'm saying is that even if they were a dodgy lot they may have a unique skillset,

247
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,080
some redeeming quality that gave them grounds for hire, however that was just not on display

248
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,860
when you went on the site, and judging by the numerous technical criticisms, it was

249
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,660
not on display in other areas as well.

250
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,660
Unfortunately there are a fair few sly dogs who can impress in a short term period but

251
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,340
quickly turn into the sort of character that Miss Short is portrayed as, however whereas

252
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:48,740
in my Discord I can quickly strike off who I decide unfit to handle such power, by having

253
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,080
them as the majority shareholder and shared owner of the Nostalgia Critic IP, it frankly

254
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:59,300
gave him an unhealthy amount of control, it's an inconceivable level of mishandling of responsibility,

255
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,760
even if Miss Short is not the person he has made out to be in the document.

256
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,380
The other concern is when you begin to involve numerous family or friends, which was quite

257
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,580
uncommon in Channel Awesome, nepotism can become rife, as although it may not genuinely

258
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,420
reflect who they are as people in general, having an affirmed bias towards people you

259
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,100
might have an emotional connection with is very common.

260
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,740
This does not necessarily guarantee bad management, but many often can make the false assumption

261
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,060
that because there's a level of intimacy, that person may feel more obliged to you.

262
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,740
This is true sometimes, but it's dependent on the presence of yourself.

263
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,580
As demonstrated in the memo, it's conveyed the people assigned to the roles didn't want

264
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,140
the job and were often absent from this post.

265
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,860
This is not good, and here's why.

266
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,380
In the absence of supervision, someone who is their friend or family member can firstly

267
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:45,740
levy the trust of their word, and supervisors who do not want the job do not want the conflicts

268
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,700
associated with it either, and will likely side with their friend or family member within

269
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:54,220
disagreements, as disputes in the workplace would extend a lot further on a personal basis.

270
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,140
Combined with this, the fact that the people in this situation already have considerable

271
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,520
control in the workplace, it is a recipe for disaster.

272
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,100
This is only inflamed by the fact that the producers were not bound by contract, so in

273
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,380
disputes you could just pull them from the sites.

274
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,500
In a way, I'm almost amazed more abuse didn't occur at the time.

275
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,820
The culture created through the pretense of that guy with the glasses and the mentality

276
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,340
adopted by the Walker brothers cultivated an ideal scenario for easy exploitation.

277
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,980
It's almost stupendous.

278
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,300
Regardless of what you think of the validity of the document at hand, there is something

279
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,540
fundamentally worrying about the thought of handing over the IP and shares of an asset

280
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,200
vital to your survival.

281
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,620
That seems crazy to me.

282
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,640
On the surface, it seems like disorganised, distant management, unfamiliar with the awful

283
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,400
decisions they were making, with some truly rotten eggs.

284
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,120
However, with that all said, everything irrational, everything immoral, has something that underlines

285
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,640
it, a decision that may make sense at the time, and although we could say that Michaud

286
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,240
is an unpleasant person with some degree of conviction, there's probably a lot more going

287
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,160
on behind the scenes with regards to other characters in this story.

288
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,920
If there's one thing I've learned is that even good people in bad environments can make

289
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,320
dreadful decisions.

290
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,140
Nonetheless, throughout the document, many of its authors retrospectively illustrate

291
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:05,340
themselves as starry-eyed, naive individuals, willing to take some jabs for their idols,

292
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,980
and all it takes in those situations is one slightly negative actor to take advantage

293
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,980
of that.

294
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:18,940
What message can be imparted from that onto the audience of this document?

295
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,860
Now before anyone reacts and criticises me for such a general statement, I am aware it

296
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,860
is a hyperbole.

297
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:28,180
I am not saying that you should lock yourself up and never be afraid to interact with people

298
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,180
you look up to.

299
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,180
Not at all.

300
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,220
There are certain environments in which this is perfectly reasonable.

301
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,540
However, situations with Channel Awesome are a whole different ballpark.

302
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,540
Why is that?

303
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,860
Well, you're not just meeting someone, but you're working with someone.

304
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,580
Under the premise of what can be construed as a business venture, firstly, you're almost

305
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,780
certain to go beyond their public facade.

306
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,100
That's not an inherently bad thing on principle.

307
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,140
Sometimes it's good to see how someone really operates.

308
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,540
However, businesses are by nature rooted in conflict, and situations like that of Channel

309
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,940
Awesome are not uncommon.

310
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:59,060
Nonetheless, what makes it unique is how many admire those like Doug Walker.

311
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,380
Let me give you an example.

312
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,460
Do Walmart employees join with an idolisation of Greg Penner or Doug McMillan?

313
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,460
Let's just say it's unlikely.

314
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,420
They'd probably join with a fonder view of internet sensation such as the yodelling kid.

315
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,780
But the yodelling kid isn't in cahoots with human resources.

316
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,780
That's the thing.

317
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,820
You're partially in the vicinity of a public figure, and in fact, comparably, it could

318
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,540
be considered quite intimate to the point where, even if you had a very minimal role,

319
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:24,460
you still felt like you were in some form of contact with figureheads like Doug Walker.

320
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,320
But I'd argue that's not a good thing.

321
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,620
Producers naturally require hard decisions, and having your career damaged by someone

322
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,720
who you admire can really be soul destroying.

323
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,360
A lot of these producers came in with the expectation of what Channel Awesome would

324
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,360
be.

325
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,480
This unique community, as I said earlier, Channel Awesome was meant to be different.

326
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,400
I know plenty of people who wanted to go and work there for the image that it had created.

327
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,160
However, because of this public image, when many of the producers were subjected to what

328
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,960
could be seen as maltreatment, they may have questioned it, may have placed blame on themselves,

329
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,360
and maybe asked whether their perspective was just an outcome of their actions.

330
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,640
Producers also felt fragile in their own positions, because Channel Awesome had complete prerogative

331
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,580
to remove creators from the site whenever they wished, and producers could not try and

332
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,520
challenge it, because there were no binding contracts.

333
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,260
Channel Awesome isn't necessarily an employer, but in effect, that made the situation worse.

334
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,120
It appears that Michaud came along with his own agenda and exploited producers and their

335
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,600
admiration of Doug Walker to the maximum degree.

336
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,600
And with the Nostalgia Critic IP partially under his belt, and the producers under his

337
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,200
some, it led to the alleged subsequent bullying of creators, atop a lengthy silence even after

338
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,520
many producers departed.

339
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,560
However, to take down Michaud, many of these producers would also have to lightly confront

340
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,460
their conflicting feelings about Walker and Channel Awesome, the fact that his content

341
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,920
still brings joy to many people's lives, the respect for the content that he puts out,

342
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:44,440
the question of how common these situations were, whether their situations were individual

343
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,760
experiences, whether it's worth the risk considering the overlap in their fanbase.

344
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,280
A lot of this yields from the fact that people wanted to look at an environment like Channel

345
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,520
Awesome in a positive light, and only after years of deliberation and consultation could

346
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,320
they create a remotely convincing image otherwise, one that people have undoubtedly disputed

347
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,320
regardless.

348
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,560
And that is fine.

349
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,560
That is healthy.

350
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,100
I'm not guaranteeing that everything in this document is 100% accurate.

351
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,800
If you want to question the validity in search of the truth, then more power to you.

352
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,240
But either way, there is a lot at stake for creators in this, leaving and subsequently

353
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,600
condemning a platform that, in spite of the allegations, has contributed a lot to their

354
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
career.

355
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,120
But that can't alone undermine the written expectations of these people.

356
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,760
When people say never meet your heroes, that statement alone is reductionist.

357
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,520
However, there's a reason why such an idiom exists.

358
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,200
When we watch these people from afar, they may seem great, they may seem like the ideal

359
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,360
people to have working relationships with.

360
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,980
It's just not the case, and you have to approach it with the same caution that you'd approach

361
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,940
any prospective opportunity with.

362
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,120
When that opportunity presents itself, you should really question whether you want to

363
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,280
put your own career in their hands.

364
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,200
I've had the pleasure of working with people I've admired for a long time, but I've also

365
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,640
been greatly disappointed by certain people.

366
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,760
This disappointment is something that can magnify and manifest into many different emotions

367
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,740
when you have the conditions the channel awesome presents.

368
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,840
It doesn't mean they're bad people, but even if they're good people, they may make mistakes,

369
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,760
they may involve bad people, and you might be at the receiving end of that.

370
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,440
That could really taint your dreams.

371
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,880
If you do find yourself in these situations, you have to put your innate bias towards these

372
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:20,040
people aside, you have to look at the situation independently and separate your own expectations.

373
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,120
Situational context matters, I cannot stress that enough.

374
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,520
How good or bad characters like Doug or Rob Walker are is down for you to decide, but

375
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,400
either way, if the situation is as it appears, they have made some awful mistakes, whether

376
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,920
it's not understanding the environments for making a film, handing over their vision to

377
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,140
someone with less than amiable intentions, or the numerous decisions that followed.

378
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,920
Whether they are comfortable in that position, whether they were comfortable in that position,

379
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,680
is regardless, they stayed in it, and that is the real shame.

380
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,520
These decisions appear to come from a lack of guidance, a false sense of security, and

381
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,100
supposed exploitation of the worst denominator, and a mechanism to perhaps try and justify

382
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,480
these people's decisions in their heads.

383
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,860
Michaud appears to be the villain of this tale, nonetheless, I would be intrigued to

384
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,080
hear if the Walkers have anything to say about these allegations.

385
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,780
Although they may not wish to respond, I feel that there are people still open to hearing

386
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:11,120
them out, as they are not portrayed as irredeemable in the documents.

387
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,520
To respond under the channelawesome banner with a pseudo-apology would be a grave mistake,

388
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,880
but to be honest, I don't know what's going on behind the scenes, either way, it concerns

389
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,880
me.

390
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,960
The idea that someone like Michaud, if he's as unpredictable as the document presents

391
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,340
him, having that control over a domain, and partial hold on a character that's a primary

392
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,640
source of income, makes my skin crawl.

393
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,380
Even if they may seem like the best person, be so fucking careful of who you entrust with

394
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,380
your future.

395
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,160
This situation seems beyond precarious.

396
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,080
The moral of the story is, businesses behave like businesses sometimes, and questionable

397
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,160
practice is common, however, people expected better from channelawesome.

398
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,920
People wanted better from channelawesome, because of how it presented itself.

399
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,920
If you want to set up a business or a site, don't just give it to the first person who

400
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,320
asks, and certainly don't give anything away that could be held against you as ransom in

401
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,320
the future.

402
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,960
If you are a creator, be very careful of who you work with, and what they can actually

403
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,960
do for you.

404
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,880
Do not commit yourself, and don't let them off just because you like them.

405
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,200
A wrongdoing is a wrongdoing, and do not let third parties exploit your respect for the

406
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,320
figureheads of the company, and do not let them denigrate you, you're worth more than

407
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,320
that.

408
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,040
And if you do decide to work with your idols, you're often setting yourself up for disappointments,

409
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,040
so try not to let excitement dictate your expectations.

410
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,680
Regardless of what is said, I hope that we will move closer to discovering the truth,

411
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:31,440
because if it is as it seems, although injustice will always exist in certain places, environments

412
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,920
like channelawesome can do better, and they should do better.

413
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,680
I hope that they will do better.

414
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,800
The reason it has emotionally resonated a lot more, why there's passionate disagreement

415
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,240
is because it's a more intimate community, this feels more personal.

416
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,400
It's only because people care, channelawesome has done things for people, people want it

417
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,880
to be good, and that's a powerful sentiment.

418
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,800
Doug, you've inspired many people, don't let external factors be a foil to that perception.

419
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,440
Only you know the truth of how you feel, and I hope you can convey that properly in the

420
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,440
future.

421
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,600
Your career is far from over, but I do hope you put out a response, I think it would be

422
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,600
justified.

423
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,960
And importantly, how do you, the viewer, feel?

424
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,400
What are your instincts saying about these allegations?

425
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,240
I'd love to hear your thoughts below.

426
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,840
Also, I have a new Twitter, at TheRightOpinion, rather than at RightOpinionYT.

427
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,880
I don't know if my outro will be sorted at this point about it yet, but hopefully it

428
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,880
will be soon.

429
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,880
Also, big shout out to the editors who've done a fantastic job, it's another beautiful

430
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,800
edit and I'm sure it's going to look great.

431
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,560
And make sure you go and check out the editors if you do, because a lot of them make content

432
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,560
themselves.

433
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,720
But thank you for joining me with this truly fascinating discussion, one that provokes

434
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,640
a number of interesting questions.

435
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,920
However, until those questions are answered, I'm TheRightOpinion, and I'll see you in

436
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,440
the next one.
