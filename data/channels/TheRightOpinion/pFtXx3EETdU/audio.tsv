0	2000	Only in Russia
7280	13000	Hello ladies and gentlemen welcome to the right opinion the home of a twat with too much free time and today we talk about Russia
13000	18520	The delightful place in which all men are free unless you're a gay or a Pokemon player in a church
18520	19160	Then you're fucked
19160	23640	But the point still stands Russia is a country where you can do some pretty crazy shit
23640	28140	And what better way to exploit that spirit than by starting up your own real hunger games
28140	30420	I know it sounds too good to be true
30420	35820	But I can tell you that in Siberia they will be indulging themselves in just that before having it broadcast on Russian television
35900	38420	Now so you may thinking what are the hunger games?
38420	42340	Well for those who've been living under a rock and because I don't have the patience to spell it out
42340	47480	I'm passing it over to my good friend and editor youtuber to explain it all in 60 seconds. Take it away
48900	55300	The Hunger Games is a poorly put together knockoff of a Japanese movie called Battle Royale and a novella called the lottery and it takes place
55300	61120	In a world in which our universe has collided with that of the spy kids 3d universe now long story short the people of white
61120	66420	North Korea are starving and poor that is except of course for some people who live in a place called the capital who for some
66420	69820	Reason like to watch poor children butcher each other in some kind of Truman show style
70100	72980	gladiatorial event known as the Hunger Games because why the fuck not
73020	78380	So anyway once a year some sort of circus clown comes to town and draws the name of children out of a fishbowl or something
78380	82020	Those children then have to go and fight for survival in the Hunger Games for some reason
82020	86740	But not before a poorly green-screen ceremony announced by some sort of creepy human cartoon hybrid monster
86740	89420	The type of which is born out of my nightmares to sum it all up
89420	93300	It's a terrible movie about kids killing each other for sport as old men watch it on the telly
93300	95700	The plot is fucking ridiculous in all honesty
95700	100820	The series is so directionless and ex machina that even though I've read all the fucking books and watched all the fucking movies
100820	107100	I had to Google the fucking point. It's a Frankenstein monster of plagiarism and the characters are cliche. Don't watch this movie
107100	110820	Don't read the books. I give the Hunger Games three inches out of eight
112380	118260	Thank you very much youtuber and his link will be in the description below very talented guy got the gist good
118580	124180	If not, watch it again. I'm not virtue enough to sit down here and have a lesson on the history onyx of such fiction
124180	125580	I'm sure many of you are thinking to yourself
125580	128220	But how will they get away with committing such crimes?
128380	132780	The truth is they won't in fact all laws of the Russian Federation applied during the Hunger Games
132780	136780	It's just you can go to jail and know that once you get out on parole in 70 years
136780	139420	You'll be able to live the last few in tranquility
139420	143860	Also, if something goes wrong, you can hit the panic button to be rescued. So they've changed that bit slightly
143860	149360	I'm sure to everyone's disappointment. So for example rape it's completely allowed, but it's also illegal
149360	152140	So basically it's just a way to absolve the organizers of any responsibility
152940	158860	Also, I have a few questions. So for example, if they're being raped and they hit the panic button what happens?
158860	162820	I mean any threat at all like fucking fighting a buddy Siberian bear
162820	166740	I mean, I know Russians aren't really ones for cowardice, but still it's not very logical
167180	169980	Basically they wanted to be as edgy as possible
169980	174100	But they had social norms to adhere to which led to this very icky premise of something
174100	176780	That's either going to be terribly disappointing or terribly immoral
176780	179740	So people are saying this and they'll probably enjoy it especially Russians
179740	184620	I feel like I should be angry at this and I actually am it's inherently immoral almost insane and things that are a lot less
184700	187380	Important have pissed me off in the past and probably will in the future
187380	190460	But my thoughts are if people are actually willing to sign up to do it
190460	191580	Then it's their funeral
191580	193140	literally natural selection in
193140	197520	Perfect function if Russia are gonna be mad enough to host something like this and people are gonna be mad enough to
197660	202780	Participate in something like this with the risk of dying or going to jail anyway with the very distant prospect of winning money
202780	204260	Then they can fucking do it
204260	211840	But knowing everything it will be reserved Lee quiet because I'm a miserable cynical cunt and everything's disappointing these days
212300	217660	Whether that's a good thing though in this context or a bad thing can be left for you to decide for all I know
217740	221900	Maybe mr. Putin will pardon them. Maybe he has some sympathies for the Hunger Games
221900	226500	We'll have to see I'm the right opinion and only in Russia
