1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Only in Russia

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello ladies and gentlemen welcome to the right opinion the home of a twat with too much free time and today we talk about Russia

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,520
The delightful place in which all men are free unless you're a gay or a Pokemon player in a church

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,160
Then you're fucked

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,640
But the point still stands Russia is a country where you can do some pretty crazy shit

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,140
And what better way to exploit that spirit than by starting up your own real hunger games

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,420
I know it sounds too good to be true

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,820
But I can tell you that in Siberia they will be indulging themselves in just that before having it broadcast on Russian television

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,420
Now so you may thinking what are the hunger games?

10
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,340
Well for those who've been living under a rock and because I don't have the patience to spell it out

11
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,480
I'm passing it over to my good friend and editor youtuber to explain it all in 60 seconds. Take it away

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:55,300
The Hunger Games is a poorly put together knockoff of a Japanese movie called Battle Royale and a novella called the lottery and it takes place

13
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:01,120
In a world in which our universe has collided with that of the spy kids 3d universe now long story short the people of white

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,420
North Korea are starving and poor that is except of course for some people who live in a place called the capital who for some

15
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,820
Reason like to watch poor children butcher each other in some kind of Truman show style

16
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,980
gladiatorial event known as the Hunger Games because why the fuck not

17
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,380
So anyway once a year some sort of circus clown comes to town and draws the name of children out of a fishbowl or something

18
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,020
Those children then have to go and fight for survival in the Hunger Games for some reason

19
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,740
But not before a poorly green-screen ceremony announced by some sort of creepy human cartoon hybrid monster

20
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,420
The type of which is born out of my nightmares to sum it all up

21
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,300
It's a terrible movie about kids killing each other for sport as old men watch it on the telly

22
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,700
The plot is fucking ridiculous in all honesty

23
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,820
The series is so directionless and ex machina that even though I've read all the fucking books and watched all the fucking movies

24
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:47,100
I had to Google the fucking point. It's a Frankenstein monster of plagiarism and the characters are cliche. Don't watch this movie

25
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,820
Don't read the books. I give the Hunger Games three inches out of eight

26
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:58,260
Thank you very much youtuber and his link will be in the description below very talented guy got the gist good

27
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:04,180
If not, watch it again. I'm not virtue enough to sit down here and have a lesson on the history onyx of such fiction

28
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,580
I'm sure many of you are thinking to yourself

29
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,220
But how will they get away with committing such crimes?

30
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,780
The truth is they won't in fact all laws of the Russian Federation applied during the Hunger Games

31
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,780
It's just you can go to jail and know that once you get out on parole in 70 years

32
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,420
You'll be able to live the last few in tranquility

33
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,860
Also, if something goes wrong, you can hit the panic button to be rescued. So they've changed that bit slightly

34
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:29,360
I'm sure to everyone's disappointment. So for example rape it's completely allowed, but it's also illegal

35
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,140
So basically it's just a way to absolve the organizers of any responsibility

36
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:38,860
Also, I have a few questions. So for example, if they're being raped and they hit the panic button what happens?

37
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,820
I mean any threat at all like fucking fighting a buddy Siberian bear

38
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,740
I mean, I know Russians aren't really ones for cowardice, but still it's not very logical

39
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,980
Basically they wanted to be as edgy as possible

40
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,100
But they had social norms to adhere to which led to this very icky premise of something

41
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,780
That's either going to be terribly disappointing or terribly immoral

42
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,740
So people are saying this and they'll probably enjoy it especially Russians

43
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:04,620
I feel like I should be angry at this and I actually am it's inherently immoral almost insane and things that are a lot less

44
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,380
Important have pissed me off in the past and probably will in the future

45
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,460
But my thoughts are if people are actually willing to sign up to do it

46
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,580
Then it's their funeral

47
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,140
literally natural selection in

48
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,520
Perfect function if Russia are gonna be mad enough to host something like this and people are gonna be mad enough to

49
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,780
Participate in something like this with the risk of dying or going to jail anyway with the very distant prospect of winning money

50
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,260
Then they can fucking do it

51
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:31,840
But knowing everything it will be reserved Lee quiet because I'm a miserable cynical cunt and everything's disappointing these days

52
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,660
Whether that's a good thing though in this context or a bad thing can be left for you to decide for all I know

53
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,900
Maybe mr. Putin will pardon them. Maybe he has some sympathies for the Hunger Games

54
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,500
We'll have to see I'm the right opinion and only in Russia
