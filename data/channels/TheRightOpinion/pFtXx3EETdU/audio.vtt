00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Only in Russia

00:07.280 --> 00:13.000
Hello ladies and gentlemen welcome to the right opinion the home of a twat with too much free time and today we talk about Russia

00:13.000 --> 00:18.520
The delightful place in which all men are free unless you're a gay or a Pokemon player in a church

00:18.520 --> 00:19.160
Then you're fucked

00:19.160 --> 00:23.640
But the point still stands Russia is a country where you can do some pretty crazy shit

00:23.640 --> 00:28.140
And what better way to exploit that spirit than by starting up your own real hunger games

00:28.140 --> 00:30.420
I know it sounds too good to be true

00:30.420 --> 00:35.820
But I can tell you that in Siberia they will be indulging themselves in just that before having it broadcast on Russian television

00:35.900 --> 00:38.420
Now so you may thinking what are the hunger games?

00:38.420 --> 00:42.340
Well for those who've been living under a rock and because I don't have the patience to spell it out

00:42.340 --> 00:47.480
I'm passing it over to my good friend and editor youtuber to explain it all in 60 seconds. Take it away

00:48.900 --> 00:55.300
The Hunger Games is a poorly put together knockoff of a Japanese movie called Battle Royale and a novella called the lottery and it takes place

00:55.300 --> 01:01.120
In a world in which our universe has collided with that of the spy kids 3d universe now long story short the people of white

01:01.120 --> 01:06.420
North Korea are starving and poor that is except of course for some people who live in a place called the capital who for some

01:06.420 --> 01:09.820
Reason like to watch poor children butcher each other in some kind of Truman show style

01:10.100 --> 01:12.980
gladiatorial event known as the Hunger Games because why the fuck not

01:13.020 --> 01:18.380
So anyway once a year some sort of circus clown comes to town and draws the name of children out of a fishbowl or something

01:18.380 --> 01:22.020
Those children then have to go and fight for survival in the Hunger Games for some reason

01:22.020 --> 01:26.740
But not before a poorly green-screen ceremony announced by some sort of creepy human cartoon hybrid monster

01:26.740 --> 01:29.420
The type of which is born out of my nightmares to sum it all up

01:29.420 --> 01:33.300
It's a terrible movie about kids killing each other for sport as old men watch it on the telly

01:33.300 --> 01:35.700
The plot is fucking ridiculous in all honesty

01:35.700 --> 01:40.820
The series is so directionless and ex machina that even though I've read all the fucking books and watched all the fucking movies

01:40.820 --> 01:47.100
I had to Google the fucking point. It's a Frankenstein monster of plagiarism and the characters are cliche. Don't watch this movie

01:47.100 --> 01:50.820
Don't read the books. I give the Hunger Games three inches out of eight

01:52.380 --> 01:58.260
Thank you very much youtuber and his link will be in the description below very talented guy got the gist good

01:58.580 --> 02:04.180
If not, watch it again. I'm not virtue enough to sit down here and have a lesson on the history onyx of such fiction

02:04.180 --> 02:05.580
I'm sure many of you are thinking to yourself

02:05.580 --> 02:08.220
But how will they get away with committing such crimes?

02:08.380 --> 02:12.780
The truth is they won't in fact all laws of the Russian Federation applied during the Hunger Games

02:12.780 --> 02:16.780
It's just you can go to jail and know that once you get out on parole in 70 years

02:16.780 --> 02:19.420
You'll be able to live the last few in tranquility

02:19.420 --> 02:23.860
Also, if something goes wrong, you can hit the panic button to be rescued. So they've changed that bit slightly

02:23.860 --> 02:29.360
I'm sure to everyone's disappointment. So for example rape it's completely allowed, but it's also illegal

02:29.360 --> 02:32.140
So basically it's just a way to absolve the organizers of any responsibility

02:32.940 --> 02:38.860
Also, I have a few questions. So for example, if they're being raped and they hit the panic button what happens?

02:38.860 --> 02:42.820
I mean any threat at all like fucking fighting a buddy Siberian bear

02:42.820 --> 02:46.740
I mean, I know Russians aren't really ones for cowardice, but still it's not very logical

02:47.180 --> 02:49.980
Basically they wanted to be as edgy as possible

02:49.980 --> 02:54.100
But they had social norms to adhere to which led to this very icky premise of something

02:54.100 --> 02:56.780
That's either going to be terribly disappointing or terribly immoral

02:56.780 --> 02:59.740
So people are saying this and they'll probably enjoy it especially Russians

02:59.740 --> 03:04.620
I feel like I should be angry at this and I actually am it's inherently immoral almost insane and things that are a lot less

03:04.700 --> 03:07.380
Important have pissed me off in the past and probably will in the future

03:07.380 --> 03:10.460
But my thoughts are if people are actually willing to sign up to do it

03:10.460 --> 03:11.580
Then it's their funeral

03:11.580 --> 03:13.140
literally natural selection in

03:13.140 --> 03:17.520
Perfect function if Russia are gonna be mad enough to host something like this and people are gonna be mad enough to

03:17.660 --> 03:22.780
Participate in something like this with the risk of dying or going to jail anyway with the very distant prospect of winning money

03:22.780 --> 03:24.260
Then they can fucking do it

03:24.260 --> 03:31.840
But knowing everything it will be reserved Lee quiet because I'm a miserable cynical cunt and everything's disappointing these days

03:32.300 --> 03:37.660
Whether that's a good thing though in this context or a bad thing can be left for you to decide for all I know

03:37.740 --> 03:41.900
Maybe mr. Putin will pardon them. Maybe he has some sympathies for the Hunger Games

03:41.900 --> 03:46.500
We'll have to see I'm the right opinion and only in Russia
