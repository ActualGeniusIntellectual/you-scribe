0	13860	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,
13860	21260	and families, my god, do I love families, whoop whoop whoop. Humor aside, the family is an important staple in the many
21260	26880	societies that we do indeed live in. As a concept, it has been around for longer than I can remember, and although
26880	32000	many of us do have various goals, there are many people who would just like to settle down with a partner who loves
32000	37600	them and raise a few kids. It's a completely fair perspective, and one that I hope people have the opportunity to
37600	43560	fulfil. It's definitely something that I would like to do at one point in my life, though I'm not entirely sure when.
43560	49280	However, I think many of us have a very idealised version of how these things would play out, and although it often
49280	56160	takes a few attempts to get it right, and a few more for some, and a few more for others, maybe a few more on top of
56160	62140	that, it's still something we like to hold on to, which is where the idea of family vlogging comes into play.
62140	68440	Vlogs appeal to the audience under the notion that they can represent a life that we may idolise and feel an affinity with,
68440	73960	that's what has made so many of these wealthy vloggers famous from the start. However, it's important that these people
73960	79240	can place themselves in the vloggers position, and that the life they envision can be channelled through a relatable
79240	85440	individual. There was a time when a majority of audiences on YouTube liked to envision their lives as the sweet, wholesome
85440	91360	ones that will one day be blessed with the same glorious tidings that so many of those lovely vloggers have earned
91360	97440	themselves. However, at some point in the last few years, I've noticed a shift. I noted it in my Emma Chamberlain video,
97440	103880	that hey, I guess people are feeling kinda cynical now, and I mean who can blame them, the world is a depressing place,
103880	110440	and I guess everyone is just kind of in that mood, and out of that rose a new line up of stars who were slightly more
110440	116600	controversial than the previous ones. There are positives and negatives to this, but at least it gives us something to talk
116600	123840	about. Now, this didn't have to be particularly negative in a way, it just meant slightly more loud, obnoxious, and less subtle.
123840	127240	We're gonna make her worst nightmare come true.
127240	133160	This was a case in every genre, and eventually the penny dropped in the family genre too. You know, you don't have to pretend
133160	140040	that everything's perfect, how about conflict and storm? People love melodrama, you just need energy, some ideas,
140040	147040	a bit of money, and of course, a partner and a kid. I mean, hey, they can't be too hard to find, especially if you're as dashing
147040	149520	as the man known as Austin McBroom.
149520	155680	Austin McBroom- I enjoy catching the ball, I enjoy just having a blast with the teammates on the field and off the field.
155680	162880	Oh yeah. Austin McBroom is the husband and father of the Ace family, now he is an individual who is obviously known
162880	169280	primarily on YouTube. However, at one point, it seemed his career was not destined there, as that clip showed he was a very
169320	175560	sporting-oriented individual, and was highly rated in the basketball scene, and to be fair, the dude had some moves,
175560	181760	he could shoot some hoops. Given his prominence, you could say he was kinda a low-key media figure, he had a previously
181760	188160	established audience due to his skills, and here's an old screenshot of his 2015 twitter long before the launch of his
188160	195160	YouTube channel, which had his three principles listed in his biography, one god, two family, three hoop.
195400	201440	A simple set of beliefs that had guided him to relative success in the basketball scene, and a tendency to write
201440	207240	inspirational tweets. One of the elements that was very noticeable on his twitter prior to the creation of his channel
207240	213120	was the love of his fiance Catherine. They had a fairly standard story behind them, they saw each other a couple times,
213120	219080	and then decided that actually they had feelings which led them to initiating this relationship and the subsequent birthing
219080	224480	of their daughter Elle. The run-up to their child had a fair bit of coverage on twitter, and a nice bit of hype
224480	230040	surrounding it, so I guess at that point they decided that their life was interesting enough to start a YouTube channel.
230040	238120	Hey guys, welcome to our YouTube channel, this is our first Q&A, you guys sent us a bunch of questions that we picked out.
238120	243760	Now, when I looked at their old content, and I saw that their first video was a Q&A, I thought they were pulling my leg,
243760	249240	that's some bullsey confidence in your character to open your channel with a Q&A video. Now, from looking at an old
249240	254440	social blade screenshot, it's possible that they had some other videos up, but deleted them before launch,
254440	259480	so I guess they just used the already existent clout that they had surrounding Austin's basketball career,
259480	265040	and his relationship to launch the channel. They originally were called the incredible name of Austin and Catherine Vlogs,
265040	271520	before changing it to the Ace family, Ace representing the initials of each family member's name, Austin, Catherine, and Elle.
271520	276960	They do have another child now, Elle, but I guess the Ace family didn't quite have the same ring to it.
276960	283400	They started off on a fair wave of momentum, and have since built on that, accumulating over 17 million subscribers,
283400	289360	in the space of three and a half years. So what's the big deal? Family vlogs are here to stay.
289360	296000	Well, although vloggers have always taken on their fair share of drama, there seems to be something more about the Ace family,
296040	303040	and even more specifically, the man of the house, Austin McBroom, in that he may not be practicing what he preaches,
303040	306840	and treating those around him with the respect that may be expected.
306840	310640	After all, this family is a family who's very grateful.
310640	317440	Austin McBroom- Living life to the fullest, like we're keeping God first, being good people, and just trying our best to inspire others.
318440	325800	We're doing our best, as far as using our platform in order to do greater things, and inspire people,
325800	331200	and that's really how we feel every single day, and like, we just get so excited to do things for people,
331200	335400	and if you can't already tell, like, that's just in our nature, and that's what we love to do.
335400	341760	A family grateful for many things, but sometimes more than words is necessary to convince people that you believe it,
341800	349520	and that is what has been in question over the last couple years, ultimately climaxing in a situation very recently involving much more serious claims,
349520	352800	although I have a lot to say about the validity of those.
352800	358720	This is not going to be just about Austin, in fact, Catherine is probably going to be receiving a fair bit of scrutiny as well,
358720	362520	so don't worry, everyone's going to receive their fair share of discourse.
362520	367720	Let's have a discussion to see if the Ace family are really as ace as they've proclaimed to be,
367720	372120	or if behind the candelabra, they're not quite the role models that many see them as.
372120	375960	Well, fellas, I'm ready to get up and do my thing, I wanna get into it, man, you know?
375960	382200	And yes, that was a James Brown reference, because, well, I'm a sex machine. Let's go.
385400	387520	I want to start off this part with a quick disclaimer.
387520	393640	If there's one red flag that will immediately make me question a creator's desire to produce realistic organic content,
393680	394840	it's the notion of pranks.
394840	398800	Now, of course, not just any pranks, I'm sure there are some great pranks out there,
398800	405800	but you know, that brand of prank that I'm talking about, Roman Atwood, FouseyTube, Joey Salads, Prank Invasion, all that jazz.
405800	410000	The reason that I make this statement is because for many of you YouTube veterans,
410000	412960	you will know that these pranks were all blatantly fake.
412960	419920	The reason for making these pranks fake was because there was never a standard presented by an audience that we'd expect them to make the content genuine.
419920	422720	People valued the stunt over the sentiment behind it.
422720	426560	On top of this, the fakeness ensured the safety of the individual involved,
426560	432040	particularly when they partook in inflammatory stunts which may cause emotional harm to another individual.
432040	435680	Now, honestly, the Ace Family were probably far from the worst in this area,
435680	439600	and the topics that they faked probably didn't have many social repercussions,
439600	442880	but when I found out that a lot of their most viewed videos were pranks,
442880	447720	and seeing it as how they kicked off their channel, I started to become a bit concerned.
447720	450320	I don't have much confidence in these channels because honestly,
450320	455880	I believe that any channel prepared to sell an audience's pranks won't shy away from selling the audience anything else.
455880	460640	However, it is a case of positive proof, and I am a judgmental person in this instance,
460640	465000	but my first impressions of the family were not optimistic to say the least.
465000	471800	One of my concerns with channels that fake these things is that they don't really have much concern for their actual relationship with their audience,
471800	478480	and only care about how the audience sees them, which allows them to partake in exploitive behaviours that the audience overlooks.
478480	483560	This is one of the running criticisms when I was accumulating a list of topics that were on the chopping board today,
483560	487960	that they pretend to care, and actually just exploit the relationship whenever they can,
487960	492480	which is a pretty cynical perspective, but once again, to fulfil such a claim, we need proof.
492480	497160	Let's talk about the incidents that have drawn this criticism, starting with their charity work.
497160	504440	To many audiences, charity work seems like an unmitigated positive, those who engage in charitable behaviour are often praised,
504480	512520	and rightly so. However, for the very cynical people, they may see charity as a phony way for a creator to try and gain reputation points,
512520	516160	which may lead to more negative exploitation in the future.
516160	521880	Now generally, I don't like to side with the latter perspective, because these sorts of things, even if they're stunts,
521880	531160	can bring a lot of positive attention to good causes, but I also have to note as a premise that doing charity work does not make you an inherently good or trustworthy person,
531160	534200	which is where we look at the Ace Family's charity work.
534200	541400	And lastly, to spice it up a little bit, the person I picked for the one-on-one competition, after he's done taking an L, we're gonna play five-on-five.
541400	549000	He will pick his four other guys, and I will pick my four other guys, and the winner of that game will receive a $100,000 check to donate to charity.
549000	554200	Each player on that team will get a portion of the money to donate to their charity of choice, and guys, that's the best part about this event,
554200	557720	is to be able to give back. To us, there's nothing better in the world than to give back.
557800	565080	The Ace Family love to give back, and so when they announced that they were hosting a charity basketball event in June 2018,
565080	574360	obviously, in the spirit of Austin's game of choice, people were excited. As heard, the winner of the game would receive $100,000 to donate to charity,
574360	584040	a very noble cause indeed. The event came around, it was a huge success, it seemed that people had a great time, and they even donated that $75,000?
584120	590200	Alrighty then. This caught fairly immediate criticism, as it was not the amount they had originally pledged to donate.
590200	597640	Many theorised that given the sales, they should have made over $500,000 from the event, but others argued that given the costs,
597640	604680	it is possible that $75,000 was actually a reasonable amount to donate, and besides, $75,000 was better than nothing,
604680	611240	any sort of discussion around how much they made is very grey, and so it's hard to tally up cost-profit margins.
611240	619160	However, if I was in their shoes, given the money involved, if the donation fell short, I probably would have just filled in the remaining money myself,
619160	626280	or at least tried to explain to my audience the situation. The closest they get to doing that is this clip from what I understand.
626280	632600	They took $11 from each ticket for ambulances to be there on spot.
632600	638280	But even then, the explanation is rather insufficient, as pointed out by epic YouTuber Pyrocynical.
638280	645880	So let's take $11 off each ticket, but that's still a fraction of the possible profit he made compared to the money he gave away.
645880	652360	Also, he might have even hired the stadium for a discounted price, or even for free, because this was a charity event.
652360	653240	But I like money.
653240	659160	And regardless, you want to honour your commitment to charity, they were selling merch at like $65 a piece at the event,
659160	666440	and I feel they could have afforded it. I'm sure the money went to the right cause, I just sincerely hope they did donate every last cent,
666440	669640	because the next few events may make you doubt that they did.
669640	676360	Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, well, shame on me, but still, significant amount of shame on you too.
676360	682280	And once again, the source of the controversy came from a basketball event, involving $100,000.
682280	685080	I mean, it's like they're baiting their audience at this point.
685080	690360	So in this video, Oster announces he's doing another giveaway, this time actually $100,000,
690360	695320	and he'll be giving it to anyone who can shoot 10 consecutive hoops in a basketball competition.
695320	699240	It sounds pretty easy to me. If you think you can do it, hit us up.
699240	702840	If you think your favourite YouTuber or celebrity can do it, make sure you tag them.
702840	705880	I also put the video on my Instagram, so make sure you tag them in the comments.
705880	708920	Guys, it's a free $100,000, you don't have to pay to enter.
708920	716520	Although, we suggest, it's up to you, but we suggest whoever wins, donates a portion to charity.
716520	718600	You all know, Catherine, I love giving back.
718600	721640	Now, given the rather general language, him talking about YouTubes,
721640	726040	but also talking about anyone who thinks they're good enough, in both his video and his announcement tweet,
726040	729560	you'd expect this competition to be open to anyone, right? Wrong.
729560	735240	Austin just listed 20 already fairly wealthy individuals who definitely weren't just randomly selected.
735240	738360	It kinda sucked, and to add insult to injury during the competition,
738360	743160	he invites one of his other basketball playing friends down who wasn't even on the original list to play,
743160	747800	and that guy wins it. $100,000, which once again, doesn't mean much to anyone.
747800	750760	People were fairly annoyed, because they did feel misled,
750760	754120	not because he actively stated that he was going to be inviting his fans,
754120	759560	but because he has shown in the past that he is completely capable of clarifying when he only wants influencers,
759560	761320	such as the last basketball game.
761320	765560	What that means is, I am going to challenge anyone with a support system,
765560	773320	whether that be a YouTuber, whether that be a celebrity, whether that be an artist, whether that be a baby.
773320	779240	So basically, you want to play against someone who has a fan base, that can bring a fan base?
779240	779960	Yes.
779960	781320	Someone that has support?
781320	781880	Yes.
781880	784280	When he said the competition was open to people,
784280	789320	people had the impression that he would be inviting anyone, thus imposing these false expectations.
789320	795000	The only comment that could remotely be interpreted in the direction of saying it's more influence-focused is this one.
795000	798360	So this is a new year. Everyone wants the new year to be better than the last year,
798360	802360	so our first video in the new year was a video dedicated to all of our ace family members.
802360	806120	So now we want to do something fun and entertaining for the social media world.
806120	812040	After watching this around five times, I came to the conclusion that he was implying this would be focused away from the fans,
812040	818040	but it was a vaguely delivered statement, and in the context of the whole video, you'd completely receive a different impression.
818040	822120	Again, it's not a huge deal, it's just strange why he didn't seek to make it clearer,
822120	828120	maybe because he thought it wouldn't be high enough stakes if everyone already knew that a rich person was winning 100,000?
828120	831880	Maybe he's just bad at explaining things without Catherine there.
831960	836280	Nonetheless, it's not a huge deal, he can quickly clear it up, right?
836280	844280	I didn't expect to find any of Austin's response, but I did, and now I understand why he doesn't normally respond,
844280	849800	because wow, that's a bad response. It's hard to work out exactly what he's saying here or the logic,
849800	854440	but he basically seems insulted that people have a problem when he's done so much,
854440	860360	and that if you're a true ace family member, you must appreciate everything else the mighty Austin McBroom does,
860360	862600	and take no issue with his decisions.
862600	868360	His other response was at the end of the charity video, to the criticism that everyone was rich, so they didn't need money.
868360	873560	Man, it feels so good to like, cause a lot of people kept saying, yo, give it to someone who needs it,
873560	877960	like they kept saying, everyone in the event, you know, makes a lot of money, so they don't need it.
877960	883160	Guys, you don't know what people's situations are, so you don't know how much someone makes at all, right?
883160	888600	But for someone who actually really needed it, I picked someone out of the stands that wasn't even in the contest,
888600	891640	just because we really wanted to give it away, and I felt like he had a good shot.
891640	898040	Next thing you know, he wins, okay? That's dope, that's such a cool story.
898040	899640	Fair enough, I guess.
899640	903800	Well, once again, the problem arose with the fact that this comment seemed purposely dishonest,
903800	911320	as the winner, Austin Mills, is the son of Jade Mills, a luxury real estate agent who has over 5 billion in sales.
911320	915720	Now, I cannot comment on a son's relationship with his ostensibly rich mother,
915720	919400	but it definitely made McBroom's comments look a bit ridiculous.
919400	924200	It's the Ace Family's channel, but the behaviour surrounding the stunt seemed insulting to the audience's
924200	930360	intelligence, arrogant, and all around a bit mean-spirited, and for someone who's so humble and intent on giving back,
930360	934920	you'd think he wouldn't react as if he was a god who felt people went praying enough to him.
934920	940040	Why would it be so hard to apologise for a misunderstanding that seemed honestly purposely vague?
940040	942200	I don't know, let's talk about it more.
945720	957640	One of the things that I've noticed is that when being faced down with serious criticism,
957640	962440	the Ace Family doesn't really like talking about it, and when they do, it's typically not with the most finesse.
962440	967880	They have two options, they can respond, which we've partly observed already, or they can ignore and elicit sympathy
967880	974680	through what may appear to be unrelated methods, but honestly, I'm not sure if they're as coincidental as one might assume.
974680	977800	Let's begin with the former, how they act when they respond.
977800	981880	I've already criticised them for their response to people's annoyance about the basketball game,
981880	987160	which although not the biggest deal, did demonstrate a lack of competence, but there is another great situation
987160	990840	which once again illuminates this, and probably a few more points as well.
990840	998760	We've been getting a lot of comments lately, asking us what happened, what happened with the Ace Family
998760	1007800	in this truck, so we just wanted to address it, and let you guys hear first hand from our mouths, what really happened.
1007800	1013720	This is one involving an individual by the name of Urban Trademark 7, he's a designer, he makes some pretty slick designs,
1013720	1016040	and he felt that McBroom had ripped him off.
1016040	1022360	I guess, you know, he came across the merchandise again and he bought a couple items, and he had asked Bobby like,
1022360	1028680	yeah, do you know the dude that makes these, and Bobby, I guess, told him like, yeah, you know, I know him,
1028680	1035080	but all his information is on the label, so if you wanna reach out to him, you know, that's Instagram,
1035080	1041480	and all his contacts is on there, so he reached out from the text messages that I post, and I was like,
1041480	1045880	for sure, let's link up and try to put something together then.
1045880	1050520	To explain in a bit more depth, it appears that Austin had seen and purchased some of Urban's designs
1050520	1055320	while out and about in local stores, and had asked after him. Apparently, he really liked the designs,
1055320	1060040	and had fans who he felt would appreciate some merchandise made in the style of that content.
1060040	1066280	So then from there, I was like, alright, well, what I can do is I can make a couple exclusively for you,
1066280	1071160	and then we can sell them, and then, you know, when I link back up, I'll make them, when I link back up,
1071160	1072760	we can negotiate like the price.
1072760	1077480	So they decide to convene and discuss the prospects of working on some collaborative content.
1077480	1082760	So it appears that they were going to work on some designs together before finalising the financial side of it.
1082760	1087400	There's also something about a colouring book that I think Urban wanted McBroom to promote as well,
1087400	1091720	one that he gifted to McBroom's daughter, although McBroom didn't want to take a picture with him,
1091720	1095000	which he found suspicious due to disassociation in a way.
1095000	1099320	So yeah, so I'm like, oh, I'm gonna give a... Intensely, I was just like, I'm gonna give a book to his daughter,
1099320	1104360	cause I made the book for my daughter, that's what inspired me, and I'm like, he has a little one,
1104360	1106840	so I want to give her a colouring book.
1106840	1113240	So on my way out, when we got to the car, I give him the colouring book, and I'm like, hey, you know,
1113240	1117800	this is for your daughter, you know, just give it to her if you can, you know, take a picture,
1117800	1120280	you know, just trying to promote the book for kids.
1120280	1123640	He was like, he was like, dope, that's for sure, I got you.
1123640	1126200	And I was like, do you mind if I get a picture with you with the book?
1126200	1131880	He instantly like froze up for a second, was like, nah, nah, let's just wait, man, I only take professional pictures.
1131880	1133320	And I was like, all right, for sure.
1133320	1137720	The conversation continued over the following days, with Urban presenting the designs to McBroom,
1137720	1139880	who said he'd been busy. What was he busy with?
1139880	1143880	Well, allegedly copping Urban's own designs, and then selling them himself,
1143880	1149400	even one regarding an ice cream truck that the Ace Family allegedly nabbed for one of their subscriber specials
1149400	1151000	just under a year later.
1151000	1157800	And then a couple days later, I seen on YouTube, he had on the band, some bands that looked like my bands,
1157800	1159000	with him and his daughter.
1159000	1160360	They was mad thicc.
1160360	1163320	They was mad thicc, they wasn't, I just know my work.
1163320	1167160	And I was like, I was like, Lika, come here, look at this.
1167160	1169880	And she's like, nah, nah, nah.
1169880	1174760	And then, so then I basically, that's what you see from the text, I hit him up.
1174760	1177560	I'm like, bro, what's up with this?
1177560	1183000	Those messages when we were put here is basically what inspired, you know, transpired.
1183000	1183880	People do that, man.
1183880	1192040	People get really influenced and rip you off so fast that I'm not the only one that's been done too, I'm pretty sure.
1192040	1196920	But, so I kind of like, I took it with a grain of salt.
1196920	1201080	Another thing was dope is I'm working on a truck that I'm about to drop,
1201080	1207720	that we can like basically do pop-ups where every band that I make exclusively for you,
1207720	1212040	we pop up, we could sell them, and then, you know, it's love.
1212040	1215960	So I tell him the whole get down about the truck and how I used to have a store,
1215960	1218040	and now I feel like mobile is the new wave.
1218680	1222440	And like, you know, and he's like, oh man, that shit is like, that shit sound genius.
1222440	1223720	I felt some type of way.
1224360	1230600	And that's when I was like, oh, nah, I gotta, I gotta expose this dude because, you know,
1230600	1235480	and then when it's crazy, because when I posted about the truck, people was hitting me up mad DMs,
1235480	1238120	like, you're not the only one he ripped off.
1238120	1241080	They had a subsequent confrontation and Instagram DMs,
1241080	1244120	and Urban felt provoked eventually into making a video
1244120	1247320	with the publication of this ice cream truck instant.
1247320	1250840	It's hard to exactly measure the verifiability of these claims.
1250840	1255320	It appears that a lot of what was said was true about the circumstances surrounding it.
1255320	1258440	The difficulties come into the fact that it's difficult to exactly argue
1258440	1263240	how much was plagiarized in a way and how much McBroom just decided to do in his own style.
1263240	1267320	But regardless, it's a shame they couldn't communicate these differences more effectively.
1267320	1270440	And the whole ice cream truck scenario is a bit suspicious,
1270440	1273720	though because the vagueness in the language in the DMs that I've seen,
1273720	1276760	it's difficult to once again say exactly what's gone on.
1276760	1278680	No one really admits to much.
1278680	1281240	However, as said, this was about response.
1281240	1285080	And once again, Austin demonstrated his exceptional class.
1285080	1287160	Saw some headbands, hit him up, wanted to collab.
1287160	1291880	He didn't want to collab with me because he tried to say that the headbands were expensive.
1292440	1293640	He was bullshitting.
1293640	1294760	He was trying to get over on me.
1294760	1295720	So I said, you know what, bruh?
1296920	1297800	You know what?
1297800	1299960	I'm going to have my grandma making my own headbands
1300760	1302920	because everybody sell headbands in the stores.
1303640	1304600	All the stores sell headbands.
1304600	1307160	You ain't the first headband maker.
1307160	1308520	Who the fuck you think you are?
1308520	1309720	You the inventor of headbands?
1309720	1310600	You idiot.
1311320	1312440	So I made my own headbands.
1312440	1315240	He got mad because I posted it and I had a little following.
1315240	1315800	He got mad.
1315800	1317160	Was wearing my headbands with L.
1317160	1321400	He was like, this dude, he tried to take my idea.
1321400	1326280	He took the idea where you put the banner on your head and you cross it and you tie it
1326280	1327640	and you put it in your head.
1327640	1328760	He stole that from me.
1328760	1333720	Austin from the ACE family stole my art and I don't like him.
1334360	1335240	Don't like him, right?
1335800	1341880	So then a year later, just like Fred, the ACE family's blowing up.
1341880	1343640	I'm itching for that clout pill.
1343640	1344520	I need that clout.
1345080	1345960	ACE family blowing up.
1345960	1347640	They got over 10 million subs.
1347640	1349000	I'm trying to get some attention.
1350040	1353480	He comes out after we have made an ice cream truck from SD Wraps.
1354440	1357960	They literally customize this random as fuck.
1357960	1360040	They came up with it with their own brain.
1360760	1363480	They made the ice cream truck literally in a day, right?
1363480	1364760	We release it.
1365720	1369960	He tries to come out and say, we took his idea from getting an ice cream truck.
1371720	1374520	You know how many ice cream trucks are out there?
1374520	1377480	That's the real positivity we love to see.
1377480	1381240	And I'm making a slight observation here, but he's a bit of a dick.
1381240	1386040	Once again, I can't tell you if this is true because I haven't seen any real counter-revelance.
1386040	1389240	I'm open to alternative stories as the DMs were pretty vague,
1389240	1393240	but he's just so angry and petulant about it that you kind of want to hate him.
1393240	1398280	And this is one of the problems with the ACE family and most notably Austin's lack of empathy.
1398280	1401320	It was the same problem that made his response to the basketball
1401320	1404600	competition feel disconnected from what people were trying to say.
1404600	1408760	Now, it's clear this isn't a formal response, so I can't judge it too seriously,
1408760	1413000	but he just seems so angry at this guy because he sees anyone who criticizes like that as a
1413000	1416920	clout chaser, even though he was only provoked by one specific incident later,
1416920	1418040	which clearly bothered him.
1418040	1422440	It was clear Urban was upset at the time, and the DMs, even if they were vague,
1422440	1426680	showed a genuine pain, and Austin taps into that during that conversation,
1426680	1431400	saying in the messages that Urban's coming at him like a woman, a very classy man.
1431400	1436120	The contempt implies that he just can't acknowledge that he's ever made any missteps,
1436120	1438520	or why anyone would ever be upset at him.
1438520	1441800	And I think that rubs people the wrong way, it rubbed me the wrong way.
1441800	1446360	Disclaimer, the problem of a lack of empathy is going to be a running theme in this video.
1446360	1450440	When you see that side of Austin, it does bring into contention the notion and motives for the
1450440	1454840	way that he interacts with his audience, he always speaks about him wanting to give back,
1454840	1459240	but when people might come at him from an angle that implies they feel dissatisfied with his
1459240	1461800	behaviour, he just doesn't seem to clock it.
1461800	1466600	Selfless philanthropy in the way that the ACE family promotes is based on empathy for others,
1466600	1471160	and it adds a shade of scepticism when they seem to demonstrate a lack of it in other areas.
1471160	1475640	It doesn't necessarily prove an inability, but when you frame yourself in a way that anyone
1475640	1481240	criticising you is a bad faith actor, and true ACE family members know how much they really do,
1481240	1485960	it just gives me Greg Paul vibes, but whereas Greg Paul was overly defensive of destructive
1485960	1489880	behaviour from his children, McBroom seems to have a basic ego problem.
1489880	1493400	I don't want to doubt that the ACE family clearly do a fair bit for their audience,
1493400	1498200	it's clear given their interaction, and I respect that, but it's hard to deny that they have fallen
1498200	1503160	short at point, and when you fall short again, and again, and again, the criticism will begin
1503160	1508040	to accumulate, and as said, Austin isn't one for official statements, unless they're completely
1508040	1513000	unrelated to the actual criticism. What do I mean? Well, in spite of the fact that the ACE family
1513000	1517400	seldom demonstrates sympathy for their critics, they're more than ready to expect it themselves,
1517400	1521560	and often at opportune times, so I wanted to focus on this for the next part.
1522280	1526280	I've already talked about a couple of instances where they seem to undermine standards that many
1526280	1531080	would consider standard for that of a creator their size, but it does not end there. As a
1531080	1535560	successful creator, it's likely that you may want to engage your audience through other mediums,
1535560	1540200	this is something that the ACE family decide to pursue with the launch of their ACE family app.
1540200	1544600	Now looking at it in its current state, reviews are overwhelmingly positive, so hopefully any
1544600	1549320	problems there have been resolved, however at the time there were many people who had felt ripped
1549320	1553720	off due to the lack of content. There were a couple of reasons for this, at least as I
1553720	1558520	understand, and therefore the ACE family felt it was a good time to take a break.
1558520	1564600	This is actually happening, we will be taking a break from YouTube.
1564600	1570280	Not telling you guys how long, just yet, but we are taking a break. During our break,
1570280	1575640	which is why we said it wasn't really going to be a break, we'll be focusing on our app along with
1575640	1579160	our merch. For all the people who have the ACE family membership, we cannot thank you guys enough
1579720	1586360	for all the love and support you continue to show us. Just know we have a lot coming, we're not going to say too much, we just want to upload exclusive content and show you guys.
1586360	1591480	As many people interpreted this, it meant that they were going to be making content for the ACE family app, and therefore
1591480	1595720	creating a paywall between them and some of their less privileged viewers. As said, there were
1595720	1599800	complaints that they won't provide enough content on the app to justify the additional payment,
1599800	1604440	so basically it felt like they were kind of failing on both fronts. Generally, unless you're
1604440	1609080	really strapped for cash, it's good to make exclusive content as a bonus rather than taking
1609080	1614920	it away from your public content. However, a break is a break, and in their defence, it's hard to say
1614920	1620360	whether their comments were in reference to working on plans of their app or just the content itself.
1620360	1626120	I feel that this situation was likely a boiling over of other situations, but it's clear that the ACE
1626120	1631240	family at this point, after a run of controversies, probably had enough. This was all occurring in
1631240	1636760	January of 2019, one of their most controversial months, with reference to the 100k basketball
1636760	1642520	competition, and another incident involving the purchasing of a phallic lollipop for a child, which
1642520	1647560	we'll get to later. Now, many people were focusing on the app at this point, but when they announced
1647560	1652520	a break, I found it coincided very conveniently with the announcement of what is now known as the
1652520	1658040	ACE family documentary, Welcome to Our Life. Now, to defend them on this front, this was probably a
1658040	1663560	conceptual idea before the drama, but given their selected break that ends with their return, it's
1663560	1668760	very easy to think where their focus in the ensuing month may have been. I don't know how much they
1668760	1673400	worked on their merch or their app, but I think they had a bit of focus on this too. I like
1673400	1678200	documentaries on principle, hell, there's even a documentary out there on me, and it won't be the
1678200	1682840	last time that I try and make that sort of thing. From a filmmaking perspective, they can be really
1682840	1687320	great, but I think one of my biggest problems with documentaries, even those like the ones from Shane
1687320	1691960	Dawson, is that they can easily control the narrative and are often trying to make a statement
1691960	1696920	on the actual character of an individual, rather than any greater message, and therefore it can be
1696920	1702600	utilised, particularly by larger YouTubers, for propaganda reasons. It's very easy for an individual
1702600	1707880	to own a narrative when they own the camera, even when they say it's behind the scenes. Behind the
1707880	1712600	scenes documentaries were often gritty, and characters were sometimes unlikable because they
1712600	1717240	had a unique value in their performance that no one else could substitute, and therefore their
1717240	1722840	whole behaviour came with them. The modern day YouTube documentary can be very easily hijacked
1722840	1727080	by an individual to elicit sympathy from their audience, and that's the impression I received
1727080	1731720	when I heard about the Ace Family documentary. How do they follow through on it?
1731720	1738120	And what we do is so difficult, I feel like people don't understand that there's really
1739080	1742040	nothing private in our lives anymore.
1742040	1747080	I decided to take on the burden of watching these episodes of it in case they said anything of interest,
1747080	1752280	and the first episode was harmless enough, they talk about moving around and privacy issues, and although
1752280	1758920	I wouldn't exactly consider $1500 a month apartment a struggle, it was alright. I understand that as
1758920	1764120	public figures, they probably have a stressful life. My feelings were slightly mellowed by the end of the
1764120	1768120	first episode, however they went straight into it with the second.
1794120	1802920	I guess this is what many would consider an indirect response. It's completely coated with multiple other
1802920	1807320	narratives, and is what many YouTubers will do if they don't feel like they can give a direct
1807320	1812840	response to the criticism. They'll basically just create some straw man and say, wow, the haters do
1812840	1816200	suck. It reminds me of that Jake Paul rap, you know the one.
1816200	1828840	It sucks that media is often oriented towards the negative, but that's only because the negative actions
1828840	1833640	aren't what you'd expect from an individual. It's out of the ordinary, and therefore people are more
1833640	1838920	interested when a person indulges in it. That's not saying that you're a bad person, and mob mentality
1838920	1843240	can sometimes lead to the wrong impression, we're all aware of that now, but to act as if all the
1843240	1848280	backlash that you receive is representative to, for example, people being upset over tweets made
1848280	1852760	seven or eight years ago is extremely deceptive. Does it mean that those people don't exist?
1852760	1858440	Not at all, but they're certainly not representing the majority of what people are likely bothered by.
1858440	1862600	Basically, this whole scene felt like Austin wanted to create something vague enough to
1862600	1868760	invalidate and engrave it in the docuseries that throws in other, maybe very legitimate struggles,
1868760	1872680	in an attempt to elicit sympathy from an audience that probably hasn't thought about
1872680	1876360	the distinction between legitimate criticism and illegitimate criticism.
1876360	1883400	People go out of their way to make something seem so different of what it is.
1884760	1892440	Like, I literally just posted a snap of a Leia, like, me playing with her, her lay on her stomach,
1892440	1896840	having tummy time, and now I'm getting bashed for it. What do you mean? What are people, like, people saying
1896840	1902200	something? Like, yeah, they're saying I'm such a bad dad because I laid my newborn on her stomach,
1902200	1907560	when it's literally just tummy time, like, everyone knows about tummy time. I laid her on her stomach
1907560	1910760	to give her tummy time, I'm sitting there, like, making a cute snap with her,
1910760	1918040	and now people are bashing me for it. Like, this is why Catherine and I hesitate to film our kid.
1918040	1922600	He's representing the criticism that he receives by talking about this situation that I don't think
1922600	1927000	anyone with a brain is going to be thinking about. Then there's the implication spread to the point
1927000	1932040	that this is the sort of stuff being spoken about in the serious videos on him. He shows a reel of
1932040	1937560	those videos, which it really isn't. I get that people being overly critical, mob mentality,
1937560	1942120	they are all things that grind many of our gears, but to throw videos and to create this umbrella
1942120	1947240	is dishonest, and playing the sad music and implying sympathy with a title like the truth
1947240	1950840	about the Ace Family is about as heavy-handed as they come.
1951560	1957800	Like I've said before, we're human, and we've made some mistakes, I mean, like, we're not perfect,
1958600	1963880	but it doesn't mean that we're bad people, you know, and something coming out and circulating again
1964840	1968040	is literally purely just to make us look bad.
1968040	1971960	Here you are in a scene where they almost come to terms with their imperfections,
1971960	1976040	but then they flip it onto their head and say anyone releasing this stuff is just trying to
1976040	1980920	make us look bad, which given the criticism that I've discussed already is a fundamentally
1980920	1985480	redundant statement, given that some of these criticisms came from your own fans,
1985480	1990840	it's such an arrogant attitude that they try to masquerade in the oh woe is the struggle of the
1990840	1996200	Ace Family narrative. Listen, there are problems that come with fame, I can get why unnecessary
1996200	2000680	attention and criticism can bother you, but to speak generally and then provide an extreme
2000680	2005400	circumstance to try and explain why you're actually suffering is like Al Capone asking why
2005400	2010840	so many people were out to get him when all he did was evade taxes. Also, do you know how
2010840	2015000	to say the word frustrated? Because I'm feeling pretty flustrated right now.
2019320	2020040	Next part.
2020040	2036360	There's good criticism, and bad criticism. If you can't separate it, I don't really have much
2036360	2041080	respect for throwing an umbrella over it and arguing that they were the true victims. A lot of
2041080	2046680	the criticisms that they received could have been resolved fairly easily, only donating 75,000
2047320	2052680	donate an extra 25. Holding a basketball shootout where fans feel misled, do another one involving
2052680	2057000	your fans, or at least do something involving your fans as compensation. People feel like you've
2057000	2063000	screwed them over? Don't be a dick and go out and just talk a bunch of crap. It's not rocket science,
2063000	2066920	and I get you don't want to yield on every occasion, but there's a point where principle
2066920	2072120	pushes into stubbornness and you just end up looking unreasonable. And hell, when you actually
2072120	2076760	make a mistake and you receive criticism that you can't respond to, apologise, or at least
2076760	2081560	admit you got something wrong. The phallic lollipop is a prime example of something that
2081560	2087160	could have just been solved with a tweet saying it was inappropriate, my bad, but it wasn't.
2087160	2090840	The Ace Family are more than happy to admit they've made mistakes, but they'll never tell
2090840	2095800	you which specific ones because they don't want to actually admit to anything. I don't think it's
2095800	2100920	that demanding, and that's one of the things that I think just shows to me that McBroom has a
2100920	2105560	significant ego problem, that they just don't want to ever say they've done anything specific wrong,
2105560	2110760	and if you make any specific criticisms they will blow it up to a greatest character implication
2110760	2115960	and say, how dare you, we're not bad people. Not everyone's saying you're bad people. Some of these
2115960	2121240	critics are even your fans. It's very easy to see their whole documentary series as a beg for
2121240	2126040	sympathy towards conflicted fans who may be on the fence about their behaviour, and I personally
2126040	2130200	find it rather manipulative. The documentary was probably the most elaborate way to try and
2130200	2134680	retain fans, it was probably done in the light of the success these Shane Dawson videos had yielded
2134680	2139320	to, so it was a win-win. However, it's not the first time that people have accused them of baiting
2139320	2144280	for sympathy, no, there was an even more notorious incident in the year prior, not too long after they
2144280	2149560	had received a bitter stick for the 75k basketball situation. When something happens to you, it's
2149560	2154440	natural for you to receive people's sympathies, which is why sometimes people are a bit suspicious
2154440	2159000	about the motives of those who have terrible stuff happen to them not too long after they've
2159000	2164520	received some criticism. This was the case for the Ace Family, who had their house robbed in July of
2164520	2169960	2018, amongst a fairly decent wave of criticism. On one hand, this was met with a lot of sympathy,
2169960	2175000	and people understood why the Ace Family were distraught over this. However, very quickly,
2175000	2179080	suspicion began to boil up around the circumstances surrounding this incident.
2179080	2184920	Did the Ace Family arrange or stage their own break-in? However, ladies and gentlemen,
2185480	2190840	this is a crime scene, and we need someone on the case, so I have assigned Detective Jonathan
2190840	2196280	Jawbury to deal with this matter, and to see if we can work out what can be said about the situation.
2196840	2200600	I suggest we pass it over to him to present it and his subsequent findings.
2202520	2207640	Parents often play a critical part in forming their child's first relationships,
2207640	2212680	acting as a role model and exemplifying the types of behaviors they wish to see exhibited
2212680	2217480	by their own one day. As such, children will always turn out best when their parents are
2217480	2221640	there to nurture, love, and support them throughout their personal experiences,
2221640	2225320	which is why we need more parents shoving cameras down their kids' throats for the
2225320	2230120	sole purpose of internet clout. That was a joke. We don't need that at all, actually.
2230120	2235320	But regardless, family vlogs have always been an integral aspect of YouTube as we know it.
2235320	2239560	From the Shaytards all the way down to the Inghams, families will continue to play a
2239560	2244120	significant role in the online zeitgeist. And although it isn't necessarily for me,
2244120	2248760	I understand the appeal. People, children especially, crave the types of connections
2248760	2253240	that can be easily accessed through internet personalities. When you watch Cole and Seth,
2253240	2257480	for example, you aren't just another audience member, you're a part of their lives,
2257480	2263400	adding to the immense power these figures often wield. Kids and families trust that these types
2263400	2269000	of creators are being open and honest with them, giving them an elevated responsibility. Which is
2269000	2273480	why many believe these channels deserve to be held accountable for their actions,
2273480	2277800	hence why the Ace Family has been subject of such intense scrutiny.
2284040	2289560	On August 16th, 2018, the Ace Family made waves in the community by uploading their famed
2289560	2294280	Someone Broke Into Our House vlog, where the title pretty much tells you all you need to know.
2319560	2332520	Their vlog documents the aftermath of a supposed home invasion that took place while the three
2332520	2337800	were spending some quality time together at Disneyland. The half hour long video depicts
2337800	2343480	police cars, smashed belongings, ransacked closets, and of course Austin and Catherine
2343480	2347160	trying their absolute best to save face in the wake of a crisis.
2349560	2366760	They both make a clear effort to drive home the fact that, oh,
2366760	2372760	things can be replaced, but people, people can't. Which is nice, you know, I mean I don't think
2372760	2378200	you'll find many who disagree with that sentiment, but to me they just seem a little too calm and
2378200	2383800	collected to have just found out their 10 million dollar home was burglarized. Which was just the
2383800	2403560	beginning of the suspicions more and more people would start to air. It's true that robberies can
2403560	2409080	happen to anyone, anywhere, at any given time, but to ignore the glaring circumstances surrounding
2409080	2414280	the family at the time of their break-in would be counterproductive. As James was quick to mention
2414280	2419560	earlier, people do crazy things for sympathy, especially those who make their living by
2419560	2424440	earning clicks online. Lord knows Austin and Catherine are no strangers to clickbait. Hell,
2424440	2428760	even if the robbery did happen, they still went out of their way to stage a whole ass thumbnail
2428760	2434680	to get that sweet, sweet CTR. It strikes me as a bit odd that just a few weeks prior to this
2434680	2440040	incident, the whole basketball controversy went down in which people accused the family of stealing
2440040	2445880	money from a charity event. So would it be within reason for someone in their position to stage a
2445880	2451400	fake tragedy for the simple aim of gaining pity? Yes. But does that mean, without a shadow of a
2451400	2457240	doubt, that the robbery was faked? No, not necessarily. Which is why we need to look at
2457240	2462120	the details of the proceeding before we do anything else. At first, people were already
2462120	2466600	suspicious of the way the police behaved on camera. Some viewers even going so far as to
2466600	2486520	insist that they weren't even a part of the LAPD. A theory that was later reinforced when a fan dug
2486520	2492920	up evidence of a place called Top Cop Shop in LA renting out fake police and squad cars on August
2492920	2498760	16th, the same night the robbery reportedly took place. Catherine was quick to dismiss this smear
2498760	2503640	campaign against her family on Twitter, though you can't really blame people for asking the question,
2503640	2509560	can you? Renting re-enactors is not particularly uncommon in reality TV, leading many to wonder if
2509560	2514760	they had just recreated the incident in an attempt to make their situation appear more dramatic for
2514760	2519560	YouTube. Perhaps the family had suffered an actual home invasion a day prior and,
2519560	2524840	being unsatisfied with the initial footage, rented out fake cops to hype it up for the cameras.
2524840	2529400	After all, it couldn't have been completely fabricated. The real police report was posted
2529400	2534120	by Keemstar on Twitter. Austin later appeared in an Instagram Live following the incident,
2534120	2539400	showing unedited footage of someone checking for fingerprints the next morning, although it's
2539400	2544600	pretty standard protocol to check for those kinds of things immediately after the incident takes
2545000	2549800	as to not disrupt the crime scene. So, you know, that's a little sus. He also announced that the
2549800	2554440	family would be moving to a new house since they no longer felt safe in their current home,
2554440	2559640	leading some to assume that they simply trashed the house and left it, though that's a bit of a
2559640	2564600	stretch considering it took almost an entire year for the move to officially happen, but even then
2564600	2570200	it's not completely off the table, and we never saw any footage of the actual robbery. A 10 million
2570280	2575960	dollar house is sure to come with cameras and alarm system at the very least, but despite their
2575960	2581160	abundant coverage of the situation, they never so much as mentioned any of that. It just comes off
2581160	2586040	so orchestrated to me, I don't know. Here we are being so honest with you guys, like you guys
2586040	2592440	say the craziest rumors about us, like the craziest things. Someone is making a fake receipt
2592440	2599240	of like us paying for cop actors, like these were real cops that were in her home. Like that's
2599240	2603640	against the law to do that, to fake a receipt, to fake an invoice, that's against the law.
2603640	2608600	That's crazy. That's slander. We have to leave our house, like we can't be here anymore,
2608600	2614360	as much as I'd love to continue living in my home, we have to leave because it's not safe.
2614360	2618520	Looking at the evidence, I believe something must have happened to them, but even that still leaves
2618520	2623640	room for more unanswered questions. Things like why didn't these robbers take the diamond play
2623640	2629160	button, and why was Austin filming the entire time as if to prove he wasn't hiding anything.
2629160	2633240	Someone in their position probably wouldn't have behaved as orderly, given the tremendous
2633240	2638280	shock and grief that must come along with getting your mansion ransacked while you're conveniently
2638280	2643160	out at Disneyland. The Ace family is in such a position to where they can literally lie about
2643160	2647000	anything to their audience, and they're not really going to be pressed for the real truth.
2647000	2652360	The dishonesty of this family runs deep, and whether this was staged or not, people have
2652360	2657880	every reason to question the parts of their life they publicized. The fact that this all came only
2657880	2663240	two weeks after some of Austin's old problematic tweets resurfaced, coupled with their apparent
2663240	2668280	inability to simply own up to their own mistakes, is enough to make anyone suspicious. But would
2668280	2674440	this family really go through all the trouble of hiring fake cops to drum up a sensationalist story
2674440	2679480	for the sole purpose of seeking reconciliation among their fanbase? That's something I'll let
2679480	2681960	you decide for yourself.
2681960	2687880	That was some intense detective work, but I'm proud to have YouTube's finest on the case, which I'm aware
2687880	2693160	is the equivalent of kindergarten cop, but I think Jon would make an excellent Arnold Schwarzenegger,
2693160	2698120	if Arnold Schwarzenegger was a tiny twink of course, but we love him all the same. I think probably
2698120	2702760	the most frustrating part of the whole ordeal was once again their reaction to the idea that people
2702760	2707640	may be doubting this. It's the same routine that we've seen time and time again, and you think they'd
2707640	2713320	just be a bit more understanding of what's come their way, but they just don't have a clue how to
2713320	2719000	fully get people to understand their perspective. Austin and Catherine have never been afraid to
2719000	2723000	present an image of themselves to the audience, but they're also masters in orchestrating the
2723000	2727960	representation of their lives, so house intrusions, whether legitimate or not, is obviously going to be
2727960	2732760	seen by many as part of the melodrama, and many others as a distraction to how they actually act
2732760	2737320	behind the scenes. However, even if they fake their intention for the good deeds, they're good
2737320	2742840	deeds, and if they provide the right message for aspiring creators and parents, then that can't be
2742840	2750280	a bad thing, right? But are they really truly virtuous, are they really who we should be looking up to?
2750280	2752120	I'm just not entirely sure they are.
2756920	2760680	Now as mentioned at the start, the move away from wholesome role models towards characters
2760680	2765640	that inspire more cynicism is something that is impossible to avoid. The Ace family is no real
2765640	2770520	exception to that rule, and I understand that, but I would also posit that in spite of this, family
2770520	2775720	channels should be held to a marginally higher standard than those of Jake Paul, because although
2775720	2780520	they are more than worthy of their criticism, like a lot of it, Jake Paul is at least the
2780520	2785480	representation of a dumb privileged frat boy who just moved in with his friends. His antics
2785480	2790200	represent a fleeting part of young adulthood that will eventually capitulate itself. He has the
2790280	2795560	inspirational garbage, but it's so unbelievably inept that no one really buys it. With the Ace
2795560	2801000	family, what they're doing is presenting this family life, which as mentioned, a cultural staple
2801000	2805960	to many, a necessary stage of growth, and a part of everyone's life, whether positive or negative.
2805960	2811240	On the one hand, I would hope that the Ace family realises their behaviour has an effect on probably
2811240	2816280	the workings of many other families. On the other hand, it makes what we're about to talk about worse.
2816280	2820280	I think this is what particularly vexed people are in the next couple of situations that we're
2820280	2825160	going to be discussing. Let's talk about the lollipop. This situation once again occurred
2825160	2830440	in January of 2019, as mentioned. Austin was taking a child out shopping, they go into what
2830440	2835960	I assume is a novelty shop, or a more adult oriented shop, and then shock horror, on his
2835960	2840120	Snapchat story, this is posted. He finds himself in some hijinks.
2849320	2853400	Oh no, I can't believe she wanted the penis shaped lollipop,
2853400	2856440	what madness. How on earth did that happen?
2866600	2872200	Keep that in the bag forever, do not show that to anybody, okay? That's your little secret.
2872200	2879160	Guys, I'm in so much trouble, but she said she's gonna steal it if I didn't buy it, so better me buy it.
2879160	2884680	Oh damn it, Austin, he had to buy it for her, or else she was gonna steal it, damn.
2884680	2890120	McBroom really got put in a tough situation here, I'm sure that everyone bought that very sincere
2890120	2896520	explanation, they didn't, and there was immediate criticism for Austin, because he bought a penis
2896520	2901640	shaped lollipop for a child, and then gave it to them. It was extremely inappropriate, and not the
2901640	2906520	sort of thing that you would hope a family YouTuber to be doing. It's hard for me to be particularly
2906520	2912360	angry, I was much angrier when Jake Paul just shouted at babies, so maybe I'm just desensitised
2912360	2917240	to penis, but I do agree with the criticism. No doubt Austin clearly wanted a funny story,
2917240	2922760	but knew he'd get stuck, so tried to pin the responsibility on the child. I think it illuminates
2922760	2928280	one of the biggest problems with children in family vlogs. In their little documentary series, they say this.
2928280	2934600	Like if Elle didn't like being in front of the camera, she was like, like if she was running away, and she wasn't
2934600	2940920	like, you know, interacting, we would not be they family. No, we wouldn't, 100%. It would never be the same effect.
2940920	2946280	And I just find it as a comment, rather redundant. Children that young can't exactly say whether they
2946280	2951560	want to be on camera, even if they appear to enjoy it. Austin and Catherine constantly talk about how
2951560	2955960	their life has changed due to the attention in the series, but hardly take a look at how it's going to
2955960	2960200	affect a child at one of their most vulnerable times in their life. And when you're someone like
2960200	2965320	Austin who clearly finds some value in the drama, you know, not being criticised for it could have
2965320	2970440	genuine ramifications on your children. It's not like I'm against having children in family vlogs,
2970440	2975080	but I don't think they should be a part of the drama that Austin tends to involve himself in.
2975080	2979880	I don't think it happens on a rather excessive basis, but I think it's something worth noting,
2979880	2984600	especially when looking at these dramas. This isn't exclusive, but it's a cumulative criticism they
2984600	2989400	shouldn't ignore. Hell, one of their newest videos was originally titled as the children ranking
2989400	2995160	seductive Halloween costumes, and you can see why it bothers people. Infants aren't props, and their
2995160	3000680	innocence and wellbeing should be prioritised over the acquisition of views. The fact that they never
3000680	3005480	really talk about these things just makes them poor role models, really, and I'll explain why now.
3005480	3010840	Take this recent issue where Austin acquired a jet ski, and decided to ride it around his mansion's
3010840	3015640	pool. According to many in the area, the amount of water discharged caused mudslides that created
3015640	3020200	additional problems in the neighbourhood, including negatively affecting property and a great
3020200	3025720	plantation, a complaint to have been made to the city but the antics continued. Now as far as I can
3025720	3030840	see, there's not really much to imply this isn't the Ace family, it adds up. So eventually this was
3030840	3035080	resolved in private, and Catherine did actually talk about it in their video, and removed the jet
3035080	3038440	ski from the accommodation, in which she made this statement.
3038440	3043320	Austin wanted to get into this jet ski, and there was nothing that I could do about it because,
3043320	3049400	you know, Austin is Austin. At the end of the day, you know, sometimes I kind of have to be a team
3049400	3054120	player, and accept some of the things that he's gonna do. To be honest with you guys, Austin has
3054120	3059400	been doing crazy things for the past couple of years, you guys know that. You guys should see the
3059400	3064680	things that didn't make it onto our channel because of me, so I'm like content patrol.
3064680	3069800	After the first time that he used it, we actually got a complaint we were actually unaware of.
3069800	3073800	The complaint went straight to our builder because the neighbour's actually friends with the builder,
3073800	3078280	and so he's like, hey man, like there's water coming down on my property. Like originally when
3078280	3082680	Austin rode the jet ski, I was under the impression, even Austin was under the impression, like no one
3082680	3087240	thought that the water would like reach anywhere else. Even though yes, water reaches in other
3087240	3091560	places, but because we have an infinity pool, we thought that the water was going down on like the
3091560	3096040	bottom, or like the drainage part. Since we have like all this land that goes all the way down,
3096040	3100360	we thought, oh it's just water, like you know, it's not gonna go anywhere. There's not that much water.
3100360	3105160	So he hit our builder up, and he was like, hey like there's some water going here. So our builder
3105160	3111640	actually took it upon himself, and built a whole entire retaining wall down below on our property.
3111640	3114920	So he built that wall, and he actually didn't even tell us because it was my birthday. We were
3114920	3119160	on vacation, so he said he didn't want to bother us with it. So yeah, when we came back and used
3119160	3125800	the jet ski the third time, we got a complaint, and even though there was a retaining wall there,
3125800	3130280	someone wanted to complain and say something anyways. Which I understand, like it's still
3130280	3134600	the matter of the fact, but it's still my property that the water is going down on. But to be honest
3134600	3141000	with you, if that were me, I would be so upset. Like if someone was putting anything on my property,
3141000	3145480	like it doesn't even matter if it's water. So you don't want anything on your property. If I had a
3145480	3151640	garden, or you know, like a garden of grapes, or like trees and stuff, like I wouldn't want anything
3151640	3155880	on my property. So I completely understand, like if anyone were to be upset. But again, you know,
3155880	3160760	there is that retaining wall that's there. But either way, I want the jet ski out.
3160760	3165080	It kind of sucks that she didn't actually apologize. Sorry really does seem to be the
3165080	3169480	hardest word for this family, but it could be worse. She does at least empathize with the people
3169480	3174360	making the complaints. Then there's this recorded confrontation with Austin, which honestly
3174360	3178600	feels kind of forced, but you know, at least they took action. Though I guess it would have been
3178600	3183160	nice to see more of a personal acknowledgement from Austin, given that it was his antics on the
3183160	3195480	jet ski that caused this trouble. Austin, how the hell did you get out of the pool? That jet ski is
3195480	3200040	so heavy. How do you think it got in the pool? Me, and like four of my friends.
3204920	3212040	You did not have people carried out of the pool. I did. To where? Where is it? Commenters stated
3212040	3217080	how they felt Austin came across as rather rude and inconsiderate. As said, I hope it's fake,
3217080	3221240	but it also seems dark that once again, he purposely missed out on the opportunity to be
3221240	3226200	a bit more mature and take some responsibility. Maybe I'd be a bit annoyed too if I thought my
3226200	3230840	partner had sold one of my items, but equally he was behaving so recklessly on it, and there was
3230840	3236200	no use for it either. It's hard to really blame anyone but yourself. For the record, Catherine
3236200	3240840	didn't actually sell it, she just put it in the garage. Although this issue is resolved, you don't
3240840	3245400	really receive the impression that Austin has grown from the situation, and I think the idea of
3245400	3250440	personal growth is important to the issue at hand, especially with a young or sensitive audience.
3250440	3255240	Now fortunately, Catherine's framing kind of shows Austin in the situation for the juvenile
3255240	3260040	individual that he is, but he's often the one at the helm, and he's the one with control over the
3260040	3265640	narrative, which as we've shown, isn't always the best decision. Austin comes across as a bit
3265640	3271560	immature, and the jet ski situation shows him as a big kid who loves his toys a little too much.
3271560	3276200	He often seems to lack thought about how his actions affect others, and that's not a good
3276200	3280600	thing for a creator his size. I think it'd be good for him to sometimes take a step back and
3280600	3285400	look at the implications beyond his immediate family. With an impressionable audience,
3285400	3287320	you're missing out on that opportunity.
3290920	3296120	The public eye is a cruel mistress. It's true, it kinda sucks we focus on the negative rather
3296120	3300920	than the positive, but by focusing on themselves as victims of the haters, they are doing exactly
3300920	3306040	the same. The Ace Family still have millions of loyal subscribers who like and watch every
3306040	3311720	single video they put out. Even at the peak of all the drama, they have completely persisted
3311720	3317560	as creators in the spotlight with overwhelmingly positive like to dislike ratios, which I know
3317560	3322840	doesn't mean everything, but they say enough about the strength of the Ace Family members.
3322840	3327160	Does that mean that as public figures they don't have problems? No, not at all. In fact,
3327160	3331000	the public eye can give you a lot of problems, but it doesn't mean those problems are sourced
3331000	3335240	in criticisms that have yielded from public behaviour which to many people is fair enough
3335240	3340440	to criticise. I think the Ace Family understand that, to be honest, because they do acknowledge
3340440	3345560	it, but they try to link it back to public criticism in an attempt to deflect it. Deep down,
3345560	3349880	the real problems with the public eye are, as always, how it can affect the personal,
3349880	3354920	private lives of individuals, which has always been a problem for anyone with celebrity status,
3354920	3359240	especially rumours of what's personally going on behind the scenes, and how the gossip can
3359240	3363880	spread. This is something the Ace Family has been subjected to as well, and once again,
3363880	3368520	that's the problem with family vlogs. I genuinely believe that vlogging your life in the way that
3368520	3373640	the Ace Family does put your family at risk. We spoke about Austin's relationship with Catherine,
3373640	3377960	but for the Family, it's a huge selling point. On Twitter, they only follow each other,
3377960	3382840	and they publicly indulge in a lot of romantic behaviour and market it to their audience.
3382840	3387080	However, in spite of this, many have become suspicious that it's a bit of an act,
3387080	3392520	many relating to other reported behaviours from family members, mostly Austin. One of the prominent
3392520	3397640	personal narratives is the one regarding Austin McBrun's faithfulness to his wife Catherine.
3397640	3401960	There are a lot of individuals who have claimed that Austin's antics extend to other women,
3401960	3406600	thus yielding to a narrative regarding infidelity that a lot of people believe. There have been a few
3406600	3410680	videos and posts that have accused him of this. One that received a significant amount of coverage
3410680	3415800	was a post by Belluck Gurr, who in posting an Instagram message she sent to Catherine on
3415800	3420200	Twitter, stated that while Austin was in Miami for the weekend, he slept with one of her friends,
3420200	3424840	and then made her sign an NDA. The author of this message said they couldn't stand quietly and let
3424840	3430120	this happen, and wanted to let her know as a mother and a woman. She also posted an additional reply
3430120	3434840	saying that she had all the proof and screenshots, and would only talk to Catherine. Catherine did
3434840	3439400	see this, and she snapped back, saying that if there was evidence she wanted to see it,
3439400	3444280	and if they were at risk of being sued due to an NDA, then she would pay for it out of her own
3444280	3449960	pockets. There were no further public interactions in this exchange. And honestly, it's hard to really
3449960	3455080	prove anything either way. There are a lot of claims about Austin's infidelity. Some had
3455080	3459320	suggested that the person sending this message couldn't have been watching since Elle was still
3459320	3464520	in the belly as their first video was the Q&A after Elle was born. However, as we know, looking
3464600	3469640	at the social blade, it seemed there may have been videos before the first upload, so unfortunately
3469640	3474200	that was a bit of a dead end. There were some additional conversations, and possible proof,
3474200	3479240	but honestly it was not concrete at all, it was pretty flimsy, and therefore the situation just
3479240	3483320	tailed off. Don't get me wrong, there are a significant amount of people who believe they've
3483320	3488280	seen Austin cheating, you can't ignore that, but this is the sort of thing that would undeniably
3488280	3493080	put stress on individuals within families, and a lot of it comes from the simultaneous popularity
3493080	3497240	and unpopularity of Austin. There are various videos out there that quote,
3497240	3503160	prove that he's cheating, and once again, it's really hard to ascertain what the truth is.
3503160	3509560	All right, so it's really hard to make out, but this is Austin right here, so we'll just try to
3509560	3517640	like slow it down somehow. So I think it's this girl right here, if you look really carefully.
3523080	3530920	Alrighty, honestly it's hard to ignore the general case of cheating, given the amount of claims,
3530920	3536120	but the number of people reaching to try and get a slice of the pie is just nauseating to follow.
3536120	3540760	This eventually boiled over with probably the strongest allegations of them all,
3540760	3545720	alluding to sexual assault. Published by YouTube by the name of Cole Carrigan, he uploaded a video
3545720	3550360	called The Truth About The Ace Family, which is a 15 minute video detailing and promoting these
3550360	3551960	allegations against him.
3551960	3557640	So I know a lot of you guys are probably thinking, what does Cole Carrigan have to do with the Ace Family?
3557640	3562280	Why is he inserting himself in something that has nothing to do with him? He should just become a
3562280	3567960	drama channel at this point. Whenever it involves people that I love, I don't care who you are,
3567960	3573080	I will speak what I want to speak, and if I have facts to speak, it will be said.
3573080	3577080	In the video, he states how he came to the conclusion that he needs to come forward regarding this.
3577080	3581400	He states that people have been threatened with lawsuits, and that he's not afraid to talk about it
3581400	3586200	because he hasn't signed an NDA. He talks about how Keemstar had reached out to him and called him,
3586200	3590920	before subsequently turning down the story because he took a 500k bribe from the Ace Family.
3590920	3595400	We kind of just stayed low because we saw a bunch of tweets about people already knowing that he was
3595400	3600760	uploading a video the next day about the situation, so we kind of were just like not worried, and we
3600760	3606440	were just gonna kind of let it unfold that way so we didn't have to insert ourselves where it wasn't
3606440	3612040	needed. The next day came and he didn't tweet anything, he didn't upload anything, so I texted
3612040	3618200	him saying how much did they pay you to keep quiet, and he responded with this, and I was
3618200	3623400	completely shocked. I immediately called my friend and told her that he was paid off $500,000 to keep
3623400	3628920	quiet about the situation, and that I needed to come forward. He then spoke about the situation,
3628920	3633880	he notes that there are NDAs involved, but that would be nullified in instances of rape, and that
3633880	3639240	this situation is now more important than that. So obviously my tweet got a lot of attention,
3639240	3644760	and someone from Austin Mcbruden's team actually texted my friend that this happened to,
3644760	3650680	I'll put the screenshot right here, basically saying that we should be careful and shouldn't
3650680	3658760	go any farther than what we're already doing to avoid legal action, and I proceeded to tell her
3658760	3663400	they're just trying to scare you, I just went through these exact same things, so I'm not scared.
3663400	3668120	I also didn't sign an NDA, and I also don't tolerate the shit that has happened to my friend.
3668120	3673320	So with that being said, I told her to ignore that message, because what needs to be said is going to
3673320	3678280	be said regardless, and if I need to say it, I'll do it, because I didn't sign an NDA, come arrest me.
3678280	3683560	So the story is that basically Austin approved a set of girls to come down and see him. They convened
3683560	3689000	in Miami around the 21st of July for an event, Austin went with his dad, Cole then provides
3689000	3693800	corroborating screenshots to show circumstantial evidence for the environment that preceded this
3693800	3700440	event, and then he goes into the details of the sexual assault. Disclaimer, this following clip will not be pleasant.
3700440	3706760	After they all had been drinking, my two friends went back to their room to go change because the sun was setting,
3706760	3714920	and that's when Austin, the security guard, the father, and two other guys came into their room.
3714920	3719640	Obviously, I don't have recordings that went down in the room, but my friend told me that
3719640	3727720	she repeatedly said no multiple times, over and over and over, to the point where she started crying,
3727720	3734280	begging them to stop. That's when they forced themselves in her, and I will insert the photos
3734280	3741960	of the blood all over the bedsheets in the hotel room right here on the exact same date, June 22nd.
3741960	3747560	There are many more details, but I'd recommend watching the video if you're interested, it's strong stuff for sure.
3747560	3752520	He continues to show evidence of a conversation that followed, the felt provided more substantiation
3752520	3757400	to the environment that played into this, before having this friend who is the victim come on the phone
3757400	3762280	for an anonymous testimony. This testimony doesn't provide too much more, bar the detail.
3762280	3767880	If you want that, then I'd recommend you go listen. Ultimately, Cole concludes that this is enough evidence
3767880	3772760	to prove, beyond doubt, that Austin McBroom is not just a cheat, but a rapist, and someone who does not
3772760	3775160	deserve to be in such a position of power.
3775160	3780920	Okay, so now that you literally have the point of view from somebody who was actually there,
3780920	3788040	that is enough proof, and I really don't need to provide anything else for you to see that Austin, his dad,
3788040	3797000	his whole security team are pieces of shit, and these are not people that should be given all this
3797000	3804840	crazy amount of success. I can't live with knowing that this type of person who's doing these things to people
3804840	3812440	is just like, winning at life, literally having everything just handed to them, money, fame, dah dah dah dah.
3812440	3818040	This was a huge problem for the Ace Family, with the public eye on them, it felt like everything was on the edge
3818040	3824680	of imploding, but what was going on behind the scenes wasn't quite as cut and dry as it seemed.
3827000	3843000	I hate knowing that something this serious could put an end to the Ace Family, or such a loved group of people,
3843000	3848040	like I don't want to be that person, that's not what I'm here to do, I don't want to split up a family,
3848040	3854200	I don't want to end relationships, because I've been getting a lot of messages like that,
3854200	3859560	oh why don't you stay quiet, why are you trying to ruin or end this family, it's not about that,
3859560	3864360	like that's the last thing I want to do is rip someone's family apart or anything, but whenever
3865000	3872120	something this serious happens and it's to my friend and multiple other people are coming forward about
3872120	3878040	other experiences, it's just not something that I as a person can stay quiet on, it's just against my
3878040	3883720	morals and it's something I absolutely won't do, so that's why I am here making this video for them.
3883720	3889880	Wow, how honourable Cole. The video in question is hard hitting and powerful, and for a while the momentum
3889880	3894920	seemed solidly in Cole's favour, however the ties began to turn when additional details came out,
3894920	3899560	particularly regarding the claims he had made about Keemstar. Obviously, as we know in his video,
3899560	3904840	Cole claimed Keemstar was paid $500,000 not to cover the drama, but this was refuted pretty quickly
3904840	3909160	by Keemstar himself as he posted screenshots which showed he had followed up on his message by
3909160	3913880	clarifying he was being sarcastic. On top of this, logically speaking, there was no way that Keemstar
3913880	3918840	would have admitted something like that seriously and just casually in a DM like that, as it would
3918840	3924120	threaten his brand, given how much money it is likely Keemstar has already, I'm not sure $500k
3924120	3929400	would make a huge difference, and therefore this alternative story about sarcasm makes much more sense.
3929400	3934360	Cole's Dad- Frankly, you've been very adamant on Twitter that you are going to ruin the Ace family,
3934360	3938680	so if they did pay me off $500k, why would I tell you?
3938680	3943000	It doesn't reflect well on Cole, because it's a simple fact. If he's prepared to lie about this,
3943000	3946760	then what else was he prepared to lie about? It means later the other girl who was referenced in
3946760	3950920	the video comes forward with her own testimony. She doesn't say too much, but she says she felt
3950920	3954600	the video was not released for the right reasons, and that Cole had approached her under the
3954600	3959240	precipice that he thought they could make a lot of money off this. These DMs brought forward by
3959240	3964920	this other victim showed Cole not actually being concerned for the justice of victims, but showing
3964920	3971000	more concern in how much money it could make them. So I'm sure they would want to pay me $100k or more,
3971000	3976840	not to say shit, and then I could split that with you guys if you help me and send me all the receipts
3976840	3981000	that I need. With this additional information, McVroom jumped in, showing these DMs, and also
3981000	3985400	stating that he would be pursuing legal action. Although Cole has stated that he does not feel
3985400	3989080	that they are following through on that threat, he has also admitted that his intentions were not
3989080	3994040	pure at the start, but now he realises that the fight for justice must persist, and has found a
3994040	3999560	new reason, and I just hate this all. There were some additional tweets and allegations that were
3999560	4004680	just terrible, this set of screenshots were proven completely fake, really depressing. Catherine
4004680	4009560	responded too, but it was with this weird DM which I wasn't even sure was in the video, and I'm not
4009560	4014040	sure how it tied into the allegations, so I was confused about that. Oh, and one more thing, this
4014040	4018200	garbage tweet which implied that because he had made multiple statements about involving his lawyers,
4018200	4023560	it applied some kind of guilt. I don't think that's how it works, I think Austin has an ego,
4023560	4028520	I think he wants to make people who he feels accused him wrongly suffer, and I think that will
4028520	4033000	follow through. I think if this does go to court, you'll understand why he acquired lawyers. As a
4033000	4037160	quick side note, I thought it was really terrible also how people claimed the one of the girls was
4037160	4042600	paid off because she said Austin McVroom was not at fault. You know the sort of believe victims
4042600	4047320	parenthesis when they agree with me narrative that I find absolutely vulgar. Most of the people
4047320	4051960	involved in this situation are fundamentally unlikable, and I don't think many of the audiences
4051960	4058200	are equipped to handle this either. Trial by Tarot cards is a new one, I admit. I'd also like to add
4058200	4063160	that the girl has since deleted these statements from her Instagram but stands by them, understandably
4063160	4068040	she didn't want it to be a persistent aspect of her life. It's hard to say exactly what happened,
4068040	4073160	but I'm not going to dismiss experiences as people being paid off. It has become a bit of an
4073160	4078120	obsessive narrative, even on Keemstar's video where he shows the context to the DM, there are
4078120	4083880	people claiming he was paid off too. One person even said, watch Cole Carrigan's video as proof
4083880	4089160	despite that video. It's a mess, and people are projecting preconceived opinions to dictate their
4089160	4093400	position on something much more complicated. It's not impossible that someone's been paid
4093400	4098360	off somewhere, but on the other hand, being able to expose someone as paying you off could be just
4098360	4103480	as profitable in the online age, so people would be very cautious in offering individuals payments
4103480	4108920	themselves. In spite of all this, I just feel bad for the daughters involved. But what about the
4108920	4113560	children cliche, I'm aware, but these are the controversies that are gonna make people's lives
4113560	4118280	a misery because people are taking a family life and turning it into a game of clout, and those
4118280	4123320	children didn't consent to that. This new drama is the point where it becomes destructive, I don't
4123320	4127720	know fully whose fault that is, but the fact that Cole can sit there and say he doesn't want to tear
4127720	4132440	a family apart but then make that video, extremely disingenuous. Austin has clearly been up to
4132440	4137480	something too, the extent of it I'm not sure, but he needs to be more cautious. He's a huge creator
4137480	4142520	now, congratulations, you live a lavish life, but you still have a family. This is the sort of stuff
4142520	4147000	that will harm a relationship even if your partner believes you, and the worrying thought is that
4147000	4151560	doubt that people are just staying together for the sake of the YouTube channel, that's not healthy
4151560	4155560	either. Families are meant to be natural, they're meant to exist because you want them to exist.
4155560	4160440	If you can film that family life and make a quick buck then I'm not one to stand in your way,
4160440	4165400	but the prime aim of a family is to surround yourself with people you love and provide a healthy
4165400	4169880	environment to children who are going to be the next generation, and you want to provide them with
4169880	4174840	the principles that they stand by. Austin and Catherine obviously didn't ask for these allegations,
4174840	4179160	but people's negative judgement towards the Ace Family has been a result of a consistent failure
4179160	4183800	to empathise with other people, and so when the Ace Family needed empathy of their own, they didn't
4183800	4188600	get it. My empathy is free, I think it's shit that if false these allegations have surfaced in such
4188600	4194520	a way, pushed by an agenda hungry toxic individual who should be nowhere near dealing with cases,
4194520	4199240	as sensitive as this, but look at the controversies we've spoken about today, and ask yourself how can
4199240	4204440	you make audiences see your perspective more clearly. The Ace Family kinda suck, they seem fake,
4204440	4208040	they often seem entitled to think they're above criticism because of the good deeds they've done
4208040	4212280	which trivialises those good deeds, they lack empathy for others and yet try to manipulate it
4212280	4216760	out of their audiences through incidents or truth style documentaries, and generally they,
4216760	4221640	mostly Austin, seem to be ill-equipped to be role models to viewers, both adults and children.
4221640	4225400	This has built up a lot of contempt in critics because they've acquired this position of power
4225400	4229480	while not being particularly responsible, and so when these more serious allegations surfaced,
4229480	4234040	paired with the assumption that many people have that Austin is a cheat, people immediately wanted
4234040	4238600	to see the back of them, people wanted to take them down. I personally treat these allegations
4238600	4243800	with caution, given that it already seems muddy and the mix of vested interests
4243800	4249480	really doesn't reassure me. If it's real, then once again, terribly handled, and it should've been
4249480	4254360	kept out of someone like Cole's hands, I think most of the hatred towards them is an outcome of
4254360	4258920	them just constantly pissing off people, and although it is people's responsibility to not
4258920	4263320	be as presumptuous, it's incredible once again how quickly people have jumped to a conclusion,
4263320	4268120	I feel like it's a risk when you constantly shun people who criticise you, you're going to create
4268120	4274120	tension which in this instance, snapped. Let us move on to our conclusion from this lengthy saga.
4282120	4286600	The Ace Family seem to involve themselves in much more drama than a lot of YouTube families,
4286600	4291000	and they go this midway between responding to criticism and just straight up deflecting it or
4291000	4295160	victimising themselves, and they never seem to work out the simplest way to respond, either
4295160	4300200	because of ignorance or ego, probably both to a certain extent. Austin seems to be the worst
4300200	4305240	offender, he seems rather juvenile and reckless, he's basically Roman Atwood trying to be Jake
4305240	4309480	Paul, and Jake Paul shouldn't be a dad, he's already exploiting enough children as it is.
4309480	4314040	Catherine, although being somewhat more reserved, seems to at least be complicit in a lot of these
4314040	4319240	stunts and manipulative in many ways, often rationalising the behaviour and dodging the
4319240	4324360	criticism equally. Some people have accused her of being a gold digger, but no, it's kinda sexist
4324360	4329080	as it underplays her role in the actual channel, they're a couple, they are both beneficiaries of
4329080	4332840	their own interaction with each other, which means that you can't tell if there's something
4332840	4337800	really wrong because you really only see what they want you to see. It leads to fundamental doubts in
4337800	4342120	the authenticity of the relationship, it doesn't mean that those doubts are correct, but you can
4342120	4346200	see where they come from. They both kind of contribute to this mess that we've gone through
4346200	4351240	today in their own unique way, and even though they have their supporters, they also have a lot
4351240	4356360	of enemies, and individuals who do not have the best experience with them. If the stupid subtweets,
4356360	4361560	angry Instagram rants, and publicity stunts didn't rub someone the wrong way, they'll find something
4361560	4365720	equally obnoxious that will. Do I think they're the worst? No. When you've had to experience
4365720	4371320	individuals like Daddy05, it puts it in perspective, they make a lot of people happy, and I can't deny
4371320	4375560	that, but they still behave in a way where people are gonna lose out. There are incidents that have
4375560	4379640	maybe questioned their intent, which is important when you're dealing with a larger young audience
4379640	4384120	who are prone to exploitation, and I haven't even spoken about every incident. They're promoting a
4384120	4388920	message to millions of people, and some are going to take issue with that, especially when it's poorly
4388920	4394120	delivered, it is inevitability. They can't be upset at that principle, they can be upset when people
4394120	4399960	falsely accuse stuff that might jeopardise the private life of individuals involved, and cause trust rifts
4399960	4404680	where they may not be warranted. As said, I can't tell you how much of what's been said is true,
4404680	4409640	but I'd probably be pretty upset too. Equally be aware that provided Cole's allegations are false,
4409640	4414280	it is probably a cause of crying wolf, their behaviour building up a negative perception so that
4414280	4418920	when something negative happened to them, people took the easiest explainable route. The point is
4418920	4423480	though, sometimes the wolf is actually there. It's important to remember that people who've been wrong
4423480	4428680	can be in the right, but it's also a case for why the Ace Family should try and build a better rapport
4428680	4433560	with their critics. Family channels are changing, Austin McBroom, the Ace Family, definitely seek to
4433560	4438200	pursue a different relationship with their audience, and on principle, I can respect that. However,
4438200	4443640	their conduct in other ways certainly hasn't been as high to a standard as many would hope, and the
4443640	4448600	standard does have to be kind of higher for a family channel, not just for the sake of the audience,
4448600	4453320	but for the children. I hope they really do feel involved with their channel because it's not something
4453320	4457400	you should force. Right now, the kids are really young, so they're unlikely to specifically remember
4457400	4462360	that much, but this sort of stuff can still really affect the development of a child. I hope they get
4462360	4466840	out of this drama-embroiled side of YouTube, and learn how to deal with the nature of controversy
4466840	4470520	a bit better. At the end of the day, people are still going to look up to them as role models,
4470520	4475240	they're still a monumentally sized channel, and they're still parents. I hope all innocents
4475240	4479720	prevailing, they have the chance to have that family life they sometimes claim to desire.
4480360	4486200	I've never thought about stopping, but I feel like if we... I've thought about it.
4488760	4493880	Really? Yeah. Really? I have.
4493880	4495640	That is, if they really want it.
4497560	4503720	So yes, that's the video. What a fun time we had here, it has been banging. Go and check out Jay
4503720	4509400	Aubrey, he is a darling, we love him so much on this channel. This is the first time he's actually
4509400	4515080	been on I think, and hopefully not the last. He's a great creator, and I can't endorse him enough,
4515080	4519240	most people probably know him at this stage, but hey, go and check him out if you haven't.
4519240	4523000	I also wanna give a shout out to the editors, once again a lot of editors on this one,
4523000	4527720	and they all got a deliver, and hopefully like the postman, they did. If they didn't, well...
4527720	4530040	There'll be rations in the dungeon for a few days.
4530040	4541560	I'd also like to give a big thank you to my Patreons, $10 Patreons are up on screen right now,
4541560	4549560	and big, big thank you to some hullabaloo Nico Deschamps and Caroline, $50 Patreons, thank you
4549560	4555400	so much, you're fantastic, I really appreciate it, and a very special thanks to my $100 Patreon,
4555400	4560280	Brandon, fabulous, Brandon's been here for so long, you gotta love that, you love to see it,
4560280	4565800	I love to see it, thank you Brandon, you're the, you're the mother, you're the motherfucking G,
4565800	4571640	you're the G. My Twitter, at TheRightOpinion, you can reach me on there, I do respond to DMs there,
4571640	4576280	Facebook, I haven't responded to DMs for a while, I need to check that out, and Discord, links in
4576280	4580040	the pinned comment, you can go and check it out, I'm gonna try and be more active in all of it,
4580040	4584040	but it's all over the place because I'm all over the place, that's how I roll, you probably know
4584040	4587960	that by now, other than that I don't really have too much else to add, take care of yourselves
4587960	4592680	guys, hope you're having a good week, and I'm sending my love out to all of you.
