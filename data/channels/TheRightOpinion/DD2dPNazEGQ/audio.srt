00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,860
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

2
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:21,260
and families, my god, do I love families, whoop whoop whoop. Humor aside, the family is an important staple in the many

3
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:26,880
societies that we do indeed live in. As a concept, it has been around for longer than I can remember, and although

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,000
many of us do have various goals, there are many people who would just like to settle down with a partner who loves

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,600
them and raise a few kids. It's a completely fair perspective, and one that I hope people have the opportunity to

6
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,560
fulfil. It's definitely something that I would like to do at one point in my life, though I'm not entirely sure when.

7
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:49,280
However, I think many of us have a very idealised version of how these things would play out, and although it often

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:56,160
takes a few attempts to get it right, and a few more for some, and a few more for others, maybe a few more on top of

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,140
that, it's still something we like to hold on to, which is where the idea of family vlogging comes into play.

10
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:08,440
Vlogs appeal to the audience under the notion that they can represent a life that we may idolise and feel an affinity with,

11
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,960
that's what has made so many of these wealthy vloggers famous from the start. However, it's important that these people

12
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,240
can place themselves in the vloggers position, and that the life they envision can be channelled through a relatable

13
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:25,440
individual. There was a time when a majority of audiences on YouTube liked to envision their lives as the sweet, wholesome

14
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,360
ones that will one day be blessed with the same glorious tidings that so many of those lovely vloggers have earned

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,440
themselves. However, at some point in the last few years, I've noticed a shift. I noted it in my Emma Chamberlain video,

16
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:43,880
that hey, I guess people are feeling kinda cynical now, and I mean who can blame them, the world is a depressing place,

17
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:50,440
and I guess everyone is just kind of in that mood, and out of that rose a new line up of stars who were slightly more

18
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:56,600
controversial than the previous ones. There are positives and negatives to this, but at least it gives us something to talk

19
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:03,840
about. Now, this didn't have to be particularly negative in a way, it just meant slightly more loud, obnoxious, and less subtle.

20
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,240
We're gonna make her worst nightmare come true.

21
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:13,160
This was a case in every genre, and eventually the penny dropped in the family genre too. You know, you don't have to pretend

22
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:20,040
that everything's perfect, how about conflict and storm? People love melodrama, you just need energy, some ideas,

23
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:27,040
a bit of money, and of course, a partner and a kid. I mean, hey, they can't be too hard to find, especially if you're as dashing

24
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,520
as the man known as Austin McBroom.

25
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,680
Austin McBroom- I enjoy catching the ball, I enjoy just having a blast with the teammates on the field and off the field.

26
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,880
Oh yeah. Austin McBroom is the husband and father of the Ace family, now he is an individual who is obviously known

27
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:49,280
primarily on YouTube. However, at one point, it seemed his career was not destined there, as that clip showed he was a very

28
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:55,560
sporting-oriented individual, and was highly rated in the basketball scene, and to be fair, the dude had some moves,

29
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,760
he could shoot some hoops. Given his prominence, you could say he was kinda a low-key media figure, he had a previously

30
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,160
established audience due to his skills, and here's an old screenshot of his 2015 twitter long before the launch of his

31
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:15,160
YouTube channel, which had his three principles listed in his biography, one god, two family, three hoop.

32
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,440
A simple set of beliefs that had guided him to relative success in the basketball scene, and a tendency to write

33
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,240
inspirational tweets. One of the elements that was very noticeable on his twitter prior to the creation of his channel

34
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:33,120
was the love of his fiance Catherine. They had a fairly standard story behind them, they saw each other a couple times,

35
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,080
and then decided that actually they had feelings which led them to initiating this relationship and the subsequent birthing

36
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,480
of their daughter Elle. The run-up to their child had a fair bit of coverage on twitter, and a nice bit of hype

37
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,040
surrounding it, so I guess at that point they decided that their life was interesting enough to start a YouTube channel.

38
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:58,120
Hey guys, welcome to our YouTube channel, this is our first Q&A, you guys sent us a bunch of questions that we picked out.

39
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,760
Now, when I looked at their old content, and I saw that their first video was a Q&A, I thought they were pulling my leg,

40
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,240
that's some bullsey confidence in your character to open your channel with a Q&A video. Now, from looking at an old

41
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,440
social blade screenshot, it's possible that they had some other videos up, but deleted them before launch,

42
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,480
so I guess they just used the already existent clout that they had surrounding Austin's basketball career,

43
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:25,040
and his relationship to launch the channel. They originally were called the incredible name of Austin and Catherine Vlogs,

44
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,520
before changing it to the Ace family, Ace representing the initials of each family member's name, Austin, Catherine, and Elle.

45
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,960
They do have another child now, Elle, but I guess the Ace family didn't quite have the same ring to it.

46
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:43,400
They started off on a fair wave of momentum, and have since built on that, accumulating over 17 million subscribers,

47
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:49,360
in the space of three and a half years. So what's the big deal? Family vlogs are here to stay.

48
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:56,000
Well, although vloggers have always taken on their fair share of drama, there seems to be something more about the Ace family,

49
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:03,040
and even more specifically, the man of the house, Austin McBroom, in that he may not be practicing what he preaches,

50
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,840
and treating those around him with the respect that may be expected.

51
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,640
After all, this family is a family who's very grateful.

52
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:17,440
Austin McBroom- Living life to the fullest, like we're keeping God first, being good people, and just trying our best to inspire others.

53
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:25,800
We're doing our best, as far as using our platform in order to do greater things, and inspire people,

54
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,200
and that's really how we feel every single day, and like, we just get so excited to do things for people,

55
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,400
and if you can't already tell, like, that's just in our nature, and that's what we love to do.

56
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,760
A family grateful for many things, but sometimes more than words is necessary to convince people that you believe it,

57
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:49,520
and that is what has been in question over the last couple years, ultimately climaxing in a situation very recently involving much more serious claims,

58
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,800
although I have a lot to say about the validity of those.

59
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,720
This is not going to be just about Austin, in fact, Catherine is probably going to be receiving a fair bit of scrutiny as well,

60
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,520
so don't worry, everyone's going to receive their fair share of discourse.

61
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,720
Let's have a discussion to see if the Ace family are really as ace as they've proclaimed to be,

62
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,120
or if behind the candelabra, they're not quite the role models that many see them as.

63
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,960
Well, fellas, I'm ready to get up and do my thing, I wanna get into it, man, you know?

64
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:22,200
And yes, that was a James Brown reference, because, well, I'm a sex machine. Let's go.

65
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,520
I want to start off this part with a quick disclaimer.

66
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,640
If there's one red flag that will immediately make me question a creator's desire to produce realistic organic content,

67
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,840
it's the notion of pranks.

68
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,800
Now, of course, not just any pranks, I'm sure there are some great pranks out there,

69
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,800
but you know, that brand of prank that I'm talking about, Roman Atwood, FouseyTube, Joey Salads, Prank Invasion, all that jazz.

70
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,000
The reason that I make this statement is because for many of you YouTube veterans,

71
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,960
you will know that these pranks were all blatantly fake.

72
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,920
The reason for making these pranks fake was because there was never a standard presented by an audience that we'd expect them to make the content genuine.

73
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,720
People valued the stunt over the sentiment behind it.

74
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,560
On top of this, the fakeness ensured the safety of the individual involved,

75
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,040
particularly when they partook in inflammatory stunts which may cause emotional harm to another individual.

76
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,680
Now, honestly, the Ace Family were probably far from the worst in this area,

77
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,600
and the topics that they faked probably didn't have many social repercussions,

78
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,880
but when I found out that a lot of their most viewed videos were pranks,

79
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,720
and seeing it as how they kicked off their channel, I started to become a bit concerned.

80
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,320
I don't have much confidence in these channels because honestly,

81
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,880
I believe that any channel prepared to sell an audience's pranks won't shy away from selling the audience anything else.

82
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,640
However, it is a case of positive proof, and I am a judgmental person in this instance,

83
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,000
but my first impressions of the family were not optimistic to say the least.

84
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,800
One of my concerns with channels that fake these things is that they don't really have much concern for their actual relationship with their audience,

85
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:58,480
and only care about how the audience sees them, which allows them to partake in exploitive behaviours that the audience overlooks.

86
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,560
This is one of the running criticisms when I was accumulating a list of topics that were on the chopping board today,

87
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,960
that they pretend to care, and actually just exploit the relationship whenever they can,

88
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,480
which is a pretty cynical perspective, but once again, to fulfil such a claim, we need proof.

89
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,160
Let's talk about the incidents that have drawn this criticism, starting with their charity work.

90
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:24,440
To many audiences, charity work seems like an unmitigated positive, those who engage in charitable behaviour are often praised,

91
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:32,520
and rightly so. However, for the very cynical people, they may see charity as a phony way for a creator to try and gain reputation points,

92
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,160
which may lead to more negative exploitation in the future.

93
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:41,880
Now generally, I don't like to side with the latter perspective, because these sorts of things, even if they're stunts,

94
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:51,160
can bring a lot of positive attention to good causes, but I also have to note as a premise that doing charity work does not make you an inherently good or trustworthy person,

95
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,200
which is where we look at the Ace Family's charity work.

96
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:01,400
And lastly, to spice it up a little bit, the person I picked for the one-on-one competition, after he's done taking an L, we're gonna play five-on-five.

97
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:09,000
He will pick his four other guys, and I will pick my four other guys, and the winner of that game will receive a $100,000 check to donate to charity.

98
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,200
Each player on that team will get a portion of the money to donate to their charity of choice, and guys, that's the best part about this event,

99
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,720
is to be able to give back. To us, there's nothing better in the world than to give back.

100
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:25,080
The Ace Family love to give back, and so when they announced that they were hosting a charity basketball event in June 2018,

101
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:34,360
obviously, in the spirit of Austin's game of choice, people were excited. As heard, the winner of the game would receive $100,000 to donate to charity,

102
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:44,040
a very noble cause indeed. The event came around, it was a huge success, it seemed that people had a great time, and they even donated that $75,000?

103
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:50,200
Alrighty then. This caught fairly immediate criticism, as it was not the amount they had originally pledged to donate.

104
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:57,640
Many theorised that given the sales, they should have made over $500,000 from the event, but others argued that given the costs,

105
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:04,680
it is possible that $75,000 was actually a reasonable amount to donate, and besides, $75,000 was better than nothing,

106
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:11,240
any sort of discussion around how much they made is very grey, and so it's hard to tally up cost-profit margins.

107
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:19,160
However, if I was in their shoes, given the money involved, if the donation fell short, I probably would have just filled in the remaining money myself,

108
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:26,280
or at least tried to explain to my audience the situation. The closest they get to doing that is this clip from what I understand.

109
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:32,600
They took $11 from each ticket for ambulances to be there on spot.

110
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:38,280
But even then, the explanation is rather insufficient, as pointed out by epic YouTuber Pyrocynical.

111
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:45,880
So let's take $11 off each ticket, but that's still a fraction of the possible profit he made compared to the money he gave away.

112
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:52,360
Also, he might have even hired the stadium for a discounted price, or even for free, because this was a charity event.

113
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,240
But I like money.

114
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:59,160
And regardless, you want to honour your commitment to charity, they were selling merch at like $65 a piece at the event,

115
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:06,440
and I feel they could have afforded it. I'm sure the money went to the right cause, I just sincerely hope they did donate every last cent,

116
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,640
because the next few events may make you doubt that they did.

117
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:16,360
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, well, shame on me, but still, significant amount of shame on you too.

118
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:22,280
And once again, the source of the controversy came from a basketball event, involving $100,000.

119
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,080
I mean, it's like they're baiting their audience at this point.

120
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:30,360
So in this video, Oster announces he's doing another giveaway, this time actually $100,000,

121
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,320
and he'll be giving it to anyone who can shoot 10 consecutive hoops in a basketball competition.

122
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,240
It sounds pretty easy to me. If you think you can do it, hit us up.

123
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,840
If you think your favourite YouTuber or celebrity can do it, make sure you tag them.

124
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,880
I also put the video on my Instagram, so make sure you tag them in the comments.

125
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,920
Guys, it's a free $100,000, you don't have to pay to enter.

126
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:56,520
Although, we suggest, it's up to you, but we suggest whoever wins, donates a portion to charity.

127
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,600
You all know, Catherine, I love giving back.

128
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,640
Now, given the rather general language, him talking about YouTubes,

129
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,040
but also talking about anyone who thinks they're good enough, in both his video and his announcement tweet,

130
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,560
you'd expect this competition to be open to anyone, right? Wrong.

131
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:15,240
Austin just listed 20 already fairly wealthy individuals who definitely weren't just randomly selected.

132
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,360
It kinda sucked, and to add insult to injury during the competition,

133
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,160
he invites one of his other basketball playing friends down who wasn't even on the original list to play,

134
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,800
and that guy wins it. $100,000, which once again, doesn't mean much to anyone.

135
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,760
People were fairly annoyed, because they did feel misled,

136
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,120
not because he actively stated that he was going to be inviting his fans,

137
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,560
but because he has shown in the past that he is completely capable of clarifying when he only wants influencers,

138
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,320
such as the last basketball game.

139
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,560
What that means is, I am going to challenge anyone with a support system,

140
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:53,320
whether that be a YouTuber, whether that be a celebrity, whether that be an artist, whether that be a baby.

141
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:59,240
So basically, you want to play against someone who has a fan base, that can bring a fan base?

142
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,960
Yes.

143
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,320
Someone that has support?

144
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,880
Yes.

145
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,280
When he said the competition was open to people,

146
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,320
people had the impression that he would be inviting anyone, thus imposing these false expectations.

147
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:15,000
The only comment that could remotely be interpreted in the direction of saying it's more influence-focused is this one.

148
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,360
So this is a new year. Everyone wants the new year to be better than the last year,

149
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,360
so our first video in the new year was a video dedicated to all of our ace family members.

150
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,120
So now we want to do something fun and entertaining for the social media world.

151
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:32,040
After watching this around five times, I came to the conclusion that he was implying this would be focused away from the fans,

152
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:38,040
but it was a vaguely delivered statement, and in the context of the whole video, you'd completely receive a different impression.

153
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,120
Again, it's not a huge deal, it's just strange why he didn't seek to make it clearer,

154
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:48,120
maybe because he thought it wouldn't be high enough stakes if everyone already knew that a rich person was winning 100,000?

155
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,880
Maybe he's just bad at explaining things without Catherine there.

156
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,280
Nonetheless, it's not a huge deal, he can quickly clear it up, right?

157
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:04,280
I didn't expect to find any of Austin's response, but I did, and now I understand why he doesn't normally respond,

158
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:09,800
because wow, that's a bad response. It's hard to work out exactly what he's saying here or the logic,

159
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,440
but he basically seems insulted that people have a problem when he's done so much,

160
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:20,360
and that if you're a true ace family member, you must appreciate everything else the mighty Austin McBroom does,

161
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,600
and take no issue with his decisions.

162
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,360
His other response was at the end of the charity video, to the criticism that everyone was rich, so they didn't need money.

163
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,560
Man, it feels so good to like, cause a lot of people kept saying, yo, give it to someone who needs it,

164
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,960
like they kept saying, everyone in the event, you know, makes a lot of money, so they don't need it.

165
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:43,160
Guys, you don't know what people's situations are, so you don't know how much someone makes at all, right?

166
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:48,600
But for someone who actually really needed it, I picked someone out of the stands that wasn't even in the contest,

167
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,640
just because we really wanted to give it away, and I felt like he had a good shot.

168
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:58,040
Next thing you know, he wins, okay? That's dope, that's such a cool story.

169
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,640
Fair enough, I guess.

170
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,800
Well, once again, the problem arose with the fact that this comment seemed purposely dishonest,

171
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:11,320
as the winner, Austin Mills, is the son of Jade Mills, a luxury real estate agent who has over 5 billion in sales.

172
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,720
Now, I cannot comment on a son's relationship with his ostensibly rich mother,

173
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,400
but it definitely made McBroom's comments look a bit ridiculous.

174
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,200
It's the Ace Family's channel, but the behaviour surrounding the stunt seemed insulting to the audience's

175
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:30,360
intelligence, arrogant, and all around a bit mean-spirited, and for someone who's so humble and intent on giving back,

176
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,920
you'd think he wouldn't react as if he was a god who felt people went praying enough to him.

177
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,040
Why would it be so hard to apologise for a misunderstanding that seemed honestly purposely vague?

178
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,200
I don't know, let's talk about it more.

179
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:57,640
One of the things that I've noticed is that when being faced down with serious criticism,

180
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,440
the Ace Family doesn't really like talking about it, and when they do, it's typically not with the most finesse.

181
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,880
They have two options, they can respond, which we've partly observed already, or they can ignore and elicit sympathy

182
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:14,680
through what may appear to be unrelated methods, but honestly, I'm not sure if they're as coincidental as one might assume.

183
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,800
Let's begin with the former, how they act when they respond.

184
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,880
I've already criticised them for their response to people's annoyance about the basketball game,

185
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:27,160
which although not the biggest deal, did demonstrate a lack of competence, but there is another great situation

186
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,840
which once again illuminates this, and probably a few more points as well.

187
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:38,760
We've been getting a lot of comments lately, asking us what happened, what happened with the Ace Family

188
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:47,800
in this truck, so we just wanted to address it, and let you guys hear first hand from our mouths, what really happened.

189
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,720
This is one involving an individual by the name of Urban Trademark 7, he's a designer, he makes some pretty slick designs,

190
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,040
and he felt that McBroom had ripped him off.

191
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:02,360
I guess, you know, he came across the merchandise again and he bought a couple items, and he had asked Bobby like,

192
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:08,680
yeah, do you know the dude that makes these, and Bobby, I guess, told him like, yeah, you know, I know him,

193
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:15,080
but all his information is on the label, so if you wanna reach out to him, you know, that's Instagram,

194
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:21,480
and all his contacts is on there, so he reached out from the text messages that I post, and I was like,

195
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,880
for sure, let's link up and try to put something together then.

196
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,520
To explain in a bit more depth, it appears that Austin had seen and purchased some of Urban's designs

197
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,320
while out and about in local stores, and had asked after him. Apparently, he really liked the designs,

198
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,040
and had fans who he felt would appreciate some merchandise made in the style of that content.

199
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:46,280
So then from there, I was like, alright, well, what I can do is I can make a couple exclusively for you,

200
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:51,160
and then we can sell them, and then, you know, when I link back up, I'll make them, when I link back up,

201
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,760
we can negotiate like the price.

202
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,480
So they decide to convene and discuss the prospects of working on some collaborative content.

203
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,760
So it appears that they were going to work on some designs together before finalising the financial side of it.

204
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,400
There's also something about a colouring book that I think Urban wanted McBroom to promote as well,

205
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,720
one that he gifted to McBroom's daughter, although McBroom didn't want to take a picture with him,

206
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,000
which he found suspicious due to disassociation in a way.

207
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,320
So yeah, so I'm like, oh, I'm gonna give a... Intensely, I was just like, I'm gonna give a book to his daughter,

208
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,360
cause I made the book for my daughter, that's what inspired me, and I'm like, he has a little one,

209
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,840
so I want to give her a colouring book.

210
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:33,240
So on my way out, when we got to the car, I give him the colouring book, and I'm like, hey, you know,

211
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,800
this is for your daughter, you know, just give it to her if you can, you know, take a picture,

212
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,280
you know, just trying to promote the book for kids.

213
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,640
He was like, he was like, dope, that's for sure, I got you.

214
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,200
And I was like, do you mind if I get a picture with you with the book?

215
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,880
He instantly like froze up for a second, was like, nah, nah, let's just wait, man, I only take professional pictures.

216
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,320
And I was like, all right, for sure.

217
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,720
The conversation continued over the following days, with Urban presenting the designs to McBroom,

218
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,880
who said he'd been busy. What was he busy with?

219
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,880
Well, allegedly copping Urban's own designs, and then selling them himself,

220
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:09,400
even one regarding an ice cream truck that the Ace Family allegedly nabbed for one of their subscriber specials

221
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,000
just under a year later.

222
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,800
And then a couple days later, I seen on YouTube, he had on the band, some bands that looked like my bands,

223
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,000
with him and his daughter.

224
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,360
They was mad thicc.

225
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,320
They was mad thicc, they wasn't, I just know my work.

226
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,160
And I was like, I was like, Lika, come here, look at this.

227
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,880
And she's like, nah, nah, nah.

228
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,760
And then, so then I basically, that's what you see from the text, I hit him up.

229
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,560
I'm like, bro, what's up with this?

230
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:43,000
Those messages when we were put here is basically what inspired, you know, transpired.

231
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,880
People do that, man.

232
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:52,040
People get really influenced and rip you off so fast that I'm not the only one that's been done too, I'm pretty sure.

233
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,920
But, so I kind of like, I took it with a grain of salt.

234
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:01,080
Another thing was dope is I'm working on a truck that I'm about to drop,

235
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:07,720
that we can like basically do pop-ups where every band that I make exclusively for you,

236
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,040
we pop up, we could sell them, and then, you know, it's love.

237
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,960
So I tell him the whole get down about the truck and how I used to have a store,

238
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,040
and now I feel like mobile is the new wave.

239
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,440
And like, you know, and he's like, oh man, that shit is like, that shit sound genius.

240
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,720
I felt some type of way.

241
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:30,600
And that's when I was like, oh, nah, I gotta, I gotta expose this dude because, you know,

242
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,480
and then when it's crazy, because when I posted about the truck, people was hitting me up mad DMs,

243
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,120
like, you're not the only one he ripped off.

244
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,080
They had a subsequent confrontation and Instagram DMs,

245
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,120
and Urban felt provoked eventually into making a video

246
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,320
with the publication of this ice cream truck instant.

247
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,840
It's hard to exactly measure the verifiability of these claims.

248
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,320
It appears that a lot of what was said was true about the circumstances surrounding it.

249
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,440
The difficulties come into the fact that it's difficult to exactly argue

250
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,240
how much was plagiarized in a way and how much McBroom just decided to do in his own style.

251
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,320
But regardless, it's a shame they couldn't communicate these differences more effectively.

252
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,440
And the whole ice cream truck scenario is a bit suspicious,

253
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,720
though because the vagueness in the language in the DMs that I've seen,

254
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,760
it's difficult to once again say exactly what's gone on.

255
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,680
No one really admits to much.

256
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,240
However, as said, this was about response.

257
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,080
And once again, Austin demonstrated his exceptional class.

258
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,160
Saw some headbands, hit him up, wanted to collab.

259
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,880
He didn't want to collab with me because he tried to say that the headbands were expensive.

260
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,640
He was bullshitting.

261
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,760
He was trying to get over on me.

262
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,720
So I said, you know what, bruh?

263
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,800
You know what?

264
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,960
I'm going to have my grandma making my own headbands

265
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,920
because everybody sell headbands in the stores.

266
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,600
All the stores sell headbands.

267
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,160
You ain't the first headband maker.

268
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,520
Who the fuck you think you are?

269
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,720
You the inventor of headbands?

270
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,600
You idiot.

271
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,440
So I made my own headbands.

272
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,240
He got mad because I posted it and I had a little following.

273
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,800
He got mad.

274
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,160
Was wearing my headbands with L.

275
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,400
He was like, this dude, he tried to take my idea.

276
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,280
He took the idea where you put the banner on your head and you cross it and you tie it

277
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,640
and you put it in your head.

278
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,760
He stole that from me.

279
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,720
Austin from the ACE family stole my art and I don't like him.

280
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,240
Don't like him, right?

281
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:21,880
So then a year later, just like Fred, the ACE family's blowing up.

282
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,640
I'm itching for that clout pill.

283
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,520
I need that clout.

284
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:25,960
ACE family blowing up.

285
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,640
They got over 10 million subs.

286
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm trying to get some attention.

287
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,480
He comes out after we have made an ice cream truck from SD Wraps.

288
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,960
They literally customize this random as fuck.

289
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,040
They came up with it with their own brain.

290
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,480
They made the ice cream truck literally in a day, right?

291
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,760
We release it.

292
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,960
He tries to come out and say, we took his idea from getting an ice cream truck.

293
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,520
You know how many ice cream trucks are out there?

294
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,480
That's the real positivity we love to see.

295
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,240
And I'm making a slight observation here, but he's a bit of a dick.

296
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:06,040
Once again, I can't tell you if this is true because I haven't seen any real counter-revelance.

297
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,240
I'm open to alternative stories as the DMs were pretty vague,

298
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,240
but he's just so angry and petulant about it that you kind of want to hate him.

299
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,280
And this is one of the problems with the ACE family and most notably Austin's lack of empathy.

300
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,320
It was the same problem that made his response to the basketball

301
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,600
competition feel disconnected from what people were trying to say.

302
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,760
Now, it's clear this isn't a formal response, so I can't judge it too seriously,

303
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,000
but he just seems so angry at this guy because he sees anyone who criticizes like that as a

304
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,920
clout chaser, even though he was only provoked by one specific incident later,

305
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,040
which clearly bothered him.

306
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,440
It was clear Urban was upset at the time, and the DMs, even if they were vague,

307
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,680
showed a genuine pain, and Austin taps into that during that conversation,

308
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:51,400
saying in the messages that Urban's coming at him like a woman, a very classy man.

309
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,120
The contempt implies that he just can't acknowledge that he's ever made any missteps,

310
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,520
or why anyone would ever be upset at him.

311
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,800
And I think that rubs people the wrong way, it rubbed me the wrong way.

312
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:06,360
Disclaimer, the problem of a lack of empathy is going to be a running theme in this video.

313
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,440
When you see that side of Austin, it does bring into contention the notion and motives for the

314
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,840
way that he interacts with his audience, he always speaks about him wanting to give back,

315
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,240
but when people might come at him from an angle that implies they feel dissatisfied with his

316
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,800
behaviour, he just doesn't seem to clock it.

317
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,600
Selfless philanthropy in the way that the ACE family promotes is based on empathy for others,

318
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,160
and it adds a shade of scepticism when they seem to demonstrate a lack of it in other areas.

319
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:35,640
It doesn't necessarily prove an inability, but when you frame yourself in a way that anyone

320
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,240
criticising you is a bad faith actor, and true ACE family members know how much they really do,

321
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,960
it just gives me Greg Paul vibes, but whereas Greg Paul was overly defensive of destructive

322
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,880
behaviour from his children, McBroom seems to have a basic ego problem.

323
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,400
I don't want to doubt that the ACE family clearly do a fair bit for their audience,

324
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,200
it's clear given their interaction, and I respect that, but it's hard to deny that they have fallen

325
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,160
short at point, and when you fall short again, and again, and again, the criticism will begin

326
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:08,040
to accumulate, and as said, Austin isn't one for official statements, unless they're completely

327
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:13,000
unrelated to the actual criticism. What do I mean? Well, in spite of the fact that the ACE family

328
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,400
seldom demonstrates sympathy for their critics, they're more than ready to expect it themselves,

329
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,560
and often at opportune times, so I wanted to focus on this for the next part.

330
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,280
I've already talked about a couple of instances where they seem to undermine standards that many

331
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:31,080
would consider standard for that of a creator their size, but it does not end there. As a

332
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,560
successful creator, it's likely that you may want to engage your audience through other mediums,

333
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:40,200
this is something that the ACE family decide to pursue with the launch of their ACE family app.

334
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,600
Now looking at it in its current state, reviews are overwhelmingly positive, so hopefully any

335
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:49,320
problems there have been resolved, however at the time there were many people who had felt ripped

336
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,720
off due to the lack of content. There were a couple of reasons for this, at least as I

337
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,520
understand, and therefore the ACE family felt it was a good time to take a break.

338
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:04,600
This is actually happening, we will be taking a break from YouTube.

339
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:10,280
Not telling you guys how long, just yet, but we are taking a break. During our break,

340
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,640
which is why we said it wasn't really going to be a break, we'll be focusing on our app along with

341
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,160
our merch. For all the people who have the ACE family membership, we cannot thank you guys enough

342
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:26,360
for all the love and support you continue to show us. Just know we have a lot coming, we're not going to say too much, we just want to upload exclusive content and show you guys.

343
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,480
As many people interpreted this, it meant that they were going to be making content for the ACE family app, and therefore

344
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,720
creating a paywall between them and some of their less privileged viewers. As said, there were

345
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,800
complaints that they won't provide enough content on the app to justify the additional payment,

346
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,440
so basically it felt like they were kind of failing on both fronts. Generally, unless you're

347
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,080
really strapped for cash, it's good to make exclusive content as a bonus rather than taking

348
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,920
it away from your public content. However, a break is a break, and in their defence, it's hard to say

349
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:00,360
whether their comments were in reference to working on plans of their app or just the content itself.

350
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:06,120
I feel that this situation was likely a boiling over of other situations, but it's clear that the ACE

351
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,240
family at this point, after a run of controversies, probably had enough. This was all occurring in

352
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:16,760
January of 2019, one of their most controversial months, with reference to the 100k basketball

353
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:22,520
competition, and another incident involving the purchasing of a phallic lollipop for a child, which

354
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,560
we'll get to later. Now, many people were focusing on the app at this point, but when they announced

355
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:32,520
a break, I found it coincided very conveniently with the announcement of what is now known as the

356
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:38,040
ACE family documentary, Welcome to Our Life. Now, to defend them on this front, this was probably a

357
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:43,560
conceptual idea before the drama, but given their selected break that ends with their return, it's

358
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:48,760
very easy to think where their focus in the ensuing month may have been. I don't know how much they

359
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,400
worked on their merch or their app, but I think they had a bit of focus on this too. I like

360
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,200
documentaries on principle, hell, there's even a documentary out there on me, and it won't be the

361
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,840
last time that I try and make that sort of thing. From a filmmaking perspective, they can be really

362
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,320
great, but I think one of my biggest problems with documentaries, even those like the ones from Shane

363
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,960
Dawson, is that they can easily control the narrative and are often trying to make a statement

364
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,920
on the actual character of an individual, rather than any greater message, and therefore it can be

365
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:22,600
utilised, particularly by larger YouTubers, for propaganda reasons. It's very easy for an individual

366
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,880
to own a narrative when they own the camera, even when they say it's behind the scenes. Behind the

367
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:32,600
scenes documentaries were often gritty, and characters were sometimes unlikable because they

368
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:37,240
had a unique value in their performance that no one else could substitute, and therefore their

369
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,840
whole behaviour came with them. The modern day YouTube documentary can be very easily hijacked

370
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,080
by an individual to elicit sympathy from their audience, and that's the impression I received

371
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:51,720
when I heard about the Ace Family documentary. How do they follow through on it?

372
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:58,120
And what we do is so difficult, I feel like people don't understand that there's really

373
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,040
nothing private in our lives anymore.

374
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:07,080
I decided to take on the burden of watching these episodes of it in case they said anything of interest,

375
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:12,280
and the first episode was harmless enough, they talk about moving around and privacy issues, and although

376
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:18,920
I wouldn't exactly consider $1500 a month apartment a struggle, it was alright. I understand that as

377
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:24,120
public figures, they probably have a stressful life. My feelings were slightly mellowed by the end of the

378
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,120
first episode, however they went straight into it with the second.

379
00:29:54,120 --> 00:30:02,920
I guess this is what many would consider an indirect response. It's completely coated with multiple other

380
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:07,320
narratives, and is what many YouTubers will do if they don't feel like they can give a direct

381
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:12,840
response to the criticism. They'll basically just create some straw man and say, wow, the haters do

382
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,200
suck. It reminds me of that Jake Paul rap, you know the one.

383
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:28,840
It sucks that media is often oriented towards the negative, but that's only because the negative actions

384
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,640
aren't what you'd expect from an individual. It's out of the ordinary, and therefore people are more

385
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,920
interested when a person indulges in it. That's not saying that you're a bad person, and mob mentality

386
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,240
can sometimes lead to the wrong impression, we're all aware of that now, but to act as if all the

387
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,280
backlash that you receive is representative to, for example, people being upset over tweets made

388
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,760
seven or eight years ago is extremely deceptive. Does it mean that those people don't exist?

389
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:58,440
Not at all, but they're certainly not representing the majority of what people are likely bothered by.

390
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,600
Basically, this whole scene felt like Austin wanted to create something vague enough to

391
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:08,760
invalidate and engrave it in the docuseries that throws in other, maybe very legitimate struggles,

392
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,680
in an attempt to elicit sympathy from an audience that probably hasn't thought about

393
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,360
the distinction between legitimate criticism and illegitimate criticism.

394
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:23,400
People go out of their way to make something seem so different of what it is.

395
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:32,440
Like, I literally just posted a snap of a Leia, like, me playing with her, her lay on her stomach,

396
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,840
having tummy time, and now I'm getting bashed for it. What do you mean? What are people, like, people saying

397
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:42,200
something? Like, yeah, they're saying I'm such a bad dad because I laid my newborn on her stomach,

398
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:47,560
when it's literally just tummy time, like, everyone knows about tummy time. I laid her on her stomach

399
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,760
to give her tummy time, I'm sitting there, like, making a cute snap with her,

400
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:58,040
and now people are bashing me for it. Like, this is why Catherine and I hesitate to film our kid.

401
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,600
He's representing the criticism that he receives by talking about this situation that I don't think

402
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:07,000
anyone with a brain is going to be thinking about. Then there's the implication spread to the point

403
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,040
that this is the sort of stuff being spoken about in the serious videos on him. He shows a reel of

404
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:17,560
those videos, which it really isn't. I get that people being overly critical, mob mentality,

405
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:22,120
they are all things that grind many of our gears, but to throw videos and to create this umbrella

406
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:27,240
is dishonest, and playing the sad music and implying sympathy with a title like the truth

407
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,840
about the Ace Family is about as heavy-handed as they come.

408
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:37,800
Like I've said before, we're human, and we've made some mistakes, I mean, like, we're not perfect,

409
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:43,880
but it doesn't mean that we're bad people, you know, and something coming out and circulating again

410
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,040
is literally purely just to make us look bad.

411
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,960
Here you are in a scene where they almost come to terms with their imperfections,

412
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,040
but then they flip it onto their head and say anyone releasing this stuff is just trying to

413
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,920
make us look bad, which given the criticism that I've discussed already is a fundamentally

414
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:05,480
redundant statement, given that some of these criticisms came from your own fans,

415
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,840
it's such an arrogant attitude that they try to masquerade in the oh woe is the struggle of the

416
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:16,200
Ace Family narrative. Listen, there are problems that come with fame, I can get why unnecessary

417
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,680
attention and criticism can bother you, but to speak generally and then provide an extreme

418
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:25,400
circumstance to try and explain why you're actually suffering is like Al Capone asking why

419
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:30,840
so many people were out to get him when all he did was evade taxes. Also, do you know how

420
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,000
to say the word frustrated? Because I'm feeling pretty flustrated right now.

421
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,040
Next part.

422
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:56,360
There's good criticism, and bad criticism. If you can't separate it, I don't really have much

423
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:01,080
respect for throwing an umbrella over it and arguing that they were the true victims. A lot of

424
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:06,680
the criticisms that they received could have been resolved fairly easily, only donating 75,000

425
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:12,680
donate an extra 25. Holding a basketball shootout where fans feel misled, do another one involving

426
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:17,000
your fans, or at least do something involving your fans as compensation. People feel like you've

427
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,000
screwed them over? Don't be a dick and go out and just talk a bunch of crap. It's not rocket science,

428
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,920
and I get you don't want to yield on every occasion, but there's a point where principle

429
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:32,120
pushes into stubbornness and you just end up looking unreasonable. And hell, when you actually

430
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:36,760
make a mistake and you receive criticism that you can't respond to, apologise, or at least

431
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,560
admit you got something wrong. The phallic lollipop is a prime example of something that

432
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:47,160
could have just been solved with a tweet saying it was inappropriate, my bad, but it wasn't.

433
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,840
The Ace Family are more than happy to admit they've made mistakes, but they'll never tell

434
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:55,800
you which specific ones because they don't want to actually admit to anything. I don't think it's

435
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,920
that demanding, and that's one of the things that I think just shows to me that McBroom has a

436
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,560
significant ego problem, that they just don't want to ever say they've done anything specific wrong,

437
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:10,760
and if you make any specific criticisms they will blow it up to a greatest character implication

438
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:15,960
and say, how dare you, we're not bad people. Not everyone's saying you're bad people. Some of these

439
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:21,240
critics are even your fans. It's very easy to see their whole documentary series as a beg for

440
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:26,040
sympathy towards conflicted fans who may be on the fence about their behaviour, and I personally

441
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,200
find it rather manipulative. The documentary was probably the most elaborate way to try and

442
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,680
retain fans, it was probably done in the light of the success these Shane Dawson videos had yielded

443
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:39,320
to, so it was a win-win. However, it's not the first time that people have accused them of baiting

444
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:44,280
for sympathy, no, there was an even more notorious incident in the year prior, not too long after they

445
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,560
had received a bitter stick for the 75k basketball situation. When something happens to you, it's

446
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:54,440
natural for you to receive people's sympathies, which is why sometimes people are a bit suspicious

447
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:59,000
about the motives of those who have terrible stuff happen to them not too long after they've

448
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,520
received some criticism. This was the case for the Ace Family, who had their house robbed in July of

449
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:09,960
2018, amongst a fairly decent wave of criticism. On one hand, this was met with a lot of sympathy,

450
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:15,000
and people understood why the Ace Family were distraught over this. However, very quickly,

451
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,080
suspicion began to boil up around the circumstances surrounding this incident.

452
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:24,920
Did the Ace Family arrange or stage their own break-in? However, ladies and gentlemen,

453
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,840
this is a crime scene, and we need someone on the case, so I have assigned Detective Jonathan

454
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:36,280
Jawbury to deal with this matter, and to see if we can work out what can be said about the situation.

455
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,600
I suggest we pass it over to him to present it and his subsequent findings.

456
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:47,640
Parents often play a critical part in forming their child's first relationships,

457
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,680
acting as a role model and exemplifying the types of behaviors they wish to see exhibited

458
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:57,480
by their own one day. As such, children will always turn out best when their parents are

459
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,640
there to nurture, love, and support them throughout their personal experiences,

460
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,320
which is why we need more parents shoving cameras down their kids' throats for the

461
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:10,120
sole purpose of internet clout. That was a joke. We don't need that at all, actually.

462
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:15,320
But regardless, family vlogs have always been an integral aspect of YouTube as we know it.

463
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:19,560
From the Shaytards all the way down to the Inghams, families will continue to play a

464
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:24,120
significant role in the online zeitgeist. And although it isn't necessarily for me,

465
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:28,760
I understand the appeal. People, children especially, crave the types of connections

466
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:33,240
that can be easily accessed through internet personalities. When you watch Cole and Seth,

467
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,480
for example, you aren't just another audience member, you're a part of their lives,

468
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:43,400
adding to the immense power these figures often wield. Kids and families trust that these types

469
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:49,000
of creators are being open and honest with them, giving them an elevated responsibility. Which is

470
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,480
why many believe these channels deserve to be held accountable for their actions,

471
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,800
hence why the Ace Family has been subject of such intense scrutiny.

472
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:09,560
On August 16th, 2018, the Ace Family made waves in the community by uploading their famed

473
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:14,280
Someone Broke Into Our House vlog, where the title pretty much tells you all you need to know.

474
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:52,520
Their vlog documents the aftermath of a supposed home invasion that took place while the three

475
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:57,800
were spending some quality time together at Disneyland. The half hour long video depicts

476
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:03,480
police cars, smashed belongings, ransacked closets, and of course Austin and Catherine

477
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,160
trying their absolute best to save face in the wake of a crisis.

478
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:26,760
They both make a clear effort to drive home the fact that, oh,

479
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:32,760
things can be replaced, but people, people can't. Which is nice, you know, I mean I don't think

480
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:38,200
you'll find many who disagree with that sentiment, but to me they just seem a little too calm and

481
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:43,800
collected to have just found out their 10 million dollar home was burglarized. Which was just the

482
00:39:43,800 --> 00:40:03,560
beginning of the suspicions more and more people would start to air. It's true that robberies can

483
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:09,080
happen to anyone, anywhere, at any given time, but to ignore the glaring circumstances surrounding

484
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:14,280
the family at the time of their break-in would be counterproductive. As James was quick to mention

485
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:19,560
earlier, people do crazy things for sympathy, especially those who make their living by

486
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:24,440
earning clicks online. Lord knows Austin and Catherine are no strangers to clickbait. Hell,

487
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,760
even if the robbery did happen, they still went out of their way to stage a whole ass thumbnail

488
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:34,680
to get that sweet, sweet CTR. It strikes me as a bit odd that just a few weeks prior to this

489
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:40,040
incident, the whole basketball controversy went down in which people accused the family of stealing

490
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:45,880
money from a charity event. So would it be within reason for someone in their position to stage a

491
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:51,400
fake tragedy for the simple aim of gaining pity? Yes. But does that mean, without a shadow of a

492
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:57,240
doubt, that the robbery was faked? No, not necessarily. Which is why we need to look at

493
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:02,120
the details of the proceeding before we do anything else. At first, people were already

494
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:06,600
suspicious of the way the police behaved on camera. Some viewers even going so far as to

495
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:26,520
insist that they weren't even a part of the LAPD. A theory that was later reinforced when a fan dug

496
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:32,920
up evidence of a place called Top Cop Shop in LA renting out fake police and squad cars on August

497
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:38,760
16th, the same night the robbery reportedly took place. Catherine was quick to dismiss this smear

498
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,640
campaign against her family on Twitter, though you can't really blame people for asking the question,

499
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:49,560
can you? Renting re-enactors is not particularly uncommon in reality TV, leading many to wonder if

500
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:54,760
they had just recreated the incident in an attempt to make their situation appear more dramatic for

501
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:59,560
YouTube. Perhaps the family had suffered an actual home invasion a day prior and,

502
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:04,840
being unsatisfied with the initial footage, rented out fake cops to hype it up for the cameras.

503
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:09,400
After all, it couldn't have been completely fabricated. The real police report was posted

504
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,120
by Keemstar on Twitter. Austin later appeared in an Instagram Live following the incident,

505
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:19,400
showing unedited footage of someone checking for fingerprints the next morning, although it's

506
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:24,600
pretty standard protocol to check for those kinds of things immediately after the incident takes

507
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,800
as to not disrupt the crime scene. So, you know, that's a little sus. He also announced that the

508
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,440
family would be moving to a new house since they no longer felt safe in their current home,

509
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:39,640
leading some to assume that they simply trashed the house and left it, though that's a bit of a

510
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:44,600
stretch considering it took almost an entire year for the move to officially happen, but even then

511
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:50,200
it's not completely off the table, and we never saw any footage of the actual robbery. A 10 million

512
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:55,960
dollar house is sure to come with cameras and alarm system at the very least, but despite their

513
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:01,160
abundant coverage of the situation, they never so much as mentioned any of that. It just comes off

514
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:06,040
so orchestrated to me, I don't know. Here we are being so honest with you guys, like you guys

515
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:12,440
say the craziest rumors about us, like the craziest things. Someone is making a fake receipt

516
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:19,240
of like us paying for cop actors, like these were real cops that were in her home. Like that's

517
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:23,640
against the law to do that, to fake a receipt, to fake an invoice, that's against the law.

518
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:28,600
That's crazy. That's slander. We have to leave our house, like we can't be here anymore,

519
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:34,360
as much as I'd love to continue living in my home, we have to leave because it's not safe.

520
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:38,520
Looking at the evidence, I believe something must have happened to them, but even that still leaves

521
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:43,640
room for more unanswered questions. Things like why didn't these robbers take the diamond play

522
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:49,160
button, and why was Austin filming the entire time as if to prove he wasn't hiding anything.

523
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,240
Someone in their position probably wouldn't have behaved as orderly, given the tremendous

524
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:58,280
shock and grief that must come along with getting your mansion ransacked while you're conveniently

525
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:03,160
out at Disneyland. The Ace family is in such a position to where they can literally lie about

526
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:07,000
anything to their audience, and they're not really going to be pressed for the real truth.

527
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,360
The dishonesty of this family runs deep, and whether this was staged or not, people have

528
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:17,880
every reason to question the parts of their life they publicized. The fact that this all came only

529
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:23,240
two weeks after some of Austin's old problematic tweets resurfaced, coupled with their apparent

530
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:28,280
inability to simply own up to their own mistakes, is enough to make anyone suspicious. But would

531
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:34,440
this family really go through all the trouble of hiring fake cops to drum up a sensationalist story

532
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:39,480
for the sole purpose of seeking reconciliation among their fanbase? That's something I'll let

533
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,960
you decide for yourself.

534
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:47,880
That was some intense detective work, but I'm proud to have YouTube's finest on the case, which I'm aware

535
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:53,160
is the equivalent of kindergarten cop, but I think Jon would make an excellent Arnold Schwarzenegger,

536
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:58,120
if Arnold Schwarzenegger was a tiny twink of course, but we love him all the same. I think probably

537
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:02,760
the most frustrating part of the whole ordeal was once again their reaction to the idea that people

538
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,640
may be doubting this. It's the same routine that we've seen time and time again, and you think they'd

539
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:13,320
just be a bit more understanding of what's come their way, but they just don't have a clue how to

540
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:19,000
fully get people to understand their perspective. Austin and Catherine have never been afraid to

541
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
present an image of themselves to the audience, but they're also masters in orchestrating the

542
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,960
representation of their lives, so house intrusions, whether legitimate or not, is obviously going to be

543
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:32,760
seen by many as part of the melodrama, and many others as a distraction to how they actually act

544
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,320
behind the scenes. However, even if they fake their intention for the good deeds, they're good

545
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:42,840
deeds, and if they provide the right message for aspiring creators and parents, then that can't be

546
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:50,280
a bad thing, right? But are they really truly virtuous, are they really who we should be looking up to?

547
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,120
I'm just not entirely sure they are.

548
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,680
Now as mentioned at the start, the move away from wholesome role models towards characters

549
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:05,640
that inspire more cynicism is something that is impossible to avoid. The Ace family is no real

550
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:10,520
exception to that rule, and I understand that, but I would also posit that in spite of this, family

551
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:15,720
channels should be held to a marginally higher standard than those of Jake Paul, because although

552
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:20,520
they are more than worthy of their criticism, like a lot of it, Jake Paul is at least the

553
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:25,480
representation of a dumb privileged frat boy who just moved in with his friends. His antics

554
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:30,200
represent a fleeting part of young adulthood that will eventually capitulate itself. He has the

555
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:35,560
inspirational garbage, but it's so unbelievably inept that no one really buys it. With the Ace

556
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:41,000
family, what they're doing is presenting this family life, which as mentioned, a cultural staple

557
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,960
to many, a necessary stage of growth, and a part of everyone's life, whether positive or negative.

558
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:51,240
On the one hand, I would hope that the Ace family realises their behaviour has an effect on probably

559
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:56,280
the workings of many other families. On the other hand, it makes what we're about to talk about worse.

560
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,280
I think this is what particularly vexed people are in the next couple of situations that we're

561
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:05,160
going to be discussing. Let's talk about the lollipop. This situation once again occurred

562
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:10,440
in January of 2019, as mentioned. Austin was taking a child out shopping, they go into what

563
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:15,960
I assume is a novelty shop, or a more adult oriented shop, and then shock horror, on his

564
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,120
Snapchat story, this is posted. He finds himself in some hijinks.

565
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:33,400
Oh no, I can't believe she wanted the penis shaped lollipop,

566
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,440
what madness. How on earth did that happen?

567
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:52,200
Keep that in the bag forever, do not show that to anybody, okay? That's your little secret.

568
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:59,160
Guys, I'm in so much trouble, but she said she's gonna steal it if I didn't buy it, so better me buy it.

569
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:04,680
Oh damn it, Austin, he had to buy it for her, or else she was gonna steal it, damn.

570
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:10,120
McBroom really got put in a tough situation here, I'm sure that everyone bought that very sincere

571
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:16,520
explanation, they didn't, and there was immediate criticism for Austin, because he bought a penis

572
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:21,640
shaped lollipop for a child, and then gave it to them. It was extremely inappropriate, and not the

573
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:26,520
sort of thing that you would hope a family YouTuber to be doing. It's hard for me to be particularly

574
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:32,360
angry, I was much angrier when Jake Paul just shouted at babies, so maybe I'm just desensitised

575
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:37,240
to penis, but I do agree with the criticism. No doubt Austin clearly wanted a funny story,

576
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:42,760
but knew he'd get stuck, so tried to pin the responsibility on the child. I think it illuminates

577
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:48,280
one of the biggest problems with children in family vlogs. In their little documentary series, they say this.

578
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:54,600
Like if Elle didn't like being in front of the camera, she was like, like if she was running away, and she wasn't

579
00:48:54,600 --> 00:49:00,920
like, you know, interacting, we would not be they family. No, we wouldn't, 100%. It would never be the same effect.

580
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:06,280
And I just find it as a comment, rather redundant. Children that young can't exactly say whether they

581
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:11,560
want to be on camera, even if they appear to enjoy it. Austin and Catherine constantly talk about how

582
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:15,960
their life has changed due to the attention in the series, but hardly take a look at how it's going to

583
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,200
affect a child at one of their most vulnerable times in their life. And when you're someone like

584
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:25,320
Austin who clearly finds some value in the drama, you know, not being criticised for it could have

585
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:30,440
genuine ramifications on your children. It's not like I'm against having children in family vlogs,

586
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:35,080
but I don't think they should be a part of the drama that Austin tends to involve himself in.

587
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:39,880
I don't think it happens on a rather excessive basis, but I think it's something worth noting,

588
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:44,600
especially when looking at these dramas. This isn't exclusive, but it's a cumulative criticism they

589
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:49,400
shouldn't ignore. Hell, one of their newest videos was originally titled as the children ranking

590
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:55,160
seductive Halloween costumes, and you can see why it bothers people. Infants aren't props, and their

591
00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:00,680
innocence and wellbeing should be prioritised over the acquisition of views. The fact that they never

592
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:05,480
really talk about these things just makes them poor role models, really, and I'll explain why now.

593
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:10,840
Take this recent issue where Austin acquired a jet ski, and decided to ride it around his mansion's

594
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:15,640
pool. According to many in the area, the amount of water discharged caused mudslides that created

595
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:20,200
additional problems in the neighbourhood, including negatively affecting property and a great

596
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:25,720
plantation, a complaint to have been made to the city but the antics continued. Now as far as I can

597
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:30,840
see, there's not really much to imply this isn't the Ace family, it adds up. So eventually this was

598
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:35,080
resolved in private, and Catherine did actually talk about it in their video, and removed the jet

599
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:38,440
ski from the accommodation, in which she made this statement.

600
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:43,320
Austin wanted to get into this jet ski, and there was nothing that I could do about it because,

601
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:49,400
you know, Austin is Austin. At the end of the day, you know, sometimes I kind of have to be a team

602
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:54,120
player, and accept some of the things that he's gonna do. To be honest with you guys, Austin has

603
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:59,400
been doing crazy things for the past couple of years, you guys know that. You guys should see the

604
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:04,680
things that didn't make it onto our channel because of me, so I'm like content patrol.

605
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:09,800
After the first time that he used it, we actually got a complaint we were actually unaware of.

606
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,800
The complaint went straight to our builder because the neighbour's actually friends with the builder,

607
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:18,280
and so he's like, hey man, like there's water coming down on my property. Like originally when

608
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:22,680
Austin rode the jet ski, I was under the impression, even Austin was under the impression, like no one

609
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:27,240
thought that the water would like reach anywhere else. Even though yes, water reaches in other

610
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:31,560
places, but because we have an infinity pool, we thought that the water was going down on like the

611
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:36,040
bottom, or like the drainage part. Since we have like all this land that goes all the way down,

612
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:40,360
we thought, oh it's just water, like you know, it's not gonna go anywhere. There's not that much water.

613
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:45,160
So he hit our builder up, and he was like, hey like there's some water going here. So our builder

614
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:51,640
actually took it upon himself, and built a whole entire retaining wall down below on our property.

615
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,920
So he built that wall, and he actually didn't even tell us because it was my birthday. We were

616
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:59,160
on vacation, so he said he didn't want to bother us with it. So yeah, when we came back and used

617
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:05,800
the jet ski the third time, we got a complaint, and even though there was a retaining wall there,

618
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:10,280
someone wanted to complain and say something anyways. Which I understand, like it's still

619
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:14,600
the matter of the fact, but it's still my property that the water is going down on. But to be honest

620
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:21,000
with you, if that were me, I would be so upset. Like if someone was putting anything on my property,

621
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,480
like it doesn't even matter if it's water. So you don't want anything on your property. If I had a

622
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:31,640
garden, or you know, like a garden of grapes, or like trees and stuff, like I wouldn't want anything

623
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,880
on my property. So I completely understand, like if anyone were to be upset. But again, you know,

624
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:40,760
there is that retaining wall that's there. But either way, I want the jet ski out.

625
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:45,080
It kind of sucks that she didn't actually apologize. Sorry really does seem to be the

626
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:49,480
hardest word for this family, but it could be worse. She does at least empathize with the people

627
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:54,360
making the complaints. Then there's this recorded confrontation with Austin, which honestly

628
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:58,600
feels kind of forced, but you know, at least they took action. Though I guess it would have been

629
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:03,160
nice to see more of a personal acknowledgement from Austin, given that it was his antics on the

630
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:15,480
jet ski that caused this trouble. Austin, how the hell did you get out of the pool? That jet ski is

631
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:20,040
so heavy. How do you think it got in the pool? Me, and like four of my friends.

632
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:32,040
You did not have people carried out of the pool. I did. To where? Where is it? Commenters stated

633
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:37,080
how they felt Austin came across as rather rude and inconsiderate. As said, I hope it's fake,

634
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:41,240
but it also seems dark that once again, he purposely missed out on the opportunity to be

635
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:46,200
a bit more mature and take some responsibility. Maybe I'd be a bit annoyed too if I thought my

636
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:50,840
partner had sold one of my items, but equally he was behaving so recklessly on it, and there was

637
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:56,200
no use for it either. It's hard to really blame anyone but yourself. For the record, Catherine

638
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:00,840
didn't actually sell it, she just put it in the garage. Although this issue is resolved, you don't

639
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:05,400
really receive the impression that Austin has grown from the situation, and I think the idea of

640
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:10,440
personal growth is important to the issue at hand, especially with a young or sensitive audience.

641
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:15,240
Now fortunately, Catherine's framing kind of shows Austin in the situation for the juvenile

642
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:20,040
individual that he is, but he's often the one at the helm, and he's the one with control over the

643
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:25,640
narrative, which as we've shown, isn't always the best decision. Austin comes across as a bit

644
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:31,560
immature, and the jet ski situation shows him as a big kid who loves his toys a little too much.

645
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:36,200
He often seems to lack thought about how his actions affect others, and that's not a good

646
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:40,600
thing for a creator his size. I think it'd be good for him to sometimes take a step back and

647
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:45,400
look at the implications beyond his immediate family. With an impressionable audience,

648
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,320
you're missing out on that opportunity.

649
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:56,120
The public eye is a cruel mistress. It's true, it kinda sucks we focus on the negative rather

650
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:00,920
than the positive, but by focusing on themselves as victims of the haters, they are doing exactly

651
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:06,040
the same. The Ace Family still have millions of loyal subscribers who like and watch every

652
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:11,720
single video they put out. Even at the peak of all the drama, they have completely persisted

653
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:17,560
as creators in the spotlight with overwhelmingly positive like to dislike ratios, which I know

654
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:22,840
doesn't mean everything, but they say enough about the strength of the Ace Family members.

655
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:27,160
Does that mean that as public figures they don't have problems? No, not at all. In fact,

656
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:31,000
the public eye can give you a lot of problems, but it doesn't mean those problems are sourced

657
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,240
in criticisms that have yielded from public behaviour which to many people is fair enough

658
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:40,440
to criticise. I think the Ace Family understand that, to be honest, because they do acknowledge

659
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:45,560
it, but they try to link it back to public criticism in an attempt to deflect it. Deep down,

660
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:49,880
the real problems with the public eye are, as always, how it can affect the personal,

661
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:54,920
private lives of individuals, which has always been a problem for anyone with celebrity status,

662
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:59,240
especially rumours of what's personally going on behind the scenes, and how the gossip can

663
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:03,880
spread. This is something the Ace Family has been subjected to as well, and once again,

664
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:08,520
that's the problem with family vlogs. I genuinely believe that vlogging your life in the way that

665
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:13,640
the Ace Family does put your family at risk. We spoke about Austin's relationship with Catherine,

666
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:17,960
but for the Family, it's a huge selling point. On Twitter, they only follow each other,

667
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:22,840
and they publicly indulge in a lot of romantic behaviour and market it to their audience.

668
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:27,080
However, in spite of this, many have become suspicious that it's a bit of an act,

669
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:32,520
many relating to other reported behaviours from family members, mostly Austin. One of the prominent

670
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:37,640
personal narratives is the one regarding Austin McBrun's faithfulness to his wife Catherine.

671
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:41,960
There are a lot of individuals who have claimed that Austin's antics extend to other women,

672
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:46,600
thus yielding to a narrative regarding infidelity that a lot of people believe. There have been a few

673
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,680
videos and posts that have accused him of this. One that received a significant amount of coverage

674
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:55,800
was a post by Belluck Gurr, who in posting an Instagram message she sent to Catherine on

675
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:00,200
Twitter, stated that while Austin was in Miami for the weekend, he slept with one of her friends,

676
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:04,840
and then made her sign an NDA. The author of this message said they couldn't stand quietly and let

677
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:10,120
this happen, and wanted to let her know as a mother and a woman. She also posted an additional reply

678
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:14,840
saying that she had all the proof and screenshots, and would only talk to Catherine. Catherine did

679
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:19,400
see this, and she snapped back, saying that if there was evidence she wanted to see it,

680
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:24,280
and if they were at risk of being sued due to an NDA, then she would pay for it out of her own

681
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:29,960
pockets. There were no further public interactions in this exchange. And honestly, it's hard to really

682
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:35,080
prove anything either way. There are a lot of claims about Austin's infidelity. Some had

683
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:39,320
suggested that the person sending this message couldn't have been watching since Elle was still

684
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:44,520
in the belly as their first video was the Q&A after Elle was born. However, as we know, looking

685
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:49,640
at the social blade, it seemed there may have been videos before the first upload, so unfortunately

686
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:54,200
that was a bit of a dead end. There were some additional conversations, and possible proof,

687
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:59,240
but honestly it was not concrete at all, it was pretty flimsy, and therefore the situation just

688
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:03,320
tailed off. Don't get me wrong, there are a significant amount of people who believe they've

689
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:08,280
seen Austin cheating, you can't ignore that, but this is the sort of thing that would undeniably

690
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:13,080
put stress on individuals within families, and a lot of it comes from the simultaneous popularity

691
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:17,240
and unpopularity of Austin. There are various videos out there that quote,

692
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:23,160
prove that he's cheating, and once again, it's really hard to ascertain what the truth is.

693
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:29,560
All right, so it's really hard to make out, but this is Austin right here, so we'll just try to

694
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:37,640
like slow it down somehow. So I think it's this girl right here, if you look really carefully.

695
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:50,920
Alrighty, honestly it's hard to ignore the general case of cheating, given the amount of claims,

696
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:56,120
but the number of people reaching to try and get a slice of the pie is just nauseating to follow.

697
00:58:56,120 --> 00:59:00,760
This eventually boiled over with probably the strongest allegations of them all,

698
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:05,720
alluding to sexual assault. Published by YouTube by the name of Cole Carrigan, he uploaded a video

699
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:10,360
called The Truth About The Ace Family, which is a 15 minute video detailing and promoting these

700
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,960
allegations against him.

701
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:17,640
So I know a lot of you guys are probably thinking, what does Cole Carrigan have to do with the Ace Family?

702
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:22,280
Why is he inserting himself in something that has nothing to do with him? He should just become a

703
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:27,960
drama channel at this point. Whenever it involves people that I love, I don't care who you are,

704
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:33,080
I will speak what I want to speak, and if I have facts to speak, it will be said.

705
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:37,080
In the video, he states how he came to the conclusion that he needs to come forward regarding this.

706
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:41,400
He states that people have been threatened with lawsuits, and that he's not afraid to talk about it

707
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:46,200
because he hasn't signed an NDA. He talks about how Keemstar had reached out to him and called him,

708
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:50,920
before subsequently turning down the story because he took a 500k bribe from the Ace Family.

709
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:55,400
We kind of just stayed low because we saw a bunch of tweets about people already knowing that he was

710
00:59:55,400 --> 01:00:00,760
uploading a video the next day about the situation, so we kind of were just like not worried, and we

711
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:06,440
were just gonna kind of let it unfold that way so we didn't have to insert ourselves where it wasn't

712
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:12,040
needed. The next day came and he didn't tweet anything, he didn't upload anything, so I texted

713
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:18,200
him saying how much did they pay you to keep quiet, and he responded with this, and I was

714
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:23,400
completely shocked. I immediately called my friend and told her that he was paid off $500,000 to keep

715
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:28,920
quiet about the situation, and that I needed to come forward. He then spoke about the situation,

716
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:33,880
he notes that there are NDAs involved, but that would be nullified in instances of rape, and that

717
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:39,240
this situation is now more important than that. So obviously my tweet got a lot of attention,

718
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:44,760
and someone from Austin Mcbruden's team actually texted my friend that this happened to,

719
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:50,680
I'll put the screenshot right here, basically saying that we should be careful and shouldn't

720
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:58,760
go any farther than what we're already doing to avoid legal action, and I proceeded to tell her

721
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:03,400
they're just trying to scare you, I just went through these exact same things, so I'm not scared.

722
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:08,120
I also didn't sign an NDA, and I also don't tolerate the shit that has happened to my friend.

723
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:13,320
So with that being said, I told her to ignore that message, because what needs to be said is going to

724
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:18,280
be said regardless, and if I need to say it, I'll do it, because I didn't sign an NDA, come arrest me.

725
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:23,560
So the story is that basically Austin approved a set of girls to come down and see him. They convened

726
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:29,000
in Miami around the 21st of July for an event, Austin went with his dad, Cole then provides

727
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,800
corroborating screenshots to show circumstantial evidence for the environment that preceded this

728
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:40,440
event, and then he goes into the details of the sexual assault. Disclaimer, this following clip will not be pleasant.

729
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:46,760
After they all had been drinking, my two friends went back to their room to go change because the sun was setting,

730
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:54,920
and that's when Austin, the security guard, the father, and two other guys came into their room.

731
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:59,640
Obviously, I don't have recordings that went down in the room, but my friend told me that

732
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:07,720
she repeatedly said no multiple times, over and over and over, to the point where she started crying,

733
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:14,280
begging them to stop. That's when they forced themselves in her, and I will insert the photos

734
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:21,960
of the blood all over the bedsheets in the hotel room right here on the exact same date, June 22nd.

735
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:27,560
There are many more details, but I'd recommend watching the video if you're interested, it's strong stuff for sure.

736
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:32,520
He continues to show evidence of a conversation that followed, the felt provided more substantiation

737
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:37,400
to the environment that played into this, before having this friend who is the victim come on the phone

738
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:42,280
for an anonymous testimony. This testimony doesn't provide too much more, bar the detail.

739
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:47,880
If you want that, then I'd recommend you go listen. Ultimately, Cole concludes that this is enough evidence

740
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:52,760
to prove, beyond doubt, that Austin McBroom is not just a cheat, but a rapist, and someone who does not

741
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,160
deserve to be in such a position of power.

742
01:02:55,160 --> 01:03:00,920
Okay, so now that you literally have the point of view from somebody who was actually there,

743
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:08,040
that is enough proof, and I really don't need to provide anything else for you to see that Austin, his dad,

744
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:17,000
his whole security team are pieces of shit, and these are not people that should be given all this

745
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:24,840
crazy amount of success. I can't live with knowing that this type of person who's doing these things to people

746
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:32,440
is just like, winning at life, literally having everything just handed to them, money, fame, dah dah dah dah.

747
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:38,040
This was a huge problem for the Ace Family, with the public eye on them, it felt like everything was on the edge

748
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:44,680
of imploding, but what was going on behind the scenes wasn't quite as cut and dry as it seemed.

749
01:03:47,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I hate knowing that something this serious could put an end to the Ace Family, or such a loved group of people,

750
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:08,040
like I don't want to be that person, that's not what I'm here to do, I don't want to split up a family,

751
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:14,200
I don't want to end relationships, because I've been getting a lot of messages like that,

752
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:19,560
oh why don't you stay quiet, why are you trying to ruin or end this family, it's not about that,

753
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:24,360
like that's the last thing I want to do is rip someone's family apart or anything, but whenever

754
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:32,120
something this serious happens and it's to my friend and multiple other people are coming forward about

755
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:38,040
other experiences, it's just not something that I as a person can stay quiet on, it's just against my

756
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:43,720
morals and it's something I absolutely won't do, so that's why I am here making this video for them.

757
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:49,880
Wow, how honourable Cole. The video in question is hard hitting and powerful, and for a while the momentum

758
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:54,920
seemed solidly in Cole's favour, however the ties began to turn when additional details came out,

759
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:59,560
particularly regarding the claims he had made about Keemstar. Obviously, as we know in his video,

760
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:04,840
Cole claimed Keemstar was paid $500,000 not to cover the drama, but this was refuted pretty quickly

761
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:09,160
by Keemstar himself as he posted screenshots which showed he had followed up on his message by

762
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:13,880
clarifying he was being sarcastic. On top of this, logically speaking, there was no way that Keemstar

763
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:18,840
would have admitted something like that seriously and just casually in a DM like that, as it would

764
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:24,120
threaten his brand, given how much money it is likely Keemstar has already, I'm not sure $500k

765
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:29,400
would make a huge difference, and therefore this alternative story about sarcasm makes much more sense.

766
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:34,360
Cole's Dad- Frankly, you've been very adamant on Twitter that you are going to ruin the Ace family,

767
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:38,680
so if they did pay me off $500k, why would I tell you?

768
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:43,000
It doesn't reflect well on Cole, because it's a simple fact. If he's prepared to lie about this,

769
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,760
then what else was he prepared to lie about? It means later the other girl who was referenced in

770
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:50,920
the video comes forward with her own testimony. She doesn't say too much, but she says she felt

771
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:54,600
the video was not released for the right reasons, and that Cole had approached her under the

772
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:59,240
precipice that he thought they could make a lot of money off this. These DMs brought forward by

773
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:04,920
this other victim showed Cole not actually being concerned for the justice of victims, but showing

774
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:11,000
more concern in how much money it could make them. So I'm sure they would want to pay me $100k or more,

775
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:16,840
not to say shit, and then I could split that with you guys if you help me and send me all the receipts

776
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:21,000
that I need. With this additional information, McVroom jumped in, showing these DMs, and also

777
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,400
stating that he would be pursuing legal action. Although Cole has stated that he does not feel

778
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:29,080
that they are following through on that threat, he has also admitted that his intentions were not

779
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:34,040
pure at the start, but now he realises that the fight for justice must persist, and has found a

780
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:39,560
new reason, and I just hate this all. There were some additional tweets and allegations that were

781
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:44,680
just terrible, this set of screenshots were proven completely fake, really depressing. Catherine

782
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:49,560
responded too, but it was with this weird DM which I wasn't even sure was in the video, and I'm not

783
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:54,040
sure how it tied into the allegations, so I was confused about that. Oh, and one more thing, this

784
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:58,200
garbage tweet which implied that because he had made multiple statements about involving his lawyers,

785
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:03,560
it applied some kind of guilt. I don't think that's how it works, I think Austin has an ego,

786
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:08,520
I think he wants to make people who he feels accused him wrongly suffer, and I think that will

787
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:13,000
follow through. I think if this does go to court, you'll understand why he acquired lawyers. As a

788
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,160
quick side note, I thought it was really terrible also how people claimed the one of the girls was

789
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:22,600
paid off because she said Austin McVroom was not at fault. You know the sort of believe victims

790
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:27,320
parenthesis when they agree with me narrative that I find absolutely vulgar. Most of the people

791
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:31,960
involved in this situation are fundamentally unlikable, and I don't think many of the audiences

792
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:38,200
are equipped to handle this either. Trial by Tarot cards is a new one, I admit. I'd also like to add

793
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:43,160
that the girl has since deleted these statements from her Instagram but stands by them, understandably

794
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:48,040
she didn't want it to be a persistent aspect of her life. It's hard to say exactly what happened,

795
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:53,160
but I'm not going to dismiss experiences as people being paid off. It has become a bit of an

796
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:58,120
obsessive narrative, even on Keemstar's video where he shows the context to the DM, there are

797
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:03,880
people claiming he was paid off too. One person even said, watch Cole Carrigan's video as proof

798
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:09,160
despite that video. It's a mess, and people are projecting preconceived opinions to dictate their

799
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:13,400
position on something much more complicated. It's not impossible that someone's been paid

800
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:18,360
off somewhere, but on the other hand, being able to expose someone as paying you off could be just

801
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:23,480
as profitable in the online age, so people would be very cautious in offering individuals payments

802
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:28,920
themselves. In spite of all this, I just feel bad for the daughters involved. But what about the

803
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:33,560
children cliche, I'm aware, but these are the controversies that are gonna make people's lives

804
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:38,280
a misery because people are taking a family life and turning it into a game of clout, and those

805
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:43,320
children didn't consent to that. This new drama is the point where it becomes destructive, I don't

806
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:47,720
know fully whose fault that is, but the fact that Cole can sit there and say he doesn't want to tear

807
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:52,440
a family apart but then make that video, extremely disingenuous. Austin has clearly been up to

808
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:57,480
something too, the extent of it I'm not sure, but he needs to be more cautious. He's a huge creator

809
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:02,520
now, congratulations, you live a lavish life, but you still have a family. This is the sort of stuff

810
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:07,000
that will harm a relationship even if your partner believes you, and the worrying thought is that

811
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,560
doubt that people are just staying together for the sake of the YouTube channel, that's not healthy

812
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:15,560
either. Families are meant to be natural, they're meant to exist because you want them to exist.

813
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:20,440
If you can film that family life and make a quick buck then I'm not one to stand in your way,

814
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:25,400
but the prime aim of a family is to surround yourself with people you love and provide a healthy

815
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:29,880
environment to children who are going to be the next generation, and you want to provide them with

816
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:34,840
the principles that they stand by. Austin and Catherine obviously didn't ask for these allegations,

817
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:39,160
but people's negative judgement towards the Ace Family has been a result of a consistent failure

818
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:43,800
to empathise with other people, and so when the Ace Family needed empathy of their own, they didn't

819
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:48,600
get it. My empathy is free, I think it's shit that if false these allegations have surfaced in such

820
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:54,520
a way, pushed by an agenda hungry toxic individual who should be nowhere near dealing with cases,

821
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:59,240
as sensitive as this, but look at the controversies we've spoken about today, and ask yourself how can

822
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:04,440
you make audiences see your perspective more clearly. The Ace Family kinda suck, they seem fake,

823
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:08,040
they often seem entitled to think they're above criticism because of the good deeds they've done

824
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:12,280
which trivialises those good deeds, they lack empathy for others and yet try to manipulate it

825
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:16,760
out of their audiences through incidents or truth style documentaries, and generally they,

826
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:21,640
mostly Austin, seem to be ill-equipped to be role models to viewers, both adults and children.

827
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:25,400
This has built up a lot of contempt in critics because they've acquired this position of power

828
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:29,480
while not being particularly responsible, and so when these more serious allegations surfaced,

829
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:34,040
paired with the assumption that many people have that Austin is a cheat, people immediately wanted

830
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:38,600
to see the back of them, people wanted to take them down. I personally treat these allegations

831
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:43,800
with caution, given that it already seems muddy and the mix of vested interests

832
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:49,480
really doesn't reassure me. If it's real, then once again, terribly handled, and it should've been

833
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:54,360
kept out of someone like Cole's hands, I think most of the hatred towards them is an outcome of

834
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:58,920
them just constantly pissing off people, and although it is people's responsibility to not

835
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:03,320
be as presumptuous, it's incredible once again how quickly people have jumped to a conclusion,

836
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:08,120
I feel like it's a risk when you constantly shun people who criticise you, you're going to create

837
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:14,120
tension which in this instance, snapped. Let us move on to our conclusion from this lengthy saga.

838
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:26,600
The Ace Family seem to involve themselves in much more drama than a lot of YouTube families,

839
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:31,000
and they go this midway between responding to criticism and just straight up deflecting it or

840
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,160
victimising themselves, and they never seem to work out the simplest way to respond, either

841
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:40,200
because of ignorance or ego, probably both to a certain extent. Austin seems to be the worst

842
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:45,240
offender, he seems rather juvenile and reckless, he's basically Roman Atwood trying to be Jake

843
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:49,480
Paul, and Jake Paul shouldn't be a dad, he's already exploiting enough children as it is.

844
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:54,040
Catherine, although being somewhat more reserved, seems to at least be complicit in a lot of these

845
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:59,240
stunts and manipulative in many ways, often rationalising the behaviour and dodging the

846
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:04,360
criticism equally. Some people have accused her of being a gold digger, but no, it's kinda sexist

847
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:09,080
as it underplays her role in the actual channel, they're a couple, they are both beneficiaries of

848
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:12,840
their own interaction with each other, which means that you can't tell if there's something

849
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:17,800
really wrong because you really only see what they want you to see. It leads to fundamental doubts in

850
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:22,120
the authenticity of the relationship, it doesn't mean that those doubts are correct, but you can

851
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:26,200
see where they come from. They both kind of contribute to this mess that we've gone through

852
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:31,240
today in their own unique way, and even though they have their supporters, they also have a lot

853
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:36,360
of enemies, and individuals who do not have the best experience with them. If the stupid subtweets,

854
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:41,560
angry Instagram rants, and publicity stunts didn't rub someone the wrong way, they'll find something

855
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:45,720
equally obnoxious that will. Do I think they're the worst? No. When you've had to experience

856
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:51,320
individuals like Daddy05, it puts it in perspective, they make a lot of people happy, and I can't deny

857
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:55,560
that, but they still behave in a way where people are gonna lose out. There are incidents that have

858
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:59,640
maybe questioned their intent, which is important when you're dealing with a larger young audience

859
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:04,120
who are prone to exploitation, and I haven't even spoken about every incident. They're promoting a

860
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:08,920
message to millions of people, and some are going to take issue with that, especially when it's poorly

861
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:14,120
delivered, it is inevitability. They can't be upset at that principle, they can be upset when people

862
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:19,960
falsely accuse stuff that might jeopardise the private life of individuals involved, and cause trust rifts

863
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:24,680
where they may not be warranted. As said, I can't tell you how much of what's been said is true,

864
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:29,640
but I'd probably be pretty upset too. Equally be aware that provided Cole's allegations are false,

865
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:34,280
it is probably a cause of crying wolf, their behaviour building up a negative perception so that

866
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:38,920
when something negative happened to them, people took the easiest explainable route. The point is

867
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:43,480
though, sometimes the wolf is actually there. It's important to remember that people who've been wrong

868
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:48,680
can be in the right, but it's also a case for why the Ace Family should try and build a better rapport

869
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:53,560
with their critics. Family channels are changing, Austin McBroom, the Ace Family, definitely seek to

870
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:58,200
pursue a different relationship with their audience, and on principle, I can respect that. However,

871
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:03,640
their conduct in other ways certainly hasn't been as high to a standard as many would hope, and the

872
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:08,600
standard does have to be kind of higher for a family channel, not just for the sake of the audience,

873
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:13,320
but for the children. I hope they really do feel involved with their channel because it's not something

874
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:17,400
you should force. Right now, the kids are really young, so they're unlikely to specifically remember

875
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:22,360
that much, but this sort of stuff can still really affect the development of a child. I hope they get

876
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:26,840
out of this drama-embroiled side of YouTube, and learn how to deal with the nature of controversy

877
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:30,520
a bit better. At the end of the day, people are still going to look up to them as role models,

878
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:35,240
they're still a monumentally sized channel, and they're still parents. I hope all innocents

879
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:39,720
prevailing, they have the chance to have that family life they sometimes claim to desire.

880
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:46,200
I've never thought about stopping, but I feel like if we... I've thought about it.

881
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:53,880
Really? Yeah. Really? I have.

882
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,640
That is, if they really want it.

883
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:03,720
So yes, that's the video. What a fun time we had here, it has been banging. Go and check out Jay

884
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:09,400
Aubrey, he is a darling, we love him so much on this channel. This is the first time he's actually

885
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:15,080
been on I think, and hopefully not the last. He's a great creator, and I can't endorse him enough,

886
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:19,240
most people probably know him at this stage, but hey, go and check him out if you haven't.

887
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:23,000
I also wanna give a shout out to the editors, once again a lot of editors on this one,

888
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,720
and they all got a deliver, and hopefully like the postman, they did. If they didn't, well...

889
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:30,040
There'll be rations in the dungeon for a few days.

890
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:41,560
I'd also like to give a big thank you to my Patreons, $10 Patreons are up on screen right now,

891
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:49,560
and big, big thank you to some hullabaloo Nico Deschamps and Caroline, $50 Patreons, thank you

892
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:55,400
so much, you're fantastic, I really appreciate it, and a very special thanks to my $100 Patreon,

893
01:15:55,400 --> 01:16:00,280
Brandon, fabulous, Brandon's been here for so long, you gotta love that, you love to see it,

894
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:05,800
I love to see it, thank you Brandon, you're the, you're the mother, you're the motherfucking G,

895
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:11,640
you're the G. My Twitter, at TheRightOpinion, you can reach me on there, I do respond to DMs there,

896
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:16,280
Facebook, I haven't responded to DMs for a while, I need to check that out, and Discord, links in

897
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:20,040
the pinned comment, you can go and check it out, I'm gonna try and be more active in all of it,

898
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:24,040
but it's all over the place because I'm all over the place, that's how I roll, you probably know

899
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:27,960
that by now, other than that I don't really have too much else to add, take care of yourselves

900
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:32,680
guys, hope you're having a good week, and I'm sending my love out to all of you.
