00:00.000 --> 00:13.860
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

00:13.860 --> 00:21.260
and families, my god, do I love families, whoop whoop whoop. Humor aside, the family is an important staple in the many

00:21.260 --> 00:26.880
societies that we do indeed live in. As a concept, it has been around for longer than I can remember, and although

00:26.880 --> 00:32.000
many of us do have various goals, there are many people who would just like to settle down with a partner who loves

00:32.000 --> 00:37.600
them and raise a few kids. It's a completely fair perspective, and one that I hope people have the opportunity to

00:37.600 --> 00:43.560
fulfil. It's definitely something that I would like to do at one point in my life, though I'm not entirely sure when.

00:43.560 --> 00:49.280
However, I think many of us have a very idealised version of how these things would play out, and although it often

00:49.280 --> 00:56.160
takes a few attempts to get it right, and a few more for some, and a few more for others, maybe a few more on top of

00:56.160 --> 01:02.140
that, it's still something we like to hold on to, which is where the idea of family vlogging comes into play.

01:02.140 --> 01:08.440
Vlogs appeal to the audience under the notion that they can represent a life that we may idolise and feel an affinity with,

01:08.440 --> 01:13.960
that's what has made so many of these wealthy vloggers famous from the start. However, it's important that these people

01:13.960 --> 01:19.240
can place themselves in the vloggers position, and that the life they envision can be channelled through a relatable

01:19.240 --> 01:25.440
individual. There was a time when a majority of audiences on YouTube liked to envision their lives as the sweet, wholesome

01:25.440 --> 01:31.360
ones that will one day be blessed with the same glorious tidings that so many of those lovely vloggers have earned

01:31.360 --> 01:37.440
themselves. However, at some point in the last few years, I've noticed a shift. I noted it in my Emma Chamberlain video,

01:37.440 --> 01:43.880
that hey, I guess people are feeling kinda cynical now, and I mean who can blame them, the world is a depressing place,

01:43.880 --> 01:50.440
and I guess everyone is just kind of in that mood, and out of that rose a new line up of stars who were slightly more

01:50.440 --> 01:56.600
controversial than the previous ones. There are positives and negatives to this, but at least it gives us something to talk

01:56.600 --> 02:03.840
about. Now, this didn't have to be particularly negative in a way, it just meant slightly more loud, obnoxious, and less subtle.

02:03.840 --> 02:07.240
We're gonna make her worst nightmare come true.

02:07.240 --> 02:13.160
This was a case in every genre, and eventually the penny dropped in the family genre too. You know, you don't have to pretend

02:13.160 --> 02:20.040
that everything's perfect, how about conflict and storm? People love melodrama, you just need energy, some ideas,

02:20.040 --> 02:27.040
a bit of money, and of course, a partner and a kid. I mean, hey, they can't be too hard to find, especially if you're as dashing

02:27.040 --> 02:29.520
as the man known as Austin McBroom.

02:29.520 --> 02:35.680
Austin McBroom- I enjoy catching the ball, I enjoy just having a blast with the teammates on the field and off the field.

02:35.680 --> 02:42.880
Oh yeah. Austin McBroom is the husband and father of the Ace family, now he is an individual who is obviously known

02:42.880 --> 02:49.280
primarily on YouTube. However, at one point, it seemed his career was not destined there, as that clip showed he was a very

02:49.320 --> 02:55.560
sporting-oriented individual, and was highly rated in the basketball scene, and to be fair, the dude had some moves,

02:55.560 --> 03:01.760
he could shoot some hoops. Given his prominence, you could say he was kinda a low-key media figure, he had a previously

03:01.760 --> 03:08.160
established audience due to his skills, and here's an old screenshot of his 2015 twitter long before the launch of his

03:08.160 --> 03:15.160
YouTube channel, which had his three principles listed in his biography, one god, two family, three hoop.

03:15.400 --> 03:21.440
A simple set of beliefs that had guided him to relative success in the basketball scene, and a tendency to write

03:21.440 --> 03:27.240
inspirational tweets. One of the elements that was very noticeable on his twitter prior to the creation of his channel

03:27.240 --> 03:33.120
was the love of his fiance Catherine. They had a fairly standard story behind them, they saw each other a couple times,

03:33.120 --> 03:39.080
and then decided that actually they had feelings which led them to initiating this relationship and the subsequent birthing

03:39.080 --> 03:44.480
of their daughter Elle. The run-up to their child had a fair bit of coverage on twitter, and a nice bit of hype

03:44.480 --> 03:50.040
surrounding it, so I guess at that point they decided that their life was interesting enough to start a YouTube channel.

03:50.040 --> 03:58.120
Hey guys, welcome to our YouTube channel, this is our first Q&A, you guys sent us a bunch of questions that we picked out.

03:58.120 --> 04:03.760
Now, when I looked at their old content, and I saw that their first video was a Q&A, I thought they were pulling my leg,

04:03.760 --> 04:09.240
that's some bullsey confidence in your character to open your channel with a Q&A video. Now, from looking at an old

04:09.240 --> 04:14.440
social blade screenshot, it's possible that they had some other videos up, but deleted them before launch,

04:14.440 --> 04:19.480
so I guess they just used the already existent clout that they had surrounding Austin's basketball career,

04:19.480 --> 04:25.040
and his relationship to launch the channel. They originally were called the incredible name of Austin and Catherine Vlogs,

04:25.040 --> 04:31.520
before changing it to the Ace family, Ace representing the initials of each family member's name, Austin, Catherine, and Elle.

04:31.520 --> 04:36.960
They do have another child now, Elle, but I guess the Ace family didn't quite have the same ring to it.

04:36.960 --> 04:43.400
They started off on a fair wave of momentum, and have since built on that, accumulating over 17 million subscribers,

04:43.400 --> 04:49.360
in the space of three and a half years. So what's the big deal? Family vlogs are here to stay.

04:49.360 --> 04:56.000
Well, although vloggers have always taken on their fair share of drama, there seems to be something more about the Ace family,

04:56.040 --> 05:03.040
and even more specifically, the man of the house, Austin McBroom, in that he may not be practicing what he preaches,

05:03.040 --> 05:06.840
and treating those around him with the respect that may be expected.

05:06.840 --> 05:10.640
After all, this family is a family who's very grateful.

05:10.640 --> 05:17.440
Austin McBroom- Living life to the fullest, like we're keeping God first, being good people, and just trying our best to inspire others.

05:18.440 --> 05:25.800
We're doing our best, as far as using our platform in order to do greater things, and inspire people,

05:25.800 --> 05:31.200
and that's really how we feel every single day, and like, we just get so excited to do things for people,

05:31.200 --> 05:35.400
and if you can't already tell, like, that's just in our nature, and that's what we love to do.

05:35.400 --> 05:41.760
A family grateful for many things, but sometimes more than words is necessary to convince people that you believe it,

05:41.800 --> 05:49.520
and that is what has been in question over the last couple years, ultimately climaxing in a situation very recently involving much more serious claims,

05:49.520 --> 05:52.800
although I have a lot to say about the validity of those.

05:52.800 --> 05:58.720
This is not going to be just about Austin, in fact, Catherine is probably going to be receiving a fair bit of scrutiny as well,

05:58.720 --> 06:02.520
so don't worry, everyone's going to receive their fair share of discourse.

06:02.520 --> 06:07.720
Let's have a discussion to see if the Ace family are really as ace as they've proclaimed to be,

06:07.720 --> 06:12.120
or if behind the candelabra, they're not quite the role models that many see them as.

06:12.120 --> 06:15.960
Well, fellas, I'm ready to get up and do my thing, I wanna get into it, man, you know?

06:15.960 --> 06:22.200
And yes, that was a James Brown reference, because, well, I'm a sex machine. Let's go.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.520
I want to start off this part with a quick disclaimer.

06:27.520 --> 06:33.640
If there's one red flag that will immediately make me question a creator's desire to produce realistic organic content,

06:33.680 --> 06:34.840
it's the notion of pranks.

06:34.840 --> 06:38.800
Now, of course, not just any pranks, I'm sure there are some great pranks out there,

06:38.800 --> 06:45.800
but you know, that brand of prank that I'm talking about, Roman Atwood, FouseyTube, Joey Salads, Prank Invasion, all that jazz.

06:45.800 --> 06:50.000
The reason that I make this statement is because for many of you YouTube veterans,

06:50.000 --> 06:52.960
you will know that these pranks were all blatantly fake.

06:52.960 --> 06:59.920
The reason for making these pranks fake was because there was never a standard presented by an audience that we'd expect them to make the content genuine.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.720
People valued the stunt over the sentiment behind it.

07:02.720 --> 07:06.560
On top of this, the fakeness ensured the safety of the individual involved,

07:06.560 --> 07:12.040
particularly when they partook in inflammatory stunts which may cause emotional harm to another individual.

07:12.040 --> 07:15.680
Now, honestly, the Ace Family were probably far from the worst in this area,

07:15.680 --> 07:19.600
and the topics that they faked probably didn't have many social repercussions,

07:19.600 --> 07:22.880
but when I found out that a lot of their most viewed videos were pranks,

07:22.880 --> 07:27.720
and seeing it as how they kicked off their channel, I started to become a bit concerned.

07:27.720 --> 07:30.320
I don't have much confidence in these channels because honestly,

07:30.320 --> 07:35.880
I believe that any channel prepared to sell an audience's pranks won't shy away from selling the audience anything else.

07:35.880 --> 07:40.640
However, it is a case of positive proof, and I am a judgmental person in this instance,

07:40.640 --> 07:45.000
but my first impressions of the family were not optimistic to say the least.

07:45.000 --> 07:51.800
One of my concerns with channels that fake these things is that they don't really have much concern for their actual relationship with their audience,

07:51.800 --> 07:58.480
and only care about how the audience sees them, which allows them to partake in exploitive behaviours that the audience overlooks.

07:58.480 --> 08:03.560
This is one of the running criticisms when I was accumulating a list of topics that were on the chopping board today,

08:03.560 --> 08:07.960
that they pretend to care, and actually just exploit the relationship whenever they can,

08:07.960 --> 08:12.480
which is a pretty cynical perspective, but once again, to fulfil such a claim, we need proof.

08:12.480 --> 08:17.160
Let's talk about the incidents that have drawn this criticism, starting with their charity work.

08:17.160 --> 08:24.440
To many audiences, charity work seems like an unmitigated positive, those who engage in charitable behaviour are often praised,

08:24.480 --> 08:32.520
and rightly so. However, for the very cynical people, they may see charity as a phony way for a creator to try and gain reputation points,

08:32.520 --> 08:36.160
which may lead to more negative exploitation in the future.

08:36.160 --> 08:41.880
Now generally, I don't like to side with the latter perspective, because these sorts of things, even if they're stunts,

08:41.880 --> 08:51.160
can bring a lot of positive attention to good causes, but I also have to note as a premise that doing charity work does not make you an inherently good or trustworthy person,

08:51.160 --> 08:54.200
which is where we look at the Ace Family's charity work.

08:54.200 --> 09:01.400
And lastly, to spice it up a little bit, the person I picked for the one-on-one competition, after he's done taking an L, we're gonna play five-on-five.

09:01.400 --> 09:09.000
He will pick his four other guys, and I will pick my four other guys, and the winner of that game will receive a $100,000 check to donate to charity.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.200
Each player on that team will get a portion of the money to donate to their charity of choice, and guys, that's the best part about this event,

09:14.200 --> 09:17.720
is to be able to give back. To us, there's nothing better in the world than to give back.

09:17.800 --> 09:25.080
The Ace Family love to give back, and so when they announced that they were hosting a charity basketball event in June 2018,

09:25.080 --> 09:34.360
obviously, in the spirit of Austin's game of choice, people were excited. As heard, the winner of the game would receive $100,000 to donate to charity,

09:34.360 --> 09:44.040
a very noble cause indeed. The event came around, it was a huge success, it seemed that people had a great time, and they even donated that $75,000?

09:44.120 --> 09:50.200
Alrighty then. This caught fairly immediate criticism, as it was not the amount they had originally pledged to donate.

09:50.200 --> 09:57.640
Many theorised that given the sales, they should have made over $500,000 from the event, but others argued that given the costs,

09:57.640 --> 10:04.680
it is possible that $75,000 was actually a reasonable amount to donate, and besides, $75,000 was better than nothing,

10:04.680 --> 10:11.240
any sort of discussion around how much they made is very grey, and so it's hard to tally up cost-profit margins.

10:11.240 --> 10:19.160
However, if I was in their shoes, given the money involved, if the donation fell short, I probably would have just filled in the remaining money myself,

10:19.160 --> 10:26.280
or at least tried to explain to my audience the situation. The closest they get to doing that is this clip from what I understand.

10:26.280 --> 10:32.600
They took $11 from each ticket for ambulances to be there on spot.

10:32.600 --> 10:38.280
But even then, the explanation is rather insufficient, as pointed out by epic YouTuber Pyrocynical.

10:38.280 --> 10:45.880
So let's take $11 off each ticket, but that's still a fraction of the possible profit he made compared to the money he gave away.

10:45.880 --> 10:52.360
Also, he might have even hired the stadium for a discounted price, or even for free, because this was a charity event.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.240
But I like money.

10:53.240 --> 10:59.160
And regardless, you want to honour your commitment to charity, they were selling merch at like $65 a piece at the event,

10:59.160 --> 11:06.440
and I feel they could have afforded it. I'm sure the money went to the right cause, I just sincerely hope they did donate every last cent,

11:06.440 --> 11:09.640
because the next few events may make you doubt that they did.

11:09.640 --> 11:16.360
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, well, shame on me, but still, significant amount of shame on you too.

11:16.360 --> 11:22.280
And once again, the source of the controversy came from a basketball event, involving $100,000.

11:22.280 --> 11:25.080
I mean, it's like they're baiting their audience at this point.

11:25.080 --> 11:30.360
So in this video, Oster announces he's doing another giveaway, this time actually $100,000,

11:30.360 --> 11:35.320
and he'll be giving it to anyone who can shoot 10 consecutive hoops in a basketball competition.

11:35.320 --> 11:39.240
It sounds pretty easy to me. If you think you can do it, hit us up.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.840
If you think your favourite YouTuber or celebrity can do it, make sure you tag them.

11:42.840 --> 11:45.880
I also put the video on my Instagram, so make sure you tag them in the comments.

11:45.880 --> 11:48.920
Guys, it's a free $100,000, you don't have to pay to enter.

11:48.920 --> 11:56.520
Although, we suggest, it's up to you, but we suggest whoever wins, donates a portion to charity.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.600
You all know, Catherine, I love giving back.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.640
Now, given the rather general language, him talking about YouTubes,

12:01.640 --> 12:06.040
but also talking about anyone who thinks they're good enough, in both his video and his announcement tweet,

12:06.040 --> 12:09.560
you'd expect this competition to be open to anyone, right? Wrong.

12:09.560 --> 12:15.240
Austin just listed 20 already fairly wealthy individuals who definitely weren't just randomly selected.

12:15.240 --> 12:18.360
It kinda sucked, and to add insult to injury during the competition,

12:18.360 --> 12:23.160
he invites one of his other basketball playing friends down who wasn't even on the original list to play,

12:23.160 --> 12:27.800
and that guy wins it. $100,000, which once again, doesn't mean much to anyone.

12:27.800 --> 12:30.760
People were fairly annoyed, because they did feel misled,

12:30.760 --> 12:34.120
not because he actively stated that he was going to be inviting his fans,

12:34.120 --> 12:39.560
but because he has shown in the past that he is completely capable of clarifying when he only wants influencers,

12:39.560 --> 12:41.320
such as the last basketball game.

12:41.320 --> 12:45.560
What that means is, I am going to challenge anyone with a support system,

12:45.560 --> 12:53.320
whether that be a YouTuber, whether that be a celebrity, whether that be an artist, whether that be a baby.

12:53.320 --> 12:59.240
So basically, you want to play against someone who has a fan base, that can bring a fan base?

12:59.240 --> 12:59.960
Yes.

12:59.960 --> 13:01.320
Someone that has support?

13:01.320 --> 13:01.880
Yes.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.280
When he said the competition was open to people,

13:04.280 --> 13:09.320
people had the impression that he would be inviting anyone, thus imposing these false expectations.

13:09.320 --> 13:15.000
The only comment that could remotely be interpreted in the direction of saying it's more influence-focused is this one.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.360
So this is a new year. Everyone wants the new year to be better than the last year,

13:18.360 --> 13:22.360
so our first video in the new year was a video dedicated to all of our ace family members.

13:22.360 --> 13:26.120
So now we want to do something fun and entertaining for the social media world.

13:26.120 --> 13:32.040
After watching this around five times, I came to the conclusion that he was implying this would be focused away from the fans,

13:32.040 --> 13:38.040
but it was a vaguely delivered statement, and in the context of the whole video, you'd completely receive a different impression.

13:38.040 --> 13:42.120
Again, it's not a huge deal, it's just strange why he didn't seek to make it clearer,

13:42.120 --> 13:48.120
maybe because he thought it wouldn't be high enough stakes if everyone already knew that a rich person was winning 100,000?

13:48.120 --> 13:51.880
Maybe he's just bad at explaining things without Catherine there.

13:51.960 --> 13:56.280
Nonetheless, it's not a huge deal, he can quickly clear it up, right?

13:56.280 --> 14:04.280
I didn't expect to find any of Austin's response, but I did, and now I understand why he doesn't normally respond,

14:04.280 --> 14:09.800
because wow, that's a bad response. It's hard to work out exactly what he's saying here or the logic,

14:09.800 --> 14:14.440
but he basically seems insulted that people have a problem when he's done so much,

14:14.440 --> 14:20.360
and that if you're a true ace family member, you must appreciate everything else the mighty Austin McBroom does,

14:20.360 --> 14:22.600
and take no issue with his decisions.

14:22.600 --> 14:28.360
His other response was at the end of the charity video, to the criticism that everyone was rich, so they didn't need money.

14:28.360 --> 14:33.560
Man, it feels so good to like, cause a lot of people kept saying, yo, give it to someone who needs it,

14:33.560 --> 14:37.960
like they kept saying, everyone in the event, you know, makes a lot of money, so they don't need it.

14:37.960 --> 14:43.160
Guys, you don't know what people's situations are, so you don't know how much someone makes at all, right?

14:43.160 --> 14:48.600
But for someone who actually really needed it, I picked someone out of the stands that wasn't even in the contest,

14:48.600 --> 14:51.640
just because we really wanted to give it away, and I felt like he had a good shot.

14:51.640 --> 14:58.040
Next thing you know, he wins, okay? That's dope, that's such a cool story.

14:58.040 --> 14:59.640
Fair enough, I guess.

14:59.640 --> 15:03.800
Well, once again, the problem arose with the fact that this comment seemed purposely dishonest,

15:03.800 --> 15:11.320
as the winner, Austin Mills, is the son of Jade Mills, a luxury real estate agent who has over 5 billion in sales.

15:11.320 --> 15:15.720
Now, I cannot comment on a son's relationship with his ostensibly rich mother,

15:15.720 --> 15:19.400
but it definitely made McBroom's comments look a bit ridiculous.

15:19.400 --> 15:24.200
It's the Ace Family's channel, but the behaviour surrounding the stunt seemed insulting to the audience's

15:24.200 --> 15:30.360
intelligence, arrogant, and all around a bit mean-spirited, and for someone who's so humble and intent on giving back,

15:30.360 --> 15:34.920
you'd think he wouldn't react as if he was a god who felt people went praying enough to him.

15:34.920 --> 15:40.040
Why would it be so hard to apologise for a misunderstanding that seemed honestly purposely vague?

15:40.040 --> 15:42.200
I don't know, let's talk about it more.

15:45.720 --> 15:57.640
One of the things that I've noticed is that when being faced down with serious criticism,

15:57.640 --> 16:02.440
the Ace Family doesn't really like talking about it, and when they do, it's typically not with the most finesse.

16:02.440 --> 16:07.880
They have two options, they can respond, which we've partly observed already, or they can ignore and elicit sympathy

16:07.880 --> 16:14.680
through what may appear to be unrelated methods, but honestly, I'm not sure if they're as coincidental as one might assume.

16:14.680 --> 16:17.800
Let's begin with the former, how they act when they respond.

16:17.800 --> 16:21.880
I've already criticised them for their response to people's annoyance about the basketball game,

16:21.880 --> 16:27.160
which although not the biggest deal, did demonstrate a lack of competence, but there is another great situation

16:27.160 --> 16:30.840
which once again illuminates this, and probably a few more points as well.

16:30.840 --> 16:38.760
We've been getting a lot of comments lately, asking us what happened, what happened with the Ace Family

16:38.760 --> 16:47.800
in this truck, so we just wanted to address it, and let you guys hear first hand from our mouths, what really happened.

16:47.800 --> 16:53.720
This is one involving an individual by the name of Urban Trademark 7, he's a designer, he makes some pretty slick designs,

16:53.720 --> 16:56.040
and he felt that McBroom had ripped him off.

16:56.040 --> 17:02.360
I guess, you know, he came across the merchandise again and he bought a couple items, and he had asked Bobby like,

17:02.360 --> 17:08.680
yeah, do you know the dude that makes these, and Bobby, I guess, told him like, yeah, you know, I know him,

17:08.680 --> 17:15.080
but all his information is on the label, so if you wanna reach out to him, you know, that's Instagram,

17:15.080 --> 17:21.480
and all his contacts is on there, so he reached out from the text messages that I post, and I was like,

17:21.480 --> 17:25.880
for sure, let's link up and try to put something together then.

17:25.880 --> 17:30.520
To explain in a bit more depth, it appears that Austin had seen and purchased some of Urban's designs

17:30.520 --> 17:35.320
while out and about in local stores, and had asked after him. Apparently, he really liked the designs,

17:35.320 --> 17:40.040
and had fans who he felt would appreciate some merchandise made in the style of that content.

17:40.040 --> 17:46.280
So then from there, I was like, alright, well, what I can do is I can make a couple exclusively for you,

17:46.280 --> 17:51.160
and then we can sell them, and then, you know, when I link back up, I'll make them, when I link back up,

17:51.160 --> 17:52.760
we can negotiate like the price.

17:52.760 --> 17:57.480
So they decide to convene and discuss the prospects of working on some collaborative content.

17:57.480 --> 18:02.760
So it appears that they were going to work on some designs together before finalising the financial side of it.

18:02.760 --> 18:07.400
There's also something about a colouring book that I think Urban wanted McBroom to promote as well,

18:07.400 --> 18:11.720
one that he gifted to McBroom's daughter, although McBroom didn't want to take a picture with him,

18:11.720 --> 18:15.000
which he found suspicious due to disassociation in a way.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.320
So yeah, so I'm like, oh, I'm gonna give a... Intensely, I was just like, I'm gonna give a book to his daughter,

18:19.320 --> 18:24.360
cause I made the book for my daughter, that's what inspired me, and I'm like, he has a little one,

18:24.360 --> 18:26.840
so I want to give her a colouring book.

18:26.840 --> 18:33.240
So on my way out, when we got to the car, I give him the colouring book, and I'm like, hey, you know,

18:33.240 --> 18:37.800
this is for your daughter, you know, just give it to her if you can, you know, take a picture,

18:37.800 --> 18:40.280
you know, just trying to promote the book for kids.

18:40.280 --> 18:43.640
He was like, he was like, dope, that's for sure, I got you.

18:43.640 --> 18:46.200
And I was like, do you mind if I get a picture with you with the book?

18:46.200 --> 18:51.880
He instantly like froze up for a second, was like, nah, nah, let's just wait, man, I only take professional pictures.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.320
And I was like, all right, for sure.

18:53.320 --> 18:57.720
The conversation continued over the following days, with Urban presenting the designs to McBroom,

18:57.720 --> 18:59.880
who said he'd been busy. What was he busy with?

18:59.880 --> 19:03.880
Well, allegedly copping Urban's own designs, and then selling them himself,

19:03.880 --> 19:09.400
even one regarding an ice cream truck that the Ace Family allegedly nabbed for one of their subscriber specials

19:09.400 --> 19:11.000
just under a year later.

19:11.000 --> 19:17.800
And then a couple days later, I seen on YouTube, he had on the band, some bands that looked like my bands,

19:17.800 --> 19:19.000
with him and his daughter.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.360
They was mad thicc.

19:20.360 --> 19:23.320
They was mad thicc, they wasn't, I just know my work.

19:23.320 --> 19:27.160
And I was like, I was like, Lika, come here, look at this.

19:27.160 --> 19:29.880
And she's like, nah, nah, nah.

19:29.880 --> 19:34.760
And then, so then I basically, that's what you see from the text, I hit him up.

19:34.760 --> 19:37.560
I'm like, bro, what's up with this?

19:37.560 --> 19:43.000
Those messages when we were put here is basically what inspired, you know, transpired.

19:43.000 --> 19:43.880
People do that, man.

19:43.880 --> 19:52.040
People get really influenced and rip you off so fast that I'm not the only one that's been done too, I'm pretty sure.

19:52.040 --> 19:56.920
But, so I kind of like, I took it with a grain of salt.

19:56.920 --> 20:01.080
Another thing was dope is I'm working on a truck that I'm about to drop,

20:01.080 --> 20:07.720
that we can like basically do pop-ups where every band that I make exclusively for you,

20:07.720 --> 20:12.040
we pop up, we could sell them, and then, you know, it's love.

20:12.040 --> 20:15.960
So I tell him the whole get down about the truck and how I used to have a store,

20:15.960 --> 20:18.040
and now I feel like mobile is the new wave.

20:18.680 --> 20:22.440
And like, you know, and he's like, oh man, that shit is like, that shit sound genius.

20:22.440 --> 20:23.720
I felt some type of way.

20:24.360 --> 20:30.600
And that's when I was like, oh, nah, I gotta, I gotta expose this dude because, you know,

20:30.600 --> 20:35.480
and then when it's crazy, because when I posted about the truck, people was hitting me up mad DMs,

20:35.480 --> 20:38.120
like, you're not the only one he ripped off.

20:38.120 --> 20:41.080
They had a subsequent confrontation and Instagram DMs,

20:41.080 --> 20:44.120
and Urban felt provoked eventually into making a video

20:44.120 --> 20:47.320
with the publication of this ice cream truck instant.

20:47.320 --> 20:50.840
It's hard to exactly measure the verifiability of these claims.

20:50.840 --> 20:55.320
It appears that a lot of what was said was true about the circumstances surrounding it.

20:55.320 --> 20:58.440
The difficulties come into the fact that it's difficult to exactly argue

20:58.440 --> 21:03.240
how much was plagiarized in a way and how much McBroom just decided to do in his own style.

21:03.240 --> 21:07.320
But regardless, it's a shame they couldn't communicate these differences more effectively.

21:07.320 --> 21:10.440
And the whole ice cream truck scenario is a bit suspicious,

21:10.440 --> 21:13.720
though because the vagueness in the language in the DMs that I've seen,

21:13.720 --> 21:16.760
it's difficult to once again say exactly what's gone on.

21:16.760 --> 21:18.680
No one really admits to much.

21:18.680 --> 21:21.240
However, as said, this was about response.

21:21.240 --> 21:25.080
And once again, Austin demonstrated his exceptional class.

21:25.080 --> 21:27.160
Saw some headbands, hit him up, wanted to collab.

21:27.160 --> 21:31.880
He didn't want to collab with me because he tried to say that the headbands were expensive.

21:32.440 --> 21:33.640
He was bullshitting.

21:33.640 --> 21:34.760
He was trying to get over on me.

21:34.760 --> 21:35.720
So I said, you know what, bruh?

21:36.920 --> 21:37.800
You know what?

21:37.800 --> 21:39.960
I'm going to have my grandma making my own headbands

21:40.760 --> 21:42.920
because everybody sell headbands in the stores.

21:43.640 --> 21:44.600
All the stores sell headbands.

21:44.600 --> 21:47.160
You ain't the first headband maker.

21:47.160 --> 21:48.520
Who the fuck you think you are?

21:48.520 --> 21:49.720
You the inventor of headbands?

21:49.720 --> 21:50.600
You idiot.

21:51.320 --> 21:52.440
So I made my own headbands.

21:52.440 --> 21:55.240
He got mad because I posted it and I had a little following.

21:55.240 --> 21:55.800
He got mad.

21:55.800 --> 21:57.160
Was wearing my headbands with L.

21:57.160 --> 22:01.400
He was like, this dude, he tried to take my idea.

22:01.400 --> 22:06.280
He took the idea where you put the banner on your head and you cross it and you tie it

22:06.280 --> 22:07.640
and you put it in your head.

22:07.640 --> 22:08.760
He stole that from me.

22:08.760 --> 22:13.720
Austin from the ACE family stole my art and I don't like him.

22:14.360 --> 22:15.240
Don't like him, right?

22:15.800 --> 22:21.880
So then a year later, just like Fred, the ACE family's blowing up.

22:21.880 --> 22:23.640
I'm itching for that clout pill.

22:23.640 --> 22:24.520
I need that clout.

22:25.080 --> 22:25.960
ACE family blowing up.

22:25.960 --> 22:27.640
They got over 10 million subs.

22:27.640 --> 22:29.000
I'm trying to get some attention.

22:30.040 --> 22:33.480
He comes out after we have made an ice cream truck from SD Wraps.

22:34.440 --> 22:37.960
They literally customize this random as fuck.

22:37.960 --> 22:40.040
They came up with it with their own brain.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.480
They made the ice cream truck literally in a day, right?

22:43.480 --> 22:44.760
We release it.

22:45.720 --> 22:49.960
He tries to come out and say, we took his idea from getting an ice cream truck.

22:51.720 --> 22:54.520
You know how many ice cream trucks are out there?

22:54.520 --> 22:57.480
That's the real positivity we love to see.

22:57.480 --> 23:01.240
And I'm making a slight observation here, but he's a bit of a dick.

23:01.240 --> 23:06.040
Once again, I can't tell you if this is true because I haven't seen any real counter-revelance.

23:06.040 --> 23:09.240
I'm open to alternative stories as the DMs were pretty vague,

23:09.240 --> 23:13.240
but he's just so angry and petulant about it that you kind of want to hate him.

23:13.240 --> 23:18.280
And this is one of the problems with the ACE family and most notably Austin's lack of empathy.

23:18.280 --> 23:21.320
It was the same problem that made his response to the basketball

23:21.320 --> 23:24.600
competition feel disconnected from what people were trying to say.

23:24.600 --> 23:28.760
Now, it's clear this isn't a formal response, so I can't judge it too seriously,

23:28.760 --> 23:33.000
but he just seems so angry at this guy because he sees anyone who criticizes like that as a

23:33.000 --> 23:36.920
clout chaser, even though he was only provoked by one specific incident later,

23:36.920 --> 23:38.040
which clearly bothered him.

23:38.040 --> 23:42.440
It was clear Urban was upset at the time, and the DMs, even if they were vague,

23:42.440 --> 23:46.680
showed a genuine pain, and Austin taps into that during that conversation,

23:46.680 --> 23:51.400
saying in the messages that Urban's coming at him like a woman, a very classy man.

23:51.400 --> 23:56.120
The contempt implies that he just can't acknowledge that he's ever made any missteps,

23:56.120 --> 23:58.520
or why anyone would ever be upset at him.

23:58.520 --> 24:01.800
And I think that rubs people the wrong way, it rubbed me the wrong way.

24:01.800 --> 24:06.360
Disclaimer, the problem of a lack of empathy is going to be a running theme in this video.

24:06.360 --> 24:10.440
When you see that side of Austin, it does bring into contention the notion and motives for the

24:10.440 --> 24:14.840
way that he interacts with his audience, he always speaks about him wanting to give back,

24:14.840 --> 24:19.240
but when people might come at him from an angle that implies they feel dissatisfied with his

24:19.240 --> 24:21.800
behaviour, he just doesn't seem to clock it.

24:21.800 --> 24:26.600
Selfless philanthropy in the way that the ACE family promotes is based on empathy for others,

24:26.600 --> 24:31.160
and it adds a shade of scepticism when they seem to demonstrate a lack of it in other areas.

24:31.160 --> 24:35.640
It doesn't necessarily prove an inability, but when you frame yourself in a way that anyone

24:35.640 --> 24:41.240
criticising you is a bad faith actor, and true ACE family members know how much they really do,

24:41.240 --> 24:45.960
it just gives me Greg Paul vibes, but whereas Greg Paul was overly defensive of destructive

24:45.960 --> 24:49.880
behaviour from his children, McBroom seems to have a basic ego problem.

24:49.880 --> 24:53.400
I don't want to doubt that the ACE family clearly do a fair bit for their audience,

24:53.400 --> 24:58.200
it's clear given their interaction, and I respect that, but it's hard to deny that they have fallen

24:58.200 --> 25:03.160
short at point, and when you fall short again, and again, and again, the criticism will begin

25:03.160 --> 25:08.040
to accumulate, and as said, Austin isn't one for official statements, unless they're completely

25:08.040 --> 25:13.000
unrelated to the actual criticism. What do I mean? Well, in spite of the fact that the ACE family

25:13.000 --> 25:17.400
seldom demonstrates sympathy for their critics, they're more than ready to expect it themselves,

25:17.400 --> 25:21.560
and often at opportune times, so I wanted to focus on this for the next part.

25:22.280 --> 25:26.280
I've already talked about a couple of instances where they seem to undermine standards that many

25:26.280 --> 25:31.080
would consider standard for that of a creator their size, but it does not end there. As a

25:31.080 --> 25:35.560
successful creator, it's likely that you may want to engage your audience through other mediums,

25:35.560 --> 25:40.200
this is something that the ACE family decide to pursue with the launch of their ACE family app.

25:40.200 --> 25:44.600
Now looking at it in its current state, reviews are overwhelmingly positive, so hopefully any

25:44.600 --> 25:49.320
problems there have been resolved, however at the time there were many people who had felt ripped

25:49.320 --> 25:53.720
off due to the lack of content. There were a couple of reasons for this, at least as I

25:53.720 --> 25:58.520
understand, and therefore the ACE family felt it was a good time to take a break.

25:58.520 --> 26:04.600
This is actually happening, we will be taking a break from YouTube.

26:04.600 --> 26:10.280
Not telling you guys how long, just yet, but we are taking a break. During our break,

26:10.280 --> 26:15.640
which is why we said it wasn't really going to be a break, we'll be focusing on our app along with

26:15.640 --> 26:19.160
our merch. For all the people who have the ACE family membership, we cannot thank you guys enough

26:19.720 --> 26:26.360
for all the love and support you continue to show us. Just know we have a lot coming, we're not going to say too much, we just want to upload exclusive content and show you guys.

26:26.360 --> 26:31.480
As many people interpreted this, it meant that they were going to be making content for the ACE family app, and therefore

26:31.480 --> 26:35.720
creating a paywall between them and some of their less privileged viewers. As said, there were

26:35.720 --> 26:39.800
complaints that they won't provide enough content on the app to justify the additional payment,

26:39.800 --> 26:44.440
so basically it felt like they were kind of failing on both fronts. Generally, unless you're

26:44.440 --> 26:49.080
really strapped for cash, it's good to make exclusive content as a bonus rather than taking

26:49.080 --> 26:54.920
it away from your public content. However, a break is a break, and in their defence, it's hard to say

26:54.920 --> 27:00.360
whether their comments were in reference to working on plans of their app or just the content itself.

27:00.360 --> 27:06.120
I feel that this situation was likely a boiling over of other situations, but it's clear that the ACE

27:06.120 --> 27:11.240
family at this point, after a run of controversies, probably had enough. This was all occurring in

27:11.240 --> 27:16.760
January of 2019, one of their most controversial months, with reference to the 100k basketball

27:16.760 --> 27:22.520
competition, and another incident involving the purchasing of a phallic lollipop for a child, which

27:22.520 --> 27:27.560
we'll get to later. Now, many people were focusing on the app at this point, but when they announced

27:27.560 --> 27:32.520
a break, I found it coincided very conveniently with the announcement of what is now known as the

27:32.520 --> 27:38.040
ACE family documentary, Welcome to Our Life. Now, to defend them on this front, this was probably a

27:38.040 --> 27:43.560
conceptual idea before the drama, but given their selected break that ends with their return, it's

27:43.560 --> 27:48.760
very easy to think where their focus in the ensuing month may have been. I don't know how much they

27:48.760 --> 27:53.400
worked on their merch or their app, but I think they had a bit of focus on this too. I like

27:53.400 --> 27:58.200
documentaries on principle, hell, there's even a documentary out there on me, and it won't be the

27:58.200 --> 28:02.840
last time that I try and make that sort of thing. From a filmmaking perspective, they can be really

28:02.840 --> 28:07.320
great, but I think one of my biggest problems with documentaries, even those like the ones from Shane

28:07.320 --> 28:11.960
Dawson, is that they can easily control the narrative and are often trying to make a statement

28:11.960 --> 28:16.920
on the actual character of an individual, rather than any greater message, and therefore it can be

28:16.920 --> 28:22.600
utilised, particularly by larger YouTubers, for propaganda reasons. It's very easy for an individual

28:22.600 --> 28:27.880
to own a narrative when they own the camera, even when they say it's behind the scenes. Behind the

28:27.880 --> 28:32.600
scenes documentaries were often gritty, and characters were sometimes unlikable because they

28:32.600 --> 28:37.240
had a unique value in their performance that no one else could substitute, and therefore their

28:37.240 --> 28:42.840
whole behaviour came with them. The modern day YouTube documentary can be very easily hijacked

28:42.840 --> 28:47.080
by an individual to elicit sympathy from their audience, and that's the impression I received

28:47.080 --> 28:51.720
when I heard about the Ace Family documentary. How do they follow through on it?

28:51.720 --> 28:58.120
And what we do is so difficult, I feel like people don't understand that there's really

28:59.080 --> 29:02.040
nothing private in our lives anymore.

29:02.040 --> 29:07.080
I decided to take on the burden of watching these episodes of it in case they said anything of interest,

29:07.080 --> 29:12.280
and the first episode was harmless enough, they talk about moving around and privacy issues, and although

29:12.280 --> 29:18.920
I wouldn't exactly consider $1500 a month apartment a struggle, it was alright. I understand that as

29:18.920 --> 29:24.120
public figures, they probably have a stressful life. My feelings were slightly mellowed by the end of the

29:24.120 --> 29:28.120
first episode, however they went straight into it with the second.

29:54.120 --> 30:02.920
I guess this is what many would consider an indirect response. It's completely coated with multiple other

30:02.920 --> 30:07.320
narratives, and is what many YouTubers will do if they don't feel like they can give a direct

30:07.320 --> 30:12.840
response to the criticism. They'll basically just create some straw man and say, wow, the haters do

30:12.840 --> 30:16.200
suck. It reminds me of that Jake Paul rap, you know the one.

30:16.200 --> 30:28.840
It sucks that media is often oriented towards the negative, but that's only because the negative actions

30:28.840 --> 30:33.640
aren't what you'd expect from an individual. It's out of the ordinary, and therefore people are more

30:33.640 --> 30:38.920
interested when a person indulges in it. That's not saying that you're a bad person, and mob mentality

30:38.920 --> 30:43.240
can sometimes lead to the wrong impression, we're all aware of that now, but to act as if all the

30:43.240 --> 30:48.280
backlash that you receive is representative to, for example, people being upset over tweets made

30:48.280 --> 30:52.760
seven or eight years ago is extremely deceptive. Does it mean that those people don't exist?

30:52.760 --> 30:58.440
Not at all, but they're certainly not representing the majority of what people are likely bothered by.

30:58.440 --> 31:02.600
Basically, this whole scene felt like Austin wanted to create something vague enough to

31:02.600 --> 31:08.760
invalidate and engrave it in the docuseries that throws in other, maybe very legitimate struggles,

31:08.760 --> 31:12.680
in an attempt to elicit sympathy from an audience that probably hasn't thought about

31:12.680 --> 31:16.360
the distinction between legitimate criticism and illegitimate criticism.

31:16.360 --> 31:23.400
People go out of their way to make something seem so different of what it is.

31:24.760 --> 31:32.440
Like, I literally just posted a snap of a Leia, like, me playing with her, her lay on her stomach,

31:32.440 --> 31:36.840
having tummy time, and now I'm getting bashed for it. What do you mean? What are people, like, people saying

31:36.840 --> 31:42.200
something? Like, yeah, they're saying I'm such a bad dad because I laid my newborn on her stomach,

31:42.200 --> 31:47.560
when it's literally just tummy time, like, everyone knows about tummy time. I laid her on her stomach

31:47.560 --> 31:50.760
to give her tummy time, I'm sitting there, like, making a cute snap with her,

31:50.760 --> 31:58.040
and now people are bashing me for it. Like, this is why Catherine and I hesitate to film our kid.

31:58.040 --> 32:02.600
He's representing the criticism that he receives by talking about this situation that I don't think

32:02.600 --> 32:07.000
anyone with a brain is going to be thinking about. Then there's the implication spread to the point

32:07.000 --> 32:12.040
that this is the sort of stuff being spoken about in the serious videos on him. He shows a reel of

32:12.040 --> 32:17.560
those videos, which it really isn't. I get that people being overly critical, mob mentality,

32:17.560 --> 32:22.120
they are all things that grind many of our gears, but to throw videos and to create this umbrella

32:22.120 --> 32:27.240
is dishonest, and playing the sad music and implying sympathy with a title like the truth

32:27.240 --> 32:30.840
about the Ace Family is about as heavy-handed as they come.

32:31.560 --> 32:37.800
Like I've said before, we're human, and we've made some mistakes, I mean, like, we're not perfect,

32:38.600 --> 32:43.880
but it doesn't mean that we're bad people, you know, and something coming out and circulating again

32:44.840 --> 32:48.040
is literally purely just to make us look bad.

32:48.040 --> 32:51.960
Here you are in a scene where they almost come to terms with their imperfections,

32:51.960 --> 32:56.040
but then they flip it onto their head and say anyone releasing this stuff is just trying to

32:56.040 --> 33:00.920
make us look bad, which given the criticism that I've discussed already is a fundamentally

33:00.920 --> 33:05.480
redundant statement, given that some of these criticisms came from your own fans,

33:05.480 --> 33:10.840
it's such an arrogant attitude that they try to masquerade in the oh woe is the struggle of the

33:10.840 --> 33:16.200
Ace Family narrative. Listen, there are problems that come with fame, I can get why unnecessary

33:16.200 --> 33:20.680
attention and criticism can bother you, but to speak generally and then provide an extreme

33:20.680 --> 33:25.400
circumstance to try and explain why you're actually suffering is like Al Capone asking why

33:25.400 --> 33:30.840
so many people were out to get him when all he did was evade taxes. Also, do you know how

33:30.840 --> 33:35.000
to say the word frustrated? Because I'm feeling pretty flustrated right now.

33:39.320 --> 33:40.040
Next part.

33:40.040 --> 33:56.360
There's good criticism, and bad criticism. If you can't separate it, I don't really have much

33:56.360 --> 34:01.080
respect for throwing an umbrella over it and arguing that they were the true victims. A lot of

34:01.080 --> 34:06.680
the criticisms that they received could have been resolved fairly easily, only donating 75,000

34:07.320 --> 34:12.680
donate an extra 25. Holding a basketball shootout where fans feel misled, do another one involving

34:12.680 --> 34:17.000
your fans, or at least do something involving your fans as compensation. People feel like you've

34:17.000 --> 34:23.000
screwed them over? Don't be a dick and go out and just talk a bunch of crap. It's not rocket science,

34:23.000 --> 34:26.920
and I get you don't want to yield on every occasion, but there's a point where principle

34:26.920 --> 34:32.120
pushes into stubbornness and you just end up looking unreasonable. And hell, when you actually

34:32.120 --> 34:36.760
make a mistake and you receive criticism that you can't respond to, apologise, or at least

34:36.760 --> 34:41.560
admit you got something wrong. The phallic lollipop is a prime example of something that

34:41.560 --> 34:47.160
could have just been solved with a tweet saying it was inappropriate, my bad, but it wasn't.

34:47.160 --> 34:50.840
The Ace Family are more than happy to admit they've made mistakes, but they'll never tell

34:50.840 --> 34:55.800
you which specific ones because they don't want to actually admit to anything. I don't think it's

34:55.800 --> 35:00.920
that demanding, and that's one of the things that I think just shows to me that McBroom has a

35:00.920 --> 35:05.560
significant ego problem, that they just don't want to ever say they've done anything specific wrong,

35:05.560 --> 35:10.760
and if you make any specific criticisms they will blow it up to a greatest character implication

35:10.760 --> 35:15.960
and say, how dare you, we're not bad people. Not everyone's saying you're bad people. Some of these

35:15.960 --> 35:21.240
critics are even your fans. It's very easy to see their whole documentary series as a beg for

35:21.240 --> 35:26.040
sympathy towards conflicted fans who may be on the fence about their behaviour, and I personally

35:26.040 --> 35:30.200
find it rather manipulative. The documentary was probably the most elaborate way to try and

35:30.200 --> 35:34.680
retain fans, it was probably done in the light of the success these Shane Dawson videos had yielded

35:34.680 --> 35:39.320
to, so it was a win-win. However, it's not the first time that people have accused them of baiting

35:39.320 --> 35:44.280
for sympathy, no, there was an even more notorious incident in the year prior, not too long after they

35:44.280 --> 35:49.560
had received a bitter stick for the 75k basketball situation. When something happens to you, it's

35:49.560 --> 35:54.440
natural for you to receive people's sympathies, which is why sometimes people are a bit suspicious

35:54.440 --> 35:59.000
about the motives of those who have terrible stuff happen to them not too long after they've

35:59.000 --> 36:04.520
received some criticism. This was the case for the Ace Family, who had their house robbed in July of

36:04.520 --> 36:09.960
2018, amongst a fairly decent wave of criticism. On one hand, this was met with a lot of sympathy,

36:09.960 --> 36:15.000
and people understood why the Ace Family were distraught over this. However, very quickly,

36:15.000 --> 36:19.080
suspicion began to boil up around the circumstances surrounding this incident.

36:19.080 --> 36:24.920
Did the Ace Family arrange or stage their own break-in? However, ladies and gentlemen,

36:25.480 --> 36:30.840
this is a crime scene, and we need someone on the case, so I have assigned Detective Jonathan

36:30.840 --> 36:36.280
Jawbury to deal with this matter, and to see if we can work out what can be said about the situation.

36:36.840 --> 36:40.600
I suggest we pass it over to him to present it and his subsequent findings.

36:42.520 --> 36:47.640
Parents often play a critical part in forming their child's first relationships,

36:47.640 --> 36:52.680
acting as a role model and exemplifying the types of behaviors they wish to see exhibited

36:52.680 --> 36:57.480
by their own one day. As such, children will always turn out best when their parents are

36:57.480 --> 37:01.640
there to nurture, love, and support them throughout their personal experiences,

37:01.640 --> 37:05.320
which is why we need more parents shoving cameras down their kids' throats for the

37:05.320 --> 37:10.120
sole purpose of internet clout. That was a joke. We don't need that at all, actually.

37:10.120 --> 37:15.320
But regardless, family vlogs have always been an integral aspect of YouTube as we know it.

37:15.320 --> 37:19.560
From the Shaytards all the way down to the Inghams, families will continue to play a

37:19.560 --> 37:24.120
significant role in the online zeitgeist. And although it isn't necessarily for me,

37:24.120 --> 37:28.760
I understand the appeal. People, children especially, crave the types of connections

37:28.760 --> 37:33.240
that can be easily accessed through internet personalities. When you watch Cole and Seth,

37:33.240 --> 37:37.480
for example, you aren't just another audience member, you're a part of their lives,

37:37.480 --> 37:43.400
adding to the immense power these figures often wield. Kids and families trust that these types

37:43.400 --> 37:49.000
of creators are being open and honest with them, giving them an elevated responsibility. Which is

37:49.000 --> 37:53.480
why many believe these channels deserve to be held accountable for their actions,

37:53.480 --> 37:57.800
hence why the Ace Family has been subject of such intense scrutiny.

38:04.040 --> 38:09.560
On August 16th, 2018, the Ace Family made waves in the community by uploading their famed

38:09.560 --> 38:14.280
Someone Broke Into Our House vlog, where the title pretty much tells you all you need to know.

38:39.560 --> 38:52.520
Their vlog documents the aftermath of a supposed home invasion that took place while the three

38:52.520 --> 38:57.800
were spending some quality time together at Disneyland. The half hour long video depicts

38:57.800 --> 39:03.480
police cars, smashed belongings, ransacked closets, and of course Austin and Catherine

39:03.480 --> 39:07.160
trying their absolute best to save face in the wake of a crisis.

39:09.560 --> 39:26.760
They both make a clear effort to drive home the fact that, oh,

39:26.760 --> 39:32.760
things can be replaced, but people, people can't. Which is nice, you know, I mean I don't think

39:32.760 --> 39:38.200
you'll find many who disagree with that sentiment, but to me they just seem a little too calm and

39:38.200 --> 39:43.800
collected to have just found out their 10 million dollar home was burglarized. Which was just the

39:43.800 --> 40:03.560
beginning of the suspicions more and more people would start to air. It's true that robberies can

40:03.560 --> 40:09.080
happen to anyone, anywhere, at any given time, but to ignore the glaring circumstances surrounding

40:09.080 --> 40:14.280
the family at the time of their break-in would be counterproductive. As James was quick to mention

40:14.280 --> 40:19.560
earlier, people do crazy things for sympathy, especially those who make their living by

40:19.560 --> 40:24.440
earning clicks online. Lord knows Austin and Catherine are no strangers to clickbait. Hell,

40:24.440 --> 40:28.760
even if the robbery did happen, they still went out of their way to stage a whole ass thumbnail

40:28.760 --> 40:34.680
to get that sweet, sweet CTR. It strikes me as a bit odd that just a few weeks prior to this

40:34.680 --> 40:40.040
incident, the whole basketball controversy went down in which people accused the family of stealing

40:40.040 --> 40:45.880
money from a charity event. So would it be within reason for someone in their position to stage a

40:45.880 --> 40:51.400
fake tragedy for the simple aim of gaining pity? Yes. But does that mean, without a shadow of a

40:51.400 --> 40:57.240
doubt, that the robbery was faked? No, not necessarily. Which is why we need to look at

40:57.240 --> 41:02.120
the details of the proceeding before we do anything else. At first, people were already

41:02.120 --> 41:06.600
suspicious of the way the police behaved on camera. Some viewers even going so far as to

41:06.600 --> 41:26.520
insist that they weren't even a part of the LAPD. A theory that was later reinforced when a fan dug

41:26.520 --> 41:32.920
up evidence of a place called Top Cop Shop in LA renting out fake police and squad cars on August

41:32.920 --> 41:38.760
16th, the same night the robbery reportedly took place. Catherine was quick to dismiss this smear

41:38.760 --> 41:43.640
campaign against her family on Twitter, though you can't really blame people for asking the question,

41:43.640 --> 41:49.560
can you? Renting re-enactors is not particularly uncommon in reality TV, leading many to wonder if

41:49.560 --> 41:54.760
they had just recreated the incident in an attempt to make their situation appear more dramatic for

41:54.760 --> 41:59.560
YouTube. Perhaps the family had suffered an actual home invasion a day prior and,

41:59.560 --> 42:04.840
being unsatisfied with the initial footage, rented out fake cops to hype it up for the cameras.

42:04.840 --> 42:09.400
After all, it couldn't have been completely fabricated. The real police report was posted

42:09.400 --> 42:14.120
by Keemstar on Twitter. Austin later appeared in an Instagram Live following the incident,

42:14.120 --> 42:19.400
showing unedited footage of someone checking for fingerprints the next morning, although it's

42:19.400 --> 42:24.600
pretty standard protocol to check for those kinds of things immediately after the incident takes

42:25.000 --> 42:29.800
as to not disrupt the crime scene. So, you know, that's a little sus. He also announced that the

42:29.800 --> 42:34.440
family would be moving to a new house since they no longer felt safe in their current home,

42:34.440 --> 42:39.640
leading some to assume that they simply trashed the house and left it, though that's a bit of a

42:39.640 --> 42:44.600
stretch considering it took almost an entire year for the move to officially happen, but even then

42:44.600 --> 42:50.200
it's not completely off the table, and we never saw any footage of the actual robbery. A 10 million

42:50.280 --> 42:55.960
dollar house is sure to come with cameras and alarm system at the very least, but despite their

42:55.960 --> 43:01.160
abundant coverage of the situation, they never so much as mentioned any of that. It just comes off

43:01.160 --> 43:06.040
so orchestrated to me, I don't know. Here we are being so honest with you guys, like you guys

43:06.040 --> 43:12.440
say the craziest rumors about us, like the craziest things. Someone is making a fake receipt

43:12.440 --> 43:19.240
of like us paying for cop actors, like these were real cops that were in her home. Like that's

43:19.240 --> 43:23.640
against the law to do that, to fake a receipt, to fake an invoice, that's against the law.

43:23.640 --> 43:28.600
That's crazy. That's slander. We have to leave our house, like we can't be here anymore,

43:28.600 --> 43:34.360
as much as I'd love to continue living in my home, we have to leave because it's not safe.

43:34.360 --> 43:38.520
Looking at the evidence, I believe something must have happened to them, but even that still leaves

43:38.520 --> 43:43.640
room for more unanswered questions. Things like why didn't these robbers take the diamond play

43:43.640 --> 43:49.160
button, and why was Austin filming the entire time as if to prove he wasn't hiding anything.

43:49.160 --> 43:53.240
Someone in their position probably wouldn't have behaved as orderly, given the tremendous

43:53.240 --> 43:58.280
shock and grief that must come along with getting your mansion ransacked while you're conveniently

43:58.280 --> 44:03.160
out at Disneyland. The Ace family is in such a position to where they can literally lie about

44:03.160 --> 44:07.000
anything to their audience, and they're not really going to be pressed for the real truth.

44:07.000 --> 44:12.360
The dishonesty of this family runs deep, and whether this was staged or not, people have

44:12.360 --> 44:17.880
every reason to question the parts of their life they publicized. The fact that this all came only

44:17.880 --> 44:23.240
two weeks after some of Austin's old problematic tweets resurfaced, coupled with their apparent

44:23.240 --> 44:28.280
inability to simply own up to their own mistakes, is enough to make anyone suspicious. But would

44:28.280 --> 44:34.440
this family really go through all the trouble of hiring fake cops to drum up a sensationalist story

44:34.440 --> 44:39.480
for the sole purpose of seeking reconciliation among their fanbase? That's something I'll let

44:39.480 --> 44:41.960
you decide for yourself.

44:41.960 --> 44:47.880
That was some intense detective work, but I'm proud to have YouTube's finest on the case, which I'm aware

44:47.880 --> 44:53.160
is the equivalent of kindergarten cop, but I think Jon would make an excellent Arnold Schwarzenegger,

44:53.160 --> 44:58.120
if Arnold Schwarzenegger was a tiny twink of course, but we love him all the same. I think probably

44:58.120 --> 45:02.760
the most frustrating part of the whole ordeal was once again their reaction to the idea that people

45:02.760 --> 45:07.640
may be doubting this. It's the same routine that we've seen time and time again, and you think they'd

45:07.640 --> 45:13.320
just be a bit more understanding of what's come their way, but they just don't have a clue how to

45:13.320 --> 45:19.000
fully get people to understand their perspective. Austin and Catherine have never been afraid to

45:19.000 --> 45:23.000
present an image of themselves to the audience, but they're also masters in orchestrating the

45:23.000 --> 45:27.960
representation of their lives, so house intrusions, whether legitimate or not, is obviously going to be

45:27.960 --> 45:32.760
seen by many as part of the melodrama, and many others as a distraction to how they actually act

45:32.760 --> 45:37.320
behind the scenes. However, even if they fake their intention for the good deeds, they're good

45:37.320 --> 45:42.840
deeds, and if they provide the right message for aspiring creators and parents, then that can't be

45:42.840 --> 45:50.280
a bad thing, right? But are they really truly virtuous, are they really who we should be looking up to?

45:50.280 --> 45:52.120
I'm just not entirely sure they are.

45:56.920 --> 46:00.680
Now as mentioned at the start, the move away from wholesome role models towards characters

46:00.680 --> 46:05.640
that inspire more cynicism is something that is impossible to avoid. The Ace family is no real

46:05.640 --> 46:10.520
exception to that rule, and I understand that, but I would also posit that in spite of this, family

46:10.520 --> 46:15.720
channels should be held to a marginally higher standard than those of Jake Paul, because although

46:15.720 --> 46:20.520
they are more than worthy of their criticism, like a lot of it, Jake Paul is at least the

46:20.520 --> 46:25.480
representation of a dumb privileged frat boy who just moved in with his friends. His antics

46:25.480 --> 46:30.200
represent a fleeting part of young adulthood that will eventually capitulate itself. He has the

46:30.280 --> 46:35.560
inspirational garbage, but it's so unbelievably inept that no one really buys it. With the Ace

46:35.560 --> 46:41.000
family, what they're doing is presenting this family life, which as mentioned, a cultural staple

46:41.000 --> 46:45.960
to many, a necessary stage of growth, and a part of everyone's life, whether positive or negative.

46:45.960 --> 46:51.240
On the one hand, I would hope that the Ace family realises their behaviour has an effect on probably

46:51.240 --> 46:56.280
the workings of many other families. On the other hand, it makes what we're about to talk about worse.

46:56.280 --> 47:00.280
I think this is what particularly vexed people are in the next couple of situations that we're

47:00.280 --> 47:05.160
going to be discussing. Let's talk about the lollipop. This situation once again occurred

47:05.160 --> 47:10.440
in January of 2019, as mentioned. Austin was taking a child out shopping, they go into what

47:10.440 --> 47:15.960
I assume is a novelty shop, or a more adult oriented shop, and then shock horror, on his

47:15.960 --> 47:20.120
Snapchat story, this is posted. He finds himself in some hijinks.

47:29.320 --> 47:33.400
Oh no, I can't believe she wanted the penis shaped lollipop,

47:33.400 --> 47:36.440
what madness. How on earth did that happen?

47:46.600 --> 47:52.200
Keep that in the bag forever, do not show that to anybody, okay? That's your little secret.

47:52.200 --> 47:59.160
Guys, I'm in so much trouble, but she said she's gonna steal it if I didn't buy it, so better me buy it.

47:59.160 --> 48:04.680
Oh damn it, Austin, he had to buy it for her, or else she was gonna steal it, damn.

48:04.680 --> 48:10.120
McBroom really got put in a tough situation here, I'm sure that everyone bought that very sincere

48:10.120 --> 48:16.520
explanation, they didn't, and there was immediate criticism for Austin, because he bought a penis

48:16.520 --> 48:21.640
shaped lollipop for a child, and then gave it to them. It was extremely inappropriate, and not the

48:21.640 --> 48:26.520
sort of thing that you would hope a family YouTuber to be doing. It's hard for me to be particularly

48:26.520 --> 48:32.360
angry, I was much angrier when Jake Paul just shouted at babies, so maybe I'm just desensitised

48:32.360 --> 48:37.240
to penis, but I do agree with the criticism. No doubt Austin clearly wanted a funny story,

48:37.240 --> 48:42.760
but knew he'd get stuck, so tried to pin the responsibility on the child. I think it illuminates

48:42.760 --> 48:48.280
one of the biggest problems with children in family vlogs. In their little documentary series, they say this.

48:48.280 --> 48:54.600
Like if Elle didn't like being in front of the camera, she was like, like if she was running away, and she wasn't

48:54.600 --> 49:00.920
like, you know, interacting, we would not be they family. No, we wouldn't, 100%. It would never be the same effect.

49:00.920 --> 49:06.280
And I just find it as a comment, rather redundant. Children that young can't exactly say whether they

49:06.280 --> 49:11.560
want to be on camera, even if they appear to enjoy it. Austin and Catherine constantly talk about how

49:11.560 --> 49:15.960
their life has changed due to the attention in the series, but hardly take a look at how it's going to

49:15.960 --> 49:20.200
affect a child at one of their most vulnerable times in their life. And when you're someone like

49:20.200 --> 49:25.320
Austin who clearly finds some value in the drama, you know, not being criticised for it could have

49:25.320 --> 49:30.440
genuine ramifications on your children. It's not like I'm against having children in family vlogs,

49:30.440 --> 49:35.080
but I don't think they should be a part of the drama that Austin tends to involve himself in.

49:35.080 --> 49:39.880
I don't think it happens on a rather excessive basis, but I think it's something worth noting,

49:39.880 --> 49:44.600
especially when looking at these dramas. This isn't exclusive, but it's a cumulative criticism they

49:44.600 --> 49:49.400
shouldn't ignore. Hell, one of their newest videos was originally titled as the children ranking

49:49.400 --> 49:55.160
seductive Halloween costumes, and you can see why it bothers people. Infants aren't props, and their

49:55.160 --> 50:00.680
innocence and wellbeing should be prioritised over the acquisition of views. The fact that they never

50:00.680 --> 50:05.480
really talk about these things just makes them poor role models, really, and I'll explain why now.

50:05.480 --> 50:10.840
Take this recent issue where Austin acquired a jet ski, and decided to ride it around his mansion's

50:10.840 --> 50:15.640
pool. According to many in the area, the amount of water discharged caused mudslides that created

50:15.640 --> 50:20.200
additional problems in the neighbourhood, including negatively affecting property and a great

50:20.200 --> 50:25.720
plantation, a complaint to have been made to the city but the antics continued. Now as far as I can

50:25.720 --> 50:30.840
see, there's not really much to imply this isn't the Ace family, it adds up. So eventually this was

50:30.840 --> 50:35.080
resolved in private, and Catherine did actually talk about it in their video, and removed the jet

50:35.080 --> 50:38.440
ski from the accommodation, in which she made this statement.

50:38.440 --> 50:43.320
Austin wanted to get into this jet ski, and there was nothing that I could do about it because,

50:43.320 --> 50:49.400
you know, Austin is Austin. At the end of the day, you know, sometimes I kind of have to be a team

50:49.400 --> 50:54.120
player, and accept some of the things that he's gonna do. To be honest with you guys, Austin has

50:54.120 --> 50:59.400
been doing crazy things for the past couple of years, you guys know that. You guys should see the

50:59.400 --> 51:04.680
things that didn't make it onto our channel because of me, so I'm like content patrol.

51:04.680 --> 51:09.800
After the first time that he used it, we actually got a complaint we were actually unaware of.

51:09.800 --> 51:13.800
The complaint went straight to our builder because the neighbour's actually friends with the builder,

51:13.800 --> 51:18.280
and so he's like, hey man, like there's water coming down on my property. Like originally when

51:18.280 --> 51:22.680
Austin rode the jet ski, I was under the impression, even Austin was under the impression, like no one

51:22.680 --> 51:27.240
thought that the water would like reach anywhere else. Even though yes, water reaches in other

51:27.240 --> 51:31.560
places, but because we have an infinity pool, we thought that the water was going down on like the

51:31.560 --> 51:36.040
bottom, or like the drainage part. Since we have like all this land that goes all the way down,

51:36.040 --> 51:40.360
we thought, oh it's just water, like you know, it's not gonna go anywhere. There's not that much water.

51:40.360 --> 51:45.160
So he hit our builder up, and he was like, hey like there's some water going here. So our builder

51:45.160 --> 51:51.640
actually took it upon himself, and built a whole entire retaining wall down below on our property.

51:51.640 --> 51:54.920
So he built that wall, and he actually didn't even tell us because it was my birthday. We were

51:54.920 --> 51:59.160
on vacation, so he said he didn't want to bother us with it. So yeah, when we came back and used

51:59.160 --> 52:05.800
the jet ski the third time, we got a complaint, and even though there was a retaining wall there,

52:05.800 --> 52:10.280
someone wanted to complain and say something anyways. Which I understand, like it's still

52:10.280 --> 52:14.600
the matter of the fact, but it's still my property that the water is going down on. But to be honest

52:14.600 --> 52:21.000
with you, if that were me, I would be so upset. Like if someone was putting anything on my property,

52:21.000 --> 52:25.480
like it doesn't even matter if it's water. So you don't want anything on your property. If I had a

52:25.480 --> 52:31.640
garden, or you know, like a garden of grapes, or like trees and stuff, like I wouldn't want anything

52:31.640 --> 52:35.880
on my property. So I completely understand, like if anyone were to be upset. But again, you know,

52:35.880 --> 52:40.760
there is that retaining wall that's there. But either way, I want the jet ski out.

52:40.760 --> 52:45.080
It kind of sucks that she didn't actually apologize. Sorry really does seem to be the

52:45.080 --> 52:49.480
hardest word for this family, but it could be worse. She does at least empathize with the people

52:49.480 --> 52:54.360
making the complaints. Then there's this recorded confrontation with Austin, which honestly

52:54.360 --> 52:58.600
feels kind of forced, but you know, at least they took action. Though I guess it would have been

52:58.600 --> 53:03.160
nice to see more of a personal acknowledgement from Austin, given that it was his antics on the

53:03.160 --> 53:15.480
jet ski that caused this trouble. Austin, how the hell did you get out of the pool? That jet ski is

53:15.480 --> 53:20.040
so heavy. How do you think it got in the pool? Me, and like four of my friends.

53:24.920 --> 53:32.040
You did not have people carried out of the pool. I did. To where? Where is it? Commenters stated

53:32.040 --> 53:37.080
how they felt Austin came across as rather rude and inconsiderate. As said, I hope it's fake,

53:37.080 --> 53:41.240
but it also seems dark that once again, he purposely missed out on the opportunity to be

53:41.240 --> 53:46.200
a bit more mature and take some responsibility. Maybe I'd be a bit annoyed too if I thought my

53:46.200 --> 53:50.840
partner had sold one of my items, but equally he was behaving so recklessly on it, and there was

53:50.840 --> 53:56.200
no use for it either. It's hard to really blame anyone but yourself. For the record, Catherine

53:56.200 --> 54:00.840
didn't actually sell it, she just put it in the garage. Although this issue is resolved, you don't

54:00.840 --> 54:05.400
really receive the impression that Austin has grown from the situation, and I think the idea of

54:05.400 --> 54:10.440
personal growth is important to the issue at hand, especially with a young or sensitive audience.

54:10.440 --> 54:15.240
Now fortunately, Catherine's framing kind of shows Austin in the situation for the juvenile

54:15.240 --> 54:20.040
individual that he is, but he's often the one at the helm, and he's the one with control over the

54:20.040 --> 54:25.640
narrative, which as we've shown, isn't always the best decision. Austin comes across as a bit

54:25.640 --> 54:31.560
immature, and the jet ski situation shows him as a big kid who loves his toys a little too much.

54:31.560 --> 54:36.200
He often seems to lack thought about how his actions affect others, and that's not a good

54:36.200 --> 54:40.600
thing for a creator his size. I think it'd be good for him to sometimes take a step back and

54:40.600 --> 54:45.400
look at the implications beyond his immediate family. With an impressionable audience,

54:45.400 --> 54:47.320
you're missing out on that opportunity.

54:50.920 --> 54:56.120
The public eye is a cruel mistress. It's true, it kinda sucks we focus on the negative rather

54:56.120 --> 55:00.920
than the positive, but by focusing on themselves as victims of the haters, they are doing exactly

55:00.920 --> 55:06.040
the same. The Ace Family still have millions of loyal subscribers who like and watch every

55:06.040 --> 55:11.720
single video they put out. Even at the peak of all the drama, they have completely persisted

55:11.720 --> 55:17.560
as creators in the spotlight with overwhelmingly positive like to dislike ratios, which I know

55:17.560 --> 55:22.840
doesn't mean everything, but they say enough about the strength of the Ace Family members.

55:22.840 --> 55:27.160
Does that mean that as public figures they don't have problems? No, not at all. In fact,

55:27.160 --> 55:31.000
the public eye can give you a lot of problems, but it doesn't mean those problems are sourced

55:31.000 --> 55:35.240
in criticisms that have yielded from public behaviour which to many people is fair enough

55:35.240 --> 55:40.440
to criticise. I think the Ace Family understand that, to be honest, because they do acknowledge

55:40.440 --> 55:45.560
it, but they try to link it back to public criticism in an attempt to deflect it. Deep down,

55:45.560 --> 55:49.880
the real problems with the public eye are, as always, how it can affect the personal,

55:49.880 --> 55:54.920
private lives of individuals, which has always been a problem for anyone with celebrity status,

55:54.920 --> 55:59.240
especially rumours of what's personally going on behind the scenes, and how the gossip can

55:59.240 --> 56:03.880
spread. This is something the Ace Family has been subjected to as well, and once again,

56:03.880 --> 56:08.520
that's the problem with family vlogs. I genuinely believe that vlogging your life in the way that

56:08.520 --> 56:13.640
the Ace Family does put your family at risk. We spoke about Austin's relationship with Catherine,

56:13.640 --> 56:17.960
but for the Family, it's a huge selling point. On Twitter, they only follow each other,

56:17.960 --> 56:22.840
and they publicly indulge in a lot of romantic behaviour and market it to their audience.

56:22.840 --> 56:27.080
However, in spite of this, many have become suspicious that it's a bit of an act,

56:27.080 --> 56:32.520
many relating to other reported behaviours from family members, mostly Austin. One of the prominent

56:32.520 --> 56:37.640
personal narratives is the one regarding Austin McBrun's faithfulness to his wife Catherine.

56:37.640 --> 56:41.960
There are a lot of individuals who have claimed that Austin's antics extend to other women,

56:41.960 --> 56:46.600
thus yielding to a narrative regarding infidelity that a lot of people believe. There have been a few

56:46.600 --> 56:50.680
videos and posts that have accused him of this. One that received a significant amount of coverage

56:50.680 --> 56:55.800
was a post by Belluck Gurr, who in posting an Instagram message she sent to Catherine on

56:55.800 --> 57:00.200
Twitter, stated that while Austin was in Miami for the weekend, he slept with one of her friends,

57:00.200 --> 57:04.840
and then made her sign an NDA. The author of this message said they couldn't stand quietly and let

57:04.840 --> 57:10.120
this happen, and wanted to let her know as a mother and a woman. She also posted an additional reply

57:10.120 --> 57:14.840
saying that she had all the proof and screenshots, and would only talk to Catherine. Catherine did

57:14.840 --> 57:19.400
see this, and she snapped back, saying that if there was evidence she wanted to see it,

57:19.400 --> 57:24.280
and if they were at risk of being sued due to an NDA, then she would pay for it out of her own

57:24.280 --> 57:29.960
pockets. There were no further public interactions in this exchange. And honestly, it's hard to really

57:29.960 --> 57:35.080
prove anything either way. There are a lot of claims about Austin's infidelity. Some had

57:35.080 --> 57:39.320
suggested that the person sending this message couldn't have been watching since Elle was still

57:39.320 --> 57:44.520
in the belly as their first video was the Q&A after Elle was born. However, as we know, looking

57:44.600 --> 57:49.640
at the social blade, it seemed there may have been videos before the first upload, so unfortunately

57:49.640 --> 57:54.200
that was a bit of a dead end. There were some additional conversations, and possible proof,

57:54.200 --> 57:59.240
but honestly it was not concrete at all, it was pretty flimsy, and therefore the situation just

57:59.240 --> 58:03.320
tailed off. Don't get me wrong, there are a significant amount of people who believe they've

58:03.320 --> 58:08.280
seen Austin cheating, you can't ignore that, but this is the sort of thing that would undeniably

58:08.280 --> 58:13.080
put stress on individuals within families, and a lot of it comes from the simultaneous popularity

58:13.080 --> 58:17.240
and unpopularity of Austin. There are various videos out there that quote,

58:17.240 --> 58:23.160
prove that he's cheating, and once again, it's really hard to ascertain what the truth is.

58:23.160 --> 58:29.560
All right, so it's really hard to make out, but this is Austin right here, so we'll just try to

58:29.560 --> 58:37.640
like slow it down somehow. So I think it's this girl right here, if you look really carefully.

58:43.080 --> 58:50.920
Alrighty, honestly it's hard to ignore the general case of cheating, given the amount of claims,

58:50.920 --> 58:56.120
but the number of people reaching to try and get a slice of the pie is just nauseating to follow.

58:56.120 --> 59:00.760
This eventually boiled over with probably the strongest allegations of them all,

59:00.760 --> 59:05.720
alluding to sexual assault. Published by YouTube by the name of Cole Carrigan, he uploaded a video

59:05.720 --> 59:10.360
called The Truth About The Ace Family, which is a 15 minute video detailing and promoting these

59:10.360 --> 59:11.960
allegations against him.

59:11.960 --> 59:17.640
So I know a lot of you guys are probably thinking, what does Cole Carrigan have to do with the Ace Family?

59:17.640 --> 59:22.280
Why is he inserting himself in something that has nothing to do with him? He should just become a

59:22.280 --> 59:27.960
drama channel at this point. Whenever it involves people that I love, I don't care who you are,

59:27.960 --> 59:33.080
I will speak what I want to speak, and if I have facts to speak, it will be said.

59:33.080 --> 59:37.080
In the video, he states how he came to the conclusion that he needs to come forward regarding this.

59:37.080 --> 59:41.400
He states that people have been threatened with lawsuits, and that he's not afraid to talk about it

59:41.400 --> 59:46.200
because he hasn't signed an NDA. He talks about how Keemstar had reached out to him and called him,

59:46.200 --> 59:50.920
before subsequently turning down the story because he took a 500k bribe from the Ace Family.

59:50.920 --> 59:55.400
We kind of just stayed low because we saw a bunch of tweets about people already knowing that he was

59:55.400 --> 01:00:00.760
uploading a video the next day about the situation, so we kind of were just like not worried, and we

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:06.440
were just gonna kind of let it unfold that way so we didn't have to insert ourselves where it wasn't

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:12.040
needed. The next day came and he didn't tweet anything, he didn't upload anything, so I texted

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:18.200
him saying how much did they pay you to keep quiet, and he responded with this, and I was

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:23.400
completely shocked. I immediately called my friend and told her that he was paid off $500,000 to keep

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:28.920
quiet about the situation, and that I needed to come forward. He then spoke about the situation,

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:33.880
he notes that there are NDAs involved, but that would be nullified in instances of rape, and that

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:39.240
this situation is now more important than that. So obviously my tweet got a lot of attention,

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:44.760
and someone from Austin Mcbruden's team actually texted my friend that this happened to,

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:50.680
I'll put the screenshot right here, basically saying that we should be careful and shouldn't

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:58.760
go any farther than what we're already doing to avoid legal action, and I proceeded to tell her

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:03.400
they're just trying to scare you, I just went through these exact same things, so I'm not scared.

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:08.120
I also didn't sign an NDA, and I also don't tolerate the shit that has happened to my friend.

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:13.320
So with that being said, I told her to ignore that message, because what needs to be said is going to

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:18.280
be said regardless, and if I need to say it, I'll do it, because I didn't sign an NDA, come arrest me.

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:23.560
So the story is that basically Austin approved a set of girls to come down and see him. They convened

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:29.000
in Miami around the 21st of July for an event, Austin went with his dad, Cole then provides

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.800
corroborating screenshots to show circumstantial evidence for the environment that preceded this

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:40.440
event, and then he goes into the details of the sexual assault. Disclaimer, this following clip will not be pleasant.

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:46.760
After they all had been drinking, my two friends went back to their room to go change because the sun was setting,

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:54.920
and that's when Austin, the security guard, the father, and two other guys came into their room.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:59.640
Obviously, I don't have recordings that went down in the room, but my friend told me that

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:07.720
she repeatedly said no multiple times, over and over and over, to the point where she started crying,

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:14.280
begging them to stop. That's when they forced themselves in her, and I will insert the photos

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:21.960
of the blood all over the bedsheets in the hotel room right here on the exact same date, June 22nd.

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:27.560
There are many more details, but I'd recommend watching the video if you're interested, it's strong stuff for sure.

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:32.520
He continues to show evidence of a conversation that followed, the felt provided more substantiation

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:37.400
to the environment that played into this, before having this friend who is the victim come on the phone

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:42.280
for an anonymous testimony. This testimony doesn't provide too much more, bar the detail.

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:47.880
If you want that, then I'd recommend you go listen. Ultimately, Cole concludes that this is enough evidence

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:52.760
to prove, beyond doubt, that Austin McBroom is not just a cheat, but a rapist, and someone who does not

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:55.160
deserve to be in such a position of power.

01:02:55.160 --> 01:03:00.920
Okay, so now that you literally have the point of view from somebody who was actually there,

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:08.040
that is enough proof, and I really don't need to provide anything else for you to see that Austin, his dad,

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:17.000
his whole security team are pieces of shit, and these are not people that should be given all this

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:24.840
crazy amount of success. I can't live with knowing that this type of person who's doing these things to people

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:32.440
is just like, winning at life, literally having everything just handed to them, money, fame, dah dah dah dah.

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:38.040
This was a huge problem for the Ace Family, with the public eye on them, it felt like everything was on the edge

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:44.680
of imploding, but what was going on behind the scenes wasn't quite as cut and dry as it seemed.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:04:03.000
I hate knowing that something this serious could put an end to the Ace Family, or such a loved group of people,

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.040
like I don't want to be that person, that's not what I'm here to do, I don't want to split up a family,

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:14.200
I don't want to end relationships, because I've been getting a lot of messages like that,

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:19.560
oh why don't you stay quiet, why are you trying to ruin or end this family, it's not about that,

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:24.360
like that's the last thing I want to do is rip someone's family apart or anything, but whenever

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:32.120
something this serious happens and it's to my friend and multiple other people are coming forward about

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:38.040
other experiences, it's just not something that I as a person can stay quiet on, it's just against my

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:43.720
morals and it's something I absolutely won't do, so that's why I am here making this video for them.

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:49.880
Wow, how honourable Cole. The video in question is hard hitting and powerful, and for a while the momentum

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:54.920
seemed solidly in Cole's favour, however the ties began to turn when additional details came out,

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:59.560
particularly regarding the claims he had made about Keemstar. Obviously, as we know in his video,

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:04.840
Cole claimed Keemstar was paid $500,000 not to cover the drama, but this was refuted pretty quickly

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:09.160
by Keemstar himself as he posted screenshots which showed he had followed up on his message by

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:13.880
clarifying he was being sarcastic. On top of this, logically speaking, there was no way that Keemstar

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:18.840
would have admitted something like that seriously and just casually in a DM like that, as it would

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:24.120
threaten his brand, given how much money it is likely Keemstar has already, I'm not sure $500k

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:29.400
would make a huge difference, and therefore this alternative story about sarcasm makes much more sense.

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:34.360
Cole's Dad- Frankly, you've been very adamant on Twitter that you are going to ruin the Ace family,

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:38.680
so if they did pay me off $500k, why would I tell you?

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:43.000
It doesn't reflect well on Cole, because it's a simple fact. If he's prepared to lie about this,

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.760
then what else was he prepared to lie about? It means later the other girl who was referenced in

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:50.920
the video comes forward with her own testimony. She doesn't say too much, but she says she felt

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:54.600
the video was not released for the right reasons, and that Cole had approached her under the

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:59.240
precipice that he thought they could make a lot of money off this. These DMs brought forward by

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:04.920
this other victim showed Cole not actually being concerned for the justice of victims, but showing

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:11.000
more concern in how much money it could make them. So I'm sure they would want to pay me $100k or more,

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:16.840
not to say shit, and then I could split that with you guys if you help me and send me all the receipts

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:21.000
that I need. With this additional information, McVroom jumped in, showing these DMs, and also

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.400
stating that he would be pursuing legal action. Although Cole has stated that he does not feel

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:29.080
that they are following through on that threat, he has also admitted that his intentions were not

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:34.040
pure at the start, but now he realises that the fight for justice must persist, and has found a

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:39.560
new reason, and I just hate this all. There were some additional tweets and allegations that were

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:44.680
just terrible, this set of screenshots were proven completely fake, really depressing. Catherine

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:49.560
responded too, but it was with this weird DM which I wasn't even sure was in the video, and I'm not

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:54.040
sure how it tied into the allegations, so I was confused about that. Oh, and one more thing, this

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:58.200
garbage tweet which implied that because he had made multiple statements about involving his lawyers,

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:03.560
it applied some kind of guilt. I don't think that's how it works, I think Austin has an ego,

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:08.520
I think he wants to make people who he feels accused him wrongly suffer, and I think that will

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:13.000
follow through. I think if this does go to court, you'll understand why he acquired lawyers. As a

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.160
quick side note, I thought it was really terrible also how people claimed the one of the girls was

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:22.600
paid off because she said Austin McVroom was not at fault. You know the sort of believe victims

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:27.320
parenthesis when they agree with me narrative that I find absolutely vulgar. Most of the people

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:31.960
involved in this situation are fundamentally unlikable, and I don't think many of the audiences

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:38.200
are equipped to handle this either. Trial by Tarot cards is a new one, I admit. I'd also like to add

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:43.160
that the girl has since deleted these statements from her Instagram but stands by them, understandably

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:48.040
she didn't want it to be a persistent aspect of her life. It's hard to say exactly what happened,

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:53.160
but I'm not going to dismiss experiences as people being paid off. It has become a bit of an

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:58.120
obsessive narrative, even on Keemstar's video where he shows the context to the DM, there are

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:03.880
people claiming he was paid off too. One person even said, watch Cole Carrigan's video as proof

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:09.160
despite that video. It's a mess, and people are projecting preconceived opinions to dictate their

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:13.400
position on something much more complicated. It's not impossible that someone's been paid

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:18.360
off somewhere, but on the other hand, being able to expose someone as paying you off could be just

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:23.480
as profitable in the online age, so people would be very cautious in offering individuals payments

01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:28.920
themselves. In spite of all this, I just feel bad for the daughters involved. But what about the

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:33.560
children cliche, I'm aware, but these are the controversies that are gonna make people's lives

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:38.280
a misery because people are taking a family life and turning it into a game of clout, and those

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:43.320
children didn't consent to that. This new drama is the point where it becomes destructive, I don't

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:47.720
know fully whose fault that is, but the fact that Cole can sit there and say he doesn't want to tear

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:52.440
a family apart but then make that video, extremely disingenuous. Austin has clearly been up to

01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:57.480
something too, the extent of it I'm not sure, but he needs to be more cautious. He's a huge creator

01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:02.520
now, congratulations, you live a lavish life, but you still have a family. This is the sort of stuff

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:07.000
that will harm a relationship even if your partner believes you, and the worrying thought is that

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:11.560
doubt that people are just staying together for the sake of the YouTube channel, that's not healthy

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:15.560
either. Families are meant to be natural, they're meant to exist because you want them to exist.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:20.440
If you can film that family life and make a quick buck then I'm not one to stand in your way,

01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:25.400
but the prime aim of a family is to surround yourself with people you love and provide a healthy

01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:29.880
environment to children who are going to be the next generation, and you want to provide them with

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:34.840
the principles that they stand by. Austin and Catherine obviously didn't ask for these allegations,

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:39.160
but people's negative judgement towards the Ace Family has been a result of a consistent failure

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:43.800
to empathise with other people, and so when the Ace Family needed empathy of their own, they didn't

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:48.600
get it. My empathy is free, I think it's shit that if false these allegations have surfaced in such

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:54.520
a way, pushed by an agenda hungry toxic individual who should be nowhere near dealing with cases,

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:59.240
as sensitive as this, but look at the controversies we've spoken about today, and ask yourself how can

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:04.440
you make audiences see your perspective more clearly. The Ace Family kinda suck, they seem fake,

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:08.040
they often seem entitled to think they're above criticism because of the good deeds they've done

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:12.280
which trivialises those good deeds, they lack empathy for others and yet try to manipulate it

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:16.760
out of their audiences through incidents or truth style documentaries, and generally they,

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:21.640
mostly Austin, seem to be ill-equipped to be role models to viewers, both adults and children.

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:25.400
This has built up a lot of contempt in critics because they've acquired this position of power

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:29.480
while not being particularly responsible, and so when these more serious allegations surfaced,

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:34.040
paired with the assumption that many people have that Austin is a cheat, people immediately wanted

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:38.600
to see the back of them, people wanted to take them down. I personally treat these allegations

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:43.800
with caution, given that it already seems muddy and the mix of vested interests

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:49.480
really doesn't reassure me. If it's real, then once again, terribly handled, and it should've been

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:54.360
kept out of someone like Cole's hands, I think most of the hatred towards them is an outcome of

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:58.920
them just constantly pissing off people, and although it is people's responsibility to not

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:03.320
be as presumptuous, it's incredible once again how quickly people have jumped to a conclusion,

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:08.120
I feel like it's a risk when you constantly shun people who criticise you, you're going to create

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:14.120
tension which in this instance, snapped. Let us move on to our conclusion from this lengthy saga.

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:26.600
The Ace Family seem to involve themselves in much more drama than a lot of YouTube families,

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:31.000
and they go this midway between responding to criticism and just straight up deflecting it or

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.160
victimising themselves, and they never seem to work out the simplest way to respond, either

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:40.200
because of ignorance or ego, probably both to a certain extent. Austin seems to be the worst

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:45.240
offender, he seems rather juvenile and reckless, he's basically Roman Atwood trying to be Jake

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:49.480
Paul, and Jake Paul shouldn't be a dad, he's already exploiting enough children as it is.

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:54.040
Catherine, although being somewhat more reserved, seems to at least be complicit in a lot of these

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:59.240
stunts and manipulative in many ways, often rationalising the behaviour and dodging the

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:04.360
criticism equally. Some people have accused her of being a gold digger, but no, it's kinda sexist

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:09.080
as it underplays her role in the actual channel, they're a couple, they are both beneficiaries of

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:12.840
their own interaction with each other, which means that you can't tell if there's something

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:17.800
really wrong because you really only see what they want you to see. It leads to fundamental doubts in

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:22.120
the authenticity of the relationship, it doesn't mean that those doubts are correct, but you can

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:26.200
see where they come from. They both kind of contribute to this mess that we've gone through

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:31.240
today in their own unique way, and even though they have their supporters, they also have a lot

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:36.360
of enemies, and individuals who do not have the best experience with them. If the stupid subtweets,

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:41.560
angry Instagram rants, and publicity stunts didn't rub someone the wrong way, they'll find something

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:45.720
equally obnoxious that will. Do I think they're the worst? No. When you've had to experience

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:51.320
individuals like Daddy05, it puts it in perspective, they make a lot of people happy, and I can't deny

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:55.560
that, but they still behave in a way where people are gonna lose out. There are incidents that have

01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:59.640
maybe questioned their intent, which is important when you're dealing with a larger young audience

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:04.120
who are prone to exploitation, and I haven't even spoken about every incident. They're promoting a

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:08.920
message to millions of people, and some are going to take issue with that, especially when it's poorly

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:14.120
delivered, it is inevitability. They can't be upset at that principle, they can be upset when people

01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:19.960
falsely accuse stuff that might jeopardise the private life of individuals involved, and cause trust rifts

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:24.680
where they may not be warranted. As said, I can't tell you how much of what's been said is true,

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:29.640
but I'd probably be pretty upset too. Equally be aware that provided Cole's allegations are false,

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:34.280
it is probably a cause of crying wolf, their behaviour building up a negative perception so that

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:38.920
when something negative happened to them, people took the easiest explainable route. The point is

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:43.480
though, sometimes the wolf is actually there. It's important to remember that people who've been wrong

01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:48.680
can be in the right, but it's also a case for why the Ace Family should try and build a better rapport

01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:53.560
with their critics. Family channels are changing, Austin McBroom, the Ace Family, definitely seek to

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:58.200
pursue a different relationship with their audience, and on principle, I can respect that. However,

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:03.640
their conduct in other ways certainly hasn't been as high to a standard as many would hope, and the

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:08.600
standard does have to be kind of higher for a family channel, not just for the sake of the audience,

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:13.320
but for the children. I hope they really do feel involved with their channel because it's not something

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:17.400
you should force. Right now, the kids are really young, so they're unlikely to specifically remember

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:22.360
that much, but this sort of stuff can still really affect the development of a child. I hope they get

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:26.840
out of this drama-embroiled side of YouTube, and learn how to deal with the nature of controversy

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:30.520
a bit better. At the end of the day, people are still going to look up to them as role models,

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:35.240
they're still a monumentally sized channel, and they're still parents. I hope all innocents

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:39.720
prevailing, they have the chance to have that family life they sometimes claim to desire.

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:46.200
I've never thought about stopping, but I feel like if we... I've thought about it.

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:53.880
Really? Yeah. Really? I have.

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.640
That is, if they really want it.

01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:03.720
So yes, that's the video. What a fun time we had here, it has been banging. Go and check out Jay

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:09.400
Aubrey, he is a darling, we love him so much on this channel. This is the first time he's actually

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:15.080
been on I think, and hopefully not the last. He's a great creator, and I can't endorse him enough,

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:19.240
most people probably know him at this stage, but hey, go and check him out if you haven't.

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:23.000
I also wanna give a shout out to the editors, once again a lot of editors on this one,

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.720
and they all got a deliver, and hopefully like the postman, they did. If they didn't, well...

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:30.040
There'll be rations in the dungeon for a few days.

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:41.560
I'd also like to give a big thank you to my Patreons, $10 Patreons are up on screen right now,

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:49.560
and big, big thank you to some hullabaloo Nico Deschamps and Caroline, $50 Patreons, thank you

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:55.400
so much, you're fantastic, I really appreciate it, and a very special thanks to my $100 Patreon,

01:15:55.400 --> 01:16:00.280
Brandon, fabulous, Brandon's been here for so long, you gotta love that, you love to see it,

01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:05.800
I love to see it, thank you Brandon, you're the, you're the mother, you're the motherfucking G,

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:11.640
you're the G. My Twitter, at TheRightOpinion, you can reach me on there, I do respond to DMs there,

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:16.280
Facebook, I haven't responded to DMs for a while, I need to check that out, and Discord, links in

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:20.040
the pinned comment, you can go and check it out, I'm gonna try and be more active in all of it,

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:24.040
but it's all over the place because I'm all over the place, that's how I roll, you probably know

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:27.960
that by now, other than that I don't really have too much else to add, take care of yourselves

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:32.680
guys, hope you're having a good week, and I'm sending my love out to all of you.
