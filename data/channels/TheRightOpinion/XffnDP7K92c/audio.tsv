0	2000	Here's a request I decided to take on.
8000	12000	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the right opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
12000	14000	And let's talk about parties.
14000	19000	No, not the mediocre house party that you went to and got absolutely wanker'd before passing out on the jizz-stained sofa.
19000	21000	I mean political parties.
21000	24000	Specifically, third parties in the grand United States of America.
24000	28000	Now third parties are generally under-represented, and there are two reasons for that.
28000	30000	The status quo, and obviously
33000	39000	It's a constant loop, and no one can even touch the amount of money spent on party promotion between the Democrats and the Republicans.
39000	42000	And the media's focus only accentuates the advantage as well.
42000	47000	But there's not much more to say here, the system is bullshit and it'll probably stay bullshit for a while to come.
47000	53000	But let's have a look at what the other options may or may not be on your ballot paper depending on where you live.
53000	58000	We're going to talk about the one and only other party that you can vote for all over in the land of the free.
58000	60000	The Libertarian party.
60000	62000	This is the prominent one that some people care about.
62000	70000	Basically they have more conservative oriented economic policies and more socially liberal policies that wouldn't be out of place in the Democrat party.
70000	77000	To sum up, with respect to economics, they want lower taxes, to abolish the IRS, to decrease the national debt,
77000	82000	to allow people to opt out of social security, and they also want to eliminate the welfare state.
82000	88000	On the social side, they support same sex marriage, ending capital punishment, and want to end the prohibition on drugs.
88000	95000	The only social issue they're quite uniform on is the support of gun ownership, which is unsurprising given how the US public feel about it.
107000	111000	They could probably amass some support if they had any coverage at all.
111000	117000	The only coverage right now is Gary Johnson, the head of the party, not knowing where or what Aleppo is.
117000	121000	I think it's highly likely that they'll garner more votes than previous elections.
121000	125000	They're on every ballot paper this time around, and that should definitely help them.
125000	129000	Progress, albeit little by little, is what matters.
129000	134000	Now we have the Green party, which is, needless to say, fairly standard of what you'd expect of any country's Green party.
134000	144000	However, if you live in Nevada, Oklahoma, or South Dakota, you'll be disappointed to hear that you won't be able to vote for your favorite revolutionary far left political force.
144000	151000	I don't know what else to say about them really, mainly because their website is a fucking bitch to navigate, and because their policies are pretty typical.
151000	155000	Far left, far left, far left, far left, and far left to sum up.
155000	158000	If that's your cup of tea, then fair enough.
159000	166000	And then we have our independent candidate this time around, good old Evan McMullin, who's doing quite well in Utah, but no other state.
166000	170000	He's basically the pro-Muslim Republican alternative to Donald Trump.
170000	175000	Most of his policies are quite conservative with regards to military abortion, all the usual suspects.
175000	182000	However, he is in favor of maintaining Obamacare, though, which is interesting, although he does think the US can do better.
182000	189000	He's certainly a political force, to say the least, and it'll be intriguing to see if he can win Utah, although unlikely.
189000	191000	So what does that leave us with?
191000	201000	The final, the one, the only, Constitution party who want to restore the USA to their biblical foundations.
201000	204000	One of their policies is to oppose suicide.
204000	211000	Admittedly, Admiral, but it would be slightly hard to enforce as a legal policy.
211000	214000	To sum up, these guys have no chance.
214000	220000	They also oppose pornography, and that is a deal breaker with most hard-wanky, I mean hard-working Americans.
220000	223000	Listen, I don't need to go into too much depth.
223000	227000	If you've read the Bible, like most people haven't, oh shit.
227000	229000	Oh well, just fuck it, take a guess.
229000	231000	Christian stuff.
231000	233000	So, what do I think?
233000	239000	I'd say the Libertarian Party would have the best chance collectively at splitting the vote, but they don't have enough gravitas this election.
239000	245000	Maybe sometime in the future they'll rise, their policies seem to be the most realistic to the American voting demographic,
245000	252000	although they're kind of trying to be this political middle between two sides that are pretty thinly spread and pretty incompatible with each other.
252000	258000	That may change in the future, and I hopefully won't see this domination that does really narrow the political debate,
258000	265000	because although I don't agree with all their policies, it would certainly be interesting to have a balancing factor.
266000	271000	Anyway, we're well into election month, and I'm enjoying this thoroughly, I hope you are.
271000	275000	I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
295000	297000	Thanks for watching!
