00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Here's a request I decided to take on.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the right opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
And let's talk about parties.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
No, not the mediocre house party that you went to and got absolutely wanker'd before passing out on the jizz-stained sofa.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
I mean political parties.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Specifically, third parties in the grand United States of America.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
Now third parties are generally under-represented, and there are two reasons for that.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
The status quo, and obviously

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
It's a constant loop, and no one can even touch the amount of money spent on party promotion between the Democrats and the Republicans.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
And the media's focus only accentuates the advantage as well.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
But there's not much more to say here, the system is bullshit and it'll probably stay bullshit for a while to come.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
But let's have a look at what the other options may or may not be on your ballot paper depending on where you live.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
We're going to talk about the one and only other party that you can vote for all over in the land of the free.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
The Libertarian party.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
This is the prominent one that some people care about.

01:02.000 --> 01:10.000
Basically they have more conservative oriented economic policies and more socially liberal policies that wouldn't be out of place in the Democrat party.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
To sum up, with respect to economics, they want lower taxes, to abolish the IRS, to decrease the national debt,

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
to allow people to opt out of social security, and they also want to eliminate the welfare state.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.000
On the social side, they support same sex marriage, ending capital punishment, and want to end the prohibition on drugs.

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
The only social issue they're quite uniform on is the support of gun ownership, which is unsurprising given how the US public feel about it.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
They could probably amass some support if they had any coverage at all.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
The only coverage right now is Gary Johnson, the head of the party, not knowing where or what Aleppo is.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
I think it's highly likely that they'll garner more votes than previous elections.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
They're on every ballot paper this time around, and that should definitely help them.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
Progress, albeit little by little, is what matters.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
Now we have the Green party, which is, needless to say, fairly standard of what you'd expect of any country's Green party.

02:14.000 --> 02:24.000
However, if you live in Nevada, Oklahoma, or South Dakota, you'll be disappointed to hear that you won't be able to vote for your favorite revolutionary far left political force.

02:24.000 --> 02:31.000
I don't know what else to say about them really, mainly because their website is a fucking bitch to navigate, and because their policies are pretty typical.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
Far left, far left, far left, far left, and far left to sum up.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
If that's your cup of tea, then fair enough.

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
And then we have our independent candidate this time around, good old Evan McMullin, who's doing quite well in Utah, but no other state.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
He's basically the pro-Muslim Republican alternative to Donald Trump.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
Most of his policies are quite conservative with regards to military abortion, all the usual suspects.

02:55.000 --> 03:02.000
However, he is in favor of maintaining Obamacare, though, which is interesting, although he does think the US can do better.

03:02.000 --> 03:09.000
He's certainly a political force, to say the least, and it'll be intriguing to see if he can win Utah, although unlikely.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
So what does that leave us with?

03:11.000 --> 03:21.000
The final, the one, the only, Constitution party who want to restore the USA to their biblical foundations.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
One of their policies is to oppose suicide.

03:24.000 --> 03:31.000
Admittedly, Admiral, but it would be slightly hard to enforce as a legal policy.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
To sum up, these guys have no chance.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
They also oppose pornography, and that is a deal breaker with most hard-wanky, I mean hard-working Americans.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
Listen, I don't need to go into too much depth.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
If you've read the Bible, like most people haven't, oh shit.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Oh well, just fuck it, take a guess.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Christian stuff.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
So, what do I think?

03:53.000 --> 03:59.000
I'd say the Libertarian Party would have the best chance collectively at splitting the vote, but they don't have enough gravitas this election.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
Maybe sometime in the future they'll rise, their policies seem to be the most realistic to the American voting demographic,

04:05.000 --> 04:12.000
although they're kind of trying to be this political middle between two sides that are pretty thinly spread and pretty incompatible with each other.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
That may change in the future, and I hopefully won't see this domination that does really narrow the political debate,

04:18.000 --> 04:25.000
because although I don't agree with all their policies, it would certainly be interesting to have a balancing factor.

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
Anyway, we're well into election month, and I'm enjoying this thoroughly, I hope you are.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Thanks for watching!
