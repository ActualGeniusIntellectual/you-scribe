00:00.000 --> 00:04.080
Oh yeah, I've only gone and fucking done it.

00:09.520 --> 00:14.720
Hello and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of twats with too much free time.

00:14.720 --> 00:20.560
And yes, today I'm addressing the one that everyone's been expecting me to, the EU debate.

00:20.560 --> 00:25.040
And to be honest, I'm not surprised a lot of people have wanted me to do a video on this.

00:25.040 --> 00:28.480
It is undoubtedly an extremely important vote.

00:28.480 --> 00:32.320
This video isn't going to be on which way I'm voting, but more to the point of how

00:32.320 --> 00:38.160
poor this topic has been covered by politicians and the media in general, on both sides of the campaign.

00:38.160 --> 00:42.800
So before you get bored as shit, let's look at the headlines to understand what I'm saying.

00:42.800 --> 00:47.840
So the main story right now is Barack Obama coming to the UK and telling everyone that

00:47.840 --> 00:51.840
leaving the EU is a bad thing and staying in the EU is a good thing.

00:51.840 --> 00:54.560
Now this bemuses me straight away for many reasons,

00:54.560 --> 00:58.400
and it hurts coming from someone who is quite a big fan of Barack Obama.

00:58.400 --> 01:02.080
If Barack Obama had come along and bought his own personal business analysis and

01:02.080 --> 01:06.080
forecasts explaining why leaving the EU would be detrimental for Britain's economy,

01:06.080 --> 01:07.600
then I appreciate this speech.

01:08.480 --> 01:12.720
But yet I'm frustrated as he literally has just echoed what everyone in the

01:12.720 --> 01:15.040
in campaign has been saying the whole time.

01:15.040 --> 01:18.880
And this demonstrates to me how much this EU debate has become about

01:18.880 --> 01:21.280
personalities instead of actual context.

01:21.280 --> 01:25.680
Whose side is Boris Johnson on? Whose side is Obama on? Whose side is the bloody Queen on?

01:25.680 --> 01:28.800
There's been more name dropping than the 21st century rap song.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.840
Just because someone who is in an important role takes an opinion

01:31.840 --> 01:33.680
doesn't mean that opinion is correct,

01:33.680 --> 01:38.720
or any more trustworthy than that of, say, an economist or an accountant or me.

01:38.720 --> 01:40.960
And yet because of their gravitas and their fame,

01:40.960 --> 01:45.280
the newspapers are more interested in reporting on these sorts of scaremongering,

01:45.280 --> 01:47.520
which once again, both sides are guilty of.

01:47.520 --> 01:48.800
Let's talk about that.

01:48.800 --> 01:53.120
I could talk about Obama's speech, but I do like to bring some variation to this channel.

01:53.120 --> 01:57.520
So first we have Michael Gove, who claimed that voting to stay in the EU

01:57.520 --> 01:59.680
would be like voting to remain hostages.

01:59.680 --> 02:01.600
I have many criticisms of the EU.

02:01.600 --> 02:05.200
One of them, however, is not that they are holding us at gunpoint.

02:05.200 --> 02:09.360
Then we have good old George Osborne, my favourite chancellor,

02:09.360 --> 02:13.120
using his university degree in modern history to demonstrate that he knows

02:13.120 --> 02:16.880
sweet fuck all in economics, claiming that mortgage rates may rise,

02:16.880 --> 02:19.200
that income tax may increase.

02:19.200 --> 02:22.560
But he's not in control of those rates, so he can't be sure.

02:22.560 --> 02:27.120
However, my favourite indirect attack has to be this delicious pick

02:27.120 --> 02:29.920
from everyone's favourite newspaper, the Daily Mail,

02:29.920 --> 02:33.440
who talk about how Obama replaced the bust of Winston Churchill

02:33.440 --> 02:36.240
in the White House with that of Martin Luther King.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.400
Wow, what a disgrace.

02:44.400 --> 02:45.840
Changing furniture.

02:45.840 --> 02:48.720
You'd have thought that it was his fucking house.

02:48.720 --> 02:51.120
And bring it back to the George Osborne point,

02:51.200 --> 02:52.720
it's another thing that pisses me off.

02:52.720 --> 02:54.560
Everyone speaks in conditionals.

02:54.560 --> 02:55.760
Something may happen.

02:55.760 --> 02:56.720
This might happen.

02:56.720 --> 02:57.600
That might happen.

02:57.600 --> 02:58.320
You know what?

02:58.320 --> 03:01.920
The day after the EU vote, David Cameron may defect to the BMP

03:01.920 --> 03:03.600
and become a vegan stoner.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.400
That's the thing.

03:04.400 --> 03:09.040
As long as you put May before something, you can say anything that could potentially happen.

03:09.040 --> 03:14.320
It's this classic media tactic employed by everyone who is remotely influential

03:14.320 --> 03:16.320
and it's pissing me off.

03:17.520 --> 03:20.400
And people don't want to know what may happen.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.640
People want to know what will happen.

03:22.640 --> 03:26.880
And the fact that the public are not aware of this information is a failing of the media,

03:26.880 --> 03:31.360
who are more interested in reporting on the latest Conservative Party civil war

03:31.360 --> 03:34.240
rather than the actual motions of leaving or staying.

03:34.240 --> 03:37.040
And I've looked up a lot of information and even read a book.

03:37.040 --> 03:38.240
Yes, me.

03:38.240 --> 03:39.520
I read a fucking book.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.800
I don't even read books, mate.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.800
So you know how important it must be then.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.360
But that's because I'm a twat with too much free time.

03:45.360 --> 03:46.240
I can do that.

03:46.240 --> 03:48.480
If you're a parent working full time,

03:48.480 --> 03:51.840
then I'm sure you'd love to have the time to do some in-depth research on the EU,

03:51.840 --> 03:53.040
but you just don't have it.

03:53.040 --> 03:57.840
All you hear is the same fear-filled rhetoric without engaging in any meaningful debate.

03:57.840 --> 04:00.960
And that's what we really need in a vote so decisive.

04:00.960 --> 04:03.600
So I can't see this one causing any controversy.

04:03.600 --> 04:04.720
What do you think?

04:04.720 --> 04:08.240
Please let your imagination run wild and comment what you want.

04:08.240 --> 04:10.880
As long as it doesn't breach the YouTube guidelines, that is.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.800
Apart from that, have fun.

04:12.800 --> 04:13.600
Get creative.

04:13.600 --> 04:25.440
Anyway, on the right hand side.
