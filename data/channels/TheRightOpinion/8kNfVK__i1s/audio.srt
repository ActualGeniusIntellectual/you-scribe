1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Oh yeah, I've only gone and fucking done it.

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,720
Hello and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of twats with too much free time.

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,560
And yes, today I'm addressing the one that everyone's been expecting me to, the EU debate.

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,040
And to be honest, I'm not surprised a lot of people have wanted me to do a video on this.

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,480
It is undoubtedly an extremely important vote.

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,320
This video isn't going to be on which way I'm voting, but more to the point of how

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,160
poor this topic has been covered by politicians and the media in general, on both sides of the campaign.

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,800
So before you get bored as shit, let's look at the headlines to understand what I'm saying.

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,840
So the main story right now is Barack Obama coming to the UK and telling everyone that

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,840
leaving the EU is a bad thing and staying in the EU is a good thing.

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,560
Now this bemuses me straight away for many reasons,

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,400
and it hurts coming from someone who is quite a big fan of Barack Obama.

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,080
If Barack Obama had come along and bought his own personal business analysis and

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,080
forecasts explaining why leaving the EU would be detrimental for Britain's economy,

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,600
then I appreciate this speech.

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,720
But yet I'm frustrated as he literally has just echoed what everyone in the

17
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,040
in campaign has been saying the whole time.

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,880
And this demonstrates to me how much this EU debate has become about

19
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,280
personalities instead of actual context.

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,680
Whose side is Boris Johnson on? Whose side is Obama on? Whose side is the bloody Queen on?

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,800
There's been more name dropping than the 21st century rap song.

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,840
Just because someone who is in an important role takes an opinion

23
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,680
doesn't mean that opinion is correct,

24
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,720
or any more trustworthy than that of, say, an economist or an accountant or me.

25
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,960
And yet because of their gravitas and their fame,

26
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,280
the newspapers are more interested in reporting on these sorts of scaremongering,

27
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,520
which once again, both sides are guilty of.

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,800
Let's talk about that.

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,120
I could talk about Obama's speech, but I do like to bring some variation to this channel.

30
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,520
So first we have Michael Gove, who claimed that voting to stay in the EU

31
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,680
would be like voting to remain hostages.

32
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,600
I have many criticisms of the EU.

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,200
One of them, however, is not that they are holding us at gunpoint.

34
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,360
Then we have good old George Osborne, my favourite chancellor,

35
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,120
using his university degree in modern history to demonstrate that he knows

36
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,880
sweet fuck all in economics, claiming that mortgage rates may rise,

37
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,200
that income tax may increase.

38
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,560
But he's not in control of those rates, so he can't be sure.

39
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,120
However, my favourite indirect attack has to be this delicious pick

40
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,920
from everyone's favourite newspaper, the Daily Mail,

41
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,440
who talk about how Obama replaced the bust of Winston Churchill

42
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,240
in the White House with that of Martin Luther King.

43
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,400
Wow, what a disgrace.

44
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,840
Changing furniture.

45
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,720
You'd have thought that it was his fucking house.

46
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,120
And bring it back to the George Osborne point,

47
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,720
it's another thing that pisses me off.

48
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,560
Everyone speaks in conditionals.

49
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,760
Something may happen.

50
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,720
This might happen.

51
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,600
That might happen.

52
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,320
You know what?

53
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,920
The day after the EU vote, David Cameron may defect to the BMP

54
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,600
and become a vegan stoner.

55
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,400
That's the thing.

56
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,040
As long as you put May before something, you can say anything that could potentially happen.

57
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,320
It's this classic media tactic employed by everyone who is remotely influential

58
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,320
and it's pissing me off.

59
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,400
And people don't want to know what may happen.

60
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,640
People want to know what will happen.

61
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,880
And the fact that the public are not aware of this information is a failing of the media,

62
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,360
who are more interested in reporting on the latest Conservative Party civil war

63
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,240
rather than the actual motions of leaving or staying.

64
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,040
And I've looked up a lot of information and even read a book.

65
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,240
Yes, me.

66
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,520
I read a fucking book.

67
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,800
I don't even read books, mate.

68
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
So you know how important it must be then.

69
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,360
But that's because I'm a twat with too much free time.

70
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,240
I can do that.

71
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,480
If you're a parent working full time,

72
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,840
then I'm sure you'd love to have the time to do some in-depth research on the EU,

73
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,040
but you just don't have it.

74
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,840
All you hear is the same fear-filled rhetoric without engaging in any meaningful debate.

75
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,960
And that's what we really need in a vote so decisive.

76
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,600
So I can't see this one causing any controversy.

77
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,720
What do you think?

78
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,240
Please let your imagination run wild and comment what you want.

79
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,880
As long as it doesn't breach the YouTube guidelines, that is.

80
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,800
Apart from that, have fun.

81
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,600
Get creative.

82
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:25,440
Anyway, on the right hand side.
