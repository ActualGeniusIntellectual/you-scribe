0	4080	Oh yeah, I've only gone and fucking done it.
9520	14720	Hello and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of twats with too much free time.
14720	20560	And yes, today I'm addressing the one that everyone's been expecting me to, the EU debate.
20560	25040	And to be honest, I'm not surprised a lot of people have wanted me to do a video on this.
25040	28480	It is undoubtedly an extremely important vote.
28480	32320	This video isn't going to be on which way I'm voting, but more to the point of how
32320	38160	poor this topic has been covered by politicians and the media in general, on both sides of the campaign.
38160	42800	So before you get bored as shit, let's look at the headlines to understand what I'm saying.
42800	47840	So the main story right now is Barack Obama coming to the UK and telling everyone that
47840	51840	leaving the EU is a bad thing and staying in the EU is a good thing.
51840	54560	Now this bemuses me straight away for many reasons,
54560	58400	and it hurts coming from someone who is quite a big fan of Barack Obama.
58400	62080	If Barack Obama had come along and bought his own personal business analysis and
62080	66080	forecasts explaining why leaving the EU would be detrimental for Britain's economy,
66080	67600	then I appreciate this speech.
68480	72720	But yet I'm frustrated as he literally has just echoed what everyone in the
72720	75040	in campaign has been saying the whole time.
75040	78880	And this demonstrates to me how much this EU debate has become about
78880	81280	personalities instead of actual context.
81280	85680	Whose side is Boris Johnson on? Whose side is Obama on? Whose side is the bloody Queen on?
85680	88800	There's been more name dropping than the 21st century rap song.
88800	91840	Just because someone who is in an important role takes an opinion
91840	93680	doesn't mean that opinion is correct,
93680	98720	or any more trustworthy than that of, say, an economist or an accountant or me.
98720	100960	And yet because of their gravitas and their fame,
100960	105280	the newspapers are more interested in reporting on these sorts of scaremongering,
105280	107520	which once again, both sides are guilty of.
107520	108800	Let's talk about that.
108800	113120	I could talk about Obama's speech, but I do like to bring some variation to this channel.
113120	117520	So first we have Michael Gove, who claimed that voting to stay in the EU
117520	119680	would be like voting to remain hostages.
119680	121600	I have many criticisms of the EU.
121600	125200	One of them, however, is not that they are holding us at gunpoint.
125200	129360	Then we have good old George Osborne, my favourite chancellor,
129360	133120	using his university degree in modern history to demonstrate that he knows
133120	136880	sweet fuck all in economics, claiming that mortgage rates may rise,
136880	139200	that income tax may increase.
139200	142560	But he's not in control of those rates, so he can't be sure.
142560	147120	However, my favourite indirect attack has to be this delicious pick
147120	149920	from everyone's favourite newspaper, the Daily Mail,
149920	153440	who talk about how Obama replaced the bust of Winston Churchill
153440	156240	in the White House with that of Martin Luther King.
157040	158400	Wow, what a disgrace.
164400	165840	Changing furniture.
165840	168720	You'd have thought that it was his fucking house.
168720	171120	And bring it back to the George Osborne point,
171200	172720	it's another thing that pisses me off.
172720	174560	Everyone speaks in conditionals.
174560	175760	Something may happen.
175760	176720	This might happen.
176720	177600	That might happen.
177600	178320	You know what?
178320	181920	The day after the EU vote, David Cameron may defect to the BMP
181920	183600	and become a vegan stoner.
183600	184400	That's the thing.
184400	189040	As long as you put May before something, you can say anything that could potentially happen.
189040	194320	It's this classic media tactic employed by everyone who is remotely influential
194320	196320	and it's pissing me off.
197520	200400	And people don't want to know what may happen.
200400	202640	People want to know what will happen.
202640	206880	And the fact that the public are not aware of this information is a failing of the media,
206880	211360	who are more interested in reporting on the latest Conservative Party civil war
211360	214240	rather than the actual motions of leaving or staying.
214240	217040	And I've looked up a lot of information and even read a book.
217040	218240	Yes, me.
218240	219520	I read a fucking book.
219520	220800	I don't even read books, mate.
220800	222800	So you know how important it must be then.
222800	225360	But that's because I'm a twat with too much free time.
225360	226240	I can do that.
226240	228480	If you're a parent working full time,
228480	231840	then I'm sure you'd love to have the time to do some in-depth research on the EU,
231840	233040	but you just don't have it.
233040	237840	All you hear is the same fear-filled rhetoric without engaging in any meaningful debate.
237840	240960	And that's what we really need in a vote so decisive.
240960	243600	So I can't see this one causing any controversy.
243600	244720	What do you think?
244720	248240	Please let your imagination run wild and comment what you want.
248240	250880	As long as it doesn't breach the YouTube guidelines, that is.
250880	252800	Apart from that, have fun.
252800	253600	Get creative.
253600	265440	Anyway, on the right hand side.
