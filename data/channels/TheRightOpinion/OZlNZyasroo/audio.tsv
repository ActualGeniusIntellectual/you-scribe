0	14280	I've made a lot of mistakes. There are many things I wish I could take back. But I cannot
14280	24280	grow if I refuse to see myself for who I truly am.
24280	27560	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
27560	31480	too much free time, and my free time has been delightfully occupied by what will be
31480	37080	the person at the centre of today's final video. It is not necessarily something I've
37080	41600	found myself enjoying too much, but one must finish what he hath started, and I have to
41600	46520	admit, in spite of everything, all the other videos, and all the information, I definitely
46520	50960	underestimated the undertaking this topic would require, and even then I will be undoubtedly
50960	55280	disappointed that I have not been able to cover every single corner, look at every one
55280	60720	of his crap films, look at his books, see what's between the lines, maybe one day I
60720	67480	will return, but that day is not today. Even with every private video, every deleted tweet,
67480	72680	every single redacted statement, Onision has given me more than enough to work with, more
72680	77800	than I'd like, to be honest, and today we shall be closing that off in style. Although
77800	82600	not a requirement, I would recommend watching the previous videos to have a contextual grip
82600	85560	of what we lead into today.
85560	90560	A lot of what we've observed is, on the surface, the product of putting your life online. Onision
90560	95120	has, in a way, created his own story through the medium of YouTube, and I've often wondered
95120	100120	if Greg himself sees his life like a movie, one where he plays the main character, one
100120	104680	where he can be this role model to other people, this tortured individual, always on the line
104680	109120	between good and evil. I mean, we saw that in his little cult project, he had this dark
109120	114020	and light theme, and this sort of line between them, but the thing is, you can't easily manufacture
114020	119240	such a character unless you're a real artist, and the problem was that Greg clearly integrated
119240	123620	a lot of his own personal investments into this character, a lot of strange desires that
123620	128480	didn't merely involve him, and ultimately led to many people being hurt. Movies are
128480	132760	often movies for a reason, we may idolise some characters, we may even see parts of
132760	137840	ourselves in the worst people, but self control is a necessary constituent that should be
137840	142460	exercised, especially when you're a public figure with great responsibility.
142460	146720	The way that Onision had cultivated his audience gave him an even greater responsibility than
146720	151320	many creators, because his audience were highly committed to him as a personality, and would
151320	156160	likely be heavily influenced by his behaviour. He had carved out this corner on the internet
156160	161360	that was relatively isolated from reality. Onision was never interested in responsibility
161360	165520	though, and over time, he had managed to isolate various people who bought into his doctrine
165520	170280	more closely, and did for a significant amount of time, whether by luck or by judgement,
170280	175240	get away with it. As mentioned at the end of last video, by September 2019, the tides
175240	179280	were beginning to turn, instigated by many people, but brought forward by a person named
179280	184640	Sarah primarily, arguably the most concerning example of the people he involved in his life.
184640	188540	A lot of people at this point had already been dunking on Onision, he was a popular
188540	193120	target that accumulated views, but this was what finally pushed many people over the top
193120	199000	with their criticisms, and it went from look at this dude to look at this dude. These criticisms
199000	203300	have mostly amounted to focusing on his predatory behaviour, although there are many actions
203300	207680	that shouldn't be ignored either. Regardless of what he says, Onision pays close attention
207680	211320	to the drum that revolves around him, pays close attention to the videos being made on
211320	215560	him and knows what's being said about him, and this often leads to questions being asked
215560	219520	of him by his fans, and he has often responded to them. As noted, some of these responses
219520	223160	are for the better, sometimes these responses are for the worse. One of the things that
223160	226800	you will hear on a fairly repetitive basis is how honest he is.
226800	232400	There's a reason people call me the most brutally honest YouTuber, it's because I f***ing am,
232400	236960	I'm the most brutally honest popular YouTuber, hundreds of thousands if not millions of people
236960	240520	know me to be the most brutally honest YouTuber.
240520	245240	Now if that isn't a guy you can trust, I don't know who is. He'll have this assured tone
245240	249380	in the way he speaks, and he'll often speak about setting the record straight, he'll express
249380	253300	a confidence that will likely soften those who are willing to give him the benefit of
253300	258340	the doubt. He also often uses words and phrases that portray his honesty in an exceptional
258340	263420	light. Yeah guys, I'm an honest YouTuber, must be a surprise round here. Those sorts
263420	266760	of narratives are not just designed to show himself in a positive light, but show his
266760	271300	critics in a negative one. After all, if he's really the person telling the truth and laying
271300	275700	down the law, how are you meant to believe anyone else? These are all classic tactics
275700	279660	that have led him to be relatively protected by his most devoted audience. Another tactic
279660	283260	that he has developed over the years was creating conclaves of the internet where he could have
283260	287620	control over what's being said about him. For example, you look up videos on Onision
287620	291460	on YouTube in the last few years, and they wouldn't be the most positive. However, go
291460	295900	over to his numerous websites whose domain changes every few months, and you may find
295900	299980	a consensus more devoted to defending him. In a way, his Patreon was probably one of
299980	304160	the best examples of this. Patreon is a nice way for many creators to make buck when Susan
304160	309240	isn't feeling as generous. However, by creating a paywall, Onision creates a dilemma for his
309240	312620	critics. They can pay to see what's going on behind the scenes, see what Onision is
312620	316880	chatting and thus criticise it, and bring that content to the public eye, but then again,
316880	320840	if it's nothing particularly substantial other than Onision being Onision, you're paying
320840	324960	money into his Patreon, you're financially supporting him, so you might want to leave
324960	327840	it, but then you don't know what he's up to, and it might be worse than one thinks, and
327840	331920	he might need to be stopped. That's ultimately the concern of many of these platforms, and
331920	336600	exactly how, for a long time, he has to control a proportion of his fanbase. We'll discuss
336600	340500	the fate of his Patreon very soon, but this has always allowed him to capitalise on the
340500	344720	drama in rather derivative ways. For example, when testimony started coming out regarding
344720	349000	him around September time, he'd release these videos with very vague, ambiguous titles,
349000	353560	and most of it was rubbish, rambling, monetised rambling I must add, which were purposely
353560	357920	vague to remain monetised. Even with all this criticism, all this stigma, nothing mattered
357920	362480	as long as he had fans, and he was making money, those two factors will always keep
362480	367300	him buoyant. So how was this deconstructed, and is there still more to do? Join me today
367300	372400	in this final instalment, The Fall of Onision, where we document what went wrong, what went
372400	377560	right, and at what point I can go back to sleeping at night. Let's dive right in.
387920	392800	The first step to holding someone to a decent
392800	396720	account is publicity. Now honestly, after the year that's been, the sheer inertia that
396720	400720	many people are understandably experiencing, that's a harder job than most. I don't think
400720	405120	people really wanted to have to deal with another case. Nonetheless, Onision had the
405120	409680	attention of his previous actions which followed through onto today's situation. As noted in
409680	414080	my first video, I think Onision's behaviour was visibly irrational, in a way to make sure
414080	419040	that his audience was isolated in their commitment to him. In the past, his rather awful behaviour
419040	423960	seemed purposefully attention seeking, particularly when he was making commentary on other creators.
423960	427680	He knew what he was doing, and he wanted their attention, and for many people, you don't
427680	432400	want to necessarily feed that. It was a running fact that videos on Onision would get more
432400	437260	than actual Onision videos, and that in a way, it might be better to not make videos
437260	441360	on him at all, because you're so obviously punching down and just giving him the attention
441360	445620	that he desires. Although I agree with this to an extent, I'd also defend people who
445620	449480	criticised him because of the fact that he did already have an established fan base,
449480	453880	and I'm not sure if more people would be indoctrinated by him than people who disconnected
453880	458280	from him due to this run in criticism. I noted that many of these fans were probably captured
458280	462600	in his narrative at quite a young age, and as they mature and become a bit more conscious
462600	466520	of the flaws in his narratives, it might help seeing the additional videos calling him out
466520	471280	on those. There are three general basic ways when you interact with someone's content.
471280	475680	Negative attention, negative attention, and no attention. The goal in the past was to
475680	480200	make sure he didn't really receive any additional attention outside of what was necessary, to
480200	484320	hold him to account for his bogus content. In the last few months, the perspective has
484320	489000	split, and the goal has now been to shine negative attention on his actions. Overall,
489000	492480	the momentum has been gathering. Multiple new creators have been covering the topic
492480	496720	with fresh perspectives and commentary which engages new audiences. There were many accounts
496720	501920	set up to completely document his actions, providing accessibility to content creators
501920	505960	to pick up the story quickly, thus spreading the word further, and they deserve their kudos
505960	510240	too. Nonetheless, attention on this scale only really matters if you can bring about
510240	514360	real systemic change, and there are always gonna be some people attached to Onision no
514360	518480	matter what. Commentators are helpful, but their scope is limited, and it could very
518480	523720	easily fizzle out. However, it hasn't stopped there, in fact, there was one more twist to
524680	529000	The final character I want to introduce to this is someone by the name of Chris Hansen.
529000	534200	Chris Hansen was famous for his MSNBC show To Catch a Predator, which aired between 2004
534200	539640	and 2007. Now, this show wasn't overly successful then, and actually had its fair share of controversies,
539640	543840	but it has enjoyed a cultural resurgence in recent years due to the many, many memes,
543840	548220	but also the relevance to a platform like YouTube with many predators on there too.
548220	551480	Now identifying this relevance over the last few months, Chris Hansen has been setting
551480	555720	up shop on the platform, and hosting his own streams where he discusses cases of online
555720	558080	predation with various victims and creators.
558080	562200	Chris Hansen Good evening everyone from New York City, I'm Chris Hansen, and this is
562200	566840	Have a Seat with Chris Hansen, live on my YouTube channel, Have a Seat with Chris Hansen.
566840	572620	So thanks for tuning in, we have a very special guest tonight, as you know we've been kind
572620	578320	of exploring this whole world of predator behaviour, whoops I said predator, I'll get
578320	585520	back to that in a minute, on YouTube specifically having to do with a YouTube sensation named
585520	588920	Onision, whose real name is Greg Jackson, we've talked about it.
588920	592920	Now the medium that Chris Hansen was operating on now was one where you could reach him much
592920	597680	more directly, and eventually with the momentum, he would have been a fool to ignore the case.
597680	601640	To many people, Chris Hansen was a blessing of his own, him covering the case would provide
601640	605560	a lot more mainstream interest due to his leanings, and the fact that he transcends
605560	609840	the stigma that many creators have of just being a YouTuber, he can exert influence in
609840	614560	areas that others may not be able to, even if he doesn't have a huge number of subscribers,
614560	619160	he's a media figure, he holds clout on his own terms, and this sort of clout was well
619160	621660	served in the streams that he conducted.
621660	625280	It's hard to pick on specific details, but if you watch them, it gives people a platform
625280	629640	to talk about their own experiences, and allows investigations to be conducted in a relatively
629640	631760	safe and professional environment.
631760	636120	It's important that they're somewhat careful, as publicising certain information can compromise
636120	640480	future legal processes, however, on the other hand, the attention that Chris Hansen has
640480	645560	provided may be able to kickstart investigations that have more scope and power to work out
645560	647480	what's going on behind the scenes.
647480	655900	I did have a conversation with the FBI yesterday, with the breaking news here, and obviously
655900	662400	there was evidence that some of the young women have that could very well be of interest
662400	664420	to investigators.
664420	673500	And contact is being made within the Bureau, between the different field offices involved
673500	680260	here across the country, including Washington State, where a lot of this activity took place.
680260	688500	But again, a reminder that even though Greg Jackson, Onision, Kai, apparently were very
688500	693660	careful about ages in terms of having young women visit, sexual relations, and everything
693660	700460	else, what many people in these cases don't know, don't think about, aren't aware of,
700460	708660	is that the transmission of sexually explicit pictures of people younger than 18 is a federal
708660	709660	crime.
709660	714460	It can either be enticement, it can be the transmission of child pornography, it is a
714460	718020	penalty which carries a sentence of 10 years per image.
718020	721660	If it's a video, it's 10 years per frame.
721660	731020	So there is a very good chance that there's going to be a criminal investigation here,
731020	734980	and we will keep everybody posted on this.
734980	738540	This is not all sunshine and rainbows though, as Hansen and his team, most notably Vincent
738540	741660	Nakotra, has come under severe criticism for their practice on YouTube.
741660	745780	We're all aware that this generation may be a bit more out of touch, and Chris Hansen's
745780	749980	boomer eye contact doesn't lie, but as observed by many, it appears that Vincent's abusive
749980	754980	power of copyright striking, doxxing, and scamming goes beyond naivety, and for a significant
754980	759780	amount of time, Chris Hansen's decision to keep him on in spite of this seemed ill-advised.
759780	763460	There are other videos that document this more comprehensively, such as Mr. Gee-Gees,
763460	765260	which I would definitely recommend watching.
765260	769420	Now let me make it clear, Chris Hansen's videos have an invaluable place in this case,
769420	774340	however the greater good cannot excuse abuse of power, and such behavior could easily compromise
774340	777460	what you've been working for, and it may well have already.
777460	781940	You guys should not be giving Vince a pass because you don't want to derail the Onision
781940	786600	investigation, because people not addressing this, and continuing to allow Vince to be
786600	792140	a loose cannon, will be the ultimate derail to this investigation, but that's just my
792140	793140	opinion.
793220	797140	At the start of January 2020, Chris Hansen stated that he would be reviewing Vincent's
797140	801240	conduct, and a few weeks later he announced Vincent's departure from the show, most likely
801240	805560	due to the information that Vincent had mishandled Sarah's laptop with possible implications
805560	808140	to the subsequent legal admissibility of it.
808140	811340	Although there was some suspicion whether Vincent has actually been sacked, lack of
811340	815220	new information prevailing, benefit of the doubt will be provided on that front, however
815220	820120	the damage may have already been done, though I sure hope not, I may well be saving the
820120	822180	rest of this for a video of my own.
822220	826940	And with that serious caveat in mind, I want to turn the attention back to Onision.
826940	830900	The mounting of the narrative against Onision, particularly in the past few months, has given
830900	835100	him even less control on YouTube than before, however this hasn't stopped him from attempting
835100	838460	to prevent the narrative from spreading, he's still uploading regularly, and we'll go
838460	842460	into the details of those videos soon, but although the like-dislike ratio is enabled,
842460	843700	the comments are not.
843700	847700	I can't tell you Onision's exact reasoning for this, though he did make a video on it,
847700	851840	but not sure I'm gonna buy his explanation, however if I was to guess, I'd say it's
851840	856000	because if you show a strong dislike to like ratio against you, you can rustle up a narrative
856000	859800	that you're the victim of mob mentality to the people who may be sympathetic towards
859800	863340	you, while disabling the comments will prevent people from being able to rationally justify
863340	867440	their criticism or dislike of you, there were many people who said in the past that Onision
867440	870680	deleted comments that were critical of him, chances are that the volume of the comments
870680	874720	became too much control or filter, and the positive comments were so rare anyway, it
874720	876080	just wasn't worth filtering.
876080	880440	Actually, little update here, now that hate is gearing down, he's turned the ratings
880440	884580	off and restored comments while filtering them, which allows him to present the perspective
884580	888280	that he is on the comeback, gaining support and healing people with the facts, we'll
888280	893060	indulge in that in a bit, but he can be very sneaky sometimes, old Onision.
893060	896800	Now of course, there were other creators who spoke out about his content, and their comment
896800	901040	sections were completely open for people to express their feelings, but often an Onision
901040	905820	devotee wouldn't watch those videos, or go into those videos with an open mind at least,
905820	909520	and even then Onision would regularly claim and strike down videos that were critical
909520	913480	of him, partly because of the narrative, and partly because of the money, nonetheless,
913480	917360	he couldn't take them all out, or even Team YouTube, in all their oblivion, would probably
917360	920440	pick up the fact that he's up to no good.
920440	924400	Onision was clearly overwhelmed in this regard, there was nothing that he could do to halt
924400	929300	the stream of content documenting his misgivings, but this was only part of the battle, people
929300	933400	who had never really liked him on YouTube anyway, that dislike had just manifested into
933400	938560	a much more active hatred, so Onision was still relatively unharmed, but that was about
938560	939560	to change.
939560	947480	I've destroyed most every relationship I've had with other YouTubers by being rude towards
947480	948480	them.
948480	952400	I am a self-made pariah.
952400	956760	As said, at the start of this drama, Onision was uploading these very smug videos, but
956760	961840	he knew it was coming, but he was at least trying to prepare for it, I noted in my previous
961840	966400	video that he had started indirectly attacking Sarah by stating that people with BPD had
966400	967520	a troubled memory.
967520	973040	But in March, he uploaded this fantastic video, warning people about the power of fake screenshots.
973040	977080	It's about the most important thing that is ruining people's lives right now.
977080	978080	Fake texts.
978080	982600	Fake screenshot texts make up 99% of all texts.
982600	985840	That's a fake fact, and that goes to show you how fake it can get.
985840	989840	So anyway, Snufflepuff has been accused of r***ing murder at my f***ing station.
989840	990840	Um, what?
990840	996380	Oh, I panda-god with no beard for some reason, maybe I was too lazy to find it, have screenshots
996380	997380	on panda-god's phone.
997380	1000380	Oh, I guess it's true then, no one can fake screenshots.
1000380	1001380	Yes!
1001380	1006380	Time to ruin Snufflepuff's whole life based on these entirely authentic screenshots.
1006380	1011300	Alright, so now you guys know, what you see online, the screen caps of like, you know,
1011300	1015220	whatever celebrity people target next or whatever, they're probably fake, okay?
1015220	1019660	It's all probably total lies, run by people who have absolutely no life, who are total
1019660	1022900	liars, frauds, f***ing losers, etc.
1022920	1026700	Now, I would argue that fake screenshots can be extremely destructive, and I would always
1026700	1031060	advise against them, if there are fake screenshots, then it's important that they are called out
1031060	1032060	when necessary.
1032060	1036140	However, this seems much more like a way to once again try and implant ideas into his
1036140	1040900	audience's mind before the storm, that his accusers would not be credible.
1040900	1045100	He knew this was coming, and instead of setting the record straight when he had the opportunity
1045100	1050060	to, he puts out these half-truth videos, because he's smug, and he thinks that can work.
1050060	1053460	You know, all those moments in villain videos, right?
1053460	1057040	Those movies when they're like, you and me, we're not so different.
1057040	1058040	That's because they're not.
1058040	1063740	The villain is just like the hero, they're both focused on the same f***ed up toxic s***.
1063740	1066500	It's bouncing around their heads, pretty much the same.
1066500	1070780	They're in the same universe, they're barely even opposing forces.
1070780	1075660	The hero is just the guy who hasn't f***ed up yet, and then become the enemy of the public,
1075660	1078220	and then turn villain by the public.
1078220	1079660	That's how easy it is.
1079660	1083700	His smugness continued into the drama, as noticed his videos would have some titles
1083700	1087860	to imply he'd be revealing something, and then boom, he'd hit you with 15 minutes
1087860	1092100	of unrelated codswallop or existential bollocks, or more of the same stuff that would just
1092100	1096340	vaguely call out people in an attempt to discredit them, while not actually saying anything of
1096340	1097340	real substance.
1097340	1103180	Sup y'all, I have become the bread and butter of a lot of people's dopamine kicks and their
1103180	1104180	actual income.
1104180	1108380	My favourite video prior to the meltdown, though, is one by the name of It's Over,
1108380	1111100	a more direct response to some of the allegations.
1111100	1114900	He once again picks out various posts that weren't really representative of people's
1114900	1120220	interests, speaks in a very general language, and including my favourite, if we were guilty
1120220	1123780	we'd be in jail defence, which is an interesting one for sure.
1123780	1127780	It's like I said, if the things that people said about Kai were true, then he would be
1127780	1128780	in jail.
1128780	1133100	It's so easy, just walk into the police station, you have, you know, something that's open
1133100	1138540	and closed, obvious, right, allegedly, so, and I feel like, you know, Kai's been proven
1138540	1143540	innocent, yet nobody cares, and the proof of innocence is the fact that you have someone
1143540	1147060	who open and closed said a horrible crime occurred, and said that they actually went
1147060	1151880	to court, their friend said they went to court, and yet Kai remains a free person after they
1151880	1153060	actually went to court.
1153060	1157300	He does show some evidence in this video, but I think he actually sneakily twists things
1157300	1158300	around.
1158300	1162060	For example, he talks about one person who was caught lying and doing illegal drugs,
1162060	1166820	seemingly referring to Billy, but then shows screenshots which were dated around 2012,
1166820	1169620	far before Billy, and therefore that must be Shiloh.
1169620	1172860	He then follows that up with his comment and corroborating evidence,
1172860	1178380	Another person was broken up with for literally taking money from me to survive in Canada
1178380	1182740	while actively sleeping with another person that I didn't know about, and they got pregnant
1182740	1188060	with that person's baby, okay, so I was like funding their livelihood, and they were actively,
1188060	1189980	like that's another reason I dumped somebody.
1189980	1194060	This is obviously a reference to Shiloh again, so he's just shown evidence that twice makes
1194060	1198340	a case against Shiloh, but acted like he's spoken about two different people, thus trying
1198340	1202620	to create this sentiment that he's got tons of evidence against so many people, against
1202620	1206020	all of his accusers, when really he's just challenging one of many.
1206020	1209940	I will say that the whole payment charade is a bit of an annoyance, but at the same
1209940	1214500	time Shiloh had already admitted this, and I think many people were aware that she hadn't
1214500	1215500	paid Greg.
1215500	1218760	You can argue whether that was the right thing to do or not, but I don't think it necessarily
1218760	1223420	compromises the claims of mental attrition that Shiloh had been asserting, although Greg
1223420	1225240	seems to think it does.
1225240	1229760	I personally disagree, I personally believe that Greg invested monetarily into these people
1229760	1234240	to create that sense of loyalty, as if he deserved something back, and I think with
1234240	1237760	the living hell that Shiloh appeared to go through, he got it back.
1237760	1243140	As for his other accusers, well, Greg isn't legally allowed to talk to them due to NDAs.
1243140	1247600	This isn't impossible, as he has tried to have other people sign NDAs, but then he really
1247640	1250680	should sue, that's what NDAs are for.
1250680	1255400	There's a legal agreement with someone that I can't talk about why I dumped them, that's
1255400	1259280	why I haven't talked about a lot of things, it's because I actually respect legal agreements
1259280	1263880	in that regard, so I can't talk about that other reason, but I also, you know, there's
1263880	1264880	other reasons.
1264880	1270280	Unfortunately, some people don't respect those agreements, and it's weird, because if they
1270280	1273720	don't respect a legal agreement, you know, where they publicly acknowledge something
1273720	1277860	was signed, how can you respect anything they say, something that they admit to having
1277860	1281800	agreed to, which, you know, if you've ever seen Judge Judy, all you have to do is admit
1281800	1286040	it happened, and then it becomes valid, like, have you ever heard of a verbal contract?
1286040	1290140	If you admit to making even a verbal contract, you could be held accountable in court.
1290140	1294040	But he's not actually going to be suing anyone, because he's not that kind of guy.
1294040	1298220	Good old gracious Greg doesn't do it for the money, despite asking thousands of dollars
1298220	1301800	just for an interview with a news outlet, and making copyright claims on multiple videos,
1301880	1304160	but we don't talk about those examples.
1304160	1307920	However, speaking about copyright claims, he bites back against those as well.
1307920	1309560	Let me talk about copyright claims.
1309560	1313860	So there was this chick who said that she was pursuing me for copyright claims.
1313860	1318680	She was very upset, because she got copyright claims on a video where I think two or three
1318680	1322660	of my songs were in it, maybe less, maybe more, but she said she was going to sue me.
1322660	1327520	And so she took your guys' money, and she flew out here, and she went to a concert,
1327520	1329180	and then she went home.
1329180	1330420	That's the story I was told.
1330420	1333860	That's how serious the people are who talk about copyright claims and me.
1333860	1339180	You have a person who literally took part in literal fraud right in front of you, and
1339180	1340900	yet claiming to be the hero.
1340900	1345820	So he's suggesting here that the point about copyright claims are invalid because people
1345820	1349460	got scammed by another person using that talking point.
1349460	1350460	No.
1350460	1351660	No, Greg.
1351660	1353600	It does not invalidate it at all.
1353600	1355060	There are crappy people around.
1355060	1359380	Doesn't mean you have a right to be claiming videos unjustly, which is what you have been
1359380	1360660	doing, I must add.
1360660	1365820	Onision regularly reiterates that these situations are quote, one of many examples, and yet it's
1365820	1370440	hard to think in multiple instances of any other clear examples that prove his point,
1370440	1372780	anything that can build on what he's trying to prove.
1372780	1376680	He also accepts Sarah's invitation to use various posts of information against her,
1376680	1379100	and trying to use it to once again invalidate these claims.
1379100	1384420	And that's what's interesting, is nobody respects or, you know, sees the fact that
1384420	1386620	I actually obey the law.
1386620	1391540	Like, you got a list of people who, you know, take part in doing illegal drugs, committing
1391540	1395460	crimes in general, uh, like fraud, and they do all these things, and yet they wind up
1395460	1398380	being the heroes, which is a mind-boggling thing to me.
1398380	1400420	Guys, isn't it amazing?
1400420	1406100	All these people doing drugs, and yet I'm being called a child groomer, whoo, doesn't
1406100	1410520	quite logically stack up, and with mine to my previous video, it seems possible that
1410520	1414080	you deliberately coerce people into these positions to use it against them in the future,
1414080	1416960	but I think that ploy is becoming very transparent now.
1416960	1420800	Throughout the rest of this video, he mainly shows screenshots only from Shiloh, from around
1420800	1421800	2012.
1421800	1425840	He rebuts a couple other claims, such as the idea that he looked up Netjunator's photos,
1425840	1429720	which he said was public content anyway, I still find it kinda weird he made that whole
1429720	1434400	video about her, but he ultimately finishes stating that he's not controlling, not oppressive,
1434400	1437620	but he is manipulative, and do you know why he's manipulative?
1437620	1439680	Because everyone is manipulative.
1439720	1446560	Manipulative, everyone is manipulative, everyone, and you guys don't realize it, but you are.
1446560	1448880	You're manipulative in the way that you take a position on anything.
1448880	1454120	For instance, if you are a supporter of Trump, you will automatically view facts as different
1454120	1456520	than everyone else, because you have that bias.
1456520	1457960	Bias makes us manipulative.
1457960	1462160	But I feel like I'm dealing with a bunch of people who just wanna see me fail, so they're
1462160	1464260	not gonna hear anything I just said.
1464260	1466880	They're just gonna hear the part where I say, everyone's manipulative, and they're gonna
1466880	1471640	be like, oh, well, he admits it, he's manipulative, and it doesn't become a human conversation,
1471640	1476000	it just maintains as a ridiculous, outraged culture, reactional thing.
1476000	1479200	Well, let's keep that in mind as we go into the next part.
1479200	1501060	It's Over was mainly a video aimed at attacking Shiloh for some nondescript reason.
1501060	1505340	Even when he's dealing with other allegations such as the ones that Kaiser Groomer, most
1505340	1510440	notably advocated by Sarah, he immediately turns it on Shiloh, and about her fake miscarriage.
1535340	1550620	I'm not gonna defend those actions, I'd argue that such behaviour could cause a lot of upset,
1550620	1555660	but once again, as a response, it's logically ineffective, first because Shiloh was clearly
1555660	1560220	mentally unstable at that point, and this was less than a whole month after the whole
1560220	1564660	Shiloh Forgot Me debacle in which you highlighted how unstable she was, and that doesn't really
1564660	1569900	change the reliability of a modern day accusation, other than the fact that she may misremember
1569900	1574320	it, it certainly doesn't affect her credibility as a proponent, in spite of the claims that
1574320	1578900	she is a quote self-admitted pathological liar, something that I found very little evidence
1578900	1584140	of, bar your own math, and secondly, and most importantly, because Shiloh isn't even the
1584140	1603020	main proponent of this narrative.
1603020	1608300	But ultimately, what I think sums up this video best, is this scrappily organised point,
1608300	1612900	where he talks about someone sending an email to Kai, warning him about Greg, but then shows
1612900	1617700	an image which I think is meant to be an email from someone attacking Shiloh, he obviously
1617700	1622740	forgets to censor her name once, despite doing it throughout the rest of the email, oopsie,
1622740	1627020	I don't even know what he's on at this point. This is the sort of explanation that
1627020	1631480	Onision knew would only fly with the loyalists, but those were the people he was appealing
1631480	1637220	to, he didn't even expect viewers to read the damn text. Onision was smug as all hell,
1637220	1641020	his responses were rubbish, but they showed an arrogance that he felt untouchable, and
1641020	1645260	he was allowed to be slightly sloppy on the details as long as people didn't care, he'd
1645260	1650260	do these mocking tweets of Chris Hansen, he was provoking people, and they reacted, however
1650260	1654420	as noted, the attention was slightly more committed at this time, and our good friend
1654420	1657420	Sir Onion was about to be taken down a peg.
1657420	1661580	This all started on the 21st of November, when he was informed that he was under investigation
1661580	1666500	from the FBI, he uploads a video basically having a meltdown, it's just him falling
1666500	1671740	apart on camera, making nonsensical comments, personally speaking, it's not the most enjoyable
1671740	1672740	watch.
1672740	1691900	Now we'll talk about legality in due time, but there is a more pressing situation to
1691900	1696020	talk about, and that was obviously the fall of his Patreon. Onision was still making a
1696020	1699680	decent amount of money from his Patreon, most likely from people who had forgotten
1699680	1704140	to stop donating, maybe some people had died, I don't know, he's been on the platform
1704140	1709020	long enough, but whatever, that paywall was a significant power play that enabled him
1709020	1713940	to make content and control a narrative in a place where he wasn't as wildly hated,
1713940	1718300	it also gave him a small amount of individuals who were more devoted for him. This was probably
1718300	1722940	what made him so chipper, that thought of constant income, however with the public pressure
1722940	1727420	and the serious authority behind this public pressure, Onion Man should have been a little
1727420	1731940	more careful. Why is this? Well apparently on the 24th of November, he decided that it
1731940	1736440	would be a good idea to post text from Billy. Okay, well it's been a fairly consistent mud
1736440	1740440	slinging contest between all parties, you can't be surprised there, so he posts the
1740440	1745040	text with the captions alongside stating that even if you were a liar, it didn't justify
1745040	1748860	his cruel behaviour. It once again gave me the impression that he was just trying to
1748860	1752780	stay one step ahead of the allegations while trying to discredit other parties, however
1752780	1757620	foolishly Onision posted an image that included Billy's phone number. Now many have alleged
1757620	1761620	that this was done to inspire harassment, and to be honest, I wouldn't put it past
1761620	1765340	him, but the tweet was deleted not too long after. Nonetheless, the post was up there
1765340	1769540	long enough for people to bring Patreon's attention to it. Patreon have a habit of looking
1769540	1773780	for a reason to ban people they don't like, and honestly, out of everything he has done,
1773780	1777460	this probably wouldn't be the top of the priority list for many people, however this
1777460	1781940	was the most concrete act of wrongdoing that Patreon could identify, and even though it
1781940	1786620	was on another platform who didn't actually act on it themselves, Patreon shut Onision
1786620	1788180	down, and that did not go well.
1788180	1797340	Onision Wow. Wow. Wow. So you guys are so into yourselves, like you are so committed
1797340	1803100	to censoring innocent people, that you're just gonna go and try to get my Patreon deleted
1804020	1807820	He very quickly uploaded this video called Wow, which once again, contained the somewhat
1807820	1812740	unstable ramblings of an individual who clearly was upset that his Patreon had been removed.
1812740	1816460	Now on principle, I would say that some of the rules have been a bit bent to achieve
1816460	1820780	this specific result, but as a component of the greater situation, then there's no real
1820780	1824780	doubt he should have been removed. Patreon was a real way that he could easily use to
1824780	1828620	find more loyal individuals, isolate them in the way he seemed prior, and he's been
1828620	1833460	called out for this again, and again, and again, and he has not learned, and therefore
1833460	1837300	they should be questioning his ability to hold the platform at least, and probably removing
1837300	1838300	it altogether.
1838300	1841300	Of course, Onision didn't really appreciate this line of reasoning.
1841300	1850300	Onision You tried to do the FBI, it didn't work! You tried to do the police, it didn't work!
1850700	1858700	So instead, he resorts to the paycheck, and you got it! You got it!
1858700	1860700	But he doesn't have to appreciate it.
1860700	1864940	As said, I'm unsure of the outcome of an FBI investigation, but regardless of whether there
1864940	1869140	ends up being an actual criminal conviction or not, does not mean no wrongdoing has been
1869140	1870140	committed.
1870140	1873460	I've covered many people whose behaviour I would class as rather inexcusable, but that
1873460	1878140	does not mean they've conducted anything criminally illegal, and given the testimonies that say
1878140	1882460	Onision has a way of working around the law, it makes sense he'd use this defence.
1882460	1886980	Onision's video itself is also interspersed with rather erratic behaviour, spontaneous
1886980	1889340	screams, and mood swings galore.
1889340	1893340	It's certainly a spectacle, in fact, this pattern of behaviour has been repeated continuously
1893340	1898660	in his uploads, to the point where various users have been setting up Onision Bingo.
1898660	1902180	Over the videos following the deletion of his Patreon, he documented multiple events
1902180	1906400	that seemed to worsen his standard of living, for example, Kai was seeking the dissolution
1906400	1910440	of the marriage, he was having to sell all his belongings, he was being kicked out of
1910440	1912840	his apartment, he was losing everything.
1912840	1918240	But why on earth was this all happening, and what do I really think is going on?
1918240	1924840	A large part of why I'm so active online is to keep the attention of others so I feel
1924840	1928200	not only appreciated but retain a false sense of value in myself.
1928200	1934080	In reality, I'm socially abrasive, emotionally conflicted, and despite my inflated ego, I
1935080	1944240	Onision is not a regular person, I don't think you need a behavioural expert to tell
1944240	1948320	you that, and his breakdown videos exhibited content that wouldn't be expected from a
1948320	1953660	rational being, however many people hypothesized at the time this was all an act, and rightfully
1953660	1954660	so.
1954660	1958440	It's purpose, though, is unclear, although some have stated that it might be so he could
1958440	1961720	plead insanity if any cases actually went to court.
1961720	1965680	Now I don't know if that was the case, but I had my own little theory for exactly what
1965680	1966680	was happening.
1966680	1971040	We have this situation, and we now know that this drama is different from the rest, this
1971040	1975160	one is having more of a profound effect on people's pockets, and that is obviously
1975160	1979920	going to upset Onision here, so the fact that he's pissed off is natural, but as noted
1979920	1981360	it doesn't stop there.
1981360	1986000	The one thing that Onision has always wanted were views, it's always been about views,
1986000	1991640	views make his world go round, and when watching this saga of videos, one clip always stuck
1991640	2003320	out to me, and that's the thing, in a way, it is exactly what people wanted, people
2003320	2008740	who are likely upset, angry, and indignant about what Onision has done want to see him
2008740	2012040	pay, and Onision was giving the people what they wanted.
2012040	2015840	For me, it's not exactly what I wanted, I will obviously talk about what I wanted in
2015840	2020040	due course, but I'd bring attention to the fact that many of these videos still managed
2020040	2021040	to be monetised.
2021040	2025440	Now, many of Onision's uploads since this time follow a similar structure, they start
2025440	2029720	off with him behaving in a relatively calm manner, and then after a minute or so, devolve
2029720	2033160	into this insanity that people clearly find the most entertaining.
2033160	2034160	Why is this?
2034160	2038160	Well, it's likely because if you submit a video for manual review when it gets demonetised,
2038160	2043000	the reviewers will not watch the whole video, they will most likely analyse the title, thumbnail,
2043000	2045640	description, tags, and maybe watch the first minute.
2045640	2049520	Of course, if they watch for an amount and see Onision behaving in a relatively calm
2049520	2052560	manner, they are more likely to leave the video monetised.
2052560	2058080	Also note how Onision was using vague, ambiguous titles, and not ones that are outwardly inflammatory,
2058080	2060760	giving the algorithms as little to pick up on as possible.
2060760	2065040	I personally believe that this run of uploads was a ploy to make money, that may not be
2065040	2068700	true, and I wouldn't necessarily urge people to say it as a truth, but I would make the
2068700	2073280	statement that with this in mind, it's still clear that he wants the attention.
2073280	2077160	In one of his videos, shortly after he claimed to have been kicked out of his house, he asked
2077160	2079160	audience this question.
2079160	2081160	What if I am mentally ill?
2081160	2083160	What if I'm sick?
2083160	2085160	What if I'm mentally ill, huh?
2085160	2087160	What if?
2087160	2089160	Okay, then you're making fun of a handicapped person.
2089160	2090160	Do you understand that?
2090160	2094160	And I want to clarify, I didn't find this funny, I didn't find this particularly amusing,
2094160	2097160	I found it rather uncomfortable, I think a lot of people did too.
2097160	2103280	I often found Onision interspersing this insanity with a narrative, one of blaming others for
2103280	2105740	reacting to him behaving in such a way.
2105740	2109580	Now for the record, I think you have to be sensitive around people acting like this,
2109580	2114500	but at the same time, this doesn't mean you forfeit all responsibility for your actions,
2114500	2119500	and if I aim to look at your situation from the most cold, detached perspective, the conclusion
2119500	2122180	remains the same, you shouldn't have a platform.
2122180	2127500	Onision also intertwines these videos with self-promotion and plug, such as Onisionfans.com,
2127500	2132100	which appears to be a redirect to the subscription page for Uh Oh Bro, another mess that we will
2132100	2134260	have to place under the microscope soon.
2134300	2139500	He mentions at one point he has a cameo too, which he does, and he's charging a meaty 60 dollars
2139500	2143500	for gigs on that, which some people have actually taken him up on. Delightful.
2143500	2147500	As you guys may or may not know, I have a cameo, and um...
2147500	2152220	This newer set of videos, although erratic, also seem quite organised, and with the intent
2152220	2154060	to promote his other content.
2154060	2158220	This didn't mean he was mentally well, it may mean that the problem still persists behind
2158220	2159220	the scenes.
2159220	2163360	In one of his newer videos, simply called Dissolution, another video that is still monetised
2163400	2167240	on writing this, he states that his husband Kai has filed for the dissolution of their
2167240	2168240	marriage.
2168240	2171840	It follows a similar formula, he talks about it, stays quiet for a bit, and then has another
2171840	2173480	episode in the car.
2173480	2178460	Of course, the document was completely fake, so that went nowhere, but suddenly he's sleeping
2178460	2182600	in a box with apple juice he obtained, then he has to stay in a cheap hotel, and then
2182600	2186360	he's in a cupboard, and it's all your fault.
2186360	2198280	So I guess all those videos where people are saying that I'm the final fall, and that
2198280	2202280	my life is over, and I've gone to a new low, and I'm so pathetic.
2202280	2206600	At the time, I didn't believe the circumstances that he was portraying, and I believed it
2206600	2211280	was an attempt in part to pander to the people who hate him, and in part to try and turn
2211280	2213040	blame and criticism onto them.
2213040	2217120	The interchange between this narrative and the insanity, which was meant to be the evidence
2217120	2222880	of his instability and his suffering, a lot of people were tuning in for that, but honestly,
2222880	2226680	with this all in mind, that should not be the focus, when I was watching these videos,
2226680	2230560	it was easy to lose track of what happened in the first place, but you go and look back
2230560	2235120	on what he's done, and the fact that he's lost his Patreon has to be somewhat detached
2235120	2239680	from his reaction, and people should make sure it is detached by not necessarily feeding
2239680	2240780	this content.
2240780	2245280	His narrative focused on the fact that people keep talking about him, and he wanted people
2245280	2249160	to focus on that, and how little control he claimed to have.
2249160	2253400	The general principle of proportional punishment is something that should stand, people like
2253400	2257620	to see others face consequences for what they've done, but not to an extent that may hurt them
2257620	2258620	beyond their actions.
2259620	2266620	I live in a tent, and you guys are sitting there going, we're so much better than him,
2266620	2275820	he's a loser, look at him, this helpless person, who has no chance of defending himself, ever!
2275820	2280320	Onision was trying to show the punishment he's faced was disproportionate, and brought
2280320	2284620	on by mob mentality and cancel culture, when in reality, all that he has lost thus far
2284620	2289580	directly from his critics were his Patreon, a consequence that I and many others would
2289580	2293820	argue is fair enough, and suddenly because he's losing this, he was out of a house,
2293820	2296680	his spouse was divorcing him, he was losing everything.
2296680	2300800	Some people believe this, but most people doubted him, pointing out the wetland environment
2300800	2305140	he was thinking, or the stock divorce document, so eventually in the new year he made a video
2305140	2308500	called Hi, stating that it was all actually an act.
2308500	2313540	He then made another video talking about how he wishes people would cover the real issues.
2313540	2316700	What you have here is cancel culture in a nutshell.
2316700	2318140	You have the source of it.
2318140	2322060	If you have an algorithm that promotes what people want to hear, and doesn't promote
2322060	2326100	what they don't want to hear, you have a propaganda machine.
2326100	2329780	You don't have a machine that promotes the truth anymore, you don't have a machine
2329780	2339140	that promotes what actually happens, you have a machine that panders to the most immature
2339140	2344680	and difficult to respect aspects of human selfishness.
2344680	2349320	We establish the idea that Onision has three main goals, to frame himself as the victim,
2349320	2352500	to distract from serious allegations, and to farm views.
2352500	2356660	Chances are he'll keep rotating these ideas while altering the tone and delivery, providing
2356660	2361040	the illusion that he is presenting something new, but I doubt anything new of value will
2361040	2362040	be said.
2362040	2366220	This is exactly how I would describe his recent run of uploaded responses, which is this endless
2366220	2370780	stream of content, where he talks very vaguely, splits it purposefully up into multiple videos,
2370780	2372940	and uploads it on a nauseatingly regular basis.
2372940	2378180	Many of these videos are practically unwatchable, and include him providing almost purely anecdotal
2378180	2382660	evidence and ad hominem attacks in an attempt to discredit his critics, while also making
2382660	2385060	some very bizarre comments himself.
2385060	2388860	So when you have people who are attracted to 18 and 19 year olds, you're talking about
2388860	2393580	people who are attracted to people who are at the premium age for breeding, and that
2393580	2395500	is on a scientific level.
2395500	2401160	So we like to social justice warrior shame people for being attracted to people who are
2401160	2405620	actually at the premium age of breeding, which is 18, 19, and if you want to be outraged
2405620	2409020	by science, that's fine, be outraged by science, be an idiot.
2409020	2412780	On top of the monetary motivation of so many uploads, and the copyright claims he can probably
2412780	2417280	file, Onision knows how to make an efficient response video, and to me, is purposely stretching
2417280	2421080	these videos to try and make his critics just give up on him, bring us to the point where
2421080	2425420	he can turn around and say, see, these people didn't watch my responses, how can they respond
2425420	2426420	to me anymore?
2426420	2430300	Fortunately, there have been people out there actually responding to these videos and pointing
2430300	2432180	out some of their problems.
2432180	2436120	Recently Onision made a video where he shows quote receipts, some people have questioned
2436120	2439840	whether they are real or not, but for me, I assume they are, because they're pretty
2439840	2440840	weak.
2440840	2444540	A fair portion of the video are texts from Sarah telling Kai that he's not a groomer,
2444540	2449900	which judging from the few messages that are dated, land around 2017, 2018, and the start
2449900	2451320	of 2019.
2451320	2456020	Sarah was publicly defending Kai at that point regardless, and everyone knows that, so what
2456020	2457200	is his point here?
2457200	2458480	I'm not entirely sure.
2458480	2463640	At one point he claims that these DMs are Sarah attempting to groom Kai, which I don't
2463640	2467800	really see and I've looked at it like ten times now, maybe it's because I'm on two hours
2467800	2468880	of sleep, I don't know.
2468880	2473840	He also makes a brilliant, fantastic point where he shows a message from Kai accusing
2473840	2474840	Billy of lying.
2474840	2479180	Here we only see Billy's very brief immediate response, and I cannot say whether there was
2479180	2482940	a more elaborate response that followed, at this point Greg then shows alternative
2482940	2488240	DMs of Billy saying she holds a grudge, before Onision then claims that as she's admitted
2488240	2493980	to lying, I guess, and given the fact that she has a grudge, she must be lying now.
2493980	2498620	Now you don't need a logical genius to debunk this claim, the average person lies during
2498620	2502720	the day, it's just people lie on different levels with different gravity.
2502720	2507900	The grudge wouldn't have helped, but a grudge doesn't necessarily mean a lie, and regardless,
2507900	2511780	Billy's claims were quite mild, probably the mildest, just about how it was a really
2511780	2516620	messed up dynamic, and how temperamental your behaviour was, where she backed up with some
2516620	2520540	pretty compelling evidence, more compelling than yours, she admitted in her tweet that
2520540	2522300	she wasn't fully in the right.
2522300	2526540	Yeah, you're going for her credibility, but I don't know what you discredit like this,
2526540	2530540	unless you're seriously implying that because someone lied to you about smoking weed, that
2530540	2535220	some evidence-based claims and some other rather mild claims are invalidated.
2535220	2540600	Not satisfied with one, Onision then uploads another video where he talks more about Sarah,
2540600	2545120	in between showing DMs that he claims as evidence against the notion that Kai sent news to Sarah,
2545120	2549460	which I personally find uncompelling, and using a Venmo situation in which Sarah was
2549460	2554900	involved in against her, which was quite poorly handled, to be fair, basically he gets really
2554900	2559600	mad, right in the middle, calling everyone stupid because Sarah's blooper video is
2559600	2562900	so clearly fake, because of obvious reasons.
2562900	2566840	You guys are so stupid, so so stupid.
2566840	2570260	You didn't even notice that her hair is a different length.
2570260	2571540	Did any of you notice that?
2571540	2577100	Her blooper video, which she recorded months after the first video, while telling all of
2577100	2581980	you that she recorded it the same day, different hair length.
2581980	2583500	How could you people miss that?
2583500	2589820	You are so stupid, and she's already proven without a doubt guilty of being a slanderous
2589820	2590820	liar.
2590820	2595140	I just wanna say, I am really tired at this point of Greg and his BS.
2595140	2599540	Firstly, the video uploaded onto Onision's channel clearly has a lighter filter, and
2599540	2602900	has light from a different angle which would explain colour differences, unless she's
2602900	2604420	made her beanie brighter too.
2604420	2608180	Sarah actually mentions this herself, in a tweet where she explains she added a filter
2608180	2609520	to hide the emotion.
2609520	2613460	It's hard to tell the length of the hair because of the angles and the fact that she's
2613460	2615660	changed her position with regards to the beanie.
2615660	2619800	Sarah's brunette hair comes round her cheeks, while the blonde goes down her shoulder.
2619800	2622280	This is recognisable in both the videos.
2622280	2625960	It's hard to spot on the Onision upload, and it's hard to see where it starts and
2625960	2630840	ends because of the lighter filter, and the fact that it's position is adjusted a little,
2630840	2634080	she's moved it back, but you can see it, especially when it moves.
2634080	2638600	Now, I'm not saying that this proves the video is real, but moving room, trying to
2638600	2640920	compose yourself, adding a filter, plausible.
2640920	2645680	Also, if we wanted to talk about receipts, because Onision loves proof, in one of the
2645680	2650000	first texts released by Sarah, you can see a cut off text where Sarah says she's having
2650000	2652680	a rough time with regards to making this video.
2652680	2657000	Once again, not definitive proof, but do not let Onision trick you into thinking this is
2657000	2661240	some open and shut case where he gets to be all mad at your gullibility when he knows
2661240	2663640	damn well the alternative explanations.
2663640	2668800	This situation isn't simple, he is trying to express anger to convey certainty, it's
2668800	2670400	textbook emotional manipulation.
2670400	2673480	This is not a gotcha moment, he is just an actor.
2674000	2679440	Listen, I can't respond to every one of Onision's videos, as fun as it would be, I'm sure
2679440	2685040	this isn't his last, but making other people out as bad won't make you good, and I'm
2685040	2689200	not here to argue that everyone involved is good, I probably wouldn't end up being a
2689200	2694420	fantastic human being either if I had to endure Onision, there are videos out there more focused
2694420	2698400	on his accusers, and you can make that judgement for yourself.
2698400	2703460	My main quarrel is, and will probably always be with Gregory, I even left a comment on
2703460	2707180	the video highlighting my problems through a throwaway account.
2707180	2711260	It disappeared immediately, I assume he's got a filter on, I do not know if it's up
2711260	2715540	at the time of recording, what I do know is that right now the comments left are almost
2715540	2720060	universally positive, so he's definitely using some sort of filter currently, and as
2720060	2723860	well as that, it feels like he's trying to keep attention on his other channel to
2723860	2725860	distract his critics.
2725860	2728140	What is he trying to distract people from?
2728140	2729140	Let's find out.
2733460	2737260	I do not expect to be embraced as if this is all okay, and my unhealthy social attitude
2737260	2744140	is somehow acceptable, it's not, feeling relief from forgiveness is for those who possess
2744140	2748540	faith, I am not one of those people, I cannot be forgiven.
2748540	2752860	I don't like what Onision is doing, even if I am sensitive to his mental state, I don't
2752860	2756280	think he should have a platform to do it, this doesn't mean I agree with everything
2756280	2760380	that people do in response, people should be relatively careful, for example in a recent
2760380	2764300	video called Baby Carrot, he rants about people who've allegedly mocked his penis
2764300	2766420	comparing it to a baby carrot.
2766420	2769660	Now this is a new one to me, but let's just take it for an example.
2769660	2775780	In this video, for a brief moment, he flashes his quote, baby carrot, and some people notice.
2775780	2780620	Now to be fair, the main goal of people who reacted to this was to report it for pornographic
2780620	2784840	content, which was within their rights, but once again Onision removed this very quickly,
2784840	2788760	and then, a few days later, uploaded another video where he complains about this.
2809760	2814080	Once again, it seems like an exaggeration, as actually, I couldn't find too many posts
2814080	2818680	about it, but I'd argue that these quote blunders are being done for two purposes,
2818680	2823420	firstly to emphasise victimisation, and secondly to make sure people stay distracted, because
2823420	2827680	although some people may take pleasure in his Patreon being deactivated, and all these
2827680	2832100	subsequent antics, they provide nothing of substance, and nothing that really aids the
2832100	2833960	allegations beyond that.
2833960	2838200	Ultimately, it does not circumvent the full problem, I do wonder if he wants people to
2838200	2842180	think he's losing everything so they take an eye off him, but that is far from the truth,
2842180	2844540	which is where we'll turn our focus now.
2844540	2848820	When I made my video around this time last year on DaddyOFive, I said what they'd done
2848820	2853260	after being kicked off YouTube was isolate their remaining audience and make content
2853260	2857580	for them on a separate website, it allowed them to still function above criticism, and
2857580	2860700	ultimately there was very little that could be done about that.
2860700	2865140	Now Onision being widely hated may be seen as a victory for some, but it also means that
2865140	2870300	once again, people can be easily isolated if he ceases to use platforms so openly.
2870300	2875140	For example, at the end of his videos currently, he shows this, an end card, with the inscription
2875140	2880540	of Onisionfans.com, in the bottom corner you will see some names, now it took me a moment
2880540	2884340	and a search to understand what these names represented, but they were the new subscribers
2884340	2889140	of Onisionfans.com, and by the most recent video he has a significant amount of names
2889140	2890440	on the end card.
2890440	2894300	Of course, in many of these videos he cries about how few supporters he has, but that's
2894300	2896620	certainly not a number to be sneered at.
2896620	2899100	Okay, but how much are they donating?
2899100	2901060	Petty cash won't make much difference at this point.
2901060	2904860	Well, I had a gander at this reward scheme after clicking on the link myself, and to
2904860	2909700	have your name in the credits at the end of a video, you need to be donating the equivalent
2909700	2911820	of 35 pounds a month.
2911820	2916900	Now 35 times to all these people is a significant amount, I must add a caveat that the number
2916900	2921700	of people included in the credits increased significantly following one specific video,
2921700	2925420	so I don't know if he updated it for that month, or if he just started including people
2925420	2929500	who were donating less, but either way, he is making a fair amount of income.
2929500	2933740	On his Discord server, the members rank has at least 50 people, and that's only the people
2933740	2935180	who I've seen online.
2935180	2939740	The minimum donation is 5 quid, so it's fair to say he's at least making a few hundred
2939740	2944320	quid a month on this medium alone, that's obviously excluding all the YouTube videos
2944320	2949060	he still has up and monetised, even the old ones which are still getting hits.
2949060	2952880	I'd also like to add that people who are concerned about the elite tiers may have decent reason
2952880	2954540	beyond the amount of money it makes.
2954660	2959860	For two tiers, he advertises one on one calls with the man himself, firstly on Discord for
2959860	2963800	those who are willing to pay, and then on Skype for the real high rollers.
2963800	2967340	You know the medium in which he connected with a lot of his former accusers?
2967340	2972140	Only highly committed fans are likely to be willing to pay for something as pricey as
2972140	2975940	that, and as mentioned, those are the sorts of people that Onision will be targeting.
2975940	2979900	Now I don't know if Onision is willing to take his chances at this point, but given
2979900	2982880	his track record, I don't think there's a chance that platforms should be willing
2982880	2983880	to take.
2983920	2987800	You may all be clowning on Onision on his main channel, but I don't believe he's
2987800	2990000	as down on his luck as he portrays himself.
2990000	2994040	I know it sounds messed up that people would be into him at this point, and even vulnerable
2994040	2998700	to his antics after all these exposed videos, but some of the most messed up people had
2998700	3002320	hordes of fangirls, you just don't know what people are into.
3002320	3006680	I think he wants to give people a false sense of security that they may have justice at
3006680	3010720	one point in the hope that the criticism, and the calls for YouTube to deplatform him
3010720	3011760	may lay off.
3011760	3015360	He thinks if he can portray enough suffering, then people may become bored.
3015360	3016880	I think that is quite foolish.
3016880	3020720	People are aware of the prime source of his income, and most notably power.
3020720	3024800	Even if Onision was making no money from YouTube at all, people would still want his channel
3024800	3028560	removed because it's not about the money, it's about the power.
3028560	3033620	Even the subscriber count, and the fans alone, will provide him with some level of that.
3033620	3037720	Many days during these quote breakdowns, he conducted these very casual streams with his
3037720	3041600	donors that are completely accessible at the time to the public, though they have been
3041600	3042600	privated since.
3042600	3046640	And although it's easy to frame him as if he's falling apart as a person, especially
3046640	3050640	with the recent deletion of his Patreon, I'd also say that by doing that, you give your
3050640	3054360	audience a false sense of accomplishment, when really, from my judgement, there are
3054360	3059600	a lot of exceptions here, and he's still using the situation to build something else.
3059600	3063600	And even if he has lost everything, then it should make these ventures seem more precarious
3063600	3067060	in many ways, because then you're dealing with someone who has much less to lose and
3067060	3070020	will act more desperately to obtain those goals.
3070020	3075300	Onision appears to be slowly closing off from the world, and granting people exclusive access.
3075300	3080060	Publicly, it looks like he's doing awfully, but if less people can see what's going on,
3080060	3082980	well, the problem is self explanatory at that point.
3082980	3084580	But I don't think it's that.
3084580	3086020	Don't fall for the bait.
3086020	3090220	This video has been primarily focused on his response, but I'm also telling you that you
3090220	3094700	don't want to become too focused on one element on this story alone, because you risk falling
3094700	3098660	out of touch with what he's actually done, and there are plenty of videos documenting
3098660	3102620	that, earlier instalments of my own included.
3102620	3108540	Onision had been invited on Chris Hansen's show, and demanded $350,000 to go on.
3108540	3113260	He also demanded $10,000 from a news outlet for an interview, and he's asking for a subscription
3113260	3116180	fee to be able to speak in a Discord chat.
3116180	3119900	He may not be here for a long time, but it won't stop him attempting to make a quick
3119900	3121660	buck off the attention.
3121660	3123460	Stay aware of that.
3123700	3126700	And with this in mind, let's move on to the next part.
3129700	3132660	When you're a YouTuber, it's basically like the most narcissistic job in the world.
3132660	3133900	Hey, everyone, look at me.
3133900	3137580	You have never, and probably will never encounter a more real YouTuber.
3139300	3141540	I've pretended to be such a good person for most of my life.
3143220	3146740	I've been trying to convince myself I'm a hero, and in reality, I'm just the most foolish
3146740	3149140	person in the world with a version of yourself that doesn't exist.
3153460	3161700	I don't really want to take too much focus away from what Onision's done, though it
3161700	3164460	is important to analyse his responses as well.
3164460	3168260	Since this drama has arisen, he has contacted various parties involved with the good old
3168260	3174860	guilt trip email, message, or Skype to explain in actuality how disappointed he is with them,
3174860	3179040	often speaking on behalf of Kai, too, who has been seldom seen since the initiation
3179040	3180040	of this situation.
3180240	3184840	It's the sort of condescension that pervades his attitude, the idea that actually, he's
3184840	3189400	so ashamed that people are coming at him in such a way, sometimes he'll be nice to you,
3189400	3194320	talk about a connection he thought you had, he'll even place himself under you to grasp
3194320	3195320	power over you.
3195320	3199920	It's an attempt to maintain a character that he envisions himself as having, this guy who
3199920	3204760	is in control of everything, who knows exactly what's going on, still under the impression
3204760	3208640	that if he can talk to these people in a certain way, he can make them listen.
3209640	3214560	There are so many responses by Onision at this point that it becomes nauseating, each
3214560	3219180	with their own failure to actually talk about what's being said and done, and that's because
3219180	3224100	the evidence is stacked incredibly deep, there is no real way you can respond without attempting
3224100	3228520	to discredit your accusers, to watch him flail in these responses seems to be some sort of
3228520	3229520	poetic justice.
3239120	3244480	What I've learned today, ours get away with their crimes in part due to people who are
3244480	3247600	too cowardly to report them to the police.
3247600	3251320	Your husband responds, guess I'm to blame.
3251320	3256620	Your response, I blame everyone who's ever been violated, not just on the violators,
3256620	3259720	but those who keep their crimes a secret.
3259720	3261140	You earned that.
3261140	3265460	Someone tells you that when people go to a specific location at a specific time of day,
3265460	3269660	they are always hurt, and you decide to go to that location at the specific time of day
3269660	3275460	and you get hurt, do you think it would be fair to say you were asking for it?
3275460	3280880	What about women and men who decided to go home to abusive relationships, relationships
3280880	3286700	where they are regularly beaten, do you think they're asking for it?
3286700	3291460	I'm sure there are a thousand scenarios that I'm not considering, but for all the ones
3291460	3294980	I am, it's pretty undeniable that they are.
3294980	3300180	When you look back at his previous comments, his strange tweets, his behaviours, Onision's
3300180	3304700	philosophy does seem to be one of control, but it also seems to be one where he speaks
3304700	3307020	ill of the people that he is controlling.
3307020	3311180	As noted, he has regularly spoken about how abuse victims almost share responsibility
3311180	3316500	for not speaking up, and now people are speaking up, finally doing what he has preached.
3316500	3321540	I feel if he was a man of his word, he'd have some grudging respect for his fate, but
3321540	3325820	he doesn't, and that's because he's not what he envisions himself as.
3325820	3330940	He's a coward, he's a money grabbing coward, in his head he might see himself as some supervillain
3330940	3335060	who makes people bow to his motives, and for a while he may have done that, but at the
3335060	3340100	end of it all, he's just a loser who pursues people who lack both physical and mental power.
3340100	3343620	Now he's putting on this show because he thinks he can create some greater narrative
3343620	3345260	about cancel culture.
3345260	3349620	There is little cancel culture here, Onision has continued to instigate in a way that will
3349620	3352820	provoke a reaction, and then frame it as self-defence.
3352820	3357340	Only a few weeks ago he filed two civil lawsuits against Chris Hansen and Repzion, the latter
3357340	3361340	simply for its continuous coverage of Greg's channel and Ms. Diving's.
3361340	3365260	Chris Hansen turned up at his house, and although you could say it was overkill, it didn't seem
3365260	3366260	dangerous.
3366260	3377940	These cases were obviously dismissed.
3377940	3381420	The strange detail comes about in the fact that Onision appeared to dismiss the case
3381420	3382420	himself.
3382420	3385540	Although there are theories circling around this, in another new video Onision confirms
3385540	3389500	he will be pursuing greater legal action against Repzion, I guess we'll just have to keep an
3389500	3390500	eye on him.
3390500	3394100	I'd also like to note that in Kai's statement, he says that Repzion has been harassing them
3394100	3399300	collectively for over 10 years, which would once again make Kai 15 upon the initiation
3399300	3403500	of this alleged harassment, which, although probably a deliberate lie to attack Repzion,
3403500	3407380	is unbelievably bad optics that backfire when you consider them.
3407380	3411340	Oh, and also Onision sued the wrong Chris Hansen.
3411340	3412340	Nice one, Greg.
3412340	3416160	I'd also add that it was funny he decided to claim all his insanity videos won't act
3416160	3420060	just before he filed the lawsuit, some real coincidence there.
3420060	3423900	Nonetheless, it's clear that given these examples, he will jump at any opportunity to
3423900	3429580	turn some perhaps excessive attacks into pure victimhood, and I would urge caution
3429580	3432940	with that in mind, for many reasons.
3432940	3436580	Firstly because, as mentioned, that is his narrative, there should only be one goal in
3436580	3440940	my opinion for his channel, and that should be termination, or at least removal of the
3440940	3443620	power to upload new content as it is.
3443620	3447740	That does not need to be achieved by harassing him, or anyone else, that can be done by making
3447740	3451740	a formal appeal to YouTube, putting serious pressure on them, and illuminating what he
3451740	3452740	has done.
3452740	3456660	Secondly, because in spite of his and Kai's actions, there is a family involved.
3456660	3460280	Given one of his clips has him shouting at kids in the background, many have questioned
3460280	3462180	his ability to be a parent.
3462180	3465780	Without greater context, nothing's going to be happening in that regard soon.
3465780	3470820	Thirdly, and probably most importantly, we do not know how far he's willing to go to
3470820	3472100	prove his point.
3472100	3475780	At this stage, it seems like he's trying to conjure up this story, and the moment that
3475780	3479300	people give that to him, then he could do something terrible.
3479300	3481500	Don't let him do that, and pin it on you.
3481500	3485780	People love to troll individuals who are widely hated, it's cathartic, it makes people feel
3485780	3490180	like they're providing some form of citizen's justice, but it's not conducive.
3490180	3495820	Don't let him compare himself to Etika, he is not in the same cosmos as him.
3495820	3500080	His victims have the right narrative, respond to what he says directly, bring attention
3500080	3503700	to the situation, remove his power.
3503700	3508340	I don't think Onision has a place on YouTube, from everything public, even the videos he
3508340	3512620	made public himself, it's clear there is something deeply broken about him.
3512620	3516900	From the 60 plus videos he made on Eugenia Cooney, to the documenting of suffering and
3516900	3521820	abuse within his own relationships in an attempt to stir up drama, to unlawfully claiming and
3521820	3525860	even removing videos that provide critical commentary on him.
3525860	3530980	It's all ground enough to reconsider his position on the platform, but the most prominent point,
3530980	3534740	and this is the one that I have stressed in the past, is the fact that as long as he has
3534740	3539580	the power, and a way to attract people who are willing to validate and defend this behaviour,
3539580	3544020	which although small is significant enough, there will always be people who unfortunately
3544020	3546340	allow themselves to become targets.
3546340	3550700	In the wake of new harassment rules, which in my opinion have gone completely overboard
3550700	3555740	in the censorship of content, such as Leafy Content Cop, and Yoko Naru's video vigilante,
3555740	3560380	amongst many others, the fact that YouTube, in spite of the almost overwhelming flood
3560380	3565420	of complaints and evidence against Onision, and how he has used this platform to obtain
3565420	3570940	power and use it in this way, the fact that they have the audacity to turn a blind eye
3570940	3572460	is unbelievable.
3572460	3577220	YouTube is still his most powerful medium, even if he has a fraction of the fans that
3577220	3578220	he had in the past.
3578220	3583100	Don't let him sucker a new victim in, because you want to protect your revenue flow, it's
3583100	3584100	not worth it.
3584100	3587820	I don't know what will happen by the time this video is out, if his channel is gone
3587820	3591940	then so be it, but the argument remains the same for anyone in this position who has used
3591940	3597380	their power to contact individuals far beneath their age and solicit activities that many
3597380	3601060	would view as morally wrong, whether he's legally culpable or not.
3601060	3605660	In fact, the only other time I have seen the channel shut down under predatory circumstances
3605660	3609580	was Austin Jones, and I'm convinced that was only because he was literally convicted
3609580	3610940	of child porn.
3610940	3616660	However, as said, Onision has a reputation for being strangely meticulous regarding laws,
3616660	3621740	now maybe people themselves are saying that Onision and Kai could be legally held to account,
3621740	3626860	and so I've decided to bring my legal eagle or swan in, John Swan, to have a look at these
3626860	3631540	accusations and see if there's any chance of a case being brought against Onision or
3631540	3633300	Kai in the future.
3633300	3634780	Take it away my friend.
3634780	3638500	This isn't going to be a very popular segment, and that's because the things I'm about to
3638500	3642500	present to you are probably not what you want to hear.
3642500	3647220	This topic has been one of the most stressful, aggravating and tedious topics that I've ever
3647220	3649540	had the displeasure of encountering.
3649540	3652020	Onision is not a good person.
3652020	3656480	In fact, he is most likely a disgusting and repulsive human being who uses his position
3656480	3660380	of power to prey upon younger girls that don't know any better.
3660380	3665460	Not only that, but he is most likely an abhorrent but charismatic bully who abuses his partners
3665460	3667780	both mentally and physically.
3667780	3670360	In other words, a piece of shit.
3670360	3672180	But you already know that.
3672180	3675020	So when is he going to jail?
3675020	3676380	Uh, yeah.
3676380	3677380	About that.
3677380	3681420	I want to preface this segment by making it clear that I do not support Onision in any
3681420	3682980	way, shape or form.
3682980	3686720	I'm going to be critical of Chris Hansen and the way that he's gone about his investigation
3686720	3690440	throughout this segment, but being critical of the way an investigation has been carried
3690440	3693460	out is not the same as supporting Onision.
3693460	3695860	I just want to clarify something before we start.
3695860	3699620	People have constantly been framing Onision as a groomer.
3699780	3704740	Okay, groomer has been a popular response to his tweets, but unlike the UK, Australia
3704740	3708580	and many countries in Europe, grooming is not a crime in the US.
3708580	3713380	It is perfectly acceptable for a 16 year old to move in with a 30 year old, not to have
3713380	3718260	any sexual relations and to have sex with them on the day after they turn 18.
3718260	3721220	It's really bloody creepy, but it's perfectly legal.
3721220	3725060	You need something a lot more substantial than that to get a conviction.
3725060	3729520	Throughout this segment, I want to put focus on one word in particular, evidence.
3729520	3734960	To convict anyone of any crime, you need a lot of evidence.
3734960	3739480	Evidence is sometimes hard to come by because it can't just be a person saying what happened.
3739480	3740600	That's not evidence.
3740600	3741600	That's a testimony.
3741600	3745820	And in order for a testimony to be proven accurate, correct and admissible, there needs
3745820	3748720	to be cold hard proof to back it up.
3748720	3751040	So where is the proof?
3751040	3756040	Now if you've been following this situation, your mind likely went straight towards Shiloh,
3756040	3761120	who allegedly has videos archived originally uploaded on Onision's channel, documenting
3761120	3763600	Onision's abuse towards her.
3763600	3768080	Any competent criminal defense lawyer would have many things to say about these videos
3768080	3770120	being admissible in court.
3770120	3773320	First of all, there's the issue of Onision's content itself.
3773320	3777360	Much of it is not to be taken seriously and could be classified as satire.
3777360	3779960	So why would these clips be any different?
3779960	3783800	At the end of the day, it's just one person's word against another.
3783800	3787240	That's not to say I don't believe Shiloh, but I'm trying to be fully objective here,
3787240	3791440	erring on the side of caution, because that will be the lens of the court system looks
3791440	3792880	at this from.
3792880	3796280	Courts generally err on the side of caution when it comes to making decisions, since they
3796280	3800760	don't want to hand out a wrongful conviction, and I'll try my best to maintain that position
3800760	3801760	throughout this segment.
3801760	3803880	Anyway, back to the videos.
3803880	3808640	So there's the problem of Onision's backlog mostly consisting of content that is satire,
3808640	3811500	but then there's also the logical arguments to be made.
3811500	3815860	If these were legitimate clips of Onision abusing Shiloh, why would he upload them for
3815860	3817940	millions of people to see?
3817940	3820600	It just makes no sense to the outside world.
3820600	3824940	The courts don't care if Onision is apparently insane, he doesn't have any medical diagnoses,
3824940	3828800	and a psychological assessment will likely bring back results that he is just a normal
3828800	3830460	functioning human being.
3830460	3834700	However insane Onision might be, I have no doubt in my mind that he is capable of acting
3834700	3839420	completely sane and more than able to fool any surface level psychological assessment
3839420	3842180	that might go on when going through the court system.
3842180	3846620	So all in all what I'm saying is that these videos will likely not be admissible in court
3846620	3850380	due to the nature of them and the content surrounding them, so we'll definitely need
3850380	3854380	a bit more than this if we are going to convict Onision of anything.
3854380	3859300	A better chance to get him on in regards to Shiloh would be under statutory rape.
3859300	3863540	Shiloh has stated that Onision had sex with her when she was 16.
3863540	3868300	According to her, he travelled to her state, Pennsylvania with the age of consent at 16,
3868300	3870980	he booked a hotel room, and they had sex.
3870980	3878460	This is illegal under Title 18 of the U.S. Code, Section 2422, Coercion and Enticement,
3878460	3883820	which carries a maximum jail sentence of 10 years or 20 years depending on the crime.
3883820	3888320	This sexual relationship is also illegal under Pennsylvania's age of consent laws.
3888320	3892460	In this state, two people between the age of 16 and 17 can consent to have sex with
3892460	3896160	each other, but not to someone aged 18 or older.
3896160	3901640	So if this happened, there are two counts to get him on, but there's just a slight
3901640	3902880	issue here.
3902880	3906460	Onision said it didn't happen.
3906460	3908540	So how do you prove it did?
3908540	3912560	CCTV footage of the supposed hotel would be long overwritten by now.
3912560	3916560	You could show evidence in the form of text messages that Onision was arranging for sex
3916560	3919960	at a hotel, but they would have to be able to be verified.
3919960	3922200	Does Shiloh even still have the phone?
3922200	3925800	If she doesn't, most phone companies wouldn't keep her back up, and even if they did, would
3925840	3929440	probably not comply with the FBI as Apple has done in the past.
3929440	3934060	Screenshots are not enough, given how easy it is to fake messages in Photoshop nowadays.
3934060	3937440	You can even hack into phones to make a text say whatever you want to say.
3937440	3939940	With Android, it's extraordinarily easy.
3939940	3942440	With Apple, it's a bit harder, but not impossible.
3942440	3946040	If both the recipients were using iPhone, they would automatically be using iMessage,
3946040	3950380	which is encrypted on both ends, meaning that not even Apple can read the messages.
3950380	3954720	The same goes for WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, and Kik claims they delete messages as soon
3954720	3958600	as they're sent, so subpoenas of these apps is not an option.
3958600	3962400	I'm not sure what phone Shiloh had at the time, but any criminal defense lawyer would
3962400	3965320	have a field day with all these discrepancies.
3965320	3968160	I could go on more, but I'm not going to bore you with the details.
3968160	3971560	At the end of the day, it's Onision's word against Shiloh's.
3971560	3976040	The fact that Shiloh has a history of mental illness probably doesn't help her case either.
3976040	3979460	Any criminal defense lawyer would argue that if Shiloh is not in the best of state when
3979460	3983580	talking with Onision, that her evidence and statements should hold much less weight in
3983580	3987220	court or even that her statements should not be heard at all.
3987220	3991500	Again, I'm sorry if I'm being cynical, but I'm erring on the side of caution here.
3991500	3995420	You really need something super duper daring to get a jury to achieve a unanimous verdict
3995420	3996420	in court.
3996420	4000060	So I'm just trying to put all these accounts under scrutiny.
4000060	4005820	A lot of Chris Hansen's investigation had more to do with Kai than it did with Onision.
4005820	4010260	Sarah's argument in relation to Onision had to do with him grooming her, which isn't illegal
4010260	4011820	as I stated before.
4011820	4015300	I've seen the argument of power of attorney thrown around a lot.
4015300	4019280	That is, Onision couldn't have sexual relations with Sarah, even though she was within the
4019280	4022820	age of consent at the time because he provided for her.
4022820	4027540	He put the food on the table and in many respects, he was her legal guardian of sorts.
4027540	4032060	Now the issue with this argument is the power of attorney stops becoming a valid point when
4032060	4033780	you turn 18.
4033780	4036340	When you're 18, you're an adult and you can make your own decisions.
4036340	4041140	For example, a teacher is said to have power of attorney over a student in school.
4041140	4045380	In many states, it is illegal for someone who has power of attorney to have sexual relations
4045380	4050100	with someone who is under the age of 18, even though both parties may be within the age
4050100	4051100	of consent.
4051100	4055860	But when you turn 18, you can have sex with anyone you like, including teachers at your
4055860	4056860	school.
4056860	4057860	Is it creepy?
4057860	4058860	Yes.
4058860	4059860	Will that teacher lose their license?
4059860	4060860	Yes.
4060860	4061860	But is it illegal?
4061860	4064460	Not in criminal court, maybe in civil court under malpractice, but that doesn't apply
4064460	4065460	here.
4065460	4068780	So realistically, what do we have left?
4068780	4072780	At the moment, the arguments against Kai are looking a whole lot more convincing than
4072780	4075020	the arguments against Onision.
4075020	4078860	There have been accusations of child pornography specifically to do with Sarah that have been
4078860	4080660	thrown out against Kai.
4080660	4085380	Sarah allegedly had a laptop and phone originally belonging to Kai that had illegal pornography
4085380	4088480	on it that was supposed to be sent to the FBI.
4088480	4093260	Chris Hansen told her to send it to this guy, Vincent Nicotra, who's a scam artist and professional
4093260	4096020	cry baby under Chris Hansen's name.
4096020	4100100	Vincent had stated that Chris Hansen told him to await further instructions, but further
4100100	4101980	instructions never came.
4101980	4105600	It was just sitting in this guy's New York apartment for months.
4105600	4109420	Any criminal defense lawyer would have a field day saying that this evidence should not be
4109420	4111800	admissible for obvious reasons.
4111800	4116700	The amount to which this investigation has been absolutely botched is insane to me.
4116700	4118220	Chris Hansen is not the police.
4118220	4121460	Hell, Chris Hansen isn't even an investigator.
4121460	4123260	He's just an interviewer.
4123380	4127360	While his TV show is running, Hansen never did any of the behind the scenes work himself.
4127360	4129720	He merely interviewed the predators.
4129720	4132980	He had a whole team of professionals helping him.
4132980	4136900	And now here's this guy, which he fired and a lawyer accused of sexual assault in the
4136900	4140180	Michigan Supreme Court and also named in the center of a fraud scheme.
4140180	4142100	Good choice of people there, Chris.
4142100	4145020	Hansen has put a false sense of hope into these girls.
4145020	4150260	He set himself up to be the hero in this big story, the big man who is going to take Onision
4150260	4152480	down once and for all.
4152520	4155960	But I just don't think this is the case.
4155960	4157320	And neither does Sarah.
4182480	4189320	Because putting my faith in them to do it was not the correct move, obviously.
4189320	4192960	What these ladies did coming out into the public eye under all this scrutiny in the
4192960	4197740	world in front of millions of people must have taken some intense balls.
4197740	4202160	And they're all extremely strong for having come out with their stories against Onision.
4202160	4207640	I support the victims 100%, but that doesn't mean I can cherry pick the truth and tell
4207640	4209280	you what you want to hear.
4209280	4213040	I'm not going to do what Chris Hansen has done for months now and put a false sense
4213040	4216680	of hope into anyone who might have been affected by Onision.
4216680	4221040	Because what he's done may be disgusting, repulsive and creepy, but it's just legal
4221040	4224080	enough to where he'll probably get away with it.
4224080	4228480	Sarah has said that she's looking at bringing civil action against Onision, which I think
4228480	4231680	has a much better chance of getting some sort of conviction.
4231680	4233320	But he won't be jailed for this.
4233320	4234920	He'll have to pay damages.
4234920	4238760	Still better than nothing, but if this happens, he won't be going to jail.
4238760	4242520	Just before I end off today, I want to present to you one more aspect surrounding criminal
4242520	4245260	trial that you might not be aware of.
4245260	4249520	In order to have a successful trial, a jury needs to be unbiased according to the Sixth
4249520	4250520	Amendment.
4250520	4254800	There have been situations where a case has been thrown out completely due to a jury not
4254800	4259740	being able to be unbiased, perhaps in the case of significant media attention.
4259740	4262840	We live in a very interesting time with online media.
4262840	4267800	In the past, restrictions have been put on newspapers and TV in certain situations to
4267800	4270480	prevent a jury from being biased.
4270480	4274680	Just recently in Australia, newspapers and TV were banned from reporting on the conviction
4274680	4278120	of Cardinal Pell, as the case was still ongoing.
4278120	4281720	This has happened in the US before, and it's not out of the question that it might happen
4281720	4284600	with Onision if he does go to trial.
4284600	4288380	But the internet is not able to be controlled so easily.
4288380	4292380	With the internet becoming the new place where people are consuming their news and entertainment,
4292380	4296160	the dangers of influencing a jury begin to increase.
4296160	4300240	This is certainly a bit of a stretch, but it's important to consider that while reporting
4300240	4305640	on Onision's actions may assist in bringing his actions to light, it may also hinder civil
4305640	4309880	processes, and that is something we all have to keep in mind going forward.
4326160	4331360	I owe it to you, but I have some unfinished business here, so I suggest we round this up.
4339840	4344040	As noted, there is no guarantee that there will be legal ramifications facing Onision.
4344040	4348300	There may be more evidence, and that may alter the likelihood of any legal cases, but certain
4348300	4352180	individuals saying that others should be calling the police rather than making these videos
4352180	4355440	on it seem to have a bizarre grasp on the situation.
4355440	4359320	A lot of what Onision's been accused of doing isn't a black and white legal question.
4359320	4363340	A lot of the points regarding grooming aren't things that he's necessarily going to be convicted
4363340	4368500	of, and that's the way the law operates, on the steepest burden of proof, rightfully so must I add.
4368500	4372520	I will also add that when dealing with criminal evidence, the first thing you should do is
4372520	4376920	go to the police, but I will clarify it, I don't think a lot of what we're dealing with
4376920	4381000	today makes him a criminal, I just think they make him an unequivocally terrible person
4381000	4382800	who has grossly abused his power.
4382840	4387560	This is not exempting the possibility that actually legally incriminating evidence has been withheld
4387560	4392600	from the public eye, which would be completely justified, but he's a man who clearly has tried to
4392600	4398520	legally cover his backside, and we have to prepare for the possibility that he remains a free man.
4398520	4403520	Being a bad person doesn't mean being a criminal, but just because you're not a criminal doesn't mean
4403520	4408400	that you should have a platform, especially if you exploit the power in a way that a lot of the evidence
4408400	4412960	suggests that Onision has. Warning people who may fall for his mental tricks, and cautioning those who
4412960	4418440	may be romantically vulnerable to his manipulation is not a legal thing, you can't take out restraining
4418440	4424280	orders on behalf of all 16 year olds, you just gotta make your voice loud and clear, and hope they hear it.
4424280	4429400	Onision will continue to pull out all the stops to make sure he's not liable, as said, the gradual
4429400	4434520	isolation of his content is a step in that direction, but he also recently wiped his Twitter completely,
4434520	4439600	and he's continued to delete certain videos off his channel, often ones that on the surface, I couldn't really
4439600	4444520	see the purpose behind, but there may be something deeper within them. A lot of them have been archived
4444520	4449320	regardless, so there's not really a great amount of good in removing them at this point, though maybe he's
4449320	4454720	hoping investigating authorities will have a bit of a boomer approach to social media. Of course, it's not just
4454720	4460200	the feeds and the videos that make him liable, it's people like Kai as well, whose allegations definitely extend
4460200	4465280	into the criminal question, and like the possibly incriminating tweets and videos, Onision appears to have
4465280	4470800	deleted Kai. In fact, a police report was filed on the 22nd of November by a concerned neighbour who said
4470800	4472720	they hadn't seen Kai in a while.
4472720	4485080	Another report posted on November the 9th concerned a confrontation in which physical contact occurred,
4485080	4487560	which has led to some more conspiracy theories.
4487800	4489480	Communications, how may I help you?
4489480	4493320	Hello, is this the Gig Harbor non-emergency line?
4493320	4495880	Yep, we dispatched for them, how can I help you?
4495880	4502840	Hey, I wasn't sure if this was an emergency or not, but I would like to report something that might be an issue,
4502840	4507600	it looks like some sort of argument going down at a house.
4507600	4509360	Is this going on inside or outside?
4509360	4518880	I saw some people coming in and out of the house, looks like some sort of maybe 30s white male and a short-haired
4518880	4525720	sort of androgynous looking female, I'm not sure, and I'm not sure how it looks like a pretty heated argument
4525720	4528920	or whatever was going on, but I wasn't sure that it was emergency level.
4528920	4534640	Now, I doubt anything's actually happened, Kai, it's just very likely that Greg's hiding him from the public spotlight,
4534640	4539000	because the best way to deal with legal investigations is to give them as little as possible,
4539000	4544280	and that includes people as well, other than the involvement in the legal complaint against Repzion and Chris Hansen,
4544280	4546360	there hasn't been much activity from Kai.
4546360	4552120	Towards the end of December, there was a post on his Patreon, assumedly from him, stating that he would be taking a hiatus.
4552120	4556840	Onision is paranoid, and that shows, in a report that was recently made publicly available,
4556840	4561400	there was an accident involving his daughter, where she fell from the window of our house and cracked her skull open.
4561400	4566760	Alright, so these things happen, and honestly, it is really sad, but what was telling were the additional details,
4566760	4572760	including the information that while waiting for the paramedics to arrive, Greg decided to film the aftermath of the accident.
4572760	4578600	Now, if that raises your eyebrows, then understandable, as it raised the eyebrows of the police officers investigating as well.
4578600	4581320	What was his justification for this? Well, two reasons.
4581320	4586600	The first one, which I personally don't find very convincing, is that he wanted to record the landscape to provide information
4586600	4590920	for medical professionals so that they knew about the fall, but I doubt that.
4590920	4594960	What I personally find more plausible is the second explanation, where Greg states,
4594960	4602080	concern that he's afraid people might implicate him, referring to a situation when someone allegedly framed him for their suicide attempt.
4602080	4608440	Honestly, in spite of the lack of sense this argument makes, I find it more likely that he probably viewed it from that perspective
4608440	4615080	at the time he was worried that someone would blame him, given the nature of the internet currently, everyone does indeed hate him.
4615080	4619800	I must clarify that just by filming the aftermath does not mean that you couldn't have committed a crime,
4619800	4623800	although I personally don't believe he did, it seems slightly irresponsible that if the parents acknowledge
4623840	4631840	the child is prone to climbing a lot of things, they'd allow that setup to take place, though I digress, I do not know enough about that specific situation.
4631840	4638640	I must also observe how inappropriate it was that at the time he was due in the hospital, he was tweeting out various sexual content,
4638640	4645680	but maybe that was a paranoid reaction too, we all know that he's been recently trying to make his accounts so explicitly 18+,
4645680	4651800	maybe so he couldn't be accused of roping fans in with child oriented content before ambushing them with the adult stuff.
4651840	4658360	Perhaps with all these legal changes right now, he was worried about that too, though I personally think it's all a bit too late for that.
4658360	4667160	I'd also like to say that this is a very ill thought out tweet a few days after this incident, I'm not sure that's the sort of imagery you should be invoking, Gregory.
4667160	4675560	So with this paranoia, and with his bizarre reactions that it seems to provoke, he has had one more outlook that I think I'd debunk before reaching my conclusion,
4675600	4684040	and that is the hashtag satire. With his recent pinned comment, and the tags, it seems he might try and dismiss certain actions as a joke in the future,
4684040	4689200	and although there are certain things that you could explain in a farcical light, such as maybe his twitter comments,
4689200	4697720	a lot of evidence the stuff he has done to other people can't be explained as easily, because he presented a serious environment for many of the people
4697720	4703160	who are accusing him today, and the trauma that they felt is very real, that is beyond comedy.
4703240	4710360	I feel that he may be trying to shield himself from liability, and perhaps in the instance of legal prosecution, attempt to mitigate the sentence,
4710360	4717480	because obviously the sentence can depend on a lot of conditions, and there's a lot of minor things here that obviously wouldn't be incriminating on their own,
4717480	4721160	but when paired with a criminal conviction could harm a person's case.
4721160	4726920	Recently there has been this wave of narratives, I think partly accountable to the justified exhaustion of people talking about Onision,
4726920	4733080	and the overstepping of boundaries by certain individuals. They seem to be adapting greats, where's the proof line of reasoning?
4733080	4739000	The first logical fallacy in this argument is that I still don't know what claims they're responding to generally when they say that.
4739000	4749320	Where is the proof? There's shit that obviously makes Onision look bad, treating people horrible, but where is the...
4749320	4756360	I mean, a picture or something of Onision making out with one of these girls when they're underage, like where is the proof?
4756360	4758600	I mean, it's more...
4758600	4766840	Keemstar obviously clarifies here, for example, that it's underage making out, but for me that was such a small proportion of the allegations with so much more to consider.
4766840	4771320	If you want proof that Greg's manipulative to the point of false suicide threats, then there's proof.
4771320	4776040	If you want proof that Greg has used his platform to publicly shame and abuse people, then there's proof.
4776040	4781080	If you want proof that Greg hid a minor from the public eye and their own parents to then marry them, then there's proof.
4781080	4787000	If you want proof that after continuously reaching out to a person who is clearly not interested in them, Greg publicly stated on a video,
4787000	4791640	still up on his channel, that he intended to wait until they were 18 to get with them, then there's proof.
4791640	4798920	That Greg is abusing the Content ID system to copyright claim critical videos off him, something that I thought everyone cared about, then there's proof.
4798920	4807320	If you want proof that Greg uploaded over 60 videos on a mentally vulnerable anorexic person, as well as making claims they were accountable for the deaths of others, then there's proof.
4807320	4816920	If you want proof that Greg roped in significantly younger people for weird three-way dynamics, uploading it onto his channel, or using its influence to coerce and pressure certain outcomes, then there's proof.
4816920	4822280	If you want proof that Greg publicly posted people's contact details, then heaven help me, there is proof.
4822280	4829320	If you want proof that Onision lied while filing court order, there is proof. I could go on, and that's not even getting to Kai.
4829320	4836280	You can interpret and even challenge the proof if you personally question its validity, but denying the existence of proof is just lazy.
4836280	4840840	There's not some big twist here. As said, there's obviously certain claims that are harder to prove.
4840840	4848680	When I went over the specific underage making out allegation, I stated that it could not be proven. You can 100% make your own judgement on that.
4848680	4859400	I'm not sure that claims like pedophilia are true, and it's okay to have reservations about the case, but a lot of what we've discussed is hard to challenge, especially when a lot of it was on Onision's own channel.
4859400	4865720	And that is the second logical fallacy, to believe that the existence of an angry mob somehow implies that a person is innocent.
4865720	4873400	Mobs that lose sense of reasoning and justice are not good, for sure, and we've discussed that before, and people can see the problems with it.
4873400	4880360	But let's be real here, many commentators will be foaming at the mouth for Onision's copyright abuse alone if he was any other creator.
4880360	4887000	Criticise who you need to, but criticism of one side does not exonerate the other. Don't make that mistake.
4887000	4894440	As said, I think it's tentative whether Onision will actually see legal consequences for his actions, but he's not some calculated mastermind.
4894440	4902200	He clearly doesn't know his fate either, and he's doing everything to make sure, because he knows that nothing will stop him harder than the long arm of the law.
4902200	4907080	But as we know, it might not stop him. So how can we, and what is there left to say?
4911080	4916600	Onision, acting like I'm better than a lot of people when many of those people are more caring, sociable, and selfless than I am, or may ever be.
4916600	4925400	As said, I've only been able to cover so much regarding this interesting specimen, and there's still a lot deeper you could go.
4925400	4933080	But ultimately, what I want to do today was at least create a comprehensive case for why Onision's future on the platform of YouTube should be questioned.
4933080	4943160	Whether Onision plays within the bounds of legality, and even the YouTube rules, which I would question, there's a result that his behaviour yields which shows the consequences of his actions.
4943160	4955000	That should not be ignored. Obviously, the ultimate goal for many people will be to have his YouTube channels removed, and I understand that given how he has leveraged that clout to cause so much of this drama and suffering.
4955000	4961960	However, you also want to keep in mind the fact that regardless of what happens, even if you remove his YouTube, he will continue to persist.
4961960	4968360	All this drama has shown is that attempting to push him down brings him back more aggressively, in some form or another.
4968360	4973720	He'll move to a different platform, he'll change the structures in place to support him, he wants to adapt.
4973720	4980280	Plenty of people know how to loophole the rules, it's extremely important to be conscious of that, and the consequences that it may yield.
4980280	4988120	People just like DaddyOFive. Now, DaddyOFive was an abusive man-child with a victim complex, and he should have definitely had his child terminated.
4988120	4996280	However, I don't think he ever mobilised his platform to the degree that Onision does, and that means that even if Onision loses his YouTube channel,
4996280	5002200	there's no guarantee that he loses all the modes of communication with the audience that many people are concerned about.
5002200	5007640	Even now, he's clearly demonstrating modes to change in a way that protects his source of income.
5007640	5015800	That's the problem in many ways, putting someone out of sight doesn't mean they lose their power, sometimes it just isolates them with their victims even more,
5015800	5021960	so if you really consider Onision a threat, it never stops at him being held to account on one platform.
5021960	5029800	You have to be actively conscious about all platforms, I think that's the problem for many people, how does one stay focused on Onision's ventures?
5029800	5038280	After this video, there is a strong chance that I won't make another, and in many ways, you could say by doing that, I'm not exactly following up and keeping tabs on him.
5038280	5046760	I hope there will be people who do keep tabs on him, but at the same time, I wouldn't necessarily expect people to, and eventually, every topic dies out.
5046760	5056520	But Onision doesn't stop being Onision, Onision never stops being Onision, the only thing that may stop him is a criminal conviction, and that is not guaranteed to happen.
5056520	5063960	Obviously, I keep the option open, but I think you have to prepare for the worst case scenario, you have to be ready for Onision to wriggle his way out of this,
5063960	5067960	because that's what he is known to do, and that's what he will do time and time again.
5067960	5076120	I don't like Onision, I don't think he's a good person, I don't think he's an honest person, I feel that he's caused a lot of pain and dealt a lot of abuse to people who loved him,
5076120	5083160	particularly that of the psychological nature. Many of those people looked to him, and in the end, they went to him, with some going through Kai.
5083160	5090200	Onision was a creator with a lot of power, and that allowed him to retain a fan base in spite of the numerous controversies.
5090200	5097000	This time round, he was not so fortunate, and many of his worst behaviours were placed on display for the world to judge,
5097000	5103800	behaviours that now seeing them in the context of his YouTube channel shows his calculated and manipulative nature.
5103880	5109400	A significant proportion of the evidence is hard to see in any other context that may change people's minds,
5109400	5114120	and understandably, this has led many to call on YouTube to take full retributive actions.
5114120	5118440	I don't think Onision should be allowed to upload the content that he is currently on his channel,
5118440	5126520	and even if you think that he should have a channel, it's hard to see how these new videos are going to help him or anyone else in any capacity,
5126520	5131640	other than a monetary one. Of course, we have a strong suspicion that this is all an elaborate ploy,
5131640	5137000	which would explain a fair bit, to be honest. Although there have been minor victories that clearly irritate him,
5137000	5143880	such as the removal of his Patreon, overall, I still think he has other plans, and I don't think he'll be giving them up easily.
5143880	5147480	What about the future of his channel? Well, providing the channel does have a future,
5147480	5156520	he'll probably round out this rather bizarre series of content with a more serious video that will try and exemplify the meltdown videos as a result of personal persecution,
5156520	5161320	or maybe he'll go in a more insane direction until people stop providing the views they draw right now.
5161880	5172520	I don't like the question, how do I become a vegetarian, because it's like, it's kind of like, how do I, how do I lose weight, or how do I stop smoking,
5172520	5180600	how do I stop drinking, how do I stop beating my wife, or driving under the influence of drugs or something.
5180600	5188520	You know, it's just, it's really, really simple. Self-control. Why can't you? Why can't you just stop eating meat?
5188520	5193960	I'm telling you that you are an intelligent human being, and that you are capable of just stopping.
5193960	5201400	One of the philosophical dichotomies that Onision has preached in many of his videos is the idea of survival versus greed.
5201400	5208760	He believes the latter, greed, is undesirable, but Onision himself is merely greed masquerading as survival.
5208760	5217160	He takes what he can get, but he can get a lot more than most, and if you don't stop him, he'll blame you, and if you do stop him, he'll blame you.
5217240	5225160	There is no easy way around the Onision conundrum, at the end of the day, we can best create a discourse on this behaviour and bring attention to it,
5225160	5233160	not just for the sake of the people who may be a target, but for ourselves. Do what you think is right, have pure motivations.
5233160	5239720	Onision is a man of many motivations, but none of which are remotely beneficial for the general YouTube aura.
5239720	5246600	Some of his motivations are sexual, some of them are monetary, but they all intertwine into the idea of power that he wishes to retain,
5246600	5254920	and until one deprives him of that power, he has a complacency and determination that means I do worry about anyone else who may fall under his grasp,
5254920	5262120	which, as shown throughout this series, is still possible. I don't think the results of that power are positive for those around him,
5262120	5267800	either they end up being scarred, or they end up like Kai, whose behaviour has been equally wretched.
5267800	5275560	There's no way to succinctly sum up everything I've spoken about in the last few videos, but I hope you keep it all in mind when arbitrating your opinion,
5275560	5282360	and hopefully come to an educated conclusion. May you watch some other videos too, I might. I won't hold it against you.
5282360	5288360	For now though, the best I can personally hope is that no one suffers on Onision's hands again in that way,
5288360	5292360	and we can all take a few lessons forward from this situation.
5292360	5298120	Life. It's a thing that happens to pretty much everyone in some capacity.
5298120	5303400	From the day that life begins to the day it ends, it encompasses an experience unique to that individual.
5303400	5310680	How that individual may interpret their own life is also something unique, but one really must wonder how Onision views his life,
5310680	5316360	when he treats his reputation a sparing second to the power that he's always wished to acquire.
5316360	5320040	In a video where he talks about his ascent to suicide, he says this.
5321000	5331560	On that day I made a decision.
5332520	5340520	I was either going to kill myself there, or I was going to give myself some good reasons to live on.
5340520	5344520	In my mind I pulled that trigger.
5344520	5350520	In my mind, the moment that gun was to my head, I stopped being afraid.
5350520	5356520	I stopped caring.
5356520	5362520	I've changed as a person since that day.
5362520	5372520	Because now I feel like no matter what happens to me, I made it way further than I should have.
5372520	5376520	I am just brain splattered on a wall.
5376520	5384520	What you are looking at is a talking suicide.
5384520	5391000	So when you guys call me brave, remember you're just talking to a ghost.
5391800	5397240	It might just be another disposable video where he tends to rope in people with false death,
5397240	5401720	but whether the story behind it is true, the philosophy leads me to a question.
5401720	5406840	When someone lacks the grasp of one's own life or one's own purpose,
5406840	5410760	where do they draw the boundaries of how they treat other people's lives?
5410760	5414440	Onision has never played the boundaries like anyone else,
5414440	5419320	never with the regard for those around him that he gives and expects himself.
5419320	5423800	There is little debate over a lot of what he's done, and how he's regularly failed to justify
5423800	5429240	those actions, but the one question I do ponder is how aware of this behaviour he is,
5429240	5433160	whether he does perceive himself as the victim of some delirious witch hunt,
5433160	5436840	or if he knows of his deeply flawed attitude and approach.
5436840	5441480	I'm not entirely sure, but his moments of clarity do seem to be telling sometimes.
5442120	5447560	Throughout this video, I've shown clips from a 2014 upload called Who I Really Am
5447560	5452680	on his Onision channel, a video whose candid accuracy I felt couldn't be ignored,
5452680	5457000	and I'll leave you and Onision with one more quote from that.
5457000	5459400	Onision- I could try to pretend things are different, but that would mean lying.
5461480	5464600	If the truth is your enemy, then your real enemy is yourself.
5464600	5465640	Thank you.
5494600	5497480	I want to give a big shout out to my Patreons.
5497480	5501000	My $10 Patreons are all up on screen right now.
5501000	5503640	They do fantastic work, thank you.
5503640	5510040	I need to give a big shout out to my $50 Patreons, Somehullabaloo, Nico Deschamps, and Caroline,
5510040	5514440	and a very special thanks to my $100 Patreons, Brandon and Stanton.
5514440	5516120	Thank you guys so much, really.
5517000	5517560	Thank you.
5517560	5521800	If you want to reach me, my Twitter is at TheRightOpinion, Facebook TheRightOpinion,

5527240	5531880	I don't really have too much else to add, I think I might go and fall into an eternal sleep.
5531880	5537000	So until then, I'm TheRightOpinion, and I will see you in the next one.
