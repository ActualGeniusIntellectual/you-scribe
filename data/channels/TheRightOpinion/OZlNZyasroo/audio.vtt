00:00.000 --> 00:14.280
I've made a lot of mistakes. There are many things I wish I could take back. But I cannot

00:14.280 --> 00:24.280
grow if I refuse to see myself for who I truly am.

00:24.280 --> 00:27.560
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:27.560 --> 00:31.480
too much free time, and my free time has been delightfully occupied by what will be

00:31.480 --> 00:37.080
the person at the centre of today's final video. It is not necessarily something I've

00:37.080 --> 00:41.600
found myself enjoying too much, but one must finish what he hath started, and I have to

00:41.600 --> 00:46.520
admit, in spite of everything, all the other videos, and all the information, I definitely

00:46.520 --> 00:50.960
underestimated the undertaking this topic would require, and even then I will be undoubtedly

00:50.960 --> 00:55.280
disappointed that I have not been able to cover every single corner, look at every one

00:55.280 --> 01:00.720
of his crap films, look at his books, see what's between the lines, maybe one day I

01:00.720 --> 01:07.480
will return, but that day is not today. Even with every private video, every deleted tweet,

01:07.480 --> 01:12.680
every single redacted statement, Onision has given me more than enough to work with, more

01:12.680 --> 01:17.800
than I'd like, to be honest, and today we shall be closing that off in style. Although

01:17.800 --> 01:22.600
not a requirement, I would recommend watching the previous videos to have a contextual grip

01:22.600 --> 01:25.560
of what we lead into today.

01:25.560 --> 01:30.560
A lot of what we've observed is, on the surface, the product of putting your life online. Onision

01:30.560 --> 01:35.120
has, in a way, created his own story through the medium of YouTube, and I've often wondered

01:35.120 --> 01:40.120
if Greg himself sees his life like a movie, one where he plays the main character, one

01:40.120 --> 01:44.680
where he can be this role model to other people, this tortured individual, always on the line

01:44.680 --> 01:49.120
between good and evil. I mean, we saw that in his little cult project, he had this dark

01:49.120 --> 01:54.020
and light theme, and this sort of line between them, but the thing is, you can't easily manufacture

01:54.020 --> 01:59.240
such a character unless you're a real artist, and the problem was that Greg clearly integrated

01:59.240 --> 02:03.620
a lot of his own personal investments into this character, a lot of strange desires that

02:03.620 --> 02:08.480
didn't merely involve him, and ultimately led to many people being hurt. Movies are

02:08.480 --> 02:12.760
often movies for a reason, we may idolise some characters, we may even see parts of

02:12.760 --> 02:17.840
ourselves in the worst people, but self control is a necessary constituent that should be

02:17.840 --> 02:22.460
exercised, especially when you're a public figure with great responsibility.

02:22.460 --> 02:26.720
The way that Onision had cultivated his audience gave him an even greater responsibility than

02:26.720 --> 02:31.320
many creators, because his audience were highly committed to him as a personality, and would

02:31.320 --> 02:36.160
likely be heavily influenced by his behaviour. He had carved out this corner on the internet

02:36.160 --> 02:41.360
that was relatively isolated from reality. Onision was never interested in responsibility

02:41.360 --> 02:45.520
though, and over time, he had managed to isolate various people who bought into his doctrine

02:45.520 --> 02:50.280
more closely, and did for a significant amount of time, whether by luck or by judgement,

02:50.280 --> 02:55.240
get away with it. As mentioned at the end of last video, by September 2019, the tides

02:55.240 --> 02:59.280
were beginning to turn, instigated by many people, but brought forward by a person named

02:59.280 --> 03:04.640
Sarah primarily, arguably the most concerning example of the people he involved in his life.

03:04.640 --> 03:08.540
A lot of people at this point had already been dunking on Onision, he was a popular

03:08.540 --> 03:13.120
target that accumulated views, but this was what finally pushed many people over the top

03:13.120 --> 03:19.000
with their criticisms, and it went from look at this dude to look at this dude. These criticisms

03:19.000 --> 03:23.300
have mostly amounted to focusing on his predatory behaviour, although there are many actions

03:23.300 --> 03:27.680
that shouldn't be ignored either. Regardless of what he says, Onision pays close attention

03:27.680 --> 03:31.320
to the drum that revolves around him, pays close attention to the videos being made on

03:31.320 --> 03:35.560
him and knows what's being said about him, and this often leads to questions being asked

03:35.560 --> 03:39.520
of him by his fans, and he has often responded to them. As noted, some of these responses

03:39.520 --> 03:43.160
are for the better, sometimes these responses are for the worse. One of the things that

03:43.160 --> 03:46.800
you will hear on a fairly repetitive basis is how honest he is.

03:46.800 --> 03:52.400
There's a reason people call me the most brutally honest YouTuber, it's because I f***ing am,

03:52.400 --> 03:56.960
I'm the most brutally honest popular YouTuber, hundreds of thousands if not millions of people

03:56.960 --> 04:00.520
know me to be the most brutally honest YouTuber.

04:00.520 --> 04:05.240
Now if that isn't a guy you can trust, I don't know who is. He'll have this assured tone

04:05.240 --> 04:09.380
in the way he speaks, and he'll often speak about setting the record straight, he'll express

04:09.380 --> 04:13.300
a confidence that will likely soften those who are willing to give him the benefit of

04:13.300 --> 04:18.340
the doubt. He also often uses words and phrases that portray his honesty in an exceptional

04:18.340 --> 04:23.420
light. Yeah guys, I'm an honest YouTuber, must be a surprise round here. Those sorts

04:23.420 --> 04:26.760
of narratives are not just designed to show himself in a positive light, but show his

04:26.760 --> 04:31.300
critics in a negative one. After all, if he's really the person telling the truth and laying

04:31.300 --> 04:35.700
down the law, how are you meant to believe anyone else? These are all classic tactics

04:35.700 --> 04:39.660
that have led him to be relatively protected by his most devoted audience. Another tactic

04:39.660 --> 04:43.260
that he has developed over the years was creating conclaves of the internet where he could have

04:43.260 --> 04:47.620
control over what's being said about him. For example, you look up videos on Onision

04:47.620 --> 04:51.460
on YouTube in the last few years, and they wouldn't be the most positive. However, go

04:51.460 --> 04:55.900
over to his numerous websites whose domain changes every few months, and you may find

04:55.900 --> 04:59.980
a consensus more devoted to defending him. In a way, his Patreon was probably one of

04:59.980 --> 05:04.160
the best examples of this. Patreon is a nice way for many creators to make buck when Susan

05:04.160 --> 05:09.240
isn't feeling as generous. However, by creating a paywall, Onision creates a dilemma for his

05:09.240 --> 05:12.620
critics. They can pay to see what's going on behind the scenes, see what Onision is

05:12.620 --> 05:16.880
chatting and thus criticise it, and bring that content to the public eye, but then again,

05:16.880 --> 05:20.840
if it's nothing particularly substantial other than Onision being Onision, you're paying

05:20.840 --> 05:24.960
money into his Patreon, you're financially supporting him, so you might want to leave

05:24.960 --> 05:27.840
it, but then you don't know what he's up to, and it might be worse than one thinks, and

05:27.840 --> 05:31.920
he might need to be stopped. That's ultimately the concern of many of these platforms, and

05:31.920 --> 05:36.600
exactly how, for a long time, he has to control a proportion of his fanbase. We'll discuss

05:36.600 --> 05:40.500
the fate of his Patreon very soon, but this has always allowed him to capitalise on the

05:40.500 --> 05:44.720
drama in rather derivative ways. For example, when testimony started coming out regarding

05:44.720 --> 05:49.000
him around September time, he'd release these videos with very vague, ambiguous titles,

05:49.000 --> 05:53.560
and most of it was rubbish, rambling, monetised rambling I must add, which were purposely

05:53.560 --> 05:57.920
vague to remain monetised. Even with all this criticism, all this stigma, nothing mattered

05:57.920 --> 06:02.480
as long as he had fans, and he was making money, those two factors will always keep

06:02.480 --> 06:07.300
him buoyant. So how was this deconstructed, and is there still more to do? Join me today

06:07.300 --> 06:12.400
in this final instalment, The Fall of Onision, where we document what went wrong, what went

06:12.400 --> 06:17.560
right, and at what point I can go back to sleeping at night. Let's dive right in.

06:27.920 --> 06:32.800
The first step to holding someone to a decent

06:32.800 --> 06:36.720
account is publicity. Now honestly, after the year that's been, the sheer inertia that

06:36.720 --> 06:40.720
many people are understandably experiencing, that's a harder job than most. I don't think

06:40.720 --> 06:45.120
people really wanted to have to deal with another case. Nonetheless, Onision had the

06:45.120 --> 06:49.680
attention of his previous actions which followed through onto today's situation. As noted in

06:49.680 --> 06:54.080
my first video, I think Onision's behaviour was visibly irrational, in a way to make sure

06:54.080 --> 06:59.040
that his audience was isolated in their commitment to him. In the past, his rather awful behaviour

06:59.040 --> 07:03.960
seemed purposefully attention seeking, particularly when he was making commentary on other creators.

07:03.960 --> 07:07.680
He knew what he was doing, and he wanted their attention, and for many people, you don't

07:07.680 --> 07:12.400
want to necessarily feed that. It was a running fact that videos on Onision would get more

07:12.400 --> 07:17.260
than actual Onision videos, and that in a way, it might be better to not make videos

07:17.260 --> 07:21.360
on him at all, because you're so obviously punching down and just giving him the attention

07:21.360 --> 07:25.620
that he desires. Although I agree with this to an extent, I'd also defend people who

07:25.620 --> 07:29.480
criticised him because of the fact that he did already have an established fan base,

07:29.480 --> 07:33.880
and I'm not sure if more people would be indoctrinated by him than people who disconnected

07:33.880 --> 07:38.280
from him due to this run in criticism. I noted that many of these fans were probably captured

07:38.280 --> 07:42.600
in his narrative at quite a young age, and as they mature and become a bit more conscious

07:42.600 --> 07:46.520
of the flaws in his narratives, it might help seeing the additional videos calling him out

07:46.520 --> 07:51.280
on those. There are three general basic ways when you interact with someone's content.

07:51.280 --> 07:55.680
Negative attention, negative attention, and no attention. The goal in the past was to

07:55.680 --> 08:00.200
make sure he didn't really receive any additional attention outside of what was necessary, to

08:00.200 --> 08:04.320
hold him to account for his bogus content. In the last few months, the perspective has

08:04.320 --> 08:09.000
split, and the goal has now been to shine negative attention on his actions. Overall,

08:09.000 --> 08:12.480
the momentum has been gathering. Multiple new creators have been covering the topic

08:12.480 --> 08:16.720
with fresh perspectives and commentary which engages new audiences. There were many accounts

08:16.720 --> 08:21.920
set up to completely document his actions, providing accessibility to content creators

08:21.920 --> 08:25.960
to pick up the story quickly, thus spreading the word further, and they deserve their kudos

08:25.960 --> 08:30.240
too. Nonetheless, attention on this scale only really matters if you can bring about

08:30.240 --> 08:34.360
real systemic change, and there are always gonna be some people attached to Onision no

08:34.360 --> 08:38.480
matter what. Commentators are helpful, but their scope is limited, and it could very

08:38.480 --> 08:43.720
easily fizzle out. However, it hasn't stopped there, in fact, there was one more twist to

08:44.680 --> 08:49.000
The final character I want to introduce to this is someone by the name of Chris Hansen.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.200
Chris Hansen was famous for his MSNBC show To Catch a Predator, which aired between 2004

08:54.200 --> 08:59.640
and 2007. Now, this show wasn't overly successful then, and actually had its fair share of controversies,

08:59.640 --> 09:03.840
but it has enjoyed a cultural resurgence in recent years due to the many, many memes,

09:03.840 --> 09:08.220
but also the relevance to a platform like YouTube with many predators on there too.

09:08.220 --> 09:11.480
Now identifying this relevance over the last few months, Chris Hansen has been setting

09:11.480 --> 09:15.720
up shop on the platform, and hosting his own streams where he discusses cases of online

09:15.720 --> 09:18.080
predation with various victims and creators.

09:18.080 --> 09:22.200
Chris Hansen Good evening everyone from New York City, I'm Chris Hansen, and this is

09:22.200 --> 09:26.840
Have a Seat with Chris Hansen, live on my YouTube channel, Have a Seat with Chris Hansen.

09:26.840 --> 09:32.620
So thanks for tuning in, we have a very special guest tonight, as you know we've been kind

09:32.620 --> 09:38.320
of exploring this whole world of predator behaviour, whoops I said predator, I'll get

09:38.320 --> 09:45.520
back to that in a minute, on YouTube specifically having to do with a YouTube sensation named

09:45.520 --> 09:48.920
Onision, whose real name is Greg Jackson, we've talked about it.

09:48.920 --> 09:52.920
Now the medium that Chris Hansen was operating on now was one where you could reach him much

09:52.920 --> 09:57.680
more directly, and eventually with the momentum, he would have been a fool to ignore the case.

09:57.680 --> 10:01.640
To many people, Chris Hansen was a blessing of his own, him covering the case would provide

10:01.640 --> 10:05.560
a lot more mainstream interest due to his leanings, and the fact that he transcends

10:05.560 --> 10:09.840
the stigma that many creators have of just being a YouTuber, he can exert influence in

10:09.840 --> 10:14.560
areas that others may not be able to, even if he doesn't have a huge number of subscribers,

10:14.560 --> 10:19.160
he's a media figure, he holds clout on his own terms, and this sort of clout was well

10:19.160 --> 10:21.660
served in the streams that he conducted.

10:21.660 --> 10:25.280
It's hard to pick on specific details, but if you watch them, it gives people a platform

10:25.280 --> 10:29.640
to talk about their own experiences, and allows investigations to be conducted in a relatively

10:29.640 --> 10:31.760
safe and professional environment.

10:31.760 --> 10:36.120
It's important that they're somewhat careful, as publicising certain information can compromise

10:36.120 --> 10:40.480
future legal processes, however, on the other hand, the attention that Chris Hansen has

10:40.480 --> 10:45.560
provided may be able to kickstart investigations that have more scope and power to work out

10:45.560 --> 10:47.480
what's going on behind the scenes.

10:47.480 --> 10:55.900
I did have a conversation with the FBI yesterday, with the breaking news here, and obviously

10:55.900 --> 11:02.400
there was evidence that some of the young women have that could very well be of interest

11:02.400 --> 11:04.420
to investigators.

11:04.420 --> 11:13.500
And contact is being made within the Bureau, between the different field offices involved

11:13.500 --> 11:20.260
here across the country, including Washington State, where a lot of this activity took place.

11:20.260 --> 11:28.500
But again, a reminder that even though Greg Jackson, Onision, Kai, apparently were very

11:28.500 --> 11:33.660
careful about ages in terms of having young women visit, sexual relations, and everything

11:33.660 --> 11:40.460
else, what many people in these cases don't know, don't think about, aren't aware of,

11:40.460 --> 11:48.660
is that the transmission of sexually explicit pictures of people younger than 18 is a federal

11:48.660 --> 11:49.660
crime.

11:49.660 --> 11:54.460
It can either be enticement, it can be the transmission of child pornography, it is a

11:54.460 --> 11:58.020
penalty which carries a sentence of 10 years per image.

11:58.020 --> 12:01.660
If it's a video, it's 10 years per frame.

12:01.660 --> 12:11.020
So there is a very good chance that there's going to be a criminal investigation here,

12:11.020 --> 12:14.980
and we will keep everybody posted on this.

12:14.980 --> 12:18.540
This is not all sunshine and rainbows though, as Hansen and his team, most notably Vincent

12:18.540 --> 12:21.660
Nakotra, has come under severe criticism for their practice on YouTube.

12:21.660 --> 12:25.780
We're all aware that this generation may be a bit more out of touch, and Chris Hansen's

12:25.780 --> 12:29.980
boomer eye contact doesn't lie, but as observed by many, it appears that Vincent's abusive

12:29.980 --> 12:34.980
power of copyright striking, doxxing, and scamming goes beyond naivety, and for a significant

12:34.980 --> 12:39.780
amount of time, Chris Hansen's decision to keep him on in spite of this seemed ill-advised.

12:39.780 --> 12:43.460
There are other videos that document this more comprehensively, such as Mr. Gee-Gees,

12:43.460 --> 12:45.260
which I would definitely recommend watching.

12:45.260 --> 12:49.420
Now let me make it clear, Chris Hansen's videos have an invaluable place in this case,

12:49.420 --> 12:54.340
however the greater good cannot excuse abuse of power, and such behavior could easily compromise

12:54.340 --> 12:57.460
what you've been working for, and it may well have already.

12:57.460 --> 13:01.940
You guys should not be giving Vince a pass because you don't want to derail the Onision

13:01.940 --> 13:06.600
investigation, because people not addressing this, and continuing to allow Vince to be

13:06.600 --> 13:12.140
a loose cannon, will be the ultimate derail to this investigation, but that's just my

13:12.140 --> 13:13.140
opinion.

13:13.220 --> 13:17.140
At the start of January 2020, Chris Hansen stated that he would be reviewing Vincent's

13:17.140 --> 13:21.240
conduct, and a few weeks later he announced Vincent's departure from the show, most likely

13:21.240 --> 13:25.560
due to the information that Vincent had mishandled Sarah's laptop with possible implications

13:25.560 --> 13:28.140
to the subsequent legal admissibility of it.

13:28.140 --> 13:31.340
Although there was some suspicion whether Vincent has actually been sacked, lack of

13:31.340 --> 13:35.220
new information prevailing, benefit of the doubt will be provided on that front, however

13:35.220 --> 13:40.120
the damage may have already been done, though I sure hope not, I may well be saving the

13:40.120 --> 13:42.180
rest of this for a video of my own.

13:42.220 --> 13:46.940
And with that serious caveat in mind, I want to turn the attention back to Onision.

13:46.940 --> 13:50.900
The mounting of the narrative against Onision, particularly in the past few months, has given

13:50.900 --> 13:55.100
him even less control on YouTube than before, however this hasn't stopped him from attempting

13:55.100 --> 13:58.460
to prevent the narrative from spreading, he's still uploading regularly, and we'll go

13:58.460 --> 14:02.460
into the details of those videos soon, but although the like-dislike ratio is enabled,

14:02.460 --> 14:03.700
the comments are not.

14:03.700 --> 14:07.700
I can't tell you Onision's exact reasoning for this, though he did make a video on it,

14:07.700 --> 14:11.840
but not sure I'm gonna buy his explanation, however if I was to guess, I'd say it's

14:11.840 --> 14:16.000
because if you show a strong dislike to like ratio against you, you can rustle up a narrative

14:16.000 --> 14:19.800
that you're the victim of mob mentality to the people who may be sympathetic towards

14:19.800 --> 14:23.340
you, while disabling the comments will prevent people from being able to rationally justify

14:23.340 --> 14:27.440
their criticism or dislike of you, there were many people who said in the past that Onision

14:27.440 --> 14:30.680
deleted comments that were critical of him, chances are that the volume of the comments

14:30.680 --> 14:34.720
became too much control or filter, and the positive comments were so rare anyway, it

14:34.720 --> 14:36.080
just wasn't worth filtering.

14:36.080 --> 14:40.440
Actually, little update here, now that hate is gearing down, he's turned the ratings

14:40.440 --> 14:44.580
off and restored comments while filtering them, which allows him to present the perspective

14:44.580 --> 14:48.280
that he is on the comeback, gaining support and healing people with the facts, we'll

14:48.280 --> 14:53.060
indulge in that in a bit, but he can be very sneaky sometimes, old Onision.

14:53.060 --> 14:56.800
Now of course, there were other creators who spoke out about his content, and their comment

14:56.800 --> 15:01.040
sections were completely open for people to express their feelings, but often an Onision

15:01.040 --> 15:05.820
devotee wouldn't watch those videos, or go into those videos with an open mind at least,

15:05.820 --> 15:09.520
and even then Onision would regularly claim and strike down videos that were critical

15:09.520 --> 15:13.480
of him, partly because of the narrative, and partly because of the money, nonetheless,

15:13.480 --> 15:17.360
he couldn't take them all out, or even Team YouTube, in all their oblivion, would probably

15:17.360 --> 15:20.440
pick up the fact that he's up to no good.

15:20.440 --> 15:24.400
Onision was clearly overwhelmed in this regard, there was nothing that he could do to halt

15:24.400 --> 15:29.300
the stream of content documenting his misgivings, but this was only part of the battle, people

15:29.300 --> 15:33.400
who had never really liked him on YouTube anyway, that dislike had just manifested into

15:33.400 --> 15:38.560
a much more active hatred, so Onision was still relatively unharmed, but that was about

15:38.560 --> 15:39.560
to change.

15:39.560 --> 15:47.480
I've destroyed most every relationship I've had with other YouTubers by being rude towards

15:47.480 --> 15:48.480
them.

15:48.480 --> 15:52.400
I am a self-made pariah.

15:52.400 --> 15:56.760
As said, at the start of this drama, Onision was uploading these very smug videos, but

15:56.760 --> 16:01.840
he knew it was coming, but he was at least trying to prepare for it, I noted in my previous

16:01.840 --> 16:06.400
video that he had started indirectly attacking Sarah by stating that people with BPD had

16:06.400 --> 16:07.520
a troubled memory.

16:07.520 --> 16:13.040
But in March, he uploaded this fantastic video, warning people about the power of fake screenshots.

16:13.040 --> 16:17.080
It's about the most important thing that is ruining people's lives right now.

16:17.080 --> 16:18.080
Fake texts.

16:18.080 --> 16:22.600
Fake screenshot texts make up 99% of all texts.

16:22.600 --> 16:25.840
That's a fake fact, and that goes to show you how fake it can get.

16:25.840 --> 16:29.840
So anyway, Snufflepuff has been accused of r***ing murder at my f***ing station.

16:29.840 --> 16:30.840
Um, what?

16:30.840 --> 16:36.380
Oh, I panda-god with no beard for some reason, maybe I was too lazy to find it, have screenshots

16:36.380 --> 16:37.380
on panda-god's phone.

16:37.380 --> 16:40.380
Oh, I guess it's true then, no one can fake screenshots.

16:40.380 --> 16:41.380
Yes!

16:41.380 --> 16:46.380
Time to ruin Snufflepuff's whole life based on these entirely authentic screenshots.

16:46.380 --> 16:51.300
Alright, so now you guys know, what you see online, the screen caps of like, you know,

16:51.300 --> 16:55.220
whatever celebrity people target next or whatever, they're probably fake, okay?

16:55.220 --> 16:59.660
It's all probably total lies, run by people who have absolutely no life, who are total

16:59.660 --> 17:02.900
liars, frauds, f***ing losers, etc.

17:02.920 --> 17:06.700
Now, I would argue that fake screenshots can be extremely destructive, and I would always

17:06.700 --> 17:11.060
advise against them, if there are fake screenshots, then it's important that they are called out

17:11.060 --> 17:12.060
when necessary.

17:12.060 --> 17:16.140
However, this seems much more like a way to once again try and implant ideas into his

17:16.140 --> 17:20.900
audience's mind before the storm, that his accusers would not be credible.

17:20.900 --> 17:25.100
He knew this was coming, and instead of setting the record straight when he had the opportunity

17:25.100 --> 17:30.060
to, he puts out these half-truth videos, because he's smug, and he thinks that can work.

17:30.060 --> 17:33.460
You know, all those moments in villain videos, right?

17:33.460 --> 17:37.040
Those movies when they're like, you and me, we're not so different.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.040
That's because they're not.

17:38.040 --> 17:43.740
The villain is just like the hero, they're both focused on the same f***ed up toxic s***.

17:43.740 --> 17:46.500
It's bouncing around their heads, pretty much the same.

17:46.500 --> 17:50.780
They're in the same universe, they're barely even opposing forces.

17:50.780 --> 17:55.660
The hero is just the guy who hasn't f***ed up yet, and then become the enemy of the public,

17:55.660 --> 17:58.220
and then turn villain by the public.

17:58.220 --> 17:59.660
That's how easy it is.

17:59.660 --> 18:03.700
His smugness continued into the drama, as noticed his videos would have some titles

18:03.700 --> 18:07.860
to imply he'd be revealing something, and then boom, he'd hit you with 15 minutes

18:07.860 --> 18:12.100
of unrelated codswallop or existential bollocks, or more of the same stuff that would just

18:12.100 --> 18:16.340
vaguely call out people in an attempt to discredit them, while not actually saying anything of

18:16.340 --> 18:17.340
real substance.

18:17.340 --> 18:23.180
Sup y'all, I have become the bread and butter of a lot of people's dopamine kicks and their

18:23.180 --> 18:24.180
actual income.

18:24.180 --> 18:28.380
My favourite video prior to the meltdown, though, is one by the name of It's Over,

18:28.380 --> 18:31.100
a more direct response to some of the allegations.

18:31.100 --> 18:34.900
He once again picks out various posts that weren't really representative of people's

18:34.900 --> 18:40.220
interests, speaks in a very general language, and including my favourite, if we were guilty

18:40.220 --> 18:43.780
we'd be in jail defence, which is an interesting one for sure.

18:43.780 --> 18:47.780
It's like I said, if the things that people said about Kai were true, then he would be

18:47.780 --> 18:48.780
in jail.

18:48.780 --> 18:53.100
It's so easy, just walk into the police station, you have, you know, something that's open

18:53.100 --> 18:58.540
and closed, obvious, right, allegedly, so, and I feel like, you know, Kai's been proven

18:58.540 --> 19:03.540
innocent, yet nobody cares, and the proof of innocence is the fact that you have someone

19:03.540 --> 19:07.060
who open and closed said a horrible crime occurred, and said that they actually went

19:07.060 --> 19:11.880
to court, their friend said they went to court, and yet Kai remains a free person after they

19:11.880 --> 19:13.060
actually went to court.

19:13.060 --> 19:17.300
He does show some evidence in this video, but I think he actually sneakily twists things

19:17.300 --> 19:18.300
around.

19:18.300 --> 19:22.060
For example, he talks about one person who was caught lying and doing illegal drugs,

19:22.060 --> 19:26.820
seemingly referring to Billy, but then shows screenshots which were dated around 2012,

19:26.820 --> 19:29.620
far before Billy, and therefore that must be Shiloh.

19:29.620 --> 19:32.860
He then follows that up with his comment and corroborating evidence,

19:32.860 --> 19:38.380
Another person was broken up with for literally taking money from me to survive in Canada

19:38.380 --> 19:42.740
while actively sleeping with another person that I didn't know about, and they got pregnant

19:42.740 --> 19:48.060
with that person's baby, okay, so I was like funding their livelihood, and they were actively,

19:48.060 --> 19:49.980
like that's another reason I dumped somebody.

19:49.980 --> 19:54.060
This is obviously a reference to Shiloh again, so he's just shown evidence that twice makes

19:54.060 --> 19:58.340
a case against Shiloh, but acted like he's spoken about two different people, thus trying

19:58.340 --> 20:02.620
to create this sentiment that he's got tons of evidence against so many people, against

20:02.620 --> 20:06.020
all of his accusers, when really he's just challenging one of many.

20:06.020 --> 20:09.940
I will say that the whole payment charade is a bit of an annoyance, but at the same

20:09.940 --> 20:14.500
time Shiloh had already admitted this, and I think many people were aware that she hadn't

20:14.500 --> 20:15.500
paid Greg.

20:15.500 --> 20:18.760
You can argue whether that was the right thing to do or not, but I don't think it necessarily

20:18.760 --> 20:23.420
compromises the claims of mental attrition that Shiloh had been asserting, although Greg

20:23.420 --> 20:25.240
seems to think it does.

20:25.240 --> 20:29.760
I personally disagree, I personally believe that Greg invested monetarily into these people

20:29.760 --> 20:34.240
to create that sense of loyalty, as if he deserved something back, and I think with

20:34.240 --> 20:37.760
the living hell that Shiloh appeared to go through, he got it back.

20:37.760 --> 20:43.140
As for his other accusers, well, Greg isn't legally allowed to talk to them due to NDAs.

20:43.140 --> 20:47.600
This isn't impossible, as he has tried to have other people sign NDAs, but then he really

20:47.640 --> 20:50.680
should sue, that's what NDAs are for.

20:50.680 --> 20:55.400
There's a legal agreement with someone that I can't talk about why I dumped them, that's

20:55.400 --> 20:59.280
why I haven't talked about a lot of things, it's because I actually respect legal agreements

20:59.280 --> 21:03.880
in that regard, so I can't talk about that other reason, but I also, you know, there's

21:03.880 --> 21:04.880
other reasons.

21:04.880 --> 21:10.280
Unfortunately, some people don't respect those agreements, and it's weird, because if they

21:10.280 --> 21:13.720
don't respect a legal agreement, you know, where they publicly acknowledge something

21:13.720 --> 21:17.860
was signed, how can you respect anything they say, something that they admit to having

21:17.860 --> 21:21.800
agreed to, which, you know, if you've ever seen Judge Judy, all you have to do is admit

21:21.800 --> 21:26.040
it happened, and then it becomes valid, like, have you ever heard of a verbal contract?

21:26.040 --> 21:30.140
If you admit to making even a verbal contract, you could be held accountable in court.

21:30.140 --> 21:34.040
But he's not actually going to be suing anyone, because he's not that kind of guy.

21:34.040 --> 21:38.220
Good old gracious Greg doesn't do it for the money, despite asking thousands of dollars

21:38.220 --> 21:41.800
just for an interview with a news outlet, and making copyright claims on multiple videos,

21:41.880 --> 21:44.160
but we don't talk about those examples.

21:44.160 --> 21:47.920
However, speaking about copyright claims, he bites back against those as well.

21:47.920 --> 21:49.560
Let me talk about copyright claims.

21:49.560 --> 21:53.860
So there was this chick who said that she was pursuing me for copyright claims.

21:53.860 --> 21:58.680
She was very upset, because she got copyright claims on a video where I think two or three

21:58.680 --> 22:02.660
of my songs were in it, maybe less, maybe more, but she said she was going to sue me.

22:02.660 --> 22:07.520
And so she took your guys' money, and she flew out here, and she went to a concert,

22:07.520 --> 22:09.180
and then she went home.

22:09.180 --> 22:10.420
That's the story I was told.

22:10.420 --> 22:13.860
That's how serious the people are who talk about copyright claims and me.

22:13.860 --> 22:19.180
You have a person who literally took part in literal fraud right in front of you, and

22:19.180 --> 22:20.900
yet claiming to be the hero.

22:20.900 --> 22:25.820
So he's suggesting here that the point about copyright claims are invalid because people

22:25.820 --> 22:29.460
got scammed by another person using that talking point.

22:29.460 --> 22:30.460
No.

22:30.460 --> 22:31.660
No, Greg.

22:31.660 --> 22:33.600
It does not invalidate it at all.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.060
There are crappy people around.

22:35.060 --> 22:39.380
Doesn't mean you have a right to be claiming videos unjustly, which is what you have been

22:39.380 --> 22:40.660
doing, I must add.

22:40.660 --> 22:45.820
Onision regularly reiterates that these situations are quote, one of many examples, and yet it's

22:45.820 --> 22:50.440
hard to think in multiple instances of any other clear examples that prove his point,

22:50.440 --> 22:52.780
anything that can build on what he's trying to prove.

22:52.780 --> 22:56.680
He also accepts Sarah's invitation to use various posts of information against her,

22:56.680 --> 22:59.100
and trying to use it to once again invalidate these claims.

22:59.100 --> 23:04.420
And that's what's interesting, is nobody respects or, you know, sees the fact that

23:04.420 --> 23:06.620
I actually obey the law.

23:06.620 --> 23:11.540
Like, you got a list of people who, you know, take part in doing illegal drugs, committing

23:11.540 --> 23:15.460
crimes in general, uh, like fraud, and they do all these things, and yet they wind up

23:15.460 --> 23:18.380
being the heroes, which is a mind-boggling thing to me.

23:18.380 --> 23:20.420
Guys, isn't it amazing?

23:20.420 --> 23:26.100
All these people doing drugs, and yet I'm being called a child groomer, whoo, doesn't

23:26.100 --> 23:30.520
quite logically stack up, and with mine to my previous video, it seems possible that

23:30.520 --> 23:34.080
you deliberately coerce people into these positions to use it against them in the future,

23:34.080 --> 23:36.960
but I think that ploy is becoming very transparent now.

23:36.960 --> 23:40.800
Throughout the rest of this video, he mainly shows screenshots only from Shiloh, from around

23:40.800 --> 23:41.800
2012.

23:41.800 --> 23:45.840
He rebuts a couple other claims, such as the idea that he looked up Netjunator's photos,

23:45.840 --> 23:49.720
which he said was public content anyway, I still find it kinda weird he made that whole

23:49.720 --> 23:54.400
video about her, but he ultimately finishes stating that he's not controlling, not oppressive,

23:54.400 --> 23:57.620
but he is manipulative, and do you know why he's manipulative?

23:57.620 --> 23:59.680
Because everyone is manipulative.

23:59.720 --> 24:06.560
Manipulative, everyone is manipulative, everyone, and you guys don't realize it, but you are.

24:06.560 --> 24:08.880
You're manipulative in the way that you take a position on anything.

24:08.880 --> 24:14.120
For instance, if you are a supporter of Trump, you will automatically view facts as different

24:14.120 --> 24:16.520
than everyone else, because you have that bias.

24:16.520 --> 24:17.960
Bias makes us manipulative.

24:17.960 --> 24:22.160
But I feel like I'm dealing with a bunch of people who just wanna see me fail, so they're

24:22.160 --> 24:24.260
not gonna hear anything I just said.

24:24.260 --> 24:26.880
They're just gonna hear the part where I say, everyone's manipulative, and they're gonna

24:26.880 --> 24:31.640
be like, oh, well, he admits it, he's manipulative, and it doesn't become a human conversation,

24:31.640 --> 24:36.000
it just maintains as a ridiculous, outraged culture, reactional thing.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.200
Well, let's keep that in mind as we go into the next part.

24:39.200 --> 25:01.060
It's Over was mainly a video aimed at attacking Shiloh for some nondescript reason.

25:01.060 --> 25:05.340
Even when he's dealing with other allegations such as the ones that Kaiser Groomer, most

25:05.340 --> 25:10.440
notably advocated by Sarah, he immediately turns it on Shiloh, and about her fake miscarriage.

25:35.340 --> 25:50.620
I'm not gonna defend those actions, I'd argue that such behaviour could cause a lot of upset,

25:50.620 --> 25:55.660
but once again, as a response, it's logically ineffective, first because Shiloh was clearly

25:55.660 --> 26:00.220
mentally unstable at that point, and this was less than a whole month after the whole

26:00.220 --> 26:04.660
Shiloh Forgot Me debacle in which you highlighted how unstable she was, and that doesn't really

26:04.660 --> 26:09.900
change the reliability of a modern day accusation, other than the fact that she may misremember

26:09.900 --> 26:14.320
it, it certainly doesn't affect her credibility as a proponent, in spite of the claims that

26:14.320 --> 26:18.900
she is a quote self-admitted pathological liar, something that I found very little evidence

26:18.900 --> 26:24.140
of, bar your own math, and secondly, and most importantly, because Shiloh isn't even the

26:24.140 --> 26:43.020
main proponent of this narrative.

26:43.020 --> 26:48.300
But ultimately, what I think sums up this video best, is this scrappily organised point,

26:48.300 --> 26:52.900
where he talks about someone sending an email to Kai, warning him about Greg, but then shows

26:52.900 --> 26:57.700
an image which I think is meant to be an email from someone attacking Shiloh, he obviously

26:57.700 --> 27:02.740
forgets to censor her name once, despite doing it throughout the rest of the email, oopsie,

27:02.740 --> 27:07.020
I don't even know what he's on at this point. This is the sort of explanation that

27:07.020 --> 27:11.480
Onision knew would only fly with the loyalists, but those were the people he was appealing

27:11.480 --> 27:17.220
to, he didn't even expect viewers to read the damn text. Onision was smug as all hell,

27:17.220 --> 27:21.020
his responses were rubbish, but they showed an arrogance that he felt untouchable, and

27:21.020 --> 27:25.260
he was allowed to be slightly sloppy on the details as long as people didn't care, he'd

27:25.260 --> 27:30.260
do these mocking tweets of Chris Hansen, he was provoking people, and they reacted, however

27:30.260 --> 27:34.420
as noted, the attention was slightly more committed at this time, and our good friend

27:34.420 --> 27:37.420
Sir Onion was about to be taken down a peg.

27:37.420 --> 27:41.580
This all started on the 21st of November, when he was informed that he was under investigation

27:41.580 --> 27:46.500
from the FBI, he uploads a video basically having a meltdown, it's just him falling

27:46.500 --> 27:51.740
apart on camera, making nonsensical comments, personally speaking, it's not the most enjoyable

27:51.740 --> 27:52.740
watch.

27:52.740 --> 28:11.900
Now we'll talk about legality in due time, but there is a more pressing situation to

28:11.900 --> 28:16.020
talk about, and that was obviously the fall of his Patreon. Onision was still making a

28:16.020 --> 28:19.680
decent amount of money from his Patreon, most likely from people who had forgotten

28:19.680 --> 28:24.140
to stop donating, maybe some people had died, I don't know, he's been on the platform

28:24.140 --> 28:29.020
long enough, but whatever, that paywall was a significant power play that enabled him

28:29.020 --> 28:33.940
to make content and control a narrative in a place where he wasn't as wildly hated,

28:33.940 --> 28:38.300
it also gave him a small amount of individuals who were more devoted for him. This was probably

28:38.300 --> 28:42.940
what made him so chipper, that thought of constant income, however with the public pressure

28:42.940 --> 28:47.420
and the serious authority behind this public pressure, Onion Man should have been a little

28:47.420 --> 28:51.940
more careful. Why is this? Well apparently on the 24th of November, he decided that it

28:51.940 --> 28:56.440
would be a good idea to post text from Billy. Okay, well it's been a fairly consistent mud

28:56.440 --> 29:00.440
slinging contest between all parties, you can't be surprised there, so he posts the

29:00.440 --> 29:05.040
text with the captions alongside stating that even if you were a liar, it didn't justify

29:05.040 --> 29:08.860
his cruel behaviour. It once again gave me the impression that he was just trying to

29:08.860 --> 29:12.780
stay one step ahead of the allegations while trying to discredit other parties, however

29:12.780 --> 29:17.620
foolishly Onision posted an image that included Billy's phone number. Now many have alleged

29:17.620 --> 29:21.620
that this was done to inspire harassment, and to be honest, I wouldn't put it past

29:21.620 --> 29:25.340
him, but the tweet was deleted not too long after. Nonetheless, the post was up there

29:25.340 --> 29:29.540
long enough for people to bring Patreon's attention to it. Patreon have a habit of looking

29:29.540 --> 29:33.780
for a reason to ban people they don't like, and honestly, out of everything he has done,

29:33.780 --> 29:37.460
this probably wouldn't be the top of the priority list for many people, however this

29:37.460 --> 29:41.940
was the most concrete act of wrongdoing that Patreon could identify, and even though it

29:41.940 --> 29:46.620
was on another platform who didn't actually act on it themselves, Patreon shut Onision

29:46.620 --> 29:48.180
down, and that did not go well.

29:48.180 --> 29:57.340
Onision Wow. Wow. Wow. So you guys are so into yourselves, like you are so committed

29:57.340 --> 30:03.100
to censoring innocent people, that you're just gonna go and try to get my Patreon deleted

30:04.020 --> 30:07.820
He very quickly uploaded this video called Wow, which once again, contained the somewhat

30:07.820 --> 30:12.740
unstable ramblings of an individual who clearly was upset that his Patreon had been removed.

30:12.740 --> 30:16.460
Now on principle, I would say that some of the rules have been a bit bent to achieve

30:16.460 --> 30:20.780
this specific result, but as a component of the greater situation, then there's no real

30:20.780 --> 30:24.780
doubt he should have been removed. Patreon was a real way that he could easily use to

30:24.780 --> 30:28.620
find more loyal individuals, isolate them in the way he seemed prior, and he's been

30:28.620 --> 30:33.460
called out for this again, and again, and again, and he has not learned, and therefore

30:33.460 --> 30:37.300
they should be questioning his ability to hold the platform at least, and probably removing

30:37.300 --> 30:38.300
it altogether.

30:38.300 --> 30:41.300
Of course, Onision didn't really appreciate this line of reasoning.

30:41.300 --> 30:50.300
Onision You tried to do the FBI, it didn't work! You tried to do the police, it didn't work!

30:50.700 --> 30:58.700
So instead, he resorts to the paycheck, and you got it! You got it!

30:58.700 --> 31:00.700
But he doesn't have to appreciate it.

31:00.700 --> 31:04.940
As said, I'm unsure of the outcome of an FBI investigation, but regardless of whether there

31:04.940 --> 31:09.140
ends up being an actual criminal conviction or not, does not mean no wrongdoing has been

31:09.140 --> 31:10.140
committed.

31:10.140 --> 31:13.460
I've covered many people whose behaviour I would class as rather inexcusable, but that

31:13.460 --> 31:18.140
does not mean they've conducted anything criminally illegal, and given the testimonies that say

31:18.140 --> 31:22.460
Onision has a way of working around the law, it makes sense he'd use this defence.

31:22.460 --> 31:26.980
Onision's video itself is also interspersed with rather erratic behaviour, spontaneous

31:26.980 --> 31:29.340
screams, and mood swings galore.

31:29.340 --> 31:33.340
It's certainly a spectacle, in fact, this pattern of behaviour has been repeated continuously

31:33.340 --> 31:38.660
in his uploads, to the point where various users have been setting up Onision Bingo.

31:38.660 --> 31:42.180
Over the videos following the deletion of his Patreon, he documented multiple events

31:42.180 --> 31:46.400
that seemed to worsen his standard of living, for example, Kai was seeking the dissolution

31:46.400 --> 31:50.440
of the marriage, he was having to sell all his belongings, he was being kicked out of

31:50.440 --> 31:52.840
his apartment, he was losing everything.

31:52.840 --> 31:58.240
But why on earth was this all happening, and what do I really think is going on?

31:58.240 --> 32:04.840
A large part of why I'm so active online is to keep the attention of others so I feel

32:04.840 --> 32:08.200
not only appreciated but retain a false sense of value in myself.

32:08.200 --> 32:14.080
In reality, I'm socially abrasive, emotionally conflicted, and despite my inflated ego, I

32:15.080 --> 32:24.240
Onision is not a regular person, I don't think you need a behavioural expert to tell

32:24.240 --> 32:28.320
you that, and his breakdown videos exhibited content that wouldn't be expected from a

32:28.320 --> 32:33.660
rational being, however many people hypothesized at the time this was all an act, and rightfully

32:33.660 --> 32:34.660
so.

32:34.660 --> 32:38.440
It's purpose, though, is unclear, although some have stated that it might be so he could

32:38.440 --> 32:41.720
plead insanity if any cases actually went to court.

32:41.720 --> 32:45.680
Now I don't know if that was the case, but I had my own little theory for exactly what

32:45.680 --> 32:46.680
was happening.

32:46.680 --> 32:51.040
We have this situation, and we now know that this drama is different from the rest, this

32:51.040 --> 32:55.160
one is having more of a profound effect on people's pockets, and that is obviously

32:55.160 --> 32:59.920
going to upset Onision here, so the fact that he's pissed off is natural, but as noted

32:59.920 --> 33:01.360
it doesn't stop there.

33:01.360 --> 33:06.000
The one thing that Onision has always wanted were views, it's always been about views,

33:06.000 --> 33:11.640
views make his world go round, and when watching this saga of videos, one clip always stuck

33:11.640 --> 33:23.320
out to me, and that's the thing, in a way, it is exactly what people wanted, people

33:23.320 --> 33:28.740
who are likely upset, angry, and indignant about what Onision has done want to see him

33:28.740 --> 33:32.040
pay, and Onision was giving the people what they wanted.

33:32.040 --> 33:35.840
For me, it's not exactly what I wanted, I will obviously talk about what I wanted in

33:35.840 --> 33:40.040
due course, but I'd bring attention to the fact that many of these videos still managed

33:40.040 --> 33:41.040
to be monetised.

33:41.040 --> 33:45.440
Now, many of Onision's uploads since this time follow a similar structure, they start

33:45.440 --> 33:49.720
off with him behaving in a relatively calm manner, and then after a minute or so, devolve

33:49.720 --> 33:53.160
into this insanity that people clearly find the most entertaining.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.160
Why is this?

33:54.160 --> 33:58.160
Well, it's likely because if you submit a video for manual review when it gets demonetised,

33:58.160 --> 34:03.000
the reviewers will not watch the whole video, they will most likely analyse the title, thumbnail,

34:03.000 --> 34:05.640
description, tags, and maybe watch the first minute.

34:05.640 --> 34:09.520
Of course, if they watch for an amount and see Onision behaving in a relatively calm

34:09.520 --> 34:12.560
manner, they are more likely to leave the video monetised.

34:12.560 --> 34:18.080
Also note how Onision was using vague, ambiguous titles, and not ones that are outwardly inflammatory,

34:18.080 --> 34:20.760
giving the algorithms as little to pick up on as possible.

34:20.760 --> 34:25.040
I personally believe that this run of uploads was a ploy to make money, that may not be

34:25.040 --> 34:28.700
true, and I wouldn't necessarily urge people to say it as a truth, but I would make the

34:28.700 --> 34:33.280
statement that with this in mind, it's still clear that he wants the attention.

34:33.280 --> 34:37.160
In one of his videos, shortly after he claimed to have been kicked out of his house, he asked

34:37.160 --> 34:39.160
audience this question.

34:39.160 --> 34:41.160
What if I am mentally ill?

34:41.160 --> 34:43.160
What if I'm sick?

34:43.160 --> 34:45.160
What if I'm mentally ill, huh?

34:45.160 --> 34:47.160
What if?

34:47.160 --> 34:49.160
Okay, then you're making fun of a handicapped person.

34:49.160 --> 34:50.160
Do you understand that?

34:50.160 --> 34:54.160
And I want to clarify, I didn't find this funny, I didn't find this particularly amusing,

34:54.160 --> 34:57.160
I found it rather uncomfortable, I think a lot of people did too.

34:57.160 --> 35:03.280
I often found Onision interspersing this insanity with a narrative, one of blaming others for

35:03.280 --> 35:05.740
reacting to him behaving in such a way.

35:05.740 --> 35:09.580
Now for the record, I think you have to be sensitive around people acting like this,

35:09.580 --> 35:14.500
but at the same time, this doesn't mean you forfeit all responsibility for your actions,

35:14.500 --> 35:19.500
and if I aim to look at your situation from the most cold, detached perspective, the conclusion

35:19.500 --> 35:22.180
remains the same, you shouldn't have a platform.

35:22.180 --> 35:27.500
Onision also intertwines these videos with self-promotion and plug, such as Onisionfans.com,

35:27.500 --> 35:32.100
which appears to be a redirect to the subscription page for Uh Oh Bro, another mess that we will

35:32.100 --> 35:34.260
have to place under the microscope soon.

35:34.300 --> 35:39.500
He mentions at one point he has a cameo too, which he does, and he's charging a meaty 60 dollars

35:39.500 --> 35:43.500
for gigs on that, which some people have actually taken him up on. Delightful.

35:43.500 --> 35:47.500
As you guys may or may not know, I have a cameo, and um...

35:47.500 --> 35:52.220
This newer set of videos, although erratic, also seem quite organised, and with the intent

35:52.220 --> 35:54.060
to promote his other content.

35:54.060 --> 35:58.220
This didn't mean he was mentally well, it may mean that the problem still persists behind

35:58.220 --> 35:59.220
the scenes.

35:59.220 --> 36:03.360
In one of his newer videos, simply called Dissolution, another video that is still monetised

36:03.400 --> 36:07.240
on writing this, he states that his husband Kai has filed for the dissolution of their

36:07.240 --> 36:08.240
marriage.

36:08.240 --> 36:11.840
It follows a similar formula, he talks about it, stays quiet for a bit, and then has another

36:11.840 --> 36:13.480
episode in the car.

36:13.480 --> 36:18.460
Of course, the document was completely fake, so that went nowhere, but suddenly he's sleeping

36:18.460 --> 36:22.600
in a box with apple juice he obtained, then he has to stay in a cheap hotel, and then

36:22.600 --> 36:26.360
he's in a cupboard, and it's all your fault.

36:26.360 --> 36:38.280
So I guess all those videos where people are saying that I'm the final fall, and that

36:38.280 --> 36:42.280
my life is over, and I've gone to a new low, and I'm so pathetic.

36:42.280 --> 36:46.600
At the time, I didn't believe the circumstances that he was portraying, and I believed it

36:46.600 --> 36:51.280
was an attempt in part to pander to the people who hate him, and in part to try and turn

36:51.280 --> 36:53.040
blame and criticism onto them.

36:53.040 --> 36:57.120
The interchange between this narrative and the insanity, which was meant to be the evidence

36:57.120 --> 37:02.880
of his instability and his suffering, a lot of people were tuning in for that, but honestly,

37:02.880 --> 37:06.680
with this all in mind, that should not be the focus, when I was watching these videos,

37:06.680 --> 37:10.560
it was easy to lose track of what happened in the first place, but you go and look back

37:10.560 --> 37:15.120
on what he's done, and the fact that he's lost his Patreon has to be somewhat detached

37:15.120 --> 37:19.680
from his reaction, and people should make sure it is detached by not necessarily feeding

37:19.680 --> 37:20.780
this content.

37:20.780 --> 37:25.280
His narrative focused on the fact that people keep talking about him, and he wanted people

37:25.280 --> 37:29.160
to focus on that, and how little control he claimed to have.

37:29.160 --> 37:33.400
The general principle of proportional punishment is something that should stand, people like

37:33.400 --> 37:37.620
to see others face consequences for what they've done, but not to an extent that may hurt them

37:37.620 --> 37:38.620
beyond their actions.

37:39.620 --> 37:46.620
I live in a tent, and you guys are sitting there going, we're so much better than him,

37:46.620 --> 37:55.820
he's a loser, look at him, this helpless person, who has no chance of defending himself, ever!

37:55.820 --> 38:00.320
Onision was trying to show the punishment he's faced was disproportionate, and brought

38:00.320 --> 38:04.620
on by mob mentality and cancel culture, when in reality, all that he has lost thus far

38:04.620 --> 38:09.580
directly from his critics were his Patreon, a consequence that I and many others would

38:09.580 --> 38:13.820
argue is fair enough, and suddenly because he's losing this, he was out of a house,

38:13.820 --> 38:16.680
his spouse was divorcing him, he was losing everything.

38:16.680 --> 38:20.800
Some people believe this, but most people doubted him, pointing out the wetland environment

38:20.800 --> 38:25.140
he was thinking, or the stock divorce document, so eventually in the new year he made a video

38:25.140 --> 38:28.500
called Hi, stating that it was all actually an act.

38:28.500 --> 38:33.540
He then made another video talking about how he wishes people would cover the real issues.

38:33.540 --> 38:36.700
What you have here is cancel culture in a nutshell.

38:36.700 --> 38:38.140
You have the source of it.

38:38.140 --> 38:42.060
If you have an algorithm that promotes what people want to hear, and doesn't promote

38:42.060 --> 38:46.100
what they don't want to hear, you have a propaganda machine.

38:46.100 --> 38:49.780
You don't have a machine that promotes the truth anymore, you don't have a machine

38:49.780 --> 38:59.140
that promotes what actually happens, you have a machine that panders to the most immature

38:59.140 --> 39:04.680
and difficult to respect aspects of human selfishness.

39:04.680 --> 39:09.320
We establish the idea that Onision has three main goals, to frame himself as the victim,

39:09.320 --> 39:12.500
to distract from serious allegations, and to farm views.

39:12.500 --> 39:16.660
Chances are he'll keep rotating these ideas while altering the tone and delivery, providing

39:16.660 --> 39:21.040
the illusion that he is presenting something new, but I doubt anything new of value will

39:21.040 --> 39:22.040
be said.

39:22.040 --> 39:26.220
This is exactly how I would describe his recent run of uploaded responses, which is this endless

39:26.220 --> 39:30.780
stream of content, where he talks very vaguely, splits it purposefully up into multiple videos,

39:30.780 --> 39:32.940
and uploads it on a nauseatingly regular basis.

39:32.940 --> 39:38.180
Many of these videos are practically unwatchable, and include him providing almost purely anecdotal

39:38.180 --> 39:42.660
evidence and ad hominem attacks in an attempt to discredit his critics, while also making

39:42.660 --> 39:45.060
some very bizarre comments himself.

39:45.060 --> 39:48.860
So when you have people who are attracted to 18 and 19 year olds, you're talking about

39:48.860 --> 39:53.580
people who are attracted to people who are at the premium age for breeding, and that

39:53.580 --> 39:55.500
is on a scientific level.

39:55.500 --> 40:01.160
So we like to social justice warrior shame people for being attracted to people who are

40:01.160 --> 40:05.620
actually at the premium age of breeding, which is 18, 19, and if you want to be outraged

40:05.620 --> 40:09.020
by science, that's fine, be outraged by science, be an idiot.

40:09.020 --> 40:12.780
On top of the monetary motivation of so many uploads, and the copyright claims he can probably

40:12.780 --> 40:17.280
file, Onision knows how to make an efficient response video, and to me, is purposely stretching

40:17.280 --> 40:21.080
these videos to try and make his critics just give up on him, bring us to the point where

40:21.080 --> 40:25.420
he can turn around and say, see, these people didn't watch my responses, how can they respond

40:25.420 --> 40:26.420
to me anymore?

40:26.420 --> 40:30.300
Fortunately, there have been people out there actually responding to these videos and pointing

40:30.300 --> 40:32.180
out some of their problems.

40:32.180 --> 40:36.120
Recently Onision made a video where he shows quote receipts, some people have questioned

40:36.120 --> 40:39.840
whether they are real or not, but for me, I assume they are, because they're pretty

40:39.840 --> 40:40.840
weak.

40:40.840 --> 40:44.540
A fair portion of the video are texts from Sarah telling Kai that he's not a groomer,

40:44.540 --> 40:49.900
which judging from the few messages that are dated, land around 2017, 2018, and the start

40:49.900 --> 40:51.320
of 2019.

40:51.320 --> 40:56.020
Sarah was publicly defending Kai at that point regardless, and everyone knows that, so what

40:56.020 --> 40:57.200
is his point here?

40:57.200 --> 40:58.480
I'm not entirely sure.

40:58.480 --> 41:03.640
At one point he claims that these DMs are Sarah attempting to groom Kai, which I don't

41:03.640 --> 41:07.800
really see and I've looked at it like ten times now, maybe it's because I'm on two hours

41:07.800 --> 41:08.880
of sleep, I don't know.

41:08.880 --> 41:13.840
He also makes a brilliant, fantastic point where he shows a message from Kai accusing

41:13.840 --> 41:14.840
Billy of lying.

41:14.840 --> 41:19.180
Here we only see Billy's very brief immediate response, and I cannot say whether there was

41:19.180 --> 41:22.940
a more elaborate response that followed, at this point Greg then shows alternative

41:22.940 --> 41:28.240
DMs of Billy saying she holds a grudge, before Onision then claims that as she's admitted

41:28.240 --> 41:33.980
to lying, I guess, and given the fact that she has a grudge, she must be lying now.

41:33.980 --> 41:38.620
Now you don't need a logical genius to debunk this claim, the average person lies during

41:38.620 --> 41:42.720
the day, it's just people lie on different levels with different gravity.

41:42.720 --> 41:47.900
The grudge wouldn't have helped, but a grudge doesn't necessarily mean a lie, and regardless,

41:47.900 --> 41:51.780
Billy's claims were quite mild, probably the mildest, just about how it was a really

41:51.780 --> 41:56.620
messed up dynamic, and how temperamental your behaviour was, where she backed up with some

41:56.620 --> 42:00.540
pretty compelling evidence, more compelling than yours, she admitted in her tweet that

42:00.540 --> 42:02.300
she wasn't fully in the right.

42:02.300 --> 42:06.540
Yeah, you're going for her credibility, but I don't know what you discredit like this,

42:06.540 --> 42:10.540
unless you're seriously implying that because someone lied to you about smoking weed, that

42:10.540 --> 42:15.220
some evidence-based claims and some other rather mild claims are invalidated.

42:15.220 --> 42:20.600
Not satisfied with one, Onision then uploads another video where he talks more about Sarah,

42:20.600 --> 42:25.120
in between showing DMs that he claims as evidence against the notion that Kai sent news to Sarah,

42:25.120 --> 42:29.460
which I personally find uncompelling, and using a Venmo situation in which Sarah was

42:29.460 --> 42:34.900
involved in against her, which was quite poorly handled, to be fair, basically he gets really

42:34.900 --> 42:39.600
mad, right in the middle, calling everyone stupid because Sarah's blooper video is

42:39.600 --> 42:42.900
so clearly fake, because of obvious reasons.

42:42.900 --> 42:46.840
You guys are so stupid, so so stupid.

42:46.840 --> 42:50.260
You didn't even notice that her hair is a different length.

42:50.260 --> 42:51.540
Did any of you notice that?

42:51.540 --> 42:57.100
Her blooper video, which she recorded months after the first video, while telling all of

42:57.100 --> 43:01.980
you that she recorded it the same day, different hair length.

43:01.980 --> 43:03.500
How could you people miss that?

43:03.500 --> 43:09.820
You are so stupid, and she's already proven without a doubt guilty of being a slanderous

43:09.820 --> 43:10.820
liar.

43:10.820 --> 43:15.140
I just wanna say, I am really tired at this point of Greg and his BS.

43:15.140 --> 43:19.540
Firstly, the video uploaded onto Onision's channel clearly has a lighter filter, and

43:19.540 --> 43:22.900
has light from a different angle which would explain colour differences, unless she's

43:22.900 --> 43:24.420
made her beanie brighter too.

43:24.420 --> 43:28.180
Sarah actually mentions this herself, in a tweet where she explains she added a filter

43:28.180 --> 43:29.520
to hide the emotion.

43:29.520 --> 43:33.460
It's hard to tell the length of the hair because of the angles and the fact that she's

43:33.460 --> 43:35.660
changed her position with regards to the beanie.

43:35.660 --> 43:39.800
Sarah's brunette hair comes round her cheeks, while the blonde goes down her shoulder.

43:39.800 --> 43:42.280
This is recognisable in both the videos.

43:42.280 --> 43:45.960
It's hard to spot on the Onision upload, and it's hard to see where it starts and

43:45.960 --> 43:50.840
ends because of the lighter filter, and the fact that it's position is adjusted a little,

43:50.840 --> 43:54.080
she's moved it back, but you can see it, especially when it moves.

43:54.080 --> 43:58.600
Now, I'm not saying that this proves the video is real, but moving room, trying to

43:58.600 --> 44:00.920
compose yourself, adding a filter, plausible.

44:00.920 --> 44:05.680
Also, if we wanted to talk about receipts, because Onision loves proof, in one of the

44:05.680 --> 44:10.000
first texts released by Sarah, you can see a cut off text where Sarah says she's having

44:10.000 --> 44:12.680
a rough time with regards to making this video.

44:12.680 --> 44:17.000
Once again, not definitive proof, but do not let Onision trick you into thinking this is

44:17.000 --> 44:21.240
some open and shut case where he gets to be all mad at your gullibility when he knows

44:21.240 --> 44:23.640
damn well the alternative explanations.

44:23.640 --> 44:28.800
This situation isn't simple, he is trying to express anger to convey certainty, it's

44:28.800 --> 44:30.400
textbook emotional manipulation.

44:30.400 --> 44:33.480
This is not a gotcha moment, he is just an actor.

44:34.000 --> 44:39.440
Listen, I can't respond to every one of Onision's videos, as fun as it would be, I'm sure

44:39.440 --> 44:45.040
this isn't his last, but making other people out as bad won't make you good, and I'm

44:45.040 --> 44:49.200
not here to argue that everyone involved is good, I probably wouldn't end up being a

44:49.200 --> 44:54.420
fantastic human being either if I had to endure Onision, there are videos out there more focused

44:54.420 --> 44:58.400
on his accusers, and you can make that judgement for yourself.

44:58.400 --> 45:03.460
My main quarrel is, and will probably always be with Gregory, I even left a comment on

45:03.460 --> 45:07.180
the video highlighting my problems through a throwaway account.

45:07.180 --> 45:11.260
It disappeared immediately, I assume he's got a filter on, I do not know if it's up

45:11.260 --> 45:15.540
at the time of recording, what I do know is that right now the comments left are almost

45:15.540 --> 45:20.060
universally positive, so he's definitely using some sort of filter currently, and as

45:20.060 --> 45:23.860
well as that, it feels like he's trying to keep attention on his other channel to

45:23.860 --> 45:25.860
distract his critics.

45:25.860 --> 45:28.140
What is he trying to distract people from?

45:28.140 --> 45:29.140
Let's find out.

45:33.460 --> 45:37.260
I do not expect to be embraced as if this is all okay, and my unhealthy social attitude

45:37.260 --> 45:44.140
is somehow acceptable, it's not, feeling relief from forgiveness is for those who possess

45:44.140 --> 45:48.540
faith, I am not one of those people, I cannot be forgiven.

45:48.540 --> 45:52.860
I don't like what Onision is doing, even if I am sensitive to his mental state, I don't

45:52.860 --> 45:56.280
think he should have a platform to do it, this doesn't mean I agree with everything

45:56.280 --> 46:00.380
that people do in response, people should be relatively careful, for example in a recent

46:00.380 --> 46:04.300
video called Baby Carrot, he rants about people who've allegedly mocked his penis

46:04.300 --> 46:06.420
comparing it to a baby carrot.

46:06.420 --> 46:09.660
Now this is a new one to me, but let's just take it for an example.

46:09.660 --> 46:15.780
In this video, for a brief moment, he flashes his quote, baby carrot, and some people notice.

46:15.780 --> 46:20.620
Now to be fair, the main goal of people who reacted to this was to report it for pornographic

46:20.620 --> 46:24.840
content, which was within their rights, but once again Onision removed this very quickly,

46:24.840 --> 46:28.760
and then, a few days later, uploaded another video where he complains about this.

46:49.760 --> 46:54.080
Once again, it seems like an exaggeration, as actually, I couldn't find too many posts

46:54.080 --> 46:58.680
about it, but I'd argue that these quote blunders are being done for two purposes,

46:58.680 --> 47:03.420
firstly to emphasise victimisation, and secondly to make sure people stay distracted, because

47:03.420 --> 47:07.680
although some people may take pleasure in his Patreon being deactivated, and all these

47:07.680 --> 47:12.100
subsequent antics, they provide nothing of substance, and nothing that really aids the

47:12.100 --> 47:13.960
allegations beyond that.

47:13.960 --> 47:18.200
Ultimately, it does not circumvent the full problem, I do wonder if he wants people to

47:18.200 --> 47:22.180
think he's losing everything so they take an eye off him, but that is far from the truth,

47:22.180 --> 47:24.540
which is where we'll turn our focus now.

47:24.540 --> 47:28.820
When I made my video around this time last year on DaddyOFive, I said what they'd done

47:28.820 --> 47:33.260
after being kicked off YouTube was isolate their remaining audience and make content

47:33.260 --> 47:37.580
for them on a separate website, it allowed them to still function above criticism, and

47:37.580 --> 47:40.700
ultimately there was very little that could be done about that.

47:40.700 --> 47:45.140
Now Onision being widely hated may be seen as a victory for some, but it also means that

47:45.140 --> 47:50.300
once again, people can be easily isolated if he ceases to use platforms so openly.

47:50.300 --> 47:55.140
For example, at the end of his videos currently, he shows this, an end card, with the inscription

47:55.140 --> 48:00.540
of Onisionfans.com, in the bottom corner you will see some names, now it took me a moment

48:00.540 --> 48:04.340
and a search to understand what these names represented, but they were the new subscribers

48:04.340 --> 48:09.140
of Onisionfans.com, and by the most recent video he has a significant amount of names

48:09.140 --> 48:10.440
on the end card.

48:10.440 --> 48:14.300
Of course, in many of these videos he cries about how few supporters he has, but that's

48:14.300 --> 48:16.620
certainly not a number to be sneered at.

48:16.620 --> 48:19.100
Okay, but how much are they donating?

48:19.100 --> 48:21.060
Petty cash won't make much difference at this point.

48:21.060 --> 48:24.860
Well, I had a gander at this reward scheme after clicking on the link myself, and to

48:24.860 --> 48:29.700
have your name in the credits at the end of a video, you need to be donating the equivalent

48:29.700 --> 48:31.820
of 35 pounds a month.

48:31.820 --> 48:36.900
Now 35 times to all these people is a significant amount, I must add a caveat that the number

48:36.900 --> 48:41.700
of people included in the credits increased significantly following one specific video,

48:41.700 --> 48:45.420
so I don't know if he updated it for that month, or if he just started including people

48:45.420 --> 48:49.500
who were donating less, but either way, he is making a fair amount of income.

48:49.500 --> 48:53.740
On his Discord server, the members rank has at least 50 people, and that's only the people

48:53.740 --> 48:55.180
who I've seen online.

48:55.180 --> 48:59.740
The minimum donation is 5 quid, so it's fair to say he's at least making a few hundred

48:59.740 --> 49:04.320
quid a month on this medium alone, that's obviously excluding all the YouTube videos

49:04.320 --> 49:09.060
he still has up and monetised, even the old ones which are still getting hits.

49:09.060 --> 49:12.880
I'd also like to add that people who are concerned about the elite tiers may have decent reason

49:12.880 --> 49:14.540
beyond the amount of money it makes.

49:14.660 --> 49:19.860
For two tiers, he advertises one on one calls with the man himself, firstly on Discord for

49:19.860 --> 49:23.800
those who are willing to pay, and then on Skype for the real high rollers.

49:23.800 --> 49:27.340
You know the medium in which he connected with a lot of his former accusers?

49:27.340 --> 49:32.140
Only highly committed fans are likely to be willing to pay for something as pricey as

49:32.140 --> 49:35.940
that, and as mentioned, those are the sorts of people that Onision will be targeting.

49:35.940 --> 49:39.900
Now I don't know if Onision is willing to take his chances at this point, but given

49:39.900 --> 49:42.880
his track record, I don't think there's a chance that platforms should be willing

49:42.880 --> 49:43.880
to take.

49:43.920 --> 49:47.800
You may all be clowning on Onision on his main channel, but I don't believe he's

49:47.800 --> 49:50.000
as down on his luck as he portrays himself.

49:50.000 --> 49:54.040
I know it sounds messed up that people would be into him at this point, and even vulnerable

49:54.040 --> 49:58.700
to his antics after all these exposed videos, but some of the most messed up people had

49:58.700 --> 50:02.320
hordes of fangirls, you just don't know what people are into.

50:02.320 --> 50:06.680
I think he wants to give people a false sense of security that they may have justice at

50:06.680 --> 50:10.720
one point in the hope that the criticism, and the calls for YouTube to deplatform him

50:10.720 --> 50:11.760
may lay off.

50:11.760 --> 50:15.360
He thinks if he can portray enough suffering, then people may become bored.

50:15.360 --> 50:16.880
I think that is quite foolish.

50:16.880 --> 50:20.720
People are aware of the prime source of his income, and most notably power.

50:20.720 --> 50:24.800
Even if Onision was making no money from YouTube at all, people would still want his channel

50:24.800 --> 50:28.560
removed because it's not about the money, it's about the power.

50:28.560 --> 50:33.620
Even the subscriber count, and the fans alone, will provide him with some level of that.

50:33.620 --> 50:37.720
Many days during these quote breakdowns, he conducted these very casual streams with his

50:37.720 --> 50:41.600
donors that are completely accessible at the time to the public, though they have been

50:41.600 --> 50:42.600
privated since.

50:42.600 --> 50:46.640
And although it's easy to frame him as if he's falling apart as a person, especially

50:46.640 --> 50:50.640
with the recent deletion of his Patreon, I'd also say that by doing that, you give your

50:50.640 --> 50:54.360
audience a false sense of accomplishment, when really, from my judgement, there are

50:54.360 --> 50:59.600
a lot of exceptions here, and he's still using the situation to build something else.

50:59.600 --> 51:03.600
And even if he has lost everything, then it should make these ventures seem more precarious

51:03.600 --> 51:07.060
in many ways, because then you're dealing with someone who has much less to lose and

51:07.060 --> 51:10.020
will act more desperately to obtain those goals.

51:10.020 --> 51:15.300
Onision appears to be slowly closing off from the world, and granting people exclusive access.

51:15.300 --> 51:20.060
Publicly, it looks like he's doing awfully, but if less people can see what's going on,

51:20.060 --> 51:22.980
well, the problem is self explanatory at that point.

51:22.980 --> 51:24.580
But I don't think it's that.

51:24.580 --> 51:26.020
Don't fall for the bait.

51:26.020 --> 51:30.220
This video has been primarily focused on his response, but I'm also telling you that you

51:30.220 --> 51:34.700
don't want to become too focused on one element on this story alone, because you risk falling

51:34.700 --> 51:38.660
out of touch with what he's actually done, and there are plenty of videos documenting

51:38.660 --> 51:42.620
that, earlier instalments of my own included.

51:42.620 --> 51:48.540
Onision had been invited on Chris Hansen's show, and demanded $350,000 to go on.

51:48.540 --> 51:53.260
He also demanded $10,000 from a news outlet for an interview, and he's asking for a subscription

51:53.260 --> 51:56.180
fee to be able to speak in a Discord chat.

51:56.180 --> 51:59.900
He may not be here for a long time, but it won't stop him attempting to make a quick

51:59.900 --> 52:01.660
buck off the attention.

52:01.660 --> 52:03.460
Stay aware of that.

52:03.700 --> 52:06.700
And with this in mind, let's move on to the next part.

52:09.700 --> 52:12.660
When you're a YouTuber, it's basically like the most narcissistic job in the world.

52:12.660 --> 52:13.900
Hey, everyone, look at me.

52:13.900 --> 52:17.580
You have never, and probably will never encounter a more real YouTuber.

52:19.300 --> 52:21.540
I've pretended to be such a good person for most of my life.

52:23.220 --> 52:26.740
I've been trying to convince myself I'm a hero, and in reality, I'm just the most foolish

52:26.740 --> 52:29.140
person in the world with a version of yourself that doesn't exist.

52:33.460 --> 52:41.700
I don't really want to take too much focus away from what Onision's done, though it

52:41.700 --> 52:44.460
is important to analyse his responses as well.

52:44.460 --> 52:48.260
Since this drama has arisen, he has contacted various parties involved with the good old

52:48.260 --> 52:54.860
guilt trip email, message, or Skype to explain in actuality how disappointed he is with them,

52:54.860 --> 52:59.040
often speaking on behalf of Kai, too, who has been seldom seen since the initiation

52:59.040 --> 53:00.040
of this situation.

53:00.240 --> 53:04.840
It's the sort of condescension that pervades his attitude, the idea that actually, he's

53:04.840 --> 53:09.400
so ashamed that people are coming at him in such a way, sometimes he'll be nice to you,

53:09.400 --> 53:14.320
talk about a connection he thought you had, he'll even place himself under you to grasp

53:14.320 --> 53:15.320
power over you.

53:15.320 --> 53:19.920
It's an attempt to maintain a character that he envisions himself as having, this guy who

53:19.920 --> 53:24.760
is in control of everything, who knows exactly what's going on, still under the impression

53:24.760 --> 53:28.640
that if he can talk to these people in a certain way, he can make them listen.

53:29.640 --> 53:34.560
There are so many responses by Onision at this point that it becomes nauseating, each

53:34.560 --> 53:39.180
with their own failure to actually talk about what's being said and done, and that's because

53:39.180 --> 53:44.100
the evidence is stacked incredibly deep, there is no real way you can respond without attempting

53:44.100 --> 53:48.520
to discredit your accusers, to watch him flail in these responses seems to be some sort of

53:48.520 --> 53:49.520
poetic justice.

53:59.120 --> 54:04.480
What I've learned today, ours get away with their crimes in part due to people who are

54:04.480 --> 54:07.600
too cowardly to report them to the police.

54:07.600 --> 54:11.320
Your husband responds, guess I'm to blame.

54:11.320 --> 54:16.620
Your response, I blame everyone who's ever been violated, not just on the violators,

54:16.620 --> 54:19.720
but those who keep their crimes a secret.

54:19.720 --> 54:21.140
You earned that.

54:21.140 --> 54:25.460
Someone tells you that when people go to a specific location at a specific time of day,

54:25.460 --> 54:29.660
they are always hurt, and you decide to go to that location at the specific time of day

54:29.660 --> 54:35.460
and you get hurt, do you think it would be fair to say you were asking for it?

54:35.460 --> 54:40.880
What about women and men who decided to go home to abusive relationships, relationships

54:40.880 --> 54:46.700
where they are regularly beaten, do you think they're asking for it?

54:46.700 --> 54:51.460
I'm sure there are a thousand scenarios that I'm not considering, but for all the ones

54:51.460 --> 54:54.980
I am, it's pretty undeniable that they are.

54:54.980 --> 55:00.180
When you look back at his previous comments, his strange tweets, his behaviours, Onision's

55:00.180 --> 55:04.700
philosophy does seem to be one of control, but it also seems to be one where he speaks

55:04.700 --> 55:07.020
ill of the people that he is controlling.

55:07.020 --> 55:11.180
As noted, he has regularly spoken about how abuse victims almost share responsibility

55:11.180 --> 55:16.500
for not speaking up, and now people are speaking up, finally doing what he has preached.

55:16.500 --> 55:21.540
I feel if he was a man of his word, he'd have some grudging respect for his fate, but

55:21.540 --> 55:25.820
he doesn't, and that's because he's not what he envisions himself as.

55:25.820 --> 55:30.940
He's a coward, he's a money grabbing coward, in his head he might see himself as some supervillain

55:30.940 --> 55:35.060
who makes people bow to his motives, and for a while he may have done that, but at the

55:35.060 --> 55:40.100
end of it all, he's just a loser who pursues people who lack both physical and mental power.

55:40.100 --> 55:43.620
Now he's putting on this show because he thinks he can create some greater narrative

55:43.620 --> 55:45.260
about cancel culture.

55:45.260 --> 55:49.620
There is little cancel culture here, Onision has continued to instigate in a way that will

55:49.620 --> 55:52.820
provoke a reaction, and then frame it as self-defence.

55:52.820 --> 55:57.340
Only a few weeks ago he filed two civil lawsuits against Chris Hansen and Repzion, the latter

55:57.340 --> 56:01.340
simply for its continuous coverage of Greg's channel and Ms. Diving's.

56:01.340 --> 56:05.260
Chris Hansen turned up at his house, and although you could say it was overkill, it didn't seem

56:05.260 --> 56:06.260
dangerous.

56:06.260 --> 56:17.940
These cases were obviously dismissed.

56:17.940 --> 56:21.420
The strange detail comes about in the fact that Onision appeared to dismiss the case

56:21.420 --> 56:22.420
himself.

56:22.420 --> 56:25.540
Although there are theories circling around this, in another new video Onision confirms

56:25.540 --> 56:29.500
he will be pursuing greater legal action against Repzion, I guess we'll just have to keep an

56:29.500 --> 56:30.500
eye on him.

56:30.500 --> 56:34.100
I'd also like to note that in Kai's statement, he says that Repzion has been harassing them

56:34.100 --> 56:39.300
collectively for over 10 years, which would once again make Kai 15 upon the initiation

56:39.300 --> 56:43.500
of this alleged harassment, which, although probably a deliberate lie to attack Repzion,

56:43.500 --> 56:47.380
is unbelievably bad optics that backfire when you consider them.

56:47.380 --> 56:51.340
Oh, and also Onision sued the wrong Chris Hansen.

56:51.340 --> 56:52.340
Nice one, Greg.

56:52.340 --> 56:56.160
I'd also add that it was funny he decided to claim all his insanity videos won't act

56:56.160 --> 57:00.060
just before he filed the lawsuit, some real coincidence there.

57:00.060 --> 57:03.900
Nonetheless, it's clear that given these examples, he will jump at any opportunity to

57:03.900 --> 57:09.580
turn some perhaps excessive attacks into pure victimhood, and I would urge caution

57:09.580 --> 57:12.940
with that in mind, for many reasons.

57:12.940 --> 57:16.580
Firstly because, as mentioned, that is his narrative, there should only be one goal in

57:16.580 --> 57:20.940
my opinion for his channel, and that should be termination, or at least removal of the

57:20.940 --> 57:23.620
power to upload new content as it is.

57:23.620 --> 57:27.740
That does not need to be achieved by harassing him, or anyone else, that can be done by making

57:27.740 --> 57:31.740
a formal appeal to YouTube, putting serious pressure on them, and illuminating what he

57:31.740 --> 57:32.740
has done.

57:32.740 --> 57:36.660
Secondly, because in spite of his and Kai's actions, there is a family involved.

57:36.660 --> 57:40.280
Given one of his clips has him shouting at kids in the background, many have questioned

57:40.280 --> 57:42.180
his ability to be a parent.

57:42.180 --> 57:45.780
Without greater context, nothing's going to be happening in that regard soon.

57:45.780 --> 57:50.820
Thirdly, and probably most importantly, we do not know how far he's willing to go to

57:50.820 --> 57:52.100
prove his point.

57:52.100 --> 57:55.780
At this stage, it seems like he's trying to conjure up this story, and the moment that

57:55.780 --> 57:59.300
people give that to him, then he could do something terrible.

57:59.300 --> 58:01.500
Don't let him do that, and pin it on you.

58:01.500 --> 58:05.780
People love to troll individuals who are widely hated, it's cathartic, it makes people feel

58:05.780 --> 58:10.180
like they're providing some form of citizen's justice, but it's not conducive.

58:10.180 --> 58:15.820
Don't let him compare himself to Etika, he is not in the same cosmos as him.

58:15.820 --> 58:20.080
His victims have the right narrative, respond to what he says directly, bring attention

58:20.080 --> 58:23.700
to the situation, remove his power.

58:23.700 --> 58:28.340
I don't think Onision has a place on YouTube, from everything public, even the videos he

58:28.340 --> 58:32.620
made public himself, it's clear there is something deeply broken about him.

58:32.620 --> 58:36.900
From the 60 plus videos he made on Eugenia Cooney, to the documenting of suffering and

58:36.900 --> 58:41.820
abuse within his own relationships in an attempt to stir up drama, to unlawfully claiming and

58:41.820 --> 58:45.860
even removing videos that provide critical commentary on him.

58:45.860 --> 58:50.980
It's all ground enough to reconsider his position on the platform, but the most prominent point,

58:50.980 --> 58:54.740
and this is the one that I have stressed in the past, is the fact that as long as he has

58:54.740 --> 58:59.580
the power, and a way to attract people who are willing to validate and defend this behaviour,

58:59.580 --> 59:04.020
which although small is significant enough, there will always be people who unfortunately

59:04.020 --> 59:06.340
allow themselves to become targets.

59:06.340 --> 59:10.700
In the wake of new harassment rules, which in my opinion have gone completely overboard

59:10.700 --> 59:15.740
in the censorship of content, such as Leafy Content Cop, and Yoko Naru's video vigilante,

59:15.740 --> 59:20.380
amongst many others, the fact that YouTube, in spite of the almost overwhelming flood

59:20.380 --> 59:25.420
of complaints and evidence against Onision, and how he has used this platform to obtain

59:25.420 --> 59:30.940
power and use it in this way, the fact that they have the audacity to turn a blind eye

59:30.940 --> 59:32.460
is unbelievable.

59:32.460 --> 59:37.220
YouTube is still his most powerful medium, even if he has a fraction of the fans that

59:37.220 --> 59:38.220
he had in the past.

59:38.220 --> 59:43.100
Don't let him sucker a new victim in, because you want to protect your revenue flow, it's

59:43.100 --> 59:44.100
not worth it.

59:44.100 --> 59:47.820
I don't know what will happen by the time this video is out, if his channel is gone

59:47.820 --> 59:51.940
then so be it, but the argument remains the same for anyone in this position who has used

59:51.940 --> 59:57.380
their power to contact individuals far beneath their age and solicit activities that many

59:57.380 --> 01:00:01.060
would view as morally wrong, whether he's legally culpable or not.

01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:05.660
In fact, the only other time I have seen the channel shut down under predatory circumstances

01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:09.580
was Austin Jones, and I'm convinced that was only because he was literally convicted

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:10.940
of child porn.

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:16.660
However, as said, Onision has a reputation for being strangely meticulous regarding laws,

01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:21.740
now maybe people themselves are saying that Onision and Kai could be legally held to account,

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:26.860
and so I've decided to bring my legal eagle or swan in, John Swan, to have a look at these

01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:31.540
accusations and see if there's any chance of a case being brought against Onision or

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:33.300
Kai in the future.

01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:34.780
Take it away my friend.

01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:38.500
This isn't going to be a very popular segment, and that's because the things I'm about to

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:42.500
present to you are probably not what you want to hear.

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:47.220
This topic has been one of the most stressful, aggravating and tedious topics that I've ever

01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:49.540
had the displeasure of encountering.

01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:52.020
Onision is not a good person.

01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:56.480
In fact, he is most likely a disgusting and repulsive human being who uses his position

01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:00.380
of power to prey upon younger girls that don't know any better.

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:05.460
Not only that, but he is most likely an abhorrent but charismatic bully who abuses his partners

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:07.780
both mentally and physically.

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:10.360
In other words, a piece of shit.

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:12.180
But you already know that.

01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:15.020
So when is he going to jail?

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:16.380
Uh, yeah.

01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:17.380
About that.

01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:21.420
I want to preface this segment by making it clear that I do not support Onision in any

01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:22.980
way, shape or form.

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:26.720
I'm going to be critical of Chris Hansen and the way that he's gone about his investigation

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:30.440
throughout this segment, but being critical of the way an investigation has been carried

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:33.460
out is not the same as supporting Onision.

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:35.860
I just want to clarify something before we start.

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:39.620
People have constantly been framing Onision as a groomer.

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:44.740
Okay, groomer has been a popular response to his tweets, but unlike the UK, Australia

01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:48.580
and many countries in Europe, grooming is not a crime in the US.

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:53.380
It is perfectly acceptable for a 16 year old to move in with a 30 year old, not to have

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:58.260
any sexual relations and to have sex with them on the day after they turn 18.

01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:01.220
It's really bloody creepy, but it's perfectly legal.

01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:05.060
You need something a lot more substantial than that to get a conviction.

01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:09.520
Throughout this segment, I want to put focus on one word in particular, evidence.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:14.960
To convict anyone of any crime, you need a lot of evidence.

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:19.480
Evidence is sometimes hard to come by because it can't just be a person saying what happened.

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:20.600
That's not evidence.

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:21.600
That's a testimony.

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:25.820
And in order for a testimony to be proven accurate, correct and admissible, there needs

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:28.720
to be cold hard proof to back it up.

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:31.040
So where is the proof?

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:36.040
Now if you've been following this situation, your mind likely went straight towards Shiloh,

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:41.120
who allegedly has videos archived originally uploaded on Onision's channel, documenting

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:43.600
Onision's abuse towards her.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:48.080
Any competent criminal defense lawyer would have many things to say about these videos

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.120
being admissible in court.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:53.320
First of all, there's the issue of Onision's content itself.

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:57.360
Much of it is not to be taken seriously and could be classified as satire.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.960
So why would these clips be any different?

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:03.800
At the end of the day, it's just one person's word against another.

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:07.240
That's not to say I don't believe Shiloh, but I'm trying to be fully objective here,

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:11.440
erring on the side of caution, because that will be the lens of the court system looks

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.880
at this from.

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:16.280
Courts generally err on the side of caution when it comes to making decisions, since they

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:20.760
don't want to hand out a wrongful conviction, and I'll try my best to maintain that position

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:21.760
throughout this segment.

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.880
Anyway, back to the videos.

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:28.640
So there's the problem of Onision's backlog mostly consisting of content that is satire,

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:31.500
but then there's also the logical arguments to be made.

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:35.860
If these were legitimate clips of Onision abusing Shiloh, why would he upload them for

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:37.940
millions of people to see?

01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:40.600
It just makes no sense to the outside world.

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:44.940
The courts don't care if Onision is apparently insane, he doesn't have any medical diagnoses,

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:48.800
and a psychological assessment will likely bring back results that he is just a normal

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.460
functioning human being.

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:54.700
However insane Onision might be, I have no doubt in my mind that he is capable of acting

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:59.420
completely sane and more than able to fool any surface level psychological assessment

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:02.180
that might go on when going through the court system.

01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:06.620
So all in all what I'm saying is that these videos will likely not be admissible in court

01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:10.380
due to the nature of them and the content surrounding them, so we'll definitely need

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:14.380
a bit more than this if we are going to convict Onision of anything.

01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:19.300
A better chance to get him on in regards to Shiloh would be under statutory rape.

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:23.540
Shiloh has stated that Onision had sex with her when she was 16.

01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:28.300
According to her, he travelled to her state, Pennsylvania with the age of consent at 16,

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:30.980
he booked a hotel room, and they had sex.

01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:38.460
This is illegal under Title 18 of the U.S. Code, Section 2422, Coercion and Enticement,

01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:43.820
which carries a maximum jail sentence of 10 years or 20 years depending on the crime.

01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:48.320
This sexual relationship is also illegal under Pennsylvania's age of consent laws.

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:52.460
In this state, two people between the age of 16 and 17 can consent to have sex with

01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:56.160
each other, but not to someone aged 18 or older.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:01.640
So if this happened, there are two counts to get him on, but there's just a slight

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.880
issue here.

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:06.460
Onision said it didn't happen.

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:08.540
So how do you prove it did?

01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:12.560
CCTV footage of the supposed hotel would be long overwritten by now.

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:16.560
You could show evidence in the form of text messages that Onision was arranging for sex

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:19.960
at a hotel, but they would have to be able to be verified.

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:22.200
Does Shiloh even still have the phone?

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:25.800
If she doesn't, most phone companies wouldn't keep her back up, and even if they did, would

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:29.440
probably not comply with the FBI as Apple has done in the past.

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:34.060
Screenshots are not enough, given how easy it is to fake messages in Photoshop nowadays.

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:37.440
You can even hack into phones to make a text say whatever you want to say.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:39.940
With Android, it's extraordinarily easy.

01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:42.440
With Apple, it's a bit harder, but not impossible.

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:46.040
If both the recipients were using iPhone, they would automatically be using iMessage,

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:50.380
which is encrypted on both ends, meaning that not even Apple can read the messages.

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:54.720
The same goes for WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, and Kik claims they delete messages as soon

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:58.600
as they're sent, so subpoenas of these apps is not an option.

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:02.400
I'm not sure what phone Shiloh had at the time, but any criminal defense lawyer would

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:05.320
have a field day with all these discrepancies.

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:08.160
I could go on more, but I'm not going to bore you with the details.

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:11.560
At the end of the day, it's Onision's word against Shiloh's.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:16.040
The fact that Shiloh has a history of mental illness probably doesn't help her case either.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:19.460
Any criminal defense lawyer would argue that if Shiloh is not in the best of state when

01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:23.580
talking with Onision, that her evidence and statements should hold much less weight in

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:27.220
court or even that her statements should not be heard at all.

01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:31.500
Again, I'm sorry if I'm being cynical, but I'm erring on the side of caution here.

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:35.420
You really need something super duper daring to get a jury to achieve a unanimous verdict

01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:36.420
in court.

01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:40.060
So I'm just trying to put all these accounts under scrutiny.

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:45.820
A lot of Chris Hansen's investigation had more to do with Kai than it did with Onision.

01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:50.260
Sarah's argument in relation to Onision had to do with him grooming her, which isn't illegal

01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:51.820
as I stated before.

01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:55.300
I've seen the argument of power of attorney thrown around a lot.

01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:59.280
That is, Onision couldn't have sexual relations with Sarah, even though she was within the

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:02.820
age of consent at the time because he provided for her.

01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:07.540
He put the food on the table and in many respects, he was her legal guardian of sorts.

01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:12.060
Now the issue with this argument is the power of attorney stops becoming a valid point when

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:13.780
you turn 18.

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:16.340
When you're 18, you're an adult and you can make your own decisions.

01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:21.140
For example, a teacher is said to have power of attorney over a student in school.

01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:25.380
In many states, it is illegal for someone who has power of attorney to have sexual relations

01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:30.100
with someone who is under the age of 18, even though both parties may be within the age

01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:31.100
of consent.

01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:35.860
But when you turn 18, you can have sex with anyone you like, including teachers at your

01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:36.860
school.

01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:37.860
Is it creepy?

01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:38.860
Yes.

01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:39.860
Will that teacher lose their license?

01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:40.860
Yes.

01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:41.860
But is it illegal?

01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:44.460
Not in criminal court, maybe in civil court under malpractice, but that doesn't apply

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:45.460
here.

01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:48.780
So realistically, what do we have left?

01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:52.780
At the moment, the arguments against Kai are looking a whole lot more convincing than

01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:55.020
the arguments against Onision.

01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:58.860
There have been accusations of child pornography specifically to do with Sarah that have been

01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:00.660
thrown out against Kai.

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:05.380
Sarah allegedly had a laptop and phone originally belonging to Kai that had illegal pornography

01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:08.480
on it that was supposed to be sent to the FBI.

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:13.260
Chris Hansen told her to send it to this guy, Vincent Nicotra, who's a scam artist and professional

01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:16.020
cry baby under Chris Hansen's name.

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:20.100
Vincent had stated that Chris Hansen told him to await further instructions, but further

01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:21.980
instructions never came.

01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:25.600
It was just sitting in this guy's New York apartment for months.

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:29.420
Any criminal defense lawyer would have a field day saying that this evidence should not be

01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:31.800
admissible for obvious reasons.

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:36.700
The amount to which this investigation has been absolutely botched is insane to me.

01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:38.220
Chris Hansen is not the police.

01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:41.460
Hell, Chris Hansen isn't even an investigator.

01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:43.260
He's just an interviewer.

01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:47.360
While his TV show is running, Hansen never did any of the behind the scenes work himself.

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:49.720
He merely interviewed the predators.

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:52.980
He had a whole team of professionals helping him.

01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:56.900
And now here's this guy, which he fired and a lawyer accused of sexual assault in the

01:08:56.900 --> 01:09:00.180
Michigan Supreme Court and also named in the center of a fraud scheme.

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:02.100
Good choice of people there, Chris.

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:05.020
Hansen has put a false sense of hope into these girls.

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:10.260
He set himself up to be the hero in this big story, the big man who is going to take Onision

01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:12.480
down once and for all.

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:15.960
But I just don't think this is the case.

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:17.320
And neither does Sarah.

01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:49.320
Because putting my faith in them to do it was not the correct move, obviously.

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:52.960
What these ladies did coming out into the public eye under all this scrutiny in the

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:57.740
world in front of millions of people must have taken some intense balls.

01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:02.160
And they're all extremely strong for having come out with their stories against Onision.

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:07.640
I support the victims 100%, but that doesn't mean I can cherry pick the truth and tell

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.280
you what you want to hear.

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:13.040
I'm not going to do what Chris Hansen has done for months now and put a false sense

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:16.680
of hope into anyone who might have been affected by Onision.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:21.040
Because what he's done may be disgusting, repulsive and creepy, but it's just legal

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:24.080
enough to where he'll probably get away with it.

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:28.480
Sarah has said that she's looking at bringing civil action against Onision, which I think

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:31.680
has a much better chance of getting some sort of conviction.

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:33.320
But he won't be jailed for this.

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.920
He'll have to pay damages.

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:38.760
Still better than nothing, but if this happens, he won't be going to jail.

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:42.520
Just before I end off today, I want to present to you one more aspect surrounding criminal

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:45.260
trial that you might not be aware of.

01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:49.520
In order to have a successful trial, a jury needs to be unbiased according to the Sixth

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:50.520
Amendment.

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:54.800
There have been situations where a case has been thrown out completely due to a jury not

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:59.740
being able to be unbiased, perhaps in the case of significant media attention.

01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:02.840
We live in a very interesting time with online media.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:07.800
In the past, restrictions have been put on newspapers and TV in certain situations to

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:10.480
prevent a jury from being biased.

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:14.680
Just recently in Australia, newspapers and TV were banned from reporting on the conviction

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:18.120
of Cardinal Pell, as the case was still ongoing.

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:21.720
This has happened in the US before, and it's not out of the question that it might happen

01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:24.600
with Onision if he does go to trial.

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:28.380
But the internet is not able to be controlled so easily.

01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:32.380
With the internet becoming the new place where people are consuming their news and entertainment,

01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:36.160
the dangers of influencing a jury begin to increase.

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:40.240
This is certainly a bit of a stretch, but it's important to consider that while reporting

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:45.640
on Onision's actions may assist in bringing his actions to light, it may also hinder civil

01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:49.880
processes, and that is something we all have to keep in mind going forward.

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:11.360
I owe it to you, but I have some unfinished business here, so I suggest we round this up.

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:24.040
As noted, there is no guarantee that there will be legal ramifications facing Onision.

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:28.300
There may be more evidence, and that may alter the likelihood of any legal cases, but certain

01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:32.180
individuals saying that others should be calling the police rather than making these videos

01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:35.440
on it seem to have a bizarre grasp on the situation.

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:39.320
A lot of what Onision's been accused of doing isn't a black and white legal question.

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:43.340
A lot of the points regarding grooming aren't things that he's necessarily going to be convicted

01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:48.500
of, and that's the way the law operates, on the steepest burden of proof, rightfully so must I add.

01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:52.520
I will also add that when dealing with criminal evidence, the first thing you should do is

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:56.920
go to the police, but I will clarify it, I don't think a lot of what we're dealing with

01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:01.000
today makes him a criminal, I just think they make him an unequivocally terrible person

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.800
who has grossly abused his power.

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:07.560
This is not exempting the possibility that actually legally incriminating evidence has been withheld

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:12.600
from the public eye, which would be completely justified, but he's a man who clearly has tried to

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:18.520
legally cover his backside, and we have to prepare for the possibility that he remains a free man.

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:23.520
Being a bad person doesn't mean being a criminal, but just because you're not a criminal doesn't mean

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:28.400
that you should have a platform, especially if you exploit the power in a way that a lot of the evidence

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:32.960
suggests that Onision has. Warning people who may fall for his mental tricks, and cautioning those who

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:38.440
may be romantically vulnerable to his manipulation is not a legal thing, you can't take out restraining

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:44.280
orders on behalf of all 16 year olds, you just gotta make your voice loud and clear, and hope they hear it.

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:49.400
Onision will continue to pull out all the stops to make sure he's not liable, as said, the gradual

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:54.520
isolation of his content is a step in that direction, but he also recently wiped his Twitter completely,

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:59.600
and he's continued to delete certain videos off his channel, often ones that on the surface, I couldn't really

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:04.520
see the purpose behind, but there may be something deeper within them. A lot of them have been archived

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:09.320
regardless, so there's not really a great amount of good in removing them at this point, though maybe he's

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:14.720
hoping investigating authorities will have a bit of a boomer approach to social media. Of course, it's not just

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:20.200
the feeds and the videos that make him liable, it's people like Kai as well, whose allegations definitely extend

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:25.280
into the criminal question, and like the possibly incriminating tweets and videos, Onision appears to have

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:30.800
deleted Kai. In fact, a police report was filed on the 22nd of November by a concerned neighbour who said

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.720
they hadn't seen Kai in a while.

01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:45.080
Another report posted on November the 9th concerned a confrontation in which physical contact occurred,

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:47.560
which has led to some more conspiracy theories.

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:49.480
Communications, how may I help you?

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:53.320
Hello, is this the Gig Harbor non-emergency line?

01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:55.880
Yep, we dispatched for them, how can I help you?

01:14:55.880 --> 01:15:02.840
Hey, I wasn't sure if this was an emergency or not, but I would like to report something that might be an issue,

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:07.600
it looks like some sort of argument going down at a house.

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.360
Is this going on inside or outside?

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:18.880
I saw some people coming in and out of the house, looks like some sort of maybe 30s white male and a short-haired

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:25.720
sort of androgynous looking female, I'm not sure, and I'm not sure how it looks like a pretty heated argument

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:28.920
or whatever was going on, but I wasn't sure that it was emergency level.

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:34.640
Now, I doubt anything's actually happened, Kai, it's just very likely that Greg's hiding him from the public spotlight,

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:39.000
because the best way to deal with legal investigations is to give them as little as possible,

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:44.280
and that includes people as well, other than the involvement in the legal complaint against Repzion and Chris Hansen,

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:46.360
there hasn't been much activity from Kai.

01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:52.120
Towards the end of December, there was a post on his Patreon, assumedly from him, stating that he would be taking a hiatus.

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:56.840
Onision is paranoid, and that shows, in a report that was recently made publicly available,

01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:01.400
there was an accident involving his daughter, where she fell from the window of our house and cracked her skull open.

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:06.760
Alright, so these things happen, and honestly, it is really sad, but what was telling were the additional details,

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:12.760
including the information that while waiting for the paramedics to arrive, Greg decided to film the aftermath of the accident.

01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:18.600
Now, if that raises your eyebrows, then understandable, as it raised the eyebrows of the police officers investigating as well.

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:21.320
What was his justification for this? Well, two reasons.

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:26.600
The first one, which I personally don't find very convincing, is that he wanted to record the landscape to provide information

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:30.920
for medical professionals so that they knew about the fall, but I doubt that.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:34.960
What I personally find more plausible is the second explanation, where Greg states,

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:42.080
concern that he's afraid people might implicate him, referring to a situation when someone allegedly framed him for their suicide attempt.

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:48.440
Honestly, in spite of the lack of sense this argument makes, I find it more likely that he probably viewed it from that perspective

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:55.080
at the time he was worried that someone would blame him, given the nature of the internet currently, everyone does indeed hate him.

01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:59.800
I must clarify that just by filming the aftermath does not mean that you couldn't have committed a crime,

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:03.800
although I personally don't believe he did, it seems slightly irresponsible that if the parents acknowledge

01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:11.840
the child is prone to climbing a lot of things, they'd allow that setup to take place, though I digress, I do not know enough about that specific situation.

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:18.640
I must also observe how inappropriate it was that at the time he was due in the hospital, he was tweeting out various sexual content,

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:25.680
but maybe that was a paranoid reaction too, we all know that he's been recently trying to make his accounts so explicitly 18+,

01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:31.800
maybe so he couldn't be accused of roping fans in with child oriented content before ambushing them with the adult stuff.

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:38.360
Perhaps with all these legal changes right now, he was worried about that too, though I personally think it's all a bit too late for that.

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:47.160
I'd also like to say that this is a very ill thought out tweet a few days after this incident, I'm not sure that's the sort of imagery you should be invoking, Gregory.

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:55.560
So with this paranoia, and with his bizarre reactions that it seems to provoke, he has had one more outlook that I think I'd debunk before reaching my conclusion,

01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:04.040
and that is the hashtag satire. With his recent pinned comment, and the tags, it seems he might try and dismiss certain actions as a joke in the future,

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:09.200
and although there are certain things that you could explain in a farcical light, such as maybe his twitter comments,

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:17.720
a lot of evidence the stuff he has done to other people can't be explained as easily, because he presented a serious environment for many of the people

01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:23.160
who are accusing him today, and the trauma that they felt is very real, that is beyond comedy.

01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:30.360
I feel that he may be trying to shield himself from liability, and perhaps in the instance of legal prosecution, attempt to mitigate the sentence,

01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:37.480
because obviously the sentence can depend on a lot of conditions, and there's a lot of minor things here that obviously wouldn't be incriminating on their own,

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:41.160
but when paired with a criminal conviction could harm a person's case.

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:46.920
Recently there has been this wave of narratives, I think partly accountable to the justified exhaustion of people talking about Onision,

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:53.080
and the overstepping of boundaries by certain individuals. They seem to be adapting greats, where's the proof line of reasoning?

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:59.000
The first logical fallacy in this argument is that I still don't know what claims they're responding to generally when they say that.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:09.320
Where is the proof? There's shit that obviously makes Onision look bad, treating people horrible, but where is the...

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:16.360
I mean, a picture or something of Onision making out with one of these girls when they're underage, like where is the proof?

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:18.600
I mean, it's more...

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:26.840
Keemstar obviously clarifies here, for example, that it's underage making out, but for me that was such a small proportion of the allegations with so much more to consider.

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:31.320
If you want proof that Greg's manipulative to the point of false suicide threats, then there's proof.

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:36.040
If you want proof that Greg has used his platform to publicly shame and abuse people, then there's proof.

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:41.080
If you want proof that Greg hid a minor from the public eye and their own parents to then marry them, then there's proof.

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:47.000
If you want proof that after continuously reaching out to a person who is clearly not interested in them, Greg publicly stated on a video,

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.640
still up on his channel, that he intended to wait until they were 18 to get with them, then there's proof.

01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:58.920
That Greg is abusing the Content ID system to copyright claim critical videos off him, something that I thought everyone cared about, then there's proof.

01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:07.320
If you want proof that Greg uploaded over 60 videos on a mentally vulnerable anorexic person, as well as making claims they were accountable for the deaths of others, then there's proof.

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:16.920
If you want proof that Greg roped in significantly younger people for weird three-way dynamics, uploading it onto his channel, or using its influence to coerce and pressure certain outcomes, then there's proof.

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:22.280
If you want proof that Greg publicly posted people's contact details, then heaven help me, there is proof.

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:29.320
If you want proof that Onision lied while filing court order, there is proof. I could go on, and that's not even getting to Kai.

01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:36.280
You can interpret and even challenge the proof if you personally question its validity, but denying the existence of proof is just lazy.

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:40.840
There's not some big twist here. As said, there's obviously certain claims that are harder to prove.

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:48.680
When I went over the specific underage making out allegation, I stated that it could not be proven. You can 100% make your own judgement on that.

01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:59.400
I'm not sure that claims like pedophilia are true, and it's okay to have reservations about the case, but a lot of what we've discussed is hard to challenge, especially when a lot of it was on Onision's own channel.

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:05.720
And that is the second logical fallacy, to believe that the existence of an angry mob somehow implies that a person is innocent.

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:13.400
Mobs that lose sense of reasoning and justice are not good, for sure, and we've discussed that before, and people can see the problems with it.

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:20.360
But let's be real here, many commentators will be foaming at the mouth for Onision's copyright abuse alone if he was any other creator.

01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:27.000
Criticise who you need to, but criticism of one side does not exonerate the other. Don't make that mistake.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:34.440
As said, I think it's tentative whether Onision will actually see legal consequences for his actions, but he's not some calculated mastermind.

01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:42.200
He clearly doesn't know his fate either, and he's doing everything to make sure, because he knows that nothing will stop him harder than the long arm of the law.

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:47.080
But as we know, it might not stop him. So how can we, and what is there left to say?

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:56.600
Onision, acting like I'm better than a lot of people when many of those people are more caring, sociable, and selfless than I am, or may ever be.

01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:05.400
As said, I've only been able to cover so much regarding this interesting specimen, and there's still a lot deeper you could go.

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:13.080
But ultimately, what I want to do today was at least create a comprehensive case for why Onision's future on the platform of YouTube should be questioned.

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:23.160
Whether Onision plays within the bounds of legality, and even the YouTube rules, which I would question, there's a result that his behaviour yields which shows the consequences of his actions.

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:35.000
That should not be ignored. Obviously, the ultimate goal for many people will be to have his YouTube channels removed, and I understand that given how he has leveraged that clout to cause so much of this drama and suffering.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:41.960
However, you also want to keep in mind the fact that regardless of what happens, even if you remove his YouTube, he will continue to persist.

01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:48.360
All this drama has shown is that attempting to push him down brings him back more aggressively, in some form or another.

01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:53.720
He'll move to a different platform, he'll change the structures in place to support him, he wants to adapt.

01:22:53.720 --> 01:23:00.280
Plenty of people know how to loophole the rules, it's extremely important to be conscious of that, and the consequences that it may yield.

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:08.120
People just like DaddyOFive. Now, DaddyOFive was an abusive man-child with a victim complex, and he should have definitely had his child terminated.

01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:16.280
However, I don't think he ever mobilised his platform to the degree that Onision does, and that means that even if Onision loses his YouTube channel,

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:22.200
there's no guarantee that he loses all the modes of communication with the audience that many people are concerned about.

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:27.640
Even now, he's clearly demonstrating modes to change in a way that protects his source of income.

01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:35.800
That's the problem in many ways, putting someone out of sight doesn't mean they lose their power, sometimes it just isolates them with their victims even more,

01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:41.960
so if you really consider Onision a threat, it never stops at him being held to account on one platform.

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:49.800
You have to be actively conscious about all platforms, I think that's the problem for many people, how does one stay focused on Onision's ventures?

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:58.280
After this video, there is a strong chance that I won't make another, and in many ways, you could say by doing that, I'm not exactly following up and keeping tabs on him.

01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:06.760
I hope there will be people who do keep tabs on him, but at the same time, I wouldn't necessarily expect people to, and eventually, every topic dies out.

01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:16.520
But Onision doesn't stop being Onision, Onision never stops being Onision, the only thing that may stop him is a criminal conviction, and that is not guaranteed to happen.

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:23.960
Obviously, I keep the option open, but I think you have to prepare for the worst case scenario, you have to be ready for Onision to wriggle his way out of this,

01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:27.960
because that's what he is known to do, and that's what he will do time and time again.

01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:36.120
I don't like Onision, I don't think he's a good person, I don't think he's an honest person, I feel that he's caused a lot of pain and dealt a lot of abuse to people who loved him,

01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:43.160
particularly that of the psychological nature. Many of those people looked to him, and in the end, they went to him, with some going through Kai.

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:50.200
Onision was a creator with a lot of power, and that allowed him to retain a fan base in spite of the numerous controversies.

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:57.000
This time round, he was not so fortunate, and many of his worst behaviours were placed on display for the world to judge,

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:03.800
behaviours that now seeing them in the context of his YouTube channel shows his calculated and manipulative nature.

01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:09.400
A significant proportion of the evidence is hard to see in any other context that may change people's minds,

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:14.120
and understandably, this has led many to call on YouTube to take full retributive actions.

01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:18.440
I don't think Onision should be allowed to upload the content that he is currently on his channel,

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:26.520
and even if you think that he should have a channel, it's hard to see how these new videos are going to help him or anyone else in any capacity,

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:31.640
other than a monetary one. Of course, we have a strong suspicion that this is all an elaborate ploy,

01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:37.000
which would explain a fair bit, to be honest. Although there have been minor victories that clearly irritate him,

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:43.880
such as the removal of his Patreon, overall, I still think he has other plans, and I don't think he'll be giving them up easily.

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:47.480
What about the future of his channel? Well, providing the channel does have a future,

01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:56.520
he'll probably round out this rather bizarre series of content with a more serious video that will try and exemplify the meltdown videos as a result of personal persecution,

01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:01.320
or maybe he'll go in a more insane direction until people stop providing the views they draw right now.

01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:12.520
I don't like the question, how do I become a vegetarian, because it's like, it's kind of like, how do I, how do I lose weight, or how do I stop smoking,

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:20.600
how do I stop drinking, how do I stop beating my wife, or driving under the influence of drugs or something.

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:28.520
You know, it's just, it's really, really simple. Self-control. Why can't you? Why can't you just stop eating meat?

01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:33.960
I'm telling you that you are an intelligent human being, and that you are capable of just stopping.

01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:41.400
One of the philosophical dichotomies that Onision has preached in many of his videos is the idea of survival versus greed.

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:48.760
He believes the latter, greed, is undesirable, but Onision himself is merely greed masquerading as survival.

01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:57.160
He takes what he can get, but he can get a lot more than most, and if you don't stop him, he'll blame you, and if you do stop him, he'll blame you.

01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:05.160
There is no easy way around the Onision conundrum, at the end of the day, we can best create a discourse on this behaviour and bring attention to it,

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:13.160
not just for the sake of the people who may be a target, but for ourselves. Do what you think is right, have pure motivations.

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:19.720
Onision is a man of many motivations, but none of which are remotely beneficial for the general YouTube aura.

01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:26.600
Some of his motivations are sexual, some of them are monetary, but they all intertwine into the idea of power that he wishes to retain,

01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:34.920
and until one deprives him of that power, he has a complacency and determination that means I do worry about anyone else who may fall under his grasp,

01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:42.120
which, as shown throughout this series, is still possible. I don't think the results of that power are positive for those around him,

01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:47.800
either they end up being scarred, or they end up like Kai, whose behaviour has been equally wretched.

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:55.560
There's no way to succinctly sum up everything I've spoken about in the last few videos, but I hope you keep it all in mind when arbitrating your opinion,

01:27:55.560 --> 01:28:02.360
and hopefully come to an educated conclusion. May you watch some other videos too, I might. I won't hold it against you.

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:08.360
For now though, the best I can personally hope is that no one suffers on Onision's hands again in that way,

01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:12.360
and we can all take a few lessons forward from this situation.

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:18.120
Life. It's a thing that happens to pretty much everyone in some capacity.

01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:23.400
From the day that life begins to the day it ends, it encompasses an experience unique to that individual.

01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:30.680
How that individual may interpret their own life is also something unique, but one really must wonder how Onision views his life,

01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:36.360
when he treats his reputation a sparing second to the power that he's always wished to acquire.

01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:40.040
In a video where he talks about his ascent to suicide, he says this.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:51.560
On that day I made a decision.

01:28:52.520 --> 01:29:00.520
I was either going to kill myself there, or I was going to give myself some good reasons to live on.

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:04.520
In my mind I pulled that trigger.

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:10.520
In my mind, the moment that gun was to my head, I stopped being afraid.

01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:16.520
I stopped caring.

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:22.520
I've changed as a person since that day.

01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:32.520
Because now I feel like no matter what happens to me, I made it way further than I should have.

01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:36.520
I am just brain splattered on a wall.

01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:44.520
What you are looking at is a talking suicide.

01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:51.000
So when you guys call me brave, remember you're just talking to a ghost.

01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:57.240
It might just be another disposable video where he tends to rope in people with false death,

01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:01.720
but whether the story behind it is true, the philosophy leads me to a question.

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:06.840
When someone lacks the grasp of one's own life or one's own purpose,

01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:10.760
where do they draw the boundaries of how they treat other people's lives?

01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:14.440
Onision has never played the boundaries like anyone else,

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:19.320
never with the regard for those around him that he gives and expects himself.

01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:23.800
There is little debate over a lot of what he's done, and how he's regularly failed to justify

01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:29.240
those actions, but the one question I do ponder is how aware of this behaviour he is,

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:33.160
whether he does perceive himself as the victim of some delirious witch hunt,

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:36.840
or if he knows of his deeply flawed attitude and approach.

01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:41.480
I'm not entirely sure, but his moments of clarity do seem to be telling sometimes.

01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:47.560
Throughout this video, I've shown clips from a 2014 upload called Who I Really Am

01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:52.680
on his Onision channel, a video whose candid accuracy I felt couldn't be ignored,

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:57.000
and I'll leave you and Onision with one more quote from that.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.400
Onision- I could try to pretend things are different, but that would mean lying.

01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:04.600
If the truth is your enemy, then your real enemy is yourself.

01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:05.640
Thank you.

01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:37.480
I want to give a big shout out to my Patreons.

01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:41.000
My $10 Patreons are all up on screen right now.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.640
They do fantastic work, thank you.

01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:50.040
I need to give a big shout out to my $50 Patreons, Somehullabaloo, Nico Deschamps, and Caroline,

01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:54.440
and a very special thanks to my $100 Patreons, Brandon and Stanton.

01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:56.120
Thank you guys so much, really.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:57.560
Thank you.

01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:01.800

01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:11.880
I don't really have too much else to add, I think I might go and fall into an eternal sleep.

01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:17.000
So until then, I'm TheRightOpinion, and I will see you in the next one.
