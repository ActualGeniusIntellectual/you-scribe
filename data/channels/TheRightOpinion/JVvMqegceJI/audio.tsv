0	5580	Two brothers come up to me, aged 7 and 8, with an unexplained, aggressive look in their eye.
5580	14120	And the younger one pushes me to the ground, kicks me in the stomach, and just says,
14120	15120	GAY.
15120	25460	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
25460	29960	And as I begin to record this lovely voiceover, we are 24 days into Pride Month,
29960	35160	the delightful time of the year where LGBT individuals have a chance to celebrate their identity.
35160	38760	Now, by the time this video is released, it will probably be mid-July earliest.
38760	43260	Anything before that will probably be a miracle, and I'll have to find a way to celebrate.
43260	48460	But given my track record of how to celebrate, I might open myself up to suggestions.
48460	52660	But yes, it's Pride Month, and I assume most of you guys have the memo for what happens.
52660	61160	Now, the community has a very significant online presence, and it's perfectly natural that many people
61160	66660	may take the hopefully supportive atmosphere to talk about their experiences, or even come out themselves.
66660	72160	YouTube, in spite of its rocky relationship with the LGBT community for many justified reasons,
72160	78660	provided one of the greatest, most personal mediums for creators to have unique moments that would not be captured on the television,
78660	81860	making the individual the direct owner of their creation.
81860	86560	Managing to create content more personal, and with personal content comes personal problems.
86560	89360	One of those prevailing problems was sexuality.
89360	92560	The internet is a hotbed for social outcasts for many reasons,
92560	99560	and YouTube was a platform for those to converge in a place where they didn't need the socially accepted qualifications to go places.
99560	105560	This led to a real platform for the LGBT community, with one of the real staples being coming out videos.
105560	108160	Coming out videos are pretty self-explanatory.
108160	114160	They involve one individual coming out as LGBTQ to friends, family, or even you, the audience.
114160	119160	It was a meaningful experience for both creators, who may have felt isolated in their moment of vulnerability,
119160	124160	and audiences who may be looking for that guidance on how to traverse these scenarios themselves.
124160	126660	YouTube's importance is undeniable.
126660	131660	However, it's not every day a highly popular, reputable public figure decides not just to come out,
131660	137660	but to come out in a way that deals with it in an incredibly introspective and detailed fashion with multiple social statements.
137660	141660	However, the individual that I have designed to cover today has done just that.
141660	146160	The individual is Daniel Howell, also known from the YouTube duo Dan and Phil.
146160	148660	Howell is a bonafide YouTube unit.
148660	157160	He has been on the platform since 2009, and really does represent the wholesome online come up that many people like to visualize regarding the website.
157160	162660	His style definitely represented the syndicate of sketch YouTubers that were sprouting from the fertile earth at that point.
162660	167660	But make no mistake, Howell was his own creator and definitely represented the Brits well on that side,
167660	171660	capturing the irony-tainted cynicism that is signature to much of our humor.
171660	174160	He's also content that has aged incredibly well.
174160	178160	In this video, he basically predicts or recognizes stan culture.
178160	186660	And of course you have to follow them on Twitter, but it is important that you at reply everything that they say within the first 12 seconds of them posting a tweet,
186660	191660	because otherwise you're just gonna be lost in the crowd, so you need to be right on the mark,
191660	195660	just replying to absolutely everything they ever say.
195660	200160	And at this point, it is important to remember that you do have to be interesting.
200160	204160	If you're boring, then they just won't care who you are.
204160	211160	So, you know, read their MySpace interests, watch their Tumblr posts, and you know, write down a list of what you think they're interested in,
211160	214160	so you can at least pretend you have similar interests.
214160	219660	Nonetheless, in spite of the very idiosyncratically British tone, this received appreciation from across the globe,
219660	222660	and his channel proceeded to gain a strong amount of traction.
222660	229160	He continued to work with his compadre, Phil Lester of AmazingPhil, and created some very entertaining sketch content
229160	234160	that continued to thrive for a good few years, increasing production values, furthering the creative vision,
234160	242660	working on new channels such as their epic gaming ventures, and moving even beyond YouTube, most notably to their show on BBC Radio 1.
242660	247160	The fact that at a time where YouTube still wasn't quite at its level of cultural magnitude,
247160	253160	a pair of British lads could use that content to gain a spot, and arguably the most iconic British radio station,
253160	258160	should be a real testament to how significant they were in the landscape of YouTube.
258160	263660	However, when you have all that fame dropped in your lap, you sometimes find it difficult to express who you really are.
263660	270660	Content will always be reflective of an individual to an extent, but at the same time, it's not going to tell you who the person behind the camera is,
270660	274660	and people start to theorise, for various reasons that we'll break down in a bit.
275660	282660	Dan even entertained a purposefully bizarre fanfiction, which in hindsight I think was meant to be a bait and a switch
282660	288660	for those who wanted to find out more about him and Phil's relationship, perhaps even taking a shot at those same theorists.
288660	294660	Dan had no interest in going. His friendship with Phil was personal to him and not something he wanted to share with family and friends
294660	297160	who would mean well but insult with every word of comfort.
297160	303660	I always received the impression that many of Dan's videos were just meant to be ironic takedowns masqueraded in fan popular content,
303660	310660	and I'm kind of there for it. Nonetheless, the questions remained and persisted, and at a point, Dan just kind of went quiet on the content front.
310660	316660	Now, unlike Phil, he was not necessarily known for his incredibly regular uploads, and when you get this deep into your career,
316660	323660	sometimes it's therapeutic to take a break, and it wasn't like he fell off the face of the Earth, so no one was really ready for what he was about to drop.
323660	328660	What dropped was a video in which Dan came out. However, it was more than that.
328660	335660	Throughout the video, Dan revisits his past and the history, the experiences that shaped him, how these things had grown to interact with him
335660	341660	as he had progressed with his career and developed as a public figure, and how they had continued to affect him for better and for worse.
341660	347660	These sort of expectations people had placed onto him, and how they had ultimately led up to this moment.
347660	355660	Hello internet. However, it's a bit more than that. We're going to be going into a bit of a deeper philosophical dive today,
355660	362660	and trying to break down the various aspects of coming out videos, their difficulty, their challenge, and sometimes their weaknesses,
362660	368660	but we'll also be going into why they're important, why they matter, and why, with respect to all of these conditions and factors,
368660	375660	I feel that Dan Howell really did something else with a type of video that is often overlooked in the cultural impact they could have.
375660	381660	I'm going to be showing some clips to try and capture the energy of his video, but if you want it done justice, go and watch the whole thing.
382660	385660	So, without further ado, I suggest we get into it.
387660	393660	In the list of things that identify a person, one of the most important for other people to know is their sexuality.
393660	402660	For if sex is the primal force propelling all of these humans forward by their hips, they have to know, are we gonna fuck?
402660	406660	So the first question I should put to you is, why come out?
406660	412660	Now I don't mean generally here, I mean in the fact that you would make a video with regards to coming out to your audience.
412660	418660	I mean on principle, it's a fairly simple answer, at least it used to be, that you want people to be aware,
418660	422660	but as a creator you immediately have to face some nuances that reflect your channel.
422660	426660	Who do you want to be aware? What sort of awareness are you raising?
426660	430660	The easiest solution is to have people aware when they are introduced to the brand.
430660	434660	If they want, they can look up a creator and find out their sexuality,
434660	437660	and that forgets one of the main purposes why someone comes online,
437660	441660	particularly if they see YouTube as an escape from the troublesome real world.
441660	445660	You immediately hit a fairly tough catch-22 as a small YouTuber.
445660	450660	In Dan's instance, he was a face cam YouTuber, so anyone who knew him could immediately identify him,
450660	455660	and that could lead to more real life problems, and without having an online life that's remotely sustainable,
455660	457660	that would be dangerous on his behalf.
457660	461660	Now although in his coming out video he makes it clear that there were people who didn't know,
461660	467660	he also shows that the animosity these people reacted with typically deterred him from being public about his sexuality.
467660	473660	I was six years old, running around the playground, pretending to be Sonic the Hedgehog or something,
473660	478660	when two brothers come up to me, aged seven and eight, with an unexplained aggressive look in their eye,
478660	483660	and the younger one pushes me to the ground, kicks me in the stomach, and just says,
483660	486660	Gay.
486660	490660	This was the first time I ever heard that word.
490660	495660	Well, I don't know what the heck gay means, but apparently it means people kick you on the floor, so that ain't good.
495660	499660	This one little shit who I won't name was one of the school bullies, and he loved the word gay.
499660	502660	He had it in for me, and I have no idea why.
502660	505660	You know me, Mr. Winnie the Pooh meets Slender Man.
505660	508660	Well, when I was ten, just Winnie the Pooh.
508660	513660	I didn't do nothing to no one ever, and yet this guy used my pacifism as a punching bag,
513660	518660	where any group situation was an excuse to single me out, call me gay for some reason,
518660	521660	and then make everyone else exclude me because they were scared of him.
521660	528660	So for a year, I literally had no friends, and this is when the bullying at school really stepped its pussy up.
528660	534660	The things people used to say offhand to me in a corridor were now said loudly in classrooms, where everybody would laugh.
534660	539660	People used to sing songs about me being gay on the bus, while my fellow nerds sat around me,
539660	542660	just stared awkwardly out of the window, not wanting to get involved.
542660	546660	People shouted things out during GCSE exams in front of the whole school,
546660	549660	and the low-key pushing became punches.
549660	552660	People used to wait for me after school just to throw things at me,
552660	558660	once a guy put his hand around my throat and pushed my head against a coat peg in the locker room while everyone was watching,
558660	560660	and just slapped me for five minutes.
560660	567660	Therefore, when creating his original content, it would have been a risky move to also have a sexuality public due to the real-life implications.
567660	572660	In society as it is, people work from the assumption that an individual is straight,
572660	577660	and therefore when someone is not straight and keeps themselves from the audience for the sake of self-protection,
577660	580660	if they do manage to expand their channel and grow out their content,
580660	584660	when they feel the shackles of approval from certain social figures alleviate,
584660	587660	it feels like given people's assumption of heterosexuality,
587660	592660	there is this burden, that feeling that you're not being as open with your audience as you could be.
592660	602660	Here I am, age 27, and my sexual preference is seemingly still a vague, debatable, confusing, impenetrable mystery.
602660	605660	Equally, once you've established a clear relationship with your audience,
605660	609660	you become hesitant to alter it by releasing a coming out video,
609660	613660	because you don't know if your brand is ready to take on a message like that.
613660	617660	There's no shame in not coming out to your audience, remember that.
617660	620660	Sometimes it can even be just based on technicality.
620660	624660	There's an amount of videos that I've wanted to sit down and make just personal and talking to the camera,
624660	628660	yet I've always felt restraint when trying to make any video because honestly,
628660	631660	I don't think it'd fit well within what I normally do.
631660	635660	It's a difficult leap to make for multiple reasons that we'll indulge in, in a bit.
635660	638660	So I'm only telling a few people on the internet right now,
638660	644660	it's not like one day I'm gonna get so many followers that random strangers in my family might see it.
644660	648660	For many people, social status is what might change their position on coming out,
648660	650660	but even then, someone might be hesitant to,
650660	653660	because even if they have overwhelming support from their audience,
653660	657660	they may have pivotal family members they still would like to remain on good terms,
657660	660660	or they feel they have a sensitive relationship for.
660660	663660	We are not entitled to know someone's sexuality.
663660	666660	So this is something you have to be clear on, because if you're not,
666660	671660	how are all these other people that aren't you going to cope?
671660	676660	Sexuality is a general fact, that it can be very useful to know about a person for several reasons,
676660	679660	but we can't force people to disclose that either.
679660	682660	We don't know this person's life story, what they've been through,
682660	685660	if they haven't told people, if they'll lose their job, if they're in danger.
685660	689660	There are so many reasons someone might not be open about it.
689660	692660	We can preach the message that being out is good,
692660	697660	but aggressively speculating or trying to out someone is really bad.
697660	702660	They might not be gay, in which case we're just harassing someone and probably stereotyping,
702660	706660	and if they are, there's going to be a reason why they haven't talked about it.
706660	709660	What happens there will always be someone's own business,
709660	712660	and there may be justified reasons for why we haven't spoken about it.
712660	715660	But that's not the question we're trying to completely decipher here.
715660	719660	So although making people aware is a possible answer for this question,
719660	723660	at the same time there are many concerns surrounding it that might deter someone.
723660	726660	There has to be some more reasons, right?
726660	729660	Okay, let's look back at the assumption of heterosexuality.
729660	732660	That's an interesting one, because although many may assume such naturally,
732660	735660	we also have stereotypes, and in the instance of Dan,
735660	738660	although people weren't going to necessarily out him,
738660	741660	there were many people who created hypotheses around his identity
741660	744660	and why he had been relatively ambiguous about it.
744660	747660	But I'm pretty sure no one that knows me thinks I'm straight,
747660	752660	so I don't really need to come out as much as just clarify what the hell is going on.
752660	754660	And let's make that abundantly clear.
754660	759660	The absence of heterosexual behaviour is not evidence for homosexual behaviour,
759660	761660	but when people start making assumptions about your private life,
761660	763660	you feel the need to clarify,
763660	767660	because you don't want people misconstruing these sentiments that may be hard to read.
767660	771660	In all fairness, it might be better for some of these people not to read into these things at all.
771660	774660	But that's what people do, that's what our audiences will do.
774660	778660	When people use art to express their feelings like Dan did,
778660	781660	many committed fans want to use the art to look into their mind
781660	783660	and find out what feelings they truly have.
783660	786660	The nature of interpretation is fairly innocent and natural,
786660	790660	until people start carrying that through to your personal life and assuming relationships,
790660	795660	and so in this instance you might be motivated to give them directly information
795660	799660	that they can assure themselves with, to avoid any misconceptions.
799660	803660	So a coming out video can clear up possible misconceptions, right?
803660	807660	Well it doesn't necessarily mean that coming out is going to clear everything up,
807660	809660	particularly in the case of someone like Dan,
810660	815660	you could very easily tell that coming out might actually complicate people's ideas of relationships,
815660	820660	such as his one with Phil, another guy who has been relatively quiet on his sexual preferences.
820660	824660	This in the past has led people to hypothesising about their activities,
824660	829660	and now one of them has come out, the threat that people might try and use that as evidence to prove that point
829660	831660	hasn't really gone away.
831660	835660	Now I don't know Phil, but regardless of any assumption about his sexuality,
835660	841660	or even sexual activities could legitimately follow through to his social life if he is actively pursuing relationships,
841660	846660	so when dealing with these situations, it's important to be sensitive to the discussion at hand.
846660	850660	So when all these opportunities came for Dan and Phil, we were really excited,
850660	856660	but I was also scared as people clearly knew I wasn't straight, and I hadn't told my family that.
856660	862660	None of my old friends knew about this, and what me and Phil had was hours and personal,
862660	866660	yet some people were trying to get access to it for their own satisfaction.
866660	871660	It was no longer a few people on the internet, no big deal, so I just shut down.
871660	877660	Here's the thing, I'm somebody that wants to keep the details of my personal life private.
877660	878660	So is Phil.
878660	884660	I know lots of people these days, thanks to social media, want to share and monetise every aspect of their life,
884660	891660	and then as soon as something changes, suddenly it's this huge drama because everybody got invested in the story of your life like it's a soap opera.
891660	898660	I don't want that, I want to do certain things without an audience, I want to be spontaneous, I don't want to feel afraid to take risks,
898660	904660	I want to enjoy totally fucking something up and not have to post a public statement about it,
904660	911660	and if anyone thinks people really have to share these things about their life, you need to rethink your position.
911660	917660	However, in spite of how daunting it is, having a fanbase might also be a great reason to come out about these experiences,
917660	921660	particularly if your content typically may underline your own struggles.
921660	929660	It means that it is very possible that you have attained subscribers and viewers who encounter similar struggles and feel the way you deal with it resonate with them.
929660	937660	If their idol comes out about their own experiences, then it may be genuinely helpful to many people who are having trouble deciphering their own identity.
937660	942660	Nonetheless, it's still a tightrope as you don't want to promote your own experience as definitive,
942660	949660	you still want people to come to terms with themselves on their own basis, because no two people are completely the same,
949660	952660	even if they do have some degree of shared experiences.
952660	958660	And if anything motivated me, it's the idea that I can help someone else, because that's basically my whole career, isn't it?
958660	962660	Admitting to shit that I've been through so you will feel better about yourselves, there we go, you're welcome.
962660	968660	I have a platform and a following of millions of people, many of whom I know have been through exactly what I have,
968660	976660	and if I tell my story, as painful and flip-floppy and flawed as it is, I know it will mean something to someone,
976660	981660	as every time someone speaks openly about sexuality, it saves lives.
981660	985660	So, we've kind of covered all these sporadic reasons for coming out.
985660	993660	For the larger YouTubers, I'd say these are probably the more prevailing reasons, and obviously there will always be many minor reasons too.
993660	999660	And all of the reasons today that I've spoken about are still reasons to come out, they all just come with numerous amounts of reservations,
999660	1004660	and therefore it's definitely important that an established creator takes them into account when making a video,
1004660	1007660	which is exactly something Dan intended to do.
1007660	1011660	But there are still more hurdles that you face, which is what we'll discuss now.
1011660	1024660	It seems absurd in a way that once you decide that you want to come out, you need to consider how to come out.
1024660	1033660	On principle, it should not be the most complex information to deliver, and it's someone's own life, they should decide how to do it on their own terms, and not suffer for it.
1033660	1041660	For creators who may craft their content around LGBT issues specifically, then it's normally not a difficult challenge, because it fits into their content.
1041660	1047660	Coming out videos are unique in a way that typically, once again with reservation, they can only be done once.
1047660	1056660	You can't create a series of coming out videos, and you certainly don't want to be seen as exploiting a genre specifically designed for people who may be experiencing those issues.
1056660	1061660	Speaking casually, you have two options, you either make it an announcement, or you make it a statement.
1061660	1066660	An announcement will obviously have less impact, but sometimes that's what we want.
1066660	1076660	If it's not a message you feel completely compatible with the main tone of your channel, or if you don't feel comfortable in pulling something off like that, then it's nothing on you, but there isn't too much to add here.
1076660	1085660	So what we're going to be focusing on this part is the latter, making it a statement, which although much more powerful, comes with its own implications.
1085660	1091660	As a creator, these sorts of videos are never easy, because of the cultural hype surrounding coming out videos.
1091660	1099660	Even if you're a small channel, it's very possible that a coming out video, if done with impact and emotion, might blow up and gain international attention.
1099660	1103660	Now I know what you're thinking, isn't that great? Why wouldn't anyone want that?
1104660	1117660	Well if your channel isn't an inherently LGBT focused channel, then having one video that's going to do incredibly well yet doesn't fit in with your regular brand might bring across a load of attention that won't sustain itself.
1117660	1123660	It's not right, but it's how YouTube works. For anyone who is experienced knows this will yield multiple problems.
1123660	1131660	Firstly, it will give you a spike in subscribers who came for that kind of content, yet will inevitably lose interest when you don't continue in that direction,
1131660	1137660	and thus may unsubscribe, killing your momentum. This will also yield in a decreasing amount of interest from remaining subscribers,
1137660	1143660	which could impact the way that YouTube promotes your account, that's restricting you to the content that you might want to make,
1143660	1148660	and probably driving a lot of frustration as you have to continuously watch your subscriber count drop.
1148660	1153660	For many YouTubers, it's never really about the actual total subscriber count, it's about the trend.
1153660	1161660	Now although it seems harsh to look at these things from a business perspective, if you have a message to tell an audience, even if it's a more intimate or personal one,
1161660	1170660	you still have to keep in mind that you might be constructing a channel, and you don't want to completely shift the attention onto this one element that may not fully represent you.
1170660	1178660	Now over the last few years, we have seen more and more YouTubers who have, in the past, used their content as a fairly thick veil to their personal lives,
1178660	1182660	peel back the layers and reveal a more intimate, personal side to them.
1182660	1188660	Maybe because the original personal charms of bedroom blogging are gone, and people need new foundations to relate to these creators,
1188660	1194660	but whatever the reason is, the cultural paradigm has definitely moved towards an expectation of openness.
1194660	1199660	On top of this, the increasing acceptance of those who wish to come out from their audience has steadily grown,
1199660	1205660	and people with large and dedicated fanbases can hopefully feel more at ease being honest with them,
1205660	1208660	though it does depend on the genre that you're in of course.
1208660	1215660	Now as a larger YouTuber with an already established fanbase, a fairly simple video about your sexuality isn't going to be defining.
1215660	1221660	I mean, you don't even have to make a video to get the message out once you're a big enough public figure,
1221660	1223660	but that clearly wasn't the point for Dan.
1223660	1230660	To make a video like Dan's for a YouTuber is to make a statement, so he had to underline it with a sense of narrative,
1230660	1235660	and intertwine it with a serious issue while offsetting it with his classic brand of humour.
1235660	1238660	It's no surprise the video took so long to complete.
1238660	1245660	Even with the size and security of his channel, these factors were all things that Dan clearly wanted to take into account.
1245660	1251660	When I think back to the reasons that we make coming out videos, one of the points I didn't touch on is to develop a character,
1251660	1254660	and why wouldn't I say that on principle?
1254660	1258660	Well it's because sexuality itself doesn't directly define character,
1258660	1262660	but at the end of the day, if we acknowledge the label that comes with it as a social status,
1262660	1268660	then a lot of implications through experiences do come along that will define people, that will affect them.
1268660	1270660	Dan touches on these a lot in his video.
1270660	1277660	This experience, coming from a childhood hearing the word gay meaninglessly thrown around as an insult at home and school,
1277660	1287660	in music, on TV, to then realising I'm actually kinda gay, to then very specifically being attacked for it, was traumatic.
1287660	1295660	The world was clearly telling me if I ever wanted to be accepted by anyone, or in my particular environment, survive,
1295660	1303660	I couldn't be gay. I was afraid of it. Literally homophobic of myself.
1303660	1313660	I'm talking Pavlov, Sunken Place, North Korea level mind alteration that made me terrified of and repulsed by this part of me.
1313660	1319660	I think that's a really unique detail to his content, there's this lack of egoism to what he makes,
1319660	1324660	and plenty of people have gone on diatribes about how we can all be happy and accept ourselves,
1324660	1328660	but sometimes these speeches come across as very pandering,
1328660	1332660	because they're done without the perspective of what the issues really are,
1332660	1338660	and just telling someone that they can be happy, as glorious as it is, is only a part of many people's picture.
1338660	1346660	Howell takes these issues head on, identifying them in a detailed fashion, but then expanding them in a way that relates to a lot of people.
1346660	1351660	Now let me make it clear, this isn't the first time personal experiences have been touched on,
1351660	1356660	there's a great video regarding coming out by Katzen, and fantastically creative in its own right,
1356660	1360660	but equally I think the multifaceted narratives that Dan's video constructed,
1360660	1364660	tied together by an interaction between actions and consequences, private and public,
1364660	1369660	and the subsequent social messages that he actually promoted, really took the concept to a new level.
1369660	1373660	The great thing about Dan's videos is that he never seems conceited with what he creates,
1373660	1377660	it always feels like he's working on something new, even when he doesn't have to,
1377660	1380660	and on a video with such a social statement, that's important.
1380660	1385660	I think the fact that Dan took the effort when, on principle, the announcement could have carried it alone,
1385660	1388660	is a real testament to who he is as a creator.
1388660	1391660	As videos go, this was a tonal masterpiece.
1392660	1397660	This tale was just some of the stuff relating to sexuality, we all have a whole sob story if we wanna tell it,
1397660	1404660	but I just wanted to explain the journey of how I got to this point, and overcame the obstacles that tried to block this path.
1404660	1407660	And now, I've arrived.
1407660	1411660	So when it comes to how these videos created, he definitely got it right,
1411660	1417660	but there's one more point that has to be acknowledged, which really pushes the video over the top in my opinion.
1421660	1434660	The penultimate part of his video is concerned with labels,
1434660	1438660	now initially I felt confused as to why he had inserted this part towards the end,
1438660	1441660	after what had kinda felt like a moment of closure.
1441660	1447660	However, he really did justify it with arguably the point that pulled this whole video together,
1447660	1450660	and revealed the underlying message to me at least, judgement.
1450660	1455660	Throughout the video, Howell makes multiple references to the sort of judgement that he was subjected to,
1455660	1461660	on the basis of those labels, and circumstances that no one could ever truly really know about other than him.
1461660	1468660	Judgement is inevitable in many ways, but it manifested into behaviour that ultimately led to a lot of personal struggles,
1468660	1470660	whether that was the intent or not.
1470660	1475660	And this leads him to his final section, fear, where he really manages to speak to everyone.
1475660	1479660	In the past, people have had to come out with the hope of acceptance for who they are.
1479660	1482660	This video changed that, it flipped it.
1482660	1485660	It was a message of why you should accept people for who they are,
1485660	1490660	and not ostracise or exclude them for elements of their identity that are beyond their control.
1490660	1496660	Dan turns the narrative on his head and puts the responsibility much more squarely on other people.
1496660	1504660	The story he tells is of a lad who strives for acceptance in a community that has given those behaviours labels with negative connotations
1504660	1508660	due to the deviation from the social perspective of normality.
1508660	1514660	Eventually, this comes in a weird circle with him realising that there is nothing really wrong with being different,
1514660	1521660	both finding that difference and acceptance in multiple aspects of his life, his content included.
1521660	1525660	As mentioned, Dan's content did really connect with who he was as a person,
1525660	1529660	so a coming out video would certainly keep in line with this evolution,
1529660	1536660	as it's likely that a lot of the struggles that he experienced and channeled due to his sexuality were embedded in the content that he made.
1536660	1539660	There is so much controversy around this issue and others,
1539660	1545660	but if we all just calm down, respect each other's experiences and try to just be nice, reasonable people,
1545660	1548660	which is a lot to ask, let's be real, it's quite simple.
1548660	1552660	If you want to use language to express your honest feelings and identity, that's great,
1552660	1555660	and other people should respect what you say.
1555660	1560660	Likewise, if you hate labels and you just want to be a formless blob, that's fine too, no one should force you.
1560660	1566660	The only thing that isn't cool is telling other people what they should or should not identify as,
1566660	1569660	because that ain't your problem or your business, bye.
1569660	1573660	This video was not just an important video for a multitude of reasons,
1573660	1577660	but it was an important continuation rather than a diversion from what he creates.
1577660	1584660	With all the context around his identity in the previous years, it leads him to find a moment of strength in great vulnerability,
1585660	1590660	and with that in mind, I think HAL really reinvigorated the coming out video in many ways.
1590660	1596660	For too long, there is this constant concern that many people have that these types of videos will be commodified
1596660	1603660	for the YouTube machine, given YouTube's own track record, and this video blasted any hashtag proud to be video out of the water.
1603660	1608660	In the first part of my analysis, I set out basic reasons why someone might make a video,
1608660	1613660	to make people aware, to clear up misconceptions, to help others who may be in a similar predicament,
1613660	1616660	and to provide development to his own character.
1616660	1621660	Dan covered all these, and more, and this is not to say that other videos aren't important in their own right.
1621660	1628660	Less than a couple days later, Eugene Lee Yang came out in another video that was a strong statement of self expression,
1628660	1634660	but I don't think I've watched a coming out video that just felt so right, and I don't know how to express it like that.
1634660	1640660	It struck the balance between personal and universal, it allowed him to present new pieces of himself,
1640660	1644660	while not necessarily binding his personality to his character.
1644660	1650660	It was a cathartic moment that many have been anticipating, but even then, it defied expectations.
1650660	1655660	It was a mutual experience for him and the audience, and I'm trying not to sound preachy.
1655660	1661660	And of course, I know that's just my opinion, but I know that a lot of people feel the same,
1661660	1667660	and that's equally important, when we watch figures online retelling their stories, when we invest ourselves in them,
1667660	1673660	we want to be confident that what they're saying is the truth, because we may be encountering the same struggles that they went through,
1673660	1678660	and we may be looking to explain it in a way that can help us understand ourselves.
1678660	1685660	The fact that Howell took so much time to explain in detail these feelings and using them to convey messages was a real favour,
1685660	1690660	he genuinely didn't have to, and I have little doubt that he has just helped a lot of people.
1690660	1693660	I'm so glad I failed, for so many reasons.
1693660	1698660	For the people in my life, for the future I would have wasted,
1698660	1708660	the most important being that I thought I was trapped in a situation forever, when in reality, the entire world I lived in and my life changed completely.
1708660	1714660	I thought it was hopeless, when in reality, there was so much to hope for, and that's it.
1714660	1717660	Time changes everything.
1717660	1721660	In the lives that we have, we can try anything we've dreamed of.
1721660	1726660	I want anyone that's ever felt like this to realise you are never trapped.
1726660	1732660	There is always hope. You just need to believe in yourself and get to the other side.
1732660	1735660	For anyone who doesn't know, might be the odd couple of people, I'm gay,
1735660	1740660	and I've never really been one to make a coming out video in such a way for multiple reasons,
1740660	1747660	mainly because I'm a guy who comments on YouTube affairs, and I've always perceived it as feeling out of place with the rest of my content.
1747660	1749660	It's never been who I am.
1749660	1753660	I'm also someone who doesn't like to integrate too much of his personal life,
1753660	1756660	but I still put the information out there for those who want to know,
1756660	1760660	because at the end of the day, I really had trouble accepting myself,
1760660	1766660	because my demeanour didn't exactly conform to the gay stereotypes that had been presented to me while I was growing up,
1766660	1771660	and when I finally deciphered it at the ripe age of 18, I felt like I'd lost so much time,
1771660	1773660	and I wouldn't wish that on anyone.
1773660	1777660	That doesn't mean that I think everyone should just jump straight in the deep end,
1777660	1781660	but I think that at a time when so many people were exploring their sexuality,
1781660	1785660	I was just sat there like a lemming waiting to be attracted to women.
1785660	1787660	I really could have used a few hints.
1787660	1793660	You can't change the past, there's no point in being bitter about influences other than catharsis,
1793660	1795660	but even then it'll wear you out.
1795660	1800660	The best thing that we all can do is know the challenges, know what put us there,
1800660	1804660	and provide the insight to help others traverse it on their own terms.
1804660	1807660	Since starting my channel, and uploading videos of course,
1807660	1810660	it's really neat to have people reach out to me in similar places,
1810660	1814660	and saying that me talking about my experiences resonated with them,
1814660	1819660	and how it helped them come to terms with various aspects of their life, sexuality included.
1819660	1823660	It's never really an effect I considered until people started telling me.
1823660	1829660	You always feel like your experiences are so isolated, but so often you're not alone.
1829660	1832660	People's sexuality will always be their own story,
1832660	1835660	and that's a story they are under no obligation to share.
1835660	1839660	When someone decides to be open about it, it can make a real difference,
1839660	1843660	and therefore both as someone who's been on the giving and receiving end of this dynamic,
1843660	1845660	no pun intended you freaks,
1845660	1848660	it gives me a greater appreciation for a video like Dan's.
1848660	1854660	Throughout the years, since 2009, Dan has represented a quintessential YouTuber in many ways,
1854660	1859660	making content with the sort of sincerity that subverts the mainstream entertainment genre,
1859660	1863660	while still producing some great comedy, often underlying strong messages.
1863660	1866660	With this video, none of that really changes.
1866660	1872660	I mean sure, due to the seriousness of the topic, it's obviously marginally less laugh out loud comedic,
1872660	1876660	but nothing will alienate his audiences that have come to know and love him.
1876660	1881660	It builds on his character, and many of the relationships fans might have had with it,
1881660	1886660	and to see such a mainstream person do this, it will instil a lot of confidence in people lacking it.
1886660	1891660	At the same time, he's created a video that could have been a fairly casual upload,
1891660	1895660	yet delivers something incredibly meaningful, adding a lot of new value
1895660	1900660	to a long-standing bastion of a community that can sometimes seem completely lost.
1900660	1903660	He'll have created a lot of new fans through this as well,
1903660	1905660	because even if you're not wholly familiar with him,
1905660	1910660	the fact that he touched on a lot of relatable experiences made it highly accessible.
1910660	1915660	It's a great video, for multiple reasons, but it's an important one too,
1915660	1918660	with a familiar, yet transcendent message.
1918660	1922660	To anyone watching this that isn't out, it's okay. You're okay.
1922660	1927660	You were born this way, it's right, and anyone that has a problem with it is wrong.
1927660	1930660	Based on your circumstance, you might not feel ready to tell people yet,
1930660	1933660	or that it's safe, and that's fine too.
1933660	1939660	Just know that living your truth with pride is the way to be happy.
1939660	1945660	You are valid, it gets so much better, and the future is clear.
1945660	1947660	It's pretty queer.
1947660	1951660	Acceptance, from people, for people.
1951660	1954660	Unless they like pineapple on pizza and then they can get f***ed.
1954660	1959660	I had to finish it on a joke, didn't I?
1959660	1961660	Ruining everything, as always.
1961660	1965660	Anyhow, I'd love to give a big shoutout to my editors.
1965660	1968660	I'm sure they have once again done a fantastic job.
1968660	1971660	I'm envisioning it right now, and I love it as much as ever.
1971660	1974660	I want to give a big thanks to my Patreons.
1974660	1977660	Fantastic, fantastic people.
1977660	1982660	I need to give a special shoutout to some very special Patreons.

2009660	2012660	I don't think we've even ever spoken yet, just incredible.
2012660	2015660	These people have that sort of face, so thank you guys.
2015660	2018660	And EveningSteal, another long-term supporter of the channel.
2018660	2022660	They recently actually, it was the last couple of months, they upped their pledge.
2022660	2024660	You know, I'm genuinely endeared by that.
2024660	2027660	When someone does that, you know, going one step above
2027660	2030660	feels like we're moving on up in the world, my friends.
2030660	2033660	And hopefully that's what we'll be doing.
2033660	2038660	Obviously, if you want to reach me, you can get in touch with me on Twitter, Facebook, and Discord.
2038660	2041660	I'll be leaving links to those in the pinned comments.
2041660	2043660	I do not have too much else to add.
2043660	2046660	Just want to thank you guys for the support, as always.
2046660	2048660	It just genuinely makes a difference.
2048660	2052660	Hopefully, now I'm out of university, we'll be on an open road.
2052660	2056660	So, until I'm driving down that open road, I guess I'm the right opinion,
2056660	2059660	and I'll see you in the next one.
2068660	2077660	Thanks for watching!
