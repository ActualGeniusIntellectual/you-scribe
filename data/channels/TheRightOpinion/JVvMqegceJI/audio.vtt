00:00.000 --> 00:05.580
Two brothers come up to me, aged 7 and 8, with an unexplained, aggressive look in their eye.

00:05.580 --> 00:14.120
And the younger one pushes me to the ground, kicks me in the stomach, and just says,

00:14.120 --> 00:15.120
GAY.

00:15.120 --> 00:25.460
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

00:25.460 --> 00:29.960
And as I begin to record this lovely voiceover, we are 24 days into Pride Month,

00:29.960 --> 00:35.160
the delightful time of the year where LGBT individuals have a chance to celebrate their identity.

00:35.160 --> 00:38.760
Now, by the time this video is released, it will probably be mid-July earliest.

00:38.760 --> 00:43.260
Anything before that will probably be a miracle, and I'll have to find a way to celebrate.

00:43.260 --> 00:48.460
But given my track record of how to celebrate, I might open myself up to suggestions.

00:48.460 --> 00:52.660
But yes, it's Pride Month, and I assume most of you guys have the memo for what happens.

00:52.660 --> 01:01.160
Now, the community has a very significant online presence, and it's perfectly natural that many people

01:01.160 --> 01:06.660
may take the hopefully supportive atmosphere to talk about their experiences, or even come out themselves.

01:06.660 --> 01:12.160
YouTube, in spite of its rocky relationship with the LGBT community for many justified reasons,

01:12.160 --> 01:18.660
provided one of the greatest, most personal mediums for creators to have unique moments that would not be captured on the television,

01:18.660 --> 01:21.860
making the individual the direct owner of their creation.

01:21.860 --> 01:26.560
Managing to create content more personal, and with personal content comes personal problems.

01:26.560 --> 01:29.360
One of those prevailing problems was sexuality.

01:29.360 --> 01:32.560
The internet is a hotbed for social outcasts for many reasons,

01:32.560 --> 01:39.560
and YouTube was a platform for those to converge in a place where they didn't need the socially accepted qualifications to go places.

01:39.560 --> 01:45.560
This led to a real platform for the LGBT community, with one of the real staples being coming out videos.

01:45.560 --> 01:48.160
Coming out videos are pretty self-explanatory.

01:48.160 --> 01:54.160
They involve one individual coming out as LGBTQ to friends, family, or even you, the audience.

01:54.160 --> 01:59.160
It was a meaningful experience for both creators, who may have felt isolated in their moment of vulnerability,

01:59.160 --> 02:04.160
and audiences who may be looking for that guidance on how to traverse these scenarios themselves.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.660
YouTube's importance is undeniable.

02:06.660 --> 02:11.660
However, it's not every day a highly popular, reputable public figure decides not just to come out,

02:11.660 --> 02:17.660
but to come out in a way that deals with it in an incredibly introspective and detailed fashion with multiple social statements.

02:17.660 --> 02:21.660
However, the individual that I have designed to cover today has done just that.

02:21.660 --> 02:26.160
The individual is Daniel Howell, also known from the YouTube duo Dan and Phil.

02:26.160 --> 02:28.660
Howell is a bonafide YouTube unit.

02:28.660 --> 02:37.160
He has been on the platform since 2009, and really does represent the wholesome online come up that many people like to visualize regarding the website.

02:37.160 --> 02:42.660
His style definitely represented the syndicate of sketch YouTubers that were sprouting from the fertile earth at that point.

02:42.660 --> 02:47.660
But make no mistake, Howell was his own creator and definitely represented the Brits well on that side,

02:47.660 --> 02:51.660
capturing the irony-tainted cynicism that is signature to much of our humor.

02:51.660 --> 02:54.160
He's also content that has aged incredibly well.

02:54.160 --> 02:58.160
In this video, he basically predicts or recognizes stan culture.

02:58.160 --> 03:06.660
And of course you have to follow them on Twitter, but it is important that you at reply everything that they say within the first 12 seconds of them posting a tweet,

03:06.660 --> 03:11.660
because otherwise you're just gonna be lost in the crowd, so you need to be right on the mark,

03:11.660 --> 03:15.660
just replying to absolutely everything they ever say.

03:15.660 --> 03:20.160
And at this point, it is important to remember that you do have to be interesting.

03:20.160 --> 03:24.160
If you're boring, then they just won't care who you are.

03:24.160 --> 03:31.160
So, you know, read their MySpace interests, watch their Tumblr posts, and you know, write down a list of what you think they're interested in,

03:31.160 --> 03:34.160
so you can at least pretend you have similar interests.

03:34.160 --> 03:39.660
Nonetheless, in spite of the very idiosyncratically British tone, this received appreciation from across the globe,

03:39.660 --> 03:42.660
and his channel proceeded to gain a strong amount of traction.

03:42.660 --> 03:49.160
He continued to work with his compadre, Phil Lester of AmazingPhil, and created some very entertaining sketch content

03:49.160 --> 03:54.160
that continued to thrive for a good few years, increasing production values, furthering the creative vision,

03:54.160 --> 04:02.660
working on new channels such as their epic gaming ventures, and moving even beyond YouTube, most notably to their show on BBC Radio 1.

04:02.660 --> 04:07.160
The fact that at a time where YouTube still wasn't quite at its level of cultural magnitude,

04:07.160 --> 04:13.160
a pair of British lads could use that content to gain a spot, and arguably the most iconic British radio station,

04:13.160 --> 04:18.160
should be a real testament to how significant they were in the landscape of YouTube.

04:18.160 --> 04:23.660
However, when you have all that fame dropped in your lap, you sometimes find it difficult to express who you really are.

04:23.660 --> 04:30.660
Content will always be reflective of an individual to an extent, but at the same time, it's not going to tell you who the person behind the camera is,

04:30.660 --> 04:34.660
and people start to theorise, for various reasons that we'll break down in a bit.

04:35.660 --> 04:42.660
Dan even entertained a purposefully bizarre fanfiction, which in hindsight I think was meant to be a bait and a switch

04:42.660 --> 04:48.660
for those who wanted to find out more about him and Phil's relationship, perhaps even taking a shot at those same theorists.

04:48.660 --> 04:54.660
Dan had no interest in going. His friendship with Phil was personal to him and not something he wanted to share with family and friends

04:54.660 --> 04:57.160
who would mean well but insult with every word of comfort.

04:57.160 --> 05:03.660
I always received the impression that many of Dan's videos were just meant to be ironic takedowns masqueraded in fan popular content,

05:03.660 --> 05:10.660
and I'm kind of there for it. Nonetheless, the questions remained and persisted, and at a point, Dan just kind of went quiet on the content front.

05:10.660 --> 05:16.660
Now, unlike Phil, he was not necessarily known for his incredibly regular uploads, and when you get this deep into your career,

05:16.660 --> 05:23.660
sometimes it's therapeutic to take a break, and it wasn't like he fell off the face of the Earth, so no one was really ready for what he was about to drop.

05:23.660 --> 05:28.660
What dropped was a video in which Dan came out. However, it was more than that.

05:28.660 --> 05:35.660
Throughout the video, Dan revisits his past and the history, the experiences that shaped him, how these things had grown to interact with him

05:35.660 --> 05:41.660
as he had progressed with his career and developed as a public figure, and how they had continued to affect him for better and for worse.

05:41.660 --> 05:47.660
These sort of expectations people had placed onto him, and how they had ultimately led up to this moment.

05:47.660 --> 05:55.660
Hello internet. However, it's a bit more than that. We're going to be going into a bit of a deeper philosophical dive today,

05:55.660 --> 06:02.660
and trying to break down the various aspects of coming out videos, their difficulty, their challenge, and sometimes their weaknesses,

06:02.660 --> 06:08.660
but we'll also be going into why they're important, why they matter, and why, with respect to all of these conditions and factors,

06:08.660 --> 06:15.660
I feel that Dan Howell really did something else with a type of video that is often overlooked in the cultural impact they could have.

06:15.660 --> 06:21.660
I'm going to be showing some clips to try and capture the energy of his video, but if you want it done justice, go and watch the whole thing.

06:22.660 --> 06:25.660
So, without further ado, I suggest we get into it.

06:27.660 --> 06:33.660
In the list of things that identify a person, one of the most important for other people to know is their sexuality.

06:33.660 --> 06:42.660
For if sex is the primal force propelling all of these humans forward by their hips, they have to know, are we gonna fuck?

06:42.660 --> 06:46.660
So the first question I should put to you is, why come out?

06:46.660 --> 06:52.660
Now I don't mean generally here, I mean in the fact that you would make a video with regards to coming out to your audience.

06:52.660 --> 06:58.660
I mean on principle, it's a fairly simple answer, at least it used to be, that you want people to be aware,

06:58.660 --> 07:02.660
but as a creator you immediately have to face some nuances that reflect your channel.

07:02.660 --> 07:06.660
Who do you want to be aware? What sort of awareness are you raising?

07:06.660 --> 07:10.660
The easiest solution is to have people aware when they are introduced to the brand.

07:10.660 --> 07:14.660
If they want, they can look up a creator and find out their sexuality,

07:14.660 --> 07:17.660
and that forgets one of the main purposes why someone comes online,

07:17.660 --> 07:21.660
particularly if they see YouTube as an escape from the troublesome real world.

07:21.660 --> 07:25.660
You immediately hit a fairly tough catch-22 as a small YouTuber.

07:25.660 --> 07:30.660
In Dan's instance, he was a face cam YouTuber, so anyone who knew him could immediately identify him,

07:30.660 --> 07:35.660
and that could lead to more real life problems, and without having an online life that's remotely sustainable,

07:35.660 --> 07:37.660
that would be dangerous on his behalf.

07:37.660 --> 07:41.660
Now although in his coming out video he makes it clear that there were people who didn't know,

07:41.660 --> 07:47.660
he also shows that the animosity these people reacted with typically deterred him from being public about his sexuality.

07:47.660 --> 07:53.660
I was six years old, running around the playground, pretending to be Sonic the Hedgehog or something,

07:53.660 --> 07:58.660
when two brothers come up to me, aged seven and eight, with an unexplained aggressive look in their eye,

07:58.660 --> 08:03.660
and the younger one pushes me to the ground, kicks me in the stomach, and just says,

08:03.660 --> 08:06.660
Gay.

08:06.660 --> 08:10.660
This was the first time I ever heard that word.

08:10.660 --> 08:15.660
Well, I don't know what the heck gay means, but apparently it means people kick you on the floor, so that ain't good.

08:15.660 --> 08:19.660
This one little shit who I won't name was one of the school bullies, and he loved the word gay.

08:19.660 --> 08:22.660
He had it in for me, and I have no idea why.

08:22.660 --> 08:25.660
You know me, Mr. Winnie the Pooh meets Slender Man.

08:25.660 --> 08:28.660
Well, when I was ten, just Winnie the Pooh.

08:28.660 --> 08:33.660
I didn't do nothing to no one ever, and yet this guy used my pacifism as a punching bag,

08:33.660 --> 08:38.660
where any group situation was an excuse to single me out, call me gay for some reason,

08:38.660 --> 08:41.660
and then make everyone else exclude me because they were scared of him.

08:41.660 --> 08:48.660
So for a year, I literally had no friends, and this is when the bullying at school really stepped its pussy up.

08:48.660 --> 08:54.660
The things people used to say offhand to me in a corridor were now said loudly in classrooms, where everybody would laugh.

08:54.660 --> 08:59.660
People used to sing songs about me being gay on the bus, while my fellow nerds sat around me,

08:59.660 --> 09:02.660
just stared awkwardly out of the window, not wanting to get involved.

09:02.660 --> 09:06.660
People shouted things out during GCSE exams in front of the whole school,

09:06.660 --> 09:09.660
and the low-key pushing became punches.

09:09.660 --> 09:12.660
People used to wait for me after school just to throw things at me,

09:12.660 --> 09:18.660
once a guy put his hand around my throat and pushed my head against a coat peg in the locker room while everyone was watching,

09:18.660 --> 09:20.660
and just slapped me for five minutes.

09:20.660 --> 09:27.660
Therefore, when creating his original content, it would have been a risky move to also have a sexuality public due to the real-life implications.

09:27.660 --> 09:32.660
In society as it is, people work from the assumption that an individual is straight,

09:32.660 --> 09:37.660
and therefore when someone is not straight and keeps themselves from the audience for the sake of self-protection,

09:37.660 --> 09:40.660
if they do manage to expand their channel and grow out their content,

09:40.660 --> 09:44.660
when they feel the shackles of approval from certain social figures alleviate,

09:44.660 --> 09:47.660
it feels like given people's assumption of heterosexuality,

09:47.660 --> 09:52.660
there is this burden, that feeling that you're not being as open with your audience as you could be.

09:52.660 --> 10:02.660
Here I am, age 27, and my sexual preference is seemingly still a vague, debatable, confusing, impenetrable mystery.

10:02.660 --> 10:05.660
Equally, once you've established a clear relationship with your audience,

10:05.660 --> 10:09.660
you become hesitant to alter it by releasing a coming out video,

10:09.660 --> 10:13.660
because you don't know if your brand is ready to take on a message like that.

10:13.660 --> 10:17.660
There's no shame in not coming out to your audience, remember that.

10:17.660 --> 10:20.660
Sometimes it can even be just based on technicality.

10:20.660 --> 10:24.660
There's an amount of videos that I've wanted to sit down and make just personal and talking to the camera,

10:24.660 --> 10:28.660
yet I've always felt restraint when trying to make any video because honestly,

10:28.660 --> 10:31.660
I don't think it'd fit well within what I normally do.

10:31.660 --> 10:35.660
It's a difficult leap to make for multiple reasons that we'll indulge in, in a bit.

10:35.660 --> 10:38.660
So I'm only telling a few people on the internet right now,

10:38.660 --> 10:44.660
it's not like one day I'm gonna get so many followers that random strangers in my family might see it.

10:44.660 --> 10:48.660
For many people, social status is what might change their position on coming out,

10:48.660 --> 10:50.660
but even then, someone might be hesitant to,

10:50.660 --> 10:53.660
because even if they have overwhelming support from their audience,

10:53.660 --> 10:57.660
they may have pivotal family members they still would like to remain on good terms,

10:57.660 --> 11:00.660
or they feel they have a sensitive relationship for.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.660
We are not entitled to know someone's sexuality.

11:03.660 --> 11:06.660
So this is something you have to be clear on, because if you're not,

11:06.660 --> 11:11.660
how are all these other people that aren't you going to cope?

11:11.660 --> 11:16.660
Sexuality is a general fact, that it can be very useful to know about a person for several reasons,

11:16.660 --> 11:19.660
but we can't force people to disclose that either.

11:19.660 --> 11:22.660
We don't know this person's life story, what they've been through,

11:22.660 --> 11:25.660
if they haven't told people, if they'll lose their job, if they're in danger.

11:25.660 --> 11:29.660
There are so many reasons someone might not be open about it.

11:29.660 --> 11:32.660
We can preach the message that being out is good,

11:32.660 --> 11:37.660
but aggressively speculating or trying to out someone is really bad.

11:37.660 --> 11:42.660
They might not be gay, in which case we're just harassing someone and probably stereotyping,

11:42.660 --> 11:46.660
and if they are, there's going to be a reason why they haven't talked about it.

11:46.660 --> 11:49.660
What happens there will always be someone's own business,

11:49.660 --> 11:52.660
and there may be justified reasons for why we haven't spoken about it.

11:52.660 --> 11:55.660
But that's not the question we're trying to completely decipher here.

11:55.660 --> 11:59.660
So although making people aware is a possible answer for this question,

11:59.660 --> 12:03.660
at the same time there are many concerns surrounding it that might deter someone.

12:03.660 --> 12:06.660
There has to be some more reasons, right?

12:06.660 --> 12:09.660
Okay, let's look back at the assumption of heterosexuality.

12:09.660 --> 12:12.660
That's an interesting one, because although many may assume such naturally,

12:12.660 --> 12:15.660
we also have stereotypes, and in the instance of Dan,

12:15.660 --> 12:18.660
although people weren't going to necessarily out him,

12:18.660 --> 12:21.660
there were many people who created hypotheses around his identity

12:21.660 --> 12:24.660
and why he had been relatively ambiguous about it.

12:24.660 --> 12:27.660
But I'm pretty sure no one that knows me thinks I'm straight,

12:27.660 --> 12:32.660
so I don't really need to come out as much as just clarify what the hell is going on.

12:32.660 --> 12:34.660
And let's make that abundantly clear.

12:34.660 --> 12:39.660
The absence of heterosexual behaviour is not evidence for homosexual behaviour,

12:39.660 --> 12:41.660
but when people start making assumptions about your private life,

12:41.660 --> 12:43.660
you feel the need to clarify,

12:43.660 --> 12:47.660
because you don't want people misconstruing these sentiments that may be hard to read.

12:47.660 --> 12:51.660
In all fairness, it might be better for some of these people not to read into these things at all.

12:51.660 --> 12:54.660
But that's what people do, that's what our audiences will do.

12:54.660 --> 12:58.660
When people use art to express their feelings like Dan did,

12:58.660 --> 13:01.660
many committed fans want to use the art to look into their mind

13:01.660 --> 13:03.660
and find out what feelings they truly have.

13:03.660 --> 13:06.660
The nature of interpretation is fairly innocent and natural,

13:06.660 --> 13:10.660
until people start carrying that through to your personal life and assuming relationships,

13:10.660 --> 13:15.660
and so in this instance you might be motivated to give them directly information

13:15.660 --> 13:19.660
that they can assure themselves with, to avoid any misconceptions.

13:19.660 --> 13:23.660
So a coming out video can clear up possible misconceptions, right?

13:23.660 --> 13:27.660
Well it doesn't necessarily mean that coming out is going to clear everything up,

13:27.660 --> 13:29.660
particularly in the case of someone like Dan,

13:30.660 --> 13:35.660
you could very easily tell that coming out might actually complicate people's ideas of relationships,

13:35.660 --> 13:40.660
such as his one with Phil, another guy who has been relatively quiet on his sexual preferences.

13:40.660 --> 13:44.660
This in the past has led people to hypothesising about their activities,

13:44.660 --> 13:49.660
and now one of them has come out, the threat that people might try and use that as evidence to prove that point

13:49.660 --> 13:51.660
hasn't really gone away.

13:51.660 --> 13:55.660
Now I don't know Phil, but regardless of any assumption about his sexuality,

13:55.660 --> 14:01.660
or even sexual activities could legitimately follow through to his social life if he is actively pursuing relationships,

14:01.660 --> 14:06.660
so when dealing with these situations, it's important to be sensitive to the discussion at hand.

14:06.660 --> 14:10.660
So when all these opportunities came for Dan and Phil, we were really excited,

14:10.660 --> 14:16.660
but I was also scared as people clearly knew I wasn't straight, and I hadn't told my family that.

14:16.660 --> 14:22.660
None of my old friends knew about this, and what me and Phil had was hours and personal,

14:22.660 --> 14:26.660
yet some people were trying to get access to it for their own satisfaction.

14:26.660 --> 14:31.660
It was no longer a few people on the internet, no big deal, so I just shut down.

14:31.660 --> 14:37.660
Here's the thing, I'm somebody that wants to keep the details of my personal life private.

14:37.660 --> 14:38.660
So is Phil.

14:38.660 --> 14:44.660
I know lots of people these days, thanks to social media, want to share and monetise every aspect of their life,

14:44.660 --> 14:51.660
and then as soon as something changes, suddenly it's this huge drama because everybody got invested in the story of your life like it's a soap opera.

14:51.660 --> 14:58.660
I don't want that, I want to do certain things without an audience, I want to be spontaneous, I don't want to feel afraid to take risks,

14:58.660 --> 15:04.660
I want to enjoy totally fucking something up and not have to post a public statement about it,

15:04.660 --> 15:11.660
and if anyone thinks people really have to share these things about their life, you need to rethink your position.

15:11.660 --> 15:17.660
However, in spite of how daunting it is, having a fanbase might also be a great reason to come out about these experiences,

15:17.660 --> 15:21.660
particularly if your content typically may underline your own struggles.

15:21.660 --> 15:29.660
It means that it is very possible that you have attained subscribers and viewers who encounter similar struggles and feel the way you deal with it resonate with them.

15:29.660 --> 15:37.660
If their idol comes out about their own experiences, then it may be genuinely helpful to many people who are having trouble deciphering their own identity.

15:37.660 --> 15:42.660
Nonetheless, it's still a tightrope as you don't want to promote your own experience as definitive,

15:42.660 --> 15:49.660
you still want people to come to terms with themselves on their own basis, because no two people are completely the same,

15:49.660 --> 15:52.660
even if they do have some degree of shared experiences.

15:52.660 --> 15:58.660
And if anything motivated me, it's the idea that I can help someone else, because that's basically my whole career, isn't it?

15:58.660 --> 16:02.660
Admitting to shit that I've been through so you will feel better about yourselves, there we go, you're welcome.

16:02.660 --> 16:08.660
I have a platform and a following of millions of people, many of whom I know have been through exactly what I have,

16:08.660 --> 16:16.660
and if I tell my story, as painful and flip-floppy and flawed as it is, I know it will mean something to someone,

16:16.660 --> 16:21.660
as every time someone speaks openly about sexuality, it saves lives.

16:21.660 --> 16:25.660
So, we've kind of covered all these sporadic reasons for coming out.

16:25.660 --> 16:33.660
For the larger YouTubers, I'd say these are probably the more prevailing reasons, and obviously there will always be many minor reasons too.

16:33.660 --> 16:39.660
And all of the reasons today that I've spoken about are still reasons to come out, they all just come with numerous amounts of reservations,

16:39.660 --> 16:44.660
and therefore it's definitely important that an established creator takes them into account when making a video,

16:44.660 --> 16:47.660
which is exactly something Dan intended to do.

16:47.660 --> 16:51.660
But there are still more hurdles that you face, which is what we'll discuss now.

16:51.660 --> 17:04.660
It seems absurd in a way that once you decide that you want to come out, you need to consider how to come out.

17:04.660 --> 17:13.660
On principle, it should not be the most complex information to deliver, and it's someone's own life, they should decide how to do it on their own terms, and not suffer for it.

17:13.660 --> 17:21.660
For creators who may craft their content around LGBT issues specifically, then it's normally not a difficult challenge, because it fits into their content.

17:21.660 --> 17:27.660
Coming out videos are unique in a way that typically, once again with reservation, they can only be done once.

17:27.660 --> 17:36.660
You can't create a series of coming out videos, and you certainly don't want to be seen as exploiting a genre specifically designed for people who may be experiencing those issues.

17:36.660 --> 17:41.660
Speaking casually, you have two options, you either make it an announcement, or you make it a statement.

17:41.660 --> 17:46.660
An announcement will obviously have less impact, but sometimes that's what we want.

17:46.660 --> 17:56.660
If it's not a message you feel completely compatible with the main tone of your channel, or if you don't feel comfortable in pulling something off like that, then it's nothing on you, but there isn't too much to add here.

17:56.660 --> 18:05.660
So what we're going to be focusing on this part is the latter, making it a statement, which although much more powerful, comes with its own implications.

18:05.660 --> 18:11.660
As a creator, these sorts of videos are never easy, because of the cultural hype surrounding coming out videos.

18:11.660 --> 18:19.660
Even if you're a small channel, it's very possible that a coming out video, if done with impact and emotion, might blow up and gain international attention.

18:19.660 --> 18:23.660
Now I know what you're thinking, isn't that great? Why wouldn't anyone want that?

18:24.660 --> 18:37.660
Well if your channel isn't an inherently LGBT focused channel, then having one video that's going to do incredibly well yet doesn't fit in with your regular brand might bring across a load of attention that won't sustain itself.

18:37.660 --> 18:43.660
It's not right, but it's how YouTube works. For anyone who is experienced knows this will yield multiple problems.

18:43.660 --> 18:51.660
Firstly, it will give you a spike in subscribers who came for that kind of content, yet will inevitably lose interest when you don't continue in that direction,

18:51.660 --> 18:57.660
and thus may unsubscribe, killing your momentum. This will also yield in a decreasing amount of interest from remaining subscribers,

18:57.660 --> 19:03.660
which could impact the way that YouTube promotes your account, that's restricting you to the content that you might want to make,

19:03.660 --> 19:08.660
and probably driving a lot of frustration as you have to continuously watch your subscriber count drop.

19:08.660 --> 19:13.660
For many YouTubers, it's never really about the actual total subscriber count, it's about the trend.

19:13.660 --> 19:21.660
Now although it seems harsh to look at these things from a business perspective, if you have a message to tell an audience, even if it's a more intimate or personal one,

19:21.660 --> 19:30.660
you still have to keep in mind that you might be constructing a channel, and you don't want to completely shift the attention onto this one element that may not fully represent you.

19:30.660 --> 19:38.660
Now over the last few years, we have seen more and more YouTubers who have, in the past, used their content as a fairly thick veil to their personal lives,

19:38.660 --> 19:42.660
peel back the layers and reveal a more intimate, personal side to them.

19:42.660 --> 19:48.660
Maybe because the original personal charms of bedroom blogging are gone, and people need new foundations to relate to these creators,

19:48.660 --> 19:54.660
but whatever the reason is, the cultural paradigm has definitely moved towards an expectation of openness.

19:54.660 --> 19:59.660
On top of this, the increasing acceptance of those who wish to come out from their audience has steadily grown,

19:59.660 --> 20:05.660
and people with large and dedicated fanbases can hopefully feel more at ease being honest with them,

20:05.660 --> 20:08.660
though it does depend on the genre that you're in of course.

20:08.660 --> 20:15.660
Now as a larger YouTuber with an already established fanbase, a fairly simple video about your sexuality isn't going to be defining.

20:15.660 --> 20:21.660
I mean, you don't even have to make a video to get the message out once you're a big enough public figure,

20:21.660 --> 20:23.660
but that clearly wasn't the point for Dan.

20:23.660 --> 20:30.660
To make a video like Dan's for a YouTuber is to make a statement, so he had to underline it with a sense of narrative,

20:30.660 --> 20:35.660
and intertwine it with a serious issue while offsetting it with his classic brand of humour.

20:35.660 --> 20:38.660
It's no surprise the video took so long to complete.

20:38.660 --> 20:45.660
Even with the size and security of his channel, these factors were all things that Dan clearly wanted to take into account.

20:45.660 --> 20:51.660
When I think back to the reasons that we make coming out videos, one of the points I didn't touch on is to develop a character,

20:51.660 --> 20:54.660
and why wouldn't I say that on principle?

20:54.660 --> 20:58.660
Well it's because sexuality itself doesn't directly define character,

20:58.660 --> 21:02.660
but at the end of the day, if we acknowledge the label that comes with it as a social status,

21:02.660 --> 21:08.660
then a lot of implications through experiences do come along that will define people, that will affect them.

21:08.660 --> 21:10.660
Dan touches on these a lot in his video.

21:10.660 --> 21:17.660
This experience, coming from a childhood hearing the word gay meaninglessly thrown around as an insult at home and school,

21:17.660 --> 21:27.660
in music, on TV, to then realising I'm actually kinda gay, to then very specifically being attacked for it, was traumatic.

21:27.660 --> 21:35.660
The world was clearly telling me if I ever wanted to be accepted by anyone, or in my particular environment, survive,

21:35.660 --> 21:43.660
I couldn't be gay. I was afraid of it. Literally homophobic of myself.

21:43.660 --> 21:53.660
I'm talking Pavlov, Sunken Place, North Korea level mind alteration that made me terrified of and repulsed by this part of me.

21:53.660 --> 21:59.660
I think that's a really unique detail to his content, there's this lack of egoism to what he makes,

21:59.660 --> 22:04.660
and plenty of people have gone on diatribes about how we can all be happy and accept ourselves,

22:04.660 --> 22:08.660
but sometimes these speeches come across as very pandering,

22:08.660 --> 22:12.660
because they're done without the perspective of what the issues really are,

22:12.660 --> 22:18.660
and just telling someone that they can be happy, as glorious as it is, is only a part of many people's picture.

22:18.660 --> 22:26.660
Howell takes these issues head on, identifying them in a detailed fashion, but then expanding them in a way that relates to a lot of people.

22:26.660 --> 22:31.660
Now let me make it clear, this isn't the first time personal experiences have been touched on,

22:31.660 --> 22:36.660
there's a great video regarding coming out by Katzen, and fantastically creative in its own right,

22:36.660 --> 22:40.660
but equally I think the multifaceted narratives that Dan's video constructed,

22:40.660 --> 22:44.660
tied together by an interaction between actions and consequences, private and public,

22:44.660 --> 22:49.660
and the subsequent social messages that he actually promoted, really took the concept to a new level.

22:49.660 --> 22:53.660
The great thing about Dan's videos is that he never seems conceited with what he creates,

22:53.660 --> 22:57.660
it always feels like he's working on something new, even when he doesn't have to,

22:57.660 --> 23:00.660
and on a video with such a social statement, that's important.

23:00.660 --> 23:05.660
I think the fact that Dan took the effort when, on principle, the announcement could have carried it alone,

23:05.660 --> 23:08.660
is a real testament to who he is as a creator.

23:08.660 --> 23:11.660
As videos go, this was a tonal masterpiece.

23:12.660 --> 23:17.660
This tale was just some of the stuff relating to sexuality, we all have a whole sob story if we wanna tell it,

23:17.660 --> 23:24.660
but I just wanted to explain the journey of how I got to this point, and overcame the obstacles that tried to block this path.

23:24.660 --> 23:27.660
And now, I've arrived.

23:27.660 --> 23:31.660
So when it comes to how these videos created, he definitely got it right,

23:31.660 --> 23:37.660
but there's one more point that has to be acknowledged, which really pushes the video over the top in my opinion.

23:41.660 --> 23:54.660
The penultimate part of his video is concerned with labels,

23:54.660 --> 23:58.660
now initially I felt confused as to why he had inserted this part towards the end,

23:58.660 --> 24:01.660
after what had kinda felt like a moment of closure.

24:01.660 --> 24:07.660
However, he really did justify it with arguably the point that pulled this whole video together,

24:07.660 --> 24:10.660
and revealed the underlying message to me at least, judgement.

24:10.660 --> 24:15.660
Throughout the video, Howell makes multiple references to the sort of judgement that he was subjected to,

24:15.660 --> 24:21.660
on the basis of those labels, and circumstances that no one could ever truly really know about other than him.

24:21.660 --> 24:28.660
Judgement is inevitable in many ways, but it manifested into behaviour that ultimately led to a lot of personal struggles,

24:28.660 --> 24:30.660
whether that was the intent or not.

24:30.660 --> 24:35.660
And this leads him to his final section, fear, where he really manages to speak to everyone.

24:35.660 --> 24:39.660
In the past, people have had to come out with the hope of acceptance for who they are.

24:39.660 --> 24:42.660
This video changed that, it flipped it.

24:42.660 --> 24:45.660
It was a message of why you should accept people for who they are,

24:45.660 --> 24:50.660
and not ostracise or exclude them for elements of their identity that are beyond their control.

24:50.660 --> 24:56.660
Dan turns the narrative on his head and puts the responsibility much more squarely on other people.

24:56.660 --> 25:04.660
The story he tells is of a lad who strives for acceptance in a community that has given those behaviours labels with negative connotations

25:04.660 --> 25:08.660
due to the deviation from the social perspective of normality.

25:08.660 --> 25:14.660
Eventually, this comes in a weird circle with him realising that there is nothing really wrong with being different,

25:14.660 --> 25:21.660
both finding that difference and acceptance in multiple aspects of his life, his content included.

25:21.660 --> 25:25.660
As mentioned, Dan's content did really connect with who he was as a person,

25:25.660 --> 25:29.660
so a coming out video would certainly keep in line with this evolution,

25:29.660 --> 25:36.660
as it's likely that a lot of the struggles that he experienced and channeled due to his sexuality were embedded in the content that he made.

25:36.660 --> 25:39.660
There is so much controversy around this issue and others,

25:39.660 --> 25:45.660
but if we all just calm down, respect each other's experiences and try to just be nice, reasonable people,

25:45.660 --> 25:48.660
which is a lot to ask, let's be real, it's quite simple.

25:48.660 --> 25:52.660
If you want to use language to express your honest feelings and identity, that's great,

25:52.660 --> 25:55.660
and other people should respect what you say.

25:55.660 --> 26:00.660
Likewise, if you hate labels and you just want to be a formless blob, that's fine too, no one should force you.

26:00.660 --> 26:06.660
The only thing that isn't cool is telling other people what they should or should not identify as,

26:06.660 --> 26:09.660
because that ain't your problem or your business, bye.

26:09.660 --> 26:13.660
This video was not just an important video for a multitude of reasons,

26:13.660 --> 26:17.660
but it was an important continuation rather than a diversion from what he creates.

26:17.660 --> 26:24.660
With all the context around his identity in the previous years, it leads him to find a moment of strength in great vulnerability,

26:25.660 --> 26:30.660
and with that in mind, I think HAL really reinvigorated the coming out video in many ways.

26:30.660 --> 26:36.660
For too long, there is this constant concern that many people have that these types of videos will be commodified

26:36.660 --> 26:43.660
for the YouTube machine, given YouTube's own track record, and this video blasted any hashtag proud to be video out of the water.

26:43.660 --> 26:48.660
In the first part of my analysis, I set out basic reasons why someone might make a video,

26:48.660 --> 26:53.660
to make people aware, to clear up misconceptions, to help others who may be in a similar predicament,

26:53.660 --> 26:56.660
and to provide development to his own character.

26:56.660 --> 27:01.660
Dan covered all these, and more, and this is not to say that other videos aren't important in their own right.

27:01.660 --> 27:08.660
Less than a couple days later, Eugene Lee Yang came out in another video that was a strong statement of self expression,

27:08.660 --> 27:14.660
but I don't think I've watched a coming out video that just felt so right, and I don't know how to express it like that.

27:14.660 --> 27:20.660
It struck the balance between personal and universal, it allowed him to present new pieces of himself,

27:20.660 --> 27:24.660
while not necessarily binding his personality to his character.

27:24.660 --> 27:30.660
It was a cathartic moment that many have been anticipating, but even then, it defied expectations.

27:30.660 --> 27:35.660
It was a mutual experience for him and the audience, and I'm trying not to sound preachy.

27:35.660 --> 27:41.660
And of course, I know that's just my opinion, but I know that a lot of people feel the same,

27:41.660 --> 27:47.660
and that's equally important, when we watch figures online retelling their stories, when we invest ourselves in them,

27:47.660 --> 27:53.660
we want to be confident that what they're saying is the truth, because we may be encountering the same struggles that they went through,

27:53.660 --> 27:58.660
and we may be looking to explain it in a way that can help us understand ourselves.

27:58.660 --> 28:05.660
The fact that Howell took so much time to explain in detail these feelings and using them to convey messages was a real favour,

28:05.660 --> 28:10.660
he genuinely didn't have to, and I have little doubt that he has just helped a lot of people.

28:10.660 --> 28:13.660
I'm so glad I failed, for so many reasons.

28:13.660 --> 28:18.660
For the people in my life, for the future I would have wasted,

28:18.660 --> 28:28.660
the most important being that I thought I was trapped in a situation forever, when in reality, the entire world I lived in and my life changed completely.

28:28.660 --> 28:34.660
I thought it was hopeless, when in reality, there was so much to hope for, and that's it.

28:34.660 --> 28:37.660
Time changes everything.

28:37.660 --> 28:41.660
In the lives that we have, we can try anything we've dreamed of.

28:41.660 --> 28:46.660
I want anyone that's ever felt like this to realise you are never trapped.

28:46.660 --> 28:52.660
There is always hope. You just need to believe in yourself and get to the other side.

28:52.660 --> 28:55.660
For anyone who doesn't know, might be the odd couple of people, I'm gay,

28:55.660 --> 29:00.660
and I've never really been one to make a coming out video in such a way for multiple reasons,

29:00.660 --> 29:07.660
mainly because I'm a guy who comments on YouTube affairs, and I've always perceived it as feeling out of place with the rest of my content.

29:07.660 --> 29:09.660
It's never been who I am.

29:09.660 --> 29:13.660
I'm also someone who doesn't like to integrate too much of his personal life,

29:13.660 --> 29:16.660
but I still put the information out there for those who want to know,

29:16.660 --> 29:20.660
because at the end of the day, I really had trouble accepting myself,

29:20.660 --> 29:26.660
because my demeanour didn't exactly conform to the gay stereotypes that had been presented to me while I was growing up,

29:26.660 --> 29:31.660
and when I finally deciphered it at the ripe age of 18, I felt like I'd lost so much time,

29:31.660 --> 29:33.660
and I wouldn't wish that on anyone.

29:33.660 --> 29:37.660
That doesn't mean that I think everyone should just jump straight in the deep end,

29:37.660 --> 29:41.660
but I think that at a time when so many people were exploring their sexuality,

29:41.660 --> 29:45.660
I was just sat there like a lemming waiting to be attracted to women.

29:45.660 --> 29:47.660
I really could have used a few hints.

29:47.660 --> 29:53.660
You can't change the past, there's no point in being bitter about influences other than catharsis,

29:53.660 --> 29:55.660
but even then it'll wear you out.

29:55.660 --> 30:00.660
The best thing that we all can do is know the challenges, know what put us there,

30:00.660 --> 30:04.660
and provide the insight to help others traverse it on their own terms.

30:04.660 --> 30:07.660
Since starting my channel, and uploading videos of course,

30:07.660 --> 30:10.660
it's really neat to have people reach out to me in similar places,

30:10.660 --> 30:14.660
and saying that me talking about my experiences resonated with them,

30:14.660 --> 30:19.660
and how it helped them come to terms with various aspects of their life, sexuality included.

30:19.660 --> 30:23.660
It's never really an effect I considered until people started telling me.

30:23.660 --> 30:29.660
You always feel like your experiences are so isolated, but so often you're not alone.

30:29.660 --> 30:32.660
People's sexuality will always be their own story,

30:32.660 --> 30:35.660
and that's a story they are under no obligation to share.

30:35.660 --> 30:39.660
When someone decides to be open about it, it can make a real difference,

30:39.660 --> 30:43.660
and therefore both as someone who's been on the giving and receiving end of this dynamic,

30:43.660 --> 30:45.660
no pun intended you freaks,

30:45.660 --> 30:48.660
it gives me a greater appreciation for a video like Dan's.

30:48.660 --> 30:54.660
Throughout the years, since 2009, Dan has represented a quintessential YouTuber in many ways,

30:54.660 --> 30:59.660
making content with the sort of sincerity that subverts the mainstream entertainment genre,

30:59.660 --> 31:03.660
while still producing some great comedy, often underlying strong messages.

31:03.660 --> 31:06.660
With this video, none of that really changes.

31:06.660 --> 31:12.660
I mean sure, due to the seriousness of the topic, it's obviously marginally less laugh out loud comedic,

31:12.660 --> 31:16.660
but nothing will alienate his audiences that have come to know and love him.

31:16.660 --> 31:21.660
It builds on his character, and many of the relationships fans might have had with it,

31:21.660 --> 31:26.660
and to see such a mainstream person do this, it will instil a lot of confidence in people lacking it.

31:26.660 --> 31:31.660
At the same time, he's created a video that could have been a fairly casual upload,

31:31.660 --> 31:35.660
yet delivers something incredibly meaningful, adding a lot of new value

31:35.660 --> 31:40.660
to a long-standing bastion of a community that can sometimes seem completely lost.

31:40.660 --> 31:43.660
He'll have created a lot of new fans through this as well,

31:43.660 --> 31:45.660
because even if you're not wholly familiar with him,

31:45.660 --> 31:50.660
the fact that he touched on a lot of relatable experiences made it highly accessible.

31:50.660 --> 31:55.660
It's a great video, for multiple reasons, but it's an important one too,

31:55.660 --> 31:58.660
with a familiar, yet transcendent message.

31:58.660 --> 32:02.660
To anyone watching this that isn't out, it's okay. You're okay.

32:02.660 --> 32:07.660
You were born this way, it's right, and anyone that has a problem with it is wrong.

32:07.660 --> 32:10.660
Based on your circumstance, you might not feel ready to tell people yet,

32:10.660 --> 32:13.660
or that it's safe, and that's fine too.

32:13.660 --> 32:19.660
Just know that living your truth with pride is the way to be happy.

32:19.660 --> 32:25.660
You are valid, it gets so much better, and the future is clear.

32:25.660 --> 32:27.660
It's pretty queer.

32:27.660 --> 32:31.660
Acceptance, from people, for people.

32:31.660 --> 32:34.660
Unless they like pineapple on pizza and then they can get f***ed.

32:34.660 --> 32:39.660
I had to finish it on a joke, didn't I?

32:39.660 --> 32:41.660
Ruining everything, as always.

32:41.660 --> 32:45.660
Anyhow, I'd love to give a big shoutout to my editors.

32:45.660 --> 32:48.660
I'm sure they have once again done a fantastic job.

32:48.660 --> 32:51.660
I'm envisioning it right now, and I love it as much as ever.

32:51.660 --> 32:54.660
I want to give a big thanks to my Patreons.

32:54.660 --> 32:57.660
Fantastic, fantastic people.

32:57.660 --> 33:02.660
I need to give a special shoutout to some very special Patreons.

33:02.660 --> 33:04.660
A $50 Patreon.

33:04.660 --> 33:07.660
We've got the face of Team Rocket, thank you so much.

33:07.660 --> 33:10.660
Somehullerblue, you're a real veteran, mate.

33:10.660 --> 33:12.660
Jewelangel1, thank you.

33:12.660 --> 33:14.660
Again, lots of love.

33:14.660 --> 33:18.660
And Bowright, a new bloke, so fantastic.

33:18.660 --> 33:21.660
And then at the $100 tier, Adam Michael.

33:21.660 --> 33:25.660
Wow, that's just $100.

33:25.660 --> 33:28.660
Brandon Junk, thank you.

33:28.660 --> 33:29.660
Long-standing Patreon.

33:29.660 --> 33:32.660
I don't think we've even ever spoken yet, just incredible.

33:32.660 --> 33:35.660
These people have that sort of face, so thank you guys.

33:35.660 --> 33:38.660
And EveningSteal, another long-term supporter of the channel.

33:38.660 --> 33:42.660
They recently actually, it was the last couple of months, they upped their pledge.

33:42.660 --> 33:44.660
You know, I'm genuinely endeared by that.

33:44.660 --> 33:47.660
When someone does that, you know, going one step above

33:47.660 --> 33:50.660
feels like we're moving on up in the world, my friends.

33:50.660 --> 33:53.660
And hopefully that's what we'll be doing.

33:53.660 --> 33:58.660
Obviously, if you want to reach me, you can get in touch with me on Twitter, Facebook, and Discord.

33:58.660 --> 34:01.660
I'll be leaving links to those in the pinned comments.

34:01.660 --> 34:03.660
I do not have too much else to add.

34:03.660 --> 34:06.660
Just want to thank you guys for the support, as always.

34:06.660 --> 34:08.660
It just genuinely makes a difference.

34:08.660 --> 34:12.660
Hopefully, now I'm out of university, we'll be on an open road.

34:12.660 --> 34:16.660
So, until I'm driving down that open road, I guess I'm the right opinion,

34:16.660 --> 34:19.660
and I'll see you in the next one.

34:28.660 --> 34:37.660
Thanks for watching!
