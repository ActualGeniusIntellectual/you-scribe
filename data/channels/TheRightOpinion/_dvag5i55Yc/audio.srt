They have a 90 day no hassle return policy and 24-7 customer service, so if that's your jam, then I would certainly recommend them.

4
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,440
Let's get into the video.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,480
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the right opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

6
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,960
And for those well accustomed to this channel, you know that I have a habit of covering topics that typically pertain to the YouTube sphere.

7
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,000
I do this for a variety of reasons. It's consistent with my brand. You guys enjoy it.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,640
I have great personal investment in the subjects and the views aren't too shabby either.

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,440
All these factors aren't considered when taking on a new project, and as you can envision, my head runs a series of complex mathematical algorithms

10
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,840
to calculate the most suitable themes to cover in my upcoming content.

11
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:14,720
However, every now and then there is a disturbance in the matrix, the tro computer malfunctions, and a topic is chosen because I feel like it.

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,560
Yes, I know, shocking as it may be, I do possess the ability to experience feelings.

13
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,560
Today, this emotional intuition has led me to one of the most iconic talk show hosts of all time,

14
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,600
and perhaps the not so unfamiliar fate that befell them this abysmal year.

15
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,200
You see, as I've subtly alluded to just now, YouTubers have personas, myself included.

16
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,640
Although these personas will seldom completely mirror the individual behind them,

17
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:44,120
we tend to develop a more personal connection with them than we do with most celebrities because of the many personal elements that have been integrated.

18
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:51,320
YouTube intimacy has always been a specific selling point, and where we may separate the art and the artist in various branches of entertainment,

19
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,800
with content creators, the relationship seems a little more inextricable.

20
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,520
However, probably one of the most similar genres to that of YouTube is the American talk show host.

21
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,960
I will shut down Twitch. I will shut down YouTube gaming. I have that power.

22
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,880
For years, we have perceived them as an invasive species on the platform, and to be honest, I can't say I'm particularly enthusiastic about their presence.

23
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,920
However, their involvement makes a lot of sense, especially given how they brand themselves.

24
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,320
Hell, the overlap is so obvious now we even have a YouTuber who became a talk show host.

25
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,600
That's a video for another time. For those who are familiar with this brand of TV personality,

26
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:30,160
you'll know that in spite of the scripted sequences and the big name guests, there's a lot of weight in the actual host and the qualities they hold.

27
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:37,680
Whether it's the suave-suited, sadonic bite of Trevor Noah, the reasoned incision of Stephen Colbert, or the James Corden,

28
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,920
each holds their own appeal. However, few can lay claim to the degree of market dominance that one woman has commanded,

29
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,360
that woman being Oprah Winfrey.

30
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:54,760
This calls for a drum roll. Cue the drum roll. All right, open your boxes. Open your boxes. One, two, three.

31
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:05,480
You get a car! You get a car! You get a car! You get a car! You get a car! You get a car! You get a car! You get a car!

32
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,760
You get a car! Everybody gets a car!

33
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:16,000
Haha, get baited, punks. Though completely true, of course, the Oprah Winfrey show has been off-air for just shy of a decade now.

34
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:22,320
However, it was over 20 years ago in 1997 when an individual by the name of Ellen DeGeneres appeared on Oprah's show

35
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,400
to speak openly about her sexuality for the first time.

36
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,760
Why did you think it was necessary for you to come out? You know, you've read some of the mail, people say,

37
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,720
so if you're gonna, why not just let that be your business? Why was it necessary for you to come out, tell the public,

38
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,320
why was it necessary for the character to do so? Because it's okay.

39
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,160
At that point, Ellen was a star of the popular sitcom Ellen. Fitting name.

40
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,880
James was coming out was integrated into the plotline of that show as well, with the revelation occurring in a scene where

41
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,480
Oprah played Ellen's therapist. The episode that contained the sequence became one of the most viewed in the show's history,

42
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,640
attracting an audience of 42 million. However, in spite of this, reception was mixed from within the industry and political spectrum

43
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:09,840
alike, with some advertisers pulling slots, and pressure from family rights concern groups. How delightful.

44
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,840
Although Ellen was renewed for a fifth season, Disney owned ABC-ran parental advisory warnings before each episode,

45
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,680
which alongside other factors was attributed as engineering the show's decline in ratings and eventual cancellation,

46
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,240
stimulating debate over LGBT discrimination within the field.

47
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,240
What about this was adult content?

48
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:41,440
Depicting characters who are gay on television in physical acts, I believe, is adult content.

49
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,600
But how is that more adult content than heterosexual couples rolling around in bed, which they do?

50
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,320
Again, we're making a judgment about what our society is comfortable with and what they might not be comfortable with.

51
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,200
Aren't we then just enabling a prejudice in the audience?

52
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,200
We're not telling people necessarily not to watch it.

53
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,080
Ellen's TV career encountered a bit of a rough patch over the following years, with another attempt at a sitcom,

54
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:13,120
The Ellen Show, failing to find success. However, come 2003, the winds of change were finally blowing in the direction of our comedienne.

55
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,360
Firstly, with the release of the animated film Finding Nemo, where she played a memorable character by the name of Dory,

56
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,520
a fish with short-term memory loss. The distinctive voice performance won Ellen both praise and awards,

57
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,040
fortifying her status as an innovative and versatile entertainer.

58
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:34,000
However, the best was yet to come, because in September, the first transmission of a little program known as The Ellen DeGeneres Show was broadcast.

59
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,440
It's September 8th, this is our very, very first show, and you are my very first audience.

60
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:47,720
The Ellen DeGeneres Show, commonly shortened to Ellen, is a daytime talk series, hosted by none other than our well-acquainted friend Ellen DeGeneres.

61
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:53,200
Its philosophy is often portrayed as one of positivity, accented by a light-hearted tone,

62
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,200
with audience and celebrity guest involvement in a variety of games, pranks, jokes, and giveaways.

63
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:04,160
Since its inception just over 17 years ago, Ellen's show has steadily ascended the daytime TV ratings hierarchy,

64
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,840
often only being bested by the man Dr. Phil himself. The show has received 61 Daytime Emmy Awards,

65
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:17,600
spawned spin-off series such as Ellen Games of Games, and garnered the reputation as a space where one can turn themselves off from all the stress in the world.

66
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,080
An asset that becomes ever more valuable in times like these.

67
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,600
Nonetheless, it wouldn't be possible to convey that message if the host didn't encompass those same values,

68
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:34,520
and in Ellen, many found someone who is a beacon in that darkness, a doctrine of kindness represented by a person who had faced hardships to be where they are today,

69
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,000
but had come through and wanted to share that spirit with you.

70
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,960
I don't think you have to have a talk show to, uh, to be nice to people, to do what I'm doing.

71
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,200
Um, I just think that kindness is something that we should all have.

72
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,240
That's an innate quality that we have, and we need to, we need more of that out there.

73
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:01,560
Be kind to one another, a simple but powerful precept, and one that to many, Ellen appeared to live by herself.

74
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,640
However, in a time where many felt that kindness was more imperative than ever,

75
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:13,400
some began to claim that it had, in fact, deserted her, while others, well, asserted it was never even there in the first place.

76
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:22,520
What followed was a media propelled deluge of allegations that threatened to alter the perception of a beloved TV icon and everything that people thought she stood for.

77
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,080
Conversely, many jumped to her defense, stating that these character attacks were unwarranted,

78
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,200
that critics had imposed unfair standards, and that Ellen was still the person that she had always claimed to be.

79
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,680
Was this a person under attack, or a persona under the microscope?

80
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,400
Well, there's only one way of attempting to find out.

81
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:45,160
Ladies, gentlemen, folks, I suggest we begin to unravel this curious, curious case.

82
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,920
You see, what seems recent actually goes back a bit further than you may think.

83
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,160
So to fully understand what we're dealing with today, we're going to dust off the Tro Time Machine,

84
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:06,240
give it a spin, and gather some intel to grasp what laid the foundations for the coming charades.

85
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:14,760
I've been studying kindness for the past 17 years on this show, and I thought I could help with some research that, you know, like, I don't know, these are things that I've learned.

86
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:20,000
So consider me your professor. This is like Kindness 101, so pay attention. This is on the midterm.

87
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,520
The Ellen DeGeneres show has, in a way, established Ellen as an icon, unlike anything else she has created.

88
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,680
This is not to diminish her contributions to her career prior, we should acknowledge that these things are cumulative.

89
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,080
But when people think of Ellen, they think of this.

90
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:39,680
All right, what I want everyone in this room to do is just think kind thoughts.

91
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,720
Let's witness the power of kindness. Let's just think kind thoughts, everybody.

92
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:51,280
In a way, that is incredible, and the fact that so many people have that innate association is a testament to her skills as a performer.

93
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:57,760
Yet at the same time, given the marketing and framing of the program, a lot of viewers and even guests will receive the impression

94
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:04,800
the Ellen DeGeneres show is fundamentally what happens when you just take Ellen and stick her in front of the cameras for 40 minutes.

95
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,080
In a way, this is part of the charm. At the same time, this is an unrealistic interpretation.

96
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,240
Now, does this mean that Ellen isn't a kind or even good person? Not necessarily.

97
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,720
Ellen preaches those virtues on and off the air, but at the same time, it's clear that some had a mental image of Ellen,

98
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,920
which didn't match their subsequent experience, particularly when the cameras weren't rolling.

99
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:30,920
For gossip magazines, when someone expressed this sentiment publicly, it was indicative of the quote real Ellen,

100
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,040
and had been the predominant point against her for a fair few years.

101
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:39,360
In a way, I think that was the result of the fact that certain skeptics found Ellen's shtick too good to be true,

102
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,920
and with the online world, when someone appears so wholesome and perfect, some people feel disposed to depose them.

103
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:51,040
There were insider leaks and celebrities who had negative experiences with her, such as Kathy Griffin and Corinne Olympios,

104
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:57,520
with the film describing her as having quite a mean streak, and the latter referring to her on a podcast as very cold.

105
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,520
Would you say that's a great representation of yourself?

106
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:07,800
Um, that is a real me. It is definitely a real side of me, but there are many other sides.

107
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,080
Now, it's important to note that these were mostly fringe rumours at this point.

108
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,320
Fudes and unfavourable interactions are not unexpected in the industry.

109
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,800
Some outlets jumped on them because, as scoops, they are pretty interesting and challenge the universal outlook,

110
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,960
but most people didn't pay them much regard.

111
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:29,840
However, the fact that minor comments received this publicity was a sign that many were ready to have their expectations subverted.

112
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,800
Hell, a 2017 YouTube video from Cavos on this matter has amassed over 10 million views,

113
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,280
most of which came long before 2020.

114
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,280
Go sit in that Ellen jail over there right now.

115
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,280
I mean, look how pissed Ellen is. Look at her face.

116
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:00,280
I have never seen her act like this ever. It's fucking weird and all over her hat.

117
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,800
And yes, people are laughing, even Ellen's, you know, cracking a few laughs,

118
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:12,800
but this lady has been shamed in front of 13 million people on YouTube, a live audience and millions watching at home.

119
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,680
And for what?

120
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,280
Keep in mind that Cavos is a creator who primarily focuses on YouTube drama,

121
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,880
and although his upload received mixed feedback on release,

122
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,360
the traffic was indicative of the potential that such narratives harboured.

123
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:31,400
That video focused on a rather peculiar clip in which Ellen roasts an audience member for taking more than one item from her merch stand against displayed instructions.

124
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:50,600
Some of these more contentious clips have resurfaced over the years, attracting little slivers of public attention.

125
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:56,800
These excerpts may have appeared while intended in concept, but could translate into practice as mean-spirited or blinkered.

126
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:03,600
With that said, the video itself isn't anything extreme, and Cavos prefaces his critique with the acknowledgement that he actually likes Ellen.

127
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:12,000
This is how many felt about her at the time, and it seemed that a lot of the criticism would amount to individual experiences of Ellen which didn't turn out as anticipated.

128
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,960
This is the perspective that Ellen's wife Portia de Rossi echoed on an interview for Ellen's 2018 Netflix stand-up special Relatable,

129
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,240
stating that she's just a bit more complicated than she appears on the show, there's more range of emotion.

130
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:32,880
In the same article, a friend and director, Tegan Attaro, affirms this, stating that being trapped in the world of being asked to dance and expected to be nice,

131
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:40,000
it's real, and adding, I'm sure there's people who think she's kidding, or can't have a bad day, but she does, it's an interesting pickle she's in.

132
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,360
Ellen has bad days, and unfortunately, some people are gonna see that from time to time, especially people who've had limited experience with her.

133
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:54,000
Could such a point of view hold back public approval? Perhaps, if each claim was treated as an outlier rather than a pattern.

134
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,680
For a while, this was the case, mostly given the sparse and separate nature of previous negative testimonies, and the existence of conflicting positive ones.

135
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,320
It was particularly difficult to gather a consensus as to what Ellen's workplace was really like.

136
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,080
The most openly critical testimony was provided by an individual by the name of Surgical Strikes, or Dan Tobin,

137
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:19,040
which was posted in 2007 during the Writers Guild of America strike after Ellen questionably crossed the picket line to record her show.

138
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:28,640
Tobin shared anecdotes from when he worked for her on the mostly unsuccessful sitcom The Ellen Show, which depicted her as antagonistic and even derogatory towards her team.

139
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:38,320
He remarks how she openly expressed the desire to sack the head writer for the lack of quality content, while noting how he would later go on to create the legendary Arrested Development.

140
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,800
This post received ample amounts of media attention, but mostly faded when nobody else came forward to corroborate the claims.

141
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:51,520
Ellen would go on to indirectly respond to this account and other headlines spurred by anonymous testimonies in the 2018 interview,

142
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:58,160
where she dismissed them as an outright lie, emphasizing that workplace happiness is one of her utmost priorities.

143
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,080
With that in mind, what reason did we have to doubt her commitment?

144
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:10,560
Well, at the time of the interview, not much. I'm gonna save some of the other contents for later, but as it stood, one thing that was constantly harped on was the fact that Ellen was human.

145
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:19,440
In a way, I think many people knew that, yet even if we did, The Ellen DeGeneres Show had almost elevated the image of its host in a way that was asking for it to be knocked down.

146
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,520
However, the only way this was going to happen is if a consistent stream of people who had background with DeGeneres were to come forward,

147
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:35,200
and for the longest time, that just didn't look like it was going to happen. Yet, here we are today, which probably means one thing, it did.

148
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:48,560
The Ellen DeGeneres Show

149
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:59,600
For the most part, Ellen's 2019 went off without a hitch, but as the new decade beckoned, she found herself in a bit of hot water after her appearance at a baseball game with former US President George W. Bush,

150
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:06,760
where they seem to be sharing some exquisite banter. Some online didn't welcome this interaction, given Bush's rather notorious legacy,

151
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:13,200
which included the now highly contested invasion of Iraq. Ellen responded to this by appealing to her philosophy of kindness,

152
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:20,000
stating that this principle doesn't just extend to people who agree with her, this was meant with support from many celebrities in her comment section,

153
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,880
and also inspired a monologue on a subsequent episode.

154
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,800
But just because I don't agree with someone on everything doesn't mean that I'm not going to be friends with them. When I say be kind to one another,

155
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,960
I don't mean only the people that think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone. Doesn't matter.

156
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:43,120
Earlier in the year, she had received some mild criticism after hosting the comedian Kevin Hart. He had stood down from hosting the Oscars following the resurfacing of some older,

157
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,520
rather inappropriate, homophobic content. Now, personally, if he's grown from that situation, then I don't think it should be held against him,

158
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:55,160
and I do genuinely think that it's sad that he had to relinquish such a fantastic opportunity. At the same time,

159
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:02,200
Ellen's narrative that the upset or outrage was merely a case of malicious internet trolls may strike some as a little offbeat.

160
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:10,720
There are so many haters out there. Whatever's going on in the internet, don't pay attention to them. That's a small group of people being very, very loud.

161
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:17,400
We are a huge group of people who love you and want to see you host the Oscars. You know, the trolls are, and they do it,

162
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:25,960
and who knows who this person is or people who cares, and you can't let them destroy you, and they can't destroy you because you have too much talent.

163
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:32,280
No one can do that, and for them to stop you from your dream, from what you wanted to do and what you have a right to do,

164
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,120
what you should be doing, it's why they haven't found another host.

165
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:44,000
Now, this may not seem like the most relevant incident to today's discourse, and anyone familiar with Ellen will know that her friendship with Bush and Hart pre-existed these situations.

166
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,720
However, it was an important reminder of the degree that our TV host Goodwill incorporated. Whether it was too far for some people was unimportant.

167
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:59,400
It wouldn't be Ellen if it was anything else, and you know what? Come 2020, we could all use a little bit of kindness towards one another.

168
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:06,560
With the bleak socio-political landscape draining the very fibre of our being, it was never a better time for Ellen's teachings to shine through.

169
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:13,000
However, rather than being the saving grace in a year full of letdowns, she became a key subject of the public's own disillusion.

170
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:20,240
Let's move to March then, and if you recall, I mentioned that to garner publicity, claims would need to be organised in a way that outlines a pattern of behaviour,

171
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:27,280
rather than just individual experiences. It was hard to see exactly how that would happen, but gold was struck when comedian Kevin T. Porter

172
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,880
decided to raise some money for charity through the rather unorthodox method of donating for every story shared about Ellen's cruelty.

173
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,560
The tweet announcing this quickly received hundreds, and eventually thousands of replies covering Ellen's alleged shenanigans.

174
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:46,560
These ranged from former fans whose opinion of Ellen had been spoiled following encounters with the TV personality, to eyewitness accounts of Ellen

175
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:51,240
transforming into a dragon, though unfortunately, there isn't any evidence to support that one.

176
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:58,520
However, there were a few select claims that stood out, and became rather popular on their own terms, one of which regarding Ellen's former head writer,

177
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:05,320
Karen Kilgoreth. The tweet here asserted that during the 2007 writers' strike, Kilgoreth had refused to cross the picket line,

178
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,240
and was subsequently dismissed from her role, with Ellen never speaking to her again.

179
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,960
Kilgoreth had actually made a statement expressing empathy for DeGeneres at the time for crossing the picket line,

180
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:22,360
so this would be a pretty damning story if true, and this is at least somewhat supported by Kilgoreth's own retelling of the instance.

181
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:28,040
You're in a position now where the show has decided to cross the picket line, and you said no.

182
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:36,200
Well, I didn't say anything. I had to go on strike. So we kind of all said goodbye, like, oh, this sucks. This is so weird. See you later.

183
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:42,200
And, you know, when I was talking to, like, my EPs were like, we'll call you, and it was all that kind of stuff.

184
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:51,320
And I don't think anybody was prepared for the kind of political action that was about to take place. Like, no one knew what was going on.

185
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,680
What happened?

186
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:58,440
Well, the Writers Guild found out that they were, our show was going to cross the picket line, and they went fucking berserk.

187
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:06,120
They were just like, they wanted to, like, they made sure that I was always at the center of the, like, at the strike gate.

188
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:12,440
It was really crazy. We just kind of became the eye of the storm in this weird way of, like, the show that's doing the worst thing.

189
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,560
Because there were other...

190
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,760
But you weren't working.

191
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:20,760
No, we were striking. We showed up every day. Like, that was the crazy part, is our show was mad at us,

192
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,840
because the Guild was mad at them.

193
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,200
What happened after that? With your relationship with her?

194
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:33,240
Oh, yeah, it was bad. So we got her to stay out the first day. So Karen Anderson and I both were talking to her, and we were just like, please trust us.

195
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,000
This is way worse than you think it is.

196
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,800
Right.

197
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:42,840
And so she stayed out the first day. She told them I'm not going to cross the picket line, and then that's when they swarmed her.

198
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,640
I mean, I don't actually...

199
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,840
The affiliates?

200
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,400
No, no, no.

201
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:45,960
WGA?

202
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,600
The, no, no, no. The production company.

203
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,240
Right, right.

204
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:55,800
The people that ran the show. I'm sure her people, like, all the bigwigs went in and were just like, uh, no, you're doing the show.

205
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:01,560
So she wasn't comfortable with it, but they basically convinced her, like, this is what you have to do.

206
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:08,200
And then that's kind of when the whole, like, we are union zealots story started getting floated.

207
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,280
And the next time after that, that I talked to her...

208
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,000
Who, your writers?

209
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,520
Yeah, like, all of us striking, which we had no fucking choice.

210
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:20,120
She was definitely guilted of, like, there's all these people that have jobs. You can't, you can't stop their paycheck.

211
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,520
Right.

212
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,280
You know, they put her in that weird position.

213
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:30,520
I think that the part that fell apart the worst was just that interpersonal connection of, like, nobody needed to be demonized.

214
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,440
Nobody needed to be, like, she's the one that's doing all this stuff.

215
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:41,800
At one point, there was a story in the National Enquirer that I was in about how Ellen had crossed the picket line.

216
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,080
There was, like, a picture of me on the strike line in the National Enquirer.

217
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,360
It was the weirdest thing.

218
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,840
And I never talked to anybody from the National Enquirer.

219
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,120
That's not a thing you do.

220
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:55,400
When you work on a show, you sign papers, confidentiality, and there was no story to tell.

221
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,120
We were on strike.

222
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,200
It was just, it was what it was.

223
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,840
And they, the people, the EPs and stuff found out and they thought I went to the press.

224
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,000
So it was things like that where it's like, you've known me for five years and you think,

225
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,320
you think I would go to the fucking National Enquirer to talk about this ridiculous situation.

226
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,240
It was all that kind of stuff.

227
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,720
By the time it was over, everyone was so estranged and everyone was so angry.

228
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,720
And those people had to work for four months on a talk show with no writers.

229
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,280
Like, they must have been stressed out of their minds.

230
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,880
I mean, it wasn't good.

231
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,560
I honestly felt like at that time, it was almost like an act of God.

232
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,160
It was like, I've been here for five years.

233
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,680
I've given my all.

234
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,360
This really weird thing has happened that would never happen in a million years.

235
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,280
It's just like this strange thing.

236
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:38,760
I'm out.

237
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,520
This is my chance to go.

238
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:46,520
And that's, and I just kind of wash my hands of it because it was just too, it was really painful.

239
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,600
Now, does this excuse Ellen's actions?

240
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,240
Not at all.

241
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,640
It's a situation where she could have afforded to think for herself, and she didn't by the sound of it.

242
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,760
The fact that someone sees contact with another individual altogether on the basis of a very difficult decision

243
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,640
does make me wonder where her priorities lie, but it's not an indictment of character that we would need.

244
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,960
However, we have plenty more stories to examine.

245
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,360
Some of these characterize her as excruciatingly petty, complaining over trivialities

246
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,840
and going as far to encourage the redundancy of those who had caused her inconveniences.

247
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:20,520
Others depict her as cold, distant, and even cruel, with statements from multiple people claiming to be,

248
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:26,280
or at least no employees on the show, with the common theme being that many were discouraged from even conversing with her,

249
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,560
with Ellen abiding by this principle pretty strictly as well.

250
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:35,240
The stories just kept piling up, many of which not the most positive, not that you'd expect it in a thread constructed

251
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,640
on the premise of sharing your worst Ellen experiences.

252
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:44,040
Additionally, the fact that exposing bad stories aids the support of a good cause may lead some to present circumstances

253
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,360
in a more negative light than they actually occurred.

254
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,520
Nonetheless, a good portion of these stories were hard to write off, some came with receipts,

255
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,920
and others came from seemingly credible sources.

256
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:59,960
However, they were all united by one thing, that the Ellen DeGeneres trademarked kindness was not as all-inclusive as proclaimed.

257
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:05,960
In fact, to many, it appeared to be a source of personal profit, a facade that was dropped as soon as there was nothing at stake.

258
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:12,040
However, as most of these tales hinged on third-party or anecdotal evidence, very little could prospectively come from it.

259
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:17,400
A bunch of people gossiping on Twitter isn't really enough to topple an established TV personality alone.

260
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:23,080
Nonetheless, social media can be an excellent gauge of how much meat is on the bone for a ravenous news outlet,

261
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,720
and I'm sure many became excited at the possibility of a headline which revealed the undermining of

262
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,920
personally promoted values by an otherwise revered public figure.

263
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:37,480
Even if she didn't notice this, Ellen's producers should have recognised the warning signs, and trod carefully on the eggshells before them.

264
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:43,480
With the incoming threat of COVID-19, the standards and conduct of all involved would be put to the test more than ever.

265
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,080
This was a time where kindness and care to those around you was desperately needed,

266
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,240
perhaps even to an unprecedented degree in the Ellen DeGeneres' show's lifespan,

267
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,280
and if they put a single foot wrong, they could easily be subject to some very sharp scrutiny,

268
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:02,600
which could permanently damage the image of a show that they love so much, and their precious, precious host.

269
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,600
The truth is that, if Ellen couldn't afford the currency of kindness to those around her,

270
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,560
then it wasn't a price that anyone else was prepared to pay.

271
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,280
Jesus, where the hell am I?

272
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:37,720
At the end of the previous part, I emphasised the significance of this viral threat.

273
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:43,560
It had already spawned a few articles, and sent a lot of previously unsuspecting eyes onto our daytime sweetheart.

274
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,240
As the pandemic loomed, and we were all advised to stay the hell away from each other,

275
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,880
there were a lot of question marks over the entertainment industry, and what this meant for shows like Ellen,

276
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:57,640
which relied on the personal interaction with a live audience, as well as all the employees whose jobs may be on the line.

277
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,760
At the same time, this concern went beyond the industry, it was likely felt by many people who watched Ellen,

278
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,440
and looked to her for guidance.

279
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,040
It was an emotional time for many, and Ellen needed to be sensitive to that.

280
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,840
How would she deal with this age of uncertainty?

281
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:21,000
Ellen DeGeneres-"I've always wanted to have this show as a distraction, as a break from whatever's going on out there that may be unpleasant,

282
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,560
so if you're feeling down, I want to lift you up. If you're feeling trapped, I want to set you free.

283
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,000
If you feel like you're going in the wrong direction, I want you to back that thing up."

284
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,760
A reassuring clip from home. The quintessential Ellen. What could possibly go wrong?

285
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:42,840
Ellen DeGeneres-"One thing that I've learned from being in quarantine is that people, this is like being in jail, is what it is.

286
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:50,120
It's mostly because I've been wearing the same clothes for 10 days, and everyone in here is gay. The jokes that I have."

287
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,880
Well, it seems the writers have gone on strike again, because that joke kinda sucked,

288
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:01,480
and it didn't go down particularly well with viewers either, with many tweeting out their dismay at various aspects of the joke.

289
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:08,280
Now, there are many angles you can gird it from, however, I think, once again, it just makes Ellen seem a bit out of touch with the state of the world.

290
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:14,600
The analogy doesn't really make much sense on concept, and it's shortcoming to only intensified by the focus on Ellen's woes,

291
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,920
which don't draw the most personal sympathy.

292
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,280
Ellen DeGeneres-"You know what movie wouldn't have worked during the quarantine? Home Alone."

293
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,480
You're killing it today, Ellen.

294
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:33,160
Now, with that said, it's a bad joke. It happens. At a time like this, it seems excessive to be angry.

295
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:38,600
Who knows the stress that Ellen or her staff may be under that clouded their judgement on the delivery of such a gag.

296
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,560
She would have to do a little worse than that to come under fire, wouldn't she?

297
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:48,520
Well, a week later, it was reported that many crew members of the Ellen DeGeneres show were frustrated at their treatment following the state of crisis.

298
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:55,000
As leaked by two anonymous sources, they'd been given little to no communication, and shown no concern by the show's executives.

299
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,640
Further to this, many were frustrated that the show had hired an outside, non-union tech company to record her home broadcast.

300
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:08,360
When employees did finally receive a response from producers over two weeks later, they were informed that their pay would be reduced by 60%,

301
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,240
to an amount that would be hardly sufficient for many workers.

302
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:19,080
Much of the workforce probably felt their future was up in the air, and the alleged ambiguous messaging from leadership likely didn't assuage these anxieties.

303
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,560
To wait for such difficult news can hardly be fair, and many were quick to point this out.

304
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:31,080
Provided this is true, can this be directly attributed to Ellen? Not entirely. She can't be expected to keep in touch with everyone who is working for her,

305
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:37,320
and I think that a majority of people can understand that. However, the problem that once more rears its ugly head is that contradiction.

306
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,280
The people who've given their all to keep a show running deserve to be kept in the loop above anyone else,

307
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:49,800
and whether that's Ellen's direct responsibility or not, people don't want to see her as being in a system that is antithetical to what she advocates for.

308
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:57,640
With this story, a new narrative began to emerge, one that didn't just accuse Ellen of hypocrisy on the basis of her principles, but of a greater double standard.

309
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:03,400
When dealing with fellow celebrities, Ellen made the most heartfelt appeals to the qualities of sympathy and decency.

310
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:10,360
After all, they are human like the rest of us. However, these standards appeared to be neglected when dealing with anyone outside the celebrity clique.

311
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:17,960
Some felt this way following the George W. Bush controversy, that there had always been this separate class of elite above the consequences of their own actions,

312
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:26,120
and that Ellen had since joined them. The contrast of a multi-millionaire in their mansion grumbling about lockdown while many employees' livelihoods were in jeopardy

313
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:31,400
was not a flattering portrait, and only served to highlight the us-and-them contrast.

314
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:40,440
Ellen- I wanted to start doing my new show as soon as possible, because it's really for people who are stuck at home, and especially my staff and crew,

315
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:46,760
I love them, I miss them, and the best thing I can do to support them is to keep the show on the air, so here we are.

316
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:54,840
However, this still wasn't the whole story, as clips began to surface which even threw the idea of Ellen's preferential treatment of celebrities into contention.

317
00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:02,680
These could be quotes from people reflecting on their experience, such as Nikki's tutorials, who decide to address the show's hospitality on a Dutch talk show.

318
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:43,320
It seems there's even a hierarchy within the industry, and despite being applauded on air, her treatment elsewhere seemed less than stellar,

319
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,960
but that's just an account. What about direct clips? Well, there were those as well.

320
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,160
It's good to see you, happy belated birthday. When was your birthday?

321
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,680
It was October 4th.

322
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,400
October 4th.

323
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,880
This is Dakota Johnson, she is an actress, model, and friend of Ellen.

324
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:05,400
At the start of the interview, DeGeneres decides to jokingly take a jab at the fact that Johnson hadn't invited our gracious host to a birthday party.

325
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,720
However, there was a small hitch with that.

326
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,960
Actually, no, that's not the truth. Ellen, you were invited.

327
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:19,800
Last time I was on the show, last year, you gave me a bunch of s*** about not inviting you, but I didn't even know you wanted to be invited.

328
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,360
But I did invite you and you didn't come, so...

329
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,640
This time you invited me?

330
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,040
Yeah.

331
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,760
Are you sure?

332
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,400
Yeah.

333
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,000
How do you know? I don't think so.

334
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,960
Ask everybody.

335
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,680
Ask Jonathan, your producer.

336
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,880
Who said you were?

337
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,800
I was invited? Why didn't I go?

338
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,240
I don't know.

339
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,480
Was it?

340
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:39,800
Was it?

341
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,880
Oh, yeah, I had that thing.

342
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:49,240
In fact, at the time of Dakota's due, Ellen was occupied at a little baseball match with former president George W.

343
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:49,640
Bush.

344
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,640
Now, this exchange appeared to be in good humor.

345
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:58,200
However, the circumstances surrounding it prompted many to return to it, especially relevance to how disconnected Ellen is portrayed to be.

346
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:05,400
Other clips were even more incriminating, such as a now rather infamous scene with Mariah Carey, where to ascertain whether she's pregnant with a child,

347
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:10,920
Ellen decides to offer the singer an alcoholic beverage, something that anyone expecting a child would wish to avoid.

348
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:17,640
I'll also add for further context that Carey suffered a miscarriage following this interview, which really does not age it well at all.

349
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:24,440
And then the other thing is that people are saying that, uh, that you're pregnant.

350
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,320
There's rumors.

351
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,280
Don't discuss that.

352
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,720
Um, all right.

353
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,360
Well, you don't have to.

354
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,080
No, that's okay.

355
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,120
No, honestly, let's just toast with champagne and decide.

356
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:39,000
It's just fattening.

357
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,440
No, let's toast to you not being pregnant.

358
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,320
If you're not pregnant.

359
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,760
Oh, my goodness.

360
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,640
I can't believe that.

361
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,200
How about to the future for both of our futures?

362
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,720
Who knows what they hold?

363
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,200
Who knows?

364
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,560
All right, go ahead.

365
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,440
Okay, cheers.

366
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:00,920
Cheers.

367
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,280
It's too early for me.

368
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,320
I only drink it after 3 p.m.

369
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:05,560
Yeah.

370
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,800
As a concept for a lowbrow gag, it may have been mildly amusing, and at first I actually thought it was far too personal to not be staged.

371
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:25,400
However, Carey would later go on to say that the interrogation made her rather uncomfortable, and when you take this into account,

372
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,480
it's hard to look upon Ellen favorably.

373
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:34,840
Even if this wasn't her idea, she should have recognized and respected the discretion of her guest, and not fallen foul to such tabloid treachery.

374
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,600
I have my own dog.

375
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,920
Actually, she's pregnant, too.

376
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,800
I have two dogs.

377
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,160
Well, her master isn't.

378
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,600
Her master is.

379
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,320
Well, let me take some of the vodka next to me.

380
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,160
Why aren't you answering?

381
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:52,120
Ellen did that to me and tried to put me on the spot with some alcohol.

382
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,400
Okay, I'm not trying to put you on the spot.

383
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,760
It's nice if you are.

384
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:04,920
As these clips began to be collated outside the other documented claims, some began to search for an explanation for such conduct.

385
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,720
Was she out of touch or out of care?

386
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,480
Well, with more allegations to come, let's talk about it.

387
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:25,560
With the gradually mounting agglomeration of content, there was little doubt that something here was not quite right.

388
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:31,640
However, at the same time, there was a divergence in the theories that many adopted when attempting to assess Ellen's actions.

389
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:38,120
On one hand, some believe that much of this illustrated a celebrity who had simply forgotten what it was like to live in the real world,

390
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,800
and thus had become insensitive to the needs of many of those she claimed to care about.

391
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,960
To be honest, many of the rich and famous likely suffer from a lack of relatability.

392
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,120
However, their careers don't rely on connecting to an audience in the same way that Ellen's does.

393
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,480
Are you fans of the show?

394
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:51,920
Correct?

395
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,120
Yeah.

396
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,640
And you watch the show regularly.

397
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,080
Great.

398
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:10,200
One of those who subscribed to this school of thought was a former producer from the Ellen DeGeneres show.

399
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:17,160
Speaking anonymously in an article published in the New York Post, they recounted the time Ellen couldn't read a text after losing her glasses,

400
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:23,400
and decided that the reasonable response would be to phone Steve Jobs up and inform him that the iPhone should have a bigger font.

401
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:30,120
They say that's Ellen, and that she's not some demon, just a person who's been living in a privileged bubble for way too long.

402
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:37,640
This doesn't seem like an absurd point of view, and would perhaps explain some of the supposed rather petty behaviours as claimed by others.

403
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:44,440
In focusing on her role as a host, Ellen may have been isolated from many that she works with, either by her own decision,

404
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,360
or through corporate design, something that I'll probably talk about in due course.

405
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:54,920
Some who had worked with Ellen previously stating they had an overall positive experience, such as the former head writer Karen Kilgoriff,

406
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,640
appeared to have their relationship cut short pretty abruptly when a conflict of interest arose.

407
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:05,960
In Karen's interest, she was clearly hesitant to characterise Ellen as the source of this falling out, especially with the attested corporate meddling.

408
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:11,400
However, others would not be as charitable, and have a more damning verdict on our celebutant chum.

409
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:18,200
Where some may stop short of characterising our leading lady as malicious, others would venture with far less trepidation,

410
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,600
particularly with some of the more incriminating testimonies and clips on display.

411
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:28,680
Karen Kilgoriff-"And then you had a very tough time. You couldn't get a job? What was that like?"

412
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:36,440
Karen Kilgoriff-"Not only couldn't get a job, couldn't get someone on a phone. I mean, they're literally, you know, the show was cancelled, and no one called me.

413
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:46,360
It was just, I found out my assistant read it in the paper. And, you know, I felt sorry for myself. I felt like this isn't fair.

414
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:53,960
I thought people liked me, and why did this change anything? And I still am the same person, and you know, everything felt horrible to me."

415
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:59,320
Ellen is a TV veteran, and someone who has had more than ample experience with the worst of the industry.

416
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:04,920
However, although that makes her ascension of the hierarchy highly respectable, it also makes the selective application,

417
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,680
and even outright neglect of certain responsibilities, harder to defend.

418
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:13,000
With some personages, you can use ignorance as a way to explain certain blunders.

419
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,640
Even if you personally believe they have a duty to be aware of the consequences their actions have, it may make sense they lose sight of this.

420
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:26,520
With Ellen, simply put, it seemed much harder to believe, with many coming to the conclusion that she must have been aware of these injustices,

421
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,000
but had made the conscious decision to not care.

422
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,440
Some would go further than this, though, to say that she may even take pleasure in the subjugation of those around her,

423
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,960
partaking in excessively cruel and sadistic behaviour.

424
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:43,640
This falls in line with many of the more unforgiving stories regarding her conduct, and is not to be discounted either.

425
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:50,200
Another person who would come out to support this in the month following was a bodyguard who escorted Ellen at the 2014 Academy Awards.

426
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,960
He stated that although his experience with Ellen's wife, Portia, was rather positive,

427
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,040
this went downhill quickly when he met Ellen, who barely even made eye contact with him,

428
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,960
and radiated this aura of frigidity that bothered the chaperone in question.

429
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:09,000
He summarises his thoughts by saying that it's kind of demeaning in the way that she treats people other than those who are in her circle.

430
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:15,080
Now, both of these aforementioned positions have their advocates, and cases which seem to argue against,

431
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:19,320
even people who claim that a lot of what was being said was completely fabricated.

432
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:25,560
However, this criticism was not relenting, with many more people jumping in to discuss their brushes with the embattled icon.

433
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,240
Yet, in spite of this, all remained mostly quiet on Ellen's social medias.

434
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:35,160
Addressing drama is normally not a positive process, whether it's the right thing to do or not, so she kept pushing on,

435
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,840
but insider reports kept spilling that these allegations had affected her,

436
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,920
and it was hard to deny that she must be somewhat aware of what was being said.

437
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:51,160
Now, generally, the rule for a lot of public figures is to avoid punching down onto claims that may not necessarily have the substantiation to merit a response.

438
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:56,280
However, with leaks and rumours reaching fever pitch, it felt like the programme was at breaking point.

439
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:05,080
Rumourings were being constantly released to the press, who promoted it to the awaiting public in a vicious cycle that was gradually eroding away at the show and its host's stature.

440
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:11,640
At the start of July, the word began to spread that the Ellen DeGeneres show may be cancelled altogether because of the imputations,

441
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:16,600
and although the production company behind Ellen dismissed this as speculation, unsurprisingly so,

442
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:21,960
with what happened in the coming weeks, they may have wished they had, because on Thursday the 16th of July,

443
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:28,200
a damning dossier was published, which called out the toxic workplace environment behind the award-winning production.

444
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:36,600
It outlined unfair dismissals, discrimination, favouritism, and neglect of responsibilities typically expected of a show with such moral grounding.

445
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:42,280
Yes, one current and ten former employees painted the workplace culture as one ruled by fear,

446
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:52,600
with most of the blame being placed at the door of the producers, who had distanced DeGeneres and validated an environment that marginalised vulnerable individuals who needed support above anything else.

447
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:58,040
In some ways, a lot of what was detailed wasn't any more incriminating than previous testimonies published,

448
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:05,000
and this was much less focused on Ellen, but for some reason, this article cut deeper, maybe it was the cumulative batch alongside other content,

449
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,400
maybe it was the socially charged narratives that had become ever more relevant in recent months,

450
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:17,960
but for me, once more, it was the organisation of a slew of stirring stories, posted in a credible, well, moderately credible news output.

451
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:23,560
In the article, the executive producers, who are the subject of a lot of the criticism, express shock at the allegations,

452
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:29,640
pledging their commitment to a safe and friendly workspace for all, they seek to accept full culpability for the misconduct listed,

453
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:35,480
attempting to take attention away from Ellen. In many ways, this wasn't her story, but once more, at the start of the article,

454
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:42,600
there was this emphasis on Ellen's narrative of being kind, effectively being used to contrast with the coming content.

455
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:49,800
This wasn't just any workplace, this was Ellen's workplace, and if she was as kind as she was perceived, silence was no longer an option,

456
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:55,160
yet speaking out was a costly obligation all the same. Allow me to explain.

457
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:13,640
Let's pull it back to Ellen as a person, and Ellen as a show. In many ways, they are separate entities, but the fact that the latter is built on the former

458
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:19,080
means that no matter what the producers asserted, this was as much Ellen's problem as it was anyone else's.

459
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:26,440
As one of the staff members said, if she wants to have her own show and have her name on the show title, she needs to be more involved to see what's going on.

460
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:33,000
One of the greatest problems with this industry is that there's often this separation between individual hosts and the productions behind them.

461
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:40,680
That seems easy to forget as an audience member, but it is understandable when the host has a more passive role such as in certain reality programs,

462
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:50,440
or televised talent contests, and even then, in many ways, as an anchor to the experience, a presenter can't expect to be focused on controlling every aspect behind the scenes.

463
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:56,920
However, this was reaching a point where Ellen's neutrality would be seen as a tasked endorsement of an undesirable status quo.

464
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:02,240
The allegations were well founded, and so she needed to say something. Before she could say anything, though,

465
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:08,200
Warner Bros stepped in to launch their own exhaustive internal investigation, which would determine the source of the problem.

466
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:15,080
On July 27th, Variety reported that a memo had been sent out to staff members the week before, announcing the upcoming audit,

467
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:19,400
with the consultation of a third-party organization and an employee relations group.

468
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,160
Interviews were held, and circumstances were assessed, and three days after the initial story was published,

469
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,000
Warner Bros released a statement on the findings of their assessment, revealing quote,

470
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,080
deficiencies in the workplace environment, while also signifying that changes would be made.

471
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:38,480
This was a statement made both on behalf of the company and DeGeneres, which probably wasn't the best call,

472
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:44,440
but it seems that Ellen had distributed her own separate statement to the staff, where she communicated remorse for her failure

473
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:50,960
to stay conscious to oversights and shortcomings, vowing to make sure that a repeat of such antics would be avoided at all costs.

474
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,000
This statement was once more picked up by the press, who framed it as Ellen finally breaking her silence.

475
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:03,000
However, it was mostly an internal acknowledgement of failings only provoked by the report prior, and doesn't really mention much else.

476
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,160
Not that you'd expect it to, but it's hardly what some online represented it as.

477
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:13,960
Nonetheless, Ellen's statement was enough to begin a strange chain reaction that would take this ongoing controversy to new heights.

478
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:18,120
You see, although the promise of a more secure work environment may have appeased some employees,

479
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:25,000
those not directly affected appeared reluctant to accept her apology, likely because many felt that her angle was mostly adopted

480
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,240
for the sake of damage control, rather than actual regrets. As a response to the specific accusations levelled against her,

481
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:36,480
many felt this merely added further weight to the belief that she was just another self-interested social vulture,

482
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,800
and this time, it wasn't just the internet revel who were paying attention.

483
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,360
In fact, Ellen's statement attracted the eyes of some pretty notable figures.

484
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:48,840
One of those who left his input very shortly after the coverage by journalists was the esteemed voice actor Brad Garrett,

485
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:54,000
who had appeared on Ellen's show during the 2000s. However, it appears that any camaraderie had since faded,

486
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,000
as he laid into the talk show host pretty harshly, commenting in a now-deleted tweet that it was

487
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,800
common knowledge that Ellen had mistreated her staff, while also claiming to know a few personally.

488
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:09,960
This was then reported on by websites, one article prompting a reply from Back to the Future star Leah Thompson,

489
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,720
appearing to affirm Garrett's postulations with her best Yoda impression.

490
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:18,120
Around the same time, Australian radio host Neil Breen, no, not that Neil Breen,

491
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:22,200
recollected the time he had worked as a producer on a show that interviewed Ellen,

492
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:27,720
the numerous restrictions that the production team had imposed on them, and the subsequent atmosphere that yielded.

493
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:34,280
Well, when Ellen, the generous came to Australia to do her show in 2013, I was the executive producer of the Today Show.

494
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,320
So we partnered with them that she was brought out here by Swiss,

495
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:43,480
the vitamin company who was sponsoring the whole thing, and originally she was going to co-host the Today Show.

496
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,520
Then she was going to do this, this was going to do and the whole thing got watered down to Ellen.

497
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,600
The generous would do a sit down interview, right?

498
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:57,680
We took the whole Today Show to Melbourne at our expense, but she would do a sit down interview with Richard Wilkins.

499
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:03,480
We walk in and then the Ellen Show producer, there was a lot of them, there was a lot of people there.

500
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:08,880
Anyway, the producers called us aside and said, okay, this is how it's going to work here this morning.

501
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:16,880
Ellen's going to arrive at, you know, 10.15 and she'll be sitting in this chair here and Richard, you'll be sitting in this chair here.

502
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,720
Now, Neil, no one's to talk to Ellen.

503
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:26,240
So you don't talk to her, you don't approach her, you don't look at her, she'll come in, she'll sit down, she'll talk to Richard,

504
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,960
then Ellen will leave and we'll give you the thing.

505
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,680
And I sort of said, are you fair dinkum?

506
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,640
Oh, I can't look at her.

507
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,600
I found the whole thing bizarre.

508
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,880
Anyway, I've got to tell you, I'm not blaming Ellen because I didn't get to talk to her because I wasn't allowed to.

509
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,680
So I don't know whether she's a nice person or not, I wouldn't have a clue.

510
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:50,880
But I can tell you, the people who worked with her walked on eggshells the whole time and the whole thing was totally bizarre.

511
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,800
Like, we're there to do an interview with her to promote what she's doing.

512
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,920
But you can't look at her like someone get real.

513
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,000
In case it couldn't get any worse, around the time she was being publicly chastised,

514
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,040
further allegations made towards producers regarding inappropriate advances, actions and comments towards employees,

515
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:14,440
which include the invitation to provide one of our venerated executives with a hand job and even the occasional group here and there.

516
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:20,320
The main recipient of these allegations was producer Kevin Lemon, who many said veiled his conduct in sarcasm,

517
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,320
yet carried it out in the most predatory fashion.

518
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:27,720
There were also allegations which covered two other producers, Jonathan Norman and Ed Glavin.

519
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:34,440
This was corroborated by many other former employees and seemed to incriminate other producers who didn't take action against such behavior.

520
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,800
DeGeneres' own role is not explicitly spoken about, but as with previous instances,

521
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:44,000
it brings her position into question as a person whose environment should reflect her own values.

522
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,480
With these further contributions, it seemed that Ellen's reputation was practically in the gutter,

523
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,680
and with ratings in freefall being at least partly attributed to the ongoing outcry,

524
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,800
reprise seemed to be a distant dream.

525
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,160
You can't exactly be surprised, though, after all,

526
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:03,440
whether Ellen was an actively malicious actor or a distant celebrity no longer close to the inner workings of their own product,

527
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,360
it was undermining her own appeal, and as it stood,

528
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:11,560
these were the only two explanations that made sense of the situation, and neither made her look good.

529
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:16,920
However, as the walls were caving in, it seemed that Ellen may have one last shot at redemption,

530
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:22,440
coming from those most familiar with her, fellow celebrities who wanted to present a third perspective.

531
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,160
One much more sympathetic.

532
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:30,040
We're back with Katy Perry, and you're about to go on tour, and you are...

533
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:30,720
September.

534
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,040
You are single, and...

535
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,160
Ready to mingle!

536
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:34,680
Ready?

537
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:40,240
From the initial post by Kevin T. Porter, there had always been those who had spoken up for our besieged heroine,

538
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:46,040
telling of the genuinely positive experiences with her, and although it obviously doesn't represent a universal outlook,

539
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:51,680
the fact that a fair few of these testimonies were going against the Twitter grain made them seem more authentic in a way.

540
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,960
However, they had mostly been isolated and dismissed given their relatively faint presence in a sea of criticism.

541
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,320
With August, however, this was about to change.

542
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:04,720
As many had shared their negative experiences, public figures came out in droves to share their positive ones,

543
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,520
music producers, award-winning actors, comedians, and many more.

544
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,720
Their stories told a different narrative.

545
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,440
Sure, there may be rumors circulating, but the experience they had with Ellen was invaluable,

546
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,880
and she has done so many fantastic things for so many people.

547
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,320
She may not be perfect, but surely, whatever she was enduring right now wasn't fair.

548
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:28,000
She had brought much more light to this world than many others, and to oust her on the back of hearsay?

549
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,120
Well, that's just ludicrous.

550
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:35,200
The internet is a place full of negativity and stigmatization, and in a year like this,

551
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,520
it was time to take a step back and remember what people like Ellen really gave us.

552
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:45,000
A heartwarming sentiment, for sure, but was it enough to dig Ellen out of the hole she had found herself in?

553
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Well, let's talk about it.

554
00:47:48,880 --> 00:48:01,920
Chapter 3- The

555
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,320
Attestation

556
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:09,200
With the attestations coming from many household names, this third narrative began to gather steam.

557
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:15,000
There were so many people paying tribute to Ellen's character, many of whom would have significant personal background with her.

558
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,800
Maybe online toxicity had overcome us, and it was time to look at the bigger picture.

559
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,280
Some clearly agreed with this and echoed the sentiment on their timeline.

560
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:28,760
After all, Ellen had done much more for communities than many of those internet dwellers throwing secondhand shade.

561
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:34,320
However, at the same time, the celebrity narrative didn't exonerate Ellen in the way that one may have poked.

562
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:38,760
In fact, for some, it actually solidified more cynical theories relating to her demeanor.

563
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:43,440
Why is that? Well, let's think back to the initial instance, and what many allege they told us.

564
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:59,160
For many, it felt like Ellen provided preferential treatment to those in her elite circles, and had a tendency to shun those outside of that.

565
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:04,480
Therefore, it was completely plausible that those most likely to vouch for her were those in the elite circle.

566
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:11,360
Now, with that in mind, there are plenty of appeals to the greater positive effect that Ellen has generated beyond those who have direct experience with her,

567
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:15,280
given her records in fighting for human rights, animal rights, and many more.

568
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:20,360
This is all well and good, but it doesn't really dispel the main points against the TV personality.

569
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:25,280
From a social perspective, Ellen may have left a net positive impact on the world around her.

570
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,760
I'm sure there are many people that her feel-good spirit has touched and inspired on a day-to-day basis.

571
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:35,480
Equally, I'm sure there are many people who have been aided by charitable ventures and philanthropy,

572
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:43,480
but the moment that we let someone's net positive impact absolve them of all possible criticism is the time when our fundamental ability to think critically has failed.

573
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,240
Sure, there may be some points where appealing to a greater impact as a public figure is a valid response,

574
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:55,120
but responding to people sharing negative experiences and indictments on workplace toxicity doesn't fulfil this criteria.

575
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:00,920
A lot of these statements just feel like Ellen messaged the celebrity Twitter group chat asking people to vouch for her,

576
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:06,440
because it doesn't seem like any of these people actually have a clue who they're responding to or what's even happening,

577
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:12,520
and the fact that these posts were made a few days after the further impropriety allegations just makes them seem even more clueless.

578
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:18,040
At the end of the day, I'm sure we're all happy that people had a positive experience with someone who they greatly admired,

579
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:23,760
but this didn't alter what was happening elsewhere, and how many wanted more than just people saying she's nice.

580
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:31,640
Trust me, this sense of divide wasn't aided when former Ellen DJ Tony Okonboa commented that he personally stood with his fellow colleagues,

581
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:36,680
and had also experienced some of the reported toxicity in his decades shy stint on the show.

582
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:43,800
There was one glimpse of hope for Ellen on a more personal basis though, as Samantha Ronson, a person who has worked with Ellen on more than a few occasions,

583
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:49,560
came out in support of the under fire TV host, saying that her experiences as an employee have been positive,

584
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,720
creating at least some diversity from outside the celebrity clique.

585
00:50:52,760 --> 00:51:00,440
The current DJ Stephen Boss or Twitch had left a mostly ambiguous comment to the media, observing that in spite of the difficulties,

586
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:07,480
there was love. However, that love was clearly not present with three of the producers who in the next week were all fired by Warner Bros.

587
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:12,120
These individuals had been placed under the microscope following the allegations we discussed previously,

588
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:16,800
and it's clear that the parent company had viewed the allegations with the gravitas that they warranted,

589
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,120
or at least their media implications warranted.

590
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:24,080
Two of the three producers had pleaded their innocence previously, denying the claims made against them,

591
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:30,040
and as this was an internal investigation, it's hard to really comment on the reliability of what was being testified,

592
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,360
though given the volume of the claims, it is hard to dismiss.

593
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,160
Now, with that said, I think their fates were sealed regardless.

594
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:43,800
The whirlwind of media chaos whipped up had already given the corporate bigwigs a headache that was likely shortening their patience with the show's production team,

595
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:48,720
and to keep on the producers after such widely endorsed claims had surfaced would have been bad news for them.

596
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:55,520
In more ways than one, at the end of the day, they can be replaced with people who will hopefully land the corporation in less hot water.

597
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:00,920
The truth is, there's only one person behind the show who's ostensibly indispensable, and that's Ellen.

598
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:06,760
Therefore, the priority will be to keep her image as clean as possible, at all costs.

599
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:11,200
Now, they had mostly failed in this task in the months preceding, however, there wasn't much they could do,

600
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:17,800
the only person who could defend Ellen was Ellen, but at the same time, by doing so, she'd be opening up a can of worms.

601
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:21,880
Unfortunately, the worms escaped regardless, and had a lot of dirt.

602
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:30,280
The celebrity support should have at least provided her with some form of consolation, but in fact, it partially played into the aspersions espoused by her detractors.

603
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:36,880
It brought more attention to an unresolved issue which the company took seriously enough to sack three of their executive staff members,

604
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:42,680
and a load of rich people dismissing much of the online outrage as people spreading rumors was incredibly ill-timed,

605
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,440
particularly given the eventual outcome of the investigation.

606
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:51,640
Once the departure of their senior level staff was announced, Ellen went on a call to discuss it further with present employees,

607
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:58,480
where she is alleged to have contested certain claims about her character, such as those that asserted she did want people to make eye contact with her,

608
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:04,400
an assertion that she branded as false. As well as this, she reaffirmed her commitment to being much more active behind the scenes,

609
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:12,000
and not just being an on-screen persona, which is good. However, as she had likely realized now, this wasn't just about her employees,

610
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,840
this was a public issue where the inner workings of an otherwise beloved daytime program had been exposed,

611
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:25,520
and she had to be the one to put it right. In many ways, the sympathetic explanation of this predicament that we discussed at the start of this part

612
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:30,640
was still not out of the question, but some judgments can't come from third-party testimony alone.

613
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:38,320
Anyone can vouch for another person, but sometimes that person has to speak for themselves and let people judge them on the basis of their own sincerity.

614
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:46,440
This wasn't a situation where lawyers, producers, managers, or celebrities could speak on Ellen's behalf, this was a wrong that she had to write.

615
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:52,280
Ellen built a career on the back of kindness, a sentiment that when fabricated, people do not take lightly.

616
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:58,840
The question was whether Ellen was a woman of her word, and at this point, we didn't even know what her word was.

617
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:04,840
Now, when I spoke about the record low ratings on the Ellen DeGeneres show being partially attributed to controversy,

618
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:11,640
you may wonder what the other reasons were. Well, simply put, they were reruns, and reruns will inevitably draw less viewers,

619
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:18,280
as some have already watched the episodes being aired. Nonetheless, a new season was around the corner, and that meant a fresh start,

620
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:22,360
but you can't really start over until you bring this saga to an end.

621
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:28,160
Over the last few months, Ellen's reputation had been a living nightmare with many substantiated claims against her,

622
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:33,160
and as she had slowly transformed into this internet caricature, with not even an attempt to defend herself,

623
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:38,840
it felt like she was losing grip on what she even stood for, but she still had one thing, her show,

624
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:44,640
and that means she still had one more chance to redefine her values. Would she take that chance?

625
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,400
Well, she would have to dig deep.

626
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,240
Oh boy, welcome to season 18 of the Ellen DeGeneres show.

627
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:10,080
September the 21st, 2020, the 18th season of the Ellen DeGeneres show was brace release.

628
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:15,520
Its journey onto the screen, although not free from obstacles, had likely led many involved to a better place.

629
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:20,680
DJ Stephen Boss was also now an executive producer, so hopefully he would bring some of his signature love,

630
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:25,600
and all in all, it had made those responsible more committed to a supportive structure for employees.

631
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,880
I think we can all agree that this can be considered a broad positive.

632
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,320
However, it was always greater than this show.

633
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:36,840
It was about the person at the center, and that individual still had many devotees and detractors alike,

634
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:42,240
waiting for her to tackle what had cast a great shadow over her throughout this tumultuous year.

635
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:46,840
In a way, this wasn't just for her, but for everyone who had looked up to her over the years,

636
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:50,640
an overt renewal of a doctrine that had been taken for granted previously.

637
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,520
This time, she had to mean it. How did she fare?

638
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:59,240
As you may have heard, this summer there were allegations of a toxic work environment at our show,

639
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,160
and then there was an investigation.

640
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:04,320
I learned that things happened here that never should have happened.

641
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:08,800
I take that very seriously, and I want to say I am so sorry to the people who were affected.

642
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:13,880
I know that I'm in a position of privilege and power, and I realize that with that comes responsibility,

643
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:17,280
and I take responsibility for what happens at my show.

644
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:23,400
We have had a lot of conversations over the last few weeks about the show, our workplace, and what we want for the future.

645
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,520
We have made the necessary changes, and today we are starting a new chapter.

646
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:33,120
Well, the apology is quite brief in the context of the show, and mostly addresses claims in their general state.

647
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:38,320
As shown in the clip previously, she discusses the office environment and accepts responsibility for misconduct

648
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,800
that occurred under her nose.

649
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:45,000
In fact, this part is all executed reasonably well, with Ellen reiterating the need for a fresh start.

650
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,720
However, we then reach the crux of a lot of people's issues, Ellen's own character,

651
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:57,400
something which the TV host should know better than anyone else, and her apology slash apologia is certainly a sight to behold.

652
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:03,520
There are also articles in the press and on social media that said that I am not who I appear to be on TV,

653
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,520
because I became known as the Be Kind Lady.

654
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,760
The truth is, I am that person that you see on TV.

655
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,680
I am also a lot of other things.

656
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:17,240
I sometimes I get sad, I get mad, I get anxious, I get frustrated, I get impatient.

657
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:24,040
I am a work in progress, and I'm especially working on the impatience thing because it's not going well.

658
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:30,720
In her monologue, she once more avoids specific details, opting instead to confront the general sentiment behind the allegations,

659
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:34,000
and the message that many within the press were using the stories to push.

660
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:41,120
She calls upon her humanity and her imperfections, and concedes that she isn't perfect, but is working every day to improve it.

661
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,200
A very noble ethos indeed.

662
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:49,920
She finishes by having a discussion with the new producer, Twitch, and using it as a vehicle to convey that sense of progress.

663
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:59,400
You know, the song was a little crazy, it was intense, but during that time, there's been a lot of learning, a lot of discussions, a lot of listening.

664
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:08,160
You and I have had numerous discussions, and for me, I'm just so excited to be back here in the studio so we can do what we do best,

665
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:15,760
which is bring laughter, love, and fun, right? And also lead by example by putting our best foot forward after a bounce back, right?

666
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,040
So it's all love. I'm so excited for this season.

667
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,880
It's all love. That's all that's real is love. That's the truth.

668
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:31,920
After this delightful speech, Ellen moved on. I mean, she moved on to the next segment of her show, which I'll assume is hilarious comedy and trademark Ellen-generous hijinks.

669
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,200
Thank goodness it was all over.

670
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:39,840
Yet for many people, it wasn't over. In fact, the reception on the subsequent YouTube upload was not the warmest,

671
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:45,320
with the like-dislike ratios indicating a widespread rejection of Ellen's return and subsequent declamation.

672
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:49,720
Most comments and video responses were tinged by a clear doubt in her integrity.

673
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:57,200
After all, with such plentiful allegations, you cannot easily brush it aside in the space of five minutes with a I'm not perfect, so what narrative.

674
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:03,960
I always try to grow as a person. I look at everything that comes into my life as an opportunity to learn.

675
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:08,960
I got into this business to make people laugh and feel good. That's that's my favorite thing to do.

676
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:15,760
And now I am a boss of 270 people, 270 people who helped make this show what it is.

677
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:23,720
Two hundred seventy people. I am so grateful for.

678
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,760
All I want is for every single one of them to be happy and to be proud to work here.

679
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:35,800
However, what did I think? Well, after going through the whole situation, this video struck a weird chord for sure.

680
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:40,840
It is brief. The humor interspersed with these serious apologies feels a bit awkward.

681
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:49,080
The laugh tracks aren't necessary, and they carry on cutting back to Twitch clapping at very unprompted points like Ellen just ended racism,

682
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:53,960
and also talks about what's going on in the world, which, although not necessarily used as a point of defense,

683
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:58,840
can feel like it's trying to detract from the allegations, which isn't what you really desire from this sort of video.

684
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:07,360
At the same time, I feel like as Ellen's super fans go, they will be won over by this explanation, and to be fair, I can't exactly blame them for that.

685
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:14,480
My hope is that we can still be a place of happiness and joy. I still want to be the one hour a day that people can go to escape and laugh.

686
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:21,240
I want to continue to help all the people that we help every day, and I'm committed to making this the best season that we have ever had.

687
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:28,400
When I spoke about the celebrity elite earlier, I mentioned how, in many ways, a lot of their comments were irrelevant to the charges brought against her,

688
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,680
because the greater character implications only followed from specific instance.

689
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:38,160
Here, Ellen doesn't address the specific instance, and that will understandably frustrate viewers.

690
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:45,920
At the same time, she deals with them in a way that does umbrella the allegations, and seek to explain them through the lens that the be kind narrative

691
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:51,760
is obviously not always the most beneficial to her image, as it's not always something she can commit to.

692
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:58,080
She is not perfect, and this seeks to tackle the underlying insinuations behind other claims.

693
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:04,440
Being known as the be kind lady is a tricky position to be in, so let me give you some advice out there.

694
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:09,200
Anybody's thinking of changing their title, or giving yourself a nickname, do not go with the be kind lady.

695
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,640
Don't do it.

696
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:17,680
This is where it becomes even more complicated, and I would like to reintroduce the previous explanations for her behavior,

697
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,120
the more cynical and the more sympathetic.

698
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:26,000
With commentators and critics alike, many have began to work off the assumption that Ellen was this bad person,

699
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,640
a tyrant who treated her employees terribly, and therefore, of course, this speech would not win them over,

700
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:37,560
because the only way to really undermine that rather unforgiving narrative would be if Ellen directly responded to,

701
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:42,560
and debunked each and every more austere allegation, that was simply not going to happen.

702
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:46,880
In a way, we have been blessed by comprehensive responses from YouTubers in the past,

703
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:51,520
because the allegations often feel more personal to them, and they want to clear themselves,

704
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,640
but it's not something that translates across to other industries.

705
01:01:54,640 --> 01:02:01,160
Ellen wasn't going to release a 40 minute tell all response to each individual claim with some ambiguous lowercase title,

706
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,920
not if she didn't feel like she needed to.

707
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:06,400
No, her responses take cues from both the other two explanations.

708
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:11,520
On one hand, she clearly was out of touch, and she should be more involved in the well being of those around her.

709
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,600
She had become distant from what she had previously found affinity with.

710
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:19,960
At the same time, she is human and will have bad days where people may not see the best side of her.

711
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:30,240
I've played a straight woman in movies, so I'm a pretty good actress, but I don't think that I'm that good that I could come out here every day for 17 years and fool you.

712
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:31,560
This is me.

713
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:36,760
If people were more inclined to show leniency towards Ellen, people like her supporters,

714
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:39,360
then I think they may well buy this explanation.

715
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:44,240
Ellen appeals to those fans when she talks about her time on the show, how they should know her.

716
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:47,160
This is not directed at those who already dislike her.

717
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:52,480
This is for people who are going to be responsive, who have stuck around, who have seen what Ellen has done.

718
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,280
After all, whether people choose to forgive her or not,

719
01:02:55,320 --> 01:03:00,240
those who were not Ellen enthusiasts before are unlikely to become Ellen enthusiasts after,

720
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:05,600
and if Ellen transformed the show into one elongated response, she would only hemorrhage more viewers.

721
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:10,840
This was an appeal to people who knew her, who knew who the real Ellen was.

722
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,240
But was it enough?

723
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:13,240
Really?

724
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,120
Who was the real Ellen?

725
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:32,080
Over the next month following the response, and leading up to the time of writing this script,

726
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:36,600
Ellen's show has found some semblance of stability, however, ratings have been down,

727
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,760
and that has been unsurprisingly picked up by many outlets.

728
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:44,640
With the current circumstances changing the world as we know it, it's hard to tell if this is permanent,

729
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:48,680
but it will certainly foster some disquietude amongst the corporate honchos.

730
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:52,680
All right, Guillermo, you have to go down. It's gonna be good. You're going down, Guillermo.

731
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:53,680
All right.

732
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,120
Don't worry, Guillermo.

733
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,520
How was that?

734
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:58,800
Terrible.

735
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,320
Okay.

736
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,200
Oh, my God. Are we done?

737
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,560
No, you're going back up.

738
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:08,800
The show itself hasn't changed too much, which has been a bit more involved in comparison to previous seasons.

739
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,320
I guess as one of the more perceptibly unproblematic individuals,

740
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:17,920
his presence is a more effective instrument to win back people who may feel disillusioned with Ellen and her routine.

741
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,000
There are still stories being published here and there about how Ellen has treated those around her,

742
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
though unless there are any huge developments,

743
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,800
I'd expect these to fade as people gradually lose interest in the topic and move on to the next badly behaving star,

744
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,720
leaving this American idol to her own devices,

745
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:36,120
rebuilding that which she may have lost before she loses far more.

746
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,920
It's hard to believe that the plug will be pulled with the current ratings,

747
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:44,120
and it's still important to remember that a bad season for Ellen is still far better than a good season for most broadcasts.

748
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:48,640
At the same time, doing badly by one's own standards can still be demoralizing,

749
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:52,840
and there will be questions as to whether it's worth pushing on under such pretenses.

750
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,600
As it stands, it appears that she will,

751
01:04:54,600 --> 01:05:00,640
but there's no real surprise behind why viewership may well be down for a program that couldn't respect its own foundations.

752
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:04,840
Ellen herself took the reputational benefits that the show bestowed onto her for granted,

753
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,480
and eventually it came back to bite her.

754
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,440
But the burning question is, how much did she know, and what exactly did she do?

755
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,040
What rubs a lot of people the wrong way is the hypocrisy of it.

756
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:17,240
When you project this image out of the world of being kind and loving and charitable,

757
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:23,640
but it turns out to all be a facade to make yourself look better when in actuality you're kind of a monster behind the scenes,

758
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:27,040
that's worse than just unapologetically being an asshole.

759
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:31,160
You reel people in with this fake persona and get them to fall in love with you,

760
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,840
but you've actually been lying to their face this entire time.

761
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:38,080
YouTubers and much of the press were largely unanimous in delivering their prognosis,

762
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:42,960
often framing Ellen as indifferent to the suffering of those around her, even outright indulging in it.

763
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,960
This was backed up by testimonies from people who claim to work with her,

764
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:50,400
and substantial evidence that for many elaborated on an already well grounded perspective.

765
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:55,600
However, with all this acknowledged, I feel like it was quite a selective set of evidence picked by those online.

766
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,160
But I do agree, we shouldn't only be blaming Ellen.

767
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:02,400
I would also say that Warner is probably more guilty here than what Ellen is.

768
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:07,400
Oh, and of course, the other employees who also contributed in making the workspace terrible.

769
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:13,080
For me personally, it's difficult to ignore the number of testimonies which actually refrained from incriminating Ellen,

770
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:15,320
especially those outside the celebrity clique.

771
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:19,840
The comprehensive expose from former employees stresses that Ellen was not directly aware,

772
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:22,720
even though she did neglect a certain degree of responsibility.

773
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:26,720
Are the stories where she's presented as a borderline psychopath incompatible with this?

774
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:31,400
Not entirely, but the depiction of the workplace where Ellen is like this detached matriarch

775
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:36,120
kind of makes it harder to believe that she also occupied the role of the power hungry dictator

776
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:41,240
who punishes people for her own pleasure, especially when some of her former colleagues go as far to defend her.

777
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:45,440
At the same time, there were former employees who would attack her, such as ex-producer Hedda Muscat,

778
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:51,040
who, working with Ellen between 2002 and 2004, had a very different idea of her awareness.

779
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:57,720
She laughed, and she said every production needs their dog, meaning Ed is her dog.

780
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:58,600
Like her attack dog.

781
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,880
Her attack dog, so therefore she doesn't need to do that.

782
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:07,520
He took the role of being the attack dog that she didn't have to now be the attack dog, so she didn't have to yell.

783
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:13,200
So when Ellen says she's not aware of this environment, you don't think that rings true?

784
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:13,920
It's a lie.

785
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,360
With all this factored in, it does become conflicting.

786
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:22,640
There are so many people with different ideas of who Ellen is, especially given that many of them worked the show at the same time,

787
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:28,280
and they may all have their own reasons for the positions they take, reasons that we'll never fully understand.

788
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:32,680
Now, as said, there isn't a reality where these two experiences can't coexist,

789
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:36,520
and the people who have advocated for it certainly makes it worthy of consideration,

790
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:42,160
but by writing out people's nuanced thoughts to suit a more one-dimensional character portrait, you risk two things.

791
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:47,760
First of all, downplaying the role that other actors have plagued, the corporation, producers, colleagues, for example,

792
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:53,320
and secondly, undermining the actual experience many of the more solidified allegations seem to imply.

793
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:58,480
I think that a lot of viewers had predetermined opinions, which led to a lot of people becoming overly pedantic

794
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:03,600
with what was really just a pretty average response to drama, even with some of these experts.

795
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:07,200
Oh boy, welcome to season 18 of the Ellen DeGeneres Show.

796
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,000
DeGeneres Show. DeGeneres Show.

797
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,800
So there's a bit of a self-sooth followed by a prayer, we've got a behavioural cluster.

798
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:17,800
Although she's trying to give this jovial, energetic, hey, it's okay, let's move on,

799
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:25,480
she's very aware, very aware about the potential downside of getting this wrong, but why should she be bothered about it?

800
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:30,120
If she hasn't done the stuff that she's been accused of, why is she praying?

801
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:35,520
What? I'm sorry, but I would be 100% uncomfortable addressing allegations whether they were true or not.

802
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:40,360
Telling someone that they don't have anything to worry about if they haven't done anything wrong is a good pet talk,

803
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:43,280
but it's certainly not an impenetrable attack on the accused.

804
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:47,640
You can make the argument that the fact that she's nervous is indicative that she clearly does care about this,

805
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:51,960
and I feel to a degree she would have faced criticism however she approached the response.

806
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:56,600
Or this comment which states that because she added a conditional clause, she was dismissing responsibility,

807
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:01,400
despite the fact that saying if was the most logical placement in the sentence given its generality.

808
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:06,000
And if I've ever let someone down, if I've ever hurt their feelings, I am so sorry for that.

809
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,440
If that's ever the case, I have let myself down and I've hurt myself as well.

810
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:15,000
If you use if in these circumstances, you are not a bad person, and I don't think it means that you're dismissing it.

811
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:19,000
I've used it in that context before, and I don't think that it's unfair to use it.

812
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:26,120
It seems like so many people are trying to galaxy brain analyze her statement when it may just be a bit lackluster and contrived.

813
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:31,880
In other cases, stories can be twisted, either through hyperbole for anecdotal purposes or the classic scenario of telephone.

814
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,640
Another good example of this is the chip nail polish incident.

815
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:41,000
One commenter recalled that the situation in question involved Ellen phoning up the branch management and attempting to have the employee fired following it,

816
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:47,520
but then the actual person who was at the center of the commotion commented saying Ellen had made a complaint which almost resulted in her being fired.

817
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:53,160
Now, I'm not trying to use this as a gotcha moment to prove the story as false because I don't disbelieve it one iota.

818
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:56,600
Once again, it's a case of how stories can be contorted by narratives.

819
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:02,120
A complaint with the intent to encourage a dismissal is very different to a complaint that almost leads to a dismissal,

820
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:04,920
as one implies much more about a plaintiff's intent.

821
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:07,240
Neither version of events flatters Ellen, of course.

822
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:11,200
I still think it's rather daft, but the difference is still notable.

823
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:17,800
This story is altered by Farah herself in an all stand up routine, obviously for humorous effect, and I don't think it discredits her story at all,

824
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:22,200
but it's easy to see how such details are told sparingly when they don't hold too much consequence,

825
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:25,920
even though with today's context, they may be decisive in understanding Ellen,

826
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:31,120
and I think some testimonies did fall foul to this weakness, especially ones told from a third party perspective.

827
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:37,000
I understand self-torture because for years I worked at an organic vegan mecca bag out of restaurant serving people.

828
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:48,400
Um, until I was released after a really popular talk show host emailed the owner and complained about my chips nail polish.

829
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,200
True story.

830
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:56,280
With a lot of these stories, if you become too fixated on the role Ellen plays and not the ways that other individuals may have contributed,

831
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:03,440
insensitive or coercive producers or anyone behind the scenes who is often much less accountable but still may hold a degree of power,

832
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:10,120
it's easy to lose sight of who else may have actually contributed to a situation and how they may also need to be held responsible for their actions.

833
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:13,000
In some ways, Ellen had gotten away with too much for too long.

834
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,280
At the same time, she shouldn't become a scapegoat too easily for other people's misdoings either.

835
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:22,560
The whole Ellen is a sadistic psycho narrative may be more exciting, but is it the most plausible?

836
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:23,720
I'll let you decide.

837
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:30,360
That's a more devil's advocate argument, but now I will leave on some more assured criticism because there's more than enough to go around.

838
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:36,680
Whether Ellen's genuinely mean or not, it seems there are a lot of legitimate grievances stemming from less than perfect encounters.

839
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:44,440
From an outsider's perspective, Ellen allowed herself to be separated from the masses, to subsequently fall out of touch with narratives that she branded herself with.

840
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:48,800
We're all going to be cold and distant from time to time, and I wouldn't attack her on the basis of that,

841
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:55,040
but I think it's very possible that this distance led to tone-deaf and insensitive behavior that has likely hurt a fair few people.

842
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:59,800
It could equally lend itself to pedantic micromanaging and comments that rub others the wrong way.

843
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:05,480
One of the saddest situations that encompasses this is Ellen's relationship with her head writer Karen Kilgerich,

844
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:11,360
a previously strong and productive bond broken apart by partisan interests with Ellen just going with it.

845
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:17,280
For me, if something like that happened, especially with business as it is, I would talk to them, understand their perspective.

846
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:21,840
Ellen didn't have enough control of her own production, or even her own character sometimes,

847
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:26,000
and even if what she felt from time to time was real, the show just wasn't.

848
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:32,560
It was a well-produced veneer to another rote broadcast that suffered from the same issues that is symptomatic of too many Hollywood creations.

849
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:36,120
It needed more humanity, and maybe Ellen needs it too.

850
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:37,600
Ellen- This is me.

851
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:43,040
The season 18 monologue wasn't the first time Ellen had spoken about her brand of kindness, and the toll it can take.

852
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:48,320
In the 2018 interview that I quoted earlier on in the video, she spoke about the mythical real Ellen,

853
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:53,680
and the weight of audience expectations on her to maintain a brand that she doesn't always identify with.

854
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:59,960
The article emphasising this, revealing that in person she's more blunt, introspective, and interesting than she is on the show,

855
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:04,560
willing to express mild irritation that may seem off-key in front of a national audience.

856
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:10,840
Some expect her to smile all the time, be cheerful, even dance, something that she stopped doing on her show a few years back,

857
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,680
because it was just too much.

858
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:17,360
At the same time, even with the controversy, she's continued to pursue the kindness image,

859
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:20,720
even recently launching this lovely Be Kind merchandise.

860
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:25,720
James Corden- She's around for too long, Fallon. All these people walk away. You've been famous forever.

861
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:29,440
Walk away like eventually everybody, they're just gonna figure it out.

862
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:33,360
A lot of people close to Ellen recognised what the show had done for her public persona,

863
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:38,080
but you could also observe that the show had constrained her image in a way that previous ventures hadn't,

864
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:40,480
establishing standards that she couldn't live up to.

865
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:45,040
Some around Ellen, her wife included, had encouraged DeGeneres to consider other avenues,

866
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,920
yet our intrepid title character persevered.

867
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:54,160
If the pre-allegation interview evinced anything, it was that the TV star saw her career path as a mixed blessing,

868
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:59,400
and was more aware of the perils than some may think, but it couldn't avert the inevitable tragedy.

869
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:04,920
The use of this interview to promote her Netflix comedy special Relatable is certainly ironic in hindsight,

870
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:08,520
the theme being satirical commentary on her place amongst the media elite,

871
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:13,200
and detachment from the Hoi Paloi, a concept that would rear its head in coming capers.

872
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:18,640
Ellen- A few years ago, I started ending my show by saying be kind to one another, but here's the downside.

873
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:22,960
I can never do anything unkind ever. I shouldn't even have a horn in my car.

874
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:27,720
Like, if someone cuts me off in a dangerous way, if I honk, they're like, Ellen?

875
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:36,600
Kindness is a virtue, not a brand, and expecting anyone to be the paragon of such a pure quality is bound to cause disappointment.

876
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:41,440
At the same time, it's not wrong to expect better from someone who claimed to be better,

877
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:46,680
someone who used the kindness narrative when it suited them, extending it to people who many would argue hadn't

878
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:50,680
practiced it themselves, yet neglecting it with those who probably needed it more.

879
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:57,480
Ellen seemed to be lost in the cosmos of her own status, and if anything, I hope the situation will pull her back down to Earth.

880
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:01,720
At the start of this video, I spoke about the similarities between YouTubers and talk show hosts,

881
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:07,880
however, what they may share in presentation, they differ greatly in composition, and Ellen is a prime example of that,

882
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:14,760
a person who, character aside, many will now see as an algorithmically calibrated puppet maintained by a contract,

883
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:21,280
rather than whatever the real Ellen is. The only person who may know who the real Ellen is, is Ellen herself,

884
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:26,360
and I hope she takes the time to find out what that means, however, if she wants to reclaim her public image,

885
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:31,640
then it may take more than just a monologue, it's going to take gradual healing exemplified by her own actions,

886
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:35,080
and I hope those who still believe in her will be rewarded in their faith.

887
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:43,560
Before I knew it, I had a successful sitcom, and I came out, and then I lost that sitcom, and then I got another sitcom,

888
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:54,440
and I lost that sitcom too, and after that, I got a talk show, and I was able to be myself, and it was 17 years ago,

889
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:59,400
and I feel like you've all really gotten to know me over the past 17 years.

890
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:05,480
The Ellen DeGeneres arc is certainly a fascinating one, a person who built an image from a philosophy rooted in struggle,

891
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:12,360
some of which she experienced directly with her TV career, only to be accused of deserting it when she ascended the industry ranks.

892
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:18,360
It's not a rare phenomenon, plenty of people are corrupted this way, but it seemed more exceptional given her own convictions,

893
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:23,640
and as a person who had been widely regarded as a national treasure, her downfall was almost awaited by those

894
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:29,880
who knew the potential of such a story, the twist villain per se, with content on and off YouTube attracting widespread

895
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:35,800
publicity and pulling apart what had taken years to construct. Whether the damage to her image will ever be repaired

896
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:41,560
is another question, and it'll depend on factors within, and likely beyond her control. Until then, the best she can do

897
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:46,360
is show that she does truly care about kindness, because heaven knows we need it right now.

898
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:51,160
I want to thank Olivia Munn, Ryan Gosling, Macklemore, have a wonderful weekend, be kind to one another, bye.

899
01:16:53,640 --> 01:17:10,440
That was the video, what a great video, we had a great time recording that, I want to give big thanks to my editors,

900
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:18,840
what a great set of chaps, and chapesses, and chaperinos, love you all, and make sure you check them out in the pinned comment,

901
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:27,080
as always, big thanks to my Patreons, or my Patreons, as I've been informed, $10 patrons are up on screen right now,

902
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:34,920
but I want to give a special personal thanks to my $50 patrons, Devon, Shirochigo, Amanda, Hypercube, CarolinaSumhalaBlue,

903
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:44,040
Tree, and PokeySiren, also $50 patrons, and my $100 patron, Christopher Karas, thank you so much for your continued support,

904
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:48,120
it really does make a difference, I cannot express that enough, I love you guys.

905
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:53,240
My social medias will also be in the pinned comments, I don't know what else I have to add at this point,

906
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:59,800
I had a great time recording this, as aforementioned, my ear was playing up, but I just stuck a headphone,

907
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:05,720
a little Raycon bud in there quite deep, and that has suppressed it for now, which has allowed me to talk over it,

908
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:11,400
so if you're listening to this ear, fuck you, if you're listening to this, anyone else, thank you,

909
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:14,360
and thank you for your continued support. Take care, guys.
