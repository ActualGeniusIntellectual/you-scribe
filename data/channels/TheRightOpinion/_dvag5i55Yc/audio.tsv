28200	29440	Let's get into the video.
39000	43480	Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the right opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
43480	48960	And for those well accustomed to this channel, you know that I have a habit of covering topics that typically pertain to the YouTube sphere.
48960	53000	I do this for a variety of reasons. It's consistent with my brand. You guys enjoy it.
53000	56640	I have great personal investment in the subjects and the views aren't too shabby either.
56640	63440	All these factors aren't considered when taking on a new project, and as you can envision, my head runs a series of complex mathematical algorithms
63440	66840	to calculate the most suitable themes to cover in my upcoming content.
66840	74720	However, every now and then there is a disturbance in the matrix, the tro computer malfunctions, and a topic is chosen because I feel like it.
74720	79560	Yes, I know, shocking as it may be, I do possess the ability to experience feelings.
79560	84560	Today, this emotional intuition has led me to one of the most iconic talk show hosts of all time,
84600	88600	and perhaps the not so unfamiliar fate that befell them this abysmal year.
88600	94200	You see, as I've subtly alluded to just now, YouTubers have personas, myself included.
94200	97640	Although these personas will seldom completely mirror the individual behind them,
97640	104120	we tend to develop a more personal connection with them than we do with most celebrities because of the many personal elements that have been integrated.
104120	111320	YouTube intimacy has always been a specific selling point, and where we may separate the art and the artist in various branches of entertainment,
111320	114800	with content creators, the relationship seems a little more inextricable.
114800	119520	However, probably one of the most similar genres to that of YouTube is the American talk show host.
119520	123960	I will shut down Twitch. I will shut down YouTube gaming. I have that power.
123960	130880	For years, we have perceived them as an invasive species on the platform, and to be honest, I can't say I'm particularly enthusiastic about their presence.
130880	134920	However, their involvement makes a lot of sense, especially given how they brand themselves.
134920	139320	Hell, the overlap is so obvious now we even have a YouTuber who became a talk show host.
139320	143600	That's a video for another time. For those who are familiar with this brand of TV personality,
143600	150160	you'll know that in spite of the scripted sequences and the big name guests, there's a lot of weight in the actual host and the qualities they hold.
150160	157680	Whether it's the suave-suited, sadonic bite of Trevor Noah, the reasoned incision of Stephen Colbert, or the James Corden,
157680	163920	each holds their own appeal. However, few can lay claim to the degree of market dominance that one woman has commanded,
163920	166360	that woman being Oprah Winfrey.
166360	174760	This calls for a drum roll. Cue the drum roll. All right, open your boxes. Open your boxes. One, two, three.
174760	185480	You get a car! You get a car! You get a car! You get a car! You get a car! You get a car! You get a car! You get a car!
185480	188760	You get a car! Everybody gets a car!
188760	196000	Haha, get baited, punks. Though completely true, of course, the Oprah Winfrey show has been off-air for just shy of a decade now.
196040	202320	However, it was over 20 years ago in 1997 when an individual by the name of Ellen DeGeneres appeared on Oprah's show
202320	205400	to speak openly about her sexuality for the first time.
205400	210760	Why did you think it was necessary for you to come out? You know, you've read some of the mail, people say,
210760	216720	so if you're gonna, why not just let that be your business? Why was it necessary for you to come out, tell the public,
216720	221320	why was it necessary for the character to do so? Because it's okay.
222080	227160	At that point, Ellen was a star of the popular sitcom Ellen. Fitting name.
227160	231880	James was coming out was integrated into the plotline of that show as well, with the revelation occurring in a scene where
231880	237480	Oprah played Ellen's therapist. The episode that contained the sequence became one of the most viewed in the show's history,
237480	243640	attracting an audience of 42 million. However, in spite of this, reception was mixed from within the industry and political spectrum
243640	249840	alike, with some advertisers pulling slots, and pressure from family rights concern groups. How delightful.
249880	255840	Although Ellen was renewed for a fifth season, Disney owned ABC-ran parental advisory warnings before each episode,
255840	261680	which alongside other factors was attributed as engineering the show's decline in ratings and eventual cancellation,
261680	265240	stimulating debate over LGBT discrimination within the field.
265240	267240	What about this was adult content?
267760	281440	Depicting characters who are gay on television in physical acts, I believe, is adult content.
281440	287600	But how is that more adult content than heterosexual couples rolling around in bed, which they do?
287600	294320	Again, we're making a judgment about what our society is comfortable with and what they might not be comfortable with.
294320	298200	Aren't we then just enabling a prejudice in the audience?
298200	301200	We're not telling people necessarily not to watch it.
301200	306080	Ellen's TV career encountered a bit of a rough patch over the following years, with another attempt at a sitcom,
306080	313120	The Ellen Show, failing to find success. However, come 2003, the winds of change were finally blowing in the direction of our comedienne.
313120	318360	Firstly, with the release of the animated film Finding Nemo, where she played a memorable character by the name of Dory,
318360	323520	a fish with short-term memory loss. The distinctive voice performance won Ellen both praise and awards,
323520	327040	fortifying her status as an innovative and versatile entertainer.
327040	334000	However, the best was yet to come, because in September, the first transmission of a little program known as The Ellen DeGeneres Show was broadcast.
334000	340440	It's September 8th, this is our very, very first show, and you are my very first audience.
340440	347720	The Ellen DeGeneres Show, commonly shortened to Ellen, is a daytime talk series, hosted by none other than our well-acquainted friend Ellen DeGeneres.
347760	353200	Its philosophy is often portrayed as one of positivity, accented by a light-hearted tone,
353200	358200	with audience and celebrity guest involvement in a variety of games, pranks, jokes, and giveaways.
358200	364160	Since its inception just over 17 years ago, Ellen's show has steadily ascended the daytime TV ratings hierarchy,
364160	369840	often only being bested by the man Dr. Phil himself. The show has received 61 Daytime Emmy Awards,
369840	377600	spawned spin-off series such as Ellen Games of Games, and garnered the reputation as a space where one can turn themselves off from all the stress in the world.
377640	381080	An asset that becomes ever more valuable in times like these.
381520	386600	Nonetheless, it wouldn't be possible to convey that message if the host didn't encompass those same values,
386620	394520	and in Ellen, many found someone who is a beacon in that darkness, a doctrine of kindness represented by a person who had faced hardships to be where they are today,
394540	398000	but had come through and wanted to share that spirit with you.
398000	403960	I don't think you have to have a talk show to, uh, to be nice to people, to do what I'm doing.
403960	409200	Um, I just think that kindness is something that we should all have.
409200	414240	That's an innate quality that we have, and we need to, we need more of that out there.
414240	421560	Be kind to one another, a simple but powerful precept, and one that to many, Ellen appeared to live by herself.
421560	425640	However, in a time where many felt that kindness was more imperative than ever,
425680	433400	some began to claim that it had, in fact, deserted her, while others, well, asserted it was never even there in the first place.
433880	442520	What followed was a media propelled deluge of allegations that threatened to alter the perception of a beloved TV icon and everything that people thought she stood for.
442880	447080	Conversely, many jumped to her defense, stating that these character attacks were unwarranted,
447080	452200	that critics had imposed unfair standards, and that Ellen was still the person that she had always claimed to be.
452520	456680	Was this a person under attack, or a persona under the microscope?
456680	459400	Well, there's only one way of attempting to find out.
459400	465160	Ladies, gentlemen, folks, I suggest we begin to unravel this curious, curious case.
473000	476920	You see, what seems recent actually goes back a bit further than you may think.
476920	481160	So to fully understand what we're dealing with today, we're going to dust off the Tro Time Machine,
481160	486240	give it a spin, and gather some intel to grasp what laid the foundations for the coming charades.
486240	494760	I've been studying kindness for the past 17 years on this show, and I thought I could help with some research that, you know, like, I don't know, these are things that I've learned.
494760	500000	So consider me your professor. This is like Kindness 101, so pay attention. This is on the midterm.
500000	505520	The Ellen DeGeneres show has, in a way, established Ellen as an icon, unlike anything else she has created.
505520	510680	This is not to diminish her contributions to her career prior, we should acknowledge that these things are cumulative.
510680	513080	But when people think of Ellen, they think of this.
513080	519680	All right, what I want everyone in this room to do is just think kind thoughts.
519680	523720	Let's witness the power of kindness. Let's just think kind thoughts, everybody.
523720	531280	In a way, that is incredible, and the fact that so many people have that innate association is a testament to her skills as a performer.
531280	537760	Yet at the same time, given the marketing and framing of the program, a lot of viewers and even guests will receive the impression
537760	544800	the Ellen DeGeneres show is fundamentally what happens when you just take Ellen and stick her in front of the cameras for 40 minutes.
544800	550080	In a way, this is part of the charm. At the same time, this is an unrealistic interpretation.
550080	554240	Now, does this mean that Ellen isn't a kind or even good person? Not necessarily.
554240	560720	Ellen preaches those virtues on and off the air, but at the same time, it's clear that some had a mental image of Ellen,
560720	564920	which didn't match their subsequent experience, particularly when the cameras weren't rolling.
565080	570920	For gossip magazines, when someone expressed this sentiment publicly, it was indicative of the quote real Ellen,
570920	574040	and had been the predominant point against her for a fair few years.
574040	579360	In a way, I think that was the result of the fact that certain skeptics found Ellen's shtick too good to be true,
579360	584920	and with the online world, when someone appears so wholesome and perfect, some people feel disposed to depose them.
584920	591040	There were insider leaks and celebrities who had negative experiences with her, such as Kathy Griffin and Corinne Olympios,
591040	597520	with the film describing her as having quite a mean streak, and the latter referring to her on a podcast as very cold.
597520	600520	Would you say that's a great representation of yourself?
600520	607800	Um, that is a real me. It is definitely a real side of me, but there are many other sides.
607800	611080	Now, it's important to note that these were mostly fringe rumours at this point.
611080	615320	Fudes and unfavourable interactions are not unexpected in the industry.
615320	620800	Some outlets jumped on them because, as scoops, they are pretty interesting and challenge the universal outlook,
620800	622960	but most people didn't pay them much regard.
622960	629840	However, the fact that minor comments received this publicity was a sign that many were ready to have their expectations subverted.
629840	634800	Hell, a 2017 YouTube video from Cavos on this matter has amassed over 10 million views,
634800	637280	most of which came long before 2020.
637280	639280	Go sit in that Ellen jail over there right now.
652280	655280	I mean, look how pissed Ellen is. Look at her face.
655280	660280	I have never seen her act like this ever. It's fucking weird and all over her hat.
660280	663800	And yes, people are laughing, even Ellen's, you know, cracking a few laughs,
663800	672800	but this lady has been shamed in front of 13 million people on YouTube, a live audience and millions watching at home.
672800	673680	And for what?
673680	677280	Keep in mind that Cavos is a creator who primarily focuses on YouTube drama,
677280	679880	and although his upload received mixed feedback on release,
679880	683360	the traffic was indicative of the potential that such narratives harboured.
683360	691400	That video focused on a rather peculiar clip in which Ellen roasts an audience member for taking more than one item from her merch stand against displayed instructions.
693800	710600	Some of these more contentious clips have resurfaced over the years, attracting little slivers of public attention.
710600	716800	These excerpts may have appeared while intended in concept, but could translate into practice as mean-spirited or blinkered.
716800	723600	With that said, the video itself isn't anything extreme, and Cavos prefaces his critique with the acknowledgement that he actually likes Ellen.
723600	732000	This is how many felt about her at the time, and it seemed that a lot of the criticism would amount to individual experiences of Ellen which didn't turn out as anticipated.
732000	738960	This is the perspective that Ellen's wife Portia de Rossi echoed on an interview for Ellen's 2018 Netflix stand-up special Relatable,
738960	744240	stating that she's just a bit more complicated than she appears on the show, there's more range of emotion.
744240	752880	In the same article, a friend and director, Tegan Attaro, affirms this, stating that being trapped in the world of being asked to dance and expected to be nice,
752880	760000	it's real, and adding, I'm sure there's people who think she's kidding, or can't have a bad day, but she does, it's an interesting pickle she's in.
760000	767360	Ellen has bad days, and unfortunately, some people are gonna see that from time to time, especially people who've had limited experience with her.
767360	774000	Could such a point of view hold back public approval? Perhaps, if each claim was treated as an outlier rather than a pattern.
774000	781680	For a while, this was the case, mostly given the sparse and separate nature of previous negative testimonies, and the existence of conflicting positive ones.
781680	786320	It was particularly difficult to gather a consensus as to what Ellen's workplace was really like.
786320	792080	The most openly critical testimony was provided by an individual by the name of Surgical Strikes, or Dan Tobin,
792080	799040	which was posted in 2007 during the Writers Guild of America strike after Ellen questionably crossed the picket line to record her show.
799040	808640	Tobin shared anecdotes from when he worked for her on the mostly unsuccessful sitcom The Ellen Show, which depicted her as antagonistic and even derogatory towards her team.
808640	818320	He remarks how she openly expressed the desire to sack the head writer for the lack of quality content, while noting how he would later go on to create the legendary Arrested Development.
818320	824800	This post received ample amounts of media attention, but mostly faded when nobody else came forward to corroborate the claims.
824800	831520	Ellen would go on to indirectly respond to this account and other headlines spurred by anonymous testimonies in the 2018 interview,
831520	838160	where she dismissed them as an outright lie, emphasizing that workplace happiness is one of her utmost priorities.
838160	842080	With that in mind, what reason did we have to doubt her commitment?
842080	850560	Well, at the time of the interview, not much. I'm gonna save some of the other contents for later, but as it stood, one thing that was constantly harped on was the fact that Ellen was human.
850560	859440	In a way, I think many people knew that, yet even if we did, The Ellen DeGeneres Show had almost elevated the image of its host in a way that was asking for it to be knocked down.
859440	865520	However, the only way this was going to happen is if a consistent stream of people who had background with DeGeneres were to come forward,
865520	875200	and for the longest time, that just didn't look like it was going to happen. Yet, here we are today, which probably means one thing, it did.
875200	888560	The Ellen DeGeneres Show
888560	899600	For the most part, Ellen's 2019 went off without a hitch, but as the new decade beckoned, she found herself in a bit of hot water after her appearance at a baseball game with former US President George W. Bush,
899600	906760	where they seem to be sharing some exquisite banter. Some online didn't welcome this interaction, given Bush's rather notorious legacy,
906760	913200	which included the now highly contested invasion of Iraq. Ellen responded to this by appealing to her philosophy of kindness,
913200	920000	stating that this principle doesn't just extend to people who agree with her, this was meant with support from many celebrities in her comment section,
920000	922880	and also inspired a monologue on a subsequent episode.
922880	928800	But just because I don't agree with someone on everything doesn't mean that I'm not going to be friends with them. When I say be kind to one another,
928800	934960	I don't mean only the people that think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone. Doesn't matter.
934960	943120	Earlier in the year, she had received some mild criticism after hosting the comedian Kevin Hart. He had stood down from hosting the Oscars following the resurfacing of some older,
943120	949520	rather inappropriate, homophobic content. Now, personally, if he's grown from that situation, then I don't think it should be held against him,
949520	955160	and I do genuinely think that it's sad that he had to relinquish such a fantastic opportunity. At the same time,
955160	962200	Ellen's narrative that the upset or outrage was merely a case of malicious internet trolls may strike some as a little offbeat.
962200	970720	There are so many haters out there. Whatever's going on in the internet, don't pay attention to them. That's a small group of people being very, very loud.
970720	977400	We are a huge group of people who love you and want to see you host the Oscars. You know, the trolls are, and they do it,
977440	985960	and who knows who this person is or people who cares, and you can't let them destroy you, and they can't destroy you because you have too much talent.
985960	992280	No one can do that, and for them to stop you from your dream, from what you wanted to do and what you have a right to do,
992280	995120	what you should be doing, it's why they haven't found another host.
995120	1004000	Now, this may not seem like the most relevant incident to today's discourse, and anyone familiar with Ellen will know that her friendship with Bush and Hart pre-existed these situations.
1004000	1011720	However, it was an important reminder of the degree that our TV host Goodwill incorporated. Whether it was too far for some people was unimportant.
1011720	1019400	It wouldn't be Ellen if it was anything else, and you know what? Come 2020, we could all use a little bit of kindness towards one another.
1019400	1026560	With the bleak socio-political landscape draining the very fibre of our being, it was never a better time for Ellen's teachings to shine through.
1026560	1033000	However, rather than being the saving grace in a year full of letdowns, she became a key subject of the public's own disillusion.
1033040	1040240	Let's move to March then, and if you recall, I mentioned that to garner publicity, claims would need to be organised in a way that outlines a pattern of behaviour,
1040240	1047280	rather than just individual experiences. It was hard to see exactly how that would happen, but gold was struck when comedian Kevin T. Porter
1047280	1053880	decided to raise some money for charity through the rather unorthodox method of donating for every story shared about Ellen's cruelty.
1053880	1059560	The tweet announcing this quickly received hundreds, and eventually thousands of replies covering Ellen's alleged shenanigans.
1059600	1066560	These ranged from former fans whose opinion of Ellen had been spoiled following encounters with the TV personality, to eyewitness accounts of Ellen
1066560	1071240	transforming into a dragon, though unfortunately, there isn't any evidence to support that one.
1071240	1078520	However, there were a few select claims that stood out, and became rather popular on their own terms, one of which regarding Ellen's former head writer,
1078520	1085320	Karen Kilgoreth. The tweet here asserted that during the 2007 writers' strike, Kilgoreth had refused to cross the picket line,
1085320	1089240	and was subsequently dismissed from her role, with Ellen never speaking to her again.
1089240	1094960	Kilgoreth had actually made a statement expressing empathy for DeGeneres at the time for crossing the picket line,
1094960	1102360	so this would be a pretty damning story if true, and this is at least somewhat supported by Kilgoreth's own retelling of the instance.
1102360	1108040	You're in a position now where the show has decided to cross the picket line, and you said no.
1108040	1116200	Well, I didn't say anything. I had to go on strike. So we kind of all said goodbye, like, oh, this sucks. This is so weird. See you later.
1116200	1122200	And, you know, when I was talking to, like, my EPs were like, we'll call you, and it was all that kind of stuff.
1122200	1131320	And I don't think anybody was prepared for the kind of political action that was about to take place. Like, no one knew what was going on.
1131320	1132680	What happened?
1132680	1138440	Well, the Writers Guild found out that they were, our show was going to cross the picket line, and they went fucking berserk.
1138440	1146120	They were just like, they wanted to, like, they made sure that I was always at the center of the, like, at the strike gate.
1146120	1152440	It was really crazy. We just kind of became the eye of the storm in this weird way of, like, the show that's doing the worst thing.
1152440	1153560	Because there were other...
1153560	1154760	But you weren't working.
1154760	1160760	No, we were striking. We showed up every day. Like, that was the crazy part, is our show was mad at us,
1160760	1162840	because the Guild was mad at them.
1162840	1166200	What happened after that? With your relationship with her?
1166200	1173240	Oh, yeah, it was bad. So we got her to stay out the first day. So Karen Anderson and I both were talking to her, and we were just like, please trust us.
1173240	1175000	This is way worse than you think it is.
1175000	1175800	Right.
1175800	1182840	And so she stayed out the first day. She told them I'm not going to cross the picket line, and then that's when they swarmed her.
1182840	1183640	I mean, I don't actually...
1183640	1184840	The affiliates?
1184840	1185400	No, no, no.
1185400	1185960	WGA?
1185960	1188600	The, no, no, no. The production company.
1188600	1189240	Right, right.
1189240	1195800	The people that ran the show. I'm sure her people, like, all the bigwigs went in and were just like, uh, no, you're doing the show.
1195800	1201560	So she wasn't comfortable with it, but they basically convinced her, like, this is what you have to do.
1202280	1208200	And then that's kind of when the whole, like, we are union zealots story started getting floated.
1208200	1210280	And the next time after that, that I talked to her...
1210280	1211000	Who, your writers?
1211640	1214520	Yeah, like, all of us striking, which we had no fucking choice.
1214520	1220120	She was definitely guilted of, like, there's all these people that have jobs. You can't, you can't stop their paycheck.
1220120	1220520	Right.
1220520	1222280	You know, they put her in that weird position.
1223160	1230520	I think that the part that fell apart the worst was just that interpersonal connection of, like, nobody needed to be demonized.
1230520	1234440	Nobody needed to be, like, she's the one that's doing all this stuff.
1234440	1241800	At one point, there was a story in the National Enquirer that I was in about how Ellen had crossed the picket line.
1241800	1245080	There was, like, a picture of me on the strike line in the National Enquirer.
1245080	1246360	It was the weirdest thing.
1246360	1248840	And I never talked to anybody from the National Enquirer.
1248840	1250120	That's not a thing you do.
1250120	1255400	When you work on a show, you sign papers, confidentiality, and there was no story to tell.
1255400	1256120	We were on strike.
1256120	1258200	It was just, it was what it was.
1258200	1262840	And they, the people, the EPs and stuff found out and they thought I went to the press.
1263480	1267000	So it was things like that where it's like, you've known me for five years and you think,
1267000	1271320	you think I would go to the fucking National Enquirer to talk about this ridiculous situation.
1271880	1273240	It was all that kind of stuff.
1273240	1277720	By the time it was over, everyone was so estranged and everyone was so angry.
1277720	1281720	And those people had to work for four months on a talk show with no writers.
1281720	1284280	Like, they must have been stressed out of their minds.
1284280	1285880	I mean, it wasn't good.
1285880	1289560	I honestly felt like at that time, it was almost like an act of God.
1289560	1291160	It was like, I've been here for five years.
1291160	1292680	I've given my all.
1292680	1296360	This really weird thing has happened that would never happen in a million years.
1296360	1298280	It's just like this strange thing.
1298280	1298760	I'm out.
1299400	1300520	This is my chance to go.
1301160	1306520	And that's, and I just kind of wash my hands of it because it was just too, it was really painful.
1306520	1308600	Now, does this excuse Ellen's actions?
1308600	1309240	Not at all.
1309240	1313640	It's a situation where she could have afforded to think for herself, and she didn't by the sound of it.
1313640	1318760	The fact that someone sees contact with another individual altogether on the basis of a very difficult decision
1318760	1323640	does make me wonder where her priorities lie, but it's not an indictment of character that we would need.
1323640	1325960	However, we have plenty more stories to examine.
1325960	1330360	Some of these characterize her as excruciatingly petty, complaining over trivialities
1330360	1334840	and going as far to encourage the redundancy of those who had caused her inconveniences.
1334840	1340520	Others depict her as cold, distant, and even cruel, with statements from multiple people claiming to be,
1340520	1346280	or at least no employees on the show, with the common theme being that many were discouraged from even conversing with her,
1346280	1349560	with Ellen abiding by this principle pretty strictly as well.
1349560	1355240	The stories just kept piling up, many of which not the most positive, not that you'd expect it in a thread constructed
1355240	1357640	on the premise of sharing your worst Ellen experiences.
1357720	1364040	Additionally, the fact that exposing bad stories aids the support of a good cause may lead some to present circumstances
1364040	1366360	in a more negative light than they actually occurred.
1366360	1370520	Nonetheless, a good portion of these stories were hard to write off, some came with receipts,
1370520	1372920	and others came from seemingly credible sources.
1372920	1379960	However, they were all united by one thing, that the Ellen DeGeneres trademarked kindness was not as all-inclusive as proclaimed.
1379960	1385960	In fact, to many, it appeared to be a source of personal profit, a facade that was dropped as soon as there was nothing at stake.
1386040	1392040	However, as most of these tales hinged on third-party or anecdotal evidence, very little could prospectively come from it.
1392040	1397400	A bunch of people gossiping on Twitter isn't really enough to topple an established TV personality alone.
1397400	1403080	Nonetheless, social media can be an excellent gauge of how much meat is on the bone for a ravenous news outlet,
1403080	1407720	and I'm sure many became excited at the possibility of a headline which revealed the undermining of
1407720	1410920	personally promoted values by an otherwise revered public figure.
1410920	1417480	Even if she didn't notice this, Ellen's producers should have recognised the warning signs, and trod carefully on the eggshells before them.
1417480	1423480	With the incoming threat of COVID-19, the standards and conduct of all involved would be put to the test more than ever.
1423480	1427080	This was a time where kindness and care to those around you was desperately needed,
1427080	1431240	perhaps even to an unprecedented degree in the Ellen DeGeneres' show's lifespan,
1431240	1436280	and if they put a single foot wrong, they could easily be subject to some very sharp scrutiny,
1436280	1442600	which could permanently damage the image of a show that they love so much, and their precious, precious host.
1442600	1446600	The truth is that, if Ellen couldn't afford the currency of kindness to those around her,
1446600	1449560	then it wasn't a price that anyone else was prepared to pay.
1454280	1456280	Jesus, where the hell am I?
1466280	1477720	At the end of the previous part, I emphasised the significance of this viral threat.
1477720	1483560	It had already spawned a few articles, and sent a lot of previously unsuspecting eyes onto our daytime sweetheart.
1483560	1487240	As the pandemic loomed, and we were all advised to stay the hell away from each other,
1487240	1491880	there were a lot of question marks over the entertainment industry, and what this meant for shows like Ellen,
1491880	1497640	which relied on the personal interaction with a live audience, as well as all the employees whose jobs may be on the line.
1497640	1502760	At the same time, this concern went beyond the industry, it was likely felt by many people who watched Ellen,
1502760	1504440	and looked to her for guidance.
1504440	1508040	It was an emotional time for many, and Ellen needed to be sensitive to that.
1508040	1510840	How would she deal with this age of uncertainty?
1510840	1521000	Ellen DeGeneres-"I've always wanted to have this show as a distraction, as a break from whatever's going on out there that may be unpleasant,
1521000	1525560	so if you're feeling down, I want to lift you up. If you're feeling trapped, I want to set you free.
1525560	1529000	If you feel like you're going in the wrong direction, I want you to back that thing up."
1529000	1534760	A reassuring clip from home. The quintessential Ellen. What could possibly go wrong?
1534760	1542840	Ellen DeGeneres-"One thing that I've learned from being in quarantine is that people, this is like being in jail, is what it is.
1542840	1550120	It's mostly because I've been wearing the same clothes for 10 days, and everyone in here is gay. The jokes that I have."
1551880	1555880	Well, it seems the writers have gone on strike again, because that joke kinda sucked,
1555880	1561480	and it didn't go down particularly well with viewers either, with many tweeting out their dismay at various aspects of the joke.
1561480	1568280	Now, there are many angles you can gird it from, however, I think, once again, it just makes Ellen seem a bit out of touch with the state of the world.
1568280	1574600	The analogy doesn't really make much sense on concept, and it's shortcoming to only intensified by the focus on Ellen's woes,
1574600	1576920	which don't draw the most personal sympathy.
1577880	1582280	Ellen DeGeneres-"You know what movie wouldn't have worked during the quarantine? Home Alone."
1586280	1587480	You're killing it today, Ellen.
1587480	1593160	Now, with that said, it's a bad joke. It happens. At a time like this, it seems excessive to be angry.
1593160	1598600	Who knows the stress that Ellen or her staff may be under that clouded their judgement on the delivery of such a gag.
1598600	1601560	She would have to do a little worse than that to come under fire, wouldn't she?
1601640	1608520	Well, a week later, it was reported that many crew members of the Ellen DeGeneres show were frustrated at their treatment following the state of crisis.
1608520	1615000	As leaked by two anonymous sources, they'd been given little to no communication, and shown no concern by the show's executives.
1615000	1621640	Further to this, many were frustrated that the show had hired an outside, non-union tech company to record her home broadcast.
1621640	1628360	When employees did finally receive a response from producers over two weeks later, they were informed that their pay would be reduced by 60%,
1628360	1631240	to an amount that would be hardly sufficient for many workers.
1631560	1639080	Much of the workforce probably felt their future was up in the air, and the alleged ambiguous messaging from leadership likely didn't assuage these anxieties.
1639080	1643560	To wait for such difficult news can hardly be fair, and many were quick to point this out.
1643560	1651080	Provided this is true, can this be directly attributed to Ellen? Not entirely. She can't be expected to keep in touch with everyone who is working for her,
1651080	1657320	and I think that a majority of people can understand that. However, the problem that once more rears its ugly head is that contradiction.
1657320	1662280	The people who've given their all to keep a show running deserve to be kept in the loop above anyone else,
1662280	1669800	and whether that's Ellen's direct responsibility or not, people don't want to see her as being in a system that is antithetical to what she advocates for.
1669800	1677640	With this story, a new narrative began to emerge, one that didn't just accuse Ellen of hypocrisy on the basis of her principles, but of a greater double standard.
1677640	1683400	When dealing with fellow celebrities, Ellen made the most heartfelt appeals to the qualities of sympathy and decency.
1683400	1690360	After all, they are human like the rest of us. However, these standards appeared to be neglected when dealing with anyone outside the celebrity clique.
1690360	1697960	Some felt this way following the George W. Bush controversy, that there had always been this separate class of elite above the consequences of their own actions,
1697960	1706120	and that Ellen had since joined them. The contrast of a multi-millionaire in their mansion grumbling about lockdown while many employees' livelihoods were in jeopardy
1706120	1711400	was not a flattering portrait, and only served to highlight the us-and-them contrast.
1711640	1720440	Ellen- I wanted to start doing my new show as soon as possible, because it's really for people who are stuck at home, and especially my staff and crew,
1720440	1726760	I love them, I miss them, and the best thing I can do to support them is to keep the show on the air, so here we are.
1726760	1734840	However, this still wasn't the whole story, as clips began to surface which even threw the idea of Ellen's preferential treatment of celebrities into contention.
1734840	1742680	These could be quotes from people reflecting on their experience, such as Nikki's tutorials, who decide to address the show's hospitality on a Dutch talk show.
1764840	1783320	It seems there's even a hierarchy within the industry, and despite being applauded on air, her treatment elsewhere seemed less than stellar,
1783320	1787960	but that's just an account. What about direct clips? Well, there were those as well.
1787960	1791160	It's good to see you, happy belated birthday. When was your birthday?
1791160	1792680	It was October 4th.
1792680	1793400	October 4th.
1793400	1797880	This is Dakota Johnson, she is an actress, model, and friend of Ellen.
1797880	1805400	At the start of the interview, DeGeneres decides to jokingly take a jab at the fact that Johnson hadn't invited our gracious host to a birthday party.
1805400	1807720	However, there was a small hitch with that.
1808680	1811960	Actually, no, that's not the truth. Ellen, you were invited.
1811960	1819800	Last time I was on the show, last year, you gave me a bunch of s*** about not inviting you, but I didn't even know you wanted to be invited.
1819800	1822360	But I did invite you and you didn't come, so...
1822360	1823640	This time you invited me?
1823640	1824040	Yeah.
1824040	1824760	Are you sure?
1824760	1825400	Yeah.
1825400	1827000	How do you know? I don't think so.
1827000	1827960	Ask everybody.
1831240	1832680	Ask Jonathan, your producer.
1832680	1833880	Who said you were?
1833880	1835800	I was invited? Why didn't I go?
1836760	1837240	I don't know.
1838920	1839480	Was it?
1839480	1839800	Was it?
1840840	1841880	Oh, yeah, I had that thing.
1842600	1849240	In fact, at the time of Dakota's due, Ellen was occupied at a little baseball match with former president George W.
1849240	1849640	Bush.
1849640	1851640	Now, this exchange appeared to be in good humor.
1851640	1858200	However, the circumstances surrounding it prompted many to return to it, especially relevance to how disconnected Ellen is portrayed to be.
1858200	1865400	Other clips were even more incriminating, such as a now rather infamous scene with Mariah Carey, where to ascertain whether she's pregnant with a child,
1865400	1870920	Ellen decides to offer the singer an alcoholic beverage, something that anyone expecting a child would wish to avoid.
1870920	1877640	I'll also add for further context that Carey suffered a miscarriage following this interview, which really does not age it well at all.
1877640	1884440	And then the other thing is that people are saying that, uh, that you're pregnant.
1884440	1885320	There's rumors.
1885320	1886280	Don't discuss that.
1886280	1887720	Um, all right.
1887720	1888360	Well, you don't have to.
1888360	1889080	No, that's okay.
1889080	1892120	No, honestly, let's just toast with champagne and decide.
1892120	1899000	It's just fattening.
1899960	1902440	No, let's toast to you not being pregnant.
1902440	1903320	If you're not pregnant.
1903320	1904760	Oh, my goodness.
1906440	1907640	I can't believe that.
1912760	1916200	How about to the future for both of our futures?
1916200	1917720	Who knows what they hold?
1917720	1918200	Who knows?
1918760	1919560	All right, go ahead.
1919560	1920440	Okay, cheers.
1920440	1920920	Cheers.
1920920	1922280	It's too early for me.
1922280	1925320	I only drink it after 3 p.m.
1925320	1925560	Yeah.
1933000	1939800	As a concept for a lowbrow gag, it may have been mildly amusing, and at first I actually thought it was far too personal to not be staged.
1939800	1945400	However, Carey would later go on to say that the interrogation made her rather uncomfortable, and when you take this into account,
1945400	1947480	it's hard to look upon Ellen favorably.
1947480	1954840	Even if this wasn't her idea, she should have recognized and respected the discretion of her guest, and not fallen foul to such tabloid treachery.
1955480	1956600	I have my own dog.
1956600	1958920	Actually, she's pregnant, too.
1958920	1959800	I have two dogs.
1959800	1961160	Well, her master isn't.
1961640	1962600	Her master is.
1962600	1965320	Well, let me take some of the vodka next to me.
1966280	1967160	Why aren't you answering?
1967160	1972120	Ellen did that to me and tried to put me on the spot with some alcohol.
1972120	1975400	Okay, I'm not trying to put you on the spot.
1975480	1976760	It's nice if you are.
1978120	1984920	As these clips began to be collated outside the other documented claims, some began to search for an explanation for such conduct.
1984920	1987720	Was she out of touch or out of care?
1987720	1991480	Well, with more allegations to come, let's talk about it.
1991480	2005560	With the gradually mounting agglomeration of content, there was little doubt that something here was not quite right.
2005560	2011640	However, at the same time, there was a divergence in the theories that many adopted when attempting to assess Ellen's actions.
2011640	2018120	On one hand, some believe that much of this illustrated a celebrity who had simply forgotten what it was like to live in the real world,
2018120	2021800	and thus had become insensitive to the needs of many of those she claimed to care about.
2021800	2025960	To be honest, many of the rich and famous likely suffer from a lack of relatability.
2025960	2030120	However, their careers don't rely on connecting to an audience in the same way that Ellen's does.
2030120	2031480	Are you fans of the show?
2031480	2031920	Correct?
2031920	2032120	Yeah.
2036520	2039640	And you watch the show regularly.
2044520	2045080	Great.
2045160	2050200	One of those who subscribed to this school of thought was a former producer from the Ellen DeGeneres show.
2050200	2057160	Speaking anonymously in an article published in the New York Post, they recounted the time Ellen couldn't read a text after losing her glasses,
2057160	2063400	and decided that the reasonable response would be to phone Steve Jobs up and inform him that the iPhone should have a bigger font.
2063400	2070120	They say that's Ellen, and that she's not some demon, just a person who's been living in a privileged bubble for way too long.
2070200	2077640	This doesn't seem like an absurd point of view, and would perhaps explain some of the supposed rather petty behaviours as claimed by others.
2077640	2084440	In focusing on her role as a host, Ellen may have been isolated from many that she works with, either by her own decision,
2084440	2088360	or through corporate design, something that I'll probably talk about in due course.
2088360	2094920	Some who had worked with Ellen previously stating they had an overall positive experience, such as the former head writer Karen Kilgoriff,
2094920	2099640	appeared to have their relationship cut short pretty abruptly when a conflict of interest arose.
2099640	2105960	In Karen's interest, she was clearly hesitant to characterise Ellen as the source of this falling out, especially with the attested corporate meddling.
2105960	2111400	However, others would not be as charitable, and have a more damning verdict on our celebutant chum.
2111400	2118200	Where some may stop short of characterising our leading lady as malicious, others would venture with far less trepidation,
2118200	2122600	particularly with some of the more incriminating testimonies and clips on display.
2122600	2128680	Karen Kilgoriff-"And then you had a very tough time. You couldn't get a job? What was that like?"
2128680	2136440	Karen Kilgoriff-"Not only couldn't get a job, couldn't get someone on a phone. I mean, they're literally, you know, the show was cancelled, and no one called me.
2136440	2146360	It was just, I found out my assistant read it in the paper. And, you know, I felt sorry for myself. I felt like this isn't fair.
2146360	2153960	I thought people liked me, and why did this change anything? And I still am the same person, and you know, everything felt horrible to me."
2154040	2159320	Ellen is a TV veteran, and someone who has had more than ample experience with the worst of the industry.
2159320	2164920	However, although that makes her ascension of the hierarchy highly respectable, it also makes the selective application,
2164920	2168680	and even outright neglect of certain responsibilities, harder to defend.
2168680	2173000	With some personages, you can use ignorance as a way to explain certain blunders.
2173000	2179640	Even if you personally believe they have a duty to be aware of the consequences their actions have, it may make sense they lose sight of this.
2179640	2186520	With Ellen, simply put, it seemed much harder to believe, with many coming to the conclusion that she must have been aware of these injustices,
2186520	2189000	but had made the conscious decision to not care.
2189000	2194440	Some would go further than this, though, to say that she may even take pleasure in the subjugation of those around her,
2194440	2197960	partaking in excessively cruel and sadistic behaviour.
2197960	2203640	This falls in line with many of the more unforgiving stories regarding her conduct, and is not to be discounted either.
2203640	2210200	Another person who would come out to support this in the month following was a bodyguard who escorted Ellen at the 2014 Academy Awards.
2210200	2213960	He stated that although his experience with Ellen's wife, Portia, was rather positive,
2213960	2218040	this went downhill quickly when he met Ellen, who barely even made eye contact with him,
2218040	2221960	and radiated this aura of frigidity that bothered the chaperone in question.
2221960	2229000	He summarises his thoughts by saying that it's kind of demeaning in the way that she treats people other than those who are in her circle.
2229240	2235080	Now, both of these aforementioned positions have their advocates, and cases which seem to argue against,
2235080	2239320	even people who claim that a lot of what was being said was completely fabricated.
2239320	2245560	However, this criticism was not relenting, with many more people jumping in to discuss their brushes with the embattled icon.
2245560	2249240	Yet, in spite of this, all remained mostly quiet on Ellen's social medias.
2249240	2255160	Addressing drama is normally not a positive process, whether it's the right thing to do or not, so she kept pushing on,
2255160	2258840	but insider reports kept spilling that these allegations had affected her,
2258840	2262920	and it was hard to deny that she must be somewhat aware of what was being said.
2262920	2271160	Now, generally, the rule for a lot of public figures is to avoid punching down onto claims that may not necessarily have the substantiation to merit a response.
2271160	2276280	However, with leaks and rumours reaching fever pitch, it felt like the programme was at breaking point.
2276280	2285080	Rumourings were being constantly released to the press, who promoted it to the awaiting public in a vicious cycle that was gradually eroding away at the show and its host's stature.
2285320	2291640	At the start of July, the word began to spread that the Ellen DeGeneres show may be cancelled altogether because of the imputations,
2291640	2296600	and although the production company behind Ellen dismissed this as speculation, unsurprisingly so,
2296600	2301960	with what happened in the coming weeks, they may have wished they had, because on Thursday the 16th of July,
2301960	2308200	a damning dossier was published, which called out the toxic workplace environment behind the award-winning production.
2308200	2316600	It outlined unfair dismissals, discrimination, favouritism, and neglect of responsibilities typically expected of a show with such moral grounding.
2316600	2322280	Yes, one current and ten former employees painted the workplace culture as one ruled by fear,
2322280	2332600	with most of the blame being placed at the door of the producers, who had distanced DeGeneres and validated an environment that marginalised vulnerable individuals who needed support above anything else.
2332600	2338040	In some ways, a lot of what was detailed wasn't any more incriminating than previous testimonies published,
2338040	2345000	and this was much less focused on Ellen, but for some reason, this article cut deeper, maybe it was the cumulative batch alongside other content,
2345000	2349400	maybe it was the socially charged narratives that had become ever more relevant in recent months,
2349400	2357960	but for me, once more, it was the organisation of a slew of stirring stories, posted in a credible, well, moderately credible news output.
2357960	2363560	In the article, the executive producers, who are the subject of a lot of the criticism, express shock at the allegations,
2363560	2369640	pledging their commitment to a safe and friendly workspace for all, they seek to accept full culpability for the misconduct listed,
2369640	2375480	attempting to take attention away from Ellen. In many ways, this wasn't her story, but once more, at the start of the article,
2375480	2382600	there was this emphasis on Ellen's narrative of being kind, effectively being used to contrast with the coming content.
2382600	2389800	This wasn't just any workplace, this was Ellen's workplace, and if she was as kind as she was perceived, silence was no longer an option,
2389880	2395160	yet speaking out was a costly obligation all the same. Allow me to explain.
2405640	2413640	Let's pull it back to Ellen as a person, and Ellen as a show. In many ways, they are separate entities, but the fact that the latter is built on the former
2413640	2419080	means that no matter what the producers asserted, this was as much Ellen's problem as it was anyone else's.
2419080	2426440	As one of the staff members said, if she wants to have her own show and have her name on the show title, she needs to be more involved to see what's going on.
2426440	2433000	One of the greatest problems with this industry is that there's often this separation between individual hosts and the productions behind them.
2433000	2440680	That seems easy to forget as an audience member, but it is understandable when the host has a more passive role such as in certain reality programs,
2440680	2450440	or televised talent contests, and even then, in many ways, as an anchor to the experience, a presenter can't expect to be focused on controlling every aspect behind the scenes.
2450440	2456920	However, this was reaching a point where Ellen's neutrality would be seen as a tasked endorsement of an undesirable status quo.
2456920	2462240	The allegations were well founded, and so she needed to say something. Before she could say anything, though,
2462240	2468200	Warner Bros stepped in to launch their own exhaustive internal investigation, which would determine the source of the problem.
2468200	2475080	On July 27th, Variety reported that a memo had been sent out to staff members the week before, announcing the upcoming audit,
2475080	2479400	with the consultation of a third-party organization and an employee relations group.
2479400	2484160	Interviews were held, and circumstances were assessed, and three days after the initial story was published,
2484160	2488000	Warner Bros released a statement on the findings of their assessment, revealing quote,
2488000	2493080	deficiencies in the workplace environment, while also signifying that changes would be made.
2493160	2498480	This was a statement made both on behalf of the company and DeGeneres, which probably wasn't the best call,
2498480	2504440	but it seems that Ellen had distributed her own separate statement to the staff, where she communicated remorse for her failure
2504440	2510960	to stay conscious to oversights and shortcomings, vowing to make sure that a repeat of such antics would be avoided at all costs.
2510960	2516000	This statement was once more picked up by the press, who framed it as Ellen finally breaking her silence.
2516000	2523000	However, it was mostly an internal acknowledgement of failings only provoked by the report prior, and doesn't really mention much else.
2523040	2527160	Not that you'd expect it to, but it's hardly what some online represented it as.
2527160	2533960	Nonetheless, Ellen's statement was enough to begin a strange chain reaction that would take this ongoing controversy to new heights.
2533960	2538120	You see, although the promise of a more secure work environment may have appeased some employees,
2538120	2545000	those not directly affected appeared reluctant to accept her apology, likely because many felt that her angle was mostly adopted
2545000	2551240	for the sake of damage control, rather than actual regrets. As a response to the specific accusations levelled against her,
2551240	2556480	many felt this merely added further weight to the belief that she was just another self-interested social vulture,
2556480	2559800	and this time, it wasn't just the internet revel who were paying attention.
2559800	2563360	In fact, Ellen's statement attracted the eyes of some pretty notable figures.
2563360	2568840	One of those who left his input very shortly after the coverage by journalists was the esteemed voice actor Brad Garrett,
2568840	2574000	who had appeared on Ellen's show during the 2000s. However, it appears that any camaraderie had since faded,
2574000	2579000	as he laid into the talk show host pretty harshly, commenting in a now-deleted tweet that it was
2579000	2583800	common knowledge that Ellen had mistreated her staff, while also claiming to know a few personally.
2583800	2589960	This was then reported on by websites, one article prompting a reply from Back to the Future star Leah Thompson,
2589960	2593720	appearing to affirm Garrett's postulations with her best Yoda impression.
2593720	2598120	Around the same time, Australian radio host Neil Breen, no, not that Neil Breen,
2598120	2602200	recollected the time he had worked as a producer on a show that interviewed Ellen,
2602200	2607720	the numerous restrictions that the production team had imposed on them, and the subsequent atmosphere that yielded.
2607720	2614280	Well, when Ellen, the generous came to Australia to do her show in 2013, I was the executive producer of the Today Show.
2614280	2618320	So we partnered with them that she was brought out here by Swiss,
2618320	2623480	the vitamin company who was sponsoring the whole thing, and originally she was going to co-host the Today Show.
2623480	2627520	Then she was going to do this, this was going to do and the whole thing got watered down to Ellen.
2627520	2630600	The generous would do a sit down interview, right?
2630600	2637680	We took the whole Today Show to Melbourne at our expense, but she would do a sit down interview with Richard Wilkins.
2637680	2643480	We walk in and then the Ellen Show producer, there was a lot of them, there was a lot of people there.
2643480	2648880	Anyway, the producers called us aside and said, okay, this is how it's going to work here this morning.
2648880	2656880	Ellen's going to arrive at, you know, 10.15 and she'll be sitting in this chair here and Richard, you'll be sitting in this chair here.
2656880	2660720	Now, Neil, no one's to talk to Ellen.
2660720	2666240	So you don't talk to her, you don't approach her, you don't look at her, she'll come in, she'll sit down, she'll talk to Richard,
2666280	2669960	then Ellen will leave and we'll give you the thing.
2669960	2672680	And I sort of said, are you fair dinkum?
2672680	2674640	Oh, I can't look at her.
2674640	2676600	I found the whole thing bizarre.
2676600	2680880	Anyway, I've got to tell you, I'm not blaming Ellen because I didn't get to talk to her because I wasn't allowed to.
2680880	2683680	So I don't know whether she's a nice person or not, I wouldn't have a clue.
2683680	2690880	But I can tell you, the people who worked with her walked on eggshells the whole time and the whole thing was totally bizarre.
2690880	2694800	Like, we're there to do an interview with her to promote what she's doing.
2694840	2697920	But you can't look at her like someone get real.
2697920	2702000	In case it couldn't get any worse, around the time she was being publicly chastised,
2702000	2708040	further allegations made towards producers regarding inappropriate advances, actions and comments towards employees,
2708040	2714440	which include the invitation to provide one of our venerated executives with a hand job and even the occasional group here and there.
2714440	2720320	The main recipient of these allegations was producer Kevin Lemon, who many said veiled his conduct in sarcasm,
2720320	2723320	yet carried it out in the most predatory fashion.
2723360	2727720	There were also allegations which covered two other producers, Jonathan Norman and Ed Glavin.
2727720	2734440	This was corroborated by many other former employees and seemed to incriminate other producers who didn't take action against such behavior.
2734440	2738800	DeGeneres' own role is not explicitly spoken about, but as with previous instances,
2738800	2744000	it brings her position into question as a person whose environment should reflect her own values.
2744000	2748480	With these further contributions, it seemed that Ellen's reputation was practically in the gutter,
2748480	2752680	and with ratings in freefall being at least partly attributed to the ongoing outcry,
2752720	2754800	reprise seemed to be a distant dream.
2754800	2757160	You can't exactly be surprised, though, after all,
2757160	2763440	whether Ellen was an actively malicious actor or a distant celebrity no longer close to the inner workings of their own product,
2763440	2766360	it was undermining her own appeal, and as it stood,
2766360	2771560	these were the only two explanations that made sense of the situation, and neither made her look good.
2771560	2776920	However, as the walls were caving in, it seemed that Ellen may have one last shot at redemption,
2776920	2782440	coming from those most familiar with her, fellow celebrities who wanted to present a third perspective.
2782640	2784160	One much more sympathetic.
2784720	2790040	We're back with Katy Perry, and you're about to go on tour, and you are...
2790040	2790720	September.
2790720	2793040	You are single, and...
2793040	2794160	Ready to mingle!
2794160	2794680	Ready?
2795280	2800240	From the initial post by Kevin T. Porter, there had always been those who had spoken up for our besieged heroine,
2800240	2806040	telling of the genuinely positive experiences with her, and although it obviously doesn't represent a universal outlook,
2806040	2811680	the fact that a fair few of these testimonies were going against the Twitter grain made them seem more authentic in a way.
2811800	2816960	However, they had mostly been isolated and dismissed given their relatively faint presence in a sea of criticism.
2816960	2819320	With August, however, this was about to change.
2819320	2824720	As many had shared their negative experiences, public figures came out in droves to share their positive ones,
2824720	2828520	music producers, award-winning actors, comedians, and many more.
2828520	2830720	Their stories told a different narrative.
2830720	2835440	Sure, there may be rumors circulating, but the experience they had with Ellen was invaluable,
2835440	2838880	and she has done so many fantastic things for so many people.
2838880	2843320	She may not be perfect, but surely, whatever she was enduring right now wasn't fair.
2843320	2848000	She had brought much more light to this world than many others, and to oust her on the back of hearsay?
2848000	2850120	Well, that's just ludicrous.
2850120	2855200	The internet is a place full of negativity and stigmatization, and in a year like this,
2855200	2859520	it was time to take a step back and remember what people like Ellen really gave us.
2859520	2865000	A heartwarming sentiment, for sure, but was it enough to dig Ellen out of the hole she had found herself in?
2865000	2867000	Well, let's talk about it.
2868880	2881920	Chapter 3- The
2881920	2884320	Attestation
2884320	2889200	With the attestations coming from many household names, this third narrative began to gather steam.
2889200	2895000	There were so many people paying tribute to Ellen's character, many of whom would have significant personal background with her.
2895040	2899800	Maybe online toxicity had overcome us, and it was time to look at the bigger picture.
2899800	2903280	Some clearly agreed with this and echoed the sentiment on their timeline.
2903280	2908760	After all, Ellen had done much more for communities than many of those internet dwellers throwing secondhand shade.
2908760	2914320	However, at the same time, the celebrity narrative didn't exonerate Ellen in the way that one may have poked.
2914320	2918760	In fact, for some, it actually solidified more cynical theories relating to her demeanor.
2918760	2923440	Why is that? Well, let's think back to the initial instance, and what many allege they told us.
2925000	2939160	For many, it felt like Ellen provided preferential treatment to those in her elite circles, and had a tendency to shun those outside of that.
2939160	2944480	Therefore, it was completely plausible that those most likely to vouch for her were those in the elite circle.
2944480	2951360	Now, with that in mind, there are plenty of appeals to the greater positive effect that Ellen has generated beyond those who have direct experience with her,
2951360	2955280	given her records in fighting for human rights, animal rights, and many more.
2955280	2960360	This is all well and good, but it doesn't really dispel the main points against the TV personality.
2960360	2965280	From a social perspective, Ellen may have left a net positive impact on the world around her.
2965280	2970760	I'm sure there are many people that her feel-good spirit has touched and inspired on a day-to-day basis.
2970760	2975480	Equally, I'm sure there are many people who have been aided by charitable ventures and philanthropy,
2975480	2983480	but the moment that we let someone's net positive impact absolve them of all possible criticism is the time when our fundamental ability to think critically has failed.
2983480	2988240	Sure, there may be some points where appealing to a greater impact as a public figure is a valid response,
2988240	2995120	but responding to people sharing negative experiences and indictments on workplace toxicity doesn't fulfil this criteria.
2995120	3000920	A lot of these statements just feel like Ellen messaged the celebrity Twitter group chat asking people to vouch for her,
3000920	3006440	because it doesn't seem like any of these people actually have a clue who they're responding to or what's even happening,
3006440	3012520	and the fact that these posts were made a few days after the further impropriety allegations just makes them seem even more clueless.
3012520	3018040	At the end of the day, I'm sure we're all happy that people had a positive experience with someone who they greatly admired,
3018040	3023760	but this didn't alter what was happening elsewhere, and how many wanted more than just people saying she's nice.
3023800	3031640	Trust me, this sense of divide wasn't aided when former Ellen DJ Tony Okonboa commented that he personally stood with his fellow colleagues,
3031640	3036680	and had also experienced some of the reported toxicity in his decades shy stint on the show.
3036680	3043800	There was one glimpse of hope for Ellen on a more personal basis though, as Samantha Ronson, a person who has worked with Ellen on more than a few occasions,
3043800	3049560	came out in support of the under fire TV host, saying that her experiences as an employee have been positive,
3049560	3052720	creating at least some diversity from outside the celebrity clique.
3052760	3060440	The current DJ Stephen Boss or Twitch had left a mostly ambiguous comment to the media, observing that in spite of the difficulties,
3060440	3067480	there was love. However, that love was clearly not present with three of the producers who in the next week were all fired by Warner Bros.
3067480	3072120	These individuals had been placed under the microscope following the allegations we discussed previously,
3072120	3076800	and it's clear that the parent company had viewed the allegations with the gravitas that they warranted,
3076800	3079120	or at least their media implications warranted.
3079480	3084080	Two of the three producers had pleaded their innocence previously, denying the claims made against them,
3084080	3090040	and as this was an internal investigation, it's hard to really comment on the reliability of what was being testified,
3090040	3093360	though given the volume of the claims, it is hard to dismiss.
3093360	3096160	Now, with that said, I think their fates were sealed regardless.
3096160	3103800	The whirlwind of media chaos whipped up had already given the corporate bigwigs a headache that was likely shortening their patience with the show's production team,
3103800	3108720	and to keep on the producers after such widely endorsed claims had surfaced would have been bad news for them.
3108800	3115520	In more ways than one, at the end of the day, they can be replaced with people who will hopefully land the corporation in less hot water.
3115520	3120920	The truth is, there's only one person behind the show who's ostensibly indispensable, and that's Ellen.
3120920	3126760	Therefore, the priority will be to keep her image as clean as possible, at all costs.
3126760	3131200	Now, they had mostly failed in this task in the months preceding, however, there wasn't much they could do,
3131200	3137800	the only person who could defend Ellen was Ellen, but at the same time, by doing so, she'd be opening up a can of worms.
3137880	3141880	Unfortunately, the worms escaped regardless, and had a lot of dirt.
3141880	3150280	The celebrity support should have at least provided her with some form of consolation, but in fact, it partially played into the aspersions espoused by her detractors.
3150280	3156880	It brought more attention to an unresolved issue which the company took seriously enough to sack three of their executive staff members,
3156880	3162680	and a load of rich people dismissing much of the online outrage as people spreading rumors was incredibly ill-timed,
3162720	3165440	particularly given the eventual outcome of the investigation.
3165440	3171640	Once the departure of their senior level staff was announced, Ellen went on a call to discuss it further with present employees,
3171640	3178480	where she is alleged to have contested certain claims about her character, such as those that asserted she did want people to make eye contact with her,
3178480	3184400	an assertion that she branded as false. As well as this, she reaffirmed her commitment to being much more active behind the scenes,
3184400	3192000	and not just being an on-screen persona, which is good. However, as she had likely realized now, this wasn't just about her employees,
3192000	3197840	this was a public issue where the inner workings of an otherwise beloved daytime program had been exposed,
3197840	3205520	and she had to be the one to put it right. In many ways, the sympathetic explanation of this predicament that we discussed at the start of this part
3205520	3210640	was still not out of the question, but some judgments can't come from third-party testimony alone.
3210640	3218320	Anyone can vouch for another person, but sometimes that person has to speak for themselves and let people judge them on the basis of their own sincerity.
3218320	3226440	This wasn't a situation where lawyers, producers, managers, or celebrities could speak on Ellen's behalf, this was a wrong that she had to write.
3226440	3232280	Ellen built a career on the back of kindness, a sentiment that when fabricated, people do not take lightly.
3232280	3238840	The question was whether Ellen was a woman of her word, and at this point, we didn't even know what her word was.
3238840	3244840	Now, when I spoke about the record low ratings on the Ellen DeGeneres show being partially attributed to controversy,
3244880	3251640	you may wonder what the other reasons were. Well, simply put, they were reruns, and reruns will inevitably draw less viewers,
3251640	3258280	as some have already watched the episodes being aired. Nonetheless, a new season was around the corner, and that meant a fresh start,
3258280	3262360	but you can't really start over until you bring this saga to an end.
3262360	3268160	Over the last few months, Ellen's reputation had been a living nightmare with many substantiated claims against her,
3268160	3273160	and as she had slowly transformed into this internet caricature, with not even an attempt to defend herself,
3273160	3278840	it felt like she was losing grip on what she even stood for, but she still had one thing, her show,
3278840	3284640	and that means she still had one more chance to redefine her values. Would she take that chance?
3284640	3287400	Well, she would have to dig deep.
3287400	3291240	Oh boy, welcome to season 18 of the Ellen DeGeneres show.
3304000	3310080	September the 21st, 2020, the 18th season of the Ellen DeGeneres show was brace release.
3310080	3315520	Its journey onto the screen, although not free from obstacles, had likely led many involved to a better place.
3315520	3320680	DJ Stephen Boss was also now an executive producer, so hopefully he would bring some of his signature love,
3320680	3325600	and all in all, it had made those responsible more committed to a supportive structure for employees.
3325600	3328880	I think we can all agree that this can be considered a broad positive.
3328880	3331320	However, it was always greater than this show.
3331320	3336840	It was about the person at the center, and that individual still had many devotees and detractors alike,
3336840	3342240	waiting for her to tackle what had cast a great shadow over her throughout this tumultuous year.
3342240	3346840	In a way, this wasn't just for her, but for everyone who had looked up to her over the years,
3346840	3350640	an overt renewal of a doctrine that had been taken for granted previously.
3350640	3353520	This time, she had to mean it. How did she fare?
3353920	3359240	As you may have heard, this summer there were allegations of a toxic work environment at our show,
3359240	3361160	and then there was an investigation.
3361160	3364320	I learned that things happened here that never should have happened.
3364320	3368800	I take that very seriously, and I want to say I am so sorry to the people who were affected.
3368800	3373880	I know that I'm in a position of privilege and power, and I realize that with that comes responsibility,
3373880	3377280	and I take responsibility for what happens at my show.
3377280	3383400	We have had a lot of conversations over the last few weeks about the show, our workplace, and what we want for the future.
3383480	3387520	We have made the necessary changes, and today we are starting a new chapter.
3387520	3393120	Well, the apology is quite brief in the context of the show, and mostly addresses claims in their general state.
3393120	3398320	As shown in the clip previously, she discusses the office environment and accepts responsibility for misconduct
3398320	3399800	that occurred under her nose.
3399800	3405000	In fact, this part is all executed reasonably well, with Ellen reiterating the need for a fresh start.
3405000	3409720	However, we then reach the crux of a lot of people's issues, Ellen's own character,
3409760	3417400	something which the TV host should know better than anyone else, and her apology slash apologia is certainly a sight to behold.
3417400	3423520	There are also articles in the press and on social media that said that I am not who I appear to be on TV,
3423520	3426520	because I became known as the Be Kind Lady.
3426520	3429760	The truth is, I am that person that you see on TV.
3429760	3431680	I am also a lot of other things.
3431680	3437240	I sometimes I get sad, I get mad, I get anxious, I get frustrated, I get impatient.
3437240	3444040	I am a work in progress, and I'm especially working on the impatience thing because it's not going well.
3444040	3450720	In her monologue, she once more avoids specific details, opting instead to confront the general sentiment behind the allegations,
3450720	3454000	and the message that many within the press were using the stories to push.
3454000	3461120	She calls upon her humanity and her imperfections, and concedes that she isn't perfect, but is working every day to improve it.
3461120	3463200	A very noble ethos indeed.
3463200	3469920	She finishes by having a discussion with the new producer, Twitch, and using it as a vehicle to convey that sense of progress.
3469920	3479400	You know, the song was a little crazy, it was intense, but during that time, there's been a lot of learning, a lot of discussions, a lot of listening.
3479400	3488160	You and I have had numerous discussions, and for me, I'm just so excited to be back here in the studio so we can do what we do best,
3488160	3495760	which is bring laughter, love, and fun, right? And also lead by example by putting our best foot forward after a bounce back, right?
3495760	3498040	So it's all love. I'm so excited for this season.
3498040	3501880	It's all love. That's all that's real is love. That's the truth.
3501880	3511920	After this delightful speech, Ellen moved on. I mean, she moved on to the next segment of her show, which I'll assume is hilarious comedy and trademark Ellen-generous hijinks.
3511920	3514200	Thank goodness it was all over.
3514800	3519840	Yet for many people, it wasn't over. In fact, the reception on the subsequent YouTube upload was not the warmest,
3519840	3525320	with the like-dislike ratios indicating a widespread rejection of Ellen's return and subsequent declamation.
3525320	3529720	Most comments and video responses were tinged by a clear doubt in her integrity.
3529720	3537200	After all, with such plentiful allegations, you cannot easily brush it aside in the space of five minutes with a I'm not perfect, so what narrative.
3537600	3543960	I always try to grow as a person. I look at everything that comes into my life as an opportunity to learn.
3543960	3548960	I got into this business to make people laugh and feel good. That's that's my favorite thing to do.
3548960	3555760	And now I am a boss of 270 people, 270 people who helped make this show what it is.
3555760	3563720	Two hundred seventy people. I am so grateful for.
3563760	3568760	All I want is for every single one of them to be happy and to be proud to work here.
3568760	3575800	However, what did I think? Well, after going through the whole situation, this video struck a weird chord for sure.
3575800	3580840	It is brief. The humor interspersed with these serious apologies feels a bit awkward.
3580840	3589080	The laugh tracks aren't necessary, and they carry on cutting back to Twitch clapping at very unprompted points like Ellen just ended racism,
3589120	3593960	and also talks about what's going on in the world, which, although not necessarily used as a point of defense,
3593960	3598840	can feel like it's trying to detract from the allegations, which isn't what you really desire from this sort of video.
3598840	3607360	At the same time, I feel like as Ellen's super fans go, they will be won over by this explanation, and to be fair, I can't exactly blame them for that.
3607360	3614480	My hope is that we can still be a place of happiness and joy. I still want to be the one hour a day that people can go to escape and laugh.
3614720	3621240	I want to continue to help all the people that we help every day, and I'm committed to making this the best season that we have ever had.
3621240	3628400	When I spoke about the celebrity elite earlier, I mentioned how, in many ways, a lot of their comments were irrelevant to the charges brought against her,
3628400	3632680	because the greater character implications only followed from specific instance.
3632680	3638160	Here, Ellen doesn't address the specific instance, and that will understandably frustrate viewers.
3638160	3645920	At the same time, she deals with them in a way that does umbrella the allegations, and seek to explain them through the lens that the be kind narrative
3645920	3651760	is obviously not always the most beneficial to her image, as it's not always something she can commit to.
3651760	3658080	She is not perfect, and this seeks to tackle the underlying insinuations behind other claims.
3658080	3664440	Being known as the be kind lady is a tricky position to be in, so let me give you some advice out there.
3664440	3669200	Anybody's thinking of changing their title, or giving yourself a nickname, do not go with the be kind lady.
3670400	3671640	Don't do it.
3671640	3677680	This is where it becomes even more complicated, and I would like to reintroduce the previous explanations for her behavior,
3677680	3680120	the more cynical and the more sympathetic.
3680120	3686000	With commentators and critics alike, many have began to work off the assumption that Ellen was this bad person,
3686000	3691640	a tyrant who treated her employees terribly, and therefore, of course, this speech would not win them over,
3691680	3697560	because the only way to really undermine that rather unforgiving narrative would be if Ellen directly responded to,
3697560	3702560	and debunked each and every more austere allegation, that was simply not going to happen.
3702560	3706880	In a way, we have been blessed by comprehensive responses from YouTubers in the past,
3706880	3711520	because the allegations often feel more personal to them, and they want to clear themselves,
3711520	3714640	but it's not something that translates across to other industries.
3714640	3721160	Ellen wasn't going to release a 40 minute tell all response to each individual claim with some ambiguous lowercase title,
3721200	3722920	not if she didn't feel like she needed to.
3722920	3726400	No, her responses take cues from both the other two explanations.
3726400	3731520	On one hand, she clearly was out of touch, and she should be more involved in the well being of those around her.
3731520	3734600	She had become distant from what she had previously found affinity with.
3734600	3739960	At the same time, she is human and will have bad days where people may not see the best side of her.
3739960	3750240	I've played a straight woman in movies, so I'm a pretty good actress, but I don't think that I'm that good that I could come out here every day for 17 years and fool you.
3750760	3751560	This is me.
3751880	3756760	If people were more inclined to show leniency towards Ellen, people like her supporters,
3756760	3759360	then I think they may well buy this explanation.
3759360	3764240	Ellen appeals to those fans when she talks about her time on the show, how they should know her.
3764240	3767160	This is not directed at those who already dislike her.
3767160	3772480	This is for people who are going to be responsive, who have stuck around, who have seen what Ellen has done.
3772480	3775280	After all, whether people choose to forgive her or not,
3775320	3780240	those who were not Ellen enthusiasts before are unlikely to become Ellen enthusiasts after,
3780240	3785600	and if Ellen transformed the show into one elongated response, she would only hemorrhage more viewers.
3785600	3790840	This was an appeal to people who knew her, who knew who the real Ellen was.
3790840	3792240	But was it enough?
3792640	3793240	Really?
3793920	3796120	Who was the real Ellen?
3805280	3812080	Over the next month following the response, and leading up to the time of writing this script,
3812080	3816600	Ellen's show has found some semblance of stability, however, ratings have been down,
3816600	3819760	and that has been unsurprisingly picked up by many outlets.
3819760	3824640	With the current circumstances changing the world as we know it, it's hard to tell if this is permanent,
3824640	3828680	but it will certainly foster some disquietude amongst the corporate honchos.
3828680	3832680	All right, Guillermo, you have to go down. It's gonna be good. You're going down, Guillermo.
3832680	3833680	All right.
3834280	3835120	Don't worry, Guillermo.
3836800	3837520	How was that?
3838000	3838800	Terrible.
3838800	3839320	Okay.
3839320	3841200	Oh, my God. Are we done?
3841200	3842560	No, you're going back up.
3843440	3848800	The show itself hasn't changed too much, which has been a bit more involved in comparison to previous seasons.
3848800	3852320	I guess as one of the more perceptibly unproblematic individuals,
3852320	3857920	his presence is a more effective instrument to win back people who may feel disillusioned with Ellen and her routine.
3857920	3862000	There are still stories being published here and there about how Ellen has treated those around her,
3862000	3864000	though unless there are any huge developments,
3864000	3869800	I'd expect these to fade as people gradually lose interest in the topic and move on to the next badly behaving star,
3869800	3872720	leaving this American idol to her own devices,
3872720	3876120	rebuilding that which she may have lost before she loses far more.
3876120	3878920	It's hard to believe that the plug will be pulled with the current ratings,
3878920	3884120	and it's still important to remember that a bad season for Ellen is still far better than a good season for most broadcasts.
3884200	3888640	At the same time, doing badly by one's own standards can still be demoralizing,
3888640	3892840	and there will be questions as to whether it's worth pushing on under such pretenses.
3892840	3894600	As it stands, it appears that she will,
3894600	3900640	but there's no real surprise behind why viewership may well be down for a program that couldn't respect its own foundations.
3900640	3904840	Ellen herself took the reputational benefits that the show bestowed onto her for granted,
3904840	3906480	and eventually it came back to bite her.
3906480	3910440	But the burning question is, how much did she know, and what exactly did she do?
3910440	3913040	What rubs a lot of people the wrong way is the hypocrisy of it.
3913040	3917240	When you project this image out of the world of being kind and loving and charitable,
3917240	3923640	but it turns out to all be a facade to make yourself look better when in actuality you're kind of a monster behind the scenes,
3923640	3927040	that's worse than just unapologetically being an asshole.
3927040	3931160	You reel people in with this fake persona and get them to fall in love with you,
3931160	3933840	but you've actually been lying to their face this entire time.
3933840	3938080	YouTubers and much of the press were largely unanimous in delivering their prognosis,
3938080	3942960	often framing Ellen as indifferent to the suffering of those around her, even outright indulging in it.
3942960	3945960	This was backed up by testimonies from people who claim to work with her,
3945960	3950400	and substantial evidence that for many elaborated on an already well grounded perspective.
3950400	3955600	However, with all this acknowledged, I feel like it was quite a selective set of evidence picked by those online.
3955600	3958160	But I do agree, we shouldn't only be blaming Ellen.
3958160	3962400	I would also say that Warner is probably more guilty here than what Ellen is.
3962400	3967400	Oh, and of course, the other employees who also contributed in making the workspace terrible.
3967400	3973080	For me personally, it's difficult to ignore the number of testimonies which actually refrained from incriminating Ellen,
3973080	3975320	especially those outside the celebrity clique.
3975320	3979840	The comprehensive expose from former employees stresses that Ellen was not directly aware,
3979840	3982720	even though she did neglect a certain degree of responsibility.
3982720	3986720	Are the stories where she's presented as a borderline psychopath incompatible with this?
3986720	3991400	Not entirely, but the depiction of the workplace where Ellen is like this detached matriarch
3991400	3996120	kind of makes it harder to believe that she also occupied the role of the power hungry dictator
3996120	4001240	who punishes people for her own pleasure, especially when some of her former colleagues go as far to defend her.
4001240	4005440	At the same time, there were former employees who would attack her, such as ex-producer Hedda Muscat,
4005440	4011040	who, working with Ellen between 2002 and 2004, had a very different idea of her awareness.
4011040	4017720	She laughed, and she said every production needs their dog, meaning Ed is her dog.
4017720	4018600	Like her attack dog.
4018600	4020880	Her attack dog, so therefore she doesn't need to do that.
4020960	4027520	He took the role of being the attack dog that she didn't have to now be the attack dog, so she didn't have to yell.
4027520	4033200	So when Ellen says she's not aware of this environment, you don't think that rings true?
4033200	4033920	It's a lie.
4033920	4036360	With all this factored in, it does become conflicting.
4036360	4042640	There are so many people with different ideas of who Ellen is, especially given that many of them worked the show at the same time,
4042640	4048280	and they may all have their own reasons for the positions they take, reasons that we'll never fully understand.
4048280	4052680	Now, as said, there isn't a reality where these two experiences can't coexist,
4052680	4056520	and the people who have advocated for it certainly makes it worthy of consideration,
4056520	4062160	but by writing out people's nuanced thoughts to suit a more one-dimensional character portrait, you risk two things.
4062160	4067760	First of all, downplaying the role that other actors have plagued, the corporation, producers, colleagues, for example,
4067760	4073320	and secondly, undermining the actual experience many of the more solidified allegations seem to imply.
4073320	4078480	I think that a lot of viewers had predetermined opinions, which led to a lot of people becoming overly pedantic
4078480	4083600	with what was really just a pretty average response to drama, even with some of these experts.
4083600	4087200	Oh boy, welcome to season 18 of the Ellen DeGeneres Show.
4087200	4089000	DeGeneres Show. DeGeneres Show.
4089000	4092800	So there's a bit of a self-sooth followed by a prayer, we've got a behavioural cluster.
4092800	4097800	Although she's trying to give this jovial, energetic, hey, it's okay, let's move on,
4097800	4105480	she's very aware, very aware about the potential downside of getting this wrong, but why should she be bothered about it?
4105480	4110120	If she hasn't done the stuff that she's been accused of, why is she praying?
4110120	4115520	What? I'm sorry, but I would be 100% uncomfortable addressing allegations whether they were true or not.
4115520	4120360	Telling someone that they don't have anything to worry about if they haven't done anything wrong is a good pet talk,
4120360	4123280	but it's certainly not an impenetrable attack on the accused.
4123280	4127640	You can make the argument that the fact that she's nervous is indicative that she clearly does care about this,
4127680	4131960	and I feel to a degree she would have faced criticism however she approached the response.
4131960	4136600	Or this comment which states that because she added a conditional clause, she was dismissing responsibility,
4136600	4141400	despite the fact that saying if was the most logical placement in the sentence given its generality.
4141400	4146000	And if I've ever let someone down, if I've ever hurt their feelings, I am so sorry for that.
4146000	4149440	If that's ever the case, I have let myself down and I've hurt myself as well.
4149440	4155000	If you use if in these circumstances, you are not a bad person, and I don't think it means that you're dismissing it.
4155040	4159000	I've used it in that context before, and I don't think that it's unfair to use it.
4159000	4166120	It seems like so many people are trying to galaxy brain analyze her statement when it may just be a bit lackluster and contrived.
4166120	4171880	In other cases, stories can be twisted, either through hyperbole for anecdotal purposes or the classic scenario of telephone.
4171880	4174640	Another good example of this is the chip nail polish incident.
4174640	4181000	One commenter recalled that the situation in question involved Ellen phoning up the branch management and attempting to have the employee fired following it,
4181040	4187520	but then the actual person who was at the center of the commotion commented saying Ellen had made a complaint which almost resulted in her being fired.
4187520	4193160	Now, I'm not trying to use this as a gotcha moment to prove the story as false because I don't disbelieve it one iota.
4193160	4196600	Once again, it's a case of how stories can be contorted by narratives.
4196600	4202120	A complaint with the intent to encourage a dismissal is very different to a complaint that almost leads to a dismissal,
4202120	4204920	as one implies much more about a plaintiff's intent.
4204920	4207240	Neither version of events flatters Ellen, of course.
4207240	4211200	I still think it's rather daft, but the difference is still notable.
4211200	4217800	This story is altered by Farah herself in an all stand up routine, obviously for humorous effect, and I don't think it discredits her story at all,
4217800	4222200	but it's easy to see how such details are told sparingly when they don't hold too much consequence,
4222200	4225920	even though with today's context, they may be decisive in understanding Ellen,
4225920	4231120	and I think some testimonies did fall foul to this weakness, especially ones told from a third party perspective.
4231120	4237000	I understand self-torture because for years I worked at an organic vegan mecca bag out of restaurant serving people.
4237000	4248400	Um, until I was released after a really popular talk show host emailed the owner and complained about my chips nail polish.
4248400	4250200	True story.
4250200	4256280	With a lot of these stories, if you become too fixated on the role Ellen plays and not the ways that other individuals may have contributed,
4257280	4263440	insensitive or coercive producers or anyone behind the scenes who is often much less accountable but still may hold a degree of power,
4263440	4270120	it's easy to lose sight of who else may have actually contributed to a situation and how they may also need to be held responsible for their actions.
4270120	4273000	In some ways, Ellen had gotten away with too much for too long.
4273000	4277280	At the same time, she shouldn't become a scapegoat too easily for other people's misdoings either.
4277280	4282560	The whole Ellen is a sadistic psycho narrative may be more exciting, but is it the most plausible?
4282560	4283720	I'll let you decide.
4283720	4290360	That's a more devil's advocate argument, but now I will leave on some more assured criticism because there's more than enough to go around.
4290360	4296680	Whether Ellen's genuinely mean or not, it seems there are a lot of legitimate grievances stemming from less than perfect encounters.
4296680	4304440	From an outsider's perspective, Ellen allowed herself to be separated from the masses, to subsequently fall out of touch with narratives that she branded herself with.
4304440	4308800	We're all going to be cold and distant from time to time, and I wouldn't attack her on the basis of that,
4308880	4315040	but I think it's very possible that this distance led to tone-deaf and insensitive behavior that has likely hurt a fair few people.
4315040	4319800	It could equally lend itself to pedantic micromanaging and comments that rub others the wrong way.
4319800	4325480	One of the saddest situations that encompasses this is Ellen's relationship with her head writer Karen Kilgerich,
4325480	4331360	a previously strong and productive bond broken apart by partisan interests with Ellen just going with it.
4331360	4337280	For me, if something like that happened, especially with business as it is, I would talk to them, understand their perspective.
4337280	4341840	Ellen didn't have enough control of her own production, or even her own character sometimes,
4341840	4346000	and even if what she felt from time to time was real, the show just wasn't.
4346000	4352560	It was a well-produced veneer to another rote broadcast that suffered from the same issues that is symptomatic of too many Hollywood creations.
4352560	4356120	It needed more humanity, and maybe Ellen needs it too.
4356120	4357600	Ellen- This is me.
4357600	4363040	The season 18 monologue wasn't the first time Ellen had spoken about her brand of kindness, and the toll it can take.
4363040	4368320	In the 2018 interview that I quoted earlier on in the video, she spoke about the mythical real Ellen,
4368320	4373680	and the weight of audience expectations on her to maintain a brand that she doesn't always identify with.
4373680	4379960	The article emphasising this, revealing that in person she's more blunt, introspective, and interesting than she is on the show,
4379960	4384560	willing to express mild irritation that may seem off-key in front of a national audience.
4384560	4390840	Some expect her to smile all the time, be cheerful, even dance, something that she stopped doing on her show a few years back,
4390840	4392680	because it was just too much.
4392680	4397360	At the same time, even with the controversy, she's continued to pursue the kindness image,
4397360	4400720	even recently launching this lovely Be Kind merchandise.
4400720	4405720	James Corden- She's around for too long, Fallon. All these people walk away. You've been famous forever.
4405720	4409440	Walk away like eventually everybody, they're just gonna figure it out.
4409440	4413360	A lot of people close to Ellen recognised what the show had done for her public persona,
4413360	4418080	but you could also observe that the show had constrained her image in a way that previous ventures hadn't,
4418120	4420480	establishing standards that she couldn't live up to.
4420480	4425040	Some around Ellen, her wife included, had encouraged DeGeneres to consider other avenues,
4425040	4427920	yet our intrepid title character persevered.
4427920	4434160	If the pre-allegation interview evinced anything, it was that the TV star saw her career path as a mixed blessing,
4434160	4439400	and was more aware of the perils than some may think, but it couldn't avert the inevitable tragedy.
4439400	4444920	The use of this interview to promote her Netflix comedy special Relatable is certainly ironic in hindsight,
4444920	4448520	the theme being satirical commentary on her place amongst the media elite,
4448520	4453200	and detachment from the Hoi Paloi, a concept that would rear its head in coming capers.
4453200	4458640	Ellen- A few years ago, I started ending my show by saying be kind to one another, but here's the downside.
4458640	4462960	I can never do anything unkind ever. I shouldn't even have a horn in my car.
4462960	4467720	Like, if someone cuts me off in a dangerous way, if I honk, they're like, Ellen?
4467720	4476600	Kindness is a virtue, not a brand, and expecting anyone to be the paragon of such a pure quality is bound to cause disappointment.
4476600	4481440	At the same time, it's not wrong to expect better from someone who claimed to be better,
4481440	4486680	someone who used the kindness narrative when it suited them, extending it to people who many would argue hadn't
4486680	4490680	practiced it themselves, yet neglecting it with those who probably needed it more.
4490680	4497480	Ellen seemed to be lost in the cosmos of her own status, and if anything, I hope the situation will pull her back down to Earth.
4497480	4501720	At the start of this video, I spoke about the similarities between YouTubers and talk show hosts,
4501720	4507880	however, what they may share in presentation, they differ greatly in composition, and Ellen is a prime example of that,
4507880	4514760	a person who, character aside, many will now see as an algorithmically calibrated puppet maintained by a contract,
4514760	4521280	rather than whatever the real Ellen is. The only person who may know who the real Ellen is, is Ellen herself,
4521280	4526360	and I hope she takes the time to find out what that means, however, if she wants to reclaim her public image,
4526360	4531640	then it may take more than just a monologue, it's going to take gradual healing exemplified by her own actions,
4531640	4535080	and I hope those who still believe in her will be rewarded in their faith.
4535080	4543560	Before I knew it, I had a successful sitcom, and I came out, and then I lost that sitcom, and then I got another sitcom,
4543560	4554440	and I lost that sitcom too, and after that, I got a talk show, and I was able to be myself, and it was 17 years ago,
4554600	4559400	and I feel like you've all really gotten to know me over the past 17 years.
4559400	4565480	The Ellen DeGeneres arc is certainly a fascinating one, a person who built an image from a philosophy rooted in struggle,
4565480	4572360	some of which she experienced directly with her TV career, only to be accused of deserting it when she ascended the industry ranks.
4572360	4578360	It's not a rare phenomenon, plenty of people are corrupted this way, but it seemed more exceptional given her own convictions,
4578360	4583640	and as a person who had been widely regarded as a national treasure, her downfall was almost awaited by those
4583640	4589880	who knew the potential of such a story, the twist villain per se, with content on and off YouTube attracting widespread
4589880	4595800	publicity and pulling apart what had taken years to construct. Whether the damage to her image will ever be repaired
4595800	4601560	is another question, and it'll depend on factors within, and likely beyond her control. Until then, the best she can do
4601560	4606360	is show that she does truly care about kindness, because heaven knows we need it right now.
4606360	4611160	I want to thank Olivia Munn, Ryan Gosling, Macklemore, have a wonderful weekend, be kind to one another, bye.
4613640	4630440	That was the video, what a great video, we had a great time recording that, I want to give big thanks to my editors,
4630440	4638840	what a great set of chaps, and chapesses, and chaperinos, love you all, and make sure you check them out in the pinned comment,
4638840	4647080	as always, big thanks to my Patreons, or my Patreons, as I've been informed, $10 patrons are up on screen right now,
4647080	4654920	but I want to give a special personal thanks to my $50 patrons, Devon, Shirochigo, Amanda, Hypercube, CarolinaSumhalaBlue,

4668120	4673240	My social medias will also be in the pinned comments, I don't know what else I have to add at this point,
4673240	4679800	I had a great time recording this, as aforementioned, my ear was playing up, but I just stuck a headphone,
4679800	4685720	a little Raycon bud in there quite deep, and that has suppressed it for now, which has allowed me to talk over it,
4685720	4691400	so if you're listening to this ear, fuck you, if you're listening to this, anyone else, thank you,
4691400	4694360	and thank you for your continued support. Take care, guys.
