00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,020
Sometimes human stupidity just amazes me.

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,860
Hello, I'm The Right Opinion, and today we talk about nature.

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:17,100
In the last couple weeks, two stories in very quick succession of the same tragic nature caught my eye.

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,800
One in which a man jumped into a lion's enclosure in a strangely elaborate attempt to commit suicide,

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,900
and another where a four-year-old child climbed into a gorilla enclosure and was subsequently grabbed by one of the gorillas.

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:34,300
In both occasions, the animals had to be killed to prevent any loss of human life, which is really very sad,

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:40,300
but also angering as well. How many more times will incidents like these continue to happen before we react to it?

8
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:46,400
The silverback gorilla, which was killed, was an endangered animal, and lions are just as precious regardless of their conservation status.

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,300
It's ironic that an animal taken out of the wild for preservation has been shot dead so brutally.

10
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,300
It's also been argued that the silverback gorilla was in fact protecting the child, which makes the situation even more out of hand.

11
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,200
However, I'm not doubting that to protect human life, that may have been the only cause of action,

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,500
as tranquilizers may not have worked fast enough in both instances.

13
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,400
However, instead of having to react to these situations, is it not time we just went up for straight prevention?

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,100
Firstly, I'd like to ask how a guy managed to access a fucking lion enclosure.

15
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,000
Secondly, I'd like to ask where the fuck were this kid's parents?

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I would genuinely consider prosecuting them for neglect, although we'll have to wait for any further circumstances to be revealed.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,200
If they dared let that child out of sight or even left him, endangered him without supervision, then that's recklessly irresponsible,

18
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,700
and they should be held accountable for those actions.

19
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,600
There should be a course of action. Children that age cannot be expected to look after themselves.

20
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:43,200
But if we do have these sorts of enclosures for certain animals, I believe there should be a construct that prevents anyone from climbing into them.

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,600
I know it may sound radical, but certain idiots have already shown they cannot be trusted with animals,

22
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,900
and in my opinion, the rights of these animals include being protected from stupid bellends.

23
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,800
And now we need to talk about the zoos themselves.

24
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,600
Some zoos can be very useful for the preservation of an animal,

25
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,200
especially in an open safari landscape where animals can experience their natural habitat on a large scale away from the dangers of poaching.

26
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,400
I genuinely think that is fantastic.

27
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,700
However, if we look towards many zoos that don't have this format, especially those in East Asia, many of them are not for preservation.

28
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,200
They're just for keeping animals in captivity for show. That's not what they should be about.

29
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,500
Animals should not be held in such terribly restrictive conditions at their expense for the pleasure of a few.

30
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,800
They should be benefiting as much as we are.

31
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,000
I do support the use of zoos in the correct context.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,300
However, this is regularly not the case, and there should be no superiority complex putting human pleasure above an animal's right to live in their natural habitat.

33
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,800
We should engage in more open zoos which focus on the welfare of the animals, and look not just at how we keep ourselves safe,

34
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,100
but how we keep them safe from ridiculous situations that shouldn't be happening in the first place.

35
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:52,500
So, there are my thoughts on the recent situations with regards to the, um, animals.

36
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,000
I hope you liked it.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,700
If you emotionally liked, then I take the opinion that you should physically like.

38
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,500
However, I respect all points of view.

39
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,900
Please, like.

40
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,100
I need to eat.

41
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,300
Nah, I'm just bucking with you.

42
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,300
I'm the right opinion, and I'll see you on the next one.

43
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:21,700
Thanks for watching!
