Sometimes human stupidity just amazes me.

00:08.860 --> 00:11.860
Hello, I'm The Right Opinion, and today we talk about nature.

00:11.860 --> 00:17.100
In the last couple weeks, two stories in very quick succession of the same tragic nature caught my eye.

00:17.520 --> 00:22.800
One in which a man jumped into a lion's enclosure in a strangely elaborate attempt to commit suicide,

00:22.800 --> 00:28.900
and another where a four-year-old child climbed into a gorilla enclosure and was subsequently grabbed by one of the gorillas.

00:28.900 --> 00:34.300
In both occasions, the animals had to be killed to prevent any loss of human life, which is really very sad,

00:34.300 --> 00:40.300
but also angering as well. How many more times will incidents like these continue to happen before we react to it?

00:40.300 --> 00:46.400
The silverback gorilla, which was killed, was an endangered animal, and lions are just as precious regardless of their conservation status.

00:46.400 --> 00:51.300
It's ironic that an animal taken out of the wild for preservation has been shot dead so brutally.

00:51.300 --> 00:57.300
It's also been argued that the silverback gorilla was in fact protecting the child, which makes the situation even more out of hand.

00:57.300 --> 01:02.200
However, I'm not doubting that to protect human life, that may have been the only cause of action,

01:02.200 --> 01:05.500
as tranquilizers may not have worked fast enough in both instances.

01:05.500 --> 01:10.400
However, instead of having to react to these situations, is it not time we just went up for straight prevention?

01:10.400 --> 01:14.100
Firstly, I'd like to ask how a guy managed to access a fucking lion enclosure.

01:14.100 --> 01:17.000
Secondly, I'd like to ask where the fuck were this kid's parents?

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
I would genuinely consider prosecuting them for neglect, although we'll have to wait for any further circumstances to be revealed.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.200
If they dared let that child out of sight or even left him, endangered him without supervision, then that's recklessly irresponsible,

01:29.200 --> 01:31.700
and they should be held accountable for those actions.

01:31.700 --> 01:36.600
There should be a course of action. Children that age cannot be expected to look after themselves.

01:36.600 --> 01:43.200
But if we do have these sorts of enclosures for certain animals, I believe there should be a construct that prevents anyone from climbing into them.

01:43.200 --> 01:47.600
I know it may sound radical, but certain idiots have already shown they cannot be trusted with animals,

01:47.600 --> 01:52.900
and in my opinion, the rights of these animals include being protected from stupid bellends.

01:52.900 --> 01:54.800
And now we need to talk about the zoos themselves.

01:54.800 --> 01:57.600
Some zoos can be very useful for the preservation of an animal,

01:57.600 --> 02:04.200
especially in an open safari landscape where animals can experience their natural habitat on a large scale away from the dangers of poaching.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.400
I genuinely think that is fantastic.

02:06.400 --> 02:12.700
However, if we look towards many zoos that don't have this format, especially those in East Asia, many of them are not for preservation.

02:12.700 --> 02:17.200
They're just for keeping animals in captivity for show. That's not what they should be about.

02:17.200 --> 02:22.500
Animals should not be held in such terribly restrictive conditions at their expense for the pleasure of a few.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.800
They should be benefiting as much as we are.

02:24.800 --> 02:28.000
I do support the use of zoos in the correct context.

02:28.000 --> 02:36.300
However, this is regularly not the case, and there should be no superiority complex putting human pleasure above an animal's right to live in their natural habitat.

02:36.300 --> 02:41.800
We should engage in more open zoos which focus on the welfare of the animals, and look not just at how we keep ourselves safe,

02:41.800 --> 02:47.100
but how we keep them safe from ridiculous situations that shouldn't be happening in the first place.

02:47.100 --> 02:52.500
So, there are my thoughts on the recent situations with regards to the, um, animals.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.000
I hope you liked it.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.700
If you emotionally liked, then I take the opinion that you should physically like.

02:58.700 --> 03:01.500
However, I respect all points of view.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.900
Please, like.

03:03.900 --> 03:06.100
I need to eat.

03:06.100 --> 03:07.300
Nah, I'm just bucking with you.

03:07.300 --> 03:09.300
I'm the right opinion, and I'll see you on the next one.

03:09.300 --> 03:21.700
Thanks for watching!
