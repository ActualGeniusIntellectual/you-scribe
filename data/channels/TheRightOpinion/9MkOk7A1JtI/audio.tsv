0	3020	Sometimes human stupidity just amazes me.
8860	11860	Hello, I'm The Right Opinion, and today we talk about nature.
11860	17100	In the last couple weeks, two stories in very quick succession of the same tragic nature caught my eye.
17520	22800	One in which a man jumped into a lion's enclosure in a strangely elaborate attempt to commit suicide,
22800	28900	and another where a four-year-old child climbed into a gorilla enclosure and was subsequently grabbed by one of the gorillas.
28900	34300	In both occasions, the animals had to be killed to prevent any loss of human life, which is really very sad,
34300	40300	but also angering as well. How many more times will incidents like these continue to happen before we react to it?
40300	46400	The silverback gorilla, which was killed, was an endangered animal, and lions are just as precious regardless of their conservation status.
46400	51300	It's ironic that an animal taken out of the wild for preservation has been shot dead so brutally.
51300	57300	It's also been argued that the silverback gorilla was in fact protecting the child, which makes the situation even more out of hand.
57300	62200	However, I'm not doubting that to protect human life, that may have been the only cause of action,
62200	65500	as tranquilizers may not have worked fast enough in both instances.
65500	70400	However, instead of having to react to these situations, is it not time we just went up for straight prevention?
70400	74100	Firstly, I'd like to ask how a guy managed to access a fucking lion enclosure.
74100	77000	Secondly, I'd like to ask where the fuck were this kid's parents?
77000	83000	I would genuinely consider prosecuting them for neglect, although we'll have to wait for any further circumstances to be revealed.
83000	89200	If they dared let that child out of sight or even left him, endangered him without supervision, then that's recklessly irresponsible,
89200	91700	and they should be held accountable for those actions.
91700	96600	There should be a course of action. Children that age cannot be expected to look after themselves.
96600	103200	But if we do have these sorts of enclosures for certain animals, I believe there should be a construct that prevents anyone from climbing into them.
103200	107600	I know it may sound radical, but certain idiots have already shown they cannot be trusted with animals,
107600	112900	and in my opinion, the rights of these animals include being protected from stupid bellends.
112900	114800	And now we need to talk about the zoos themselves.
114800	117600	Some zoos can be very useful for the preservation of an animal,
117600	124200	especially in an open safari landscape where animals can experience their natural habitat on a large scale away from the dangers of poaching.
124200	126400	I genuinely think that is fantastic.
126400	132700	However, if we look towards many zoos that don't have this format, especially those in East Asia, many of them are not for preservation.
132700	137200	They're just for keeping animals in captivity for show. That's not what they should be about.
137200	142500	Animals should not be held in such terribly restrictive conditions at their expense for the pleasure of a few.
142500	144800	They should be benefiting as much as we are.
144800	148000	I do support the use of zoos in the correct context.
148000	156300	However, this is regularly not the case, and there should be no superiority complex putting human pleasure above an animal's right to live in their natural habitat.
156300	161800	We should engage in more open zoos which focus on the welfare of the animals, and look not just at how we keep ourselves safe,
161800	167100	but how we keep them safe from ridiculous situations that shouldn't be happening in the first place.
167100	172500	So, there are my thoughts on the recent situations with regards to the, um, animals.
172500	174000	I hope you liked it.
174000	178700	If you emotionally liked, then I take the opinion that you should physically like.
178700	181500	However, I respect all points of view.
181500	183900	Please, like.
183900	186100	I need to eat.
186100	187300	Nah, I'm just bucking with you.
187300	189300	I'm the right opinion, and I'll see you on the next one.
189300	201700	Thanks for watching!
