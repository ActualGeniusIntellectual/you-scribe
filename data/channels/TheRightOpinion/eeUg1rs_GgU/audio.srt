00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,600
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,760
and I hope you're enjoying living in the modern era of YouTube, though you probably aren't.

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,800
However, for today's topic, we removed the prim and proper suits of modern YouTube, and donned the trackies and overcoats.

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,160
Yes, we're bringing out the big guns. Let's hop in the Tro-Time machine and head back to 2012,

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,000
the time when a very unique gentleman was at the pinnacle of YouTube.

6
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:40,920
This is a man known as FPS Russia. Now, he isn't spoken too much about these days, but you know, I think he should be.

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,080
It's hard to think of a better example of a creator who could make content catered to popular interest while uploading videos

8
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,880
whose style probably wouldn't have worked on any other platform besides YouTube.

9
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,560
Yes, I have a hunch if the gents over at Sons of Gun suddenly started putting on slightly subpar Russian accents,

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,800
the producers over at the Discovery Channel would have been rather unimpressed, though honestly, I think they would have taken that

11
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,600
rather than actually what happened to the host of that show.

12
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:10,520
However, for those who are a bit newer to the platform, you may not be completely familiar with the background of today's subject,

13
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,920
Kyle Myers or FPS Russia, so the next five minutes also will be focused on that.

14
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:25,840
Like a large majority of creators, FPS Russia had an extensive history on the platform, starting on the extremely catchy name of KLM5986.

15
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,720
He was originally a gaming channel who went by the name of FPS Kyle. I assume at some point he came to this idea of,

16
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:38,920
well, what would happen if I did gaming but with a Russian accent, and thus FPS Russia was born, because initially FPS Russia

17
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,280
was actually also a gaming channel, a gaming channel that performed relatively well, mind you.

18
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,280
Hell, in one of the old screenshots I'd found, there was even an old comment saying that he was about to blow up.

19
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,000
And boy, did he, though probably not in the way that people predicted.

20
00:01:52,320 --> 00:02:00,720
Playing like this make many people very angry. They send me lots of angry messages and send me mean text messages,

21
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:08,360
mean voicemail, and I just laugh and laugh. It is very, very funny to get the hate mail from the bitches.

22
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,440
Apparently finding out that this accent was fake was like finding out Santa wasn't real.

23
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,120
Well kids, if you're watching this, Santa is as real as this accent. Do what you want with that statement.

24
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,840
Not too long after his gaming ventures, Kyle decided to expand his content, attempting more creative sketches,

25
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,680
most of which are long gone, although I was moderately taken aback by one named I love very young girls,

26
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,960
alongside some very timely top comments. The glory days of YouTube have truly passed us by.

27
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:43,280
At some point he must have noticed that certain weapon related content was performing significantly better than the rest of his uploads,

28
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,960
and he decided to focus on pursuing that as a brand, a justified business decision.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,520
The videos that are currently on his channel definitely represent that brand in the most accurate possible way.

30
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,320
With FPS Russia, you would receive a first class ticket to the gun show.

31
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,920
His videos typically exhibited a variety of weapons and stunts based around the discharge of such content.

32
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:10,520
It was punchy, entertaining, and strangely satisfying for a multitude of reasons, all mixed in with that slightly eccentric persona.

33
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,000
It was a recipe for success, and in the coming years he experienced just that.

34
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,880
He became one of the most popular YouTubers on the platform, at one point being the third most subscribed channel on the whole of YouTube.

35
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:28,360
He appeared in related media, including an ad for Call of Duty Black Ops 2 alongside Robert Downey Jr,

36
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:34,640
and he even launched his own app, FPS Russia The Game, after a highly successful Kickstarter campaign.

37
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,560
He was more than just a guy shooting guns, he was a real personality, and he played into that.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It was pretty damn genius, the persona was a simplistic Russian guy which worked incredibly well because of the limited spoken content.

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,520
He would keep it simple, shut up, and shoot his gun, and not bother with too many technicalities that a majority of people probably wouldn't be the most interested in.

40
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:09,840
He knew primarily to focus on the sensation of shooting guns, at the same time his persona complemented it well,

41
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,240
it was a stereotype, and in many ways he appealed to stereotypical mannerisms that made the content enjoyable,

42
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,960
and appeared alongside those who emboldened that.

43
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:26,080
I assume most people know what an exploitation film is, it's something that works to cater to trends in the most obscene way possible.

44
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,760
FPS Russia took some of those elements and combined it with the realism that people expected of a YouTube video,

45
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,640
and created something grounded yet impactful.

46
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:41,920
Oh yeah, give me that slo-mo baby, you love to see it.

47
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,520
At its core, FPS Russia's videos were the perfect balance of amateur and professional.

48
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,000
He's a bloke with a bit too much firepower, but at the same time, he's got a bloody tank.

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:03,520
Point is, you needed some balls and some money to do what he did, however, to be such a public yet seemingly unprotected figure participating in hazardous activities

50
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,320
on this relatively unknown, uncensored platform places you in a position where you may be in the sight of multiple parties,

51
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,680
all willing to take their own shots, and when you're such a large target, you're gonna catch a couple bullets,

52
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,200
and that's what we're going to be discussing today.

53
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:26,720
As of November-December 2019, I don't know when this video will be out, his child sits dormant, untouched for over three years,

54
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,840
and it wasn't because he ran out of money or balls, no, I don't think that will be a problem for him.

55
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:38,160
It's a complicated story that, whatever way you look at it, started in 2013, and when you uncover the details,

56
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:47,440
you'll find the sudden demise of a channel embodied in drama, conspiracy theories, death, prison, and actually some interesting sociopolitical discourse.

57
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:54,640
So we're gonna do all that today, and hopefully more, so we can find out about the curious fate of FPS Russia.

58
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,240
See, I said the title, that makes me clever, hahaha.

59
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,960
Let us embark on this most mysterious journey, let's set the ship to full mast.

60
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,560
For this next part, I'll be putting some of my more morbid murder interest to the grindstone.

61
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,240
With that said, this is also a disclaimer because, although relevant, it also touches on some sensitive topics.

62
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,200
So without further ado, let's dim the lights.

63
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,160
FPS Russia wasn't a single person project. Now, I'm sure that'll surprise no one,

64
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,600
it'd take a lot of time and ability to obtain all his equipment, organize film crews, edit, and so on,

65
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,800
and the bottom line is that people just want to see the final results.

66
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,160
This is where we introduce you to someone by the name of Keith Ratliff.

67
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,040
Keith Richard Ratliff was a gun enthusiast, husband, and father hailing from Kentucky,

68
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,320
but also someone fairly involved in the FPS Russia YouTube channel.

69
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,720
The extent of his involvement seems uncertain, some people claiming that he was merely a member

70
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,120
of the production team, whereas many closer to Ratliff claiming he was one of the co-founders

71
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,760
of the channel itself. This latter assertion would have surprised me given the nature of the channel

72
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,880
when it was originally founded, but maybe he became heavily involved not too soon after.

73
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,760
One detail that was uncontested was the role he played in the channel, often obtaining extremely

74
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,240
rare and otherwise inaccessible weaponry. He had previously worked as a marketing manager,

75
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,640
and had even attempted online ventures before, such as his ownership of the website known as

76
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:26,160
Sotastic.com, a marketing-oriented business. In November 2011, he co-founded FPS Industries LLC,

77
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,520
which combined Keith's marketing expertise with his love for firearms. In February of 2012,

78
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,200
he moved from Kentucky to Carnesville, Georgia. I assume this was in part because FPS Industries LLC

79
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,000
was also a Type 10 destructors manufacturer, which is a high-level license for those who wish to

80
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,920
produce and deal with destructive devices, ammunition for those destructive devices,

81
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,800
armor-piercing ammunition, and other various weaponry. It cost them money to apply and renew

82
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,280
every now and then, and as far as it is published on their Facebook page, Keith was the one with the

83
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,200
license. There are a load of additional technicalities and licenses that you will

84
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,760
likely have to apply for, but it's understandable that Ratliff wanted to move closer to the source

85
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,240
of this income, so he left his family in Kentucky to pursue this business venture and the many

86
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,800
successes that it could yield. Keith also had a YouTube channel at one point called Guns,

87
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,160
Guns, and More Guns, though its name changed a few times. This channel has also since been closed.

88
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,080
He also ran the FPS Industries LLC Facebook page. He was just stereotypical gun-loving man.

89
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,040
He had ambitions, dreams, and Obama memes. Everything moved fairly smoothly for just shy

90
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,840
of a year. The YouTube channels excelled, and the business seemed to have decent traffic as well.

91
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,480
However, barely a few days into the new year, on the 4th of January 2013,

92
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,040
he was discovered deceased with a single gunshot wound to the head. There were a lot of guns

93
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,880
surrounding him, but not the one that was responsible for his death. There was no sign

94
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,840
of a struggle, no sign of a break-in, a few guns were missing, but nothing that would amount to

95
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,840
a theft being the motive. The surveillance equipment was missing as well, so unfortunately,

96
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,080
the crime wasn't captured. It was a pretty sparse crime scene, and although there was a lot of

97
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,400
initial attention on the case, with the state of Georgia police releasing a statement regarding

98
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,080
these circumstances, it died down fairly rapidly and left a lot of unanswered questions behind.

99
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,840
At the time, there was a lot of confusion with some people thinking Kyle was actually the one

100
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,080
who had been killed, which wasn't the case, and there was also this claim that Keith had been

101
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,080
tied up prior to being shot. This was also untrue. With all the details considered, many people felt

102
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,800
like the person who had murdered Keith must have known him, especially given the lack of otherwise

103
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,800
clear motive. It felt like it would have needed to be something more personal, or at least

104
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,040
premeditated. He also hadn't been living in Georgia too long, so it had to be someone

105
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,600
relatively current in his life. There were also some pretty wild conspiracy theories,

106
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,440
some wondering if he'd been targeted by the government or a gun control group,

107
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,080
due to his glorification of gun culture and outspoken criticism of gun control.

108
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,000
Most of you can't. That should be illegal. Every one of you should be able to own an assault weapon

109
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,360
of your choice, because that's what the Second Amendment in America is about. It's about owning

110
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,800
weaponry to allow you to defend oneself from all enemies, no matter where they arise from.

111
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,200
However, in both these instances, you'd think that the groups would have been more direct and

112
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,600
would have made more of an example of him, though the government wouldn't, but I think the government

113
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,920
have other things to deal with. Another theory that was floating around was the idea that this

114
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,360
was an arms deal gone wrong, and although the Type 10 license did give Ratliff an extensive amount

115
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,440
of power to trade within the industry, the proof substantiating these theories is weak.

116
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,400
Ultimately, the relevancy of this saga is that regardless of who committed the crime, the unsolved

117
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,280
nature hanging over the head of the community set an uncomfortable spotlight on anyone in the

118
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,080
vicinity, particularly those with an arsenal of weapons. The truth is that many people close to

119
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,680
Ratliff had one person in mind, and that was Kyle. Statements made by those from the Justice for

120
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,320
Keith Ratliff pressure group, and even in their petition, clearly alludes to the idea that Kyle

121
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,400
was the individual who committed the crime, and that the police hadn't acted on it due to the

122
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:06,240
fact that Ratliff wasn't from around those parts, and Kyle was. As a business partner, someone who

123
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,560
knew the environment, and as someone whom Keith would have trusted, there are certain circumstances

124
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,600
that may have made this a more fitting theory, but there's also a significant lack of public motive,

125
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,160
and given Keith's value to the business, it would have seemed an exceptionally ill-advised move.

126
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,240
I don't really want to focus on the theory, but it's important to note how this would have affected

127
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,920
the channel, a channel focused primarily on the utility of dangerous weapons. Keith was important,

128
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,000
and this incident would have struck fear into a lot of people associated with the channel given

129
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,720
the unknown perpetrator and motive. Uncertainty is a curse. What's worse is that given his proximity,

130
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,040
regardless of the verifiability, it was inevitable that Kyle, regardless of motive,

131
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,520
was going to be one of the key suspects, and Keith's untimely murder put Kyle on the police

132
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,720
radar in a way that affected his trade. Less than two months later, federal agents from the ATF,

133
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,160
alongside the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, raided his and his father's place. While the ATF

134
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,800
claimed it was for unrelated issues regarding explosives, the sheriff claimed it was regarding

135
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,920
the murder, the legal side being as coherent as ever. It was never said if anything of value was

136
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,480
actually taken, although Kyle was reported to have been charged with anything. Nonetheless,

137
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,720
the raid was probably quite stressful, and it was followed by an extended hiatus until his return in 2014.

138
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,520
And it has been a very long time since we've uploaded the video, and it's been a while since

139
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:31,600
I've posted on social media as well, and I wanted to first of all explain that I've been through so

140
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,560
many times where I've been trying to set up production days, working with film crews, working

141
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,440
with high-speed stuff, and everything fell through, and I kept telling everyone, we'll have a video in

142
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,920
a week, we'll have a video in a month, and that was based on promises that had been made to me.

143
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,280
Then when those promises get broken, I look like the liar, so I wanted to wait until I had everything

144
00:12:53,280 --> 00:13:00,720
ready, had several videos in the bank, and we're there now. So first things first, we've got a very

145
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:09,760
nice 12 gauge. But hey, at least he was back, right? Right? Well, unfortunately, it's never really over.

146
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:22,320
The whole situation regarding the death of Keith Ratliff was a blight on everyone involved,

147
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,880
particularly given that it was unresolved. The variety of theories couldn't really change the people

148
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,600
who were closest to him at the time. One of the biggest issues is that our friend Kyle probably

149
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,160
anticipated that the police were under some sort of pressure to solve the crime, and that given his

150
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,960
public YouTube channel, he was playing with fire in more ways than one. However, he couldn't risk

151
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:46,320
compromising his business, it was still incredibly successful, he still had an audience, and he still

152
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:53,440
had a demand. So as noted in 2014, around 9 months after the raid of his house, he returned triumphantly

153
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,880
and resumed his content. Now, I'd say he's not really afraid of taking risks, so I doubt it was the most

154
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,080
difficult decision at that point. And besides, at that point, the feds had done a sweep, there wasn't

155
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:09,040
very much else they could expect to find. However, many police departments may attempt to find reasons

156
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,400
to return to the residence of a suspect later on, in case the subject in question had temporarily

157
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:19,120
moved certain suspicious items and returned them at a later date. Therefore, the police would have

158
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,160
no hesitation in returning if granted the opportunity. Of course, they would need suspicious

159
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,520
activity to justify a warrant, and although one would describe FPS Russia's activities as

160
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,320
particularly regular, in the context of what he did with his channel, it was hard to frame it as

161
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,680
criminally suspicious. Nonetheless, even after his return, a lot of the YouTube mystery persisted in

162
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,040
the world of FPS Russia, a lot of internet detectives didn't let off, people trying to work out who

163
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,240
had murdered Keith Ratliff as if they were going to bust open the case, and in spite of understandable

164
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,120
irritation from the team at FPS Industries, they eventually granted one interview with Kyle,

165
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,880
with conditions prevailing that the questions were sent in advance.

166
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:05,360
As far as why he was killed, you know, who's to say? I loved Keith, Keith was my buddy, Keith had been my friend

167
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:12,000
for a couple of years, we travelled the country together, so it's hard for me to say, oh yeah, this person

168
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,480
or that person, you know, everybody's got enemies I suppose, people who don't care for the way they do

169
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,680
things, you know, he had a, he had a rocky personal life with women, you know, I know he'd had some

170
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,760
trouble in business in the past, but nothing that would bring something like this, you know, at least

171
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,240
we wouldn't think so, so no idea, it's uh, no idea.

172
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,520
I don't really have too much to add here, what I know about Keith didn't extend to such matters, but I can

173
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,600
understand why he didn't want to make further comments. At the same time, it's good to have a

174
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,480
statement out there for reference, this interview was part of another documentary that framed Kyle

175
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,320
fairly negatively, and to be honest, although he maybe should have turned up at some of the prior

176
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,280
interviews, if I was in his shoes, I'd probably be a bit frustrated about the situation persisting in

177
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,240
the way it had, it's hard to conclude anything, the video is called Who Killed Keith Ratliff?, and all

178
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,520
you conclude is that no one had a bloody clue. Over the time period, the regularity of uploads

179
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:11,920
became more and more sporadic, and in April 2016, FPS Russia published his final video, one where he

180
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,960
tested out some very nice flamethrowers. These videos seemed fairly routine in nature, and nothing

181
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:22,320
was identifiably wrong, it's unclear as to why he exactly stopped at that point, screenshots in the

182
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,200
months prior showed his channel not performing too well, but still somewhat decently, though obviously

183
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,520
such weapons wouldn't have been particularly cheap to own. Also, another really important thing to note

184
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:36,640
was that this was around the time of the apocalypse, and honestly, it's hard to see how a channel like

185
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:42,000
his would have received many liberties. It sucks, because on principle, he's not a terrorist, and what

186
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,280
he does isn't particularly exceptional to many shows you'd see on TV, but for creators who deal with

187
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,560
any sort of weaponry, the mere sight of them in 2016 would have probably given the lads over at

188
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,400
Googleplex an aneurysm. Unfortunately, what FPS Russia did was high risk, high reward, and I have a

189
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,440
hunch that although he was never really afraid of the risk, the reward came with diminishing returns.

190
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,680
Nonetheless, his presence from YouTube didn't completely disappear, it's likely that he had made

191
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:12,400
a fair amount of money at that time, so he could chill and pursue more relaxed personal ventures.

192
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,040
One of his friends, Woody's gamertag, posted a podcast called the Painkiller Podcast, on which

193
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:22,880
Kyle was a regular co-host. On this side of the internet, he was just known as Kyle, and the Russian accent was gone.

194
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,880
Yeah, of course, we have a few sponsors tonight, Smartmouth, of course, making its return, as well as

195
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,480
Lyft, Zip Recruiter, and Jack Threads, and MeUndies, so you can check them out down in the description below.

196
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,120
I'm gonna talk about each of them more later on, but for now, let's just start the show.

197
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,760
It's hard to say it was anything particularly exhilarating, but I think it was entertaining enough,

198
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,960
and Kyle seemed to be having fun, so that's what matters. The podcast itself probably generates a

199
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,280
decent amount of income due to the number of sponsors, and Kyle typically did the readings.

200
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,920
He still does a fair few episodes there now, so if you're wondering where to find him, that's where

201
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:01,520
you can go. However, if it was the end of the story, the arc would be incomplete, because as said,

202
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,080
since the death of Keith Ratliff, the police have probably been glancing in his direction a bit more

203
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,200
than they normally would. As mentioned, if the opportunity arose to raid his property again,

204
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,720
they would. Unfortunately, that opportunity did, and after receiving a tip-off that Kyle had imported

205
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,760
25 grams of butane hash oil through the mail, which was a pretty bad idea to be honest,

206
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:28,000
law officials moved in on Kyle and his residents once more in August of 2017. I have little doubt

207
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,760
that this was in part due to the hope that they thought they'd maybe find something they hadn't

208
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,640
before, and their search of Kyle's residence extended to looking for weapons and explosives.

209
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,560
As he was charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, they removed these

210
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,360
weapons due to a statute that prevented illegal drug users from owning them. Honestly, I'm

211
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:52,720
disappointed. I can't think of a better combination than guns and weed. Am I right kids? I'm so hip.

212
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,840
I have a hunch the feds in general didn't really approve of Kyle's operations, and they were aware

213
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,320
that having a criminal record would prevent him from owning and thus using firearms again.

214
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,920
I feel that this and the next part is going to undermine the theory that the police were

215
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,240
protecting him in any way, because I don't think they liked him, and what he subsequently went

216
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,080
down for was pretty bizarre, so let's talk about it.

217
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,280
The state attorney accumulated a list of crimes that they felt our good friend Kyle here was

218
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,920
culpable for. These crimes included possession with intent to distribute marijuana and butane

219
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:37,120
honey oil, maintaining a drug premises, possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number,

220
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,480
and possession of a firearm by a drug user. That's a lot to digest. Now, the possession with intent

221
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,240
to distribute charge is the main charge that we'll focus on, as a felony it incurs up to 30 years in

222
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,960
prison, which would not have been a good outcome for anyone. However, the severity of these penalties

223
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,120
are known to be highly dependent on the circumstances surrounding them, and Kyle didn't

224
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,480
have a previous criminal record, nor was he some drug kingpin. In fact, according to a later podcast

225
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,600
after he was released on bail, it seemed to be quite the contrary.

226
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:24,960
Providing what he says is true here, law enforcement's reasoning is ridiculous, it's a piss take. However, as

227
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,920
noted, this was not the only charge, and the others may have carried significant punishment if he was

228
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,400
found guilty, which seemed like a plausible enough possibility for Kyle to vow to what is probably

229
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,520
known as a plea deal, or plea bargain. This plea deal basically meant that the latter three charges

230
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,240
that he was facing were completely dropped, and he was only sentenced on the basis of possession

231
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,600
of drugs with the intent to distribute, which to me still seemed kind of daft. Kyle was prosecuted

232
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,560
at a federal level as according to him, the state screwed their case up because they legitimised a

233
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,840
warrant on the basis that Kyle was wearing cargo shorts, which as a fashion choice implied he was

234
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:05,360
going back to his house with the marijuana. Let's be clear, they wanted to search the house.

235
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,080
If what he says is true, which it may well be given the leniency of the subsequent sentence,

236
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,240
I think he may have had a chance at fighting the case, but on the other hand, he knows the

237
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,200
environment of Georgia better than me, and given some of these charges seem stacked up, I understand

238
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,800
why he cut a deal, though once again, it all seems like a bit of a stitch up. I get why plea deals

239
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:30,000
exist, it just sucks that a possibly innocent party may be coerced into that position due to

240
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,080
the incentive of having other cases dropped. I hate it. I hate that system. On the other hand,

241
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,360
the fact that he did cut a deal makes me wonder if he ever intended to return to FPS Russia.

242
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,720
If he was prepared to blow up vehicles in his proximity, I'm sure he didn't mind a risk or two

243
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,360
here and there if it was something worth fighting for. Although the criminal record sucks, and I'm

244
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,320
sure legal advice factored into it to a degree, in hindsight he seemed fairly unphased talking

245
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,440
about it, reflecting on it like an entertaining story.

246
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:45,360
For the record, if you want to hear Karl's prison stories, I'll definitely leave a link in the pinned

247
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,480
comment below, it's surprisingly entertaining and often endearing. Ultimately, he was sentenced to

248
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,880
2 months in prison with supervised release, and an additional fine of $7,500, because they needed

249
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,720
some money from it as well I guess. He was charged in 2019, went to jail in around August, and got out

250
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,720
in October, like any other year really. So what's he up to now? Well, Karl's just chillin'. In spite of

251
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,520
everything, he's taken it quite well.

252
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:40,160
With that said, a lot of his stories can be quite concerning, particularly given how he talks about

253
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:45,200
his involvement with various seriously criminal individuals in prison. For someone like Karl, given

254
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,240
his success, it's not a huge deal, but it does illuminate a lot of issues with what happens when you put

255
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,160
someone in jail for a rather minor crime with a set of fairly serious criminals, and it does highlight some

256
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:01,360
of the issues with the prison system. If you want something interesting, yet somewhat enlightening,

257
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,320
definitely check those videos out. Most people know my politics as pretty anti-drug criminalization,

258
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,400
particularly drugs like marijuana, which when I studied in the Netherlands basically surrounded me,

259
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,960
and I was never really much of a user myself, but the environment that I resided in was fairly

260
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,240
harmonized, and so although it was a lot of THC oil, and Karl should have definitely known better given the

261
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,680
location he chose to reside in, and the culture being incumbent with that, it's a real shame that the laws

262
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:32,000
to me seem so harsh on him, because of this marijuana he lost the equivalent of $400,000 of

263
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,320
itinerary. I respect him for being honestly as placid as he is, I'm not sure I would be.

264
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,000
What do they do with the guns? They just hold on to them? Put them in a big vault somewhere?

265
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,360
Probably destroy them.

266
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,880
Oh, that's a shame.

267
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,400
Let's conclude then.

268
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,680
FPS Russia has its success rooted in the origins of that old generation of YouTube where people

269
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:56,800
embraced the chaos, and as Shao deserved to thrive as a product of that. But what was entertainment

270
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,600
eventually became quite real in a way that few could have anticipated. What followed was a

271
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,400
butterfly effect that destabilized a channel already somewhat fragile in the evolving environment,

272
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,600
and the man at the center of it. The channel's reliance on the character of Dimitri, as iconic

273
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,800
as he is, made the issues he faced concurrent with the ones that the channel faced. It cast a shadow

274
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,240
that everyone struggled to escape, and many refused to forget. It led to the eyes of drama detectives

275
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,640
and law enforcement who lay in wait for whatever opportunity they were yielded, and although you

276
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,200
could argue that Karl could have been more conscious of the risks, he couldn't live the rest of his life

277
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,000
looking over his shoulder, and maybe that's why he doesn't appear to care as much, maybe a burden

278
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,040
of sorts has been lifted. Hopefully sometime in the future, in a different environment, he'll have his

279
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:47,680
legal restrictions re-evaluated. I genuinely hope so. In a way, I do feel sad that they took so much

280
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:52,480
away from the channel, because even if you weren't using it anymore, it'd be nice to know it's there,

281
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,920
you know, in case you wanted to do a little special for the fans, and of course the value too.

282
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:03,120
There must have been some sentimental connection, or he probably would have sold it. It sucked.

283
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,960
Innocence prevailing in other situations, he deserved better, and I hope there is justice in the end,

284
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,400
for everything and everyone discussed today. For the moment, I hope he's happier with where he is now,

285
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:21,040
and as enshrined as it is, FPS Russia was a product of its time, and one whose time has probably passed.

286
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:28,640
To those who enjoyed it, well, don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.

287
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:36,400
You already knew how to shoot this shit. Hope you guys enjoyed the video, and as always, have a nice day.

288
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:46,320
So that was the video, I hope you enjoyed it, I think I enjoyed it. It was a bit shorter than

289
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,120
normal, but honestly, sometimes we have to moderate the time we spend on these things.

290
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,320
I started another video, and basically that one had some new information that I decided that actually

291
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,600
we should leave that a bit more, let it brew, and we'll act on that later. So I thought we'd do a

292
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,880
little retrospective on something that I do genuinely find quite interesting, and I hope that interest showed.

293
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,520
I wanted to give a big shoutout to my editors, once again, they have done a fantastic job,

294
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,400
I can't really thank them enough, they just do great work time after time, and it's great to know that I can rely on

295
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:24,000
people to make content that's entertaining for so many people. I also want to give a big shoutout to my

296
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,120
Patreons, current Patreons, at the time of the recording, November of course, is my $10 Patreons up on screen

297
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:38,480
right now, $50 Patreons, Sumhala Baloo, Nico Deschamps, and Caroline, and my $100 Patreons.

298
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:45,760
We have a new Patreon, who hopefully, I'm putting my faith into, for the pledge to go through at the end of the month,

299
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:51,360
Stanton, thank you very much, man, it really makes a difference. I also wanted to give a big thanks to Brandon,

300
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:57,680
someone who I still don't know who he is, his pledge has now, lifetime pledge has hit $1000, which honestly is

301
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:03,520
incredible, and I can't thank you enough, man, if you're watching this, love you, I hope you still take

302
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,760
something away from my videos, I hope you haven't spontaneously died or something, that would be terrible.

303
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:16,080
Also, if you wanna hit me up, Twitter, at The Right Opinion, Discord, and of course, Facebook, though I don't use

304
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,280
that right now, I'm gonna try and get back on it, it's all been a bit messy recently, I need to be a bit more

305
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:27,360
organised, also my Instagram, which is basically a bit more personal, if you wanna know what I'm up to, what I'm

306
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:35,360
doing, typically writing, scripting, talking like this, editing, or playing just dance, because you know me,

307
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,160
great dancer, and I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
