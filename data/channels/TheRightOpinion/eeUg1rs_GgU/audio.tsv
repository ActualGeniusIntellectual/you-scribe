0	10600	Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,
10600	15760	and I hope you're enjoying living in the modern era of YouTube, though you probably aren't.
15760	21800	However, for today's topic, we removed the prim and proper suits of modern YouTube, and donned the trackies and overcoats.
21800	27160	Yes, we're bringing out the big guns. Let's hop in the Tro-Time machine and head back to 2012,
27160	31000	the time when a very unique gentleman was at the pinnacle of YouTube.
33880	40920	This is a man known as FPS Russia. Now, he isn't spoken too much about these days, but you know, I think he should be.
40920	47080	It's hard to think of a better example of a creator who could make content catered to popular interest while uploading videos
47080	50880	whose style probably wouldn't have worked on any other platform besides YouTube.
50880	56560	Yes, I have a hunch if the gents over at Sons of Gun suddenly started putting on slightly subpar Russian accents,
56600	61800	the producers over at the Discovery Channel would have been rather unimpressed, though honestly, I think they would have taken that
61800	64600	rather than actually what happened to the host of that show.
64600	70520	However, for those who are a bit newer to the platform, you may not be completely familiar with the background of today's subject,
70520	75920	Kyle Myers or FPS Russia, so the next five minutes also will be focused on that.
76920	85840	Like a large majority of creators, FPS Russia had an extensive history on the platform, starting on the extremely catchy name of KLM5986.
85840	91720	He was originally a gaming channel who went by the name of FPS Kyle. I assume at some point he came to this idea of,
91720	98920	well, what would happen if I did gaming but with a Russian accent, and thus FPS Russia was born, because initially FPS Russia
98920	103280	was actually also a gaming channel, a gaming channel that performed relatively well, mind you.
103280	108280	Hell, in one of the old screenshots I'd found, there was even an old comment saying that he was about to blow up.
108280	112000	And boy, did he, though probably not in the way that people predicted.
112320	120720	Playing like this make many people very angry. They send me lots of angry messages and send me mean text messages,
120720	128360	mean voicemail, and I just laugh and laugh. It is very, very funny to get the hate mail from the bitches.
128360	133440	Apparently finding out that this accent was fake was like finding out Santa wasn't real.
133440	139120	Well kids, if you're watching this, Santa is as real as this accent. Do what you want with that statement.
139160	144840	Not too long after his gaming ventures, Kyle decided to expand his content, attempting more creative sketches,
144840	150680	most of which are long gone, although I was moderately taken aback by one named I love very young girls,
150680	156960	alongside some very timely top comments. The glory days of YouTube have truly passed us by.
156960	163280	At some point he must have noticed that certain weapon related content was performing significantly better than the rest of his uploads,
163280	167960	and he decided to focus on pursuing that as a brand, a justified business decision.
168000	173520	The videos that are currently on his channel definitely represent that brand in the most accurate possible way.
173520	177320	With FPS Russia, you would receive a first class ticket to the gun show.
177320	182920	His videos typically exhibited a variety of weapons and stunts based around the discharge of such content.
182920	190520	It was punchy, entertaining, and strangely satisfying for a multitude of reasons, all mixed in with that slightly eccentric persona.
190520	195000	It was a recipe for success, and in the coming years he experienced just that.
195040	201880	He became one of the most popular YouTubers on the platform, at one point being the third most subscribed channel on the whole of YouTube.
201880	208360	He appeared in related media, including an ad for Call of Duty Black Ops 2 alongside Robert Downey Jr,
208360	214640	and he even launched his own app, FPS Russia The Game, after a highly successful Kickstarter campaign.
214640	220560	He was more than just a guy shooting guns, he was a real personality, and he played into that.
225000	235000	It was pretty damn genius, the persona was a simplistic Russian guy which worked incredibly well because of the limited spoken content.
235000	243520	He would keep it simple, shut up, and shoot his gun, and not bother with too many technicalities that a majority of people probably wouldn't be the most interested in.
243520	249840	He knew primarily to focus on the sensation of shooting guns, at the same time his persona complemented it well,
249840	256240	it was a stereotype, and in many ways he appealed to stereotypical mannerisms that made the content enjoyable,
256240	258960	and appeared alongside those who emboldened that.
258960	266080	I assume most people know what an exploitation film is, it's something that works to cater to trends in the most obscene way possible.
266080	271760	FPS Russia took some of those elements and combined it with the realism that people expected of a YouTube video,
271760	274640	and created something grounded yet impactful.
274640	281920	Oh yeah, give me that slo-mo baby, you love to see it.
284920	289520	At its core, FPS Russia's videos were the perfect balance of amateur and professional.
289520	294000	He's a bloke with a bit too much firepower, but at the same time, he's got a bloody tank.
294000	303520	Point is, you needed some balls and some money to do what he did, however, to be such a public yet seemingly unprotected figure participating in hazardous activities
303520	310320	on this relatively unknown, uncensored platform places you in a position where you may be in the sight of multiple parties,
310320	315680	all willing to take their own shots, and when you're such a large target, you're gonna catch a couple bullets,
315680	319200	and that's what we're going to be discussing today.
319200	326720	As of November-December 2019, I don't know when this video will be out, his child sits dormant, untouched for over three years,
326720	331840	and it wasn't because he ran out of money or balls, no, I don't think that will be a problem for him.
331920	338160	It's a complicated story that, whatever way you look at it, started in 2013, and when you uncover the details,
338160	347440	you'll find the sudden demise of a channel embodied in drama, conspiracy theories, death, prison, and actually some interesting sociopolitical discourse.
347440	354640	So we're gonna do all that today, and hopefully more, so we can find out about the curious fate of FPS Russia.
354960	360240	See, I said the title, that makes me clever, hahaha.
360240	364960	Let us embark on this most mysterious journey, let's set the ship to full mast.
367680	372560	For this next part, I'll be putting some of my more morbid murder interest to the grindstone.
372560	378240	With that said, this is also a disclaimer because, although relevant, it also touches on some sensitive topics.
378240	381200	So without further ado, let's dim the lights.
381280	386160	FPS Russia wasn't a single person project. Now, I'm sure that'll surprise no one,
386160	391600	it'd take a lot of time and ability to obtain all his equipment, organize film crews, edit, and so on,
391600	394800	and the bottom line is that people just want to see the final results.
394800	398160	This is where we introduce you to someone by the name of Keith Ratliff.
398160	403040	Keith Richard Ratliff was a gun enthusiast, husband, and father hailing from Kentucky,
403040	406320	but also someone fairly involved in the FPS Russia YouTube channel.
406320	410720	The extent of his involvement seems uncertain, some people claiming that he was merely a member
410720	415120	of the production team, whereas many closer to Ratliff claiming he was one of the co-founders
415120	419760	of the channel itself. This latter assertion would have surprised me given the nature of the channel
419760	424880	when it was originally founded, but maybe he became heavily involved not too soon after.
424880	429760	One detail that was uncontested was the role he played in the channel, often obtaining extremely
429760	434240	rare and otherwise inaccessible weaponry. He had previously worked as a marketing manager,
434240	438640	and had even attempted online ventures before, such as his ownership of the website known as
438640	446160	Sotastic.com, a marketing-oriented business. In November 2011, he co-founded FPS Industries LLC,
446160	451520	which combined Keith's marketing expertise with his love for firearms. In February of 2012,
451520	457200	he moved from Kentucky to Carnesville, Georgia. I assume this was in part because FPS Industries LLC
457200	462000	was also a Type 10 destructors manufacturer, which is a high-level license for those who wish to
462000	465920	produce and deal with destructive devices, ammunition for those destructive devices,
465920	470800	armor-piercing ammunition, and other various weaponry. It cost them money to apply and renew
470800	475280	every now and then, and as far as it is published on their Facebook page, Keith was the one with the
475280	479200	license. There are a load of additional technicalities and licenses that you will
479200	483760	likely have to apply for, but it's understandable that Ratliff wanted to move closer to the source
483760	488240	of this income, so he left his family in Kentucky to pursue this business venture and the many
488240	492800	successes that it could yield. Keith also had a YouTube channel at one point called Guns,
492800	498160	Guns, and More Guns, though its name changed a few times. This channel has also since been closed.
498160	504080	He also ran the FPS Industries LLC Facebook page. He was just stereotypical gun-loving man.
504080	509040	He had ambitions, dreams, and Obama memes. Everything moved fairly smoothly for just shy
509040	513840	of a year. The YouTube channels excelled, and the business seemed to have decent traffic as well.
513840	518480	However, barely a few days into the new year, on the 4th of January 2013,
518480	523040	he was discovered deceased with a single gunshot wound to the head. There were a lot of guns
523040	526880	surrounding him, but not the one that was responsible for his death. There was no sign
526880	531840	of a struggle, no sign of a break-in, a few guns were missing, but nothing that would amount to
531840	535840	a theft being the motive. The surveillance equipment was missing as well, so unfortunately,
535840	540080	the crime wasn't captured. It was a pretty sparse crime scene, and although there was a lot of
540160	544400	initial attention on the case, with the state of Georgia police releasing a statement regarding
544400	550080	these circumstances, it died down fairly rapidly and left a lot of unanswered questions behind.
550080	553840	At the time, there was a lot of confusion with some people thinking Kyle was actually the one
553840	558080	who had been killed, which wasn't the case, and there was also this claim that Keith had been
558080	564080	tied up prior to being shot. This was also untrue. With all the details considered, many people felt
564080	568800	like the person who had murdered Keith must have known him, especially given the lack of otherwise
568800	572800	clear motive. It felt like it would have needed to be something more personal, or at least
572800	577040	premeditated. He also hadn't been living in Georgia too long, so it had to be someone
577040	581600	relatively current in his life. There were also some pretty wild conspiracy theories,
581600	585440	some wondering if he'd been targeted by the government or a gun control group,
585440	590080	due to his glorification of gun culture and outspoken criticism of gun control.
590080	596000	Most of you can't. That should be illegal. Every one of you should be able to own an assault weapon
596000	601360	of your choice, because that's what the Second Amendment in America is about. It's about owning
601920	608800	weaponry to allow you to defend oneself from all enemies, no matter where they arise from.
608800	613200	However, in both these instances, you'd think that the groups would have been more direct and
613200	617600	would have made more of an example of him, though the government wouldn't, but I think the government
617680	621920	have other things to deal with. Another theory that was floating around was the idea that this
621920	627360	was an arms deal gone wrong, and although the Type 10 license did give Ratliff an extensive amount
627360	631440	of power to trade within the industry, the proof substantiating these theories is weak.
631440	636400	Ultimately, the relevancy of this saga is that regardless of who committed the crime, the unsolved
636400	641280	nature hanging over the head of the community set an uncomfortable spotlight on anyone in the
641280	646080	vicinity, particularly those with an arsenal of weapons. The truth is that many people close to
646080	651680	Ratliff had one person in mind, and that was Kyle. Statements made by those from the Justice for
651680	656320	Keith Ratliff pressure group, and even in their petition, clearly alludes to the idea that Kyle
656320	660400	was the individual who committed the crime, and that the police hadn't acted on it due to the
660400	666240	fact that Ratliff wasn't from around those parts, and Kyle was. As a business partner, someone who
666240	670560	knew the environment, and as someone whom Keith would have trusted, there are certain circumstances
670560	675600	that may have made this a more fitting theory, but there's also a significant lack of public motive,
675600	680160	and given Keith's value to the business, it would have seemed an exceptionally ill-advised move.
680160	684240	I don't really want to focus on the theory, but it's important to note how this would have affected
684240	689920	the channel, a channel focused primarily on the utility of dangerous weapons. Keith was important,
689920	694000	and this incident would have struck fear into a lot of people associated with the channel given
694000	700720	the unknown perpetrator and motive. Uncertainty is a curse. What's worse is that given his proximity,
700720	705040	regardless of the verifiability, it was inevitable that Kyle, regardless of motive,
705040	709520	was going to be one of the key suspects, and Keith's untimely murder put Kyle on the police
709520	714720	radar in a way that affected his trade. Less than two months later, federal agents from the ATF,
714720	720160	alongside the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, raided his and his father's place. While the ATF
720160	724800	claimed it was for unrelated issues regarding explosives, the sheriff claimed it was regarding
724800	729920	the murder, the legal side being as coherent as ever. It was never said if anything of value was
729920	734480	actually taken, although Kyle was reported to have been charged with anything. Nonetheless,
734480	740720	the raid was probably quite stressful, and it was followed by an extended hiatus until his return in 2014.
740720	745520	And it has been a very long time since we've uploaded the video, and it's been a while since
745520	751600	I've posted on social media as well, and I wanted to first of all explain that I've been through so
751600	756560	many times where I've been trying to set up production days, working with film crews, working
756560	761440	with high-speed stuff, and everything fell through, and I kept telling everyone, we'll have a video in
761440	767920	a week, we'll have a video in a month, and that was based on promises that had been made to me.
767920	773280	Then when those promises get broken, I look like the liar, so I wanted to wait until I had everything
773280	780720	ready, had several videos in the bank, and we're there now. So first things first, we've got a very
780720	789760	nice 12 gauge. But hey, at least he was back, right? Right? Well, unfortunately, it's never really over.
789760	802320	The whole situation regarding the death of Keith Ratliff was a blight on everyone involved,
802320	806880	particularly given that it was unresolved. The variety of theories couldn't really change the people
806880	811600	who were closest to him at the time. One of the biggest issues is that our friend Kyle probably
811600	816160	anticipated that the police were under some sort of pressure to solve the crime, and that given his
816160	820960	public YouTube channel, he was playing with fire in more ways than one. However, he couldn't risk
820960	826320	compromising his business, it was still incredibly successful, he still had an audience, and he still
826320	833440	had a demand. So as noted in 2014, around 9 months after the raid of his house, he returned triumphantly
833440	838880	and resumed his content. Now, I'd say he's not really afraid of taking risks, so I doubt it was the most
838880	844080	difficult decision at that point. And besides, at that point, the feds had done a sweep, there wasn't
844080	849040	very much else they could expect to find. However, many police departments may attempt to find reasons
849040	854400	to return to the residence of a suspect later on, in case the subject in question had temporarily
854400	859120	moved certain suspicious items and returned them at a later date. Therefore, the police would have
859120	864160	no hesitation in returning if granted the opportunity. Of course, they would need suspicious
864160	869520	activity to justify a warrant, and although one would describe FPS Russia's activities as
869520	874320	particularly regular, in the context of what he did with his channel, it was hard to frame it as
874320	879680	criminally suspicious. Nonetheless, even after his return, a lot of the YouTube mystery persisted in
879680	885040	the world of FPS Russia, a lot of internet detectives didn't let off, people trying to work out who
885040	890240	had murdered Keith Ratliff as if they were going to bust open the case, and in spite of understandable
890240	895120	irritation from the team at FPS Industries, they eventually granted one interview with Kyle,
895120	898880	with conditions prevailing that the questions were sent in advance.
898880	905360	As far as why he was killed, you know, who's to say? I loved Keith, Keith was my buddy, Keith had been my friend
905360	912000	for a couple of years, we travelled the country together, so it's hard for me to say, oh yeah, this person
912000	916480	or that person, you know, everybody's got enemies I suppose, people who don't care for the way they do
916480	921680	things, you know, he had a, he had a rocky personal life with women, you know, I know he'd had some
921680	927760	trouble in business in the past, but nothing that would bring something like this, you know, at least
927760	932240	we wouldn't think so, so no idea, it's uh, no idea.
932240	937520	I don't really have too much to add here, what I know about Keith didn't extend to such matters, but I can
937520	941600	understand why he didn't want to make further comments. At the same time, it's good to have a
941600	946480	statement out there for reference, this interview was part of another documentary that framed Kyle
946480	950320	fairly negatively, and to be honest, although he maybe should have turned up at some of the prior
950320	955280	interviews, if I was in his shoes, I'd probably be a bit frustrated about the situation persisting in
955280	960240	the way it had, it's hard to conclude anything, the video is called Who Killed Keith Ratliff?, and all
960240	965520	you conclude is that no one had a bloody clue. Over the time period, the regularity of uploads
965520	971920	became more and more sporadic, and in April 2016, FPS Russia published his final video, one where he
971920	976960	tested out some very nice flamethrowers. These videos seemed fairly routine in nature, and nothing
976960	982320	was identifiably wrong, it's unclear as to why he exactly stopped at that point, screenshots in the
982320	987200	months prior showed his channel not performing too well, but still somewhat decently, though obviously
987200	991520	such weapons wouldn't have been particularly cheap to own. Also, another really important thing to note
991520	996640	was that this was around the time of the apocalypse, and honestly, it's hard to see how a channel like
996640	1002000	his would have received many liberties. It sucks, because on principle, he's not a terrorist, and what
1002000	1007280	he does isn't particularly exceptional to many shows you'd see on TV, but for creators who deal with
1007280	1012560	any sort of weaponry, the mere sight of them in 2016 would have probably given the lads over at
1012560	1018400	Googleplex an aneurysm. Unfortunately, what FPS Russia did was high risk, high reward, and I have a
1018480	1023440	hunch that although he was never really afraid of the risk, the reward came with diminishing returns.
1023440	1027680	Nonetheless, his presence from YouTube didn't completely disappear, it's likely that he had made
1027680	1032400	a fair amount of money at that time, so he could chill and pursue more relaxed personal ventures.
1032400	1037040	One of his friends, Woody's gamertag, posted a podcast called the Painkiller Podcast, on which
1037040	1042880	Kyle was a regular co-host. On this side of the internet, he was just known as Kyle, and the Russian accent was gone.
1043040	1046880	Yeah, of course, we have a few sponsors tonight, Smartmouth, of course, making its return, as well as
1046880	1052480	Lyft, Zip Recruiter, and Jack Threads, and MeUndies, so you can check them out down in the description below.
1052480	1057120	I'm gonna talk about each of them more later on, but for now, let's just start the show.
1057120	1061760	It's hard to say it was anything particularly exhilarating, but I think it was entertaining enough,
1061760	1066960	and Kyle seemed to be having fun, so that's what matters. The podcast itself probably generates a
1066960	1071280	decent amount of income due to the number of sponsors, and Kyle typically did the readings.
1071280	1075920	He still does a fair few episodes there now, so if you're wondering where to find him, that's where
1075920	1081520	you can go. However, if it was the end of the story, the arc would be incomplete, because as said,
1081520	1086080	since the death of Keith Ratliff, the police have probably been glancing in his direction a bit more
1086080	1091200	than they normally would. As mentioned, if the opportunity arose to raid his property again,
1091200	1096720	they would. Unfortunately, that opportunity did, and after receiving a tip-off that Kyle had imported
1096800	1101760	25 grams of butane hash oil through the mail, which was a pretty bad idea to be honest,
1101760	1108000	law officials moved in on Kyle and his residents once more in August of 2017. I have little doubt
1108000	1111760	that this was in part due to the hope that they thought they'd maybe find something they hadn't
1111760	1116640	before, and their search of Kyle's residence extended to looking for weapons and explosives.
1116640	1120560	As he was charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, they removed these
1120560	1125360	weapons due to a statute that prevented illegal drug users from owning them. Honestly, I'm
1125360	1132720	disappointed. I can't think of a better combination than guns and weed. Am I right kids? I'm so hip.
1132720	1137840	I have a hunch the feds in general didn't really approve of Kyle's operations, and they were aware
1137840	1142320	that having a criminal record would prevent him from owning and thus using firearms again.
1142320	1145920	I feel that this and the next part is going to undermine the theory that the police were
1145920	1150240	protecting him in any way, because I don't think they liked him, and what he subsequently went
1150240	1154080	down for was pretty bizarre, so let's talk about it.
1163040	1167280	The state attorney accumulated a list of crimes that they felt our good friend Kyle here was
1167280	1171920	culpable for. These crimes included possession with intent to distribute marijuana and butane
1171920	1177120	honey oil, maintaining a drug premises, possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number,
1177120	1182480	and possession of a firearm by a drug user. That's a lot to digest. Now, the possession with intent
1182480	1188240	to distribute charge is the main charge that we'll focus on, as a felony it incurs up to 30 years in
1188240	1192960	prison, which would not have been a good outcome for anyone. However, the severity of these penalties
1192960	1197120	are known to be highly dependent on the circumstances surrounding them, and Kyle didn't
1197120	1202480	have a previous criminal record, nor was he some drug kingpin. In fact, according to a later podcast
1202480	1205600	after he was released on bail, it seemed to be quite the contrary.
1218800	1224960	Providing what he says is true here, law enforcement's reasoning is ridiculous, it's a piss take. However, as
1224960	1229920	noted, this was not the only charge, and the others may have carried significant punishment if he was
1229920	1234400	found guilty, which seemed like a plausible enough possibility for Kyle to vow to what is probably
1234400	1239520	known as a plea deal, or plea bargain. This plea deal basically meant that the latter three charges
1239520	1244240	that he was facing were completely dropped, and he was only sentenced on the basis of possession
1244240	1249600	of drugs with the intent to distribute, which to me still seemed kind of daft. Kyle was prosecuted
1249600	1254560	at a federal level as according to him, the state screwed their case up because they legitimised a
1254560	1259840	warrant on the basis that Kyle was wearing cargo shorts, which as a fashion choice implied he was
1259840	1265360	going back to his house with the marijuana. Let's be clear, they wanted to search the house.
1265360	1270080	If what he says is true, which it may well be given the leniency of the subsequent sentence,
1270080	1274240	I think he may have had a chance at fighting the case, but on the other hand, he knows the
1274240	1279200	environment of Georgia better than me, and given some of these charges seem stacked up, I understand
1279200	1284800	why he cut a deal, though once again, it all seems like a bit of a stitch up. I get why plea deals
1284800	1290000	exist, it just sucks that a possibly innocent party may be coerced into that position due to
1290000	1296080	the incentive of having other cases dropped. I hate it. I hate that system. On the other hand,
1296080	1301360	the fact that he did cut a deal makes me wonder if he ever intended to return to FPS Russia.
1301360	1306720	If he was prepared to blow up vehicles in his proximity, I'm sure he didn't mind a risk or two
1306720	1311360	here and there if it was something worth fighting for. Although the criminal record sucks, and I'm
1311360	1316320	sure legal advice factored into it to a degree, in hindsight he seemed fairly unphased talking
1316320	1319440	about it, reflecting on it like an entertaining story.
1346320	1365360	For the record, if you want to hear Karl's prison stories, I'll definitely leave a link in the pinned
1365360	1370480	comment below, it's surprisingly entertaining and often endearing. Ultimately, he was sentenced to
1370480	1376880	2 months in prison with supervised release, and an additional fine of $7,500, because they needed
1376880	1382720	some money from it as well I guess. He was charged in 2019, went to jail in around August, and got out
1382720	1388720	in October, like any other year really. So what's he up to now? Well, Karl's just chillin'. In spite of
1388720	1391520	everything, he's taken it quite well.
1391520	1420160	With that said, a lot of his stories can be quite concerning, particularly given how he talks about
1420160	1425200	his involvement with various seriously criminal individuals in prison. For someone like Karl, given
1425200	1430240	his success, it's not a huge deal, but it does illuminate a lot of issues with what happens when you put
1430240	1436160	someone in jail for a rather minor crime with a set of fairly serious criminals, and it does highlight some
1436160	1441360	of the issues with the prison system. If you want something interesting, yet somewhat enlightening,
1441360	1446320	definitely check those videos out. Most people know my politics as pretty anti-drug criminalization,
1446320	1450400	particularly drugs like marijuana, which when I studied in the Netherlands basically surrounded me,
1450400	1454960	and I was never really much of a user myself, but the environment that I resided in was fairly
1454960	1460240	harmonized, and so although it was a lot of THC oil, and Karl should have definitely known better given the
1460240	1465680	location he chose to reside in, and the culture being incumbent with that, it's a real shame that the laws
1465680	1472000	to me seem so harsh on him, because of this marijuana he lost the equivalent of $400,000 of
1472000	1478320	itinerary. I respect him for being honestly as placid as he is, I'm not sure I would be.
1478320	1482000	What do they do with the guns? They just hold on to them? Put them in a big vault somewhere?
1482000	1483360	Probably destroy them.
1483360	1484880	Oh, that's a shame.
1484880	1486400	Let's conclude then.
1486400	1491680	FPS Russia has its success rooted in the origins of that old generation of YouTube where people
1491680	1496800	embraced the chaos, and as Shao deserved to thrive as a product of that. But what was entertainment
1496800	1501600	eventually became quite real in a way that few could have anticipated. What followed was a
1501600	1506400	butterfly effect that destabilized a channel already somewhat fragile in the evolving environment,
1506400	1511600	and the man at the center of it. The channel's reliance on the character of Dimitri, as iconic
1511600	1516800	as he is, made the issues he faced concurrent with the ones that the channel faced. It cast a shadow
1516800	1522240	that everyone struggled to escape, and many refused to forget. It led to the eyes of drama detectives
1522240	1526640	and law enforcement who lay in wait for whatever opportunity they were yielded, and although you
1526640	1531200	could argue that Karl could have been more conscious of the risks, he couldn't live the rest of his life
1531200	1536000	looking over his shoulder, and maybe that's why he doesn't appear to care as much, maybe a burden
1536000	1541040	of sorts has been lifted. Hopefully sometime in the future, in a different environment, he'll have his
1541040	1547680	legal restrictions re-evaluated. I genuinely hope so. In a way, I do feel sad that they took so much
1547680	1552480	away from the channel, because even if you weren't using it anymore, it'd be nice to know it's there,
1552480	1557920	you know, in case you wanted to do a little special for the fans, and of course the value too.
1557920	1563120	There must have been some sentimental connection, or he probably would have sold it. It sucked.
1563120	1568960	Innocence prevailing in other situations, he deserved better, and I hope there is justice in the end,
1568960	1574400	for everything and everyone discussed today. For the moment, I hope he's happier with where he is now,
1574400	1581040	and as enshrined as it is, FPS Russia was a product of its time, and one whose time has probably passed.
1581040	1588640	To those who enjoyed it, well, don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.
1589840	1596400	You already knew how to shoot this shit. Hope you guys enjoyed the video, and as always, have a nice day.
1600400	1606320	So that was the video, I hope you enjoyed it, I think I enjoyed it. It was a bit shorter than
1606320	1611120	normal, but honestly, sometimes we have to moderate the time we spend on these things.
1611120	1616320	I started another video, and basically that one had some new information that I decided that actually
1616320	1621600	we should leave that a bit more, let it brew, and we'll act on that later. So I thought we'd do a
1621600	1626880	little retrospective on something that I do genuinely find quite interesting, and I hope that interest showed.
1626880	1633520	I wanted to give a big shoutout to my editors, once again, they have done a fantastic job,
1633600	1638400	I can't really thank them enough, they just do great work time after time, and it's great to know that I can rely on
1638400	1644000	people to make content that's entertaining for so many people. I also want to give a big shoutout to my
1644000	1651120	Patreons, current Patreons, at the time of the recording, November of course, is my $10 Patreons up on screen
1651120	1658480	right now, $50 Patreons, Sumhala Baloo, Nico Deschamps, and Caroline, and my $100 Patreons.
1658560	1665760	We have a new Patreon, who hopefully, I'm putting my faith into, for the pledge to go through at the end of the month,
1665760	1671360	Stanton, thank you very much, man, it really makes a difference. I also wanted to give a big thanks to Brandon,
1671360	1677680	someone who I still don't know who he is, his pledge has now, lifetime pledge has hit $1000, which honestly is
1677680	1683520	incredible, and I can't thank you enough, man, if you're watching this, love you, I hope you still take
1683520	1687760	something away from my videos, I hope you haven't spontaneously died or something, that would be terrible.
1687760	1696080	Also, if you wanna hit me up, Twitter, at The Right Opinion, Discord, and of course, Facebook, though I don't use
1696080	1701280	that right now, I'm gonna try and get back on it, it's all been a bit messy recently, I need to be a bit more
1701280	1707360	organised, also my Instagram, which is basically a bit more personal, if you wanna know what I'm up to, what I'm
1707360	1715360	doing, typically writing, scripting, talking like this, editing, or playing just dance, because you know me,
1715360	1720160	great dancer, and I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
