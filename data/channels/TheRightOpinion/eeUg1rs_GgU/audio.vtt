00:00.000 --> 00:10.600
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

00:10.600 --> 00:15.760
and I hope you're enjoying living in the modern era of YouTube, though you probably aren't.

00:15.760 --> 00:21.800
However, for today's topic, we removed the prim and proper suits of modern YouTube, and donned the trackies and overcoats.

00:21.800 --> 00:27.160
Yes, we're bringing out the big guns. Let's hop in the Tro-Time machine and head back to 2012,

00:27.160 --> 00:31.000
the time when a very unique gentleman was at the pinnacle of YouTube.

00:33.880 --> 00:40.920
This is a man known as FPS Russia. Now, he isn't spoken too much about these days, but you know, I think he should be.

00:40.920 --> 00:47.080
It's hard to think of a better example of a creator who could make content catered to popular interest while uploading videos

00:47.080 --> 00:50.880
whose style probably wouldn't have worked on any other platform besides YouTube.

00:50.880 --> 00:56.560
Yes, I have a hunch if the gents over at Sons of Gun suddenly started putting on slightly subpar Russian accents,

00:56.600 --> 01:01.800
the producers over at the Discovery Channel would have been rather unimpressed, though honestly, I think they would have taken that

01:01.800 --> 01:04.600
rather than actually what happened to the host of that show.

01:04.600 --> 01:10.520
However, for those who are a bit newer to the platform, you may not be completely familiar with the background of today's subject,

01:10.520 --> 01:15.920
Kyle Myers or FPS Russia, so the next five minutes also will be focused on that.

01:16.920 --> 01:25.840
Like a large majority of creators, FPS Russia had an extensive history on the platform, starting on the extremely catchy name of KLM5986.

01:25.840 --> 01:31.720
He was originally a gaming channel who went by the name of FPS Kyle. I assume at some point he came to this idea of,

01:31.720 --> 01:38.920
well, what would happen if I did gaming but with a Russian accent, and thus FPS Russia was born, because initially FPS Russia

01:38.920 --> 01:43.280
was actually also a gaming channel, a gaming channel that performed relatively well, mind you.

01:43.280 --> 01:48.280
Hell, in one of the old screenshots I'd found, there was even an old comment saying that he was about to blow up.

01:48.280 --> 01:52.000
And boy, did he, though probably not in the way that people predicted.

01:52.320 --> 02:00.720
Playing like this make many people very angry. They send me lots of angry messages and send me mean text messages,

02:00.720 --> 02:08.360
mean voicemail, and I just laugh and laugh. It is very, very funny to get the hate mail from the bitches.

02:08.360 --> 02:13.440
Apparently finding out that this accent was fake was like finding out Santa wasn't real.

02:13.440 --> 02:19.120
Well kids, if you're watching this, Santa is as real as this accent. Do what you want with that statement.

02:19.160 --> 02:24.840
Not too long after his gaming ventures, Kyle decided to expand his content, attempting more creative sketches,

02:24.840 --> 02:30.680
most of which are long gone, although I was moderately taken aback by one named I love very young girls,

02:30.680 --> 02:36.960
alongside some very timely top comments. The glory days of YouTube have truly passed us by.

02:36.960 --> 02:43.280
At some point he must have noticed that certain weapon related content was performing significantly better than the rest of his uploads,

02:43.280 --> 02:47.960
and he decided to focus on pursuing that as a brand, a justified business decision.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.520
The videos that are currently on his channel definitely represent that brand in the most accurate possible way.

02:53.520 --> 02:57.320
With FPS Russia, you would receive a first class ticket to the gun show.

02:57.320 --> 03:02.920
His videos typically exhibited a variety of weapons and stunts based around the discharge of such content.

03:02.920 --> 03:10.520
It was punchy, entertaining, and strangely satisfying for a multitude of reasons, all mixed in with that slightly eccentric persona.

03:10.520 --> 03:15.000
It was a recipe for success, and in the coming years he experienced just that.

03:15.040 --> 03:21.880
He became one of the most popular YouTubers on the platform, at one point being the third most subscribed channel on the whole of YouTube.

03:21.880 --> 03:28.360
He appeared in related media, including an ad for Call of Duty Black Ops 2 alongside Robert Downey Jr,

03:28.360 --> 03:34.640
and he even launched his own app, FPS Russia The Game, after a highly successful Kickstarter campaign.

03:34.640 --> 03:40.560
He was more than just a guy shooting guns, he was a real personality, and he played into that.

03:45.000 --> 03:55.000
It was pretty damn genius, the persona was a simplistic Russian guy which worked incredibly well because of the limited spoken content.

03:55.000 --> 04:03.520
He would keep it simple, shut up, and shoot his gun, and not bother with too many technicalities that a majority of people probably wouldn't be the most interested in.

04:03.520 --> 04:09.840
He knew primarily to focus on the sensation of shooting guns, at the same time his persona complemented it well,

04:09.840 --> 04:16.240
it was a stereotype, and in many ways he appealed to stereotypical mannerisms that made the content enjoyable,

04:16.240 --> 04:18.960
and appeared alongside those who emboldened that.

04:18.960 --> 04:26.080
I assume most people know what an exploitation film is, it's something that works to cater to trends in the most obscene way possible.

04:26.080 --> 04:31.760
FPS Russia took some of those elements and combined it with the realism that people expected of a YouTube video,

04:31.760 --> 04:34.640
and created something grounded yet impactful.

04:34.640 --> 04:41.920
Oh yeah, give me that slo-mo baby, you love to see it.

04:44.920 --> 04:49.520
At its core, FPS Russia's videos were the perfect balance of amateur and professional.

04:49.520 --> 04:54.000
He's a bloke with a bit too much firepower, but at the same time, he's got a bloody tank.

04:54.000 --> 05:03.520
Point is, you needed some balls and some money to do what he did, however, to be such a public yet seemingly unprotected figure participating in hazardous activities

05:03.520 --> 05:10.320
on this relatively unknown, uncensored platform places you in a position where you may be in the sight of multiple parties,

05:10.320 --> 05:15.680
all willing to take their own shots, and when you're such a large target, you're gonna catch a couple bullets,

05:15.680 --> 05:19.200
and that's what we're going to be discussing today.

05:19.200 --> 05:26.720
As of November-December 2019, I don't know when this video will be out, his child sits dormant, untouched for over three years,

05:26.720 --> 05:31.840
and it wasn't because he ran out of money or balls, no, I don't think that will be a problem for him.

05:31.920 --> 05:38.160
It's a complicated story that, whatever way you look at it, started in 2013, and when you uncover the details,

05:38.160 --> 05:47.440
you'll find the sudden demise of a channel embodied in drama, conspiracy theories, death, prison, and actually some interesting sociopolitical discourse.

05:47.440 --> 05:54.640
So we're gonna do all that today, and hopefully more, so we can find out about the curious fate of FPS Russia.

05:54.960 --> 06:00.240
See, I said the title, that makes me clever, hahaha.

06:00.240 --> 06:04.960
Let us embark on this most mysterious journey, let's set the ship to full mast.

06:07.680 --> 06:12.560
For this next part, I'll be putting some of my more morbid murder interest to the grindstone.

06:12.560 --> 06:18.240
With that said, this is also a disclaimer because, although relevant, it also touches on some sensitive topics.

06:18.240 --> 06:21.200
So without further ado, let's dim the lights.

06:21.280 --> 06:26.160
FPS Russia wasn't a single person project. Now, I'm sure that'll surprise no one,

06:26.160 --> 06:31.600
it'd take a lot of time and ability to obtain all his equipment, organize film crews, edit, and so on,

06:31.600 --> 06:34.800
and the bottom line is that people just want to see the final results.

06:34.800 --> 06:38.160
This is where we introduce you to someone by the name of Keith Ratliff.

06:38.160 --> 06:43.040
Keith Richard Ratliff was a gun enthusiast, husband, and father hailing from Kentucky,

06:43.040 --> 06:46.320
but also someone fairly involved in the FPS Russia YouTube channel.

06:46.320 --> 06:50.720
The extent of his involvement seems uncertain, some people claiming that he was merely a member

06:50.720 --> 06:55.120
of the production team, whereas many closer to Ratliff claiming he was one of the co-founders

06:55.120 --> 06:59.760
of the channel itself. This latter assertion would have surprised me given the nature of the channel

06:59.760 --> 07:04.880
when it was originally founded, but maybe he became heavily involved not too soon after.

07:04.880 --> 07:09.760
One detail that was uncontested was the role he played in the channel, often obtaining extremely

07:09.760 --> 07:14.240
rare and otherwise inaccessible weaponry. He had previously worked as a marketing manager,

07:14.240 --> 07:18.640
and had even attempted online ventures before, such as his ownership of the website known as

07:18.640 --> 07:26.160
Sotastic.com, a marketing-oriented business. In November 2011, he co-founded FPS Industries LLC,

07:26.160 --> 07:31.520
which combined Keith's marketing expertise with his love for firearms. In February of 2012,

07:31.520 --> 07:37.200
he moved from Kentucky to Carnesville, Georgia. I assume this was in part because FPS Industries LLC

07:37.200 --> 07:42.000
was also a Type 10 destructors manufacturer, which is a high-level license for those who wish to

07:42.000 --> 07:45.920
produce and deal with destructive devices, ammunition for those destructive devices,

07:45.920 --> 07:50.800
armor-piercing ammunition, and other various weaponry. It cost them money to apply and renew

07:50.800 --> 07:55.280
every now and then, and as far as it is published on their Facebook page, Keith was the one with the

07:55.280 --> 07:59.200
license. There are a load of additional technicalities and licenses that you will

07:59.200 --> 08:03.760
likely have to apply for, but it's understandable that Ratliff wanted to move closer to the source

08:03.760 --> 08:08.240
of this income, so he left his family in Kentucky to pursue this business venture and the many

08:08.240 --> 08:12.800
successes that it could yield. Keith also had a YouTube channel at one point called Guns,

08:12.800 --> 08:18.160
Guns, and More Guns, though its name changed a few times. This channel has also since been closed.

08:18.160 --> 08:24.080
He also ran the FPS Industries LLC Facebook page. He was just stereotypical gun-loving man.

08:24.080 --> 08:29.040
He had ambitions, dreams, and Obama memes. Everything moved fairly smoothly for just shy

08:29.040 --> 08:33.840
of a year. The YouTube channels excelled, and the business seemed to have decent traffic as well.

08:33.840 --> 08:38.480
However, barely a few days into the new year, on the 4th of January 2013,

08:38.480 --> 08:43.040
he was discovered deceased with a single gunshot wound to the head. There were a lot of guns

08:43.040 --> 08:46.880
surrounding him, but not the one that was responsible for his death. There was no sign

08:46.880 --> 08:51.840
of a struggle, no sign of a break-in, a few guns were missing, but nothing that would amount to

08:51.840 --> 08:55.840
a theft being the motive. The surveillance equipment was missing as well, so unfortunately,

08:55.840 --> 09:00.080
the crime wasn't captured. It was a pretty sparse crime scene, and although there was a lot of

09:00.160 --> 09:04.400
initial attention on the case, with the state of Georgia police releasing a statement regarding

09:04.400 --> 09:10.080
these circumstances, it died down fairly rapidly and left a lot of unanswered questions behind.

09:10.080 --> 09:13.840
At the time, there was a lot of confusion with some people thinking Kyle was actually the one

09:13.840 --> 09:18.080
who had been killed, which wasn't the case, and there was also this claim that Keith had been

09:18.080 --> 09:24.080
tied up prior to being shot. This was also untrue. With all the details considered, many people felt

09:24.080 --> 09:28.800
like the person who had murdered Keith must have known him, especially given the lack of otherwise

09:28.800 --> 09:32.800
clear motive. It felt like it would have needed to be something more personal, or at least

09:32.800 --> 09:37.040
premeditated. He also hadn't been living in Georgia too long, so it had to be someone

09:37.040 --> 09:41.600
relatively current in his life. There were also some pretty wild conspiracy theories,

09:41.600 --> 09:45.440
some wondering if he'd been targeted by the government or a gun control group,

09:45.440 --> 09:50.080
due to his glorification of gun culture and outspoken criticism of gun control.

09:50.080 --> 09:56.000
Most of you can't. That should be illegal. Every one of you should be able to own an assault weapon

09:56.000 --> 10:01.360
of your choice, because that's what the Second Amendment in America is about. It's about owning

10:01.920 --> 10:08.800
weaponry to allow you to defend oneself from all enemies, no matter where they arise from.

10:08.800 --> 10:13.200
However, in both these instances, you'd think that the groups would have been more direct and

10:13.200 --> 10:17.600
would have made more of an example of him, though the government wouldn't, but I think the government

10:17.680 --> 10:21.920
have other things to deal with. Another theory that was floating around was the idea that this

10:21.920 --> 10:27.360
was an arms deal gone wrong, and although the Type 10 license did give Ratliff an extensive amount

10:27.360 --> 10:31.440
of power to trade within the industry, the proof substantiating these theories is weak.

10:31.440 --> 10:36.400
Ultimately, the relevancy of this saga is that regardless of who committed the crime, the unsolved

10:36.400 --> 10:41.280
nature hanging over the head of the community set an uncomfortable spotlight on anyone in the

10:41.280 --> 10:46.080
vicinity, particularly those with an arsenal of weapons. The truth is that many people close to

10:46.080 --> 10:51.680
Ratliff had one person in mind, and that was Kyle. Statements made by those from the Justice for

10:51.680 --> 10:56.320
Keith Ratliff pressure group, and even in their petition, clearly alludes to the idea that Kyle

10:56.320 --> 11:00.400
was the individual who committed the crime, and that the police hadn't acted on it due to the

11:00.400 --> 11:06.240
fact that Ratliff wasn't from around those parts, and Kyle was. As a business partner, someone who

11:06.240 --> 11:10.560
knew the environment, and as someone whom Keith would have trusted, there are certain circumstances

11:10.560 --> 11:15.600
that may have made this a more fitting theory, but there's also a significant lack of public motive,

11:15.600 --> 11:20.160
and given Keith's value to the business, it would have seemed an exceptionally ill-advised move.

11:20.160 --> 11:24.240
I don't really want to focus on the theory, but it's important to note how this would have affected

11:24.240 --> 11:29.920
the channel, a channel focused primarily on the utility of dangerous weapons. Keith was important,

11:29.920 --> 11:34.000
and this incident would have struck fear into a lot of people associated with the channel given

11:34.000 --> 11:40.720
the unknown perpetrator and motive. Uncertainty is a curse. What's worse is that given his proximity,

11:40.720 --> 11:45.040
regardless of the verifiability, it was inevitable that Kyle, regardless of motive,

11:45.040 --> 11:49.520
was going to be one of the key suspects, and Keith's untimely murder put Kyle on the police

11:49.520 --> 11:54.720
radar in a way that affected his trade. Less than two months later, federal agents from the ATF,

11:54.720 --> 12:00.160
alongside the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, raided his and his father's place. While the ATF

12:00.160 --> 12:04.800
claimed it was for unrelated issues regarding explosives, the sheriff claimed it was regarding

12:04.800 --> 12:09.920
the murder, the legal side being as coherent as ever. It was never said if anything of value was

12:09.920 --> 12:14.480
actually taken, although Kyle was reported to have been charged with anything. Nonetheless,

12:14.480 --> 12:20.720
the raid was probably quite stressful, and it was followed by an extended hiatus until his return in 2014.

12:20.720 --> 12:25.520
And it has been a very long time since we've uploaded the video, and it's been a while since

12:25.520 --> 12:31.600
I've posted on social media as well, and I wanted to first of all explain that I've been through so

12:31.600 --> 12:36.560
many times where I've been trying to set up production days, working with film crews, working

12:36.560 --> 12:41.440
with high-speed stuff, and everything fell through, and I kept telling everyone, we'll have a video in

12:41.440 --> 12:47.920
a week, we'll have a video in a month, and that was based on promises that had been made to me.

12:47.920 --> 12:53.280
Then when those promises get broken, I look like the liar, so I wanted to wait until I had everything

12:53.280 --> 13:00.720
ready, had several videos in the bank, and we're there now. So first things first, we've got a very

13:00.720 --> 13:09.760
nice 12 gauge. But hey, at least he was back, right? Right? Well, unfortunately, it's never really over.

13:09.760 --> 13:22.320
The whole situation regarding the death of Keith Ratliff was a blight on everyone involved,

13:22.320 --> 13:26.880
particularly given that it was unresolved. The variety of theories couldn't really change the people

13:26.880 --> 13:31.600
who were closest to him at the time. One of the biggest issues is that our friend Kyle probably

13:31.600 --> 13:36.160
anticipated that the police were under some sort of pressure to solve the crime, and that given his

13:36.160 --> 13:40.960
public YouTube channel, he was playing with fire in more ways than one. However, he couldn't risk

13:40.960 --> 13:46.320
compromising his business, it was still incredibly successful, he still had an audience, and he still

13:46.320 --> 13:53.440
had a demand. So as noted in 2014, around 9 months after the raid of his house, he returned triumphantly

13:53.440 --> 13:58.880
and resumed his content. Now, I'd say he's not really afraid of taking risks, so I doubt it was the most

13:58.880 --> 14:04.080
difficult decision at that point. And besides, at that point, the feds had done a sweep, there wasn't

14:04.080 --> 14:09.040
very much else they could expect to find. However, many police departments may attempt to find reasons

14:09.040 --> 14:14.400
to return to the residence of a suspect later on, in case the subject in question had temporarily

14:14.400 --> 14:19.120
moved certain suspicious items and returned them at a later date. Therefore, the police would have

14:19.120 --> 14:24.160
no hesitation in returning if granted the opportunity. Of course, they would need suspicious

14:24.160 --> 14:29.520
activity to justify a warrant, and although one would describe FPS Russia's activities as

14:29.520 --> 14:34.320
particularly regular, in the context of what he did with his channel, it was hard to frame it as

14:34.320 --> 14:39.680
criminally suspicious. Nonetheless, even after his return, a lot of the YouTube mystery persisted in

14:39.680 --> 14:45.040
the world of FPS Russia, a lot of internet detectives didn't let off, people trying to work out who

14:45.040 --> 14:50.240
had murdered Keith Ratliff as if they were going to bust open the case, and in spite of understandable

14:50.240 --> 14:55.120
irritation from the team at FPS Industries, they eventually granted one interview with Kyle,

14:55.120 --> 14:58.880
with conditions prevailing that the questions were sent in advance.

14:58.880 --> 15:05.360
As far as why he was killed, you know, who's to say? I loved Keith, Keith was my buddy, Keith had been my friend

15:05.360 --> 15:12.000
for a couple of years, we travelled the country together, so it's hard for me to say, oh yeah, this person

15:12.000 --> 15:16.480
or that person, you know, everybody's got enemies I suppose, people who don't care for the way they do

15:16.480 --> 15:21.680
things, you know, he had a, he had a rocky personal life with women, you know, I know he'd had some

15:21.680 --> 15:27.760
trouble in business in the past, but nothing that would bring something like this, you know, at least

15:27.760 --> 15:32.240
we wouldn't think so, so no idea, it's uh, no idea.

15:32.240 --> 15:37.520
I don't really have too much to add here, what I know about Keith didn't extend to such matters, but I can

15:37.520 --> 15:41.600
understand why he didn't want to make further comments. At the same time, it's good to have a

15:41.600 --> 15:46.480
statement out there for reference, this interview was part of another documentary that framed Kyle

15:46.480 --> 15:50.320
fairly negatively, and to be honest, although he maybe should have turned up at some of the prior

15:50.320 --> 15:55.280
interviews, if I was in his shoes, I'd probably be a bit frustrated about the situation persisting in

15:55.280 --> 16:00.240
the way it had, it's hard to conclude anything, the video is called Who Killed Keith Ratliff?, and all

16:00.240 --> 16:05.520
you conclude is that no one had a bloody clue. Over the time period, the regularity of uploads

16:05.520 --> 16:11.920
became more and more sporadic, and in April 2016, FPS Russia published his final video, one where he

16:11.920 --> 16:16.960
tested out some very nice flamethrowers. These videos seemed fairly routine in nature, and nothing

16:16.960 --> 16:22.320
was identifiably wrong, it's unclear as to why he exactly stopped at that point, screenshots in the

16:22.320 --> 16:27.200
months prior showed his channel not performing too well, but still somewhat decently, though obviously

16:27.200 --> 16:31.520
such weapons wouldn't have been particularly cheap to own. Also, another really important thing to note

16:31.520 --> 16:36.640
was that this was around the time of the apocalypse, and honestly, it's hard to see how a channel like

16:36.640 --> 16:42.000
his would have received many liberties. It sucks, because on principle, he's not a terrorist, and what

16:42.000 --> 16:47.280
he does isn't particularly exceptional to many shows you'd see on TV, but for creators who deal with

16:47.280 --> 16:52.560
any sort of weaponry, the mere sight of them in 2016 would have probably given the lads over at

16:52.560 --> 16:58.400
Googleplex an aneurysm. Unfortunately, what FPS Russia did was high risk, high reward, and I have a

16:58.480 --> 17:03.440
hunch that although he was never really afraid of the risk, the reward came with diminishing returns.

17:03.440 --> 17:07.680
Nonetheless, his presence from YouTube didn't completely disappear, it's likely that he had made

17:07.680 --> 17:12.400
a fair amount of money at that time, so he could chill and pursue more relaxed personal ventures.

17:12.400 --> 17:17.040
One of his friends, Woody's gamertag, posted a podcast called the Painkiller Podcast, on which

17:17.040 --> 17:22.880
Kyle was a regular co-host. On this side of the internet, he was just known as Kyle, and the Russian accent was gone.

17:23.040 --> 17:26.880
Yeah, of course, we have a few sponsors tonight, Smartmouth, of course, making its return, as well as

17:26.880 --> 17:32.480
Lyft, Zip Recruiter, and Jack Threads, and MeUndies, so you can check them out down in the description below.

17:32.480 --> 17:37.120
I'm gonna talk about each of them more later on, but for now, let's just start the show.

17:37.120 --> 17:41.760
It's hard to say it was anything particularly exhilarating, but I think it was entertaining enough,

17:41.760 --> 17:46.960
and Kyle seemed to be having fun, so that's what matters. The podcast itself probably generates a

17:46.960 --> 17:51.280
decent amount of income due to the number of sponsors, and Kyle typically did the readings.

17:51.280 --> 17:55.920
He still does a fair few episodes there now, so if you're wondering where to find him, that's where

17:55.920 --> 18:01.520
you can go. However, if it was the end of the story, the arc would be incomplete, because as said,

18:01.520 --> 18:06.080
since the death of Keith Ratliff, the police have probably been glancing in his direction a bit more

18:06.080 --> 18:11.200
than they normally would. As mentioned, if the opportunity arose to raid his property again,

18:11.200 --> 18:16.720
they would. Unfortunately, that opportunity did, and after receiving a tip-off that Kyle had imported

18:16.800 --> 18:21.760
25 grams of butane hash oil through the mail, which was a pretty bad idea to be honest,

18:21.760 --> 18:28.000
law officials moved in on Kyle and his residents once more in August of 2017. I have little doubt

18:28.000 --> 18:31.760
that this was in part due to the hope that they thought they'd maybe find something they hadn't

18:31.760 --> 18:36.640
before, and their search of Kyle's residence extended to looking for weapons and explosives.

18:36.640 --> 18:40.560
As he was charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, they removed these

18:40.560 --> 18:45.360
weapons due to a statute that prevented illegal drug users from owning them. Honestly, I'm

18:45.360 --> 18:52.720
disappointed. I can't think of a better combination than guns and weed. Am I right kids? I'm so hip.

18:52.720 --> 18:57.840
I have a hunch the feds in general didn't really approve of Kyle's operations, and they were aware

18:57.840 --> 19:02.320
that having a criminal record would prevent him from owning and thus using firearms again.

19:02.320 --> 19:05.920
I feel that this and the next part is going to undermine the theory that the police were

19:05.920 --> 19:10.240
protecting him in any way, because I don't think they liked him, and what he subsequently went

19:10.240 --> 19:14.080
down for was pretty bizarre, so let's talk about it.

19:23.040 --> 19:27.280
The state attorney accumulated a list of crimes that they felt our good friend Kyle here was

19:27.280 --> 19:31.920
culpable for. These crimes included possession with intent to distribute marijuana and butane

19:31.920 --> 19:37.120
honey oil, maintaining a drug premises, possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number,

19:37.120 --> 19:42.480
and possession of a firearm by a drug user. That's a lot to digest. Now, the possession with intent

19:42.480 --> 19:48.240
to distribute charge is the main charge that we'll focus on, as a felony it incurs up to 30 years in

19:48.240 --> 19:52.960
prison, which would not have been a good outcome for anyone. However, the severity of these penalties

19:52.960 --> 19:57.120
are known to be highly dependent on the circumstances surrounding them, and Kyle didn't

19:57.120 --> 20:02.480
have a previous criminal record, nor was he some drug kingpin. In fact, according to a later podcast

20:02.480 --> 20:05.600
after he was released on bail, it seemed to be quite the contrary.

20:18.800 --> 20:24.960
Providing what he says is true here, law enforcement's reasoning is ridiculous, it's a piss take. However, as

20:24.960 --> 20:29.920
noted, this was not the only charge, and the others may have carried significant punishment if he was

20:29.920 --> 20:34.400
found guilty, which seemed like a plausible enough possibility for Kyle to vow to what is probably

20:34.400 --> 20:39.520
known as a plea deal, or plea bargain. This plea deal basically meant that the latter three charges

20:39.520 --> 20:44.240
that he was facing were completely dropped, and he was only sentenced on the basis of possession

20:44.240 --> 20:49.600
of drugs with the intent to distribute, which to me still seemed kind of daft. Kyle was prosecuted

20:49.600 --> 20:54.560
at a federal level as according to him, the state screwed their case up because they legitimised a

20:54.560 --> 20:59.840
warrant on the basis that Kyle was wearing cargo shorts, which as a fashion choice implied he was

20:59.840 --> 21:05.360
going back to his house with the marijuana. Let's be clear, they wanted to search the house.

21:05.360 --> 21:10.080
If what he says is true, which it may well be given the leniency of the subsequent sentence,

21:10.080 --> 21:14.240
I think he may have had a chance at fighting the case, but on the other hand, he knows the

21:14.240 --> 21:19.200
environment of Georgia better than me, and given some of these charges seem stacked up, I understand

21:19.200 --> 21:24.800
why he cut a deal, though once again, it all seems like a bit of a stitch up. I get why plea deals

21:24.800 --> 21:30.000
exist, it just sucks that a possibly innocent party may be coerced into that position due to

21:30.000 --> 21:36.080
the incentive of having other cases dropped. I hate it. I hate that system. On the other hand,

21:36.080 --> 21:41.360
the fact that he did cut a deal makes me wonder if he ever intended to return to FPS Russia.

21:41.360 --> 21:46.720
If he was prepared to blow up vehicles in his proximity, I'm sure he didn't mind a risk or two

21:46.720 --> 21:51.360
here and there if it was something worth fighting for. Although the criminal record sucks, and I'm

21:51.360 --> 21:56.320
sure legal advice factored into it to a degree, in hindsight he seemed fairly unphased talking

21:56.320 --> 21:59.440
about it, reflecting on it like an entertaining story.

22:26.320 --> 22:45.360
For the record, if you want to hear Karl's prison stories, I'll definitely leave a link in the pinned

22:45.360 --> 22:50.480
comment below, it's surprisingly entertaining and often endearing. Ultimately, he was sentenced to

22:50.480 --> 22:56.880
2 months in prison with supervised release, and an additional fine of $7,500, because they needed

22:56.880 --> 23:02.720
some money from it as well I guess. He was charged in 2019, went to jail in around August, and got out

23:02.720 --> 23:08.720
in October, like any other year really. So what's he up to now? Well, Karl's just chillin'. In spite of

23:08.720 --> 23:11.520
everything, he's taken it quite well.

23:11.520 --> 23:40.160
With that said, a lot of his stories can be quite concerning, particularly given how he talks about

23:40.160 --> 23:45.200
his involvement with various seriously criminal individuals in prison. For someone like Karl, given

23:45.200 --> 23:50.240
his success, it's not a huge deal, but it does illuminate a lot of issues with what happens when you put

23:50.240 --> 23:56.160
someone in jail for a rather minor crime with a set of fairly serious criminals, and it does highlight some

23:56.160 --> 24:01.360
of the issues with the prison system. If you want something interesting, yet somewhat enlightening,

24:01.360 --> 24:06.320
definitely check those videos out. Most people know my politics as pretty anti-drug criminalization,

24:06.320 --> 24:10.400
particularly drugs like marijuana, which when I studied in the Netherlands basically surrounded me,

24:10.400 --> 24:14.960
and I was never really much of a user myself, but the environment that I resided in was fairly

24:14.960 --> 24:20.240
harmonized, and so although it was a lot of THC oil, and Karl should have definitely known better given the

24:20.240 --> 24:25.680
location he chose to reside in, and the culture being incumbent with that, it's a real shame that the laws

24:25.680 --> 24:32.000
to me seem so harsh on him, because of this marijuana he lost the equivalent of $400,000 of

24:32.000 --> 24:38.320
itinerary. I respect him for being honestly as placid as he is, I'm not sure I would be.

24:38.320 --> 24:42.000
What do they do with the guns? They just hold on to them? Put them in a big vault somewhere?

24:42.000 --> 24:43.360
Probably destroy them.

24:43.360 --> 24:44.880
Oh, that's a shame.

24:44.880 --> 24:46.400
Let's conclude then.

24:46.400 --> 24:51.680
FPS Russia has its success rooted in the origins of that old generation of YouTube where people

24:51.680 --> 24:56.800
embraced the chaos, and as Shao deserved to thrive as a product of that. But what was entertainment

24:56.800 --> 25:01.600
eventually became quite real in a way that few could have anticipated. What followed was a

25:01.600 --> 25:06.400
butterfly effect that destabilized a channel already somewhat fragile in the evolving environment,

25:06.400 --> 25:11.600
and the man at the center of it. The channel's reliance on the character of Dimitri, as iconic

25:11.600 --> 25:16.800
as he is, made the issues he faced concurrent with the ones that the channel faced. It cast a shadow

25:16.800 --> 25:22.240
that everyone struggled to escape, and many refused to forget. It led to the eyes of drama detectives

25:22.240 --> 25:26.640
and law enforcement who lay in wait for whatever opportunity they were yielded, and although you

25:26.640 --> 25:31.200
could argue that Karl could have been more conscious of the risks, he couldn't live the rest of his life

25:31.200 --> 25:36.000
looking over his shoulder, and maybe that's why he doesn't appear to care as much, maybe a burden

25:36.000 --> 25:41.040
of sorts has been lifted. Hopefully sometime in the future, in a different environment, he'll have his

25:41.040 --> 25:47.680
legal restrictions re-evaluated. I genuinely hope so. In a way, I do feel sad that they took so much

25:47.680 --> 25:52.480
away from the channel, because even if you weren't using it anymore, it'd be nice to know it's there,

25:52.480 --> 25:57.920
you know, in case you wanted to do a little special for the fans, and of course the value too.

25:57.920 --> 26:03.120
There must have been some sentimental connection, or he probably would have sold it. It sucked.

26:03.120 --> 26:08.960
Innocence prevailing in other situations, he deserved better, and I hope there is justice in the end,

26:08.960 --> 26:14.400
for everything and everyone discussed today. For the moment, I hope he's happier with where he is now,

26:14.400 --> 26:21.040
and as enshrined as it is, FPS Russia was a product of its time, and one whose time has probably passed.

26:21.040 --> 26:28.640
To those who enjoyed it, well, don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.

26:29.840 --> 26:36.400
You already knew how to shoot this shit. Hope you guys enjoyed the video, and as always, have a nice day.

26:40.400 --> 26:46.320
So that was the video, I hope you enjoyed it, I think I enjoyed it. It was a bit shorter than

26:46.320 --> 26:51.120
normal, but honestly, sometimes we have to moderate the time we spend on these things.

26:51.120 --> 26:56.320
I started another video, and basically that one had some new information that I decided that actually

26:56.320 --> 27:01.600
we should leave that a bit more, let it brew, and we'll act on that later. So I thought we'd do a

27:01.600 --> 27:06.880
little retrospective on something that I do genuinely find quite interesting, and I hope that interest showed.

27:06.880 --> 27:13.520
I wanted to give a big shoutout to my editors, once again, they have done a fantastic job,

27:13.600 --> 27:18.400
I can't really thank them enough, they just do great work time after time, and it's great to know that I can rely on

27:18.400 --> 27:24.000
people to make content that's entertaining for so many people. I also want to give a big shoutout to my

27:24.000 --> 27:31.120
Patreons, current Patreons, at the time of the recording, November of course, is my $10 Patreons up on screen

27:31.120 --> 27:38.480
right now, $50 Patreons, Sumhala Baloo, Nico Deschamps, and Caroline, and my $100 Patreons.

27:38.560 --> 27:45.760
We have a new Patreon, who hopefully, I'm putting my faith into, for the pledge to go through at the end of the month,

27:45.760 --> 27:51.360
Stanton, thank you very much, man, it really makes a difference. I also wanted to give a big thanks to Brandon,

27:51.360 --> 27:57.680
someone who I still don't know who he is, his pledge has now, lifetime pledge has hit $1000, which honestly is

27:57.680 --> 28:03.520
incredible, and I can't thank you enough, man, if you're watching this, love you, I hope you still take

28:03.520 --> 28:07.760
something away from my videos, I hope you haven't spontaneously died or something, that would be terrible.

28:07.760 --> 28:16.080
Also, if you wanna hit me up, Twitter, at The Right Opinion, Discord, and of course, Facebook, though I don't use

28:16.080 --> 28:21.280
that right now, I'm gonna try and get back on it, it's all been a bit messy recently, I need to be a bit more

28:21.280 --> 28:27.360
organised, also my Instagram, which is basically a bit more personal, if you wanna know what I'm up to, what I'm

28:27.360 --> 28:35.360
doing, typically writing, scripting, talking like this, editing, or playing just dance, because you know me,

28:35.360 --> 28:40.160
great dancer, and I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
