0	2960	Have you ever heard of the tale of Icarus?
8240	13600	Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time and electronic arts,
13600	18840	ever the champion for affordable gaming content, with no catch, none at all, no.
18840	24080	They always provide the most in-depth storylines and emotionally resonant characters filled to the brim with content,
24080	31080	an online multiplayer that leaves nothing to the imagination, and DLC that only expands on those fantastical concepts.
31080	34800	That's what I would say if EA had a respectable reputation, but they don't.
34800	40960	EA, as I've known for a long time, as most people here I assume have known for a long time, are a bunch of sneaky twats,
40960	47280	and they have been at it for a while. Over the last few years, anyone with a critical enough eye knew that they were heading in this direction,
47280	49800	so let's give that direction a bit of background.
49800	54520	Microtransactions are a controversial inclusion in a fair few AAA games of recent.
54520	59000	They tend to serve as a way of using additional payments as a gateway to certain in-game content.
59000	63520	Often this might be additional content released at a later date, or it might be stuff that was there from the get-go.
63520	67760	It could be maps, characters, weapons, or just stylistic stuff like clothing or skins.
67760	73880	Microtransactions aren't a particularly new addition to the gaming world, but they certainly have increased in prominence over the last few years.
73880	80280	What we've understood is that they've been increasing in volume and frequency, and have been percolating into the game industry much more recent.
80280	83760	Another popular inclusion in the last few years has been the spin-to-win content.
83760	91080	Though not exactly like the example we'll be using today, a lot of pay-to-win games in the industry like CSGO Lotto have been setting up shop all over the gaming community.
91080	95040	These, admittedly, are more recent additions. They're a bit of a variant on the microtransactions.
95040	100240	They combine the concept of mystery boxes with in-game purchases, and they haven't been spoken about too much,
100240	103600	apart from a few scandals that included gaming advocates such as Syndicate.
103600	109000	Another reflection of loot boxes could be the mystery packs of FIFA games, another EA franchise.
109000	112240	So this brings us to the Electronic Arts gents.
112240	117840	The infamous game developers have certainly been incrementally involved with the addition of microtransactions in their content of recent.
117840	121680	Another development of the recent years was their acquisition of the Star Wars franchise.
121680	126280	They released their first instalment, Star Wars Battlefront, and it was met with mixed reaction from audiences.
126280	130400	Of course, gaming critics love it, because gaming critics love anything that sparkles, basically.
130400	134560	But for people who actually make an investment, it's natural to look at a game a lot more critically.
134560	138800	A lot of people noted the rather restricted content and omission of single-player campaign mode,
138800	141760	which many felt was an important component to the Battlefront series.
141760	147360	I never bought it myself, because I simply felt it wasn't worth the price tag, and I was still pretty involved in GTA V at the time,
147360	149600	and that gave me, infamitely, more substance.
149600	153640	And given the very mixed reviews from people I trusted, I decided to leave it on the shelf.
153640	158800	There was this general feeling of suspicion after the first game, but I think individuals still had a bit of vague optimism.
158800	163560	After all, EA had taken in a lot of criticisms for another one of their games, Titanfall, on board,
163560	168240	and actually turned out an improved sequel that received a lot of praise from people who were critical of the first game.
168240	172520	Could EA take on that ethos and refine Battlefront II to a similar effect?
172520	175320	The answer was a resounding no.
175320	181040	Yes, the beta was released, and there was almost an immediate universal backlash to many of EA's decisions.
181040	184840	The first one was the loot boxes, a truly genius initiative.
184840	189880	They were harpooned by gamers who noted the ridiculous advantages they granted people with the dollar,
189880	196080	and that characters would require days of grinding to attain the equivalent amount of in-game credits to purchase them.
196080	199800	EA did the genuine and honest thing that EA always does.
199800	205520	Firstly, they said they did it to enhance a feeling of pride and achievement, which is a load of bollocks.
205520	210960	And then, after having their response become the most downvoted in Reddit history by a fucking country mile,
210960	214320	they cut the cost by 75% to purchase the heroes.
214320	217920	What they didn't say is they also cut the rate at which you could achieve credits.
217920	221760	After even more backlash, they pooled microtransactions altogether,
221760	226760	but only temporarily, because you can only suspend the dollar. You can never cancel it.
226760	229120	EA knew exactly what they were doing.
229120	235040	They knew that they would force people into a dilemma where they would either have to spend their hard-earned cash or be left behind.
235040	240280	For people who don't want to rack out on the green, they would either have to buy loot boxes with their credits and play the risk game,
240280	244360	or they could preserve the credits and play for a very, very, very long time.
244360	250440	I also like how EA told their investors that the removal of the microtransactions wouldn't influence the money made by the game
250440	252880	after the game took a hit in the stock investments.
252880	256280	If that's the case, why the fuck did you include it in the first place?
256280	259080	It certainly wasn't out of goodwill, I'll tell you that much.
259080	264480	I'm gonna say it to the gamers, if people have a problem, they have to be more active with their withdrawal.
264480	269200	If people held EA to account in the first place, controversy like this may have never happened.
269200	275680	There will always be hardcore Battlefront fans who will purchase shit no matter what EA does, but they're not as abundant as they might seem.
275680	280200	Companies need to be monetarily reminded that you don't want your games turning into corporate shells.
280200	283800	For some reason, people like to bend over and just take it all sometimes.
283800	288120	If you can live without Star Wars Battlefront II and you think it could be better,
288120	293920	and you've been hearing the corroborating opinions between your acquaintances, just don't fucking buy it.
293920	298800	Don't feel insignificant, the internet amplifies these previously unheard voices in new ways.
298800	304120	I'm starting to sound like a socialist firebrand, but you can stand up to these people, we are connected now.
304120	308520	So if something is unsatisfactory, be the change you want to see in it.
308520	315320	I spoke with my wallet many years ago, and if you think they can do better, and they're not even trying, then speak with your wallet too.
315320	320880	It's all they have. They don't make the game for their grandchildren to play, they make it for the green.
320880	326560	I was modestly inspired by the recent movement of the community to hold EA to account for their shameful business practices,
326560	332520	but there's always more work to be done, and it's important to make sure they don't just subtly creep it in again and again and again.
332520	335840	What's happened here is that EA have moved too quickly.
335840	343080	What we can't let them do is let them in seriously sneak it under the radar, because that's what, essentially, they want to do.
343080	347760	But to people who did actually notice it this time, and did tell them to sort their shit out, good work.
347760	353160	And maybe you'll cause EA to make a game in the future that I might be interested in buying. Miracles can happen.
353160	357000	Until that though, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
