1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Have you ever heard of the tale of Icarus?

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,600
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time and electronic arts,

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,840
ever the champion for affordable gaming content, with no catch, none at all, no.

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,080
They always provide the most in-depth storylines and emotionally resonant characters filled to the brim with content,

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,080
an online multiplayer that leaves nothing to the imagination, and DLC that only expands on those fantastical concepts.

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,800
That's what I would say if EA had a respectable reputation, but they don't.

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,960
EA, as I've known for a long time, as most people here I assume have known for a long time, are a bunch of sneaky twats,

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,280
and they have been at it for a while. Over the last few years, anyone with a critical enough eye knew that they were heading in this direction,

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,800
so let's give that direction a bit of background.

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,520
Microtransactions are a controversial inclusion in a fair few AAA games of recent.

11
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,000
They tend to serve as a way of using additional payments as a gateway to certain in-game content.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,520
Often this might be additional content released at a later date, or it might be stuff that was there from the get-go.

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,760
It could be maps, characters, weapons, or just stylistic stuff like clothing or skins.

14
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,880
Microtransactions aren't a particularly new addition to the gaming world, but they certainly have increased in prominence over the last few years.

15
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:20,280
What we've understood is that they've been increasing in volume and frequency, and have been percolating into the game industry much more recent.

16
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,760
Another popular inclusion in the last few years has been the spin-to-win content.

17
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:31,080
Though not exactly like the example we'll be using today, a lot of pay-to-win games in the industry like CSGO Lotto have been setting up shop all over the gaming community.

18
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,040
These, admittedly, are more recent additions. They're a bit of a variant on the microtransactions.

19
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,240
They combine the concept of mystery boxes with in-game purchases, and they haven't been spoken about too much,

20
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,600
apart from a few scandals that included gaming advocates such as Syndicate.

21
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,000
Another reflection of loot boxes could be the mystery packs of FIFA games, another EA franchise.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,240
So this brings us to the Electronic Arts gents.

23
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,840
The infamous game developers have certainly been incrementally involved with the addition of microtransactions in their content of recent.

24
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,680
Another development of the recent years was their acquisition of the Star Wars franchise.

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,280
They released their first instalment, Star Wars Battlefront, and it was met with mixed reaction from audiences.

26
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,400
Of course, gaming critics love it, because gaming critics love anything that sparkles, basically.

27
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,560
But for people who actually make an investment, it's natural to look at a game a lot more critically.

28
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,800
A lot of people noted the rather restricted content and omission of single-player campaign mode,

29
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,760
which many felt was an important component to the Battlefront series.

30
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,360
I never bought it myself, because I simply felt it wasn't worth the price tag, and I was still pretty involved in GTA V at the time,

31
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,600
and that gave me, infamitely, more substance.

32
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,640
And given the very mixed reviews from people I trusted, I decided to leave it on the shelf.

33
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,800
There was this general feeling of suspicion after the first game, but I think individuals still had a bit of vague optimism.

34
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,560
After all, EA had taken in a lot of criticisms for another one of their games, Titanfall, on board,

35
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,240
and actually turned out an improved sequel that received a lot of praise from people who were critical of the first game.

36
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,520
Could EA take on that ethos and refine Battlefront II to a similar effect?

37
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,320
The answer was a resounding no.

38
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:01,040
Yes, the beta was released, and there was almost an immediate universal backlash to many of EA's decisions.

39
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,840
The first one was the loot boxes, a truly genius initiative.

40
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,880
They were harpooned by gamers who noted the ridiculous advantages they granted people with the dollar,

41
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:16,080
and that characters would require days of grinding to attain the equivalent amount of in-game credits to purchase them.

42
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,800
EA did the genuine and honest thing that EA always does.

43
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:25,520
Firstly, they said they did it to enhance a feeling of pride and achievement, which is a load of bollocks.

44
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,960
And then, after having their response become the most downvoted in Reddit history by a fucking country mile,

45
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,320
they cut the cost by 75% to purchase the heroes.

46
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,920
What they didn't say is they also cut the rate at which you could achieve credits.

47
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,760
After even more backlash, they pooled microtransactions altogether,

48
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,760
but only temporarily, because you can only suspend the dollar. You can never cancel it.

49
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,120
EA knew exactly what they were doing.

50
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,040
They knew that they would force people into a dilemma where they would either have to spend their hard-earned cash or be left behind.

51
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,280
For people who don't want to rack out on the green, they would either have to buy loot boxes with their credits and play the risk game,

52
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,360
or they could preserve the credits and play for a very, very, very long time.

53
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:10,440
I also like how EA told their investors that the removal of the microtransactions wouldn't influence the money made by the game

54
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,880
after the game took a hit in the stock investments.

55
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,280
If that's the case, why the fuck did you include it in the first place?

56
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,080
It certainly wasn't out of goodwill, I'll tell you that much.

57
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,480
I'm gonna say it to the gamers, if people have a problem, they have to be more active with their withdrawal.

58
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,200
If people held EA to account in the first place, controversy like this may have never happened.

59
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:35,680
There will always be hardcore Battlefront fans who will purchase shit no matter what EA does, but they're not as abundant as they might seem.

60
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,200
Companies need to be monetarily reminded that you don't want your games turning into corporate shells.

61
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,800
For some reason, people like to bend over and just take it all sometimes.

62
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,120
If you can live without Star Wars Battlefront II and you think it could be better,

63
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,920
and you've been hearing the corroborating opinions between your acquaintances, just don't fucking buy it.

64
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,800
Don't feel insignificant, the internet amplifies these previously unheard voices in new ways.

65
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,120
I'm starting to sound like a socialist firebrand, but you can stand up to these people, we are connected now.

66
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,520
So if something is unsatisfactory, be the change you want to see in it.

67
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:15,320
I spoke with my wallet many years ago, and if you think they can do better, and they're not even trying, then speak with your wallet too.

68
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,880
It's all they have. They don't make the game for their grandchildren to play, they make it for the green.

69
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,560
I was modestly inspired by the recent movement of the community to hold EA to account for their shameful business practices,

70
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,520
but there's always more work to be done, and it's important to make sure they don't just subtly creep it in again and again and again.

71
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,840
What's happened here is that EA have moved too quickly.

72
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:43,080
What we can't let them do is let them in seriously sneak it under the radar, because that's what, essentially, they want to do.

73
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,760
But to people who did actually notice it this time, and did tell them to sort their shit out, good work.

74
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:53,160
And maybe you'll cause EA to make a game in the future that I might be interested in buying. Miracles can happen.

75
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,000
Until that though, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
