Have you ever heard of the tale of Icarus?

00:08.240 --> 00:13.600
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time and electronic arts,

00:13.600 --> 00:18.840
ever the champion for affordable gaming content, with no catch, none at all, no.

00:18.840 --> 00:24.080
They always provide the most in-depth storylines and emotionally resonant characters filled to the brim with content,

00:24.080 --> 00:31.080
an online multiplayer that leaves nothing to the imagination, and DLC that only expands on those fantastical concepts.

00:31.080 --> 00:34.800
That's what I would say if EA had a respectable reputation, but they don't.

00:34.800 --> 00:40.960
EA, as I've known for a long time, as most people here I assume have known for a long time, are a bunch of sneaky twats,

00:40.960 --> 00:47.280
and they have been at it for a while. Over the last few years, anyone with a critical enough eye knew that they were heading in this direction,

00:47.280 --> 00:49.800
so let's give that direction a bit of background.

00:49.800 --> 00:54.520
Microtransactions are a controversial inclusion in a fair few AAA games of recent.

00:54.520 --> 00:59.000
They tend to serve as a way of using additional payments as a gateway to certain in-game content.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.520
Often this might be additional content released at a later date, or it might be stuff that was there from the get-go.

01:03.520 --> 01:07.760
It could be maps, characters, weapons, or just stylistic stuff like clothing or skins.

01:07.760 --> 01:13.880
Microtransactions aren't a particularly new addition to the gaming world, but they certainly have increased in prominence over the last few years.

01:13.880 --> 01:20.280
What we've understood is that they've been increasing in volume and frequency, and have been percolating into the game industry much more recent.

01:20.280 --> 01:23.760
Another popular inclusion in the last few years has been the spin-to-win content.

01:23.760 --> 01:31.080
Though not exactly like the example we'll be using today, a lot of pay-to-win games in the industry like CSGO Lotto have been setting up shop all over the gaming community.

01:31.080 --> 01:35.040
These, admittedly, are more recent additions. They're a bit of a variant on the microtransactions.

01:35.040 --> 01:40.240
They combine the concept of mystery boxes with in-game purchases, and they haven't been spoken about too much,

01:40.240 --> 01:43.600
apart from a few scandals that included gaming advocates such as Syndicate.

01:43.600 --> 01:49.000
Another reflection of loot boxes could be the mystery packs of FIFA games, another EA franchise.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.240
So this brings us to the Electronic Arts gents.

01:52.240 --> 01:57.840
The infamous game developers have certainly been incrementally involved with the addition of microtransactions in their content of recent.

01:57.840 --> 02:01.680
Another development of the recent years was their acquisition of the Star Wars franchise.

02:01.680 --> 02:06.280
They released their first instalment, Star Wars Battlefront, and it was met with mixed reaction from audiences.

02:06.280 --> 02:10.400
Of course, gaming critics love it, because gaming critics love anything that sparkles, basically.

02:10.400 --> 02:14.560
But for people who actually make an investment, it's natural to look at a game a lot more critically.

02:14.560 --> 02:18.800
A lot of people noted the rather restricted content and omission of single-player campaign mode,

02:18.800 --> 02:21.760
which many felt was an important component to the Battlefront series.

02:21.760 --> 02:27.360
I never bought it myself, because I simply felt it wasn't worth the price tag, and I was still pretty involved in GTA V at the time,

02:27.360 --> 02:29.600
and that gave me, infamitely, more substance.

02:29.600 --> 02:33.640
And given the very mixed reviews from people I trusted, I decided to leave it on the shelf.

02:33.640 --> 02:38.800
There was this general feeling of suspicion after the first game, but I think individuals still had a bit of vague optimism.

02:38.800 --> 02:43.560
After all, EA had taken in a lot of criticisms for another one of their games, Titanfall, on board,

02:43.560 --> 02:48.240
and actually turned out an improved sequel that received a lot of praise from people who were critical of the first game.

02:48.240 --> 02:52.520
Could EA take on that ethos and refine Battlefront II to a similar effect?

02:52.520 --> 02:55.320
The answer was a resounding no.

02:55.320 --> 03:01.040
Yes, the beta was released, and there was almost an immediate universal backlash to many of EA's decisions.

03:01.040 --> 03:04.840
The first one was the loot boxes, a truly genius initiative.

03:04.840 --> 03:09.880
They were harpooned by gamers who noted the ridiculous advantages they granted people with the dollar,

03:09.880 --> 03:16.080
and that characters would require days of grinding to attain the equivalent amount of in-game credits to purchase them.

03:16.080 --> 03:19.800
EA did the genuine and honest thing that EA always does.

03:19.800 --> 03:25.520
Firstly, they said they did it to enhance a feeling of pride and achievement, which is a load of bollocks.

03:25.520 --> 03:30.960
And then, after having their response become the most downvoted in Reddit history by a fucking country mile,

03:30.960 --> 03:34.320
they cut the cost by 75% to purchase the heroes.

03:34.320 --> 03:37.920
What they didn't say is they also cut the rate at which you could achieve credits.

03:37.920 --> 03:41.760
After even more backlash, they pooled microtransactions altogether,

03:41.760 --> 03:46.760
but only temporarily, because you can only suspend the dollar. You can never cancel it.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.120
EA knew exactly what they were doing.

03:49.120 --> 03:55.040
They knew that they would force people into a dilemma where they would either have to spend their hard-earned cash or be left behind.

03:55.040 --> 04:00.280
For people who don't want to rack out on the green, they would either have to buy loot boxes with their credits and play the risk game,

04:00.280 --> 04:04.360
or they could preserve the credits and play for a very, very, very long time.

04:04.360 --> 04:10.440
I also like how EA told their investors that the removal of the microtransactions wouldn't influence the money made by the game

04:10.440 --> 04:12.880
after the game took a hit in the stock investments.

04:12.880 --> 04:16.280
If that's the case, why the fuck did you include it in the first place?

04:16.280 --> 04:19.080
It certainly wasn't out of goodwill, I'll tell you that much.

04:19.080 --> 04:24.480
I'm gonna say it to the gamers, if people have a problem, they have to be more active with their withdrawal.

04:24.480 --> 04:29.200
If people held EA to account in the first place, controversy like this may have never happened.

04:29.200 --> 04:35.680
There will always be hardcore Battlefront fans who will purchase shit no matter what EA does, but they're not as abundant as they might seem.

04:35.680 --> 04:40.200
Companies need to be monetarily reminded that you don't want your games turning into corporate shells.

04:40.200 --> 04:43.800
For some reason, people like to bend over and just take it all sometimes.

04:43.800 --> 04:48.120
If you can live without Star Wars Battlefront II and you think it could be better,

04:48.120 --> 04:53.920
and you've been hearing the corroborating opinions between your acquaintances, just don't fucking buy it.

04:53.920 --> 04:58.800
Don't feel insignificant, the internet amplifies these previously unheard voices in new ways.

04:58.800 --> 05:04.120
I'm starting to sound like a socialist firebrand, but you can stand up to these people, we are connected now.

05:04.120 --> 05:08.520
So if something is unsatisfactory, be the change you want to see in it.

05:08.520 --> 05:15.320
I spoke with my wallet many years ago, and if you think they can do better, and they're not even trying, then speak with your wallet too.

05:15.320 --> 05:20.880
It's all they have. They don't make the game for their grandchildren to play, they make it for the green.

05:20.880 --> 05:26.560
I was modestly inspired by the recent movement of the community to hold EA to account for their shameful business practices,

05:26.560 --> 05:32.520
but there's always more work to be done, and it's important to make sure they don't just subtly creep it in again and again and again.

05:32.520 --> 05:35.840
What's happened here is that EA have moved too quickly.

05:35.840 --> 05:43.080
What we can't let them do is let them in seriously sneak it under the radar, because that's what, essentially, they want to do.

05:43.080 --> 05:47.760
But to people who did actually notice it this time, and did tell them to sort their shit out, good work.

05:47.760 --> 05:53.160
And maybe you'll cause EA to make a game in the future that I might be interested in buying. Miracles can happen.

05:53.160 --> 05:57.000
Until that though, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
