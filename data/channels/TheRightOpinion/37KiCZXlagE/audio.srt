00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,720
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,240
too much free time, and every now and then I make a video that's a bit out of left field,

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,120
even for my flexible catalogue of content.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,360
Today is the day in which I definitely take on something more challenging, not because

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,080
it's a hard topic to decipher, though it somewhat is, not because it's even particularly controversial,

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,140
but because I expect it's going to dispute a prevailing narrative which has been accepted

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,060
by many spectators, and also defending people who typically I'd have no interest in defending.

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,860
But here we are, half a year later, and after a fair few controversies, I think it's time

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,140
we have a discussion.

10
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,220
This is Zoella, and this is Alfie Deyes.

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,660
They are a pair of British vloggers, they are partners, and they are both relatively

12
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,660
successful.

13
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,060
Zoella is a lifestyle blogger who focuses on a variety of vlogs, primarily leaning towards

14
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:55,220
more beauty sort of content, makeup tutorials, item recommendation, you know that shit.

15
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,700
Whereas Alfie Deyes, also known as Pointless Vlog Vlog, a name that just rolls off your

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,480
tongue, makes videos on a broader range of topics, covering all sorts of things going

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,160
on in his life, which clearly appeals to some people.

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,940
These guys are proper classic YouTube stars, back from the early 2010s, they've been

19
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:11,940
around for a while.

20
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,820
I'd heard of them, obviously, especially Zoella, she's kinda inescapable.

21
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:21,140
They're smiling and happy, and often they'll do collabs with other people who are smiling

22
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:28,180
and happy and everyone's laughing, joy to the world, isn't everything fantastic?

23
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,860
Why won't he stop smiling?

24
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,060
In case you haven't gathered, I don't like them very much.

25
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,400
Nothing personal of course, but it's no secret to those in my inner circle that I loathe

26
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,400
most vloggers.

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,740
Their saccharine levels of glee seem extremely forced, and I find most of their content so

28
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,420
vapid and meaningless.

29
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:52,100
There is a video of them just fucking around in a swimming pool, it has over 1 million

30
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,100
views.

31
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,580
I mean, I'm not gonna knock the business, but Jesus Christ, imagine spending your day

32
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,500
sitting down watching someone set up a swimming pool.

33
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,580
For me, at least, it just seems like content for other people to live through, and although

34
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,900
I understand it can be cathartic in the short term for an audience, this content always

35
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,860
seems to leave a void for me.

36
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,140
Maybe that's just who I am, but who I am affects how I feel.

37
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,140
However, as much as I would love to rag on them, that's not the topic of today.

38
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,820
I just wanted to get that off my chest, but now my chest, my abdomen, my ribcage, my trachea,

39
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:27,700
my lungs, my bronchi, are completely clear, we are ready to rock and roll.

40
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,740
You see, Zoella and Alfie Deyes are part of the British Vloggers crew, and here in the

41
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:36,060
UK we have a very nice little niche for them, not just in the vlogging community, but in

42
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,460
the commentary community.

43
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,900
It's no secret that the British vlogging scene has kinda died, many people like Thatcher

44
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,000
Joe, Marcus Butler, Ollie White, even the ones we're talking about today are what

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,720
I consider stagnating.

46
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,200
I was going to throw Caspar Lee into that mix too, but since he made a video on the

47
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,520
KSI drama, it seems he might just resurrect himself, but I guess we'll see what happens

48
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,520
on that matter.

49
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,000
And ready to shit on the graves of these people are the commentators, which is something I'd

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,180
normally welcome with open arms, I mean, who doesn't love the chaos of calling people

51
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,040
out for doing shitty things?

52
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,460
And in this instance, the main targets were the titular characters of this little tale,

53
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:16,040
good old Zoe and Alfie here, firstly Zoe for her ill-advised Christmas calendar that

54
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,780
came out at a tasty 50 quid, and secondly Alfie for another little stunt in which he

55
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:28,040
quote lived on one quid in a day, spoiler alert, he doesn't exactly play by the rules.

56
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,280
In these little escapades, it's quite easy to see why people dish down criticism fairly

57
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,340
heavily, there were plenty of embarrassing moments to pick apart, especially when you're

58
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,900
going in with the level of precision that many commentators do, as I've said in previous

59
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,420
videos, people in different communities have never been held to the same standards that

60
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,980
we in commentary expect, so when commentators felt ravenous, the vlogging community was

61
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,260
a fucking buffet.

62
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,200
However, I'm going to pose an interesting question today, is it possible that in spite

63
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,700
of all the legitimate criticisms that can be levelled against these individuals, that

64
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,780
mistakes were made by ourselves?

65
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,020
Admittedly when the first lot of drama transpired against Zoella, I was completely on board

66
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,140
for the ride, obviously I wasn't making videos about it at the time because it wasn't really

67
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,840
my thing, however I lapped it all up because it was entertaining, and there was a feeling

68
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,840
of righteousness.

69
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,380
However, as the months went by, I began to question whether it was all worth the passionate

70
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,260
vitriol invested into the numerous videos, and by the time that this second set of drama

71
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,380
came around, I was convinced that this was all a very neatly orchestrated ruse.

72
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,920
How did it happen though?

73
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,020
Well to be honest, given the level of certainty most people have assumed on these topics,

74
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,700
I'm going to begin by returning to the original situations that have sparked this passionate

75
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,360
run of videos from certain creators, and present a different perspective, and why I believe

76
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,940
they're not necessarily receiving the treatment that they deserve.

77
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:53,380
So I hope you're strapped in, because on The Right Opinion, we go 0-100 real quick.

78
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,940
Let's get into it.

79
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,600
Many calendars are not good value.

80
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,180
I think that's one of the less controversial statements I'll be making in this video,

81
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,620
you're feeling festive so you buy a piece of cardboard with holes in to fuel that sentiment.

82
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,940
Honestly if you want 24 pieces of chocolate, just buy a bloody bag, I don't know why

83
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,780
you'd embed it in all the merriment bollocks.

84
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,180
But hey, that's just me, in case you haven't noticed, I'm not by nature the most gleeful

85
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,560
gent, in fact there are very few things that I like that I'll be talking about in this

86
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,460
video, so if you're here for your daily dose of positivity, you're probably in the

87
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,460
wrong place.

88
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,260
But anyhow, like all content, there are cheaper calendars, and more expensive calendars.

89
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,580
Zoella and her marketing team, probably smelling the moolah from a mile away, thought that

90
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,340
it would be great to design some hot and spicy calendars, you know the one that a Zoella

91
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,440
following would happily shovel down.

92
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,180
So they conjured up this little contraption, it's certainly an interesting piece to say

93
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,480
the least, a little nifty design, 12 days of Christmas, all for the very affordable

94
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,260
price of 50 quid.

95
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:57,020
50 quid, I hear you say, that's extortionate, you know what, it is, and in their reaction

96
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,620
to this, people very quickly jump down to hammer in this narrative, and many of the

97
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,280
audiences follow suit.

98
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,820
And to be honest, it's completely understandable, it was an absolute shitshow, from the passionate

99
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,300
rants from various commentators, to a pseudo-apology that left Zoella fumbling like she was trying

100
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:18,320
to run the 110 meter hurdles in high heels, to Caspelli's awful video on it himself,

101
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,300
to the items that did really lack value for money.

102
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,620
It's understandable why people were fairly pissed off, so why in hindsight do I find

103
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,020
the reaction rather disconcerting?

104
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,300
As commentators, it's natural to try and sensationalise situations, because that's

105
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,420
what makes content entertaining, to make a spirited speech at the end of a video, which

106
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,980
fires up the audience to make them feel like they're part of something greater, it's

107
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:44,700
a natural facet within the genre, and the stars had perfectly aligned to burn Zoella

108
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,100
out of the sky.

109
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,220
Often that reaction can be given a pass, even if it's overblown, because of the notoriety

110
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:55,180
held by the targets of these videos, for example, it becomes incredibly hard to defend Logan

111
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,420
Paul, and even though some criticism of him in the past might be debatable, the sheer

112
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:04,340
enormity of his worst moments makes people hesitant to say anything positive about him.

113
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:09,220
The reason is, commentary will typically hold a greater narrative about a character, and

114
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,540
even if the specific situation is not one that may highlight the worst of a person's

115
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:18,060
disposition, the greater narrative prevails in the end, and it becomes hard to speak in

116
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,660
defence of people who may have a questionable mentality.

117
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,660
To Zoella, she was fresh off the Hello World scandal, another predicament that I will discuss

118
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:32,580
very soon, it seemed high tied to bring her and her dirty, scamming nature down, however

119
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,500
after a few months and another look, I think there's a more logical, albeit less dramatic

120
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,580
explanation for the calendar charade, so let's look at it in a bit more depth.

121
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:48,580
Zoella has been selling beauty related merch since 2014, and judging by her other merch,

122
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,520
this is the first time she's really sold anything of particularly bad value, and in

123
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,220
fact looking at her other products, although they're not dirt cheap, which you wouldn't

124
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,500
expect them to be, they're pretty alright for the stands of branded merchandise.

125
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,980
And at the end of the day, that's what the calendar was, it was merch.

126
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,980
We live in a world where people shell out money for a shirt with the word Supreme on.

127
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,220
One of people's heaviest criticisms of Zoella's calendar was that the individual components

128
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:17,460
were almost always significantly cheaper than it was being sold as separate, unbranded content,

129
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,260
which is the case for everything.

130
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:24,540
A blank t-shirt is gonna cost less than a t-shirt with a design on, designs and branding

131
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,980
are what add the value in many ways.

132
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:31,860
As I said earlier, Christmas calendars are not pragmatic, they are ornamental, particularly

133
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,740
in the sort of section that Zoella was trying to appeal to, there are calendars upwards

134
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,460
of 250 quid, which is crazy to you and I, but that's a norm in some circles.

135
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:45,700
So why did people turn on Zoella so specifically, obviously aside from the fact that she was

136
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,700
a YouTuber.

137
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,740
Well, she placed far too much value on the wrong parts of the calendar.

138
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:55,980
And make no mistake, elements like the exterior are very pleasing, however what was inside

139
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,780
was unsatisfactory, and the reason that it was unsatisfactory was because of the product

140
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,780
she chose.

141
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:06,700
If she'd chosen items that had more appeal in their appearance rather than their utility,

142
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,620
like most of the brands she was competing against, she would have been fine, because

143
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,140
it looks delightful.

144
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:17,140
But unfortunately, choosing things like notepads and confetti, which by nature aren't considered

145
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,180
to be enhanced by their natural design, made it much easier for people to lambast.

146
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:26,020
You see, as human beings, when responding to products, we typically cross-apply various

147
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,020
traits.

148
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,620
It's why we're more likely to purchase organic healthy food like fruit, than organic

149
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,900
unhealthy food like alcohol, because we have assigned a different purpose to the unhealthy

150
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,900
food.

151
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,620
We all want to indulge ourselves, and the idea of something being organic, for example,

152
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,220
partly undermines its hedonistic appeal of that special taste to many humans.

153
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,220
This is the same thing with Zoella's products.

154
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,500
Considering the personalised design on the products, it probably cost more to design

155
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,220
than your typical calendar, however because many of them, like the notepad, don't have

156
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,940
its purpose enhanced by a nice design, that effect is often glanced over.

157
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,460
If she'd just stuck 12 different Zoella posts in there, people probably would have

158
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,620
had less of a problem, even if it was cheaper to make.

159
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,740
So essentially, Zoella slapped her name on the calendar and some utility items, and expected

160
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,980
that to add the value, however all these other businesses had the smart idea to put their

161
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,620
already branded content in there, which was enhanced by their namesake naturally, which

162
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,620
is still in essence the same effect, it's just more subtle, because no one's gonna

163
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,860
go to the production line of the content, and actually find out how much it could cost

164
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,980
without the big fuck off name on the bottle.

165
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,060
The brand elevates the content, whereas there's nothing that makes a Zoella notepad any more

166
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,540
purposeful than a normal notepad.

167
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,380
As with anything, you weren't paying for the practical content, you were meant to

168
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,060
be paying for the brand, however the brand did not have the same effect because it was

169
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,780
undone by its lack of appeal to being enhanced by the brand.

170
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:58,740
Most content like shirts, posters, even perfume are cheap as hell to make, and if she stuck

171
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,900
those in a calendar, no one would have given a shit, so I completely understand the criticism,

172
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,020
but just because I understand it, doesn't mean I agree with it.

173
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,100
Everyone knows I'm a cynic, and I'd love to burn disingenuous vloggers at the stake

174
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,840
more than anyone, but no, the fact that she had nothing to gain by choosing such items

175
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,960
just says to me, it was a bad decision, rather than a malicious one.

176
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,780
The content in Zoella's calendar is not much worse than most Christmas calendars,

177
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:29,420
the only reason it was torn apart was because it was easier to compare base level brands,

178
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,780
apart from the two cookie cutters, that was pretty idiotic.

179
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:37,100
But that's not enough for a video, one of the extremely amusing narratives was that

180
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:41,380
Zoella's Christmas calendar items totalled around 20 quid, because you could buy the

181
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,260
unbranded items on Amazon for approximately that.

182
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:49,260
By that logic, every branded item is overpriced because you could purchase a store brand for

183
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,260
a fraction of that.

184
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,540
Honestly, if anything, the whole Zoella Christmas calendar ordeal should say more about

185
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,980
society's strange justification for pointless branding, and the necessity to only call it

186
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,660
out when dealing with cheap, trivial items that emphasise the price gap that branding

187
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:07,660
creates, despite it having a macro effect across all walks of life, from Beats by Dre

188
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,940
to Yeezys to your favourite YouTuber's t-shirts that have been shipped in from Bangladesh.

189
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,900
However, with the latter examples we would merely roll our eyes and call it business,

190
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,980
many YouTubers would have had us to know that Zoella has emerged the horned wench to steal

191
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,580
your children's piggy bank money.

192
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,740
Now, many may point out that other examples being wrong does not necessarily make it right,

193
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,740
and that is true.

194
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,900
If you halve the price of a calendar and save people a good buck, then more power to you.

195
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,700
But the character attacks the narrative that she is some manipulative person who wants

196
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,580
to exploit her fans is hilariously overblown, and the whole idea that the calendar was some

197
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:46,060
atrocity and a front to the consumer also knows this is well within standards of consumerism.

198
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,580
If you want to criticise the culture that's running rife, then be my guest.

199
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,700
But this is no exception, the only reason that it's treated as an exception is because

200
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,680
of our own fallacious approach to branding, and maybe I'd be a bit more open if there

201
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,320
was a specific YouTube context that makes the situation exceptional, like the differences

202
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,460
between Michael McCrudden and the mainstream media, but I fail to see any context that

203
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,420
sets this issue apart from the mainstream.

204
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,860
Firstly, it's much more similar to just standard merchandising, and secondly, YouTuber

205
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,900
merchandise is just as much a part of the culture as any other YouTuber.

206
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,940
If you're going after Zoella, you have to acknowledge that you're singling her out,

207
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,620
because the culture is rooted in exploitation, and given Zoella's record with merchandise,

208
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,420
I'd say she's one of the less ill-intentioned people.

209
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,100
As said earlier, this also seemed very opportune given the situation with Hello World, an event

210
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,780
in which many British vloggers were meant to be able to meet up with their fans in an

211
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,780
open environment.

212
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:42,580
At the time, many commentators found the YouTubers involved to be culpable, and although it does

213
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,620
appear to be an unprecedented disaster, I have found next to no evidence that Zoella

214
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:52,140
was a beneficiary nor a planner of the event, bar vague claims about YouTubers being involved.

215
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,860
The only criticism levied against her was that she was up on stage for a very short

216
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,100
amount of time, however I find this rather unfair considering she was never registered

217
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,220
to be on the stage, and did it out of courtesy, hopefully the TanaCon saga showed the level

218
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,460
of influence the organisers hold.

219
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:12,380
No pun intended, Zoella seems like your cookie cutter YouTuber, I do not like vloggers that

220
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,580
much, and I think people are coming round to that themselves, but honestly I really

221
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,300
question the necessity to bury her, in spite of her size.

222
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,860
In my boogie video, I warned about the issue of setting the burden of proof to heavily,

223
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,460
equally unnecessarily labelling YouTube as a scammer not only risks unfairly branding

224
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:32,900
people but also imposing steep standards, in certain circumstances those standards can

225
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,300
be imposed fairly, such as those criticising Michael McCrudden, because McCrudden stands

226
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,340
as an exception, but in this one imposing these standards just prevents YouTubers from

227
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:45,740
competing in the environment that exists outside of YouTube, because Zoella is not

228
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,820
an exception in the concept, just the execution.

229
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:54,540
To summarise, Zoella made a bad decision, that exposed a trend commonplace in merchandising,

230
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:00,100
yet everyone criticised the concept of merchandising from it, framing Zoella as the pioneer of

231
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,900
ripping people off through branding, when really the industry was cutthroat and she

232
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,780
was just playing the game, she just wasn't smart enough to win it.

233
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,060
Speaking of not smart enough, let's talk about Alfie Deyes.

234
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,500
I generally like to think that to be relatively popular on this platform, you need to have

235
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:35,020
some level of intelligence, and therefore I do not want to speak ill of Alfie Deyes'

236
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:40,540
cognitive ability, he must have used his intuition to tap into a mass appeal, and more credit

237
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:47,740
to him for that, however, in his videos he rarely comes across as the brain of Britain.

238
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,740
I'm wearing your shoes, is that okay?

239
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,740
I mean...

240
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,740
I can't find my sliders, just so the stones don't hurt.

241
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:01,980
And no, it's not just the accent, though it doesn't do him any favours, I jest but

242
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:05,940
my point stands, he clearly isn't the sharpest knife in the draw.

243
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:11,700
His content, as noted, is the fairly vacuous vlogging content, with Zoella sometimes included,

244
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,580
and he clearly wasn't thinking when he decided to do this surviving on one quid challenge.

245
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:22,140
The video is boring as hell, his small talk is awkward, executed poorly, and with a title

246
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:27,300
that is completely tone deaf, which reinforces my point that he lacks perception.

247
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:32,380
It's a completely confused misfire, and a waste of time providing hardly anything of

248
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,380
service.

249
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,540
However, that's all it did, it was fairly worthless, but nothing offensive.

250
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:42,860
Nonetheless, out of this another narrative came, and one that was, once again, understandable,

251
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,100
but completely distorted of what the real problem was.

252
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,900
You see, Alfie Deyes, in spite of the incredibly stupid clickbait title, was clearly trying

253
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:55,620
to go for something simple, to challenge himself to go the day without spending more than £1

254
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,580
on nourishment, and seeing how it affects his lifestyle.

255
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:03,100
It's an interesting little challenge, and it's a good premise for a video, I will

256
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,260
stand by that.

257
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,960
However, the initial title took it down a different route that forever marred its reputation,

258
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,260
so you might ask, how could a couple words ruin a whole video?

259
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:18,060
Well you see, as people, many of us do have good strong principles, and one of them is

260
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,380
that we should never deride people who are experiencing struggle.

261
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,060
One of the ways to denigrate people who are struggling is to mimic them in a way that

262
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,980
may undermine their tribulations.

263
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,060
Now many people who are in these positions of constant battle will have specific issues

264
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,940
pertaining to that fight.

265
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,540
When you're deprived, obviously one of the greatest issues relating to poverty is the

266
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,800
problem of having to get by on small amounts of money.

267
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,960
So in this instance, it looks like we have Alfie Deyes by the neck.

268
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,140
This logical line-up looks infallible, but there's an escape clause that we often forget

269
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,280
when caught up in the indignation.

270
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,040
Just because someone may conduct an action that can be associated with a certain lifestyle

271
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,620
doesn't mean it's an exclusive association.

272
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,280
For example, someone may challenge themselves to do a video where they don't sleep for

273
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,360
a few nights.

274
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,960
Although fairly pointless to me, it doesn't mean that the person is disparaging insomniac

275
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,940
or homeless people, there is a fairly clear alternative explanation.

276
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:15,860
The idea of spending a small amount in a day is not solely associated with being poor,

277
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,440
you might just challenge yourself to be thrifty for example, maybe you want to save money,

278
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,640
I spent less than 1 quid on some days, it does not mean that I'm lacking in any wealth.

279
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,480
However the key mistake that Alfie Deyes made was the titling, the idea that he was living

280
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,640
on 1 pound, because using such a word makes it hard to provide an alternative explanation.

281
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,820
The only people who really survive on such a small amount in that context are those who

282
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:42,320
live in poverty, and therefore this otherwise harmless video became a fairly insensitive

283
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,400
shot at those who were financially deprived.

284
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,680
But what happened was that this led to the comments that he made in his video being interpreted

285
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,080
in a whole different light, particularly with certain commentators, commentators that I

286
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,480
will address very soon, extracting parts of his video and emphasising these statements,

287
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,760
however if you watched the full video I'd hope you'd see what I kind of interpreted,

288
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,720
that it was just him trying to work around the fact that he had a very small amount of

289
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,800
money to spend on eating as much as possible.

290
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,040
Interpretation is key, and as I've said in my Boogie video, a majority of interpretation

291
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,520
will be down to you the creator, however in situations of outrage interpretation will

292
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,680
be more messy, such as this one.

293
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,360
In this instance, the somewhat justified annoyance over the title spilled into an unjustified

294
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,080
annoyance over the whole video.

295
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,080
For example.

296
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,720
So it's probably going to be a little bit difficult, because I don't know how I'm going

297
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,760
to be able to get quantity of food for under a pound.

298
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,960
Thinking about it, I also didn't even have a protein bar this morning after my workout

299
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,320
or a protein shake, which I normally do every single day as well.

300
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,520
Seeing this without context may say, ah, what's that?

301
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,640
You can't have your protein shake?

302
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,200
Most people who have to survive don't even think about fucking protein shakes, you insensitive

303
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
imbecile.

304
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,080
The video did, without a doubt, show up the luxury of his life, but not in a way that

305
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,880
meant he wanted to compare it to everyone else's.

306
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,240
He just put it into the context that this was the change currently going on.

307
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,800
What else do you want from him at that point?

308
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,120
He was taking people through the motions of his day under the premise that this time,

309
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,920
his spending would be limited to one quid on food and drink.

310
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,800
This is why he went to Waitrose, this is why he spoke about all the little innate things

311
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,080
that he would normally do, that he now can't do due to the expenditure.

312
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,000
For me, it doesn't seem hard to understand that, but soon this point of view emerged

313
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,720
that because a person who literally survives on one pound wouldn't live this way, then

314
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,680
Alfie shouldn't live this way himself.

315
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,560
And once again, I completely concur that the title was stupid, but as soon as he was confronted

316
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,800
with this fact, he changed it and put out an apology to anyone who it was insensitive

317
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
towards.

318
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,640
It was the right thing to do in this situation, yet the criticism persisted, and soon this

319
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,440
narrative was crafted that he was just some rich guy and that because of the comments

320
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,760
that he made, he is just ignorant to what all these other people suffer through, even

321
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,120
though that's not the impression I received at all.

322
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,280
And I wouldn't mind if people mocked this video, it's executed poorly and clumsily,

323
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,460
and there's lots to mock.

324
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,760
But the moral grandstanding that somehow bar the title what he did was unacceptable and

325
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,120
ignorant is bemusing, you can't immediately connect not spending money with just being

326
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,800
poor, just because that's one of the explanations, the only reason the connection was ever made

327
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,800
was because he initially presented it as if he was living or surviving, which is something

328
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,360
he rectified very quickly.

329
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,380
A really good example of someone who just had this huge expectation from such an open

330
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,540
premise is this comment on a video that I'll cover soon.

331
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:28,100
They were disappointed that Alpiedaze's video did not provide meaningful social commentary

332
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,100
about poverty.

333
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,160
He wakes up in a mansion every morning for his videos.

334
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,580
The only content that can ever redo that are the ones that completely change the environment

335
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,540
such as rich life, poor life.

336
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:42,700
Daze never attempted to create a narrative on poverty, everyone else did that themselves,

337
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:47,980
and normally I defend it as a decent interpretation, but I can't help but feel that the reactionary

338
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,380
responses to the title completely overlooked human error.

339
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:54,820
Once you get into the video, it seems quite clear to me what he was trying to do, I mean

340
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,100
hell, in spite of its questionable delivery, he even says it himself.

341
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:03,780
So we've got a bit of an interesting day today, we're gonna, we're gonna try something

342
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:08,500
out that I've never even thought about, I've never even contemplated actually doing

343
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,500
myself.

344
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,060
I don't know why I'm even trying to build this up, because you've already seen the

345
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,900
title of the video so you already know what's happening.

346
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:21,540
Okay, if the table will stop wobbling, my total bill for my food and drink intake is

347
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,540
going to be under £1.

348
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:27,420
Comments like these should have dispelled any links that attempted to be drawn between

349
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:32,380
Alfie Daze and actually living in an impoverished environment, he clearly just wanted to see

350
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:36,140
how spending less money affected his lifestyle, and I've watched it all, and there's no

351
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:40,380
reference to being poor, the only thing to be irked by is the annoying depth he talks

352
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,900
about his rich life, I couldn't give two shits about that.

353
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,980
But as I said at the start, that's like 80% of famous bloggers, each of his comments

354
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,180
are neutral statements about what he can't do, yet so many took them as complaints and

355
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,280
that he was a spoiled, out of touch elitist who doesn't understand the real struggle.

356
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:06,460
He was never presenting it as a struggle though, here's another example.

357
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:11,380
He clearly demonstrates a statement of intent, he notes how he cannot buy large amounts of

358
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,580
food on 1 quid.

359
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:16,820
Now in spite of perhaps lacking a level of intellect, Alfie Daze is not a complete moron,

360
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,900
and I'm sure he knew he would not be able to purchase large quantities of food with

361
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,900
1 quid.

362
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,840
He clearly said this as a simple observation, because Alfie Daze is a bit of a basic person.

363
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,620
However people ignored comments like these that may show the video for what it is, and

364
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:35,020
honed in on ones like the following comment about his protein bar which without context

365
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,900
could be taken as a complaint.

366
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,480
A piece of bad clickbait was rightfully criticised, however people decided to take it further

367
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,880
and further and further, and created this image of Alfie Daze as someone who he is not.

368
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,640
He clearly wasn't trying to do anything else than change his own lifestyle, and throughout

369
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,100
the video he did not directly draw parallels in a derisory fashion, and I do not think

370
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,000
he should be crucified for it.

371
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,180
Simply put, I want people to be able to make videos on spending small amounts of money

372
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,800
with no shame, without being hashtag cancelled.

373
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,880
It's not only fairly harmless, but also could provide some useful advice on saving

374
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,040
money to anyone, regardless of income, people should not criticise the premise.

375
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,060
Even if Alfie Daze's video is not the best example of that.

376
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,800
On top of this, I do want people to be able to talk about their lives, rich or poor, in

377
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,840
spite of my little interest for vloggers, once again they do not need to be crucified

378
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,840
for that.

379
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,440
And to be honest, Alfie Daze probably wouldn't have been either, if it hadn't been for

380
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,960
one very talented man, or should I say one very talented mate.

381
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:38,380
This is JackMate, he is a British commentary YouTuber, he'd been kind of under the radar

382
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:42,580
for a few years until he burst back onto the scene sharper than ever with his video

383
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:47,040
on Zoella's Christmas calendar, in which he gave it a fairly brutal damning review.

384
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,400
He then once again turned fairly sharply on Alfie Daze for his one quid video.

385
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:56,400
Now I'd say JackMate is simultaneously one of my favourite and least favourite commentators,

386
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,680
and everything that makes him good is simultaneously what leads me to my multiple objections with

387
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
him.

388
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:06,380
As commentators go, JackMate is an absolute firebrand, he's sharp, energetic, his editing

389
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,140
is some of the most tonally matched in the game, and on top of that, he has the very

390
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,480
unique ability to actually be funny.

391
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,600
I'm a miserable bellend, and I practically find nothing funny, but I take exception to

392
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,020
some of JackMate's content which does, from time to time, throw a good joke in there.

393
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:25,420
Now as a disclaimer, I've spoken about him once before in my apologising for homophobia

394
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:30,820
video, in which I stated that I felt a video made by him was rather unnecessary and preachy,

395
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:35,380
however otherwise I've had no outspoken qualms with him, and obviously that situation

396
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,540
is completely separate to what we're discussing today.

397
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:44,100
JackMate, at his funniest, is also at his angriest, and sure he can be funny without

398
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,480
it, but the charge of emotion that is powered by anger juxtaposed with the humour often

399
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,020
makes for a more amusing viewing, which is why I assume he loaded his videos on Zola

400
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:58,020
and Alfie Daze with a seething fury, because it does provoke a whirlwind of emotion within

401
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,020
the viewer.

402
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,840
However, to demonstrate this, he has to make the anger feel justified, which can often

403
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:08,080
cause a tone of outrage to be slightly manipulated, so you'll have Jack here acting open minded

404
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,180
for a comedic effect, and then seeing it contradicted by the knowledge of new information that proves

405
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,020
the most cynical outlook.

406
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:19,240
For example, he falsely assumes that Zola's calendar has 25 doors.

407
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,920
Well, I think the question is, why isn't it 60?

408
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:27,440
It's got 25 gifts in there, that means a new gift every single day of the month.

409
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,440
12 doors.

410
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,440
Huh?

411
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,440
12 doors.

412
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,440
It's got 12.

413
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,440
It's got 12 doors.

414
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,320
The offscreen person corrects him to 12.

415
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,280
Shock horror as 12 doors is less than 25.

416
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:42,440
This comedic formula is presented throughout the video, however this point in particular

417
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,840
is one that caught my eye, because it was presented as if 12 doors is not normal for

418
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,380
these sorts of calendars, and Zola has just chopped it in half, he continuously refers

419
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,080
to it as a half calendar.

420
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,840
It's better than your traditional calendar, because it's only got half of the doors for

421
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,100
ten times the price.

422
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:03,720
This implies that Zola has purposely reduced the number of doors to extort money from her

423
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,340
adoring fans, despite the fact that actually in places like Boots, John Lewis, and so on,

424
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:13,440
12 doors is fairly ordinary, though if like me you're not a regular shopper at such chains,

425
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,860
you might not realise that.

426
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:19,800
He also presents the calendar as costing a day's wages, to show how much a person would

427
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
have to give up.

428
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,660
For the low low price of just £50, or just one day's wages for your mum and dad, just

429
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,660
craze that.

430
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:32,260
I'd be fine, but it is repeated as a narrative, despite the fact that it lies on the assumption

431
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:36,540
that a person's parents would be working on minimum wage, well below minimum wage, but

432
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,180
I won't be that picky.

433
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:42,540
Considering that for a majority of childbearing ages, the percentage of those on minimum wage

434
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:47,020
is under 10%, it's a bit of a tall narrative, and then considering that most on minimum

435
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:52,440
wage would even expend money on a Christmas calendar, let alone a Zola one, is very tall.

436
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,580
The calendar is probably for upper middle class chums who have easy money to burn, I'm

437
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:01,820
sure those on minimum wage would be spending it on other things than a 50 quid calendar.

438
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:06,540
Jackmate basically paints the very sympathetic story of the working class veteran who has

439
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,620
done a hard day's labour and went and spent what little money they had left on a Zola

440
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,900
calendar for their daughter, and the look of joy on her little face when she was presented

441
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:19,680
it was undercut from the heartbreak when she opened door one and found a bauble, which

442
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,500
as riveting an image it is, is seldom the case.

443
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:27,100
And you know, I try to avoid being pedantic, though it is kind of who I am, but when you're

444
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,360
trying to make something seem worse than it actually is, you still have to be somewhat

445
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,020
accurate with the premises.

446
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:38,180
One of my pet peeves is when people use exaggerative humour, but exaggerate before applying the

447
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:42,820
humour, and then use the humour as a shield when people rightfully criticise their inaccurate

448
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,820
depiction.

449
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,400
Normally it's the exaggeration which is the source of the misinformation, but what

450
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,840
some sneaky people will do is they'll chuck in some slight misinformation and then base

451
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,600
the exaggeration around it.

452
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,800
A really good example off the top of my head in this instance is Racism Dog, it strikes

453
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,960
the balance of being completely inane with everything it does, and yet people take it

454
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,120
seriously enough to actually value what it's saying, and yet the light-hearted premise

455
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,040
means that if you criticise it, you'll have a load of people saying stop taking it so

456
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,880
seriously, despite the fact that those people are often the ones taking its statements the

457
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,160
most seriously.

458
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,760
People aren't necessarily challenging the delivery, they're challenging the implication.

459
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,860
Now it's fair to say that JackMate's video was not the first response to the topic

460
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:26,900
as he read out in his video, there were plenty of negative reviews upon release, and hopefully

461
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,840
I explain why people took a specific distaste to this calendar earlier.

462
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,360
However, he was the one who fanned the flames, and I don't really blame him for the way

463
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:39,240
he thought, but I do blame him for the delivery, which did follow the same format as described

464
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,240
earlier.

465
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,660
I'll leave a link in the description below so you can see for yourself.

466
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:46,120
There isn't much more to say about the Zoella video, although I do think it's framed very

467
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:51,040
cynically and the constant talk of exploitation is rather tiresome, everyone else can judge

468
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,520
it on their own terms.

469
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:57,320
However, when the Alfie Deyes situation came around, JackMate smelled blunt, and was raring

470
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:02,040
to call him out, I mean even his fans expected him to, after all it's right up his street,

471
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,800
however hopefully I showed earlier beyond the title, it's clear there wasn't much to

472
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,640
call him out for beyond a misunderstanding.

473
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,120
JackMate had also covered Alfie Deyes before on a video called My Opinion on Alfie Deyes,

474
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,160
half of which is fairly solid commentary, though he did seem to run off on a tangent

475
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:22,620
towards the end, and it never quite stabilised, so this situation came around and the algorithm

476
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,240
was obviously going to support such a video on him, however if you make a video, you have

477
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,280
to make a video, and so JackMate did, like his Zoella video on the surface, it was fine,

478
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,320
sharp, funny, fairly to the point, but once you look beyond the humour, certain points

479
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,720
become rather dubious.

480
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,760
A fair proportion of it are the sort of points that we've already discussed, the idea that

481
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,480
he was complaining about a lack of commodities, and was comparing those to the struggles of

482
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,480
others.

483
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,240
I realise I can't even use that, I'm gonna have to use this tap water instead.

484
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,720
So not only can he not use his ice, from his ice making machine, he can't even drink

485
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,720
his purified silver mounted distilled Voss H2O premium water from his fridge, what is

486
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,720
a man to do?

487
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:09,720
He's gotta drink normal water from a tap, like normal people, it's not fair!

488
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,280
Zoella didn't sell calendars for this shit!

489
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,600
Once again, video in the description below if you want to see it for yourself.

490
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,800
However I want to hone in on specific points outside of that narrative, because these ones

491
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,680
are fairly contributory to what he crafted.

492
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,680
For example this.

493
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,120
It's weird because he tweeted the video, that's all he did, just tweeted the video,

494
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,480
that got a lot of backlash, so he removed the tweet, but the video is still up, with

495
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,520
five mid-roll adverts.

496
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:37,360
Now at the time of this video, Daze had replaced the video tweet with a written apology addressing

497
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,080
it that is currently gone, but likely because he made a video apology.

498
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,200
So my initial thoughts were, well maybe Jack placed the video up after Daze deleted his

499
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,820
apology and missed it, but upon research I found by looking at times on people who replied

500
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:53,920
to Daze's initial apology, that it was still up well after the video was posted, so it

501
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,880
seemed Jack wasn't quite looking hard enough when he made the claim which paints Alfie

502
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,320
as someone who's just trying to dodge criticism.

503
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,720
A fairly trivial thing in a way, but if you're going to imply something about someone's

504
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,640
courage or character, then it's important that you do get the facts straight.

505
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,180
There are also a set of comments about how Alfie spends his money on items, such as personal

506
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,180
trainers.

507
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:19,680
Oh sorry, just a quick one, are personal trainers free or lover than a quid?

508
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,680
Or this.

509
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
Bought myself a t-shirt.

510
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:27,080
He's literally just buying everything now, I mean, stuff that's like the least essential

511
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,160
things in all, I thought you were meant to be spending a quid.

512
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,400
Bought myself a game for me and Zoe and my family and friends to play.

513
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
What?

514
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:38,120
In spite of the fact that we already know, and he says, that Alfie Daze was only spending

515
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,860
one quid on food and drink, the shock is clearly just for comedic effect, but once again, omitting

516
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,960
this information is a misframing of Alfie's video, and makes him seem much worse than

517
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,740
the actual video in context demonstrates.

518
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:54,240
To hone in on the narrative that really got under my skin, especially when it was delivered

519
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,240
well was this one.

520
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,300
Has he not realised that thousands of people in this country have no choice but to live

521
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,840
on that money every day, and they hate it?

522
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,840
Do you know what I mean?

523
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,600
They have families to support and they hate it, but he's struttin' about his mansion

524
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,240
like hahaha, he's well fun pretending to be poor.

525
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,800
This sounds all fine and moral when you have a firebrand like Jack made delivering it,

526
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,720
but his logic is this.

527
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,040
Person A commercialises something for fun that Person B does not have the choice to

528
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:25,840
do and detests, therefore Person A should not do it, which is logic that would encompass

529
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,860
a lot of modern challenges.

530
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:32,140
The reason why we don't lambast them is because they provide context that makes us

531
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:37,060
know that they're not mocking those suffering, we understand the context of something like

532
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:40,820
Deadly Twister for example, we're not mocking torture victims.

533
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:45,820
The only context that eluded days was mocking the poor was his original title, that he did

534
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:49,620
change, nothing else in the video reflected that, but by the time he changed this, people

535
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,620
almost needed to create their own reasoning to be angry at this otherwise.

536
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:57,700
Throughout JackMate's video, there's this perpetuated expectation that for some reason,

537
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,740
because he's spending one quid in one day, that he should wholly adopt the lifestyle

538
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:06,140
of an impoverished person, despite the fact that he gave no inclination of doing such

539
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,260
and that should have been evidence that he wasn't trying to do that.

540
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,280
This once again lies on the assumption that if you spend low amounts of money on food

541
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,580
and drink in a day, then you must be poor, which just isn't true, there are plenty

542
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:20,600
of people who spend as little amount of money as possible on said products, and likewise

543
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,860
there are people who are poor who just spend high amounts of money on lifestyle and therefore

544
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,980
have nothing left.

545
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:30,860
Correlation isn't causation, equally it's not the sole explanation, not in this scenario

546
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,860
at least.

547
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:36,860
JackMate is the ultimate commentator, in a way a populist brand of YouTuber pushing this

548
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:41,120
narrative that we have a set of out of touch elite vloggers who are business oriented and

549
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,700
have no idea how the other half live or what they want to see, and to be honest, he might

550
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:50,880
be right to an extent, but the narrative can't be found in every example, particularly in

551
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,820
the ones that we've discussed today.

552
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:57,620
However because there was some level of wrongdoing being committed, it allowed people to create

553
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:02,340
further narratives that went after the characters in question, more than it ever needed to,

554
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:07,940
and justify it because to some extent it does sound logical, but a lot of the points weren't,

555
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:12,580
and although they were well coordinated, they went after these people for the wrong reasons,

556
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,500
and that's something I can simply never endorse.

557
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:20,500
Zoella and Alfie Deyes made some bad decisions, and everyone turned out to stick that nail

558
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:25,680
into the coffin, partly because it's a fruitful topic, also because there's not much audience

559
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,980
crossover but there is a widespread appeal, and because vloggers and commentators have

560
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:34,520
never had quite the best relationship, and when it happened first time round, it may

561
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,940
have felt right, but for me looking back, I can't say I feel the same.

562
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:43,340
I think trying to say as much about their characters as people did was an overreaction,

563
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:47,240
that is coming from someone like me who loves character studies.

564
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,680
Having the strict moral code that many YouTubers seem to adopt in these scenarios to prove

565
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,360
these people wrong, would almost definitely lead to hypocrisy in any other dramatic situation

566
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,320
on YouTube, and in the real world.

567
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:04,120
I know that might not be a popular opinion, but it's my opinion, the right opinion.

568
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,120
Wink wink.

569
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,360
Anyhow, I always love to hear what people think, drop it down in the comments below,

570
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,480
and I will typically read them in the first few hours, and I will read the top comments

571
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,160
on a constant basis.

572
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,580
I also want to give a huge shout out to the editors, go check their content out, go give

573
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:22,680
them a subscription if you have the time, if you can, spare a minute, and go and send

574
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,080
them some love because they deserve it, the channel would not be where it is today without

575
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,080
their dedication.

576
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,180
If you want to contact me about anything specifically, you can reach me on Twitter, at the right

577
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,680
opinion, I'm always around on there, you can reach me on Facebook, I'll leave the link

578
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,280
to that in the pinned comment below, Discord too, I have a Discord server you'll love to

579
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,580
pop by in there, you can even reach me on email, but who the hell uses email?

580
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:48,640
Some people have reached on me on email actually, so there you have it.

581
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,320
But anyhow, I tried to make myself accessible, once again, thanks for all the support of

582
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,000
recent, hopefully this video has done something positive for you at least.

583
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,840
Until then, I'm the right opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
