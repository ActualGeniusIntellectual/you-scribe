Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:08.720 --> 00:13.240
too much free time, and every now and then I make a video that's a bit out of left field,

00:13.240 --> 00:16.120
even for my flexible catalogue of content.

00:16.120 --> 00:19.360
Today is the day in which I definitely take on something more challenging, not because

00:19.360 --> 00:24.080
it's a hard topic to decipher, though it somewhat is, not because it's even particularly controversial,

00:24.080 --> 00:28.140
but because I expect it's going to dispute a prevailing narrative which has been accepted

00:28.140 --> 00:33.060
by many spectators, and also defending people who typically I'd have no interest in defending.

00:33.060 --> 00:36.860
But here we are, half a year later, and after a fair few controversies, I think it's time

00:36.860 --> 00:38.140
we have a discussion.

00:38.140 --> 00:41.220
This is Zoella, and this is Alfie Deyes.

00:41.220 --> 00:44.660
They are a pair of British vloggers, they are partners, and they are both relatively

00:44.660 --> 00:45.660
successful.

00:45.660 --> 00:50.060
Zoella is a lifestyle blogger who focuses on a variety of vlogs, primarily leaning towards

00:50.060 --> 00:55.220
more beauty sort of content, makeup tutorials, item recommendation, you know that shit.

00:55.300 --> 00:59.700
Whereas Alfie Deyes, also known as Pointless Vlog Vlog, a name that just rolls off your

00:59.700 --> 01:03.480
tongue, makes videos on a broader range of topics, covering all sorts of things going

01:03.480 --> 01:06.160
on in his life, which clearly appeals to some people.

01:06.160 --> 01:10.940
These guys are proper classic YouTube stars, back from the early 2010s, they've been

01:10.940 --> 01:11.940
around for a while.

01:11.940 --> 01:15.820
I'd heard of them, obviously, especially Zoella, she's kinda inescapable.

01:15.820 --> 01:21.140
They're smiling and happy, and often they'll do collabs with other people who are smiling

01:21.140 --> 01:28.180
and happy and everyone's laughing, joy to the world, isn't everything fantastic?

01:28.180 --> 01:31.860
Why won't he stop smiling?

01:31.860 --> 01:35.060
In case you haven't gathered, I don't like them very much.

01:35.060 --> 01:39.400
Nothing personal of course, but it's no secret to those in my inner circle that I loathe

01:39.400 --> 01:40.400
most vloggers.

01:40.400 --> 01:45.740
Their saccharine levels of glee seem extremely forced, and I find most of their content so

01:45.740 --> 01:47.420
vapid and meaningless.

01:47.420 --> 01:52.100
There is a video of them just fucking around in a swimming pool, it has over 1 million

01:52.100 --> 01:53.100
views.

01:53.100 --> 01:56.580
I mean, I'm not gonna knock the business, but Jesus Christ, imagine spending your day

01:56.580 --> 01:59.500
sitting down watching someone set up a swimming pool.

01:59.500 --> 02:03.580
For me, at least, it just seems like content for other people to live through, and although

02:03.580 --> 02:07.900
I understand it can be cathartic in the short term for an audience, this content always

02:07.900 --> 02:09.860
seems to leave a void for me.

02:09.860 --> 02:13.140
Maybe that's just who I am, but who I am affects how I feel.

02:13.140 --> 02:17.140
However, as much as I would love to rag on them, that's not the topic of today.

02:17.140 --> 02:21.820
I just wanted to get that off my chest, but now my chest, my abdomen, my ribcage, my trachea,

02:21.820 --> 02:27.700
my lungs, my bronchi, are completely clear, we are ready to rock and roll.

02:27.700 --> 02:31.740
You see, Zoella and Alfie Deyes are part of the British Vloggers crew, and here in the

02:31.740 --> 02:36.060
UK we have a very nice little niche for them, not just in the vlogging community, but in

02:36.060 --> 02:37.460
the commentary community.

02:37.460 --> 02:41.900
It's no secret that the British vlogging scene has kinda died, many people like Thatcher

02:41.900 --> 02:46.000
Joe, Marcus Butler, Ollie White, even the ones we're talking about today are what

02:46.000 --> 02:47.720
I consider stagnating.

02:47.720 --> 02:51.200
I was going to throw Caspar Lee into that mix too, but since he made a video on the

02:51.200 --> 02:55.520
KSI drama, it seems he might just resurrect himself, but I guess we'll see what happens

02:55.520 --> 02:56.520
on that matter.

02:56.520 --> 03:01.000
And ready to shit on the graves of these people are the commentators, which is something I'd

03:01.000 --> 03:05.180
normally welcome with open arms, I mean, who doesn't love the chaos of calling people

03:05.180 --> 03:07.040
out for doing shitty things?

03:07.040 --> 03:11.460
And in this instance, the main targets were the titular characters of this little tale,

03:11.460 --> 03:16.040
good old Zoe and Alfie here, firstly Zoe for her ill-advised Christmas calendar that

03:16.040 --> 03:21.780
came out at a tasty 50 quid, and secondly Alfie for another little stunt in which he

03:21.780 --> 03:28.040
quote lived on one quid in a day, spoiler alert, he doesn't exactly play by the rules.

03:28.040 --> 03:32.280
In these little escapades, it's quite easy to see why people dish down criticism fairly

03:32.280 --> 03:36.340
heavily, there were plenty of embarrassing moments to pick apart, especially when you're

03:36.340 --> 03:40.900
going in with the level of precision that many commentators do, as I've said in previous

03:40.900 --> 03:44.420
videos, people in different communities have never been held to the same standards that

03:44.420 --> 03:48.980
we in commentary expect, so when commentators felt ravenous, the vlogging community was

03:48.980 --> 03:50.260
a fucking buffet.

03:50.260 --> 03:55.200
However, I'm going to pose an interesting question today, is it possible that in spite

03:55.200 --> 03:58.700
of all the legitimate criticisms that can be levelled against these individuals, that

03:58.700 --> 04:00.780
mistakes were made by ourselves?

04:00.780 --> 04:05.020
Admittedly when the first lot of drama transpired against Zoella, I was completely on board

04:05.020 --> 04:09.140
for the ride, obviously I wasn't making videos about it at the time because it wasn't really

04:09.140 --> 04:13.840
my thing, however I lapped it all up because it was entertaining, and there was a feeling

04:13.840 --> 04:14.840
of righteousness.

04:14.840 --> 04:19.380
However, as the months went by, I began to question whether it was all worth the passionate

04:19.380 --> 04:24.260
vitriol invested into the numerous videos, and by the time that this second set of drama

04:24.260 --> 04:29.380
came around, I was convinced that this was all a very neatly orchestrated ruse.

04:29.380 --> 04:30.920
How did it happen though?

04:30.920 --> 04:35.020
Well to be honest, given the level of certainty most people have assumed on these topics,

04:35.020 --> 04:39.700
I'm going to begin by returning to the original situations that have sparked this passionate

04:39.700 --> 04:44.360
run of videos from certain creators, and present a different perspective, and why I believe

04:44.360 --> 04:47.940
they're not necessarily receiving the treatment that they deserve.

04:47.940 --> 04:53.380
So I hope you're strapped in, because on The Right Opinion, we go 0-100 real quick.

04:53.380 --> 04:55.940
Let's get into it.

04:55.940 --> 04:58.600
Many calendars are not good value.

04:58.600 --> 05:02.180
I think that's one of the less controversial statements I'll be making in this video,

05:02.180 --> 05:06.620
you're feeling festive so you buy a piece of cardboard with holes in to fuel that sentiment.

05:06.620 --> 05:10.940
Honestly if you want 24 pieces of chocolate, just buy a bloody bag, I don't know why

05:10.940 --> 05:12.780
you'd embed it in all the merriment bollocks.

05:12.780 --> 05:17.180
But hey, that's just me, in case you haven't noticed, I'm not by nature the most gleeful

05:17.180 --> 05:20.560
gent, in fact there are very few things that I like that I'll be talking about in this

05:20.560 --> 05:24.460
video, so if you're here for your daily dose of positivity, you're probably in the

05:24.460 --> 05:25.460
wrong place.

05:25.460 --> 05:29.260
But anyhow, like all content, there are cheaper calendars, and more expensive calendars.

05:29.260 --> 05:33.580
Zoella and her marketing team, probably smelling the moolah from a mile away, thought that

05:33.580 --> 05:38.340
it would be great to design some hot and spicy calendars, you know the one that a Zoella

05:38.340 --> 05:40.440
following would happily shovel down.

05:40.440 --> 05:44.180
So they conjured up this little contraption, it's certainly an interesting piece to say

05:44.180 --> 05:48.480
the least, a little nifty design, 12 days of Christmas, all for the very affordable

05:48.480 --> 05:50.260
price of 50 quid.

05:50.260 --> 05:57.020
50 quid, I hear you say, that's extortionate, you know what, it is, and in their reaction

05:57.020 --> 06:01.620
to this, people very quickly jump down to hammer in this narrative, and many of the

06:01.620 --> 06:03.280
audiences follow suit.

06:03.280 --> 06:07.820
And to be honest, it's completely understandable, it was an absolute shitshow, from the passionate

06:07.820 --> 06:12.300
rants from various commentators, to a pseudo-apology that left Zoella fumbling like she was trying

06:12.300 --> 06:18.320
to run the 110 meter hurdles in high heels, to Caspelli's awful video on it himself,

06:18.320 --> 06:21.300
to the items that did really lack value for money.

06:21.300 --> 06:25.620
It's understandable why people were fairly pissed off, so why in hindsight do I find

06:25.620 --> 06:28.020
the reaction rather disconcerting?

06:28.020 --> 06:32.300
As commentators, it's natural to try and sensationalise situations, because that's

06:32.300 --> 06:36.420
what makes content entertaining, to make a spirited speech at the end of a video, which

06:36.420 --> 06:39.980
fires up the audience to make them feel like they're part of something greater, it's

06:39.980 --> 06:44.700
a natural facet within the genre, and the stars had perfectly aligned to burn Zoella

06:44.700 --> 06:46.100
out of the sky.

06:46.100 --> 06:50.220
Often that reaction can be given a pass, even if it's overblown, because of the notoriety

06:50.220 --> 06:55.180
held by the targets of these videos, for example, it becomes incredibly hard to defend Logan

06:55.180 --> 06:59.420
Paul, and even though some criticism of him in the past might be debatable, the sheer

06:59.420 --> 07:04.340
enormity of his worst moments makes people hesitant to say anything positive about him.

07:04.340 --> 07:09.220
The reason is, commentary will typically hold a greater narrative about a character, and

07:09.220 --> 07:13.540
even if the specific situation is not one that may highlight the worst of a person's

07:13.540 --> 07:18.060
disposition, the greater narrative prevails in the end, and it becomes hard to speak in

07:18.060 --> 07:21.660
defence of people who may have a questionable mentality.

07:21.660 --> 07:26.660
To Zoella, she was fresh off the Hello World scandal, another predicament that I will discuss

07:26.660 --> 07:32.580
very soon, it seemed high tied to bring her and her dirty, scamming nature down, however

07:32.580 --> 07:37.500
after a few months and another look, I think there's a more logical, albeit less dramatic

07:37.500 --> 07:42.580
explanation for the calendar charade, so let's look at it in a bit more depth.

07:42.580 --> 07:48.580
Zoella has been selling beauty related merch since 2014, and judging by her other merch,

07:48.580 --> 07:52.520
this is the first time she's really sold anything of particularly bad value, and in

07:52.520 --> 07:56.220
fact looking at her other products, although they're not dirt cheap, which you wouldn't

07:56.220 --> 08:00.500
expect them to be, they're pretty alright for the stands of branded merchandise.

08:00.500 --> 08:03.980
And at the end of the day, that's what the calendar was, it was merch.

08:03.980 --> 08:07.980
We live in a world where people shell out money for a shirt with the word Supreme on.

08:07.980 --> 08:12.220
One of people's heaviest criticisms of Zoella's calendar was that the individual components

08:12.220 --> 08:17.460
were almost always significantly cheaper than it was being sold as separate, unbranded content,

08:17.460 --> 08:19.260
which is the case for everything.

08:19.260 --> 08:24.540
A blank t-shirt is gonna cost less than a t-shirt with a design on, designs and branding

08:24.540 --> 08:26.980
are what add the value in many ways.

08:26.980 --> 08:31.860
As I said earlier, Christmas calendars are not pragmatic, they are ornamental, particularly

08:31.860 --> 08:35.740
in the sort of section that Zoella was trying to appeal to, there are calendars upwards

08:35.740 --> 08:40.460
of 250 quid, which is crazy to you and I, but that's a norm in some circles.

08:40.460 --> 08:45.700
So why did people turn on Zoella so specifically, obviously aside from the fact that she was

08:45.700 --> 08:46.700
a YouTuber.

08:46.740 --> 08:50.740
Well, she placed far too much value on the wrong parts of the calendar.

08:50.740 --> 08:55.980
And make no mistake, elements like the exterior are very pleasing, however what was inside

08:55.980 --> 09:00.780
was unsatisfactory, and the reason that it was unsatisfactory was because of the product

09:00.780 --> 09:01.780
she chose.

09:01.780 --> 09:06.700
If she'd chosen items that had more appeal in their appearance rather than their utility,

09:06.700 --> 09:10.620
like most of the brands she was competing against, she would have been fine, because

09:10.620 --> 09:12.140
it looks delightful.

09:12.140 --> 09:17.140
But unfortunately, choosing things like notepads and confetti, which by nature aren't considered

09:17.140 --> 09:21.180
to be enhanced by their natural design, made it much easier for people to lambast.

09:21.180 --> 09:26.020
You see, as human beings, when responding to products, we typically cross-apply various

09:26.020 --> 09:27.020
traits.

09:27.020 --> 09:31.620
It's why we're more likely to purchase organic healthy food like fruit, than organic

09:31.620 --> 09:36.900
unhealthy food like alcohol, because we have assigned a different purpose to the unhealthy

09:36.900 --> 09:37.900
food.

09:37.900 --> 09:42.620
We all want to indulge ourselves, and the idea of something being organic, for example,

09:42.620 --> 09:47.220
partly undermines its hedonistic appeal of that special taste to many humans.

09:47.220 --> 09:50.220
This is the same thing with Zoella's products.

09:50.220 --> 09:54.500
Considering the personalised design on the products, it probably cost more to design

09:54.500 --> 09:59.220
than your typical calendar, however because many of them, like the notepad, don't have

09:59.220 --> 10:03.940
its purpose enhanced by a nice design, that effect is often glanced over.

10:03.940 --> 10:07.460
If she'd just stuck 12 different Zoella posts in there, people probably would have

10:07.460 --> 10:10.620
had less of a problem, even if it was cheaper to make.

10:10.620 --> 10:15.740
So essentially, Zoella slapped her name on the calendar and some utility items, and expected

10:15.740 --> 10:19.980
that to add the value, however all these other businesses had the smart idea to put their

10:19.980 --> 10:24.620
already branded content in there, which was enhanced by their namesake naturally, which

10:24.620 --> 10:28.620
is still in essence the same effect, it's just more subtle, because no one's gonna

10:28.620 --> 10:32.860
go to the production line of the content, and actually find out how much it could cost

10:32.860 --> 10:34.980
without the big fuck off name on the bottle.

10:34.980 --> 10:40.060
The brand elevates the content, whereas there's nothing that makes a Zoella notepad any more

10:40.060 --> 10:42.540
purposeful than a normal notepad.

10:42.540 --> 10:46.380
As with anything, you weren't paying for the practical content, you were meant to

10:46.380 --> 10:50.060
be paying for the brand, however the brand did not have the same effect because it was

10:50.060 --> 10:53.780
undone by its lack of appeal to being enhanced by the brand.

10:53.780 --> 10:58.740
Most content like shirts, posters, even perfume are cheap as hell to make, and if she stuck

10:58.740 --> 11:02.900
those in a calendar, no one would have given a shit, so I completely understand the criticism,

11:02.900 --> 11:07.020
but just because I understand it, doesn't mean I agree with it.

11:07.020 --> 11:11.100
Everyone knows I'm a cynic, and I'd love to burn disingenuous vloggers at the stake

11:11.100 --> 11:15.840
more than anyone, but no, the fact that she had nothing to gain by choosing such items

11:15.840 --> 11:19.960
just says to me, it was a bad decision, rather than a malicious one.

11:19.960 --> 11:24.780
The content in Zoella's calendar is not much worse than most Christmas calendars,

11:24.780 --> 11:29.420
the only reason it was torn apart was because it was easier to compare base level brands,

11:29.420 --> 11:32.780
apart from the two cookie cutters, that was pretty idiotic.

11:32.780 --> 11:37.100
But that's not enough for a video, one of the extremely amusing narratives was that

11:37.100 --> 11:41.380
Zoella's Christmas calendar items totalled around 20 quid, because you could buy the

11:41.380 --> 11:44.260
unbranded items on Amazon for approximately that.

11:44.260 --> 11:49.260
By that logic, every branded item is overpriced because you could purchase a store brand for

11:49.260 --> 11:50.260
a fraction of that.

11:50.260 --> 11:54.540
Honestly, if anything, the whole Zoella Christmas calendar ordeal should say more about

11:54.540 --> 11:58.980
society's strange justification for pointless branding, and the necessity to only call it

11:58.980 --> 12:02.660
out when dealing with cheap, trivial items that emphasise the price gap that branding

12:02.660 --> 12:07.660
creates, despite it having a macro effect across all walks of life, from Beats by Dre

12:07.660 --> 12:11.940
to Yeezys to your favourite YouTuber's t-shirts that have been shipped in from Bangladesh.

12:11.940 --> 12:15.900
However, with the latter examples we would merely roll our eyes and call it business,

12:15.900 --> 12:19.980
many YouTubers would have had us to know that Zoella has emerged the horned wench to steal

12:19.980 --> 12:21.580
your children's piggy bank money.

12:21.620 --> 12:26.740
Now, many may point out that other examples being wrong does not necessarily make it right,

12:26.740 --> 12:27.740
and that is true.

12:27.740 --> 12:31.900
If you halve the price of a calendar and save people a good buck, then more power to you.

12:31.900 --> 12:35.700
But the character attacks the narrative that she is some manipulative person who wants

12:35.700 --> 12:40.580
to exploit her fans is hilariously overblown, and the whole idea that the calendar was some

12:40.580 --> 12:46.060
atrocity and a front to the consumer also knows this is well within standards of consumerism.

12:46.060 --> 12:49.580
If you want to criticise the culture that's running rife, then be my guest.

12:49.580 --> 12:53.700
But this is no exception, the only reason that it's treated as an exception is because

12:53.700 --> 12:57.680
of our own fallacious approach to branding, and maybe I'd be a bit more open if there

12:57.680 --> 13:02.320
was a specific YouTube context that makes the situation exceptional, like the differences

13:02.320 --> 13:06.460
between Michael McCrudden and the mainstream media, but I fail to see any context that

13:06.460 --> 13:08.420
sets this issue apart from the mainstream.

13:08.420 --> 13:12.860
Firstly, it's much more similar to just standard merchandising, and secondly, YouTuber

13:12.860 --> 13:16.900
merchandise is just as much a part of the culture as any other YouTuber.

13:17.020 --> 13:20.940
If you're going after Zoella, you have to acknowledge that you're singling her out,

13:20.940 --> 13:25.620
because the culture is rooted in exploitation, and given Zoella's record with merchandise,

13:25.620 --> 13:28.420
I'd say she's one of the less ill-intentioned people.

13:28.420 --> 13:33.100
As said earlier, this also seemed very opportune given the situation with Hello World, an event

13:33.100 --> 13:36.780
in which many British vloggers were meant to be able to meet up with their fans in an

13:36.780 --> 13:37.780
open environment.

13:37.780 --> 13:42.580
At the time, many commentators found the YouTubers involved to be culpable, and although it does

13:42.580 --> 13:46.620
appear to be an unprecedented disaster, I have found next to no evidence that Zoella

13:46.620 --> 13:52.140
was a beneficiary nor a planner of the event, bar vague claims about YouTubers being involved.

13:52.140 --> 13:55.860
The only criticism levied against her was that she was up on stage for a very short

13:55.860 --> 14:00.100
amount of time, however I find this rather unfair considering she was never registered

14:00.100 --> 14:05.220
to be on the stage, and did it out of courtesy, hopefully the TanaCon saga showed the level

14:05.220 --> 14:07.460
of influence the organisers hold.

14:07.460 --> 14:12.380
No pun intended, Zoella seems like your cookie cutter YouTuber, I do not like vloggers that

14:12.380 --> 14:15.580
much, and I think people are coming round to that themselves, but honestly I really

14:15.620 --> 14:19.300
question the necessity to bury her, in spite of her size.

14:19.300 --> 14:23.860
In my boogie video, I warned about the issue of setting the burden of proof to heavily,

14:23.860 --> 14:28.460
equally unnecessarily labelling YouTube as a scammer not only risks unfairly branding

14:28.460 --> 14:32.900
people but also imposing steep standards, in certain circumstances those standards can

14:32.900 --> 14:37.300
be imposed fairly, such as those criticising Michael McCrudden, because McCrudden stands

14:37.300 --> 14:41.340
as an exception, but in this one imposing these standards just prevents YouTubers from

14:41.340 --> 14:45.740
competing in the environment that exists outside of YouTube, because Zoella is not

14:45.740 --> 14:48.820
an exception in the concept, just the execution.

14:48.820 --> 14:54.540
To summarise, Zoella made a bad decision, that exposed a trend commonplace in merchandising,

14:54.540 --> 15:00.100
yet everyone criticised the concept of merchandising from it, framing Zoella as the pioneer of

15:00.100 --> 15:03.900
ripping people off through branding, when really the industry was cutthroat and she

15:03.900 --> 15:07.780
was just playing the game, she just wasn't smart enough to win it.

15:07.780 --> 15:11.060
Speaking of not smart enough, let's talk about Alfie Deyes.

15:25.060 --> 15:29.500
I generally like to think that to be relatively popular on this platform, you need to have

15:29.500 --> 15:35.020
some level of intelligence, and therefore I do not want to speak ill of Alfie Deyes'

15:36.020 --> 15:40.540
cognitive ability, he must have used his intuition to tap into a mass appeal, and more credit

15:40.540 --> 15:47.740
to him for that, however, in his videos he rarely comes across as the brain of Britain.

15:47.740 --> 15:49.740
I'm wearing your shoes, is that okay?

15:51.740 --> 15:53.740
I mean...

15:53.740 --> 15:56.740
I can't find my sliders, just so the stones don't hurt.

15:56.740 --> 16:01.980
And no, it's not just the accent, though it doesn't do him any favours, I jest but

16:02.020 --> 16:05.940
my point stands, he clearly isn't the sharpest knife in the draw.

16:05.940 --> 16:11.700
His content, as noted, is the fairly vacuous vlogging content, with Zoella sometimes included,

16:11.700 --> 16:16.580
and he clearly wasn't thinking when he decided to do this surviving on one quid challenge.

16:16.580 --> 16:22.140
The video is boring as hell, his small talk is awkward, executed poorly, and with a title

16:22.140 --> 16:27.300
that is completely tone deaf, which reinforces my point that he lacks perception.

16:27.300 --> 16:32.380
It's a completely confused misfire, and a waste of time providing hardly anything of

16:32.380 --> 16:33.380
service.

16:33.380 --> 16:37.540
However, that's all it did, it was fairly worthless, but nothing offensive.

16:37.540 --> 16:42.860
Nonetheless, out of this another narrative came, and one that was, once again, understandable,

16:42.860 --> 16:46.100
but completely distorted of what the real problem was.

16:46.100 --> 16:50.900
You see, Alfie Deyes, in spite of the incredibly stupid clickbait title, was clearly trying

16:50.900 --> 16:55.620
to go for something simple, to challenge himself to go the day without spending more than £1

16:55.620 --> 16:58.580
on nourishment, and seeing how it affects his lifestyle.

16:58.580 --> 17:03.100
It's an interesting little challenge, and it's a good premise for a video, I will

17:03.100 --> 17:04.260
stand by that.

17:04.260 --> 17:08.960
However, the initial title took it down a different route that forever marred its reputation,

17:08.960 --> 17:13.260
so you might ask, how could a couple words ruin a whole video?

17:13.260 --> 17:18.060
Well you see, as people, many of us do have good strong principles, and one of them is

17:18.060 --> 17:21.380
that we should never deride people who are experiencing struggle.

17:21.380 --> 17:25.060
One of the ways to denigrate people who are struggling is to mimic them in a way that

17:25.060 --> 17:26.980
may undermine their tribulations.

17:26.980 --> 17:31.060
Now many people who are in these positions of constant battle will have specific issues

17:31.060 --> 17:32.940
pertaining to that fight.

17:32.940 --> 17:36.540
When you're deprived, obviously one of the greatest issues relating to poverty is the

17:36.540 --> 17:39.800
problem of having to get by on small amounts of money.

17:39.800 --> 17:43.960
So in this instance, it looks like we have Alfie Deyes by the neck.

17:43.960 --> 17:48.140
This logical line-up looks infallible, but there's an escape clause that we often forget

17:48.140 --> 17:50.280
when caught up in the indignation.

17:50.280 --> 17:55.040
Just because someone may conduct an action that can be associated with a certain lifestyle

17:55.040 --> 17:57.620
doesn't mean it's an exclusive association.

17:57.620 --> 18:01.280
For example, someone may challenge themselves to do a video where they don't sleep for

18:01.280 --> 18:02.360
a few nights.

18:02.360 --> 18:06.960
Although fairly pointless to me, it doesn't mean that the person is disparaging insomniac

18:06.960 --> 18:10.940
or homeless people, there is a fairly clear alternative explanation.

18:10.940 --> 18:15.860
The idea of spending a small amount in a day is not solely associated with being poor,

18:15.860 --> 18:19.440
you might just challenge yourself to be thrifty for example, maybe you want to save money,

18:19.440 --> 18:23.640
I spent less than 1 quid on some days, it does not mean that I'm lacking in any wealth.

18:23.640 --> 18:28.480
However the key mistake that Alfie Deyes made was the titling, the idea that he was living

18:28.480 --> 18:33.640
on 1 pound, because using such a word makes it hard to provide an alternative explanation.

18:33.640 --> 18:37.820
The only people who really survive on such a small amount in that context are those who

18:37.820 --> 18:42.320
live in poverty, and therefore this otherwise harmless video became a fairly insensitive

18:42.320 --> 18:44.400
shot at those who were financially deprived.

18:44.720 --> 18:49.680
But what happened was that this led to the comments that he made in his video being interpreted

18:49.680 --> 18:54.080
in a whole different light, particularly with certain commentators, commentators that I

18:54.080 --> 18:58.480
will address very soon, extracting parts of his video and emphasising these statements,

18:58.480 --> 19:02.760
however if you watched the full video I'd hope you'd see what I kind of interpreted,

19:02.760 --> 19:06.720
that it was just him trying to work around the fact that he had a very small amount of

19:06.720 --> 19:09.800
money to spend on eating as much as possible.

19:09.800 --> 19:14.040
Interpretation is key, and as I've said in my Boogie video, a majority of interpretation

19:14.040 --> 19:18.520
will be down to you the creator, however in situations of outrage interpretation will

19:18.520 --> 19:20.680
be more messy, such as this one.

19:20.680 --> 19:25.360
In this instance, the somewhat justified annoyance over the title spilled into an unjustified

19:25.360 --> 19:27.080
annoyance over the whole video.

19:27.080 --> 19:28.080
For example.

19:28.080 --> 19:31.720
So it's probably going to be a little bit difficult, because I don't know how I'm going

19:31.720 --> 19:35.760
to be able to get quantity of food for under a pound.

19:35.760 --> 19:38.960
Thinking about it, I also didn't even have a protein bar this morning after my workout

19:38.960 --> 19:42.320
or a protein shake, which I normally do every single day as well.

19:42.320 --> 19:45.520
Seeing this without context may say, ah, what's that?

19:45.520 --> 19:47.640
You can't have your protein shake?

19:47.640 --> 19:51.200
Most people who have to survive don't even think about fucking protein shakes, you insensitive

19:51.200 --> 19:52.200
imbecile.

19:52.200 --> 19:56.080
The video did, without a doubt, show up the luxury of his life, but not in a way that

19:56.080 --> 19:58.880
meant he wanted to compare it to everyone else's.

19:58.880 --> 20:03.240
He just put it into the context that this was the change currently going on.

20:03.240 --> 20:04.800
What else do you want from him at that point?

20:04.800 --> 20:09.120
He was taking people through the motions of his day under the premise that this time,

20:09.120 --> 20:11.920
his spending would be limited to one quid on food and drink.

20:11.920 --> 20:15.800
This is why he went to Waitrose, this is why he spoke about all the little innate things

20:15.800 --> 20:19.080
that he would normally do, that he now can't do due to the expenditure.

20:19.080 --> 20:23.000
For me, it doesn't seem hard to understand that, but soon this point of view emerged

20:23.000 --> 20:26.720
that because a person who literally survives on one pound wouldn't live this way, then

20:26.720 --> 20:28.680
Alfie shouldn't live this way himself.

20:28.680 --> 20:33.560
And once again, I completely concur that the title was stupid, but as soon as he was confronted

20:33.560 --> 20:37.800
with this fact, he changed it and put out an apology to anyone who it was insensitive

20:37.800 --> 20:38.800
towards.

20:38.800 --> 20:42.640
It was the right thing to do in this situation, yet the criticism persisted, and soon this

20:42.640 --> 20:46.440
narrative was crafted that he was just some rich guy and that because of the comments

20:46.440 --> 20:49.760
that he made, he is just ignorant to what all these other people suffer through, even

20:49.760 --> 20:52.120
though that's not the impression I received at all.

20:52.120 --> 20:56.280
And I wouldn't mind if people mocked this video, it's executed poorly and clumsily,

20:56.280 --> 20:57.460
and there's lots to mock.

20:57.460 --> 21:01.760
But the moral grandstanding that somehow bar the title what he did was unacceptable and

21:01.760 --> 21:06.120
ignorant is bemusing, you can't immediately connect not spending money with just being

21:06.120 --> 21:10.800
poor, just because that's one of the explanations, the only reason the connection was ever made

21:10.800 --> 21:14.800
was because he initially presented it as if he was living or surviving, which is something

21:14.800 --> 21:16.360
he rectified very quickly.

21:16.360 --> 21:20.380
A really good example of someone who just had this huge expectation from such an open

21:20.380 --> 21:23.540
premise is this comment on a video that I'll cover soon.

21:23.540 --> 21:28.100
They were disappointed that Alpiedaze's video did not provide meaningful social commentary

21:28.100 --> 21:29.100
about poverty.

21:29.100 --> 21:32.160
He wakes up in a mansion every morning for his videos.

21:32.160 --> 21:36.580
The only content that can ever redo that are the ones that completely change the environment

21:36.580 --> 21:38.540
such as rich life, poor life.

21:38.540 --> 21:42.700
Daze never attempted to create a narrative on poverty, everyone else did that themselves,

21:42.700 --> 21:47.980
and normally I defend it as a decent interpretation, but I can't help but feel that the reactionary

21:47.980 --> 21:51.380
responses to the title completely overlooked human error.

21:51.380 --> 21:54.820
Once you get into the video, it seems quite clear to me what he was trying to do, I mean

21:54.820 --> 21:58.100
hell, in spite of its questionable delivery, he even says it himself.

21:58.100 --> 22:03.780
So we've got a bit of an interesting day today, we're gonna, we're gonna try something

22:03.780 --> 22:08.500
out that I've never even thought about, I've never even contemplated actually doing

22:08.500 --> 22:09.500
myself.

22:09.500 --> 22:12.060
I don't know why I'm even trying to build this up, because you've already seen the

22:12.060 --> 22:14.900
title of the video so you already know what's happening.

22:14.900 --> 22:21.540
Okay, if the table will stop wobbling, my total bill for my food and drink intake is

22:21.540 --> 22:23.540
going to be under £1.

22:23.540 --> 22:27.420
Comments like these should have dispelled any links that attempted to be drawn between

22:27.420 --> 22:32.380
Alfie Daze and actually living in an impoverished environment, he clearly just wanted to see

22:32.380 --> 22:36.140
how spending less money affected his lifestyle, and I've watched it all, and there's no

22:36.140 --> 22:40.380
reference to being poor, the only thing to be irked by is the annoying depth he talks

22:40.380 --> 22:42.900
about his rich life, I couldn't give two shits about that.

22:42.900 --> 22:46.980
But as I said at the start, that's like 80% of famous bloggers, each of his comments

22:46.980 --> 22:51.180
are neutral statements about what he can't do, yet so many took them as complaints and

22:51.180 --> 22:55.280
that he was a spoiled, out of touch elitist who doesn't understand the real struggle.

22:55.280 --> 23:06.460
He was never presenting it as a struggle though, here's another example.

23:06.460 --> 23:11.380
He clearly demonstrates a statement of intent, he notes how he cannot buy large amounts of

23:11.380 --> 23:12.580
food on 1 quid.

23:12.580 --> 23:16.820
Now in spite of perhaps lacking a level of intellect, Alfie Daze is not a complete moron,

23:16.820 --> 23:20.900
and I'm sure he knew he would not be able to purchase large quantities of food with

23:20.900 --> 23:21.900
1 quid.

23:21.900 --> 23:26.840
He clearly said this as a simple observation, because Alfie Daze is a bit of a basic person.

23:26.840 --> 23:30.620
However people ignored comments like these that may show the video for what it is, and

23:30.620 --> 23:35.020
honed in on ones like the following comment about his protein bar which without context

23:35.020 --> 23:36.900
could be taken as a complaint.

23:36.900 --> 23:41.480
A piece of bad clickbait was rightfully criticised, however people decided to take it further

23:41.480 --> 23:45.880
and further and further, and created this image of Alfie Daze as someone who he is not.

23:45.880 --> 23:49.640
He clearly wasn't trying to do anything else than change his own lifestyle, and throughout

23:49.640 --> 23:54.100
the video he did not directly draw parallels in a derisory fashion, and I do not think

23:54.100 --> 23:56.000
he should be crucified for it.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.180
Simply put, I want people to be able to make videos on spending small amounts of money

24:00.180 --> 24:02.800
with no shame, without being hashtag cancelled.

24:02.800 --> 24:06.880
It's not only fairly harmless, but also could provide some useful advice on saving

24:06.880 --> 24:11.040
money to anyone, regardless of income, people should not criticise the premise.

24:11.040 --> 24:14.060
Even if Alfie Daze's video is not the best example of that.

24:14.060 --> 24:17.800
On top of this, I do want people to be able to talk about their lives, rich or poor, in

24:17.800 --> 24:21.840
spite of my little interest for vloggers, once again they do not need to be crucified

24:21.840 --> 24:22.840
for that.

24:22.840 --> 24:26.440
And to be honest, Alfie Daze probably wouldn't have been either, if it hadn't been for

24:26.440 --> 24:30.960
one very talented man, or should I say one very talented mate.

24:30.960 --> 24:38.380
This is JackMate, he is a British commentary YouTuber, he'd been kind of under the radar

24:38.380 --> 24:42.580
for a few years until he burst back onto the scene sharper than ever with his video

24:42.580 --> 24:47.040
on Zoella's Christmas calendar, in which he gave it a fairly brutal damning review.

24:47.040 --> 24:51.400
He then once again turned fairly sharply on Alfie Daze for his one quid video.

24:51.400 --> 24:56.400
Now I'd say JackMate is simultaneously one of my favourite and least favourite commentators,

24:56.400 --> 25:00.680
and everything that makes him good is simultaneously what leads me to my multiple objections with

25:00.680 --> 25:01.680
him.

25:01.680 --> 25:06.380
As commentators go, JackMate is an absolute firebrand, he's sharp, energetic, his editing

25:06.380 --> 25:10.140
is some of the most tonally matched in the game, and on top of that, he has the very

25:10.140 --> 25:12.480
unique ability to actually be funny.

25:12.480 --> 25:16.600
I'm a miserable bellend, and I practically find nothing funny, but I take exception to

25:16.600 --> 25:21.020
some of JackMate's content which does, from time to time, throw a good joke in there.

25:21.020 --> 25:25.420
Now as a disclaimer, I've spoken about him once before in my apologising for homophobia

25:25.420 --> 25:30.820
video, in which I stated that I felt a video made by him was rather unnecessary and preachy,

25:30.820 --> 25:35.380
however otherwise I've had no outspoken qualms with him, and obviously that situation

25:35.380 --> 25:38.540
is completely separate to what we're discussing today.

25:38.540 --> 25:44.100
JackMate, at his funniest, is also at his angriest, and sure he can be funny without

25:44.100 --> 25:48.480
it, but the charge of emotion that is powered by anger juxtaposed with the humour often

25:48.480 --> 25:53.020
makes for a more amusing viewing, which is why I assume he loaded his videos on Zola

25:53.020 --> 25:58.020
and Alfie Daze with a seething fury, because it does provoke a whirlwind of emotion within

25:58.020 --> 25:59.020
the viewer.

25:59.020 --> 26:02.840
However, to demonstrate this, he has to make the anger feel justified, which can often

26:02.840 --> 26:08.080
cause a tone of outrage to be slightly manipulated, so you'll have Jack here acting open minded

26:08.080 --> 26:13.180
for a comedic effect, and then seeing it contradicted by the knowledge of new information that proves

26:13.180 --> 26:15.020
the most cynical outlook.

26:15.020 --> 26:19.240
For example, he falsely assumes that Zola's calendar has 25 doors.

26:19.240 --> 26:22.920
Well, I think the question is, why isn't it 60?

26:22.920 --> 26:27.440
It's got 25 gifts in there, that means a new gift every single day of the month.

26:27.440 --> 26:28.440
12 doors.

26:28.440 --> 26:29.440
Huh?

26:29.440 --> 26:30.440
12 doors.

26:30.440 --> 26:31.440
It's got 12.

26:31.440 --> 26:32.440
It's got 12 doors.

26:32.440 --> 26:35.320
The offscreen person corrects him to 12.

26:35.320 --> 26:38.280
Shock horror as 12 doors is less than 25.

26:38.280 --> 26:42.440
This comedic formula is presented throughout the video, however this point in particular

26:42.440 --> 26:46.840
is one that caught my eye, because it was presented as if 12 doors is not normal for

26:46.840 --> 26:51.380
these sorts of calendars, and Zola has just chopped it in half, he continuously refers

26:51.380 --> 26:53.080
to it as a half calendar.

26:53.080 --> 26:57.840
It's better than your traditional calendar, because it's only got half of the doors for

26:57.840 --> 26:59.100
ten times the price.

26:59.100 --> 27:03.720
This implies that Zola has purposely reduced the number of doors to extort money from her

27:03.720 --> 27:08.340
adoring fans, despite the fact that actually in places like Boots, John Lewis, and so on,

27:08.340 --> 27:13.440
12 doors is fairly ordinary, though if like me you're not a regular shopper at such chains,

27:13.440 --> 27:14.860
you might not realise that.

27:14.860 --> 27:19.800
He also presents the calendar as costing a day's wages, to show how much a person would

27:19.800 --> 27:20.800
have to give up.

27:20.800 --> 27:25.660
For the low low price of just £50, or just one day's wages for your mum and dad, just

27:25.660 --> 27:26.660
craze that.

27:27.540 --> 27:32.260
I'd be fine, but it is repeated as a narrative, despite the fact that it lies on the assumption

27:32.260 --> 27:36.540
that a person's parents would be working on minimum wage, well below minimum wage, but

27:36.540 --> 27:38.180
I won't be that picky.

27:38.180 --> 27:42.540
Considering that for a majority of childbearing ages, the percentage of those on minimum wage

27:42.540 --> 27:47.020
is under 10%, it's a bit of a tall narrative, and then considering that most on minimum

27:47.020 --> 27:52.440
wage would even expend money on a Christmas calendar, let alone a Zola one, is very tall.

27:52.440 --> 27:56.580
The calendar is probably for upper middle class chums who have easy money to burn, I'm

27:56.580 --> 28:01.820
sure those on minimum wage would be spending it on other things than a 50 quid calendar.

28:01.820 --> 28:06.540
Jackmate basically paints the very sympathetic story of the working class veteran who has

28:06.540 --> 28:10.620
done a hard day's labour and went and spent what little money they had left on a Zola

28:10.620 --> 28:14.900
calendar for their daughter, and the look of joy on her little face when she was presented

28:14.900 --> 28:19.680
it was undercut from the heartbreak when she opened door one and found a bauble, which

28:19.680 --> 28:22.500
as riveting an image it is, is seldom the case.

28:22.540 --> 28:27.100
And you know, I try to avoid being pedantic, though it is kind of who I am, but when you're

28:27.100 --> 28:31.360
trying to make something seem worse than it actually is, you still have to be somewhat

28:31.360 --> 28:33.020
accurate with the premises.

28:33.020 --> 28:38.180
One of my pet peeves is when people use exaggerative humour, but exaggerate before applying the

28:38.180 --> 28:42.820
humour, and then use the humour as a shield when people rightfully criticise their inaccurate

28:42.820 --> 28:43.820
depiction.

28:43.820 --> 28:47.400
Normally it's the exaggeration which is the source of the misinformation, but what

28:47.400 --> 28:51.840
some sneaky people will do is they'll chuck in some slight misinformation and then base

28:51.840 --> 28:53.600
the exaggeration around it.

28:53.600 --> 28:57.800
A really good example off the top of my head in this instance is Racism Dog, it strikes

28:57.800 --> 29:01.960
the balance of being completely inane with everything it does, and yet people take it

29:01.960 --> 29:06.120
seriously enough to actually value what it's saying, and yet the light-hearted premise

29:06.120 --> 29:10.040
means that if you criticise it, you'll have a load of people saying stop taking it so

29:10.040 --> 29:13.880
seriously, despite the fact that those people are often the ones taking its statements the

29:13.880 --> 29:15.160
most seriously.

29:15.160 --> 29:18.760
People aren't necessarily challenging the delivery, they're challenging the implication.

29:18.760 --> 29:22.860
Now it's fair to say that JackMate's video was not the first response to the topic

29:22.860 --> 29:26.900
as he read out in his video, there were plenty of negative reviews upon release, and hopefully

29:26.900 --> 29:30.840
I explain why people took a specific distaste to this calendar earlier.

29:30.840 --> 29:34.360
However, he was the one who fanned the flames, and I don't really blame him for the way

29:34.360 --> 29:39.240
he thought, but I do blame him for the delivery, which did follow the same format as described

29:39.240 --> 29:40.240
earlier.

29:40.240 --> 29:42.660
I'll leave a link in the description below so you can see for yourself.

29:42.660 --> 29:46.120
There isn't much more to say about the Zoella video, although I do think it's framed very

29:46.120 --> 29:51.040
cynically and the constant talk of exploitation is rather tiresome, everyone else can judge

29:51.040 --> 29:52.520
it on their own terms.

29:52.520 --> 29:57.320
However, when the Alfie Deyes situation came around, JackMate smelled blunt, and was raring

29:57.320 --> 30:02.040
to call him out, I mean even his fans expected him to, after all it's right up his street,

30:02.040 --> 30:05.800
however hopefully I showed earlier beyond the title, it's clear there wasn't much to

30:05.800 --> 30:08.640
call him out for beyond a misunderstanding.

30:08.640 --> 30:13.120
JackMate had also covered Alfie Deyes before on a video called My Opinion on Alfie Deyes,

30:13.120 --> 30:17.160
half of which is fairly solid commentary, though he did seem to run off on a tangent

30:17.160 --> 30:22.620
towards the end, and it never quite stabilised, so this situation came around and the algorithm

30:22.620 --> 30:27.240
was obviously going to support such a video on him, however if you make a video, you have

30:27.240 --> 30:32.280
to make a video, and so JackMate did, like his Zoella video on the surface, it was fine,

30:32.280 --> 30:36.320
sharp, funny, fairly to the point, but once you look beyond the humour, certain points

30:36.320 --> 30:37.720
become rather dubious.

30:37.720 --> 30:41.760
A fair proportion of it are the sort of points that we've already discussed, the idea that

30:41.760 --> 30:46.480
he was complaining about a lack of commodities, and was comparing those to the struggles of

30:46.480 --> 30:47.480
others.

30:47.480 --> 30:52.240
I realise I can't even use that, I'm gonna have to use this tap water instead.

30:52.240 --> 30:56.720
So not only can he not use his ice, from his ice making machine, he can't even drink

30:56.720 --> 31:02.720
his purified silver mounted distilled Voss H2O premium water from his fridge, what is

31:02.720 --> 31:03.720
a man to do?

31:03.720 --> 31:09.720
He's gotta drink normal water from a tap, like normal people, it's not fair!

31:09.720 --> 31:12.280
Zoella didn't sell calendars for this shit!

31:12.280 --> 31:15.600
Once again, video in the description below if you want to see it for yourself.

31:15.600 --> 31:19.800
However I want to hone in on specific points outside of that narrative, because these ones

31:19.800 --> 31:22.680
are fairly contributory to what he crafted.

31:22.680 --> 31:23.680
For example this.

31:23.680 --> 31:26.120
It's weird because he tweeted the video, that's all he did, just tweeted the video,

31:26.120 --> 31:30.480
that got a lot of backlash, so he removed the tweet, but the video is still up, with

31:30.480 --> 31:32.520
five mid-roll adverts.

31:32.520 --> 31:37.360
Now at the time of this video, Daze had replaced the video tweet with a written apology addressing

31:37.360 --> 31:41.080
it that is currently gone, but likely because he made a video apology.

31:41.080 --> 31:45.200
So my initial thoughts were, well maybe Jack placed the video up after Daze deleted his

31:45.200 --> 31:49.820
apology and missed it, but upon research I found by looking at times on people who replied

31:49.820 --> 31:53.920
to Daze's initial apology, that it was still up well after the video was posted, so it

31:53.920 --> 31:57.880
seemed Jack wasn't quite looking hard enough when he made the claim which paints Alfie

31:57.880 --> 32:00.320
as someone who's just trying to dodge criticism.

32:00.320 --> 32:04.720
A fairly trivial thing in a way, but if you're going to imply something about someone's

32:04.720 --> 32:08.640
courage or character, then it's important that you do get the facts straight.

32:08.640 --> 32:13.180
There are also a set of comments about how Alfie spends his money on items, such as personal

32:13.180 --> 32:14.180
trainers.

32:14.180 --> 32:19.680
Oh sorry, just a quick one, are personal trainers free or lover than a quid?

32:19.680 --> 32:20.680
Or this.

32:20.680 --> 32:21.680
Bought myself a t-shirt.

32:21.680 --> 32:27.080
He's literally just buying everything now, I mean, stuff that's like the least essential

32:27.080 --> 32:29.160
things in all, I thought you were meant to be spending a quid.

32:29.160 --> 32:32.400
Bought myself a game for me and Zoe and my family and friends to play.

32:32.400 --> 32:33.400
What?

32:33.400 --> 32:38.120
In spite of the fact that we already know, and he says, that Alfie Daze was only spending

32:38.120 --> 32:42.860
one quid on food and drink, the shock is clearly just for comedic effect, but once again, omitting

32:42.860 --> 32:46.960
this information is a misframing of Alfie's video, and makes him seem much worse than

32:46.960 --> 32:49.740
the actual video in context demonstrates.

32:49.740 --> 32:54.240
To hone in on the narrative that really got under my skin, especially when it was delivered

32:54.240 --> 32:55.240
well was this one.

32:55.240 --> 32:59.300
Has he not realised that thousands of people in this country have no choice but to live

32:59.300 --> 33:01.840
on that money every day, and they hate it?

33:01.840 --> 33:02.840
Do you know what I mean?

33:02.840 --> 33:05.600
They have families to support and they hate it, but he's struttin' about his mansion

33:05.600 --> 33:09.240
like hahaha, he's well fun pretending to be poor.

33:09.240 --> 33:13.800
This sounds all fine and moral when you have a firebrand like Jack made delivering it,

33:13.800 --> 33:15.720
but his logic is this.

33:15.720 --> 33:20.040
Person A commercialises something for fun that Person B does not have the choice to

33:20.040 --> 33:25.840
do and detests, therefore Person A should not do it, which is logic that would encompass

33:25.840 --> 33:27.860
a lot of modern challenges.

33:27.860 --> 33:32.140
The reason why we don't lambast them is because they provide context that makes us

33:32.140 --> 33:37.060
know that they're not mocking those suffering, we understand the context of something like

33:37.060 --> 33:40.820
Deadly Twister for example, we're not mocking torture victims.

33:40.820 --> 33:45.820
The only context that eluded days was mocking the poor was his original title, that he did

33:45.820 --> 33:49.620
change, nothing else in the video reflected that, but by the time he changed this, people

33:49.620 --> 33:53.620
almost needed to create their own reasoning to be angry at this otherwise.

33:53.620 --> 33:57.700
Throughout JackMate's video, there's this perpetuated expectation that for some reason,

33:57.700 --> 34:01.740
because he's spending one quid in one day, that he should wholly adopt the lifestyle

34:01.740 --> 34:06.140
of an impoverished person, despite the fact that he gave no inclination of doing such

34:06.140 --> 34:09.260
and that should have been evidence that he wasn't trying to do that.

34:09.260 --> 34:13.280
This once again lies on the assumption that if you spend low amounts of money on food

34:13.280 --> 34:16.580
and drink in a day, then you must be poor, which just isn't true, there are plenty

34:16.580 --> 34:20.600
of people who spend as little amount of money as possible on said products, and likewise

34:20.600 --> 34:24.860
there are people who are poor who just spend high amounts of money on lifestyle and therefore

34:24.860 --> 34:25.980
have nothing left.

34:25.980 --> 34:30.860
Correlation isn't causation, equally it's not the sole explanation, not in this scenario

34:30.860 --> 34:31.860
at least.

34:31.860 --> 34:36.860
JackMate is the ultimate commentator, in a way a populist brand of YouTuber pushing this

34:36.860 --> 34:41.120
narrative that we have a set of out of touch elite vloggers who are business oriented and

34:41.120 --> 34:45.700
have no idea how the other half live or what they want to see, and to be honest, he might

34:45.700 --> 34:50.880
be right to an extent, but the narrative can't be found in every example, particularly in

34:50.880 --> 34:52.820
the ones that we've discussed today.

34:52.820 --> 34:57.620
However because there was some level of wrongdoing being committed, it allowed people to create

34:57.620 --> 35:02.340
further narratives that went after the characters in question, more than it ever needed to,

35:02.340 --> 35:07.940
and justify it because to some extent it does sound logical, but a lot of the points weren't,

35:07.940 --> 35:12.580
and although they were well coordinated, they went after these people for the wrong reasons,

35:12.580 --> 35:15.500
and that's something I can simply never endorse.

35:15.500 --> 35:20.500
Zoella and Alfie Deyes made some bad decisions, and everyone turned out to stick that nail

35:20.500 --> 35:25.680
into the coffin, partly because it's a fruitful topic, also because there's not much audience

35:25.680 --> 35:29.980
crossover but there is a widespread appeal, and because vloggers and commentators have

35:29.980 --> 35:34.520
never had quite the best relationship, and when it happened first time round, it may

35:34.520 --> 35:38.940
have felt right, but for me looking back, I can't say I feel the same.

35:38.940 --> 35:43.340
I think trying to say as much about their characters as people did was an overreaction,

35:43.340 --> 35:47.240
that is coming from someone like me who loves character studies.

35:47.240 --> 35:51.680
Having the strict moral code that many YouTubers seem to adopt in these scenarios to prove

35:51.680 --> 35:56.360
these people wrong, would almost definitely lead to hypocrisy in any other dramatic situation

35:56.360 --> 35:59.320
on YouTube, and in the real world.

35:59.320 --> 36:04.120
I know that might not be a popular opinion, but it's my opinion, the right opinion.

36:04.120 --> 36:05.120
Wink wink.

36:05.120 --> 36:09.360
Anyhow, I always love to hear what people think, drop it down in the comments below,

36:09.360 --> 36:12.480
and I will typically read them in the first few hours, and I will read the top comments

36:12.480 --> 36:14.160
on a constant basis.

36:14.160 --> 36:18.580
I also want to give a huge shout out to the editors, go check their content out, go give

36:18.580 --> 36:22.680
them a subscription if you have the time, if you can, spare a minute, and go and send

36:22.680 --> 36:27.080
them some love because they deserve it, the channel would not be where it is today without

36:27.080 --> 36:28.080
their dedication.

36:28.080 --> 36:32.180
If you want to contact me about anything specifically, you can reach me on Twitter, at the right

36:32.180 --> 36:35.680
opinion, I'm always around on there, you can reach me on Facebook, I'll leave the link

36:35.680 --> 36:40.280
to that in the pinned comment below, Discord too, I have a Discord server you'll love to

36:40.280 --> 36:44.580
pop by in there, you can even reach me on email, but who the hell uses email?

36:44.580 --> 36:48.640
Some people have reached on me on email actually, so there you have it.

36:48.640 --> 36:52.320
But anyhow, I tried to make myself accessible, once again, thanks for all the support of

36:52.320 --> 36:56.000
recent, hopefully this video has done something positive for you at least.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.840
Until then, I'm the right opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
