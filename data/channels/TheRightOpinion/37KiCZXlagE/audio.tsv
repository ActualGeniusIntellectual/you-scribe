0	8720	Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
8720	13240	too much free time, and every now and then I make a video that's a bit out of left field,
13240	16120	even for my flexible catalogue of content.
16120	19360	Today is the day in which I definitely take on something more challenging, not because
19360	24080	it's a hard topic to decipher, though it somewhat is, not because it's even particularly controversial,
24080	28140	but because I expect it's going to dispute a prevailing narrative which has been accepted
28140	33060	by many spectators, and also defending people who typically I'd have no interest in defending.
33060	36860	But here we are, half a year later, and after a fair few controversies, I think it's time
36860	38140	we have a discussion.
38140	41220	This is Zoella, and this is Alfie Deyes.
41220	44660	They are a pair of British vloggers, they are partners, and they are both relatively
44660	45660	successful.
45660	50060	Zoella is a lifestyle blogger who focuses on a variety of vlogs, primarily leaning towards
50060	55220	more beauty sort of content, makeup tutorials, item recommendation, you know that shit.
55300	59700	Whereas Alfie Deyes, also known as Pointless Vlog Vlog, a name that just rolls off your
59700	63480	tongue, makes videos on a broader range of topics, covering all sorts of things going
63480	66160	on in his life, which clearly appeals to some people.
66160	70940	These guys are proper classic YouTube stars, back from the early 2010s, they've been
70940	71940	around for a while.
71940	75820	I'd heard of them, obviously, especially Zoella, she's kinda inescapable.
75820	81140	They're smiling and happy, and often they'll do collabs with other people who are smiling
81140	88180	and happy and everyone's laughing, joy to the world, isn't everything fantastic?
88180	91860	Why won't he stop smiling?
91860	95060	In case you haven't gathered, I don't like them very much.
95060	99400	Nothing personal of course, but it's no secret to those in my inner circle that I loathe
99400	100400	most vloggers.
100400	105740	Their saccharine levels of glee seem extremely forced, and I find most of their content so
105740	107420	vapid and meaningless.
107420	112100	There is a video of them just fucking around in a swimming pool, it has over 1 million
112100	113100	views.
113100	116580	I mean, I'm not gonna knock the business, but Jesus Christ, imagine spending your day
116580	119500	sitting down watching someone set up a swimming pool.
119500	123580	For me, at least, it just seems like content for other people to live through, and although
123580	127900	I understand it can be cathartic in the short term for an audience, this content always
127900	129860	seems to leave a void for me.
129860	133140	Maybe that's just who I am, but who I am affects how I feel.
133140	137140	However, as much as I would love to rag on them, that's not the topic of today.
137140	141820	I just wanted to get that off my chest, but now my chest, my abdomen, my ribcage, my trachea,
141820	147700	my lungs, my bronchi, are completely clear, we are ready to rock and roll.
147700	151740	You see, Zoella and Alfie Deyes are part of the British Vloggers crew, and here in the
151740	156060	UK we have a very nice little niche for them, not just in the vlogging community, but in
156060	157460	the commentary community.
157460	161900	It's no secret that the British vlogging scene has kinda died, many people like Thatcher
161900	166000	Joe, Marcus Butler, Ollie White, even the ones we're talking about today are what
166000	167720	I consider stagnating.
167720	171200	I was going to throw Caspar Lee into that mix too, but since he made a video on the
171200	175520	KSI drama, it seems he might just resurrect himself, but I guess we'll see what happens
175520	176520	on that matter.
176520	181000	And ready to shit on the graves of these people are the commentators, which is something I'd
181000	185180	normally welcome with open arms, I mean, who doesn't love the chaos of calling people
185180	187040	out for doing shitty things?
187040	191460	And in this instance, the main targets were the titular characters of this little tale,
191460	196040	good old Zoe and Alfie here, firstly Zoe for her ill-advised Christmas calendar that
196040	201780	came out at a tasty 50 quid, and secondly Alfie for another little stunt in which he
201780	208040	quote lived on one quid in a day, spoiler alert, he doesn't exactly play by the rules.
208040	212280	In these little escapades, it's quite easy to see why people dish down criticism fairly
212280	216340	heavily, there were plenty of embarrassing moments to pick apart, especially when you're
216340	220900	going in with the level of precision that many commentators do, as I've said in previous
220900	224420	videos, people in different communities have never been held to the same standards that
224420	228980	we in commentary expect, so when commentators felt ravenous, the vlogging community was
228980	230260	a fucking buffet.
230260	235200	However, I'm going to pose an interesting question today, is it possible that in spite
235200	238700	of all the legitimate criticisms that can be levelled against these individuals, that
238700	240780	mistakes were made by ourselves?
240780	245020	Admittedly when the first lot of drama transpired against Zoella, I was completely on board
245020	249140	for the ride, obviously I wasn't making videos about it at the time because it wasn't really
249140	253840	my thing, however I lapped it all up because it was entertaining, and there was a feeling
253840	254840	of righteousness.
254840	259380	However, as the months went by, I began to question whether it was all worth the passionate
259380	264260	vitriol invested into the numerous videos, and by the time that this second set of drama
264260	269380	came around, I was convinced that this was all a very neatly orchestrated ruse.
269380	270920	How did it happen though?
270920	275020	Well to be honest, given the level of certainty most people have assumed on these topics,
275020	279700	I'm going to begin by returning to the original situations that have sparked this passionate
279700	284360	run of videos from certain creators, and present a different perspective, and why I believe
284360	287940	they're not necessarily receiving the treatment that they deserve.
287940	293380	So I hope you're strapped in, because on The Right Opinion, we go 0-100 real quick.
293380	295940	Let's get into it.
295940	298600	Many calendars are not good value.
298600	302180	I think that's one of the less controversial statements I'll be making in this video,
302180	306620	you're feeling festive so you buy a piece of cardboard with holes in to fuel that sentiment.
306620	310940	Honestly if you want 24 pieces of chocolate, just buy a bloody bag, I don't know why
310940	312780	you'd embed it in all the merriment bollocks.
312780	317180	But hey, that's just me, in case you haven't noticed, I'm not by nature the most gleeful
317180	320560	gent, in fact there are very few things that I like that I'll be talking about in this
320560	324460	video, so if you're here for your daily dose of positivity, you're probably in the
324460	325460	wrong place.
325460	329260	But anyhow, like all content, there are cheaper calendars, and more expensive calendars.
329260	333580	Zoella and her marketing team, probably smelling the moolah from a mile away, thought that
333580	338340	it would be great to design some hot and spicy calendars, you know the one that a Zoella
338340	340440	following would happily shovel down.
340440	344180	So they conjured up this little contraption, it's certainly an interesting piece to say
344180	348480	the least, a little nifty design, 12 days of Christmas, all for the very affordable
348480	350260	price of 50 quid.
350260	357020	50 quid, I hear you say, that's extortionate, you know what, it is, and in their reaction
357020	361620	to this, people very quickly jump down to hammer in this narrative, and many of the
361620	363280	audiences follow suit.
363280	367820	And to be honest, it's completely understandable, it was an absolute shitshow, from the passionate
367820	372300	rants from various commentators, to a pseudo-apology that left Zoella fumbling like she was trying
372300	378320	to run the 110 meter hurdles in high heels, to Caspelli's awful video on it himself,
378320	381300	to the items that did really lack value for money.
381300	385620	It's understandable why people were fairly pissed off, so why in hindsight do I find
385620	388020	the reaction rather disconcerting?
388020	392300	As commentators, it's natural to try and sensationalise situations, because that's
392300	396420	what makes content entertaining, to make a spirited speech at the end of a video, which
396420	399980	fires up the audience to make them feel like they're part of something greater, it's
399980	404700	a natural facet within the genre, and the stars had perfectly aligned to burn Zoella
404700	406100	out of the sky.
406100	410220	Often that reaction can be given a pass, even if it's overblown, because of the notoriety
410220	415180	held by the targets of these videos, for example, it becomes incredibly hard to defend Logan
415180	419420	Paul, and even though some criticism of him in the past might be debatable, the sheer
419420	424340	enormity of his worst moments makes people hesitant to say anything positive about him.
424340	429220	The reason is, commentary will typically hold a greater narrative about a character, and
429220	433540	even if the specific situation is not one that may highlight the worst of a person's
433540	438060	disposition, the greater narrative prevails in the end, and it becomes hard to speak in
438060	441660	defence of people who may have a questionable mentality.
441660	446660	To Zoella, she was fresh off the Hello World scandal, another predicament that I will discuss
446660	452580	very soon, it seemed high tied to bring her and her dirty, scamming nature down, however
452580	457500	after a few months and another look, I think there's a more logical, albeit less dramatic
457500	462580	explanation for the calendar charade, so let's look at it in a bit more depth.
462580	468580	Zoella has been selling beauty related merch since 2014, and judging by her other merch,
468580	472520	this is the first time she's really sold anything of particularly bad value, and in
472520	476220	fact looking at her other products, although they're not dirt cheap, which you wouldn't
476220	480500	expect them to be, they're pretty alright for the stands of branded merchandise.
480500	483980	And at the end of the day, that's what the calendar was, it was merch.
483980	487980	We live in a world where people shell out money for a shirt with the word Supreme on.
487980	492220	One of people's heaviest criticisms of Zoella's calendar was that the individual components
492220	497460	were almost always significantly cheaper than it was being sold as separate, unbranded content,
497460	499260	which is the case for everything.
499260	504540	A blank t-shirt is gonna cost less than a t-shirt with a design on, designs and branding
504540	506980	are what add the value in many ways.
506980	511860	As I said earlier, Christmas calendars are not pragmatic, they are ornamental, particularly
511860	515740	in the sort of section that Zoella was trying to appeal to, there are calendars upwards
515740	520460	of 250 quid, which is crazy to you and I, but that's a norm in some circles.
520460	525700	So why did people turn on Zoella so specifically, obviously aside from the fact that she was
525700	526700	a YouTuber.
526740	530740	Well, she placed far too much value on the wrong parts of the calendar.
530740	535980	And make no mistake, elements like the exterior are very pleasing, however what was inside
535980	540780	was unsatisfactory, and the reason that it was unsatisfactory was because of the product
540780	541780	she chose.
541780	546700	If she'd chosen items that had more appeal in their appearance rather than their utility,
546700	550620	like most of the brands she was competing against, she would have been fine, because
550620	552140	it looks delightful.
552140	557140	But unfortunately, choosing things like notepads and confetti, which by nature aren't considered
557140	561180	to be enhanced by their natural design, made it much easier for people to lambast.
561180	566020	You see, as human beings, when responding to products, we typically cross-apply various
566020	567020	traits.
567020	571620	It's why we're more likely to purchase organic healthy food like fruit, than organic
571620	576900	unhealthy food like alcohol, because we have assigned a different purpose to the unhealthy
576900	577900	food.
577900	582620	We all want to indulge ourselves, and the idea of something being organic, for example,
582620	587220	partly undermines its hedonistic appeal of that special taste to many humans.
587220	590220	This is the same thing with Zoella's products.
590220	594500	Considering the personalised design on the products, it probably cost more to design
594500	599220	than your typical calendar, however because many of them, like the notepad, don't have
599220	603940	its purpose enhanced by a nice design, that effect is often glanced over.
603940	607460	If she'd just stuck 12 different Zoella posts in there, people probably would have
607460	610620	had less of a problem, even if it was cheaper to make.
610620	615740	So essentially, Zoella slapped her name on the calendar and some utility items, and expected
615740	619980	that to add the value, however all these other businesses had the smart idea to put their
619980	624620	already branded content in there, which was enhanced by their namesake naturally, which
624620	628620	is still in essence the same effect, it's just more subtle, because no one's gonna
628620	632860	go to the production line of the content, and actually find out how much it could cost
632860	634980	without the big fuck off name on the bottle.
634980	640060	The brand elevates the content, whereas there's nothing that makes a Zoella notepad any more
640060	642540	purposeful than a normal notepad.
642540	646380	As with anything, you weren't paying for the practical content, you were meant to
646380	650060	be paying for the brand, however the brand did not have the same effect because it was
650060	653780	undone by its lack of appeal to being enhanced by the brand.
653780	658740	Most content like shirts, posters, even perfume are cheap as hell to make, and if she stuck
658740	662900	those in a calendar, no one would have given a shit, so I completely understand the criticism,
662900	667020	but just because I understand it, doesn't mean I agree with it.
667020	671100	Everyone knows I'm a cynic, and I'd love to burn disingenuous vloggers at the stake
671100	675840	more than anyone, but no, the fact that she had nothing to gain by choosing such items
675840	679960	just says to me, it was a bad decision, rather than a malicious one.
679960	684780	The content in Zoella's calendar is not much worse than most Christmas calendars,
684780	689420	the only reason it was torn apart was because it was easier to compare base level brands,
689420	692780	apart from the two cookie cutters, that was pretty idiotic.
692780	697100	But that's not enough for a video, one of the extremely amusing narratives was that
697100	701380	Zoella's Christmas calendar items totalled around 20 quid, because you could buy the
701380	704260	unbranded items on Amazon for approximately that.
704260	709260	By that logic, every branded item is overpriced because you could purchase a store brand for
709260	710260	a fraction of that.
710260	714540	Honestly, if anything, the whole Zoella Christmas calendar ordeal should say more about
714540	718980	society's strange justification for pointless branding, and the necessity to only call it
718980	722660	out when dealing with cheap, trivial items that emphasise the price gap that branding
722660	727660	creates, despite it having a macro effect across all walks of life, from Beats by Dre
727660	731940	to Yeezys to your favourite YouTuber's t-shirts that have been shipped in from Bangladesh.
731940	735900	However, with the latter examples we would merely roll our eyes and call it business,
735900	739980	many YouTubers would have had us to know that Zoella has emerged the horned wench to steal
739980	741580	your children's piggy bank money.
741620	746740	Now, many may point out that other examples being wrong does not necessarily make it right,
746740	747740	and that is true.
747740	751900	If you halve the price of a calendar and save people a good buck, then more power to you.
751900	755700	But the character attacks the narrative that she is some manipulative person who wants
755700	760580	to exploit her fans is hilariously overblown, and the whole idea that the calendar was some
760580	766060	atrocity and a front to the consumer also knows this is well within standards of consumerism.
766060	769580	If you want to criticise the culture that's running rife, then be my guest.
769580	773700	But this is no exception, the only reason that it's treated as an exception is because
773700	777680	of our own fallacious approach to branding, and maybe I'd be a bit more open if there
777680	782320	was a specific YouTube context that makes the situation exceptional, like the differences
782320	786460	between Michael McCrudden and the mainstream media, but I fail to see any context that
786460	788420	sets this issue apart from the mainstream.
788420	792860	Firstly, it's much more similar to just standard merchandising, and secondly, YouTuber
792860	796900	merchandise is just as much a part of the culture as any other YouTuber.
797020	800940	If you're going after Zoella, you have to acknowledge that you're singling her out,
800940	805620	because the culture is rooted in exploitation, and given Zoella's record with merchandise,
805620	808420	I'd say she's one of the less ill-intentioned people.
808420	813100	As said earlier, this also seemed very opportune given the situation with Hello World, an event
813100	816780	in which many British vloggers were meant to be able to meet up with their fans in an
816780	817780	open environment.
817780	822580	At the time, many commentators found the YouTubers involved to be culpable, and although it does
822580	826620	appear to be an unprecedented disaster, I have found next to no evidence that Zoella
826620	832140	was a beneficiary nor a planner of the event, bar vague claims about YouTubers being involved.
832140	835860	The only criticism levied against her was that she was up on stage for a very short
835860	840100	amount of time, however I find this rather unfair considering she was never registered
840100	845220	to be on the stage, and did it out of courtesy, hopefully the TanaCon saga showed the level
845220	847460	of influence the organisers hold.
847460	852380	No pun intended, Zoella seems like your cookie cutter YouTuber, I do not like vloggers that
852380	855580	much, and I think people are coming round to that themselves, but honestly I really
855620	859300	question the necessity to bury her, in spite of her size.
859300	863860	In my boogie video, I warned about the issue of setting the burden of proof to heavily,
863860	868460	equally unnecessarily labelling YouTube as a scammer not only risks unfairly branding
868460	872900	people but also imposing steep standards, in certain circumstances those standards can
872900	877300	be imposed fairly, such as those criticising Michael McCrudden, because McCrudden stands
877300	881340	as an exception, but in this one imposing these standards just prevents YouTubers from
881340	885740	competing in the environment that exists outside of YouTube, because Zoella is not
885740	888820	an exception in the concept, just the execution.
888820	894540	To summarise, Zoella made a bad decision, that exposed a trend commonplace in merchandising,
894540	900100	yet everyone criticised the concept of merchandising from it, framing Zoella as the pioneer of
900100	903900	ripping people off through branding, when really the industry was cutthroat and she
903900	907780	was just playing the game, she just wasn't smart enough to win it.
907780	911060	Speaking of not smart enough, let's talk about Alfie Deyes.
925060	929500	I generally like to think that to be relatively popular on this platform, you need to have
929500	935020	some level of intelligence, and therefore I do not want to speak ill of Alfie Deyes'
936020	940540	cognitive ability, he must have used his intuition to tap into a mass appeal, and more credit
940540	947740	to him for that, however, in his videos he rarely comes across as the brain of Britain.
947740	949740	I'm wearing your shoes, is that okay?
951740	953740	I mean...
953740	956740	I can't find my sliders, just so the stones don't hurt.
956740	961980	And no, it's not just the accent, though it doesn't do him any favours, I jest but
962020	965940	my point stands, he clearly isn't the sharpest knife in the draw.
965940	971700	His content, as noted, is the fairly vacuous vlogging content, with Zoella sometimes included,
971700	976580	and he clearly wasn't thinking when he decided to do this surviving on one quid challenge.
976580	982140	The video is boring as hell, his small talk is awkward, executed poorly, and with a title
982140	987300	that is completely tone deaf, which reinforces my point that he lacks perception.
987300	992380	It's a completely confused misfire, and a waste of time providing hardly anything of
992380	993380	service.
993380	997540	However, that's all it did, it was fairly worthless, but nothing offensive.
997540	1002860	Nonetheless, out of this another narrative came, and one that was, once again, understandable,
1002860	1006100	but completely distorted of what the real problem was.
1006100	1010900	You see, Alfie Deyes, in spite of the incredibly stupid clickbait title, was clearly trying
1010900	1015620	to go for something simple, to challenge himself to go the day without spending more than £1
1015620	1018580	on nourishment, and seeing how it affects his lifestyle.
1018580	1023100	It's an interesting little challenge, and it's a good premise for a video, I will
1023100	1024260	stand by that.
1024260	1028960	However, the initial title took it down a different route that forever marred its reputation,
1028960	1033260	so you might ask, how could a couple words ruin a whole video?
1033260	1038060	Well you see, as people, many of us do have good strong principles, and one of them is
1038060	1041380	that we should never deride people who are experiencing struggle.
1041380	1045060	One of the ways to denigrate people who are struggling is to mimic them in a way that
1045060	1046980	may undermine their tribulations.
1046980	1051060	Now many people who are in these positions of constant battle will have specific issues
1051060	1052940	pertaining to that fight.
1052940	1056540	When you're deprived, obviously one of the greatest issues relating to poverty is the
1056540	1059800	problem of having to get by on small amounts of money.
1059800	1063960	So in this instance, it looks like we have Alfie Deyes by the neck.
1063960	1068140	This logical line-up looks infallible, but there's an escape clause that we often forget
1068140	1070280	when caught up in the indignation.
1070280	1075040	Just because someone may conduct an action that can be associated with a certain lifestyle
1075040	1077620	doesn't mean it's an exclusive association.
1077620	1081280	For example, someone may challenge themselves to do a video where they don't sleep for
1081280	1082360	a few nights.
1082360	1086960	Although fairly pointless to me, it doesn't mean that the person is disparaging insomniac
1086960	1090940	or homeless people, there is a fairly clear alternative explanation.
1090940	1095860	The idea of spending a small amount in a day is not solely associated with being poor,
1095860	1099440	you might just challenge yourself to be thrifty for example, maybe you want to save money,
1099440	1103640	I spent less than 1 quid on some days, it does not mean that I'm lacking in any wealth.
1103640	1108480	However the key mistake that Alfie Deyes made was the titling, the idea that he was living
1108480	1113640	on 1 pound, because using such a word makes it hard to provide an alternative explanation.
1113640	1117820	The only people who really survive on such a small amount in that context are those who
1117820	1122320	live in poverty, and therefore this otherwise harmless video became a fairly insensitive
1122320	1124400	shot at those who were financially deprived.
1124720	1129680	But what happened was that this led to the comments that he made in his video being interpreted
1129680	1134080	in a whole different light, particularly with certain commentators, commentators that I
1134080	1138480	will address very soon, extracting parts of his video and emphasising these statements,
1138480	1142760	however if you watched the full video I'd hope you'd see what I kind of interpreted,
1142760	1146720	that it was just him trying to work around the fact that he had a very small amount of
1146720	1149800	money to spend on eating as much as possible.
1149800	1154040	Interpretation is key, and as I've said in my Boogie video, a majority of interpretation
1154040	1158520	will be down to you the creator, however in situations of outrage interpretation will
1158520	1160680	be more messy, such as this one.
1160680	1165360	In this instance, the somewhat justified annoyance over the title spilled into an unjustified
1165360	1167080	annoyance over the whole video.
1167080	1168080	For example.
1168080	1171720	So it's probably going to be a little bit difficult, because I don't know how I'm going
1171720	1175760	to be able to get quantity of food for under a pound.
1175760	1178960	Thinking about it, I also didn't even have a protein bar this morning after my workout
1178960	1182320	or a protein shake, which I normally do every single day as well.
1182320	1185520	Seeing this without context may say, ah, what's that?
1185520	1187640	You can't have your protein shake?
1187640	1191200	Most people who have to survive don't even think about fucking protein shakes, you insensitive
1191200	1192200	imbecile.
1192200	1196080	The video did, without a doubt, show up the luxury of his life, but not in a way that
1196080	1198880	meant he wanted to compare it to everyone else's.
1198880	1203240	He just put it into the context that this was the change currently going on.
1203240	1204800	What else do you want from him at that point?
1204800	1209120	He was taking people through the motions of his day under the premise that this time,
1209120	1211920	his spending would be limited to one quid on food and drink.
1211920	1215800	This is why he went to Waitrose, this is why he spoke about all the little innate things
1215800	1219080	that he would normally do, that he now can't do due to the expenditure.
1219080	1223000	For me, it doesn't seem hard to understand that, but soon this point of view emerged
1223000	1226720	that because a person who literally survives on one pound wouldn't live this way, then
1226720	1228680	Alfie shouldn't live this way himself.
1228680	1233560	And once again, I completely concur that the title was stupid, but as soon as he was confronted
1233560	1237800	with this fact, he changed it and put out an apology to anyone who it was insensitive
1237800	1238800	towards.
1238800	1242640	It was the right thing to do in this situation, yet the criticism persisted, and soon this
1242640	1246440	narrative was crafted that he was just some rich guy and that because of the comments
1246440	1249760	that he made, he is just ignorant to what all these other people suffer through, even
1249760	1252120	though that's not the impression I received at all.
1252120	1256280	And I wouldn't mind if people mocked this video, it's executed poorly and clumsily,
1256280	1257460	and there's lots to mock.
1257460	1261760	But the moral grandstanding that somehow bar the title what he did was unacceptable and
1261760	1266120	ignorant is bemusing, you can't immediately connect not spending money with just being
1266120	1270800	poor, just because that's one of the explanations, the only reason the connection was ever made
1270800	1274800	was because he initially presented it as if he was living or surviving, which is something
1274800	1276360	he rectified very quickly.
1276360	1280380	A really good example of someone who just had this huge expectation from such an open
1280380	1283540	premise is this comment on a video that I'll cover soon.
1283540	1288100	They were disappointed that Alpiedaze's video did not provide meaningful social commentary
1288100	1289100	about poverty.
1289100	1292160	He wakes up in a mansion every morning for his videos.
1292160	1296580	The only content that can ever redo that are the ones that completely change the environment
1296580	1298540	such as rich life, poor life.
1298540	1302700	Daze never attempted to create a narrative on poverty, everyone else did that themselves,
1302700	1307980	and normally I defend it as a decent interpretation, but I can't help but feel that the reactionary
1307980	1311380	responses to the title completely overlooked human error.
1311380	1314820	Once you get into the video, it seems quite clear to me what he was trying to do, I mean
1314820	1318100	hell, in spite of its questionable delivery, he even says it himself.
1318100	1323780	So we've got a bit of an interesting day today, we're gonna, we're gonna try something
1323780	1328500	out that I've never even thought about, I've never even contemplated actually doing
1328500	1329500	myself.
1329500	1332060	I don't know why I'm even trying to build this up, because you've already seen the
1332060	1334900	title of the video so you already know what's happening.
1334900	1341540	Okay, if the table will stop wobbling, my total bill for my food and drink intake is
1341540	1343540	going to be under £1.
1343540	1347420	Comments like these should have dispelled any links that attempted to be drawn between
1347420	1352380	Alfie Daze and actually living in an impoverished environment, he clearly just wanted to see
1352380	1356140	how spending less money affected his lifestyle, and I've watched it all, and there's no
1356140	1360380	reference to being poor, the only thing to be irked by is the annoying depth he talks
1360380	1362900	about his rich life, I couldn't give two shits about that.
1362900	1366980	But as I said at the start, that's like 80% of famous bloggers, each of his comments
1366980	1371180	are neutral statements about what he can't do, yet so many took them as complaints and
1371180	1375280	that he was a spoiled, out of touch elitist who doesn't understand the real struggle.
1375280	1386460	He was never presenting it as a struggle though, here's another example.
1386460	1391380	He clearly demonstrates a statement of intent, he notes how he cannot buy large amounts of
1391380	1392580	food on 1 quid.
1392580	1396820	Now in spite of perhaps lacking a level of intellect, Alfie Daze is not a complete moron,
1396820	1400900	and I'm sure he knew he would not be able to purchase large quantities of food with
1400900	1401900	1 quid.
1401900	1406840	He clearly said this as a simple observation, because Alfie Daze is a bit of a basic person.
1406840	1410620	However people ignored comments like these that may show the video for what it is, and
1410620	1415020	honed in on ones like the following comment about his protein bar which without context
1415020	1416900	could be taken as a complaint.
1416900	1421480	A piece of bad clickbait was rightfully criticised, however people decided to take it further
1421480	1425880	and further and further, and created this image of Alfie Daze as someone who he is not.
1425880	1429640	He clearly wasn't trying to do anything else than change his own lifestyle, and throughout
1429640	1434100	the video he did not directly draw parallels in a derisory fashion, and I do not think
1434100	1436000	he should be crucified for it.
1436000	1440180	Simply put, I want people to be able to make videos on spending small amounts of money
1440180	1442800	with no shame, without being hashtag cancelled.
1442800	1446880	It's not only fairly harmless, but also could provide some useful advice on saving
1446880	1451040	money to anyone, regardless of income, people should not criticise the premise.
1451040	1454060	Even if Alfie Daze's video is not the best example of that.
1454060	1457800	On top of this, I do want people to be able to talk about their lives, rich or poor, in
1457800	1461840	spite of my little interest for vloggers, once again they do not need to be crucified
1461840	1462840	for that.
1462840	1466440	And to be honest, Alfie Daze probably wouldn't have been either, if it hadn't been for
1466440	1470960	one very talented man, or should I say one very talented mate.
1470960	1478380	This is JackMate, he is a British commentary YouTuber, he'd been kind of under the radar
1478380	1482580	for a few years until he burst back onto the scene sharper than ever with his video
1482580	1487040	on Zoella's Christmas calendar, in which he gave it a fairly brutal damning review.
1487040	1491400	He then once again turned fairly sharply on Alfie Daze for his one quid video.
1491400	1496400	Now I'd say JackMate is simultaneously one of my favourite and least favourite commentators,
1496400	1500680	and everything that makes him good is simultaneously what leads me to my multiple objections with
1500680	1501680	him.
1501680	1506380	As commentators go, JackMate is an absolute firebrand, he's sharp, energetic, his editing
1506380	1510140	is some of the most tonally matched in the game, and on top of that, he has the very
1510140	1512480	unique ability to actually be funny.
1512480	1516600	I'm a miserable bellend, and I practically find nothing funny, but I take exception to
1516600	1521020	some of JackMate's content which does, from time to time, throw a good joke in there.
1521020	1525420	Now as a disclaimer, I've spoken about him once before in my apologising for homophobia
1525420	1530820	video, in which I stated that I felt a video made by him was rather unnecessary and preachy,
1530820	1535380	however otherwise I've had no outspoken qualms with him, and obviously that situation
1535380	1538540	is completely separate to what we're discussing today.
1538540	1544100	JackMate, at his funniest, is also at his angriest, and sure he can be funny without
1544100	1548480	it, but the charge of emotion that is powered by anger juxtaposed with the humour often
1548480	1553020	makes for a more amusing viewing, which is why I assume he loaded his videos on Zola
1553020	1558020	and Alfie Daze with a seething fury, because it does provoke a whirlwind of emotion within
1558020	1559020	the viewer.
1559020	1562840	However, to demonstrate this, he has to make the anger feel justified, which can often
1562840	1568080	cause a tone of outrage to be slightly manipulated, so you'll have Jack here acting open minded
1568080	1573180	for a comedic effect, and then seeing it contradicted by the knowledge of new information that proves
1573180	1575020	the most cynical outlook.
1575020	1579240	For example, he falsely assumes that Zola's calendar has 25 doors.
1579240	1582920	Well, I think the question is, why isn't it 60?
1582920	1587440	It's got 25 gifts in there, that means a new gift every single day of the month.
1587440	1588440	12 doors.
1588440	1589440	Huh?
1589440	1590440	12 doors.
1590440	1591440	It's got 12.
1591440	1592440	It's got 12 doors.
1592440	1595320	The offscreen person corrects him to 12.
1595320	1598280	Shock horror as 12 doors is less than 25.
1598280	1602440	This comedic formula is presented throughout the video, however this point in particular
1602440	1606840	is one that caught my eye, because it was presented as if 12 doors is not normal for
1606840	1611380	these sorts of calendars, and Zola has just chopped it in half, he continuously refers
1611380	1613080	to it as a half calendar.
1613080	1617840	It's better than your traditional calendar, because it's only got half of the doors for
1617840	1619100	ten times the price.
1619100	1623720	This implies that Zola has purposely reduced the number of doors to extort money from her
1623720	1628340	adoring fans, despite the fact that actually in places like Boots, John Lewis, and so on,
1628340	1633440	12 doors is fairly ordinary, though if like me you're not a regular shopper at such chains,
1633440	1634860	you might not realise that.
1634860	1639800	He also presents the calendar as costing a day's wages, to show how much a person would
1639800	1640800	have to give up.
1640800	1645660	For the low low price of just £50, or just one day's wages for your mum and dad, just
1645660	1646660	craze that.
1647540	1652260	I'd be fine, but it is repeated as a narrative, despite the fact that it lies on the assumption
1652260	1656540	that a person's parents would be working on minimum wage, well below minimum wage, but
1656540	1658180	I won't be that picky.
1658180	1662540	Considering that for a majority of childbearing ages, the percentage of those on minimum wage
1662540	1667020	is under 10%, it's a bit of a tall narrative, and then considering that most on minimum
1667020	1672440	wage would even expend money on a Christmas calendar, let alone a Zola one, is very tall.
1672440	1676580	The calendar is probably for upper middle class chums who have easy money to burn, I'm
1676580	1681820	sure those on minimum wage would be spending it on other things than a 50 quid calendar.
1681820	1686540	Jackmate basically paints the very sympathetic story of the working class veteran who has
1686540	1690620	done a hard day's labour and went and spent what little money they had left on a Zola
1690620	1694900	calendar for their daughter, and the look of joy on her little face when she was presented
1694900	1699680	it was undercut from the heartbreak when she opened door one and found a bauble, which
1699680	1702500	as riveting an image it is, is seldom the case.
1702540	1707100	And you know, I try to avoid being pedantic, though it is kind of who I am, but when you're
1707100	1711360	trying to make something seem worse than it actually is, you still have to be somewhat
1711360	1713020	accurate with the premises.
1713020	1718180	One of my pet peeves is when people use exaggerative humour, but exaggerate before applying the
1718180	1722820	humour, and then use the humour as a shield when people rightfully criticise their inaccurate
1722820	1723820	depiction.
1723820	1727400	Normally it's the exaggeration which is the source of the misinformation, but what
1727400	1731840	some sneaky people will do is they'll chuck in some slight misinformation and then base
1731840	1733600	the exaggeration around it.
1733600	1737800	A really good example off the top of my head in this instance is Racism Dog, it strikes
1737800	1741960	the balance of being completely inane with everything it does, and yet people take it
1741960	1746120	seriously enough to actually value what it's saying, and yet the light-hearted premise
1746120	1750040	means that if you criticise it, you'll have a load of people saying stop taking it so
1750040	1753880	seriously, despite the fact that those people are often the ones taking its statements the
1753880	1755160	most seriously.
1755160	1758760	People aren't necessarily challenging the delivery, they're challenging the implication.
1758760	1762860	Now it's fair to say that JackMate's video was not the first response to the topic
1762860	1766900	as he read out in his video, there were plenty of negative reviews upon release, and hopefully
1766900	1770840	I explain why people took a specific distaste to this calendar earlier.
1770840	1774360	However, he was the one who fanned the flames, and I don't really blame him for the way
1774360	1779240	he thought, but I do blame him for the delivery, which did follow the same format as described
1779240	1780240	earlier.
1780240	1782660	I'll leave a link in the description below so you can see for yourself.
1782660	1786120	There isn't much more to say about the Zoella video, although I do think it's framed very
1786120	1791040	cynically and the constant talk of exploitation is rather tiresome, everyone else can judge
1791040	1792520	it on their own terms.
1792520	1797320	However, when the Alfie Deyes situation came around, JackMate smelled blunt, and was raring
1797320	1802040	to call him out, I mean even his fans expected him to, after all it's right up his street,
1802040	1805800	however hopefully I showed earlier beyond the title, it's clear there wasn't much to
1805800	1808640	call him out for beyond a misunderstanding.
1808640	1813120	JackMate had also covered Alfie Deyes before on a video called My Opinion on Alfie Deyes,
1813120	1817160	half of which is fairly solid commentary, though he did seem to run off on a tangent
1817160	1822620	towards the end, and it never quite stabilised, so this situation came around and the algorithm
1822620	1827240	was obviously going to support such a video on him, however if you make a video, you have
1827240	1832280	to make a video, and so JackMate did, like his Zoella video on the surface, it was fine,
1832280	1836320	sharp, funny, fairly to the point, but once you look beyond the humour, certain points
1836320	1837720	become rather dubious.
1837720	1841760	A fair proportion of it are the sort of points that we've already discussed, the idea that
1841760	1846480	he was complaining about a lack of commodities, and was comparing those to the struggles of
1846480	1847480	others.
1847480	1852240	I realise I can't even use that, I'm gonna have to use this tap water instead.
1852240	1856720	So not only can he not use his ice, from his ice making machine, he can't even drink
1856720	1862720	his purified silver mounted distilled Voss H2O premium water from his fridge, what is
1862720	1863720	a man to do?
1863720	1869720	He's gotta drink normal water from a tap, like normal people, it's not fair!
1869720	1872280	Zoella didn't sell calendars for this shit!
1872280	1875600	Once again, video in the description below if you want to see it for yourself.
1875600	1879800	However I want to hone in on specific points outside of that narrative, because these ones
1879800	1882680	are fairly contributory to what he crafted.
1882680	1883680	For example this.
1883680	1886120	It's weird because he tweeted the video, that's all he did, just tweeted the video,
1886120	1890480	that got a lot of backlash, so he removed the tweet, but the video is still up, with
1890480	1892520	five mid-roll adverts.
1892520	1897360	Now at the time of this video, Daze had replaced the video tweet with a written apology addressing
1897360	1901080	it that is currently gone, but likely because he made a video apology.
1901080	1905200	So my initial thoughts were, well maybe Jack placed the video up after Daze deleted his
1905200	1909820	apology and missed it, but upon research I found by looking at times on people who replied
1909820	1913920	to Daze's initial apology, that it was still up well after the video was posted, so it
1913920	1917880	seemed Jack wasn't quite looking hard enough when he made the claim which paints Alfie
1917880	1920320	as someone who's just trying to dodge criticism.
1920320	1924720	A fairly trivial thing in a way, but if you're going to imply something about someone's
1924720	1928640	courage or character, then it's important that you do get the facts straight.
1928640	1933180	There are also a set of comments about how Alfie spends his money on items, such as personal
1933180	1934180	trainers.
1934180	1939680	Oh sorry, just a quick one, are personal trainers free or lover than a quid?
1939680	1940680	Or this.
1940680	1941680	Bought myself a t-shirt.
1941680	1947080	He's literally just buying everything now, I mean, stuff that's like the least essential
1947080	1949160	things in all, I thought you were meant to be spending a quid.
1949160	1952400	Bought myself a game for me and Zoe and my family and friends to play.
1952400	1953400	What?
1953400	1958120	In spite of the fact that we already know, and he says, that Alfie Daze was only spending
1958120	1962860	one quid on food and drink, the shock is clearly just for comedic effect, but once again, omitting
1962860	1966960	this information is a misframing of Alfie's video, and makes him seem much worse than
1966960	1969740	the actual video in context demonstrates.
1969740	1974240	To hone in on the narrative that really got under my skin, especially when it was delivered
1974240	1975240	well was this one.
1975240	1979300	Has he not realised that thousands of people in this country have no choice but to live
1979300	1981840	on that money every day, and they hate it?
1981840	1982840	Do you know what I mean?
1982840	1985600	They have families to support and they hate it, but he's struttin' about his mansion
1985600	1989240	like hahaha, he's well fun pretending to be poor.
1989240	1993800	This sounds all fine and moral when you have a firebrand like Jack made delivering it,
1993800	1995720	but his logic is this.
1995720	2000040	Person A commercialises something for fun that Person B does not have the choice to
2000040	2005840	do and detests, therefore Person A should not do it, which is logic that would encompass
2005840	2007860	a lot of modern challenges.
2007860	2012140	The reason why we don't lambast them is because they provide context that makes us
2012140	2017060	know that they're not mocking those suffering, we understand the context of something like
2017060	2020820	Deadly Twister for example, we're not mocking torture victims.
2020820	2025820	The only context that eluded days was mocking the poor was his original title, that he did
2025820	2029620	change, nothing else in the video reflected that, but by the time he changed this, people
2029620	2033620	almost needed to create their own reasoning to be angry at this otherwise.
2033620	2037700	Throughout JackMate's video, there's this perpetuated expectation that for some reason,
2037700	2041740	because he's spending one quid in one day, that he should wholly adopt the lifestyle
2041740	2046140	of an impoverished person, despite the fact that he gave no inclination of doing such
2046140	2049260	and that should have been evidence that he wasn't trying to do that.
2049260	2053280	This once again lies on the assumption that if you spend low amounts of money on food
2053280	2056580	and drink in a day, then you must be poor, which just isn't true, there are plenty
2056580	2060600	of people who spend as little amount of money as possible on said products, and likewise
2060600	2064860	there are people who are poor who just spend high amounts of money on lifestyle and therefore
2064860	2065980	have nothing left.
2065980	2070860	Correlation isn't causation, equally it's not the sole explanation, not in this scenario
2070860	2071860	at least.
2071860	2076860	JackMate is the ultimate commentator, in a way a populist brand of YouTuber pushing this
2076860	2081120	narrative that we have a set of out of touch elite vloggers who are business oriented and
2081120	2085700	have no idea how the other half live or what they want to see, and to be honest, he might
2085700	2090880	be right to an extent, but the narrative can't be found in every example, particularly in
2090880	2092820	the ones that we've discussed today.
2092820	2097620	However because there was some level of wrongdoing being committed, it allowed people to create
2097620	2102340	further narratives that went after the characters in question, more than it ever needed to,
2102340	2107940	and justify it because to some extent it does sound logical, but a lot of the points weren't,
2107940	2112580	and although they were well coordinated, they went after these people for the wrong reasons,
2112580	2115500	and that's something I can simply never endorse.
2115500	2120500	Zoella and Alfie Deyes made some bad decisions, and everyone turned out to stick that nail
2120500	2125680	into the coffin, partly because it's a fruitful topic, also because there's not much audience
2125680	2129980	crossover but there is a widespread appeal, and because vloggers and commentators have
2129980	2134520	never had quite the best relationship, and when it happened first time round, it may
2134520	2138940	have felt right, but for me looking back, I can't say I feel the same.
2138940	2143340	I think trying to say as much about their characters as people did was an overreaction,
2143340	2147240	that is coming from someone like me who loves character studies.
2147240	2151680	Having the strict moral code that many YouTubers seem to adopt in these scenarios to prove
2151680	2156360	these people wrong, would almost definitely lead to hypocrisy in any other dramatic situation
2156360	2159320	on YouTube, and in the real world.
2159320	2164120	I know that might not be a popular opinion, but it's my opinion, the right opinion.
2164120	2165120	Wink wink.
2165120	2169360	Anyhow, I always love to hear what people think, drop it down in the comments below,
2169360	2172480	and I will typically read them in the first few hours, and I will read the top comments
2172480	2174160	on a constant basis.
2174160	2178580	I also want to give a huge shout out to the editors, go check their content out, go give
2178580	2182680	them a subscription if you have the time, if you can, spare a minute, and go and send
2182680	2187080	them some love because they deserve it, the channel would not be where it is today without
2187080	2188080	their dedication.
2188080	2192180	If you want to contact me about anything specifically, you can reach me on Twitter, at the right
2192180	2195680	opinion, I'm always around on there, you can reach me on Facebook, I'll leave the link
2195680	2200280	to that in the pinned comment below, Discord too, I have a Discord server you'll love to
2200280	2204580	pop by in there, you can even reach me on email, but who the hell uses email?
2204580	2208640	Some people have reached on me on email actually, so there you have it.
2208640	2212320	But anyhow, I tried to make myself accessible, once again, thanks for all the support of
2212320	2216000	recent, hopefully this video has done something positive for you at least.
2216000	2219840	Until then, I'm the right opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
