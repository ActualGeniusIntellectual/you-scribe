0	5560	Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
5560	10580	too much free time, and today we're going to my favourite genre of all, music.
10580	14280	Because your boy here, he loves the tunes, it's pretty much what I'm raised on.
14280	18040	As I write this script, I'm actually currently listening to Mary's Prayer by Danny Wilson,
18040	21880	wasn't sure about it at first, but I'll say, sophisticated pop songs do tend to grow
21880	22880	on you.
22880	27280	Unfortunately, today's topic won't be exactly focusing on my adoration for music, no, today
27280	31640	we will be talking about a person called Austin Jones, who decided to take advantage
31640	34560	of the clout given by such a blessed industry.
34560	38920	However, to open this, I will at least be discussing some media related elements, because
38920	43940	music is a unique industry for so many reasons, and it generates so much creative variety
43940	46460	that is out there, particularly in the last few years.
46460	50280	As the internet has become increasingly prevalent in the distribution of content, we've seen
50280	54980	a real wave of music become popular that otherwise wouldn't ever have the chance.
54980	58720	There is a lot of music that originates from YouTube, I've spoken about this before,
58720	63820	but you have some teen boy, swooshed hair, bent over his acoustic guitar, staring into
63820	68380	the camera, singing a sincere song about how much he wants to hold you, and suddenly their
68380	72420	subscriber count explodes, regardless of how good the music actually is.
72420	76500	But at the same time, you have to give credit to the musical achievements that YouTube has
76500	82060	provided, from the early days of Chocolate Rain, to repopularising that weird trollolol
82060	83060	song.
83060	88020	We haven't seen such a wave of unique music since the early 1990s in many ways, it's
88020	92440	just unlike then when we had music blasting onto the scene with great furor, the modern
92440	97060	wave has been mostly downbeat, and mostly pretty depressing, and therefore it's never
97060	101220	felt like a huge shock, more just like a musical cigarette.
101220	107300	This is where we introduce the subject of today's video, Austin Jones, the blonde haired,
107300	109940	blue eyed, dreamboat.
109940	114500	But no, he's not just a pretty face, he's also a predator, and we're not just talking
114500	118900	about allegations here, he's pleaded guilty in court, this is all fairly certain at this
118900	119900	point.
119900	123780	Austin Jones himself is a 26 year old musician, fresh out of Illinois.
123780	128300	He wasn't the most identifiable of personalities, but he was clearly popular enough to amass
128300	133380	well over 500,000 subscribers, we don't know the exact amount as his channel was terminated
133380	137460	recently following his court case, but it was enough to make him matter.
137460	141940	Predominately he was a musician who typically focused on covers, original music, and also
141940	146820	acapellas, and making a fairly hefty career out of it, which we'll talk about later.
146820	152220	However he also did certain videos that I assume were to create a bond with his audience,
152220	156140	most of which are now unfortunately lost to the vaults of time, but nonetheless I think
156140	161500	we can take the remains and put the pieces back together and create some sort of picture,
161500	164500	and discuss that bond and how he exploited it.
164540	169340	Austin started his career in 2007, and although it certainly took a while to gain traction,
169340	174020	his continuous run of constant uploads and running off the popular genre paid its dues,
174020	176160	and gradually his videos gained traction.
176160	181160	This gave him more leverage to experiment with, and at some point he did these acapellas,
181160	185600	which were what really bolstered his career, and eventually his content ended up amassing
185600	191100	over 33 million views in total, alongside the sub count we discussed earlier.
191100	195720	Much in lieu of my other video on the TikTok predator the budday, this video will be unpacking
195720	199540	some of the build up, the abuse of power, and the subsequent moves he pulled out to
199540	204620	evade backlash, and indeed pull an almost unbelievable turnaround after a situation
204620	208700	that really could have finished his career, in fact the only thing that stopped him in
208700	211140	the end was the heavy hand of the law.
211140	216180	I remember when I first heard about this situation a couple years back in 2017, I wasn't making
216180	221100	content that remotely resembled the work I was doing today, but either way, I dismissed
221100	222100	him.
222100	225700	You know, he's gonna get what he deserves, I'm thankful that actually he's not gonna
225700	230620	be around, and to an extent that's true, he was a disgusting twat, but that was not the
230620	235860	end of it, no, and now with these new developments, we're about to find out why, and investigate
235860	237880	some deeper discussions beyond that.
237880	241700	You see, although the attention on him has been widely pursued in the last two years,
241700	246020	there have been people trying to bring attention to his behaviour since 2015.
246020	250640	Many of these attempts to no avail at all, with the most being a non-apology in which
250640	255580	Austin only demonstrates more of his manipulative tendencies, the years after were not just
255580	260260	successful for Austin, they were his most successful, and that's what I find deeply
260260	265860	troubling, and I think it's time we understand how exactly that happened, and how he loved
265860	267980	to abuse his power.
267980	273060	So without further ado, I suggest we pursue the curious case of Austin Jones.
297980	322880	In many ways, what we see with Austin Jones is a classic ascension to power.
322880	327880	He is the epitome of a teenage heartthrob, in that he represents the sort of lovely accessible
327880	331540	idol who is there for you, who understands how you feel.
331540	335320	Now unfortunately, or fortunately depending on your perspective, as his channel is no
335320	339340	longer in existence, we have to take what little archive knowledge we can obtain, but
339340	344380	I don't think it's too difficult to completely break down exactly why he found himself in
344380	345900	a position of power.
345900	350860	Firstly he was a YouTube OG, he set up his channel in 2007, he was allowed to excel on
350860	355900	a platform with less competition, and he was also ahead of the curve in many aspects.
355900	360820	YouTube exploded as a platform for actual professional musicians a few years after,
360820	363380	and Austin Jones was already there putting up covers.
363380	367960	Now his covers typically did well, appearing to exceed the number of views to the subscribers
367960	372240	he had fairly impressively, but as we well know, typically making covers isn't the
372240	374600	only way to hold on to the audience you have.
374600	380120	But you see, Austin Jones had the looks, and he also had the eye contact, and he also had
380120	381720	the choice for songs.
381720	382720	What do I mean?
382720	388180	But let's talk about One Direction, one of the most prolific boy bands of the 2010s.
388180	390160	Why were they so successful?
390160	394040	Well because of the young, impressionable teenage girls, but also because of how they
394040	395200	marketed to them.
395200	399060	Now one of the things that you become extremely aware of if you've listened to music in
399060	403400	a critical fashion was what one would call the second person perspective.
403400	408500	Second person perspective is focusing on the word you, it's a narrative perspective from
408500	413140	your point of view, and One Direction mastered it.
413140	416980	What makes you beautiful gotta be you.
416980	421860	The list goes on, and on, and on, and the reason that shameless musical executives did
421860	426540	this was because the vulnerable, insecure girl loves to be comforted by the cute, charming
426540	428980	boy who just wants to make you feel wanted.
428980	431180	Oh wait, that's a different twat.
431180	434740	I do apologise, there are just so many of them, especially early 2010s.
434740	440260	I do not know what we were on, but PG singles about how much boys love you was the in thing.
440260	444780	Austin Jones definitely played into that rule, having that sort of song that was addressed
444780	449280	to you, the listener, where he would tell you how valued or loved you are, he'd have
449280	453940	this cheeky look at the camera, and all you bitches were expected to swoon appropriately.
453940	458360	If anything's left, you can have a look at the comment sections on one of his very, very
458360	463340	old videos, back in the day, and you get the comments that are completely won over.
463340	467500	For another one of his videos, sake of falling in love, we can observe the comments.
493340	502040	If anyone can guess those YouTubers who voice them, you get a gold star from me, the right opinion.
502040	503920	Now that is just one page.
503920	508940	Of course, not all of these comments are alluding to Austin's looks or his romantic capabilities,
508940	513040	but they should show the sort of audience that he was appealing to at this point, the
513040	517700	sort of emotional character who cries whenever a blonde boy breathes in their direction.
517700	522260	He is very cleverly creating an audience that is vulnerable in of itself, and therefore
522260	525160	he can use that to his advantage, and so he did.
525160	529760	The sort of thing can be found on his Twitter, or what was his Twitter, because it's no longer there.
529760	534480	Well, it is there, but it's someone who clearly hasn't taken advantage of the notion of a parody account.
534480	537200	I mean, come on, you can be more creative than that.
537200	542400	But anyhow, his Twitter was conducted of firstly putting out vague, sensual tweets that make
542400	546240	the impressionable audience think, oh wow, this guy gets me.
546240	551160	At the same time, a lot of these tweets tended to focus on his vulnerability, or how indebted
551160	554220	he was to his fans, and this put him on their level.
554220	557220	It makes him seem more relatable or warm to an extent.
557220	559300	He owes you his life, guys.
559300	561800	Wow, he would do anything for you people.
561800	565060	He might not have made it this far if you hadn't bought his albums.
565060	568800	At the same time it guilt trips people who haven't bought the album, it's a good double
568800	572260	bind where he ends up favourably in either line of reasoning.
572260	577380	The other types of tweets he did were those which heavily relied on the interactions with his fans.
577440	582040	Now, there were even less examples of those, but I found one time where his page was archived
582040	587820	in 2013, and a high majority of the tweets were what, judging from the format, I believe
587820	592420	were quote tweets, in which he would regularly interact with his fans about their purchase
592420	596820	or enjoyment of Jones' content, though I did find this excellent tweet that definitely
596820	601800	shows a more flirtive side of Jones, which we are going to witness in a much more aggressive
601800	603260	form very soon.
603260	604700	For the new trace he writes,
609700	611300	Austin quaintly replies with
614900	618640	Now, to be frank, I don't really have a problem with comedic flirting, hell I do it all the
618640	622780	time with my mates, but at the same time, this is foreshadowing irony that this girl
622780	624540	clearly isn't aware of.
624540	629580	It's all banter until you realise that there is actually a slightly deeper context.
629580	634100	With his new power, Austin became quite aware of who he was appealing to, and one of the
634100	637940	other techniques that became quite prominent in his later content was the use of other
637940	642420	sizeable fanbases, typically if you have topics that are relating to someone with more of
642420	646660	a cult following, your sort of tribute to them will spill over into an appeal, so for
646660	652100	example if someone did an Ariana Grande or BTS acapella, they'd probably do very well,
652100	655100	although I doubt they'd make much money because it would be claimed.
655140	659760	And so Austin goes for the stans who are either gonna want to send you their heart or want
659760	663900	to eat yours out depending on how well you execute your behaviour, and this brings us
663900	668720	to the final positive but equally depressing point about Austin's appeal.
668720	673140	He was actually talented, terrible people can be incredibly talented, and although Austin's
673140	678040	music and covers themselves weren't indicative of anyone with exceptional flair, his acapella
678040	682340	covers definitely were, and I'm not gonna play them here because fair use on YouTube
682340	686200	is in ruins right now, but I'll leave a link to an archived version, and what he does is
686200	691460	quite exceptional, and it would require an incredible amount of concentration and perseverance,
691460	695840	there were very few people who could consistently layer themselves doing covers in such a tight
695840	699220	fashion and then do it again, and again, and again.
699220	703960	He was creating a brand for himself out of what is now quite a fairly exhausted genre.
703960	708820	With success comes power, and with power comes, well, let's find out.
712340	720580	Manipulation is the word of the day to day chaps, because what Austin Jones did on YouTube
720580	724720	was textbook manipulation of the algorithms to obtain success.
724720	728960	Now that is the story of the success of many YouTubers, you observe the trends, you work
728960	733900	out how you benefit off of it, and then you embark on the journey to become a successful
733900	734900	YouTuber.
734900	738280	In the case of Austin Jones, he worked out the audience that he wanted to obtain and
738280	739880	subsequently obtained them.
739880	745800	The year is 2015, although not as big as he would be, Austin Jones has successfully manipulated
745800	748920	the algorithms into a position of power.
748920	753480	However, as foreshadowed, there is a lot more to the story than just the manipulations of
753480	754480	the algorithms.
754480	758200	When you have an idol who is successful like Austin Jones, and you know he's out there
758200	762920	being so interactive, it makes you think, oh yeah, I've got this chance with this guy,
762920	767080	there's this clip of him at a One Direction slash 5 seconds of summer concert, he's being
767080	785320	thrown out, and all these girls are screaming his name, oh my god, it's Austin Jones!
785320	790540	He is absolutely reveling in this, and when he builds that relationship, he can then slide
790540	797480	into the DMs, and once he gets there, he plays off this sort of good cop, bad cop dynamic.
797480	801660	One side of him is incredibly grateful, so lovely and humble, and the other side of him
801660	806380	is more primitive, aggressive and dominative, and what he does is in these confrontations
806380	811340	he tends to mesh these two personas together fairly deftly to try and coerce what he wants
811340	812340	from people.
812340	816520	So we're gonna go trawling through this content, and identifying the various techniques he's
816520	817520	pulled off.
817520	820300	Now there are a load of examples of these, and to go through all of them, well we'd end
820300	825840	up going round in circles, so I want to take one example, this one, a series of texts I
825840	830320	found posted by Lauren Miller, I don't know if these are her own, but we can break it
830320	834420	down fairly comprehensively in the meantime, and I want you to put yourself in the shoes
834420	839140	of the adoring fangirl who is finally having the honour of speaking to their idol, who
839140	844780	has already solicited some form of imagery as shown in the text, and yet still wants
844780	845780	more.
845780	851320	What we see here in this message is the breaking of tone in the conversation, or well, supposed.
851320	855960	By saying let me be honest here, it implies that now he's going to be more sincere than
855960	856960	he has before.
856960	862540	Then he says, I'm having a really down night, this puts him in a position of vulnerability.
862540	866740	We already know he's tweeting about coping with depression, so in this he is using that
866740	870560	mental illness to place him in a position requiring support.
870560	871880	What is that support?
871880	876680	Well I think I know, but not satisfied with just that, he then puts the fan in a position
876680	877960	of exclusivity.
877960	882860	You see he's only chosen to talk to her, how blessed she should be that this huge public
882860	885860	figure has gone out of his way for her.
885860	890440	So what you have so far is multiple tactics used in the space of a few sentences, you
890440	894140	have sincerity, vulnerability, and exclusivity.
894140	898720	This pushes pressure onto someone who is probably already desperate to impress their idol, a
898720	903200	person who is also rather young, and probably rather impressionable, and then with all this
903200	905660	in mind, he goes in with a request.
905660	909600	And I'm pretty impressed that the girl in this instance said no to him.
909600	914160	Now for some people, no means no, but for Austin, no means the yes that hasn't quite
914160	915360	been said yet.
915360	919560	He presses again, and then the girl rejects again, and once again the girl replies very
919560	920560	responsibly.
920560	925140	At this point, even though this lass has spelled out the exact reasons why she doesn't want
925140	931180	to hand over any more content to this predatory creature, he acts confused, he doesn't understand,
931180	935580	pretty much trying to mentally exhaust the person, continuously asking the person to
935580	937180	justify their reasoning.
937180	941600	Now explanations in these instances are being built on premises, and what Austin here is
941600	946640	trying to do is reach the premises so he can perhaps invalidate them and thus invalidate
946640	951040	their reasoning, thus guilt tripping them into providing him with more content.
951040	953140	And she doesn't crack, which fair play.
953140	958020	She points out the age gap, he dismisses these 3 points as casually and says, oh guys,
958020	960700	this is just for fun, yes, great banter.
960700	964660	He then asks if he can offer something in return, and the girl justifiably says that
964660	968560	the fact that he is messaging her is more than enough, and I think what should be quite
968560	973300	clear now is that this girl is in a vulnerable position, to the point where she still clearly
973300	978980	idolises him in spite of these highly uncomfortable advances, and instead of taking a step back
978980	984420	and being able to humanise the situation, Austin Jones pushes on to achieve his only
984420	985420	goal.
985420	989260	It's the messages after that become a vault to his ever stranger mind.
989260	993380	After the girl said that talking to him is an honour, he takes this as a chance to once
993380	999240	again hold his power over her, he brags, he receives thousands of messages, loads of people
999240	1004340	out there wanting to talk to this world famous Austin Jones, and yet he is talking to her
1004340	1005780	out of everyone.
1005780	1012040	What he is trying to do right now is alienate the person from these objections of inappropriateness.
1012040	1016400	This person has raised the point that she is 14, but Austin isn't targeting her because
1016400	1021360	she's 14, he's targeting her because he was just randomly scrolling through and has decided
1021360	1027440	that the lucky winner of the Austin Jones luxury lewd lotto will be this lovely lass.
1027440	1029020	He just wants to talk to her.
1029020	1030020	Age?
1030020	1031020	What?
1031020	1032020	What's age?
1032540	1034140	Some silly concept?
1034140	1036060	Who cares about age?
1036060	1040100	At the same time he implicitly degrades the person he's talking to, despite the fact
1040100	1045240	that he promoted that exclusivity earlier, it was tainted with a tone of disposability.
1045240	1049520	There are thousands of people just like her, and he can just scroll to another DM and find
1049520	1053460	another fangirl who will give him what he needs so desperately.
1053460	1056740	Through this he creates a contradiction, on one hand he claims that he can go and get
1056740	1061060	this content from any of his other fans, but at the same time he is clearly driven to obtain
1061100	1065500	it from this one fangirl, or else he would've just given up on the first try.
1065500	1069380	Maybe that's because he can't obtain content like that from anywhere else, or maybe that's
1069380	1073560	because he just wants to get his way, given the fact that he did solicit content from
1073560	1076860	other people in the same boat, it might well be both.
1076860	1081740	I think he clearly has some kind of twisted desire to take advantage of this power dynamic
1081740	1086100	that he holds, and fair play to that girl for being able to turn him down, because many
1086100	1088060	people didn't.
1088060	1092420	Austin is clearly Austin's middle name, and you can see this in the final few DMs
1092420	1093420	that have been published.
1093420	1098300	The girl asks him, appealing to him on the grounds of human decency, saying that would
1098300	1103100	you do something that you're not comfortable with, aware that a fan is presenting her perspective,
1103100	1107780	he turns around and says, well yes actually if I wanted to make them happy, thus once
1107780	1112700	again undermining her reasoning, blatantly deceptive, and extremely malicious.
1112700	1116860	Oh and look, he'll twerk too now, how charitable.
1116860	1122120	Basically what you see here is Jones completely taking advantage of that fan admiration, singling
1122120	1126420	them out in conversation, using that power to intimidate them, and then using various
1126420	1130020	mental techniques to try and coerce what he wants out of them.
1130020	1134420	He's having a hard time, he really needs those twerking videos guys, he needs them to get
1134420	1135580	through the night.
1135580	1140820	My heart weeps for this poor soul who may never have the twerking videos he needs so
1140820	1141820	desperately.
1141820	1147540	Now, I can't guarantee these DMs are real, but I present the evidence today under the
1147540	1152220	fact that judging by the conviction and the way his language corroborates in various other
1152220	1155820	DMs, that this is extremely, extremely credible.
1155820	1156820	What other DMs?
1156820	1160860	Well there's this one where he was giving another person the exclusive treatment, he
1160860	1165820	wanted to get to know the person through the medium of twerking, and then she says no.
1165820	1171180	Back and forth, same old shtick, he says obviously you don't want to make me happy, which will
1171180	1175900	obviously cut to the heart of the insecure fan, because having someone pass judgement
1175900	1179120	on your intentions can feel extremely harmful.
1179120	1184180	So once again he pretty much tries any manipulation tactic under the sun, and I wanted to finish
1184180	1189540	this part on this one clip, just so people know what we were dealing with here.
1189540	1199300	It's just cuz, it's for the benefit of both of us, cuz like, I'm horny like all the time,
1199300	1205300	so if we just keep talking, I'm probably gonna ask for videos on like a daily basis, and
1205300	1208300	then I'm gonna feel like a dick, and then you guys are gonna reject me and I'm just
1208300	1212300	gonna feel like shit so, it's just like easier this way.
1212300	1218700	Yeah sorry I'm a guy, but I still love you.
1218700	1224980	Yes, so so classy, and like any situation, he was called out, and as it started spreading
1224980	1229540	he started begging all these people in the DMs, oh please don't do this to me, and as
1229540	1234420	the uproar spread and people got more angered and his fans were turning to him and saying
1234420	1240420	Austin what is going on, he decided that he was going to do one thing, and that was set
1240420	1248180	the record straight.
1248180	1252180	Austin Jones is face down with all these very serious situations, he's being hit
1252180	1257820	on all sides, and at the end of June 2015, he decided to do the very smart thing and
1257820	1266340	post a video response, no not that one, that's too honest to be his quote official response,
1266340	1270820	no we're going to be talking about this one, namely setting the record straight.
1270820	1274580	Now there's a lot to say about this video, and I'll try and cover it all without being
1274580	1279860	caught up in the two minor things, but once again, what you witness is success and manipulating
1279860	1282500	a situation that really he had no right to.
1282500	1287620	Now it's fair to say that now the video has received overwhelmingly negative feedback,
1287620	1291860	many people from all over communities banded together to make sure he was shown up, but
1291860	1296780	at the same time, looking at the old ratings, he was doing alright, and Austin wasn't
1296780	1300660	really appealing to any of the people who actually care about internet affairs, but
1300660	1304440	more to his loyals who were going to stick around no matter what, and judging by some
1304440	1307580	statistics that we'll see later, it might just have worked.
1307580	1311820	So let's talk about how Austin Jones set the record straight.
1311820	1315620	He's in this situation, he's up against the wall, he has to hold on to the fans that
1315620	1320340	he has, and he has the main platform to do it, he knows what he's done, it's pretty
1320340	1324100	terrible, and regardless of the delivery, he's gonna come under some fire, so what
1324100	1328980	he firstly does here is present himself as the reasonable mediator, and I want to play
1328980	1333780	you this opening clip, because there is so many techniques you can break down in it alone.
1358980	1366220	You see lads, here he plays a very two sided card, on one hand, he completely understands
1366220	1370980	that people hate him, and have those negative opinions, and all he's asking to do is to
1370980	1376220	hear him out, but in his delivery, you'll be able to break down some very slight techniques,
1376220	1380380	firstly he implies that people will be receiving the truth from this video, when of course,
1380380	1383480	when there is only one truth and no one is ever going to see the complete truth, there
1383480	1387820	are just testimonies, the closest you're going to get to the truth are the screenshots,
1387820	1390460	and yeah, you're not going to be bringing them out are you?
1390460	1395460	Another great word he uses is the word mistakes, because although it's an admission of misconduct,
1395460	1400580	mistake is a rather forgiving word, as it implies the person was not acting with necessarily
1400580	1405380	ill intent when they behaved in such a way, so already although he hasn't actually said
1405380	1410500	anything of substance to respond to the criticism, he has already used a few rhetorical devices
1410500	1413860	to elicit sympathy from his more easily influenced viewers.
1413860	1415900	I now want to play you this excerpt.
1443860	1454260	Here we can see a similar mechanism, he apologises but simultaneously downplays his crime so
1454260	1455900	people are more forgiving.
1455900	1460020	He asked his fans for twerking videos, you know twerking, the dance moves, like the floss
1460020	1461620	or the Macarena.
1461620	1465260	He obviously fails to mention that many of these fans were underage, and the additional
1465260	1469480	details that we've indulged ourselves with, and we will indulge ourselves with later on,
1469480	1471720	but there is still more in this segment.
1471720	1475400	So he speaks about the YouTuber who has brought this to people's attention, I assume he's
1475400	1479900	referring to D Fizzy or Damon Fizzy who was one of the few people to actually call him
1479900	1485680	out in 2015, but he's not going to name names, how courteous of him, because he knows what
1485680	1490000	it's like to have been mercilessly attacked and he doesn't want to do that, but in this
1490000	1494880	instance this isn't a courtesy, this is a tactic to make sure people aren't seeing any
1494880	1499320	other perspectives and do not know where they are coming from, bar his own, which is also
1499320	1501680	why he has comments turned off.
1501680	1506320	Also notice how he uses aggressive verbs when he describes how these people have dealt with
1506320	1511800	him, they've blasted it out there, it makes the people he's talking about sound more instigatory.
1511800	1515920	We've seen a lot of drama where people have felt the need to play the victim, Austin isn't
1515920	1520540	doing that exactly, but he is implicitly leading people who may be sympathetic of his cause
1520540	1522500	to that exact conclusion.
1522500	1527360	All these people going after poor Austin for his old mistakes and he's learned from them,
1527360	1531640	he's ashamed, and now they're just blasting it out on the internet.
1531640	1537360	Since this started online, there are a lot of rumours and a lot of lies, they're just
1537360	1540620	not true, nothing ever went further.
1540620	1544600	Now this is a blatant lie, but also one that he could get away with at the time, because
1544600	1549480	at that point the evidence hadn't been widespread and affirmative enough to lead people to different
1549480	1553840	conclusions, so this allowed him to hold that narrative, which although on one side felt
1553840	1558200	like he was admitting something, it wasn't like he could deny it, so it wasn't exactly
1558200	1559760	reasonable on his behalf.
1559760	1564000	There's a load more in between, talking about how he was on tour, how this hit him,
1564000	1567880	and then he plays a victim card, but not in the way that you'd expect.
1567880	1574480	A lot of people ask, why did the initial statement take so long to get up?
1574480	1580700	I put up a text statement and apology addressing the situation, but it took me about a week
1580700	1583680	to do so.
1583680	1587600	People thought that I was being a coward, people thought that I didn't want to confront
1587600	1593440	the situation, they thought that I was just blowing it off, that's not true.
1593440	1596240	As I said, I was on the road, I was on tour.
1596240	1601440	We were all the way in Boston, so we had to make the drive all the way back from Boston
1601440	1602440	to Chicago.
1602440	1609160	On that drive, the only thing I did was look at my phone and look at all the hate and death
1609160	1611280	threats.
1611280	1612600	I got lost in it.
1612600	1617980	I would read every little comment, every little person telling me to kill myself, every person
1617980	1622720	telling me that life wasn't worth living for me anymore.
1622720	1629760	And I'm a pretty insecure person, to where negative comments like that really impact
1629760	1630760	me.
1630760	1635600	It's not something I can just brush off.
1635600	1642760	That entire ride home, I read those comments and I began researching different suicide
1642760	1643760	methods.
1643760	1647340	When we got back, I didn't even step foot in my house.
1647340	1655000	My family took me immediately to the hospital and I was hospitalized for my suicidal tendencies.
1655000	1660660	So no, I wasn't cowering, I wasn't avoiding the situation.
1660660	1664360	I was in a hospital.
1664360	1669800	I had no internet connection, I had no connection to social media, so I couldn't put out a
1669800	1670800	statement.
1670800	1671800	I wanted to.
1671800	1672800	I wanted to apologize.
1672800	1678320	I wanted to confront it immediately, but I couldn't.
1678320	1682700	As soon as I got out of the hospital, the next day, that's when I put it up.
1682700	1687040	So that's why the initial statement took so long to get out.
1687040	1692080	And this is the thing, in some respects, it's a really obvious victim card to the critical
1692080	1693080	audience.
1693080	1698240	What he's done here is he's smartly played the point as proxy to the not so critical
1698240	1699240	viewer.
1699240	1703360	You see, if we respond to criticism by pointing out the hate we've received, we are often
1703360	1707580	called out for changing the conversation and not confronting the criticism.
1707580	1713320	In this scenario, however, Austin has used the hate he received as a direct response
1713320	1714320	to the criticism.
1714320	1719120	He couldn't do something because of the hate he received, which is still somewhat
1719120	1723200	awkward as an argument, but not as much as it could have been, and serves as a way to
1723200	1728000	convey his victimhood without being a necessarily invalid response.
1728000	1732440	The video is meant to be a response to a lot of the criticism he's received, and it does
1732440	1737560	do that in a way, but it constantly detours down the road of the hard times that he's
1737560	1739020	having as a response.
1739020	1743080	This can be particularly found in the extended anecdote throughout the final part of his
1743080	1747400	video where he talks about his life and the struggles that he's experienced, and how
1747400	1751960	that created the mindset that led him to do these fun and goofy things.
1751960	1756520	The biggest question I get asked is why?
1756520	1758760	Why did this happen?
1758760	1761760	Why did I ask for those things?
1761760	1767760	So in order to figure out why, you have to look at the reasons, and the reasons lie in
1767760	1774540	my past, and in what I've experienced through life, and how I even got to that point.
1774540	1780160	I experienced death and loss at a very young age.
1780160	1782160	I had an older sister.
1782160	1784620	She passed away when she was ten years old.
1784620	1787100	I was six years old at the time.
1787100	1792360	I went through a series of funerals when I was very young.
1792360	1797780	Most were distant relatives that I either didn't even know at all, or I had only seen
1797780	1802140	on a few occasions, but I was so young that I really didn't know who they were.
1802140	1806780	I barely saw my father.
1806780	1812180	My parents divorced at a very, very young age, and the last time I saw him was when
1812180	1814500	I was eight years old.
1814500	1820780	My father was an alcoholic and a drug addict, and he couldn't get control of his life because
1820780	1821780	of it.
1821780	1826900	When I was sixteen, a few months before he passed away, my family and I, we went through
1826900	1828220	a house fire.
1828220	1833380	We were away visiting relatives, and somebody broke into our house, stole some things, and
1833380	1835340	burned the entire house down.
1835340	1840180	About a month after my father passed away, my grandfather passed away, and I was very
1840180	1841980	close to my grandfather.
1841980	1846680	After that happened, that's when I began self-harming.
1846680	1851620	I used to cut my wrists, and I'm over three years clean of that now.
1851620	1865300	All of these life events, all of these deaths, this loss left me with really deep, deep depression.
1865300	1874180	I was an insecure, depressed guy, and I began searching for attention in the wrong ways,
1874180	1878620	asking fans for those things.
1878620	1880940	It was because I was desperate for attention.
1880980	1883780	I was desperate for reassurance.
1883780	1886380	I wanted to feel good about myself.
1886380	1889880	At the time, I thought it was just fun and goofy.
1889880	1893340	Like I said, doesn't excuse my actions, doesn't justify it.
1893340	1895280	That's not why I told you all of that.
1895280	1901440	I told you it so that you would understand why I was that desperate, why I was even asking
1901440	1902580	for those things.
1902580	1907940	It was that depression piling up into me searching for attention.
1907940	1912560	A lot of his evidence of his experiences are things that are completely impossible
1912560	1917820	to verify, which although plausible, still inspires scepticism with the context of what
1917820	1919660	we now know he has done.
1919660	1920660	For example...
1920660	1926700	So, something else that I want to talk about is people saying that you're only sorry that
1926700	1928260	you got caught.
1928260	1931100	You know, you apologise because you got caught.
1931100	1933960	You don't actually feel sorry.
1933960	1936020	That's so far from the truth.
1936020	1943800	And there are a few actual examples that show that before I went on tour.
1943800	1949020	And he presents these as quote actual examples, but they're impossible to completely prove
1949020	1953900	and yet he presents them as the counter narrative that he clearly regrets what he did.
1953900	1958500	Every single piece of evidence is circumstantial, but I guess that's good enough for some people.
1958500	1961700	Finally, I want to bring your attention to this clip.
1961700	1969060	On my last tour, a few months ago, I started going back to therapy for this specific reason.
1969060	1976180	Because I regretted it so much and I couldn't move past it.
1976180	1977540	I couldn't stop thinking about it.
1977540	1982300	I couldn't stop feeling like absolute shit for what I had done.
1982300	1986420	So I went back to therapy before I left for tour.
1986940	1993740	Also, a few months before this became public, I talked to a couple of my coworkers, if you
1993740	1998140	want to call them that, one of which is very popular online.
1998140	2002860	If you're part of this specific music scene, you'd know exactly who he is if I told you
2002860	2003860	who he was.
2003860	2009060	So this is a pretty big and I'd like to consider reputable man.
2009060	2010460	I went to him with this.
2010460	2013740	I told him my entire past.
2013740	2019100	I told him that I felt so guilty for this and that I regret it and that I wanted to
2019100	2021620	confess all of this in the video.
2021620	2027780	Come clean about it, just get it off my chest so I can stop living with the guilt and officially
2027780	2029860	apologize to everybody.
2029860	2031460	He told me not to.
2031460	2037020	He told me that it would only hurt my career and what I did wasn't even that bad and that
2037020	2039020	I should just not even think about it.
2039020	2040220	I just shouldn't do it.
2040220	2044320	Firstly, he goes the Donald Trump route of talking about how he spoke to a man who was
2044320	2045420	very reputable.
2045420	2050620	Of course, never naming any names, but he's appealing to his authority in this instance,
2050620	2055380	and then he follows it with the fact that this very reputable person actually said demanding
2055380	2060860	twerking videos from fans, that's not bad, and he leans on that authority to justify
2060860	2063060	why he hasn't spoken about it.
2063060	2067720	It's embarrassingly transparent, and it's a real shame that this actually worked.
2067720	2071640	This screenshot is the one taken at the 2017 allegations.
2071640	2075560	There was only one screenshot before then, but it was briefly after he uploaded, which
2075560	2081640	was the classic 301 views mechanism, and as you can see, that like to dislike ratio speaks
2081640	2082640	for itself.
2082640	2086320	People wanted to believe him, and he gave them enough to make them believe him, so we
2086320	2091160	can assume the flood of dislikes came after, and this received insignificant coverage first
2091160	2092160	time around.
2092160	2097020	The people who watched it tended to defend him, so with the people who mattered to him
2097020	2101020	on his side, he was ready to battle on I guess.
2101020	2102420	Would he turn it around?
2102420	2105900	Well, kinda know the answer, but let's find out anyway.
2105900	2115100	After this video, it's clear that he had rescued enough of his reputation to appease
2115100	2119060	the masses that mattered to him, despite the significant evidence suggesting that he was
2119060	2120900	a less than savoury individual.
2120900	2126180	He took a hiatus, waited for many people to forget like they do, you know, wait until
2126180	2130660	his memory suppresses the severity of what he did, you wanna know how long it took people
2130660	2131660	to forget?
2131660	2140580	Go on, take a guess, take a stab in the dark, a year, half a year, no, one month, and these
2140580	2145940	were the ratings on his first actual video back, which clearly had some symbolism.
2145940	2150240	My god, what a poor soul, it's clear in this video he's trying to use the music
2150240	2155280	to convey his victimhood, and in this instance it seems he's the victim of his own twisted
2155280	2156320	urges.
2156320	2161360	Press 1 in the chat if you too shed a tear for the trials and tribulations of Austin
2161360	2164680	Jones, the man who has gone through enough.
2164680	2168520	After this he decided he was going to release more music, covers, and originals.
2168520	2173040	Another one of his videos back was a collaboration with his friends who I'm sure are very grateful
2173040	2178480	to be associated with this specimen, or maybe they knew and the clout was worth it, I dunno.
2178480	2183760	The videos performed okay, but all this was to change when he decided to record acapella
2183760	2184760	videos.
2185240	2190640	It was like 30, 40 second shorts of him layered over himself singing, and it was fairly impressive,
2190640	2192540	and it did decently for views.
2192540	2196840	So with this in mind, Austin thought, well what if I turn these into full songs, and
2196840	2200340	so he did, and the views were insane.
2200340	2204800	Every one of the acapella videos accumulated over a million views, as you can see, what
2204800	2209800	he did was cover songs and albums from bands who had a real cult following, and therefore
2209800	2214120	benefited off a fanbase that was probably so committed to their idols that they didn't
2214120	2218560	really think about the possible background of this suspect individual, and to be honest,
2218560	2223440	I wouldn't expect them to, YouTube probably chucked in their recommended, if I researched
2223440	2228040	every person who I've watched and whose videos I've enjoyed, I'd probably be rather
2228040	2230640	dissatisfied with what I find.
2230640	2234960	And the sad thing is that these videos are actually really good, and it's clear why
2234960	2236160	they did so well.
2236160	2240800	Jones is clearly a highly committed creator who puts a lot of effort into his work, and
2240800	2245680	in this period he experienced some of his most impressive growth, and so it makes sense,
2245680	2250440	but it was still disturbing that so many people subscribed to this guy not having awareness
2250440	2254640	of who they were supporting, and how they may have been in his sights as well.
2254640	2258920	The evidence that people brought forward initially was viewed as insufficient, and the people
2258920	2263560	who acknowledged it similarly dismissed it, and many people began to make up excuses for
2263560	2268880	why his behaviour was acceptable, well he apologised, well it wasn't a big deal, oh
2268880	2273200	guys, is it really worth the drama, why can't we just get along?
2273200	2275760	You're merely postponing the inevitable.
2275760	2279800	This is the problem when people are in denial about their idol, they make up these very
2279800	2285520	questionable explanations to rationalise what they want to like, and that's the most dangerous
2285520	2289840	thing, because you are handing him back power that he desperately does not deserve, the
2289840	2292480	power that enabled him in the first place.
2292480	2296840	When he was first called out in 2015, he was removed from the tours that he was on, this
2296840	2302400	was a huge back and forth in which many people who wanted to stop him had to really push
2302400	2303660	to get him held off.
2303660	2308040	The two tours in question back then were the Grow Wild tour, and the Warped tour, which
2308040	2313120	D Fizzy was on as well, and once again, companies only want to do so much to step in.
2313120	2317700	With enough public pressure, certain places may cave, but at the same time, if Austin
2317700	2322400	has enough support or at least lack of criticism from his circle, then he will be welcomed
2322400	2326600	back with open arms, and more importantly, if there are people who are willing to buy
2326600	2331940	his records, there tends to be an amoral record executive willing to sign and distribute his
2331940	2336800	content because they can make some fat stacks as well, and after all, what is morality when
2336800	2338000	there's money involved.
2338000	2342260	The following clip is from D Fizzy's video in which he reads out emails from companies
2342260	2345320	after he called Austin Jones out for what he was doing.
2345320	2346320	Here is one of them.
2346320	2350440	This game is blank, and I own and operate the blank and blank.
2350440	2351800	I have been promoting content for 30 years.
2351800	2352800	I'm not a kid.
2352800	2355080	Besides being a content promoter, I spend my free time being a part of many organizations
2355080	2356280	aimed at stopping bullies.
2356280	2359220	Internet bullies has led to many suicides, more than most people think, and more than
2359220	2360220	is reported to the news.
2360220	2364920	I am aware of the Austin Jones situation that you have managed to trend since yesterday,
2364920	2366120	and I know this kid personally.
2366120	2370800	I will set aside his issues as he will have to deal with them and his consequences.
2370800	2374660	What I want to deal with is your incredible need to continue to post about this issue.
2374660	2376140	I think you made your point.
2376140	2378220	At this point, you have become an internet troll.
2378220	2379380	What is your ultimate goal?
2379380	2380800	To have this kid kill himself?
2380800	2381880	Is that what you want?
2381880	2385140	You are a bully, the worst kind, an internet bully.
2385140	2387980	You say you just want to look out for other people and warn them.
2387980	2389140	You have accomplished that.
2389140	2393660	I would implore blank to remove you from the tour for being an internet bully.
2393660	2398740	I have counted 46 posts you have made to Twitter in the past 19 hours with thousands and thousands
2398740	2401380	of comments tagging him, just blasting Austin Jones.
2401380	2405140	Unless you want a dead body at your feet, I would ask blank to tell you to stop, and
2405140	2409620	I would ask him to remove you from the tour, as you are an embarrassment to his organisation.
2409620	2410620	And that's what happened.
2410620	2415200	Allegedly, D Fizzy brought this up with Austin Jones' manager, Brian Stars, and he decided
2415200	2419540	that actually, it was worth changing the conversation, because when someone brings into question
2419540	2423580	your client's behaviour, they bring into question your association with them as well.
2423580	2427700	Now, of course, that is just a testimony, but D Fizzy's been pretty on the money so
2427700	2432020	far, not to mention he emailed the manager of the tour, Kevin Lyman, who said he'd
2432020	2436380	look into it, and we all know what that means, and what this led to was a load of ping pong
2436380	2440740	of who was on the tour, who was off the tour, and D Fizzy got kicked off for a bit and then
2440740	2445680	he got back on and then Austin was going to come back on too, and it was completely exhausting.
2445680	2449500	And then the owner of the tour replied, Damon, I think you were starting to tread on thin
2449500	2450500	ice.
2450500	2451500	Be careful.
2451500	2456280	Unfortunately, this is what happens when the prospect of removing someone that might affect
2456280	2461260	their ticket sales occurs, and it's only when another outcome that the actual controversy
2461260	2464960	may affect ticket sales and the attempts of other guests comes into account that these
2464960	2466900	people actually paid attention.
2466900	2469540	However, at least he was off the tour, right?
2469540	2474340	Well unfortunately, as Austin garnered further success and more clout and more power to throw
2474340	2479020	around due to an increasing fanbase, it meant that people were going to work with him regardless,
2479020	2483180	and that's one of the greatest problems when you make a terrible person successful.
2483180	2489020	Even if you and 95% of the industry refuse to work with them, the 5% who decide that
2489020	2493460	they can work with them are normally the worst people, and then they make a lot of
2493460	2497960	money, and then before you know it, they might be the ones in the industry with influence.
2497960	2499780	It's a very dangerous cycle.
2499780	2504080	In the instance of Jones, Brian Stars claimed that he had dropped in, but D Fizzy alleged
2504080	2508660	that he actually has evidence of the contrary, and I wouldn't necessarily doubt him.
2508660	2513180	What that shows is that money talks, Austin Jones was selling his own tours, selling his
2513180	2516220	own music, and no one could stop him.
2516220	2520860	Back in 2015, commentary wasn't really a significant genre, and the videos calling
2520860	2525620	Jones out weren't impactful in a way that they might be today, and commentary is important
2525620	2530220	for this reason because we're not attached to that industry, and as shown in the D Fizzy
2530220	2534920	situation, the fact that Austin and Damon were both in that circle, calling Austin out
2534920	2537060	can really affect your career.
2537060	2541580	Having an independent voice is important in those scenarios, and unfortunately it's clear
2541580	2543700	that they were nowhere to be found.
2543700	2546460	And then fast forward later, the owner of the tour said I would still be on the tour
2546460	2549620	and I wouldn't be kicked off, but then I guess he randomly changed his mind because then
2549620	2553180	he kicked me off the lineup, and I had to contact him and be like, why?
2553180	2558020	I had to actually go to his office and beg to be back on the tour, and he had told me
2558020	2562740	that I should apologize to Austin, and he set up a phone call, but can we go back to
2562740	2567960	... He had so much potential in his music career, I guess, so people constantly wanted
2567960	2569040	to protect him.
2569040	2572180	The higher up people wanted to protect him, and this is how I was treated.
2572180	2573180	This is the email I received.
2573180	2575900	It says, Damon, are you up for that call Monday with Austin?
2575900	2577740	I spoke to him, and he would like this.
2577740	2581140	So they basically wanted me to set up a call with Austin and apologize to him and make
2581140	2583060	amends, but I did not do that, obviously.
2583060	2588540	The only reason why I even went to the meeting to talk to him and try to get back on the
2588540	2591620	tour is because I had already announced to my viewers that I was going to meet them,
2591620	2595460	and I was so excited because I went on the year before, and it literally changed my life.
2595460	2600780	And can we talk about the constant manipulation that he was doing to his fans for years, and
2600780	2602320	it was constantly justified?
2602320	2605440	But the fact that no one took it serious because it wasn't illegal content, it was
2605440	2607960	just twerking, it got to this fucking level.
2607960	2608960	This is recent.
2608960	2609960	This is from May.
2609960	2612880	When I called him out, everyone's like, oh, these screenshots are from two years ago.
2612880	2613880	He's changed.
2613880	2614880	No.
2614880	2619400	The fact that people justified and defended it and believed his stupid ass bullshit apology,
2619400	2621720	he just got comfortable again and kept doing it.
2621720	2626160	When you have a strong addiction like this to child pornography, it doesn't change overnight.
2626160	2627160	You know what I mean?
2627160	2631160	He continued touring, his career continued growing, and he was continuously able to have
2631160	2634220	access to underage girls.
2634220	2636320	And now, we're left here.
2636320	2639800	What you have now is a situation where Austin is finding his stride.
2639800	2644280	He's almost immune to criticism, becoming incredibly successful, and his detractors
2644280	2645880	have been silenced.
2645880	2649880	But he's allegedly promised to be better, and explained his mental situation.
2649880	2653760	I mean, if he's genuinely remorseful, he wouldn't do it again, would he?
2653760	2663340	Now ladies and gentlemen, do I have a surprise for you?
2663340	2667720	People say to me, James, some of your videos get very, very long, don't they?
2667720	2668720	And you know what?
2668720	2669720	They do.
2669720	2671340	But I don't intend to make them that way.
2671340	2676900	Every video I set out typically to be around four parts, maybe 30 minutes, and my videos
2676900	2680920	that have performed the best with the click through rate typically do end up around that
2680920	2681920	time.
2681920	2686720	But sometimes, you just find more and more and more to talk about, and Austin Jones is
2686720	2691760	the Pandora's box that once opened released All Hell Upon The World.
2691760	2692760	What is this hell?
2692760	2697360	Well, we had our warning, he said he'd learn, he was in a dark place, and suddenly he was
2697360	2699440	at the peak of his success.
2699440	2700640	So let me set the scene.
2700640	2706000	It was August 2016, approximately one month after Jones had released his acapella version
2706000	2711320	of I Write Sins, not Tragedies by Panic at the Disco, this video was performing well,
2711360	2716620	and his other video, prior to that, Welcome To The Black Parade, was also incredibly successful.
2716620	2721600	And of course, even if you're successful, you can be in a dark place, I completely understand
2721600	2722600	that.
2722600	2726380	But at the same time, this should prove that certain circumstances that he cited as present
2726380	2730900	in his previous explanation were no longer there, and he knows better at this point.
2730900	2733000	He had denounced his actions.
2733000	2738000	And this followed through to May 2017, when he was achieving continued success with his
2738000	2739420	acapella performances.
2739420	2741220	There is no excuse.
2741220	2744580	And this is the thing, the following details that we should note don't just show how
2744580	2749220	selfish he was in the past, how he was only doing it for himself, but open a whole new
2749220	2753540	dimension of this messed up, cruel, sadistic person.
2753540	2758300	This is the guy who apologised and moved past it, and let me make this clear, these court
2758300	2766460	cases bring forward two new victims, Victim A in 2017, May, and Victim B in August 2016,
2766460	2769140	the two previous scenarios that I was explaining.
2769140	2772340	So let's talk about the details, which are very worrying.
2772340	2776500	What really highlights his incredibly perverted nature was the fact that he always seemed
2776500	2781240	obsessed with his fans being 14, to the point where he would actually make sure they would
2781240	2786080	stay out their age, would wear more suggestive clothing, and even encourage the people to
2786080	2788980	stay up, even if they had school the next day.
2788980	2791140	After all, who cares about school?
2791140	2795880	Even when, in this instance, Victim A was tired, Jones pressed on, she said she was
2795880	2801120	gonna pass out, and Jones demanded that she take it seriously, Austin needs his kicks
2801120	2805440	after all, but alas, no clapping, damn underwear.
2805440	2810300	So far this is legitimately disgusting, the way that Jones is completely disregarding
2810300	2816080	this person's actual life and placing his own desires above all else, this is his priority,
2816080	2822240	a complete disregard for anyone else's humanity to pursue the goal of his own twisted fulfilment,
2822240	2828120	he can't even wait a night, however what happens next is unbelievably bad, and I would
2828120	2830920	recommend strapping in for this part.
2830920	2835760	Jones moves the conversation into very explicit territory, creating discussion about bonus
2835760	2838600	and whether this girl has the capacity to deliver this.
2838600	2842680	I will not dwell on this for too long, but it has to be acknowledged, so I can now comment
2842680	2847760	on how much of an awful person he really is, I can't emphasise that enough, because even
2847760	2852480	when the conversation moves in this direction deplorably, he's still manipulating the
2852480	2857720	environment and using his dissatisfaction as cause to move the conversation down a more
2857720	2863200	graphic road, basically it's not provocative enough so he can't pop a boner, if the old
2863200	2867960	video of him talking about how horny he was wasn't enough admission that his intention
2867960	2873920	for gathering these videos is quite clear this person was 14 years old, 14, it's perverted,
2873920	2876080	it's messed up, it's enraging.
2876080	2879880	In Victor May's case, there were multiple videos in which the person revealed their
2879880	2884280	private parts and declared their age, out of the constant lingering fear that they were
2884280	2890400	somewhat obliged to this cretin, in case he went and found anyone else because he inadvertently
2890400	2894760	degraded people by holding his power over them, which basically made them feel like
2894760	2899760	they had to do these things to please him, and the continual self-reference to age shows
2899760	2902760	that this was where Austin's preferences lay.
2902760	2907880	Austin wasn't just targeting fans who happened to be 14, he was specifically targeting 14
2907880	2908880	year olds.
2908880	2915800	Which leads us to our next case, Victim B. Victim B is a lot like Victim A, 14, but Austin
2915800	2917200	wouldn't have you believe that.
2917200	2921920	He once again dances into the DMs, acting like it's an honour that this person has
2921920	2924260	been blessed by his presence.
2924260	2927520	He really shouldn't be doing this, you know, the Vagabond.
2927520	2931600	Jones tells her how lucky she is, she says how much of a fan she is.
2931600	2935040	Jones tells her that she'll have to keep proving she's his biggest fan if he wants
2935040	2939520	to win the Austin Jones lottery and have a chance of sucking his dick.
2939520	2944040	Apparently sucking dick is correlated to being a fan of people, I'm a fan of a lot of people
2944040	2945040	then.
2945040	2948700	And this usual stick ensued, she didn't want to do it, Jones called into question
2948700	2954040	her official status as his biggest fan, and used it as blackmail into making this mind
2954040	2958720	objectify themselves and perform acts to satisfy the rocket in his pocket.
2958720	2962320	And that's what's most uncomfortable, it's how he continues to speak to her in
2962320	2967600	this juvenile way, acknowledging she's a child, through this condescending tone, go
2967600	2974080	on, you can do it, shake that ass, wow, you get 10 gold stars, that's so funny and wacky.
2974080	2978600	You can see it all here, I'll link it in the pinned comment if you're still interested.
2978600	2984400	Jones continuously pressures this person because he can't see their anus, and I feel unclean
2984400	2986020	just saying that.
2986020	2991940	The continuous cycle, and I mean some of the quotes speak for themselves, apparently that's
2991940	2995500	a sign of caring now, how lucky she is.
2995500	3000580	And the further reports just speak for themselves, it is legitimately repulsive, and it's quite
3000580	3006940	sensational that someone would really squander all that talent for a few predatory kicks.
3006940	3011520	And let's be clear, Austin Jones positioned himself in a place where he could do this,
3011520	3015540	but it's clear it comes from a place where he lacks self control, because no one with
3015580	3020300	any level of restraint, regardless of their twisted desires, throws away an unbelievably
3020300	3022460	successful career for jail time.
3022460	3026900	He clearly had the worst combination of determination and arrogance.
3026900	3031220	He's not necessarily stupid, he's clearly good at manipulating his environments in the
3031220	3036060	moment, but he clearly values the protection that his industry provides far too much as
3036060	3040740	this sort of get out of jail free card, but when you turn into a liability, they'll be
3040740	3042980	the first ones to throw you under the bus.
3042980	3046980	And honestly, I wouldn't mind the bus reversing back over you after what you've done to
3046980	3047980	these poor people.
3047980	3053500	And it should have been clear that he couldn't control himself after the run of exposed content.
3053500	3057340	When I first heard about this incident, I thought to myself, what an absolute tool.
3057340	3061820	Imagine having all of that influence and pursuing 14 year olds, but it should be clear that
3061820	3066300	their age was part of the appeal, and he thought his power could negate anything that came
3066300	3067300	his way.
3067300	3072020	Fortunately, it didn't, and justice has finally been served, it's hard to look into
3072060	3076660	a person's mind and understand exactly what they were thinking during the incident, however
3076660	3081660	Jones' borderline sociopathic exploitation of power should say more than enough about
3081660	3083620	the sentencing that he deserves.
3083620	3089260	This was cold, cruel, and calculated, and he needs to take a nice long trip to the slammer,
3089260	3096220	and with that in mind, I would like to wrap this all up finally.
3096220	3099420	Some people have to go, and Austin Jones was one of them.
3099420	3104860	He had proved himself not capable of handling power, and people even gave him a second chance,
3104860	3107980	whether they actually knew it or not, and he threw it away.
3107980	3112720	He was a nasty person who had dangerous desires, and clearly chose not to control them.
3112720	3116660	And second time around, he couldn't hide behind the quote hard times argument, he knew
3116660	3121140	what he was doing, he may be an idiot in some ways, but it's clearly not a Jekyll and Hyde
3121140	3122140	situation.
3122140	3126660	Eventually YouTube did remove his channel, at first they declined to do it, saying that
3126660	3131220	it wasn't attached to the instance enough, and although I do feel strongly in some instances
3131220	3135340	about separating the art from the artist, and I want to make it clear that I don't
3135340	3139340	think some criminals having YouTube channels is inherently destructive, and in fact, I'm
3139340	3143620	sure YouTube has helped some people move away from certain dangerous activities, but the
3143620	3149100	problem here is that his crimes are inextricably linked to the power that he has obtained through
3149100	3154060	YouTube, and if his sentence is shorter than we expect it to be for any reason, and he
3154060	3157380	comes back to YouTube, he can't have that opportunity.
3157380	3161780	Much of the footage I have found today can be found elsewhere, if you've found unique
3161780	3166860	enjoyment in his music, I can't take that away from you, I'd be a hypocrite if I tried
3166860	3171260	to, there are plenty of bad people who've made songs that I have an emotional connection
3171260	3176180	to and people could never take away from me, but at the same time, as talented as he is,
3176180	3180940	I feel that he has proven himself not capable of personally handling that power, so it's
3180940	3185660	quite clear that he doesn't deserve his channel, nor his fanbase, nor anything associated
3185660	3186660	with it.
3186660	3190420	Hopefully his sentence will prevent that, but you can never make any guarantees.
3190420	3194300	And that's the thing with talented people, even if they do provide something that might
3194300	3199160	be considered irreplaceable in some aspects, it certainly doesn't overshadow the lives
3199160	3203500	they could ruin through their rather selfish actions, and that's one of the most disheartening
3203500	3207860	things about the industry, especially with regards to music, he'd done this terrible
3207860	3212560	thing and people welcomed him back, they looked at the evidence, the 2015 evidence,
3212560	3216420	they looked at it in the eye, and they were like, this is fine, I have no doubt that many
3216420	3220940	people were aware of his behaviour, but because they received some sort of benefit from his
3220940	3225900	presence, they decided that actually, it wasn't worth addressing, much more just easy to sweep
3225900	3227040	under the carpet.
3227040	3231340	On top of this, this led to people who actually called it out, being attacked and threatened
3231340	3235920	by individuals who clearly had a stake in Austin's success, alienating themselves
3235920	3240020	from the victims, and denying the severity of the scenarios themselves.
3240020	3243720	By telling them that he had chosen them to speak to out of everyone, and making them
3243720	3248780	feel quote special, Jones tended to make people feel like their incident with him was isolated,
3248780	3253160	and therefore many people would maybe dismiss it as him having a funny 5 minutes, or feel
3253160	3258120	reluctant to come forward as a sole witness to what he was doing, and this is why it initially
3258120	3263540	took so long to corroborate accounts, and actively took another person with actual respect
3263540	3268700	from the community to come forward, and even then he was doubted and attacked by an industry
3268700	3273300	that wanted to forgive someone who should have known better, and even if he was sorry,
3273300	3277080	he shouldn't have been doing any tours and meet and greets with minors at all.
3277080	3281580	It was unbelievable how many people felt it appropriate to place someone who quite clearly
3281580	3286260	had an instinctive attraction to a certain demographic in control of members of that
3286260	3287260	demographic.
3287260	3291220	It would be like hiring a nonce as a babysitter, it doesn't matter if they're repentant,
3291220	3295060	you still shouldn't actively leave them in the vicinity of something that activates
3295060	3296060	their instincts.
3296060	3300740	A high majority of young people are vulnerable, whether they're 4 or 14, because they haven't
3300740	3302380	reached the peak of decision making.
3302380	3306340	I'm far from the person I was when I was 14, and I'm thankful that I wasn't really
3306340	3311080	invested in the internet the same way I am today, because honestly I'm not quite sure
3311080	3312780	how I would have coped with it.
3312780	3317060	It's hard to put these sorts of crimes on the spectrum, because anything involving exploitation
3317060	3322180	of minors is absolutely horrific, but as the listing of such photos goes, this is definitely
3322180	3327620	one of the worst cases, predominantly because he completely wages that power in an absolutely
3327620	3331720	obscene manner, readily ruining these people's lives for a quick kick.
3331720	3336140	You have to make sure that you do not become attached to people like Austin Jones, however
3336140	3340640	unlike the Bud-day, Austin Jones could be considered attractive in some fashions, and
3340640	3345340	on top of the fact that he was also talented, this gave him immense power over his fans.
3345340	3349860	As fans, it's so important to realise that having your own identity is more important
3349860	3352900	than mindlessly indoctrinating yourself in an idol.
3352900	3354820	Am I saying that you shouldn't have idols?
3354820	3359260	Of course not, feel free to go and love whoever you want to love, especially if it's me.
3359260	3363700	What I'm saying is that you have to be critical, and that's dangerous when you look at some
3363700	3368340	of these stans, they would give up their organs for some of the people they support, and when
3368340	3373660	you tie yourself to something so unconditionally, you open yourself up to exploitation, because
3373660	3376960	they know they can do anything and you'll remain loyal.
3376960	3381860	It's always about being able to take a step back and calling them out, about being able
3381860	3385720	to see someone like Austin's actions for what they are.
3385720	3390660	Eventually people did see it in Austin's case, and thanks to social media and actual records,
3390660	3394700	people managed to properly bring these cases forward, and hopefully it won't be too long
3394700	3398740	until he's serving some real jail time and isn't a danger to anyone else.
3398740	3402300	Unfortunately, this could and should have been dealt with earlier, and there are people
3402300	3403860	who are responsible for that.
3403860	3409080	The story of Austin Jones is a story of manipulation in many ways, I want to make it abundantly
3409080	3413780	clear that a lot of the techniques that he used in his videos are the exact same techniques
3413780	3417540	that might be used by people with genuine intent to convey a message.
3417540	3421700	There are many people who sit down and explain their actions in an honest manner, however
3421700	3426220	in the context of the situation, it becomes quite clear that what he said was not the
3426220	3430880	truth, and even if it was, he clearly consciously used it as an excuse rather than actually
3430880	3435260	believing it as a sincere retrospective analysis of his actions.
3435260	3440120	He doesn't have the capacity to be sincere, you have to pay close attention and extract
3440120	3444580	the facts in these situations, dealing with serious allegations here there isn't room
3444580	3449720	for leverage, and people should have identified that when the DMs originally surfaced, that
3449720	3454000	he was transparently taking advantage of people, suggesting that they weren't his biggest
3454000	3458520	fan for not twerking for them, that's not fun in games, people seem to overlook how
3458520	3462800	genuinely disgusting a lot of his language was, and how that should have indicated that
3462800	3468040	he was a nasty nasty cretin, even with what he was demanding, I hope he goes away for
3468040	3470200	a very long time.
3470200	3477140	It's clear that he has failed to learn from what he likes to call his mistakes.
3477140	3479280	What are your thoughts on the situation?
3479280	3484520	I would love to hear them in the comments section below, I have to give a massive huge
