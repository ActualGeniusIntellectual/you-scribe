00:00.000 --> 00:05.560
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:05.560 --> 00:10.580
too much free time, and today we're going to my favourite genre of all, music.

00:10.580 --> 00:14.280
Because your boy here, he loves the tunes, it's pretty much what I'm raised on.

00:14.280 --> 00:18.040
As I write this script, I'm actually currently listening to Mary's Prayer by Danny Wilson,

00:18.040 --> 00:21.880
wasn't sure about it at first, but I'll say, sophisticated pop songs do tend to grow

00:21.880 --> 00:22.880
on you.

00:22.880 --> 00:27.280
Unfortunately, today's topic won't be exactly focusing on my adoration for music, no, today

00:27.280 --> 00:31.640
we will be talking about a person called Austin Jones, who decided to take advantage

00:31.640 --> 00:34.560
of the clout given by such a blessed industry.

00:34.560 --> 00:38.920
However, to open this, I will at least be discussing some media related elements, because

00:38.920 --> 00:43.940
music is a unique industry for so many reasons, and it generates so much creative variety

00:43.940 --> 00:46.460
that is out there, particularly in the last few years.

00:46.460 --> 00:50.280
As the internet has become increasingly prevalent in the distribution of content, we've seen

00:50.280 --> 00:54.980
a real wave of music become popular that otherwise wouldn't ever have the chance.

00:54.980 --> 00:58.720
There is a lot of music that originates from YouTube, I've spoken about this before,

00:58.720 --> 01:03.820
but you have some teen boy, swooshed hair, bent over his acoustic guitar, staring into

01:03.820 --> 01:08.380
the camera, singing a sincere song about how much he wants to hold you, and suddenly their

01:08.380 --> 01:12.420
subscriber count explodes, regardless of how good the music actually is.

01:12.420 --> 01:16.500
But at the same time, you have to give credit to the musical achievements that YouTube has

01:16.500 --> 01:22.060
provided, from the early days of Chocolate Rain, to repopularising that weird trollolol

01:22.060 --> 01:23.060
song.

01:23.060 --> 01:28.020
We haven't seen such a wave of unique music since the early 1990s in many ways, it's

01:28.020 --> 01:32.440
just unlike then when we had music blasting onto the scene with great furor, the modern

01:32.440 --> 01:37.060
wave has been mostly downbeat, and mostly pretty depressing, and therefore it's never

01:37.060 --> 01:41.220
felt like a huge shock, more just like a musical cigarette.

01:41.220 --> 01:47.300
This is where we introduce the subject of today's video, Austin Jones, the blonde haired,

01:47.300 --> 01:49.940
blue eyed, dreamboat.

01:49.940 --> 01:54.500
But no, he's not just a pretty face, he's also a predator, and we're not just talking

01:54.500 --> 01:58.900
about allegations here, he's pleaded guilty in court, this is all fairly certain at this

01:58.900 --> 01:59.900
point.

01:59.900 --> 02:03.780
Austin Jones himself is a 26 year old musician, fresh out of Illinois.

02:03.780 --> 02:08.300
He wasn't the most identifiable of personalities, but he was clearly popular enough to amass

02:08.300 --> 02:13.380
well over 500,000 subscribers, we don't know the exact amount as his channel was terminated

02:13.380 --> 02:17.460
recently following his court case, but it was enough to make him matter.

02:17.460 --> 02:21.940
Predominately he was a musician who typically focused on covers, original music, and also

02:21.940 --> 02:26.820
acapellas, and making a fairly hefty career out of it, which we'll talk about later.

02:26.820 --> 02:32.220
However he also did certain videos that I assume were to create a bond with his audience,

02:32.220 --> 02:36.140
most of which are now unfortunately lost to the vaults of time, but nonetheless I think

02:36.140 --> 02:41.500
we can take the remains and put the pieces back together and create some sort of picture,

02:41.500 --> 02:44.500
and discuss that bond and how he exploited it.

02:44.540 --> 02:49.340
Austin started his career in 2007, and although it certainly took a while to gain traction,

02:49.340 --> 02:54.020
his continuous run of constant uploads and running off the popular genre paid its dues,

02:54.020 --> 02:56.160
and gradually his videos gained traction.

02:56.160 --> 03:01.160
This gave him more leverage to experiment with, and at some point he did these acapellas,

03:01.160 --> 03:05.600
which were what really bolstered his career, and eventually his content ended up amassing

03:05.600 --> 03:11.100
over 33 million views in total, alongside the sub count we discussed earlier.

03:11.100 --> 03:15.720
Much in lieu of my other video on the TikTok predator the budday, this video will be unpacking

03:15.720 --> 03:19.540
some of the build up, the abuse of power, and the subsequent moves he pulled out to

03:19.540 --> 03:24.620
evade backlash, and indeed pull an almost unbelievable turnaround after a situation

03:24.620 --> 03:28.700
that really could have finished his career, in fact the only thing that stopped him in

03:28.700 --> 03:31.140
the end was the heavy hand of the law.

03:31.140 --> 03:36.180
I remember when I first heard about this situation a couple years back in 2017, I wasn't making

03:36.180 --> 03:41.100
content that remotely resembled the work I was doing today, but either way, I dismissed

03:41.100 --> 03:42.100
him.

03:42.100 --> 03:45.700
You know, he's gonna get what he deserves, I'm thankful that actually he's not gonna

03:45.700 --> 03:50.620
be around, and to an extent that's true, he was a disgusting twat, but that was not the

03:50.620 --> 03:55.860
end of it, no, and now with these new developments, we're about to find out why, and investigate

03:55.860 --> 03:57.880
some deeper discussions beyond that.

03:57.880 --> 04:01.700
You see, although the attention on him has been widely pursued in the last two years,

04:01.700 --> 04:06.020
there have been people trying to bring attention to his behaviour since 2015.

04:06.020 --> 04:10.640
Many of these attempts to no avail at all, with the most being a non-apology in which

04:10.640 --> 04:15.580
Austin only demonstrates more of his manipulative tendencies, the years after were not just

04:15.580 --> 04:20.260
successful for Austin, they were his most successful, and that's what I find deeply

04:20.260 --> 04:25.860
troubling, and I think it's time we understand how exactly that happened, and how he loved

04:25.860 --> 04:27.980
to abuse his power.

04:27.980 --> 04:33.060
So without further ado, I suggest we pursue the curious case of Austin Jones.

04:57.980 --> 05:22.880
In many ways, what we see with Austin Jones is a classic ascension to power.

05:22.880 --> 05:27.880
He is the epitome of a teenage heartthrob, in that he represents the sort of lovely accessible

05:27.880 --> 05:31.540
idol who is there for you, who understands how you feel.

05:31.540 --> 05:35.320
Now unfortunately, or fortunately depending on your perspective, as his channel is no

05:35.320 --> 05:39.340
longer in existence, we have to take what little archive knowledge we can obtain, but

05:39.340 --> 05:44.380
I don't think it's too difficult to completely break down exactly why he found himself in

05:44.380 --> 05:45.900
a position of power.

05:45.900 --> 05:50.860
Firstly he was a YouTube OG, he set up his channel in 2007, he was allowed to excel on

05:50.860 --> 05:55.900
a platform with less competition, and he was also ahead of the curve in many aspects.

05:55.900 --> 06:00.820
YouTube exploded as a platform for actual professional musicians a few years after,

06:00.820 --> 06:03.380
and Austin Jones was already there putting up covers.

06:03.380 --> 06:07.960
Now his covers typically did well, appearing to exceed the number of views to the subscribers

06:07.960 --> 06:12.240
he had fairly impressively, but as we well know, typically making covers isn't the

06:12.240 --> 06:14.600
only way to hold on to the audience you have.

06:14.600 --> 06:20.120
But you see, Austin Jones had the looks, and he also had the eye contact, and he also had

06:20.120 --> 06:21.720
the choice for songs.

06:21.720 --> 06:22.720
What do I mean?

06:22.720 --> 06:28.180
But let's talk about One Direction, one of the most prolific boy bands of the 2010s.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.160
Why were they so successful?

06:30.160 --> 06:34.040
Well because of the young, impressionable teenage girls, but also because of how they

06:34.040 --> 06:35.200
marketed to them.

06:35.200 --> 06:39.060
Now one of the things that you become extremely aware of if you've listened to music in

06:39.060 --> 06:43.400
a critical fashion was what one would call the second person perspective.

06:43.400 --> 06:48.500
Second person perspective is focusing on the word you, it's a narrative perspective from

06:48.500 --> 06:53.140
your point of view, and One Direction mastered it.

06:53.140 --> 06:56.980
What makes you beautiful gotta be you.

06:56.980 --> 07:01.860
The list goes on, and on, and on, and the reason that shameless musical executives did

07:01.860 --> 07:06.540
this was because the vulnerable, insecure girl loves to be comforted by the cute, charming

07:06.540 --> 07:08.980
boy who just wants to make you feel wanted.

07:08.980 --> 07:11.180
Oh wait, that's a different twat.

07:11.180 --> 07:14.740
I do apologise, there are just so many of them, especially early 2010s.

07:14.740 --> 07:20.260
I do not know what we were on, but PG singles about how much boys love you was the in thing.

07:20.260 --> 07:24.780
Austin Jones definitely played into that rule, having that sort of song that was addressed

07:24.780 --> 07:29.280
to you, the listener, where he would tell you how valued or loved you are, he'd have

07:29.280 --> 07:33.940
this cheeky look at the camera, and all you bitches were expected to swoon appropriately.

07:33.940 --> 07:38.360
If anything's left, you can have a look at the comment sections on one of his very, very

07:38.360 --> 07:43.340
old videos, back in the day, and you get the comments that are completely won over.

07:43.340 --> 07:47.500
For another one of his videos, sake of falling in love, we can observe the comments.

08:13.340 --> 08:22.040
If anyone can guess those YouTubers who voice them, you get a gold star from me, the right opinion.

08:22.040 --> 08:23.920
Now that is just one page.

08:23.920 --> 08:28.940
Of course, not all of these comments are alluding to Austin's looks or his romantic capabilities,

08:28.940 --> 08:33.040
but they should show the sort of audience that he was appealing to at this point, the

08:33.040 --> 08:37.700
sort of emotional character who cries whenever a blonde boy breathes in their direction.

08:37.700 --> 08:42.260
He is very cleverly creating an audience that is vulnerable in of itself, and therefore

08:42.260 --> 08:45.160
he can use that to his advantage, and so he did.

08:45.160 --> 08:49.760
The sort of thing can be found on his Twitter, or what was his Twitter, because it's no longer there.

08:49.760 --> 08:54.480
Well, it is there, but it's someone who clearly hasn't taken advantage of the notion of a parody account.

08:54.480 --> 08:57.200
I mean, come on, you can be more creative than that.

08:57.200 --> 09:02.400
But anyhow, his Twitter was conducted of firstly putting out vague, sensual tweets that make

09:02.400 --> 09:06.240
the impressionable audience think, oh wow, this guy gets me.

09:06.240 --> 09:11.160
At the same time, a lot of these tweets tended to focus on his vulnerability, or how indebted

09:11.160 --> 09:14.220
he was to his fans, and this put him on their level.

09:14.220 --> 09:17.220
It makes him seem more relatable or warm to an extent.

09:17.220 --> 09:19.300
He owes you his life, guys.

09:19.300 --> 09:21.800
Wow, he would do anything for you people.

09:21.800 --> 09:25.060
He might not have made it this far if you hadn't bought his albums.

09:25.060 --> 09:28.800
At the same time it guilt trips people who haven't bought the album, it's a good double

09:28.800 --> 09:32.260
bind where he ends up favourably in either line of reasoning.

09:32.260 --> 09:37.380
The other types of tweets he did were those which heavily relied on the interactions with his fans.

09:37.440 --> 09:42.040
Now, there were even less examples of those, but I found one time where his page was archived

09:42.040 --> 09:47.820
in 2013, and a high majority of the tweets were what, judging from the format, I believe

09:47.820 --> 09:52.420
were quote tweets, in which he would regularly interact with his fans about their purchase

09:52.420 --> 09:56.820
or enjoyment of Jones' content, though I did find this excellent tweet that definitely

09:56.820 --> 10:01.800
shows a more flirtive side of Jones, which we are going to witness in a much more aggressive

10:01.800 --> 10:03.260
form very soon.

10:03.260 --> 10:04.700
For the new trace he writes,

10:09.700 --> 10:11.300
Austin quaintly replies with

10:14.900 --> 10:18.640
Now, to be frank, I don't really have a problem with comedic flirting, hell I do it all the

10:18.640 --> 10:22.780
time with my mates, but at the same time, this is foreshadowing irony that this girl

10:22.780 --> 10:24.540
clearly isn't aware of.

10:24.540 --> 10:29.580
It's all banter until you realise that there is actually a slightly deeper context.

10:29.580 --> 10:34.100
With his new power, Austin became quite aware of who he was appealing to, and one of the

10:34.100 --> 10:37.940
other techniques that became quite prominent in his later content was the use of other

10:37.940 --> 10:42.420
sizeable fanbases, typically if you have topics that are relating to someone with more of

10:42.420 --> 10:46.660
a cult following, your sort of tribute to them will spill over into an appeal, so for

10:46.660 --> 10:52.100
example if someone did an Ariana Grande or BTS acapella, they'd probably do very well,

10:52.100 --> 10:55.100
although I doubt they'd make much money because it would be claimed.

10:55.140 --> 10:59.760
And so Austin goes for the stans who are either gonna want to send you their heart or want

10:59.760 --> 11:03.900
to eat yours out depending on how well you execute your behaviour, and this brings us

11:03.900 --> 11:08.720
to the final positive but equally depressing point about Austin's appeal.

11:08.720 --> 11:13.140
He was actually talented, terrible people can be incredibly talented, and although Austin's

11:13.140 --> 11:18.040
music and covers themselves weren't indicative of anyone with exceptional flair, his acapella

11:18.040 --> 11:22.340
covers definitely were, and I'm not gonna play them here because fair use on YouTube

11:22.340 --> 11:26.200
is in ruins right now, but I'll leave a link to an archived version, and what he does is

11:26.200 --> 11:31.460
quite exceptional, and it would require an incredible amount of concentration and perseverance,

11:31.460 --> 11:35.840
there were very few people who could consistently layer themselves doing covers in such a tight

11:35.840 --> 11:39.220
fashion and then do it again, and again, and again.

11:39.220 --> 11:43.960
He was creating a brand for himself out of what is now quite a fairly exhausted genre.

11:43.960 --> 11:48.820
With success comes power, and with power comes, well, let's find out.

11:52.340 --> 12:00.580
Manipulation is the word of the day to day chaps, because what Austin Jones did on YouTube

12:00.580 --> 12:04.720
was textbook manipulation of the algorithms to obtain success.

12:04.720 --> 12:08.960
Now that is the story of the success of many YouTubers, you observe the trends, you work

12:08.960 --> 12:13.900
out how you benefit off of it, and then you embark on the journey to become a successful

12:13.900 --> 12:14.900
YouTuber.

12:14.900 --> 12:18.280
In the case of Austin Jones, he worked out the audience that he wanted to obtain and

12:18.280 --> 12:19.880
subsequently obtained them.

12:19.880 --> 12:25.800
The year is 2015, although not as big as he would be, Austin Jones has successfully manipulated

12:25.800 --> 12:28.920
the algorithms into a position of power.

12:28.920 --> 12:33.480
However, as foreshadowed, there is a lot more to the story than just the manipulations of

12:33.480 --> 12:34.480
the algorithms.

12:34.480 --> 12:38.200
When you have an idol who is successful like Austin Jones, and you know he's out there

12:38.200 --> 12:42.920
being so interactive, it makes you think, oh yeah, I've got this chance with this guy,

12:42.920 --> 12:47.080
there's this clip of him at a One Direction slash 5 seconds of summer concert, he's being

12:47.080 --> 13:05.320
thrown out, and all these girls are screaming his name, oh my god, it's Austin Jones!

13:05.320 --> 13:10.540
He is absolutely reveling in this, and when he builds that relationship, he can then slide

13:10.540 --> 13:17.480
into the DMs, and once he gets there, he plays off this sort of good cop, bad cop dynamic.

13:17.480 --> 13:21.660
One side of him is incredibly grateful, so lovely and humble, and the other side of him

13:21.660 --> 13:26.380
is more primitive, aggressive and dominative, and what he does is in these confrontations

13:26.380 --> 13:31.340
he tends to mesh these two personas together fairly deftly to try and coerce what he wants

13:31.340 --> 13:32.340
from people.

13:32.340 --> 13:36.520
So we're gonna go trawling through this content, and identifying the various techniques he's

13:36.520 --> 13:37.520
pulled off.

13:37.520 --> 13:40.300
Now there are a load of examples of these, and to go through all of them, well we'd end

13:40.300 --> 13:45.840
up going round in circles, so I want to take one example, this one, a series of texts I

13:45.840 --> 13:50.320
found posted by Lauren Miller, I don't know if these are her own, but we can break it

13:50.320 --> 13:54.420
down fairly comprehensively in the meantime, and I want you to put yourself in the shoes

13:54.420 --> 13:59.140
of the adoring fangirl who is finally having the honour of speaking to their idol, who

13:59.140 --> 14:04.780
has already solicited some form of imagery as shown in the text, and yet still wants

14:04.780 --> 14:05.780
more.

14:05.780 --> 14:11.320
What we see here in this message is the breaking of tone in the conversation, or well, supposed.

14:11.320 --> 14:15.960
By saying let me be honest here, it implies that now he's going to be more sincere than

14:15.960 --> 14:16.960
he has before.

14:16.960 --> 14:22.540
Then he says, I'm having a really down night, this puts him in a position of vulnerability.

14:22.540 --> 14:26.740
We already know he's tweeting about coping with depression, so in this he is using that

14:26.740 --> 14:30.560
mental illness to place him in a position requiring support.

14:30.560 --> 14:31.880
What is that support?

14:31.880 --> 14:36.680
Well I think I know, but not satisfied with just that, he then puts the fan in a position

14:36.680 --> 14:37.960
of exclusivity.

14:37.960 --> 14:42.860
You see he's only chosen to talk to her, how blessed she should be that this huge public

14:42.860 --> 14:45.860
figure has gone out of his way for her.

14:45.860 --> 14:50.440
So what you have so far is multiple tactics used in the space of a few sentences, you

14:50.440 --> 14:54.140
have sincerity, vulnerability, and exclusivity.

14:54.140 --> 14:58.720
This pushes pressure onto someone who is probably already desperate to impress their idol, a

14:58.720 --> 15:03.200
person who is also rather young, and probably rather impressionable, and then with all this

15:03.200 --> 15:05.660
in mind, he goes in with a request.

15:05.660 --> 15:09.600
And I'm pretty impressed that the girl in this instance said no to him.

15:09.600 --> 15:14.160
Now for some people, no means no, but for Austin, no means the yes that hasn't quite

15:14.160 --> 15:15.360
been said yet.

15:15.360 --> 15:19.560
He presses again, and then the girl rejects again, and once again the girl replies very

15:19.560 --> 15:20.560
responsibly.

15:20.560 --> 15:25.140
At this point, even though this lass has spelled out the exact reasons why she doesn't want

15:25.140 --> 15:31.180
to hand over any more content to this predatory creature, he acts confused, he doesn't understand,

15:31.180 --> 15:35.580
pretty much trying to mentally exhaust the person, continuously asking the person to

15:35.580 --> 15:37.180
justify their reasoning.

15:37.180 --> 15:41.600
Now explanations in these instances are being built on premises, and what Austin here is

15:41.600 --> 15:46.640
trying to do is reach the premises so he can perhaps invalidate them and thus invalidate

15:46.640 --> 15:51.040
their reasoning, thus guilt tripping them into providing him with more content.

15:51.040 --> 15:53.140
And she doesn't crack, which fair play.

15:53.140 --> 15:58.020
She points out the age gap, he dismisses these 3 points as casually and says, oh guys,

15:58.020 --> 16:00.700
this is just for fun, yes, great banter.

16:00.700 --> 16:04.660
He then asks if he can offer something in return, and the girl justifiably says that

16:04.660 --> 16:08.560
the fact that he is messaging her is more than enough, and I think what should be quite

16:08.560 --> 16:13.300
clear now is that this girl is in a vulnerable position, to the point where she still clearly

16:13.300 --> 16:18.980
idolises him in spite of these highly uncomfortable advances, and instead of taking a step back

16:18.980 --> 16:24.420
and being able to humanise the situation, Austin Jones pushes on to achieve his only

16:24.420 --> 16:25.420
goal.

16:25.420 --> 16:29.260
It's the messages after that become a vault to his ever stranger mind.

16:29.260 --> 16:33.380
After the girl said that talking to him is an honour, he takes this as a chance to once

16:33.380 --> 16:39.240
again hold his power over her, he brags, he receives thousands of messages, loads of people

16:39.240 --> 16:44.340
out there wanting to talk to this world famous Austin Jones, and yet he is talking to her

16:44.340 --> 16:45.780
out of everyone.

16:45.780 --> 16:52.040
What he is trying to do right now is alienate the person from these objections of inappropriateness.

16:52.040 --> 16:56.400
This person has raised the point that she is 14, but Austin isn't targeting her because

16:56.400 --> 17:01.360
she's 14, he's targeting her because he was just randomly scrolling through and has decided

17:01.360 --> 17:07.440
that the lucky winner of the Austin Jones luxury lewd lotto will be this lovely lass.

17:07.440 --> 17:09.020
He just wants to talk to her.

17:09.020 --> 17:10.020
Age?

17:10.020 --> 17:11.020
What?

17:11.020 --> 17:12.020
What's age?

17:12.540 --> 17:14.140
Some silly concept?

17:14.140 --> 17:16.060
Who cares about age?

17:16.060 --> 17:20.100
At the same time he implicitly degrades the person he's talking to, despite the fact

17:20.100 --> 17:25.240
that he promoted that exclusivity earlier, it was tainted with a tone of disposability.

17:25.240 --> 17:29.520
There are thousands of people just like her, and he can just scroll to another DM and find

17:29.520 --> 17:33.460
another fangirl who will give him what he needs so desperately.

17:33.460 --> 17:36.740
Through this he creates a contradiction, on one hand he claims that he can go and get

17:36.740 --> 17:41.060
this content from any of his other fans, but at the same time he is clearly driven to obtain

17:41.100 --> 17:45.500
it from this one fangirl, or else he would've just given up on the first try.

17:45.500 --> 17:49.380
Maybe that's because he can't obtain content like that from anywhere else, or maybe that's

17:49.380 --> 17:53.560
because he just wants to get his way, given the fact that he did solicit content from

17:53.560 --> 17:56.860
other people in the same boat, it might well be both.

17:56.860 --> 18:01.740
I think he clearly has some kind of twisted desire to take advantage of this power dynamic

18:01.740 --> 18:06.100
that he holds, and fair play to that girl for being able to turn him down, because many

18:06.100 --> 18:08.060
people didn't.

18:08.060 --> 18:12.420
Austin is clearly Austin's middle name, and you can see this in the final few DMs

18:12.420 --> 18:13.420
that have been published.

18:13.420 --> 18:18.300
The girl asks him, appealing to him on the grounds of human decency, saying that would

18:18.300 --> 18:23.100
you do something that you're not comfortable with, aware that a fan is presenting her perspective,

18:23.100 --> 18:27.780
he turns around and says, well yes actually if I wanted to make them happy, thus once

18:27.780 --> 18:32.700
again undermining her reasoning, blatantly deceptive, and extremely malicious.

18:32.700 --> 18:36.860
Oh and look, he'll twerk too now, how charitable.

18:36.860 --> 18:42.120
Basically what you see here is Jones completely taking advantage of that fan admiration, singling

18:42.120 --> 18:46.420
them out in conversation, using that power to intimidate them, and then using various

18:46.420 --> 18:50.020
mental techniques to try and coerce what he wants out of them.

18:50.020 --> 18:54.420
He's having a hard time, he really needs those twerking videos guys, he needs them to get

18:54.420 --> 18:55.580
through the night.

18:55.580 --> 19:00.820
My heart weeps for this poor soul who may never have the twerking videos he needs so

19:00.820 --> 19:01.820
desperately.

19:01.820 --> 19:07.540
Now, I can't guarantee these DMs are real, but I present the evidence today under the

19:07.540 --> 19:12.220
fact that judging by the conviction and the way his language corroborates in various other

19:12.220 --> 19:15.820
DMs, that this is extremely, extremely credible.

19:15.820 --> 19:16.820
What other DMs?

19:16.820 --> 19:20.860
Well there's this one where he was giving another person the exclusive treatment, he

19:20.860 --> 19:25.820
wanted to get to know the person through the medium of twerking, and then she says no.

19:25.820 --> 19:31.180
Back and forth, same old shtick, he says obviously you don't want to make me happy, which will

19:31.180 --> 19:35.900
obviously cut to the heart of the insecure fan, because having someone pass judgement

19:35.900 --> 19:39.120
on your intentions can feel extremely harmful.

19:39.120 --> 19:44.180
So once again he pretty much tries any manipulation tactic under the sun, and I wanted to finish

19:44.180 --> 19:49.540
this part on this one clip, just so people know what we were dealing with here.

19:49.540 --> 19:59.300
It's just cuz, it's for the benefit of both of us, cuz like, I'm horny like all the time,

19:59.300 --> 20:05.300
so if we just keep talking, I'm probably gonna ask for videos on like a daily basis, and

20:05.300 --> 20:08.300
then I'm gonna feel like a dick, and then you guys are gonna reject me and I'm just

20:08.300 --> 20:12.300
gonna feel like shit so, it's just like easier this way.

20:12.300 --> 20:18.700
Yeah sorry I'm a guy, but I still love you.

20:18.700 --> 20:24.980
Yes, so so classy, and like any situation, he was called out, and as it started spreading

20:24.980 --> 20:29.540
he started begging all these people in the DMs, oh please don't do this to me, and as

20:29.540 --> 20:34.420
the uproar spread and people got more angered and his fans were turning to him and saying

20:34.420 --> 20:40.420
Austin what is going on, he decided that he was going to do one thing, and that was set

20:40.420 --> 20:48.180
the record straight.

20:48.180 --> 20:52.180
Austin Jones is face down with all these very serious situations, he's being hit

20:52.180 --> 20:57.820
on all sides, and at the end of June 2015, he decided to do the very smart thing and

20:57.820 --> 21:06.340
post a video response, no not that one, that's too honest to be his quote official response,

21:06.340 --> 21:10.820
no we're going to be talking about this one, namely setting the record straight.

21:10.820 --> 21:14.580
Now there's a lot to say about this video, and I'll try and cover it all without being

21:14.580 --> 21:19.860
caught up in the two minor things, but once again, what you witness is success and manipulating

21:19.860 --> 21:22.500
a situation that really he had no right to.

21:22.500 --> 21:27.620
Now it's fair to say that now the video has received overwhelmingly negative feedback,

21:27.620 --> 21:31.860
many people from all over communities banded together to make sure he was shown up, but

21:31.860 --> 21:36.780
at the same time, looking at the old ratings, he was doing alright, and Austin wasn't

21:36.780 --> 21:40.660
really appealing to any of the people who actually care about internet affairs, but

21:40.660 --> 21:44.440
more to his loyals who were going to stick around no matter what, and judging by some

21:44.440 --> 21:47.580
statistics that we'll see later, it might just have worked.

21:47.580 --> 21:51.820
So let's talk about how Austin Jones set the record straight.

21:51.820 --> 21:55.620
He's in this situation, he's up against the wall, he has to hold on to the fans that

21:55.620 --> 22:00.340
he has, and he has the main platform to do it, he knows what he's done, it's pretty

22:00.340 --> 22:04.100
terrible, and regardless of the delivery, he's gonna come under some fire, so what

22:04.100 --> 22:08.980
he firstly does here is present himself as the reasonable mediator, and I want to play

22:08.980 --> 22:13.780
you this opening clip, because there is so many techniques you can break down in it alone.

22:38.980 --> 22:46.220
You see lads, here he plays a very two sided card, on one hand, he completely understands

22:46.220 --> 22:50.980
that people hate him, and have those negative opinions, and all he's asking to do is to

22:50.980 --> 22:56.220
hear him out, but in his delivery, you'll be able to break down some very slight techniques,

22:56.220 --> 23:00.380
firstly he implies that people will be receiving the truth from this video, when of course,

23:00.380 --> 23:03.480
when there is only one truth and no one is ever going to see the complete truth, there

23:03.480 --> 23:07.820
are just testimonies, the closest you're going to get to the truth are the screenshots,

23:07.820 --> 23:10.460
and yeah, you're not going to be bringing them out are you?

23:10.460 --> 23:15.460
Another great word he uses is the word mistakes, because although it's an admission of misconduct,

23:15.460 --> 23:20.580
mistake is a rather forgiving word, as it implies the person was not acting with necessarily

23:20.580 --> 23:25.380
ill intent when they behaved in such a way, so already although he hasn't actually said

23:25.380 --> 23:30.500
anything of substance to respond to the criticism, he has already used a few rhetorical devices

23:30.500 --> 23:33.860
to elicit sympathy from his more easily influenced viewers.

23:33.860 --> 23:35.900
I now want to play you this excerpt.

24:03.860 --> 24:14.260
Here we can see a similar mechanism, he apologises but simultaneously downplays his crime so

24:14.260 --> 24:15.900
people are more forgiving.

24:15.900 --> 24:20.020
He asked his fans for twerking videos, you know twerking, the dance moves, like the floss

24:20.020 --> 24:21.620
or the Macarena.

24:21.620 --> 24:25.260
He obviously fails to mention that many of these fans were underage, and the additional

24:25.260 --> 24:29.480
details that we've indulged ourselves with, and we will indulge ourselves with later on,

24:29.480 --> 24:31.720
but there is still more in this segment.

24:31.720 --> 24:35.400
So he speaks about the YouTuber who has brought this to people's attention, I assume he's

24:35.400 --> 24:39.900
referring to D Fizzy or Damon Fizzy who was one of the few people to actually call him

24:39.900 --> 24:45.680
out in 2015, but he's not going to name names, how courteous of him, because he knows what

24:45.680 --> 24:50.000
it's like to have been mercilessly attacked and he doesn't want to do that, but in this

24:50.000 --> 24:54.880
instance this isn't a courtesy, this is a tactic to make sure people aren't seeing any

24:54.880 --> 24:59.320
other perspectives and do not know where they are coming from, bar his own, which is also

24:59.320 --> 25:01.680
why he has comments turned off.

25:01.680 --> 25:06.320
Also notice how he uses aggressive verbs when he describes how these people have dealt with

25:06.320 --> 25:11.800
him, they've blasted it out there, it makes the people he's talking about sound more instigatory.

25:11.800 --> 25:15.920
We've seen a lot of drama where people have felt the need to play the victim, Austin isn't

25:15.920 --> 25:20.540
doing that exactly, but he is implicitly leading people who may be sympathetic of his cause

25:20.540 --> 25:22.500
to that exact conclusion.

25:22.500 --> 25:27.360
All these people going after poor Austin for his old mistakes and he's learned from them,

25:27.360 --> 25:31.640
he's ashamed, and now they're just blasting it out on the internet.

25:31.640 --> 25:37.360
Since this started online, there are a lot of rumours and a lot of lies, they're just

25:37.360 --> 25:40.620
not true, nothing ever went further.

25:40.620 --> 25:44.600
Now this is a blatant lie, but also one that he could get away with at the time, because

25:44.600 --> 25:49.480
at that point the evidence hadn't been widespread and affirmative enough to lead people to different

25:49.480 --> 25:53.840
conclusions, so this allowed him to hold that narrative, which although on one side felt

25:53.840 --> 25:58.200
like he was admitting something, it wasn't like he could deny it, so it wasn't exactly

25:58.200 --> 25:59.760
reasonable on his behalf.

25:59.760 --> 26:04.000
There's a load more in between, talking about how he was on tour, how this hit him,

26:04.000 --> 26:07.880
and then he plays a victim card, but not in the way that you'd expect.

26:07.880 --> 26:14.480
A lot of people ask, why did the initial statement take so long to get up?

26:14.480 --> 26:20.700
I put up a text statement and apology addressing the situation, but it took me about a week

26:20.700 --> 26:23.680
to do so.

26:23.680 --> 26:27.600
People thought that I was being a coward, people thought that I didn't want to confront

26:27.600 --> 26:33.440
the situation, they thought that I was just blowing it off, that's not true.

26:33.440 --> 26:36.240
As I said, I was on the road, I was on tour.

26:36.240 --> 26:41.440
We were all the way in Boston, so we had to make the drive all the way back from Boston

26:41.440 --> 26:42.440
to Chicago.

26:42.440 --> 26:49.160
On that drive, the only thing I did was look at my phone and look at all the hate and death

26:49.160 --> 26:51.280
threats.

26:51.280 --> 26:52.600
I got lost in it.

26:52.600 --> 26:57.980
I would read every little comment, every little person telling me to kill myself, every person

26:57.980 --> 27:02.720
telling me that life wasn't worth living for me anymore.

27:02.720 --> 27:09.760
And I'm a pretty insecure person, to where negative comments like that really impact

27:09.760 --> 27:10.760
me.

27:10.760 --> 27:15.600
It's not something I can just brush off.

27:15.600 --> 27:22.760
That entire ride home, I read those comments and I began researching different suicide

27:22.760 --> 27:23.760
methods.

27:23.760 --> 27:27.340
When we got back, I didn't even step foot in my house.

27:27.340 --> 27:35.000
My family took me immediately to the hospital and I was hospitalized for my suicidal tendencies.

27:35.000 --> 27:40.660
So no, I wasn't cowering, I wasn't avoiding the situation.

27:40.660 --> 27:44.360
I was in a hospital.

27:44.360 --> 27:49.800
I had no internet connection, I had no connection to social media, so I couldn't put out a

27:49.800 --> 27:50.800
statement.

27:50.800 --> 27:51.800
I wanted to.

27:51.800 --> 27:52.800
I wanted to apologize.

27:52.800 --> 27:58.320
I wanted to confront it immediately, but I couldn't.

27:58.320 --> 28:02.700
As soon as I got out of the hospital, the next day, that's when I put it up.

28:02.700 --> 28:07.040
So that's why the initial statement took so long to get out.

28:07.040 --> 28:12.080
And this is the thing, in some respects, it's a really obvious victim card to the critical

28:12.080 --> 28:13.080
audience.

28:13.080 --> 28:18.240
What he's done here is he's smartly played the point as proxy to the not so critical

28:18.240 --> 28:19.240
viewer.

28:19.240 --> 28:23.360
You see, if we respond to criticism by pointing out the hate we've received, we are often

28:23.360 --> 28:27.580
called out for changing the conversation and not confronting the criticism.

28:27.580 --> 28:33.320
In this scenario, however, Austin has used the hate he received as a direct response

28:33.320 --> 28:34.320
to the criticism.

28:34.320 --> 28:39.120
He couldn't do something because of the hate he received, which is still somewhat

28:39.120 --> 28:43.200
awkward as an argument, but not as much as it could have been, and serves as a way to

28:43.200 --> 28:48.000
convey his victimhood without being a necessarily invalid response.

28:48.000 --> 28:52.440
The video is meant to be a response to a lot of the criticism he's received, and it does

28:52.440 --> 28:57.560
do that in a way, but it constantly detours down the road of the hard times that he's

28:57.560 --> 28:59.020
having as a response.

28:59.020 --> 29:03.080
This can be particularly found in the extended anecdote throughout the final part of his

29:03.080 --> 29:07.400
video where he talks about his life and the struggles that he's experienced, and how

29:07.400 --> 29:11.960
that created the mindset that led him to do these fun and goofy things.

29:11.960 --> 29:16.520
The biggest question I get asked is why?

29:16.520 --> 29:18.760
Why did this happen?

29:18.760 --> 29:21.760
Why did I ask for those things?

29:21.760 --> 29:27.760
So in order to figure out why, you have to look at the reasons, and the reasons lie in

29:27.760 --> 29:34.540
my past, and in what I've experienced through life, and how I even got to that point.

29:34.540 --> 29:40.160
I experienced death and loss at a very young age.

29:40.160 --> 29:42.160
I had an older sister.

29:42.160 --> 29:44.620
She passed away when she was ten years old.

29:44.620 --> 29:47.100
I was six years old at the time.

29:47.100 --> 29:52.360
I went through a series of funerals when I was very young.

29:52.360 --> 29:57.780
Most were distant relatives that I either didn't even know at all, or I had only seen

29:57.780 --> 30:02.140
on a few occasions, but I was so young that I really didn't know who they were.

30:02.140 --> 30:06.780
I barely saw my father.

30:06.780 --> 30:12.180
My parents divorced at a very, very young age, and the last time I saw him was when

30:12.180 --> 30:14.500
I was eight years old.

30:14.500 --> 30:20.780
My father was an alcoholic and a drug addict, and he couldn't get control of his life because

30:20.780 --> 30:21.780
of it.

30:21.780 --> 30:26.900
When I was sixteen, a few months before he passed away, my family and I, we went through

30:26.900 --> 30:28.220
a house fire.

30:28.220 --> 30:33.380
We were away visiting relatives, and somebody broke into our house, stole some things, and

30:33.380 --> 30:35.340
burned the entire house down.

30:35.340 --> 30:40.180
About a month after my father passed away, my grandfather passed away, and I was very

30:40.180 --> 30:41.980
close to my grandfather.

30:41.980 --> 30:46.680
After that happened, that's when I began self-harming.

30:46.680 --> 30:51.620
I used to cut my wrists, and I'm over three years clean of that now.

30:51.620 --> 31:05.300
All of these life events, all of these deaths, this loss left me with really deep, deep depression.

31:05.300 --> 31:14.180
I was an insecure, depressed guy, and I began searching for attention in the wrong ways,

31:14.180 --> 31:18.620
asking fans for those things.

31:18.620 --> 31:20.940
It was because I was desperate for attention.

31:20.980 --> 31:23.780
I was desperate for reassurance.

31:23.780 --> 31:26.380
I wanted to feel good about myself.

31:26.380 --> 31:29.880
At the time, I thought it was just fun and goofy.

31:29.880 --> 31:33.340
Like I said, doesn't excuse my actions, doesn't justify it.

31:33.340 --> 31:35.280
That's not why I told you all of that.

31:35.280 --> 31:41.440
I told you it so that you would understand why I was that desperate, why I was even asking

31:41.440 --> 31:42.580
for those things.

31:42.580 --> 31:47.940
It was that depression piling up into me searching for attention.

31:47.940 --> 31:52.560
A lot of his evidence of his experiences are things that are completely impossible

31:52.560 --> 31:57.820
to verify, which although plausible, still inspires scepticism with the context of what

31:57.820 --> 31:59.660
we now know he has done.

31:59.660 --> 32:00.660
For example...

32:00.660 --> 32:06.700
So, something else that I want to talk about is people saying that you're only sorry that

32:06.700 --> 32:08.260
you got caught.

32:08.260 --> 32:11.100
You know, you apologise because you got caught.

32:11.100 --> 32:13.960
You don't actually feel sorry.

32:13.960 --> 32:16.020
That's so far from the truth.

32:16.020 --> 32:23.800
And there are a few actual examples that show that before I went on tour.

32:23.800 --> 32:29.020
And he presents these as quote actual examples, but they're impossible to completely prove

32:29.020 --> 32:33.900
and yet he presents them as the counter narrative that he clearly regrets what he did.

32:33.900 --> 32:38.500
Every single piece of evidence is circumstantial, but I guess that's good enough for some people.

32:38.500 --> 32:41.700
Finally, I want to bring your attention to this clip.

32:41.700 --> 32:49.060
On my last tour, a few months ago, I started going back to therapy for this specific reason.

32:49.060 --> 32:56.180
Because I regretted it so much and I couldn't move past it.

32:56.180 --> 32:57.540
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

32:57.540 --> 33:02.300
I couldn't stop feeling like absolute shit for what I had done.

33:02.300 --> 33:06.420
So I went back to therapy before I left for tour.

33:06.940 --> 33:13.740
Also, a few months before this became public, I talked to a couple of my coworkers, if you

33:13.740 --> 33:18.140
want to call them that, one of which is very popular online.

33:18.140 --> 33:22.860
If you're part of this specific music scene, you'd know exactly who he is if I told you

33:22.860 --> 33:23.860
who he was.

33:23.860 --> 33:29.060
So this is a pretty big and I'd like to consider reputable man.

33:29.060 --> 33:30.460
I went to him with this.

33:30.460 --> 33:33.740
I told him my entire past.

33:33.740 --> 33:39.100
I told him that I felt so guilty for this and that I regret it and that I wanted to

33:39.100 --> 33:41.620
confess all of this in the video.

33:41.620 --> 33:47.780
Come clean about it, just get it off my chest so I can stop living with the guilt and officially

33:47.780 --> 33:49.860
apologize to everybody.

33:49.860 --> 33:51.460
He told me not to.

33:51.460 --> 33:57.020
He told me that it would only hurt my career and what I did wasn't even that bad and that

33:57.020 --> 33:59.020
I should just not even think about it.

33:59.020 --> 34:00.220
I just shouldn't do it.

34:00.220 --> 34:04.320
Firstly, he goes the Donald Trump route of talking about how he spoke to a man who was

34:04.320 --> 34:05.420
very reputable.

34:05.420 --> 34:10.620
Of course, never naming any names, but he's appealing to his authority in this instance,

34:10.620 --> 34:15.380
and then he follows it with the fact that this very reputable person actually said demanding

34:15.380 --> 34:20.860
twerking videos from fans, that's not bad, and he leans on that authority to justify

34:20.860 --> 34:23.060
why he hasn't spoken about it.

34:23.060 --> 34:27.720
It's embarrassingly transparent, and it's a real shame that this actually worked.

34:27.720 --> 34:31.640
This screenshot is the one taken at the 2017 allegations.

34:31.640 --> 34:35.560
There was only one screenshot before then, but it was briefly after he uploaded, which

34:35.560 --> 34:41.640
was the classic 301 views mechanism, and as you can see, that like to dislike ratio speaks

34:41.640 --> 34:42.640
for itself.

34:42.640 --> 34:46.320
People wanted to believe him, and he gave them enough to make them believe him, so we

34:46.320 --> 34:51.160
can assume the flood of dislikes came after, and this received insignificant coverage first

34:51.160 --> 34:52.160
time around.

34:52.160 --> 34:57.020
The people who watched it tended to defend him, so with the people who mattered to him

34:57.020 --> 35:01.020
on his side, he was ready to battle on I guess.

35:01.020 --> 35:02.420
Would he turn it around?

35:02.420 --> 35:05.900
Well, kinda know the answer, but let's find out anyway.

35:05.900 --> 35:15.100
After this video, it's clear that he had rescued enough of his reputation to appease

35:15.100 --> 35:19.060
the masses that mattered to him, despite the significant evidence suggesting that he was

35:19.060 --> 35:20.900
a less than savoury individual.

35:20.900 --> 35:26.180
He took a hiatus, waited for many people to forget like they do, you know, wait until

35:26.180 --> 35:30.660
his memory suppresses the severity of what he did, you wanna know how long it took people

35:30.660 --> 35:31.660
to forget?

35:31.660 --> 35:40.580
Go on, take a guess, take a stab in the dark, a year, half a year, no, one month, and these

35:40.580 --> 35:45.940
were the ratings on his first actual video back, which clearly had some symbolism.

35:45.940 --> 35:50.240
My god, what a poor soul, it's clear in this video he's trying to use the music

35:50.240 --> 35:55.280
to convey his victimhood, and in this instance it seems he's the victim of his own twisted

35:55.280 --> 35:56.320
urges.

35:56.320 --> 36:01.360
Press 1 in the chat if you too shed a tear for the trials and tribulations of Austin

36:01.360 --> 36:04.680
Jones, the man who has gone through enough.

36:04.680 --> 36:08.520
After this he decided he was going to release more music, covers, and originals.

36:08.520 --> 36:13.040
Another one of his videos back was a collaboration with his friends who I'm sure are very grateful

36:13.040 --> 36:18.480
to be associated with this specimen, or maybe they knew and the clout was worth it, I dunno.

36:18.480 --> 36:23.760
The videos performed okay, but all this was to change when he decided to record acapella

36:23.760 --> 36:24.760
videos.

36:25.240 --> 36:30.640
It was like 30, 40 second shorts of him layered over himself singing, and it was fairly impressive,

36:30.640 --> 36:32.540
and it did decently for views.

36:32.540 --> 36:36.840
So with this in mind, Austin thought, well what if I turn these into full songs, and

36:36.840 --> 36:40.340
so he did, and the views were insane.

36:40.340 --> 36:44.800
Every one of the acapella videos accumulated over a million views, as you can see, what

36:44.800 --> 36:49.800
he did was cover songs and albums from bands who had a real cult following, and therefore

36:49.800 --> 36:54.120
benefited off a fanbase that was probably so committed to their idols that they didn't

36:54.120 --> 36:58.560
really think about the possible background of this suspect individual, and to be honest,

36:58.560 --> 37:03.440
I wouldn't expect them to, YouTube probably chucked in their recommended, if I researched

37:03.440 --> 37:08.040
every person who I've watched and whose videos I've enjoyed, I'd probably be rather

37:08.040 --> 37:10.640
dissatisfied with what I find.

37:10.640 --> 37:14.960
And the sad thing is that these videos are actually really good, and it's clear why

37:14.960 --> 37:16.160
they did so well.

37:16.160 --> 37:20.800
Jones is clearly a highly committed creator who puts a lot of effort into his work, and

37:20.800 --> 37:25.680
in this period he experienced some of his most impressive growth, and so it makes sense,

37:25.680 --> 37:30.440
but it was still disturbing that so many people subscribed to this guy not having awareness

37:30.440 --> 37:34.640
of who they were supporting, and how they may have been in his sights as well.

37:34.640 --> 37:38.920
The evidence that people brought forward initially was viewed as insufficient, and the people

37:38.920 --> 37:43.560
who acknowledged it similarly dismissed it, and many people began to make up excuses for

37:43.560 --> 37:48.880
why his behaviour was acceptable, well he apologised, well it wasn't a big deal, oh

37:48.880 --> 37:53.200
guys, is it really worth the drama, why can't we just get along?

37:53.200 --> 37:55.760
You're merely postponing the inevitable.

37:55.760 --> 37:59.800
This is the problem when people are in denial about their idol, they make up these very

37:59.800 --> 38:05.520
questionable explanations to rationalise what they want to like, and that's the most dangerous

38:05.520 --> 38:09.840
thing, because you are handing him back power that he desperately does not deserve, the

38:09.840 --> 38:12.480
power that enabled him in the first place.

38:12.480 --> 38:16.840
When he was first called out in 2015, he was removed from the tours that he was on, this

38:16.840 --> 38:22.400
was a huge back and forth in which many people who wanted to stop him had to really push

38:22.400 --> 38:23.660
to get him held off.

38:23.660 --> 38:28.040
The two tours in question back then were the Grow Wild tour, and the Warped tour, which

38:28.040 --> 38:33.120
D Fizzy was on as well, and once again, companies only want to do so much to step in.

38:33.120 --> 38:37.700
With enough public pressure, certain places may cave, but at the same time, if Austin

38:37.700 --> 38:42.400
has enough support or at least lack of criticism from his circle, then he will be welcomed

38:42.400 --> 38:46.600
back with open arms, and more importantly, if there are people who are willing to buy

38:46.600 --> 38:51.940
his records, there tends to be an amoral record executive willing to sign and distribute his

38:51.940 --> 38:56.800
content because they can make some fat stacks as well, and after all, what is morality when

38:56.800 --> 38:58.000
there's money involved.

38:58.000 --> 39:02.260
The following clip is from D Fizzy's video in which he reads out emails from companies

39:02.260 --> 39:05.320
after he called Austin Jones out for what he was doing.

39:05.320 --> 39:06.320
Here is one of them.

39:06.320 --> 39:10.440
This game is blank, and I own and operate the blank and blank.

39:10.440 --> 39:11.800
I have been promoting content for 30 years.

39:11.800 --> 39:12.800
I'm not a kid.

39:12.800 --> 39:15.080
Besides being a content promoter, I spend my free time being a part of many organizations

39:15.080 --> 39:16.280
aimed at stopping bullies.

39:16.280 --> 39:19.220
Internet bullies has led to many suicides, more than most people think, and more than

39:19.220 --> 39:20.220
is reported to the news.

39:20.220 --> 39:24.920
I am aware of the Austin Jones situation that you have managed to trend since yesterday,

39:24.920 --> 39:26.120
and I know this kid personally.

39:26.120 --> 39:30.800
I will set aside his issues as he will have to deal with them and his consequences.

39:30.800 --> 39:34.660
What I want to deal with is your incredible need to continue to post about this issue.

39:34.660 --> 39:36.140
I think you made your point.

39:36.140 --> 39:38.220
At this point, you have become an internet troll.

39:38.220 --> 39:39.380
What is your ultimate goal?

39:39.380 --> 39:40.800
To have this kid kill himself?

39:40.800 --> 39:41.880
Is that what you want?

39:41.880 --> 39:45.140
You are a bully, the worst kind, an internet bully.

39:45.140 --> 39:47.980
You say you just want to look out for other people and warn them.

39:47.980 --> 39:49.140
You have accomplished that.

39:49.140 --> 39:53.660
I would implore blank to remove you from the tour for being an internet bully.

39:53.660 --> 39:58.740
I have counted 46 posts you have made to Twitter in the past 19 hours with thousands and thousands

39:58.740 --> 40:01.380
of comments tagging him, just blasting Austin Jones.

40:01.380 --> 40:05.140
Unless you want a dead body at your feet, I would ask blank to tell you to stop, and

40:05.140 --> 40:09.620
I would ask him to remove you from the tour, as you are an embarrassment to his organisation.

40:09.620 --> 40:10.620
And that's what happened.

40:10.620 --> 40:15.200
Allegedly, D Fizzy brought this up with Austin Jones' manager, Brian Stars, and he decided

40:15.200 --> 40:19.540
that actually, it was worth changing the conversation, because when someone brings into question

40:19.540 --> 40:23.580
your client's behaviour, they bring into question your association with them as well.

40:23.580 --> 40:27.700
Now, of course, that is just a testimony, but D Fizzy's been pretty on the money so

40:27.700 --> 40:32.020
far, not to mention he emailed the manager of the tour, Kevin Lyman, who said he'd

40:32.020 --> 40:36.380
look into it, and we all know what that means, and what this led to was a load of ping pong

40:36.380 --> 40:40.740
of who was on the tour, who was off the tour, and D Fizzy got kicked off for a bit and then

40:40.740 --> 40:45.680
he got back on and then Austin was going to come back on too, and it was completely exhausting.

40:45.680 --> 40:49.500
And then the owner of the tour replied, Damon, I think you were starting to tread on thin

40:49.500 --> 40:50.500
ice.

40:50.500 --> 40:51.500
Be careful.

40:51.500 --> 40:56.280
Unfortunately, this is what happens when the prospect of removing someone that might affect

40:56.280 --> 41:01.260
their ticket sales occurs, and it's only when another outcome that the actual controversy

41:01.260 --> 41:04.960
may affect ticket sales and the attempts of other guests comes into account that these

41:04.960 --> 41:06.900
people actually paid attention.

41:06.900 --> 41:09.540
However, at least he was off the tour, right?

41:09.540 --> 41:14.340
Well unfortunately, as Austin garnered further success and more clout and more power to throw

41:14.340 --> 41:19.020
around due to an increasing fanbase, it meant that people were going to work with him regardless,

41:19.020 --> 41:23.180
and that's one of the greatest problems when you make a terrible person successful.

41:23.180 --> 41:29.020
Even if you and 95% of the industry refuse to work with them, the 5% who decide that

41:29.020 --> 41:33.460
they can work with them are normally the worst people, and then they make a lot of

41:33.460 --> 41:37.960
money, and then before you know it, they might be the ones in the industry with influence.

41:37.960 --> 41:39.780
It's a very dangerous cycle.

41:39.780 --> 41:44.080
In the instance of Jones, Brian Stars claimed that he had dropped in, but D Fizzy alleged

41:44.080 --> 41:48.660
that he actually has evidence of the contrary, and I wouldn't necessarily doubt him.

41:48.660 --> 41:53.180
What that shows is that money talks, Austin Jones was selling his own tours, selling his

41:53.180 --> 41:56.220
own music, and no one could stop him.

41:56.220 --> 42:00.860
Back in 2015, commentary wasn't really a significant genre, and the videos calling

42:00.860 --> 42:05.620
Jones out weren't impactful in a way that they might be today, and commentary is important

42:05.620 --> 42:10.220
for this reason because we're not attached to that industry, and as shown in the D Fizzy

42:10.220 --> 42:14.920
situation, the fact that Austin and Damon were both in that circle, calling Austin out

42:14.920 --> 42:17.060
can really affect your career.

42:17.060 --> 42:21.580
Having an independent voice is important in those scenarios, and unfortunately it's clear

42:21.580 --> 42:23.700
that they were nowhere to be found.

42:23.700 --> 42:26.460
And then fast forward later, the owner of the tour said I would still be on the tour

42:26.460 --> 42:29.620
and I wouldn't be kicked off, but then I guess he randomly changed his mind because then

42:29.620 --> 42:33.180
he kicked me off the lineup, and I had to contact him and be like, why?

42:33.180 --> 42:38.020
I had to actually go to his office and beg to be back on the tour, and he had told me

42:38.020 --> 42:42.740
that I should apologize to Austin, and he set up a phone call, but can we go back to

42:42.740 --> 42:47.960
... He had so much potential in his music career, I guess, so people constantly wanted

42:47.960 --> 42:49.040
to protect him.

42:49.040 --> 42:52.180
The higher up people wanted to protect him, and this is how I was treated.

42:52.180 --> 42:53.180
This is the email I received.

42:53.180 --> 42:55.900
It says, Damon, are you up for that call Monday with Austin?

42:55.900 --> 42:57.740
I spoke to him, and he would like this.

42:57.740 --> 43:01.140
So they basically wanted me to set up a call with Austin and apologize to him and make

43:01.140 --> 43:03.060
amends, but I did not do that, obviously.

43:03.060 --> 43:08.540
The only reason why I even went to the meeting to talk to him and try to get back on the

43:08.540 --> 43:11.620
tour is because I had already announced to my viewers that I was going to meet them,

43:11.620 --> 43:15.460
and I was so excited because I went on the year before, and it literally changed my life.

43:15.460 --> 43:20.780
And can we talk about the constant manipulation that he was doing to his fans for years, and

43:20.780 --> 43:22.320
it was constantly justified?

43:22.320 --> 43:25.440
But the fact that no one took it serious because it wasn't illegal content, it was

43:25.440 --> 43:27.960
just twerking, it got to this fucking level.

43:27.960 --> 43:28.960
This is recent.

43:28.960 --> 43:29.960
This is from May.

43:29.960 --> 43:32.880
When I called him out, everyone's like, oh, these screenshots are from two years ago.

43:32.880 --> 43:33.880
He's changed.

43:33.880 --> 43:34.880
No.

43:34.880 --> 43:39.400
The fact that people justified and defended it and believed his stupid ass bullshit apology,

43:39.400 --> 43:41.720
he just got comfortable again and kept doing it.

43:41.720 --> 43:46.160
When you have a strong addiction like this to child pornography, it doesn't change overnight.

43:46.160 --> 43:47.160
You know what I mean?

43:47.160 --> 43:51.160
He continued touring, his career continued growing, and he was continuously able to have

43:51.160 --> 43:54.220
access to underage girls.

43:54.220 --> 43:56.320
And now, we're left here.

43:56.320 --> 43:59.800
What you have now is a situation where Austin is finding his stride.

43:59.800 --> 44:04.280
He's almost immune to criticism, becoming incredibly successful, and his detractors

44:04.280 --> 44:05.880
have been silenced.

44:05.880 --> 44:09.880
But he's allegedly promised to be better, and explained his mental situation.

44:09.880 --> 44:13.760
I mean, if he's genuinely remorseful, he wouldn't do it again, would he?

44:13.760 --> 44:23.340
Now ladies and gentlemen, do I have a surprise for you?

44:23.340 --> 44:27.720
People say to me, James, some of your videos get very, very long, don't they?

44:27.720 --> 44:28.720
And you know what?

44:28.720 --> 44:29.720
They do.

44:29.720 --> 44:31.340
But I don't intend to make them that way.

44:31.340 --> 44:36.900
Every video I set out typically to be around four parts, maybe 30 minutes, and my videos

44:36.900 --> 44:40.920
that have performed the best with the click through rate typically do end up around that

44:40.920 --> 44:41.920
time.

44:41.920 --> 44:46.720
But sometimes, you just find more and more and more to talk about, and Austin Jones is

44:46.720 --> 44:51.760
the Pandora's box that once opened released All Hell Upon The World.

44:51.760 --> 44:52.760
What is this hell?

44:52.760 --> 44:57.360
Well, we had our warning, he said he'd learn, he was in a dark place, and suddenly he was

44:57.360 --> 44:59.440
at the peak of his success.

44:59.440 --> 45:00.640
So let me set the scene.

45:00.640 --> 45:06.000
It was August 2016, approximately one month after Jones had released his acapella version

45:06.000 --> 45:11.320
of I Write Sins, not Tragedies by Panic at the Disco, this video was performing well,

45:11.360 --> 45:16.620
and his other video, prior to that, Welcome To The Black Parade, was also incredibly successful.

45:16.620 --> 45:21.600
And of course, even if you're successful, you can be in a dark place, I completely understand

45:21.600 --> 45:22.600
that.

45:22.600 --> 45:26.380
But at the same time, this should prove that certain circumstances that he cited as present

45:26.380 --> 45:30.900
in his previous explanation were no longer there, and he knows better at this point.

45:30.900 --> 45:33.000
He had denounced his actions.

45:33.000 --> 45:38.000
And this followed through to May 2017, when he was achieving continued success with his

45:38.000 --> 45:39.420
acapella performances.

45:39.420 --> 45:41.220
There is no excuse.

45:41.220 --> 45:44.580
And this is the thing, the following details that we should note don't just show how

45:44.580 --> 45:49.220
selfish he was in the past, how he was only doing it for himself, but open a whole new

45:49.220 --> 45:53.540
dimension of this messed up, cruel, sadistic person.

45:53.540 --> 45:58.300
This is the guy who apologised and moved past it, and let me make this clear, these court

45:58.300 --> 46:06.460
cases bring forward two new victims, Victim A in 2017, May, and Victim B in August 2016,

46:06.460 --> 46:09.140
the two previous scenarios that I was explaining.

46:09.140 --> 46:12.340
So let's talk about the details, which are very worrying.

46:12.340 --> 46:16.500
What really highlights his incredibly perverted nature was the fact that he always seemed

46:16.500 --> 46:21.240
obsessed with his fans being 14, to the point where he would actually make sure they would

46:21.240 --> 46:26.080
stay out their age, would wear more suggestive clothing, and even encourage the people to

46:26.080 --> 46:28.980
stay up, even if they had school the next day.

46:28.980 --> 46:31.140
After all, who cares about school?

46:31.140 --> 46:35.880
Even when, in this instance, Victim A was tired, Jones pressed on, she said she was

46:35.880 --> 46:41.120
gonna pass out, and Jones demanded that she take it seriously, Austin needs his kicks

46:41.120 --> 46:45.440
after all, but alas, no clapping, damn underwear.

46:45.440 --> 46:50.300
So far this is legitimately disgusting, the way that Jones is completely disregarding

46:50.300 --> 46:56.080
this person's actual life and placing his own desires above all else, this is his priority,

46:56.080 --> 47:02.240
a complete disregard for anyone else's humanity to pursue the goal of his own twisted fulfilment,

47:02.240 --> 47:08.120
he can't even wait a night, however what happens next is unbelievably bad, and I would

47:08.120 --> 47:10.920
recommend strapping in for this part.

47:10.920 --> 47:15.760
Jones moves the conversation into very explicit territory, creating discussion about bonus

47:15.760 --> 47:18.600
and whether this girl has the capacity to deliver this.

47:18.600 --> 47:22.680
I will not dwell on this for too long, but it has to be acknowledged, so I can now comment

47:22.680 --> 47:27.760
on how much of an awful person he really is, I can't emphasise that enough, because even

47:27.760 --> 47:32.480
when the conversation moves in this direction deplorably, he's still manipulating the

47:32.480 --> 47:37.720
environment and using his dissatisfaction as cause to move the conversation down a more

47:37.720 --> 47:43.200
graphic road, basically it's not provocative enough so he can't pop a boner, if the old

47:43.200 --> 47:47.960
video of him talking about how horny he was wasn't enough admission that his intention

47:47.960 --> 47:53.920
for gathering these videos is quite clear this person was 14 years old, 14, it's perverted,

47:53.920 --> 47:56.080
it's messed up, it's enraging.

47:56.080 --> 47:59.880
In Victor May's case, there were multiple videos in which the person revealed their

47:59.880 --> 48:04.280
private parts and declared their age, out of the constant lingering fear that they were

48:04.280 --> 48:10.400
somewhat obliged to this cretin, in case he went and found anyone else because he inadvertently

48:10.400 --> 48:14.760
degraded people by holding his power over them, which basically made them feel like

48:14.760 --> 48:19.760
they had to do these things to please him, and the continual self-reference to age shows

48:19.760 --> 48:22.760
that this was where Austin's preferences lay.

48:22.760 --> 48:27.880
Austin wasn't just targeting fans who happened to be 14, he was specifically targeting 14

48:27.880 --> 48:28.880
year olds.

48:28.880 --> 48:35.800
Which leads us to our next case, Victim B. Victim B is a lot like Victim A, 14, but Austin

48:35.800 --> 48:37.200
wouldn't have you believe that.

48:37.200 --> 48:41.920
He once again dances into the DMs, acting like it's an honour that this person has

48:41.920 --> 48:44.260
been blessed by his presence.

48:44.260 --> 48:47.520
He really shouldn't be doing this, you know, the Vagabond.

48:47.520 --> 48:51.600
Jones tells her how lucky she is, she says how much of a fan she is.

48:51.600 --> 48:55.040
Jones tells her that she'll have to keep proving she's his biggest fan if he wants

48:55.040 --> 48:59.520
to win the Austin Jones lottery and have a chance of sucking his dick.

48:59.520 --> 49:04.040
Apparently sucking dick is correlated to being a fan of people, I'm a fan of a lot of people

49:04.040 --> 49:05.040
then.

49:05.040 --> 49:08.700
And this usual stick ensued, she didn't want to do it, Jones called into question

49:08.700 --> 49:14.040
her official status as his biggest fan, and used it as blackmail into making this mind

49:14.040 --> 49:18.720
objectify themselves and perform acts to satisfy the rocket in his pocket.

49:18.720 --> 49:22.320
And that's what's most uncomfortable, it's how he continues to speak to her in

49:22.320 --> 49:27.600
this juvenile way, acknowledging she's a child, through this condescending tone, go

49:27.600 --> 49:34.080
on, you can do it, shake that ass, wow, you get 10 gold stars, that's so funny and wacky.

49:34.080 --> 49:38.600
You can see it all here, I'll link it in the pinned comment if you're still interested.

49:38.600 --> 49:44.400
Jones continuously pressures this person because he can't see their anus, and I feel unclean

49:44.400 --> 49:46.020
just saying that.

49:46.020 --> 49:51.940
The continuous cycle, and I mean some of the quotes speak for themselves, apparently that's

49:51.940 --> 49:55.500
a sign of caring now, how lucky she is.

49:55.500 --> 50:00.580
And the further reports just speak for themselves, it is legitimately repulsive, and it's quite

50:00.580 --> 50:06.940
sensational that someone would really squander all that talent for a few predatory kicks.

50:06.940 --> 50:11.520
And let's be clear, Austin Jones positioned himself in a place where he could do this,

50:11.520 --> 50:15.540
but it's clear it comes from a place where he lacks self control, because no one with

50:15.580 --> 50:20.300
any level of restraint, regardless of their twisted desires, throws away an unbelievably

50:20.300 --> 50:22.460
successful career for jail time.

50:22.460 --> 50:26.900
He clearly had the worst combination of determination and arrogance.

50:26.900 --> 50:31.220
He's not necessarily stupid, he's clearly good at manipulating his environments in the

50:31.220 --> 50:36.060
moment, but he clearly values the protection that his industry provides far too much as

50:36.060 --> 50:40.740
this sort of get out of jail free card, but when you turn into a liability, they'll be

50:40.740 --> 50:42.980
the first ones to throw you under the bus.

50:42.980 --> 50:46.980
And honestly, I wouldn't mind the bus reversing back over you after what you've done to

50:46.980 --> 50:47.980
these poor people.

50:47.980 --> 50:53.500
And it should have been clear that he couldn't control himself after the run of exposed content.

50:53.500 --> 50:57.340
When I first heard about this incident, I thought to myself, what an absolute tool.

50:57.340 --> 51:01.820
Imagine having all of that influence and pursuing 14 year olds, but it should be clear that

51:01.820 --> 51:06.300
their age was part of the appeal, and he thought his power could negate anything that came

51:06.300 --> 51:07.300
his way.

51:07.300 --> 51:12.020
Fortunately, it didn't, and justice has finally been served, it's hard to look into

51:12.060 --> 51:16.660
a person's mind and understand exactly what they were thinking during the incident, however

51:16.660 --> 51:21.660
Jones' borderline sociopathic exploitation of power should say more than enough about

51:21.660 --> 51:23.620
the sentencing that he deserves.

51:23.620 --> 51:29.260
This was cold, cruel, and calculated, and he needs to take a nice long trip to the slammer,

51:29.260 --> 51:36.220
and with that in mind, I would like to wrap this all up finally.

51:36.220 --> 51:39.420
Some people have to go, and Austin Jones was one of them.

51:39.420 --> 51:44.860
He had proved himself not capable of handling power, and people even gave him a second chance,

51:44.860 --> 51:47.980
whether they actually knew it or not, and he threw it away.

51:47.980 --> 51:52.720
He was a nasty person who had dangerous desires, and clearly chose not to control them.

51:52.720 --> 51:56.660
And second time around, he couldn't hide behind the quote hard times argument, he knew

51:56.660 --> 52:01.140
what he was doing, he may be an idiot in some ways, but it's clearly not a Jekyll and Hyde

52:01.140 --> 52:02.140
situation.

52:02.140 --> 52:06.660
Eventually YouTube did remove his channel, at first they declined to do it, saying that

52:06.660 --> 52:11.220
it wasn't attached to the instance enough, and although I do feel strongly in some instances

52:11.220 --> 52:15.340
about separating the art from the artist, and I want to make it clear that I don't

52:15.340 --> 52:19.340
think some criminals having YouTube channels is inherently destructive, and in fact, I'm

52:19.340 --> 52:23.620
sure YouTube has helped some people move away from certain dangerous activities, but the

52:23.620 --> 52:29.100
problem here is that his crimes are inextricably linked to the power that he has obtained through

52:29.100 --> 52:34.060
YouTube, and if his sentence is shorter than we expect it to be for any reason, and he

52:34.060 --> 52:37.380
comes back to YouTube, he can't have that opportunity.

52:37.380 --> 52:41.780
Much of the footage I have found today can be found elsewhere, if you've found unique

52:41.780 --> 52:46.860
enjoyment in his music, I can't take that away from you, I'd be a hypocrite if I tried

52:46.860 --> 52:51.260
to, there are plenty of bad people who've made songs that I have an emotional connection

52:51.260 --> 52:56.180
to and people could never take away from me, but at the same time, as talented as he is,

52:56.180 --> 53:00.940
I feel that he has proven himself not capable of personally handling that power, so it's

53:00.940 --> 53:05.660
quite clear that he doesn't deserve his channel, nor his fanbase, nor anything associated

53:05.660 --> 53:06.660
with it.

53:06.660 --> 53:10.420
Hopefully his sentence will prevent that, but you can never make any guarantees.

53:10.420 --> 53:14.300
And that's the thing with talented people, even if they do provide something that might

53:14.300 --> 53:19.160
be considered irreplaceable in some aspects, it certainly doesn't overshadow the lives

53:19.160 --> 53:23.500
they could ruin through their rather selfish actions, and that's one of the most disheartening

53:23.500 --> 53:27.860
things about the industry, especially with regards to music, he'd done this terrible

53:27.860 --> 53:32.560
thing and people welcomed him back, they looked at the evidence, the 2015 evidence,

53:32.560 --> 53:36.420
they looked at it in the eye, and they were like, this is fine, I have no doubt that many

53:36.420 --> 53:40.940
people were aware of his behaviour, but because they received some sort of benefit from his

53:40.940 --> 53:45.900
presence, they decided that actually, it wasn't worth addressing, much more just easy to sweep

53:45.900 --> 53:47.040
under the carpet.

53:47.040 --> 53:51.340
On top of this, this led to people who actually called it out, being attacked and threatened

53:51.340 --> 53:55.920
by individuals who clearly had a stake in Austin's success, alienating themselves

53:55.920 --> 54:00.020
from the victims, and denying the severity of the scenarios themselves.

54:00.020 --> 54:03.720
By telling them that he had chosen them to speak to out of everyone, and making them

54:03.720 --> 54:08.780
feel quote special, Jones tended to make people feel like their incident with him was isolated,

54:08.780 --> 54:13.160
and therefore many people would maybe dismiss it as him having a funny 5 minutes, or feel

54:13.160 --> 54:18.120
reluctant to come forward as a sole witness to what he was doing, and this is why it initially

54:18.120 --> 54:23.540
took so long to corroborate accounts, and actively took another person with actual respect

54:23.540 --> 54:28.700
from the community to come forward, and even then he was doubted and attacked by an industry

54:28.700 --> 54:33.300
that wanted to forgive someone who should have known better, and even if he was sorry,

54:33.300 --> 54:37.080
he shouldn't have been doing any tours and meet and greets with minors at all.

54:37.080 --> 54:41.580
It was unbelievable how many people felt it appropriate to place someone who quite clearly

54:41.580 --> 54:46.260
had an instinctive attraction to a certain demographic in control of members of that

54:46.260 --> 54:47.260
demographic.

54:47.260 --> 54:51.220
It would be like hiring a nonce as a babysitter, it doesn't matter if they're repentant,

54:51.220 --> 54:55.060
you still shouldn't actively leave them in the vicinity of something that activates

54:55.060 --> 54:56.060
their instincts.

54:56.060 --> 55:00.740
A high majority of young people are vulnerable, whether they're 4 or 14, because they haven't

55:00.740 --> 55:02.380
reached the peak of decision making.

55:02.380 --> 55:06.340
I'm far from the person I was when I was 14, and I'm thankful that I wasn't really

55:06.340 --> 55:11.080
invested in the internet the same way I am today, because honestly I'm not quite sure

55:11.080 --> 55:12.780
how I would have coped with it.

55:12.780 --> 55:17.060
It's hard to put these sorts of crimes on the spectrum, because anything involving exploitation

55:17.060 --> 55:22.180
of minors is absolutely horrific, but as the listing of such photos goes, this is definitely

55:22.180 --> 55:27.620
one of the worst cases, predominantly because he completely wages that power in an absolutely

55:27.620 --> 55:31.720
obscene manner, readily ruining these people's lives for a quick kick.

55:31.720 --> 55:36.140
You have to make sure that you do not become attached to people like Austin Jones, however

55:36.140 --> 55:40.640
unlike the Bud-day, Austin Jones could be considered attractive in some fashions, and

55:40.640 --> 55:45.340
on top of the fact that he was also talented, this gave him immense power over his fans.

55:45.340 --> 55:49.860
As fans, it's so important to realise that having your own identity is more important

55:49.860 --> 55:52.900
than mindlessly indoctrinating yourself in an idol.

55:52.900 --> 55:54.820
Am I saying that you shouldn't have idols?

55:54.820 --> 55:59.260
Of course not, feel free to go and love whoever you want to love, especially if it's me.

55:59.260 --> 56:03.700
What I'm saying is that you have to be critical, and that's dangerous when you look at some

56:03.700 --> 56:08.340
of these stans, they would give up their organs for some of the people they support, and when

56:08.340 --> 56:13.660
you tie yourself to something so unconditionally, you open yourself up to exploitation, because

56:13.660 --> 56:16.960
they know they can do anything and you'll remain loyal.

56:16.960 --> 56:21.860
It's always about being able to take a step back and calling them out, about being able

56:21.860 --> 56:25.720
to see someone like Austin's actions for what they are.

56:25.720 --> 56:30.660
Eventually people did see it in Austin's case, and thanks to social media and actual records,

56:30.660 --> 56:34.700
people managed to properly bring these cases forward, and hopefully it won't be too long

56:34.700 --> 56:38.740
until he's serving some real jail time and isn't a danger to anyone else.

56:38.740 --> 56:42.300
Unfortunately, this could and should have been dealt with earlier, and there are people

56:42.300 --> 56:43.860
who are responsible for that.

56:43.860 --> 56:49.080
The story of Austin Jones is a story of manipulation in many ways, I want to make it abundantly

56:49.080 --> 56:53.780
clear that a lot of the techniques that he used in his videos are the exact same techniques

56:53.780 --> 56:57.540
that might be used by people with genuine intent to convey a message.

56:57.540 --> 57:01.700
There are many people who sit down and explain their actions in an honest manner, however

57:01.700 --> 57:06.220
in the context of the situation, it becomes quite clear that what he said was not the

57:06.220 --> 57:10.880
truth, and even if it was, he clearly consciously used it as an excuse rather than actually

57:10.880 --> 57:15.260
believing it as a sincere retrospective analysis of his actions.

57:15.260 --> 57:20.120
He doesn't have the capacity to be sincere, you have to pay close attention and extract

57:20.120 --> 57:24.580
the facts in these situations, dealing with serious allegations here there isn't room

57:24.580 --> 57:29.720
for leverage, and people should have identified that when the DMs originally surfaced, that

57:29.720 --> 57:34.000
he was transparently taking advantage of people, suggesting that they weren't his biggest

57:34.000 --> 57:38.520
fan for not twerking for them, that's not fun in games, people seem to overlook how

57:38.520 --> 57:42.800
genuinely disgusting a lot of his language was, and how that should have indicated that

57:42.800 --> 57:48.040
he was a nasty nasty cretin, even with what he was demanding, I hope he goes away for

57:48.040 --> 57:50.200
a very long time.

57:50.200 --> 57:57.140
It's clear that he has failed to learn from what he likes to call his mistakes.

57:57.140 --> 57:59.280
What are your thoughts on the situation?

57:59.280 --> 58:04.520
I would love to hear them in the comments section below, I have to give a massive huge

58:04.520 --> 58:10.740
shoutout to my editors, this was a long one, my longest one for a while I think, I really

58:10.740 --> 58:16.880

58:16.880 --> 58:24.880
