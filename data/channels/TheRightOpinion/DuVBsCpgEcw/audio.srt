00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,560
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,580
too much free time, and today we're going to my favourite genre of all, music.

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,280
Because your boy here, he loves the tunes, it's pretty much what I'm raised on.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,040
As I write this script, I'm actually currently listening to Mary's Prayer by Danny Wilson,

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,880
wasn't sure about it at first, but I'll say, sophisticated pop songs do tend to grow

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,880
on you.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,280
Unfortunately, today's topic won't be exactly focusing on my adoration for music, no, today

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,640
we will be talking about a person called Austin Jones, who decided to take advantage

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,560
of the clout given by such a blessed industry.

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,920
However, to open this, I will at least be discussing some media related elements, because

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,940
music is a unique industry for so many reasons, and it generates so much creative variety

12
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,460
that is out there, particularly in the last few years.

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,280
As the internet has become increasingly prevalent in the distribution of content, we've seen

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,980
a real wave of music become popular that otherwise wouldn't ever have the chance.

15
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,720
There is a lot of music that originates from YouTube, I've spoken about this before,

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,820
but you have some teen boy, swooshed hair, bent over his acoustic guitar, staring into

17
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:08,380
the camera, singing a sincere song about how much he wants to hold you, and suddenly their

18
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,420
subscriber count explodes, regardless of how good the music actually is.

19
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,500
But at the same time, you have to give credit to the musical achievements that YouTube has

20
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,060
provided, from the early days of Chocolate Rain, to repopularising that weird trollolol

21
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,060
song.

22
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:28,020
We haven't seen such a wave of unique music since the early 1990s in many ways, it's

23
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,440
just unlike then when we had music blasting onto the scene with great furor, the modern

24
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,060
wave has been mostly downbeat, and mostly pretty depressing, and therefore it's never

25
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,220
felt like a huge shock, more just like a musical cigarette.

26
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,300
This is where we introduce the subject of today's video, Austin Jones, the blonde haired,

27
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,940
blue eyed, dreamboat.

28
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,500
But no, he's not just a pretty face, he's also a predator, and we're not just talking

29
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,900
about allegations here, he's pleaded guilty in court, this is all fairly certain at this

30
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,900
point.

31
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,780
Austin Jones himself is a 26 year old musician, fresh out of Illinois.

32
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,300
He wasn't the most identifiable of personalities, but he was clearly popular enough to amass

33
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:13,380
well over 500,000 subscribers, we don't know the exact amount as his channel was terminated

34
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,460
recently following his court case, but it was enough to make him matter.

35
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,940
Predominately he was a musician who typically focused on covers, original music, and also

36
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,820
acapellas, and making a fairly hefty career out of it, which we'll talk about later.

37
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:32,220
However he also did certain videos that I assume were to create a bond with his audience,

38
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,140
most of which are now unfortunately lost to the vaults of time, but nonetheless I think

39
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:41,500
we can take the remains and put the pieces back together and create some sort of picture,

40
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,500
and discuss that bond and how he exploited it.

41
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,340
Austin started his career in 2007, and although it certainly took a while to gain traction,

42
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,020
his continuous run of constant uploads and running off the popular genre paid its dues,

43
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,160
and gradually his videos gained traction.

44
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,160
This gave him more leverage to experiment with, and at some point he did these acapellas,

45
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,600
which were what really bolstered his career, and eventually his content ended up amassing

46
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,100
over 33 million views in total, alongside the sub count we discussed earlier.

47
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,720
Much in lieu of my other video on the TikTok predator the budday, this video will be unpacking

48
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,540
some of the build up, the abuse of power, and the subsequent moves he pulled out to

49
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,620
evade backlash, and indeed pull an almost unbelievable turnaround after a situation

50
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,700
that really could have finished his career, in fact the only thing that stopped him in

51
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,140
the end was the heavy hand of the law.

52
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:36,180
I remember when I first heard about this situation a couple years back in 2017, I wasn't making

53
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,100
content that remotely resembled the work I was doing today, but either way, I dismissed

54
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,100
him.

55
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,700
You know, he's gonna get what he deserves, I'm thankful that actually he's not gonna

56
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:50,620
be around, and to an extent that's true, he was a disgusting twat, but that was not the

57
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,860
end of it, no, and now with these new developments, we're about to find out why, and investigate

58
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,880
some deeper discussions beyond that.

59
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,700
You see, although the attention on him has been widely pursued in the last two years,

60
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,020
there have been people trying to bring attention to his behaviour since 2015.

61
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:10,640
Many of these attempts to no avail at all, with the most being a non-apology in which

62
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,580
Austin only demonstrates more of his manipulative tendencies, the years after were not just

63
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:20,260
successful for Austin, they were his most successful, and that's what I find deeply

64
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,860
troubling, and I think it's time we understand how exactly that happened, and how he loved

65
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,980
to abuse his power.

66
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:33,060
So without further ado, I suggest we pursue the curious case of Austin Jones.

67
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:22,880
In many ways, what we see with Austin Jones is a classic ascension to power.

68
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,880
He is the epitome of a teenage heartthrob, in that he represents the sort of lovely accessible

69
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,540
idol who is there for you, who understands how you feel.

70
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,320
Now unfortunately, or fortunately depending on your perspective, as his channel is no

71
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,340
longer in existence, we have to take what little archive knowledge we can obtain, but

72
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,380
I don't think it's too difficult to completely break down exactly why he found himself in

73
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,900
a position of power.

74
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,860
Firstly he was a YouTube OG, he set up his channel in 2007, he was allowed to excel on

75
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,900
a platform with less competition, and he was also ahead of the curve in many aspects.

76
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,820
YouTube exploded as a platform for actual professional musicians a few years after,

77
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,380
and Austin Jones was already there putting up covers.

78
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,960
Now his covers typically did well, appearing to exceed the number of views to the subscribers

79
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,240
he had fairly impressively, but as we well know, typically making covers isn't the

80
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,600
only way to hold on to the audience you have.

81
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:20,120
But you see, Austin Jones had the looks, and he also had the eye contact, and he also had

82
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,720
the choice for songs.

83
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,720
What do I mean?

84
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,180
But let's talk about One Direction, one of the most prolific boy bands of the 2010s.

85
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,160
Why were they so successful?

86
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,040
Well because of the young, impressionable teenage girls, but also because of how they

87
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,200
marketed to them.

88
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,060
Now one of the things that you become extremely aware of if you've listened to music in

89
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,400
a critical fashion was what one would call the second person perspective.

90
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,500
Second person perspective is focusing on the word you, it's a narrative perspective from

91
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,140
your point of view, and One Direction mastered it.

92
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,980
What makes you beautiful gotta be you.

93
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,860
The list goes on, and on, and on, and the reason that shameless musical executives did

94
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,540
this was because the vulnerable, insecure girl loves to be comforted by the cute, charming

95
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,980
boy who just wants to make you feel wanted.

96
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,180
Oh wait, that's a different twat.

97
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,740
I do apologise, there are just so many of them, especially early 2010s.

98
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:20,260
I do not know what we were on, but PG singles about how much boys love you was the in thing.

99
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:24,780
Austin Jones definitely played into that rule, having that sort of song that was addressed

100
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,280
to you, the listener, where he would tell you how valued or loved you are, he'd have

101
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,940
this cheeky look at the camera, and all you bitches were expected to swoon appropriately.

102
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,360
If anything's left, you can have a look at the comment sections on one of his very, very

103
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,340
old videos, back in the day, and you get the comments that are completely won over.

104
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,500
For another one of his videos, sake of falling in love, we can observe the comments.

105
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:22,040
If anyone can guess those YouTubers who voice them, you get a gold star from me, the right opinion.

106
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,920
Now that is just one page.

107
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,940
Of course, not all of these comments are alluding to Austin's looks or his romantic capabilities,

108
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,040
but they should show the sort of audience that he was appealing to at this point, the

109
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,700
sort of emotional character who cries whenever a blonde boy breathes in their direction.

110
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,260
He is very cleverly creating an audience that is vulnerable in of itself, and therefore

111
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,160
he can use that to his advantage, and so he did.

112
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,760
The sort of thing can be found on his Twitter, or what was his Twitter, because it's no longer there.

113
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,480
Well, it is there, but it's someone who clearly hasn't taken advantage of the notion of a parody account.

114
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,200
I mean, come on, you can be more creative than that.

115
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,400
But anyhow, his Twitter was conducted of firstly putting out vague, sensual tweets that make

116
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,240
the impressionable audience think, oh wow, this guy gets me.

117
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,160
At the same time, a lot of these tweets tended to focus on his vulnerability, or how indebted

118
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,220
he was to his fans, and this put him on their level.

119
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,220
It makes him seem more relatable or warm to an extent.

120
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,300
He owes you his life, guys.

121
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,800
Wow, he would do anything for you people.

122
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,060
He might not have made it this far if you hadn't bought his albums.

123
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,800
At the same time it guilt trips people who haven't bought the album, it's a good double

124
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,260
bind where he ends up favourably in either line of reasoning.

125
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:37,380
The other types of tweets he did were those which heavily relied on the interactions with his fans.

126
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,040
Now, there were even less examples of those, but I found one time where his page was archived

127
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,820
in 2013, and a high majority of the tweets were what, judging from the format, I believe

128
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,420
were quote tweets, in which he would regularly interact with his fans about their purchase

129
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,820
or enjoyment of Jones' content, though I did find this excellent tweet that definitely

130
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,800
shows a more flirtive side of Jones, which we are going to witness in a much more aggressive

131
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,260
form very soon.

132
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,700
For the new trace he writes,

133
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,300
Austin quaintly replies with

134
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,640
Now, to be frank, I don't really have a problem with comedic flirting, hell I do it all the

135
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,780
time with my mates, but at the same time, this is foreshadowing irony that this girl

136
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,540
clearly isn't aware of.

137
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,580
It's all banter until you realise that there is actually a slightly deeper context.

138
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:34,100
With his new power, Austin became quite aware of who he was appealing to, and one of the

139
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,940
other techniques that became quite prominent in his later content was the use of other

140
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,420
sizeable fanbases, typically if you have topics that are relating to someone with more of

141
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,660
a cult following, your sort of tribute to them will spill over into an appeal, so for

142
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:52,100
example if someone did an Ariana Grande or BTS acapella, they'd probably do very well,

143
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,100
although I doubt they'd make much money because it would be claimed.

144
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,760
And so Austin goes for the stans who are either gonna want to send you their heart or want

145
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,900
to eat yours out depending on how well you execute your behaviour, and this brings us

146
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,720
to the final positive but equally depressing point about Austin's appeal.

147
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,140
He was actually talented, terrible people can be incredibly talented, and although Austin's

148
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:18,040
music and covers themselves weren't indicative of anyone with exceptional flair, his acapella

149
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,340
covers definitely were, and I'm not gonna play them here because fair use on YouTube

150
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,200
is in ruins right now, but I'll leave a link to an archived version, and what he does is

151
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,460
quite exceptional, and it would require an incredible amount of concentration and perseverance,

152
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,840
there were very few people who could consistently layer themselves doing covers in such a tight

153
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,220
fashion and then do it again, and again, and again.

154
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,960
He was creating a brand for himself out of what is now quite a fairly exhausted genre.

155
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:48,820
With success comes power, and with power comes, well, let's find out.

156
00:11:52,340 --> 00:12:00,580
Manipulation is the word of the day to day chaps, because what Austin Jones did on YouTube

157
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,720
was textbook manipulation of the algorithms to obtain success.

158
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,960
Now that is the story of the success of many YouTubers, you observe the trends, you work

159
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,900
out how you benefit off of it, and then you embark on the journey to become a successful

160
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,900
YouTuber.

161
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,280
In the case of Austin Jones, he worked out the audience that he wanted to obtain and

162
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,880
subsequently obtained them.

163
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,800
The year is 2015, although not as big as he would be, Austin Jones has successfully manipulated

164
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,920
the algorithms into a position of power.

165
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,480
However, as foreshadowed, there is a lot more to the story than just the manipulations of

166
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
the algorithms.

167
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,200
When you have an idol who is successful like Austin Jones, and you know he's out there

168
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,920
being so interactive, it makes you think, oh yeah, I've got this chance with this guy,

169
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,080
there's this clip of him at a One Direction slash 5 seconds of summer concert, he's being

170
00:12:47,080 --> 00:13:05,320
thrown out, and all these girls are screaming his name, oh my god, it's Austin Jones!

171
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,540
He is absolutely reveling in this, and when he builds that relationship, he can then slide

172
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:17,480
into the DMs, and once he gets there, he plays off this sort of good cop, bad cop dynamic.

173
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,660
One side of him is incredibly grateful, so lovely and humble, and the other side of him

174
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,380
is more primitive, aggressive and dominative, and what he does is in these confrontations

175
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:31,340
he tends to mesh these two personas together fairly deftly to try and coerce what he wants

176
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,340
from people.

177
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,520
So we're gonna go trawling through this content, and identifying the various techniques he's

178
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,520
pulled off.

179
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,300
Now there are a load of examples of these, and to go through all of them, well we'd end

180
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:45,840
up going round in circles, so I want to take one example, this one, a series of texts I

181
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,320
found posted by Lauren Miller, I don't know if these are her own, but we can break it

182
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,420
down fairly comprehensively in the meantime, and I want you to put yourself in the shoes

183
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:59,140
of the adoring fangirl who is finally having the honour of speaking to their idol, who

184
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:04,780
has already solicited some form of imagery as shown in the text, and yet still wants

185
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,780
more.

186
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:11,320
What we see here in this message is the breaking of tone in the conversation, or well, supposed.

187
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,960
By saying let me be honest here, it implies that now he's going to be more sincere than

188
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
he has before.

189
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:22,540
Then he says, I'm having a really down night, this puts him in a position of vulnerability.

190
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,740
We already know he's tweeting about coping with depression, so in this he is using that

191
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,560
mental illness to place him in a position requiring support.

192
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,880
What is that support?

193
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,680
Well I think I know, but not satisfied with just that, he then puts the fan in a position

194
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,960
of exclusivity.

195
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,860
You see he's only chosen to talk to her, how blessed she should be that this huge public

196
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,860
figure has gone out of his way for her.

197
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:50,440
So what you have so far is multiple tactics used in the space of a few sentences, you

198
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,140
have sincerity, vulnerability, and exclusivity.

199
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:58,720
This pushes pressure onto someone who is probably already desperate to impress their idol, a

200
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,200
person who is also rather young, and probably rather impressionable, and then with all this

201
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,660
in mind, he goes in with a request.

202
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,600
And I'm pretty impressed that the girl in this instance said no to him.

203
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,160
Now for some people, no means no, but for Austin, no means the yes that hasn't quite

204
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,360
been said yet.

205
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,560
He presses again, and then the girl rejects again, and once again the girl replies very

206
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,560
responsibly.

207
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,140
At this point, even though this lass has spelled out the exact reasons why she doesn't want

208
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:31,180
to hand over any more content to this predatory creature, he acts confused, he doesn't understand,

209
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,580
pretty much trying to mentally exhaust the person, continuously asking the person to

210
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,180
justify their reasoning.

211
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:41,600
Now explanations in these instances are being built on premises, and what Austin here is

212
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,640
trying to do is reach the premises so he can perhaps invalidate them and thus invalidate

213
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,040
their reasoning, thus guilt tripping them into providing him with more content.

214
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,140
And she doesn't crack, which fair play.

215
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:58,020
She points out the age gap, he dismisses these 3 points as casually and says, oh guys,

216
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,700
this is just for fun, yes, great banter.

217
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,660
He then asks if he can offer something in return, and the girl justifiably says that

218
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,560
the fact that he is messaging her is more than enough, and I think what should be quite

219
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,300
clear now is that this girl is in a vulnerable position, to the point where she still clearly

220
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:18,980
idolises him in spite of these highly uncomfortable advances, and instead of taking a step back

221
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:24,420
and being able to humanise the situation, Austin Jones pushes on to achieve his only

222
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,420
goal.

223
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,260
It's the messages after that become a vault to his ever stranger mind.

224
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,380
After the girl said that talking to him is an honour, he takes this as a chance to once

225
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:39,240
again hold his power over her, he brags, he receives thousands of messages, loads of people

226
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,340
out there wanting to talk to this world famous Austin Jones, and yet he is talking to her

227
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,780
out of everyone.

228
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:52,040
What he is trying to do right now is alienate the person from these objections of inappropriateness.

229
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,400
This person has raised the point that she is 14, but Austin isn't targeting her because

230
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,360
she's 14, he's targeting her because he was just randomly scrolling through and has decided

231
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,440
that the lucky winner of the Austin Jones luxury lewd lotto will be this lovely lass.

232
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,020
He just wants to talk to her.

233
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,020
Age?

234
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,020
What?

235
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,020
What's age?

236
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,140
Some silly concept?

237
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,060
Who cares about age?

238
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:20,100
At the same time he implicitly degrades the person he's talking to, despite the fact

239
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:25,240
that he promoted that exclusivity earlier, it was tainted with a tone of disposability.

240
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,520
There are thousands of people just like her, and he can just scroll to another DM and find

241
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,460
another fangirl who will give him what he needs so desperately.

242
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,740
Through this he creates a contradiction, on one hand he claims that he can go and get

243
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,060
this content from any of his other fans, but at the same time he is clearly driven to obtain

244
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,500
it from this one fangirl, or else he would've just given up on the first try.

245
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,380
Maybe that's because he can't obtain content like that from anywhere else, or maybe that's

246
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,560
because he just wants to get his way, given the fact that he did solicit content from

247
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,860
other people in the same boat, it might well be both.

248
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,740
I think he clearly has some kind of twisted desire to take advantage of this power dynamic

249
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:06,100
that he holds, and fair play to that girl for being able to turn him down, because many

250
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,060
people didn't.

251
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:12,420
Austin is clearly Austin's middle name, and you can see this in the final few DMs

252
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,420
that have been published.

253
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:18,300
The girl asks him, appealing to him on the grounds of human decency, saying that would

254
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:23,100
you do something that you're not comfortable with, aware that a fan is presenting her perspective,

255
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,780
he turns around and says, well yes actually if I wanted to make them happy, thus once

256
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:32,700
again undermining her reasoning, blatantly deceptive, and extremely malicious.

257
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,860
Oh and look, he'll twerk too now, how charitable.

258
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:42,120
Basically what you see here is Jones completely taking advantage of that fan admiration, singling

259
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,420
them out in conversation, using that power to intimidate them, and then using various

260
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:50,020
mental techniques to try and coerce what he wants out of them.

261
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:54,420
He's having a hard time, he really needs those twerking videos guys, he needs them to get

262
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,580
through the night.

263
00:18:55,580 --> 00:19:00,820
My heart weeps for this poor soul who may never have the twerking videos he needs so

264
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,820
desperately.

265
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:07,540
Now, I can't guarantee these DMs are real, but I present the evidence today under the

266
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:12,220
fact that judging by the conviction and the way his language corroborates in various other

267
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,820
DMs, that this is extremely, extremely credible.

268
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,820
What other DMs?

269
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,860
Well there's this one where he was giving another person the exclusive treatment, he

270
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:25,820
wanted to get to know the person through the medium of twerking, and then she says no.

271
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:31,180
Back and forth, same old shtick, he says obviously you don't want to make me happy, which will

272
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:35,900
obviously cut to the heart of the insecure fan, because having someone pass judgement

273
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,120
on your intentions can feel extremely harmful.

274
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,180
So once again he pretty much tries any manipulation tactic under the sun, and I wanted to finish

275
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:49,540
this part on this one clip, just so people know what we were dealing with here.

276
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:59,300
It's just cuz, it's for the benefit of both of us, cuz like, I'm horny like all the time,

277
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:05,300
so if we just keep talking, I'm probably gonna ask for videos on like a daily basis, and

278
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,300
then I'm gonna feel like a dick, and then you guys are gonna reject me and I'm just

279
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,300
gonna feel like shit so, it's just like easier this way.

280
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:18,700
Yeah sorry I'm a guy, but I still love you.

281
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:24,980
Yes, so so classy, and like any situation, he was called out, and as it started spreading

282
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:29,540
he started begging all these people in the DMs, oh please don't do this to me, and as

283
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:34,420
the uproar spread and people got more angered and his fans were turning to him and saying

284
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:40,420
Austin what is going on, he decided that he was going to do one thing, and that was set

285
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:48,180
the record straight.

286
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,180
Austin Jones is face down with all these very serious situations, he's being hit

287
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:57,820
on all sides, and at the end of June 2015, he decided to do the very smart thing and

288
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:06,340
post a video response, no not that one, that's too honest to be his quote official response,

289
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,820
no we're going to be talking about this one, namely setting the record straight.

290
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,580
Now there's a lot to say about this video, and I'll try and cover it all without being

291
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:19,860
caught up in the two minor things, but once again, what you witness is success and manipulating

292
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,500
a situation that really he had no right to.

293
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,620
Now it's fair to say that now the video has received overwhelmingly negative feedback,

294
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,860
many people from all over communities banded together to make sure he was shown up, but

295
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,780
at the same time, looking at the old ratings, he was doing alright, and Austin wasn't

296
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:40,660
really appealing to any of the people who actually care about internet affairs, but

297
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:44,440
more to his loyals who were going to stick around no matter what, and judging by some

298
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,580
statistics that we'll see later, it might just have worked.

299
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,820
So let's talk about how Austin Jones set the record straight.

300
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,620
He's in this situation, he's up against the wall, he has to hold on to the fans that

301
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:00,340
he has, and he has the main platform to do it, he knows what he's done, it's pretty

302
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,100
terrible, and regardless of the delivery, he's gonna come under some fire, so what

303
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,980
he firstly does here is present himself as the reasonable mediator, and I want to play

304
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:13,780
you this opening clip, because there is so many techniques you can break down in it alone.

305
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:46,220
You see lads, here he plays a very two sided card, on one hand, he completely understands

306
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:50,980
that people hate him, and have those negative opinions, and all he's asking to do is to

307
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:56,220
hear him out, but in his delivery, you'll be able to break down some very slight techniques,

308
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:00,380
firstly he implies that people will be receiving the truth from this video, when of course,

309
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,480
when there is only one truth and no one is ever going to see the complete truth, there

310
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,820
are just testimonies, the closest you're going to get to the truth are the screenshots,

311
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,460
and yeah, you're not going to be bringing them out are you?

312
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:15,460
Another great word he uses is the word mistakes, because although it's an admission of misconduct,

313
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:20,580
mistake is a rather forgiving word, as it implies the person was not acting with necessarily

314
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:25,380
ill intent when they behaved in such a way, so already although he hasn't actually said

315
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:30,500
anything of substance to respond to the criticism, he has already used a few rhetorical devices

316
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,860
to elicit sympathy from his more easily influenced viewers.

317
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,900
I now want to play you this excerpt.

318
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:14,260
Here we can see a similar mechanism, he apologises but simultaneously downplays his crime so

319
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,900
people are more forgiving.

320
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,020
He asked his fans for twerking videos, you know twerking, the dance moves, like the floss

321
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,620
or the Macarena.

322
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,260
He obviously fails to mention that many of these fans were underage, and the additional

323
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:29,480
details that we've indulged ourselves with, and we will indulge ourselves with later on,

324
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,720
but there is still more in this segment.

325
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,400
So he speaks about the YouTuber who has brought this to people's attention, I assume he's

326
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,900
referring to D Fizzy or Damon Fizzy who was one of the few people to actually call him

327
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:45,680
out in 2015, but he's not going to name names, how courteous of him, because he knows what

328
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,000
it's like to have been mercilessly attacked and he doesn't want to do that, but in this

329
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,880
instance this isn't a courtesy, this is a tactic to make sure people aren't seeing any

330
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,320
other perspectives and do not know where they are coming from, bar his own, which is also

331
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,680
why he has comments turned off.

332
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:06,320
Also notice how he uses aggressive verbs when he describes how these people have dealt with

333
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,800
him, they've blasted it out there, it makes the people he's talking about sound more instigatory.

334
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,920
We've seen a lot of drama where people have felt the need to play the victim, Austin isn't

335
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,540
doing that exactly, but he is implicitly leading people who may be sympathetic of his cause

336
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,500
to that exact conclusion.

337
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:27,360
All these people going after poor Austin for his old mistakes and he's learned from them,

338
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,640
he's ashamed, and now they're just blasting it out on the internet.

339
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:37,360
Since this started online, there are a lot of rumours and a lot of lies, they're just

340
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,620
not true, nothing ever went further.

341
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:44,600
Now this is a blatant lie, but also one that he could get away with at the time, because

342
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:49,480
at that point the evidence hadn't been widespread and affirmative enough to lead people to different

343
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,840
conclusions, so this allowed him to hold that narrative, which although on one side felt

344
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,200
like he was admitting something, it wasn't like he could deny it, so it wasn't exactly

345
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,760
reasonable on his behalf.

346
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,000
There's a load more in between, talking about how he was on tour, how this hit him,

347
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,880
and then he plays a victim card, but not in the way that you'd expect.

348
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:14,480
A lot of people ask, why did the initial statement take so long to get up?

349
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:20,700
I put up a text statement and apology addressing the situation, but it took me about a week

350
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,680
to do so.

351
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,600
People thought that I was being a coward, people thought that I didn't want to confront

352
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:33,440
the situation, they thought that I was just blowing it off, that's not true.

353
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,240
As I said, I was on the road, I was on tour.

354
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,440
We were all the way in Boston, so we had to make the drive all the way back from Boston

355
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,440
to Chicago.

356
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:49,160
On that drive, the only thing I did was look at my phone and look at all the hate and death

357
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,280
threats.

358
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,600
I got lost in it.

359
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,980
I would read every little comment, every little person telling me to kill myself, every person

360
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:02,720
telling me that life wasn't worth living for me anymore.

361
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,760
And I'm a pretty insecure person, to where negative comments like that really impact

362
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,760
me.

363
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,600
It's not something I can just brush off.

364
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:22,760
That entire ride home, I read those comments and I began researching different suicide

365
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,760
methods.

366
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,340
When we got back, I didn't even step foot in my house.

367
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:35,000
My family took me immediately to the hospital and I was hospitalized for my suicidal tendencies.

368
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,660
So no, I wasn't cowering, I wasn't avoiding the situation.

369
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,360
I was in a hospital.

370
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,800
I had no internet connection, I had no connection to social media, so I couldn't put out a

371
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
statement.

372
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,800
I wanted to.

373
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,800
I wanted to apologize.

374
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:58,320
I wanted to confront it immediately, but I couldn't.

375
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,700
As soon as I got out of the hospital, the next day, that's when I put it up.

376
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:07,040
So that's why the initial statement took so long to get out.

377
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,080
And this is the thing, in some respects, it's a really obvious victim card to the critical

378
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,080
audience.

379
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:18,240
What he's done here is he's smartly played the point as proxy to the not so critical

380
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,240
viewer.

381
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,360
You see, if we respond to criticism by pointing out the hate we've received, we are often

382
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,580
called out for changing the conversation and not confronting the criticism.

383
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:33,320
In this scenario, however, Austin has used the hate he received as a direct response

384
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,320
to the criticism.

385
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,120
He couldn't do something because of the hate he received, which is still somewhat

386
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,200
awkward as an argument, but not as much as it could have been, and serves as a way to

387
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,000
convey his victimhood without being a necessarily invalid response.

388
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,440
The video is meant to be a response to a lot of the criticism he's received, and it does

389
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,560
do that in a way, but it constantly detours down the road of the hard times that he's

390
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,020
having as a response.

391
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:03,080
This can be particularly found in the extended anecdote throughout the final part of his

392
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,400
video where he talks about his life and the struggles that he's experienced, and how

393
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,960
that created the mindset that led him to do these fun and goofy things.

394
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,520
The biggest question I get asked is why?

395
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,760
Why did this happen?

396
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,760
Why did I ask for those things?

397
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,760
So in order to figure out why, you have to look at the reasons, and the reasons lie in

398
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:34,540
my past, and in what I've experienced through life, and how I even got to that point.

399
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:40,160
I experienced death and loss at a very young age.

400
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,160
I had an older sister.

401
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,620
She passed away when she was ten years old.

402
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,100
I was six years old at the time.

403
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:52,360
I went through a series of funerals when I was very young.

404
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,780
Most were distant relatives that I either didn't even know at all, or I had only seen

405
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:02,140
on a few occasions, but I was so young that I really didn't know who they were.

406
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:06,780
I barely saw my father.

407
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:12,180
My parents divorced at a very, very young age, and the last time I saw him was when

408
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,500
I was eight years old.

409
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:20,780
My father was an alcoholic and a drug addict, and he couldn't get control of his life because

410
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,780
of it.

411
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:26,900
When I was sixteen, a few months before he passed away, my family and I, we went through

412
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,220
a house fire.

413
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:33,380
We were away visiting relatives, and somebody broke into our house, stole some things, and

414
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,340
burned the entire house down.

415
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:40,180
About a month after my father passed away, my grandfather passed away, and I was very

416
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,980
close to my grandfather.

417
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,680
After that happened, that's when I began self-harming.

418
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,620
I used to cut my wrists, and I'm over three years clean of that now.

419
00:30:51,620 --> 00:31:05,300
All of these life events, all of these deaths, this loss left me with really deep, deep depression.

420
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:14,180
I was an insecure, depressed guy, and I began searching for attention in the wrong ways,

421
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:18,620
asking fans for those things.

422
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,940
It was because I was desperate for attention.

423
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,780
I was desperate for reassurance.

424
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,380
I wanted to feel good about myself.

425
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,880
At the time, I thought it was just fun and goofy.

426
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,340
Like I said, doesn't excuse my actions, doesn't justify it.

427
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,280
That's not why I told you all of that.

428
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:41,440
I told you it so that you would understand why I was that desperate, why I was even asking

429
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,580
for those things.

430
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:47,940
It was that depression piling up into me searching for attention.

431
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:52,560
A lot of his evidence of his experiences are things that are completely impossible

432
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:57,820
to verify, which although plausible, still inspires scepticism with the context of what

433
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,660
we now know he has done.

434
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,660
For example...

435
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:06,700
So, something else that I want to talk about is people saying that you're only sorry that

436
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,260
you got caught.

437
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,100
You know, you apologise because you got caught.

438
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,960
You don't actually feel sorry.

439
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,020
That's so far from the truth.

440
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:23,800
And there are a few actual examples that show that before I went on tour.

441
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:29,020
And he presents these as quote actual examples, but they're impossible to completely prove

442
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:33,900
and yet he presents them as the counter narrative that he clearly regrets what he did.

443
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:38,500
Every single piece of evidence is circumstantial, but I guess that's good enough for some people.

444
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,700
Finally, I want to bring your attention to this clip.

445
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:49,060
On my last tour, a few months ago, I started going back to therapy for this specific reason.

446
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:56,180
Because I regretted it so much and I couldn't move past it.

447
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,540
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

448
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:02,300
I couldn't stop feeling like absolute shit for what I had done.

449
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:06,420
So I went back to therapy before I left for tour.

450
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:13,740
Also, a few months before this became public, I talked to a couple of my coworkers, if you

451
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:18,140
want to call them that, one of which is very popular online.

452
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:22,860
If you're part of this specific music scene, you'd know exactly who he is if I told you

453
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,860
who he was.

454
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:29,060
So this is a pretty big and I'd like to consider reputable man.

455
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,460
I went to him with this.

456
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,740
I told him my entire past.

457
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:39,100
I told him that I felt so guilty for this and that I regret it and that I wanted to

458
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,620
confess all of this in the video.

459
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:47,780
Come clean about it, just get it off my chest so I can stop living with the guilt and officially

460
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,860
apologize to everybody.

461
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,460
He told me not to.

462
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:57,020
He told me that it would only hurt my career and what I did wasn't even that bad and that

463
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,020
I should just not even think about it.

464
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,220
I just shouldn't do it.

465
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:04,320
Firstly, he goes the Donald Trump route of talking about how he spoke to a man who was

466
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,420
very reputable.

467
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:10,620
Of course, never naming any names, but he's appealing to his authority in this instance,

468
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:15,380
and then he follows it with the fact that this very reputable person actually said demanding

469
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:20,860
twerking videos from fans, that's not bad, and he leans on that authority to justify

470
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,060
why he hasn't spoken about it.

471
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:27,720
It's embarrassingly transparent, and it's a real shame that this actually worked.

472
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,640
This screenshot is the one taken at the 2017 allegations.

473
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,560
There was only one screenshot before then, but it was briefly after he uploaded, which

474
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:41,640
was the classic 301 views mechanism, and as you can see, that like to dislike ratio speaks

475
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,640
for itself.

476
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,320
People wanted to believe him, and he gave them enough to make them believe him, so we

477
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,160
can assume the flood of dislikes came after, and this received insignificant coverage first

478
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,160
time around.

479
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:57,020
The people who watched it tended to defend him, so with the people who mattered to him

480
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:01,020
on his side, he was ready to battle on I guess.

481
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,420
Would he turn it around?

482
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,900
Well, kinda know the answer, but let's find out anyway.

483
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:15,100
After this video, it's clear that he had rescued enough of his reputation to appease

484
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:19,060
the masses that mattered to him, despite the significant evidence suggesting that he was

485
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,900
a less than savoury individual.

486
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:26,180
He took a hiatus, waited for many people to forget like they do, you know, wait until

487
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:30,660
his memory suppresses the severity of what he did, you wanna know how long it took people

488
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,660
to forget?

489
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:40,580
Go on, take a guess, take a stab in the dark, a year, half a year, no, one month, and these

490
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:45,940
were the ratings on his first actual video back, which clearly had some symbolism.

491
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:50,240
My god, what a poor soul, it's clear in this video he's trying to use the music

492
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,280
to convey his victimhood, and in this instance it seems he's the victim of his own twisted

493
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,320
urges.

494
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,360
Press 1 in the chat if you too shed a tear for the trials and tribulations of Austin

495
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,680
Jones, the man who has gone through enough.

496
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,520
After this he decided he was going to release more music, covers, and originals.

497
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:13,040
Another one of his videos back was a collaboration with his friends who I'm sure are very grateful

498
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:18,480
to be associated with this specimen, or maybe they knew and the clout was worth it, I dunno.

499
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,760
The videos performed okay, but all this was to change when he decided to record acapella

500
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,760
videos.

501
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:30,640
It was like 30, 40 second shorts of him layered over himself singing, and it was fairly impressive,

502
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,540
and it did decently for views.

503
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:36,840
So with this in mind, Austin thought, well what if I turn these into full songs, and

504
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,340
so he did, and the views were insane.

505
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:44,800
Every one of the acapella videos accumulated over a million views, as you can see, what

506
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,800
he did was cover songs and albums from bands who had a real cult following, and therefore

507
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,120
benefited off a fanbase that was probably so committed to their idols that they didn't

508
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:58,560
really think about the possible background of this suspect individual, and to be honest,

509
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,440
I wouldn't expect them to, YouTube probably chucked in their recommended, if I researched

510
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,040
every person who I've watched and whose videos I've enjoyed, I'd probably be rather

511
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,640
dissatisfied with what I find.

512
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,960
And the sad thing is that these videos are actually really good, and it's clear why

513
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,160
they did so well.

514
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,800
Jones is clearly a highly committed creator who puts a lot of effort into his work, and

515
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,680
in this period he experienced some of his most impressive growth, and so it makes sense,

516
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,440
but it was still disturbing that so many people subscribed to this guy not having awareness

517
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,640
of who they were supporting, and how they may have been in his sights as well.

518
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,920
The evidence that people brought forward initially was viewed as insufficient, and the people

519
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:43,560
who acknowledged it similarly dismissed it, and many people began to make up excuses for

520
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,880
why his behaviour was acceptable, well he apologised, well it wasn't a big deal, oh

521
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,200
guys, is it really worth the drama, why can't we just get along?

522
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,760
You're merely postponing the inevitable.

523
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,800
This is the problem when people are in denial about their idol, they make up these very

524
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:05,520
questionable explanations to rationalise what they want to like, and that's the most dangerous

525
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,840
thing, because you are handing him back power that he desperately does not deserve, the

526
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,480
power that enabled him in the first place.

527
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,840
When he was first called out in 2015, he was removed from the tours that he was on, this

528
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:22,400
was a huge back and forth in which many people who wanted to stop him had to really push

529
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,660
to get him held off.

530
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:28,040
The two tours in question back then were the Grow Wild tour, and the Warped tour, which

531
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:33,120
D Fizzy was on as well, and once again, companies only want to do so much to step in.

532
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,700
With enough public pressure, certain places may cave, but at the same time, if Austin

533
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:42,400
has enough support or at least lack of criticism from his circle, then he will be welcomed

534
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,600
back with open arms, and more importantly, if there are people who are willing to buy

535
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:51,940
his records, there tends to be an amoral record executive willing to sign and distribute his

536
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:56,800
content because they can make some fat stacks as well, and after all, what is morality when

537
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,000
there's money involved.

538
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,260
The following clip is from D Fizzy's video in which he reads out emails from companies

539
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,320
after he called Austin Jones out for what he was doing.

540
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,320
Here is one of them.

541
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,440
This game is blank, and I own and operate the blank and blank.

542
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,800
I have been promoting content for 30 years.

543
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
I'm not a kid.

544
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,080
Besides being a content promoter, I spend my free time being a part of many organizations

545
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,280
aimed at stopping bullies.

546
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,220
Internet bullies has led to many suicides, more than most people think, and more than

547
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,220
is reported to the news.

548
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:24,920
I am aware of the Austin Jones situation that you have managed to trend since yesterday,

549
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,120
and I know this kid personally.

550
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,800
I will set aside his issues as he will have to deal with them and his consequences.

551
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,660
What I want to deal with is your incredible need to continue to post about this issue.

552
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,140
I think you made your point.

553
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,220
At this point, you have become an internet troll.

554
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,380
What is your ultimate goal?

555
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,800
To have this kid kill himself?

556
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,880
Is that what you want?

557
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,140
You are a bully, the worst kind, an internet bully.

558
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,980
You say you just want to look out for other people and warn them.

559
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,140
You have accomplished that.

560
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:53,660
I would implore blank to remove you from the tour for being an internet bully.

561
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:58,740
I have counted 46 posts you have made to Twitter in the past 19 hours with thousands and thousands

562
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:01,380
of comments tagging him, just blasting Austin Jones.

563
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,140
Unless you want a dead body at your feet, I would ask blank to tell you to stop, and

564
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:09,620
I would ask him to remove you from the tour, as you are an embarrassment to his organisation.

565
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,620
And that's what happened.

566
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:15,200
Allegedly, D Fizzy brought this up with Austin Jones' manager, Brian Stars, and he decided

567
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,540
that actually, it was worth changing the conversation, because when someone brings into question

568
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:23,580
your client's behaviour, they bring into question your association with them as well.

569
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:27,700
Now, of course, that is just a testimony, but D Fizzy's been pretty on the money so

570
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:32,020
far, not to mention he emailed the manager of the tour, Kevin Lyman, who said he'd

571
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:36,380
look into it, and we all know what that means, and what this led to was a load of ping pong

572
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:40,740
of who was on the tour, who was off the tour, and D Fizzy got kicked off for a bit and then

573
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:45,680
he got back on and then Austin was going to come back on too, and it was completely exhausting.

574
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,500
And then the owner of the tour replied, Damon, I think you were starting to tread on thin

575
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,500
ice.

576
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,500
Be careful.

577
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:56,280
Unfortunately, this is what happens when the prospect of removing someone that might affect

578
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:01,260
their ticket sales occurs, and it's only when another outcome that the actual controversy

579
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,960
may affect ticket sales and the attempts of other guests comes into account that these

580
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,900
people actually paid attention.

581
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,540
However, at least he was off the tour, right?

582
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:14,340
Well unfortunately, as Austin garnered further success and more clout and more power to throw

583
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:19,020
around due to an increasing fanbase, it meant that people were going to work with him regardless,

584
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:23,180
and that's one of the greatest problems when you make a terrible person successful.

585
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:29,020
Even if you and 95% of the industry refuse to work with them, the 5% who decide that

586
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:33,460
they can work with them are normally the worst people, and then they make a lot of

587
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:37,960
money, and then before you know it, they might be the ones in the industry with influence.

588
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,780
It's a very dangerous cycle.

589
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:44,080
In the instance of Jones, Brian Stars claimed that he had dropped in, but D Fizzy alleged

590
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:48,660
that he actually has evidence of the contrary, and I wouldn't necessarily doubt him.

591
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:53,180
What that shows is that money talks, Austin Jones was selling his own tours, selling his

592
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,220
own music, and no one could stop him.

593
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:00,860
Back in 2015, commentary wasn't really a significant genre, and the videos calling

594
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:05,620
Jones out weren't impactful in a way that they might be today, and commentary is important

595
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:10,220
for this reason because we're not attached to that industry, and as shown in the D Fizzy

596
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:14,920
situation, the fact that Austin and Damon were both in that circle, calling Austin out

597
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,060
can really affect your career.

598
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:21,580
Having an independent voice is important in those scenarios, and unfortunately it's clear

599
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,700
that they were nowhere to be found.

600
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,460
And then fast forward later, the owner of the tour said I would still be on the tour

601
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,620
and I wouldn't be kicked off, but then I guess he randomly changed his mind because then

602
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:33,180
he kicked me off the lineup, and I had to contact him and be like, why?

603
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:38,020
I had to actually go to his office and beg to be back on the tour, and he had told me

604
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:42,740
that I should apologize to Austin, and he set up a phone call, but can we go back to

605
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:47,960
... He had so much potential in his music career, I guess, so people constantly wanted

606
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,040
to protect him.

607
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,180
The higher up people wanted to protect him, and this is how I was treated.

608
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,180
This is the email I received.

609
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,900
It says, Damon, are you up for that call Monday with Austin?

610
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,740
I spoke to him, and he would like this.

611
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:01,140
So they basically wanted me to set up a call with Austin and apologize to him and make

612
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,060
amends, but I did not do that, obviously.

613
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:08,540
The only reason why I even went to the meeting to talk to him and try to get back on the

614
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,620
tour is because I had already announced to my viewers that I was going to meet them,

615
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:15,460
and I was so excited because I went on the year before, and it literally changed my life.

616
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:20,780
And can we talk about the constant manipulation that he was doing to his fans for years, and

617
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,320
it was constantly justified?

618
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,440
But the fact that no one took it serious because it wasn't illegal content, it was

619
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,960
just twerking, it got to this fucking level.

620
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,960
This is recent.

621
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,960
This is from May.

622
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,880
When I called him out, everyone's like, oh, these screenshots are from two years ago.

623
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,880
He's changed.

624
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,880
No.

625
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,400
The fact that people justified and defended it and believed his stupid ass bullshit apology,

626
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,720
he just got comfortable again and kept doing it.

627
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:46,160
When you have a strong addiction like this to child pornography, it doesn't change overnight.

628
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,160
You know what I mean?

629
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,160
He continued touring, his career continued growing, and he was continuously able to have

630
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,220
access to underage girls.

631
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:56,320
And now, we're left here.

632
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,800
What you have now is a situation where Austin is finding his stride.

633
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,280
He's almost immune to criticism, becoming incredibly successful, and his detractors

634
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,880
have been silenced.

635
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,880
But he's allegedly promised to be better, and explained his mental situation.

636
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,760
I mean, if he's genuinely remorseful, he wouldn't do it again, would he?

637
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:23,340
Now ladies and gentlemen, do I have a surprise for you?

638
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:27,720
People say to me, James, some of your videos get very, very long, don't they?

639
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,720
And you know what?

640
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,720
They do.

641
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,340
But I don't intend to make them that way.

642
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:36,900
Every video I set out typically to be around four parts, maybe 30 minutes, and my videos

643
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,920
that have performed the best with the click through rate typically do end up around that

644
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,920
time.

645
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,720
But sometimes, you just find more and more and more to talk about, and Austin Jones is

646
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:51,760
the Pandora's box that once opened released All Hell Upon The World.

647
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,760
What is this hell?

648
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,360
Well, we had our warning, he said he'd learn, he was in a dark place, and suddenly he was

649
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,440
at the peak of his success.

650
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,640
So let me set the scene.

651
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:06,000
It was August 2016, approximately one month after Jones had released his acapella version

652
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,320
of I Write Sins, not Tragedies by Panic at the Disco, this video was performing well,

653
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:16,620
and his other video, prior to that, Welcome To The Black Parade, was also incredibly successful.

654
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:21,600
And of course, even if you're successful, you can be in a dark place, I completely understand

655
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,600
that.

656
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,380
But at the same time, this should prove that certain circumstances that he cited as present

657
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:30,900
in his previous explanation were no longer there, and he knows better at this point.

658
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,000
He had denounced his actions.

659
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
And this followed through to May 2017, when he was achieving continued success with his

660
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,420
acapella performances.

661
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,220
There is no excuse.

662
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:44,580
And this is the thing, the following details that we should note don't just show how

663
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:49,220
selfish he was in the past, how he was only doing it for himself, but open a whole new

664
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:53,540
dimension of this messed up, cruel, sadistic person.

665
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:58,300
This is the guy who apologised and moved past it, and let me make this clear, these court

666
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:06,460
cases bring forward two new victims, Victim A in 2017, May, and Victim B in August 2016,

667
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:09,140
the two previous scenarios that I was explaining.

668
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:12,340
So let's talk about the details, which are very worrying.

669
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:16,500
What really highlights his incredibly perverted nature was the fact that he always seemed

670
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:21,240
obsessed with his fans being 14, to the point where he would actually make sure they would

671
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:26,080
stay out their age, would wear more suggestive clothing, and even encourage the people to

672
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,980
stay up, even if they had school the next day.

673
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,140
After all, who cares about school?

674
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:35,880
Even when, in this instance, Victim A was tired, Jones pressed on, she said she was

675
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:41,120
gonna pass out, and Jones demanded that she take it seriously, Austin needs his kicks

676
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:45,440
after all, but alas, no clapping, damn underwear.

677
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,300
So far this is legitimately disgusting, the way that Jones is completely disregarding

678
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:56,080
this person's actual life and placing his own desires above all else, this is his priority,

679
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:02,240
a complete disregard for anyone else's humanity to pursue the goal of his own twisted fulfilment,

680
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:08,120
he can't even wait a night, however what happens next is unbelievably bad, and I would

681
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,920
recommend strapping in for this part.

682
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,760
Jones moves the conversation into very explicit territory, creating discussion about bonus

683
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,600
and whether this girl has the capacity to deliver this.

684
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,680
I will not dwell on this for too long, but it has to be acknowledged, so I can now comment

685
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:27,760
on how much of an awful person he really is, I can't emphasise that enough, because even

686
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,480
when the conversation moves in this direction deplorably, he's still manipulating the

687
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,720
environment and using his dissatisfaction as cause to move the conversation down a more

688
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:43,200
graphic road, basically it's not provocative enough so he can't pop a boner, if the old

689
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,960
video of him talking about how horny he was wasn't enough admission that his intention

690
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:53,920
for gathering these videos is quite clear this person was 14 years old, 14, it's perverted,

691
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,080
it's messed up, it's enraging.

692
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:59,880
In Victor May's case, there were multiple videos in which the person revealed their

693
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:04,280
private parts and declared their age, out of the constant lingering fear that they were

694
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:10,400
somewhat obliged to this cretin, in case he went and found anyone else because he inadvertently

695
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,760
degraded people by holding his power over them, which basically made them feel like

696
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:19,760
they had to do these things to please him, and the continual self-reference to age shows

697
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,760
that this was where Austin's preferences lay.

698
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:27,880
Austin wasn't just targeting fans who happened to be 14, he was specifically targeting 14

699
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,880
year olds.

700
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:35,800
Which leads us to our next case, Victim B. Victim B is a lot like Victim A, 14, but Austin

701
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,200
wouldn't have you believe that.

702
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,920
He once again dances into the DMs, acting like it's an honour that this person has

703
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,260
been blessed by his presence.

704
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:47,520
He really shouldn't be doing this, you know, the Vagabond.

705
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,600
Jones tells her how lucky she is, she says how much of a fan she is.

706
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:55,040
Jones tells her that she'll have to keep proving she's his biggest fan if he wants

707
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,520
to win the Austin Jones lottery and have a chance of sucking his dick.

708
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,040
Apparently sucking dick is correlated to being a fan of people, I'm a fan of a lot of people

709
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,040
then.

710
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,700
And this usual stick ensued, she didn't want to do it, Jones called into question

711
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:14,040
her official status as his biggest fan, and used it as blackmail into making this mind

712
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:18,720
objectify themselves and perform acts to satisfy the rocket in his pocket.

713
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,320
And that's what's most uncomfortable, it's how he continues to speak to her in

714
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:27,600
this juvenile way, acknowledging she's a child, through this condescending tone, go

715
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:34,080
on, you can do it, shake that ass, wow, you get 10 gold stars, that's so funny and wacky.

716
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:38,600
You can see it all here, I'll link it in the pinned comment if you're still interested.

717
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:44,400
Jones continuously pressures this person because he can't see their anus, and I feel unclean

718
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,020
just saying that.

719
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:51,940
The continuous cycle, and I mean some of the quotes speak for themselves, apparently that's

720
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:55,500
a sign of caring now, how lucky she is.

721
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:00,580
And the further reports just speak for themselves, it is legitimately repulsive, and it's quite

722
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:06,940
sensational that someone would really squander all that talent for a few predatory kicks.

723
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:11,520
And let's be clear, Austin Jones positioned himself in a place where he could do this,

724
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,540
but it's clear it comes from a place where he lacks self control, because no one with

725
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:20,300
any level of restraint, regardless of their twisted desires, throws away an unbelievably

726
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,460
successful career for jail time.

727
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:26,900
He clearly had the worst combination of determination and arrogance.

728
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:31,220
He's not necessarily stupid, he's clearly good at manipulating his environments in the

729
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:36,060
moment, but he clearly values the protection that his industry provides far too much as

730
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:40,740
this sort of get out of jail free card, but when you turn into a liability, they'll be

731
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,980
the first ones to throw you under the bus.

732
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:46,980
And honestly, I wouldn't mind the bus reversing back over you after what you've done to

733
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:47,980
these poor people.

734
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:53,500
And it should have been clear that he couldn't control himself after the run of exposed content.

735
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:57,340
When I first heard about this incident, I thought to myself, what an absolute tool.

736
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:01,820
Imagine having all of that influence and pursuing 14 year olds, but it should be clear that

737
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:06,300
their age was part of the appeal, and he thought his power could negate anything that came

738
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,300
his way.

739
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:12,020
Fortunately, it didn't, and justice has finally been served, it's hard to look into

740
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:16,660
a person's mind and understand exactly what they were thinking during the incident, however

741
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:21,660
Jones' borderline sociopathic exploitation of power should say more than enough about

742
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:23,620
the sentencing that he deserves.

743
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:29,260
This was cold, cruel, and calculated, and he needs to take a nice long trip to the slammer,

744
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:36,220
and with that in mind, I would like to wrap this all up finally.

745
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:39,420
Some people have to go, and Austin Jones was one of them.

746
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:44,860
He had proved himself not capable of handling power, and people even gave him a second chance,

747
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:47,980
whether they actually knew it or not, and he threw it away.

748
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:52,720
He was a nasty person who had dangerous desires, and clearly chose not to control them.

749
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,660
And second time around, he couldn't hide behind the quote hard times argument, he knew

750
00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:01,140
what he was doing, he may be an idiot in some ways, but it's clearly not a Jekyll and Hyde

751
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:02,140
situation.

752
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:06,660
Eventually YouTube did remove his channel, at first they declined to do it, saying that

753
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:11,220
it wasn't attached to the instance enough, and although I do feel strongly in some instances

754
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:15,340
about separating the art from the artist, and I want to make it clear that I don't

755
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:19,340
think some criminals having YouTube channels is inherently destructive, and in fact, I'm

756
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:23,620
sure YouTube has helped some people move away from certain dangerous activities, but the

757
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:29,100
problem here is that his crimes are inextricably linked to the power that he has obtained through

758
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:34,060
YouTube, and if his sentence is shorter than we expect it to be for any reason, and he

759
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:37,380
comes back to YouTube, he can't have that opportunity.

760
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:41,780
Much of the footage I have found today can be found elsewhere, if you've found unique

761
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:46,860
enjoyment in his music, I can't take that away from you, I'd be a hypocrite if I tried

762
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:51,260
to, there are plenty of bad people who've made songs that I have an emotional connection

763
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:56,180
to and people could never take away from me, but at the same time, as talented as he is,

764
00:52:56,180 --> 00:53:00,940
I feel that he has proven himself not capable of personally handling that power, so it's

765
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:05,660
quite clear that he doesn't deserve his channel, nor his fanbase, nor anything associated

766
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:06,660
with it.

767
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:10,420
Hopefully his sentence will prevent that, but you can never make any guarantees.

768
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:14,300
And that's the thing with talented people, even if they do provide something that might

769
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:19,160
be considered irreplaceable in some aspects, it certainly doesn't overshadow the lives

770
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:23,500
they could ruin through their rather selfish actions, and that's one of the most disheartening

771
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:27,860
things about the industry, especially with regards to music, he'd done this terrible

772
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:32,560
thing and people welcomed him back, they looked at the evidence, the 2015 evidence,

773
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:36,420
they looked at it in the eye, and they were like, this is fine, I have no doubt that many

774
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:40,940
people were aware of his behaviour, but because they received some sort of benefit from his

775
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:45,900
presence, they decided that actually, it wasn't worth addressing, much more just easy to sweep

776
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,040
under the carpet.

777
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:51,340
On top of this, this led to people who actually called it out, being attacked and threatened

778
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:55,920
by individuals who clearly had a stake in Austin's success, alienating themselves

779
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:00,020
from the victims, and denying the severity of the scenarios themselves.

780
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:03,720
By telling them that he had chosen them to speak to out of everyone, and making them

781
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:08,780
feel quote special, Jones tended to make people feel like their incident with him was isolated,

782
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:13,160
and therefore many people would maybe dismiss it as him having a funny 5 minutes, or feel

783
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:18,120
reluctant to come forward as a sole witness to what he was doing, and this is why it initially

784
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:23,540
took so long to corroborate accounts, and actively took another person with actual respect

785
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:28,700
from the community to come forward, and even then he was doubted and attacked by an industry

786
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:33,300
that wanted to forgive someone who should have known better, and even if he was sorry,

787
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:37,080
he shouldn't have been doing any tours and meet and greets with minors at all.

788
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:41,580
It was unbelievable how many people felt it appropriate to place someone who quite clearly

789
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:46,260
had an instinctive attraction to a certain demographic in control of members of that

790
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:47,260
demographic.

791
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:51,220
It would be like hiring a nonce as a babysitter, it doesn't matter if they're repentant,

792
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:55,060
you still shouldn't actively leave them in the vicinity of something that activates

793
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,060
their instincts.

794
00:54:56,060 --> 00:55:00,740
A high majority of young people are vulnerable, whether they're 4 or 14, because they haven't

795
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:02,380
reached the peak of decision making.

796
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:06,340
I'm far from the person I was when I was 14, and I'm thankful that I wasn't really

797
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:11,080
invested in the internet the same way I am today, because honestly I'm not quite sure

798
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,780
how I would have coped with it.

799
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:17,060
It's hard to put these sorts of crimes on the spectrum, because anything involving exploitation

800
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:22,180
of minors is absolutely horrific, but as the listing of such photos goes, this is definitely

801
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:27,620
one of the worst cases, predominantly because he completely wages that power in an absolutely

802
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:31,720
obscene manner, readily ruining these people's lives for a quick kick.

803
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:36,140
You have to make sure that you do not become attached to people like Austin Jones, however

804
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:40,640
unlike the Bud-day, Austin Jones could be considered attractive in some fashions, and

805
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,340
on top of the fact that he was also talented, this gave him immense power over his fans.

806
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:49,860
As fans, it's so important to realise that having your own identity is more important

807
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,900
than mindlessly indoctrinating yourself in an idol.

808
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,820
Am I saying that you shouldn't have idols?

809
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:59,260
Of course not, feel free to go and love whoever you want to love, especially if it's me.

810
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:03,700
What I'm saying is that you have to be critical, and that's dangerous when you look at some

811
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:08,340
of these stans, they would give up their organs for some of the people they support, and when

812
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:13,660
you tie yourself to something so unconditionally, you open yourself up to exploitation, because

813
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:16,960
they know they can do anything and you'll remain loyal.

814
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:21,860
It's always about being able to take a step back and calling them out, about being able

815
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:25,720
to see someone like Austin's actions for what they are.

816
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:30,660
Eventually people did see it in Austin's case, and thanks to social media and actual records,

817
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:34,700
people managed to properly bring these cases forward, and hopefully it won't be too long

818
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:38,740
until he's serving some real jail time and isn't a danger to anyone else.

819
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:42,300
Unfortunately, this could and should have been dealt with earlier, and there are people

820
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:43,860
who are responsible for that.

821
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:49,080
The story of Austin Jones is a story of manipulation in many ways, I want to make it abundantly

822
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:53,780
clear that a lot of the techniques that he used in his videos are the exact same techniques

823
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:57,540
that might be used by people with genuine intent to convey a message.

824
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:01,700
There are many people who sit down and explain their actions in an honest manner, however

825
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:06,220
in the context of the situation, it becomes quite clear that what he said was not the

826
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:10,880
truth, and even if it was, he clearly consciously used it as an excuse rather than actually

827
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,260
believing it as a sincere retrospective analysis of his actions.

828
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:20,120
He doesn't have the capacity to be sincere, you have to pay close attention and extract

829
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:24,580
the facts in these situations, dealing with serious allegations here there isn't room

830
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:29,720
for leverage, and people should have identified that when the DMs originally surfaced, that

831
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:34,000
he was transparently taking advantage of people, suggesting that they weren't his biggest

832
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,520
fan for not twerking for them, that's not fun in games, people seem to overlook how

833
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:42,800
genuinely disgusting a lot of his language was, and how that should have indicated that

834
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:48,040
he was a nasty nasty cretin, even with what he was demanding, I hope he goes away for

835
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,200
a very long time.

836
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:57,140
It's clear that he has failed to learn from what he likes to call his mistakes.

837
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,280
What are your thoughts on the situation?

838
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,520
