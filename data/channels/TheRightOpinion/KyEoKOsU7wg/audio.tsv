220000	224000	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time, and covering drama.
224000	228000	Isn't it just the most fun pastime to talk about? Well, not always,
228000	232000	but as people online have grown more invested in the escapades of creators, coverage is inevitable.
232000	236000	At the same time, reporting can take many different forms, and over the years,
236000	240000	each audience niche has gradually been filled by their corresponding correspondence,
240000	244000	whether that's to do with breaking the news as it happens with an emphatic tone,
244000	248000	or analysing the intricacies of a situation through a more retrospective perspective.
248000	252000	What matters to people is that they have a voice relaying to them what's going on in the world,
252000	256000	and that voice is at least somewhat reliable. From there, they can construct their own hot takes
256000	260000	to share it as social media accounts that permeate their relative platforms.
260000	264000	A lot of content is typically very organised, with attention to production value and a clear structure,
264000	268000	even if it may not be the most high-brow. However, this sort of content, my sort of content even,
268000	272000	can also have its disadvantages. It can feel quite distant to some viewers,
272000	276000	and if that audience can't connect to a creator, then they may not feel an interest in the topic
276000	280000	that they're talking about. Sometimes, organisation is unattractive,
280000	284000	as much as it pains me to admit. In those cases, viewers may find solace in a creator
284000	288000	with a more casual approach to talking about drama, one that reacts to it in an unedited
288000	292000	and unrestrained way. The reflexes are an innate human reaction to the discovery
292000	296000	of revelations about certain shenanigans, and that's the genre where the person
296000	300000	at the centre of today's video thrived, a person by the name of Creepshow Art.
300000	306000	If there's anyone who's ever confused at what I did, I will explain it to them.
306000	311000	Because if I fuck up, and I say something that is shown to be false, I don't want to hide from that.
311000	316000	I want to state it outright, and I want you guys to know, because I wouldn't be able to learn otherwise.
316000	319000	You can't hold me accountable otherwise.
319000	324000	Creepshow Art, or Shannon, is, or was, a creator who specialised in this sort of what was described
324000	329000	as a one-person podcast. Basically, she'd sit down, she'd have a topic in her mind, she'd pull out
329000	334000	the iPad Pro, the pencil, and the programme, and get to work, or promote another artist's work,
334000	338000	all while speaking her mind on the freshest drama available. Sometimes this would be trending topics,
338000	342000	but it could also lean into storytime aspects, where she would talk about her past experiences,
342000	345000	or even her own participation in ongoing conflicts.
345000	350000	I had people trying to expose me from it. I had people say they were going to extort money from me.
350000	356000	I was getting brands who had worked with, and been harassed by, Lily Jean in my DMs, and in my emails,
356000	361000	telling me their stories, telling me private shit, telling me things that I should know, telling me that
361000	366000	her mother had harassed them for months, was getting people who had simply talked to her in the DMs.
366000	368000	Shit was going off, shit was going bonkers.
368000	372000	I'm sure it's no surprise to anyone that someone like me didn't really connect with this content,
372000	376000	but at the same time, a lot of people did, this idea of a creator just going off with no filters.
376000	380000	It provides this impression that she's quote real, and that you're hearing how someone genuinely feels,
380000	382000	rather than a video catered to the viewer's sensibilities.
382000	385000	There's also just a lot of appeal to the gossip side of Shannon's videos.
385000	389000	Plenty of us have had our run-ins with other creators, and have feelings that we will likely never talk about,
389000	392000	because we consider that sort of thing unprofessional to our brand.
392000	397000	However, Shannon seldom showed restraint when telling you the tea about remarks made by other YouTubers,
397000	400000	or her own unsavoury experiences with the worst of what this platform has to offer.
400000	403000	It was a much more personal project than the typical drama reporters,
403000	408000	and with that came a devoted, albeit opinionated, fanbase who often had something to say.
408000	412000	For many it was incredibly digestible, it was very easy to put it on the background while you did art,
412000	417000	took a shower, or went to sleep. Sometimes you just need a creator where you don't have to care about everything they say,
417000	419000	even if they're a bit problematic here and there.
419000	425000	Although she launched her channel in 2016, you'd be hard pressed to find any record of her content before late 2018,
425000	428000	when her videos began to garner traction with a wider patronage.
428000	432000	As her channel grew, it became apparent that the most successful topics were the ones that typically covered
432000	437000	controversial individuals and their antics, ranging from petty art thieves to, well, Onision.
437000	441000	Her Stanny was bolstered by a fairly robust relationship with other creators in the commentary and art community,
441000	447000	alongside her seemingly professional conduct towards those around her, which is normally half the job when it comes to personal image.
447000	451000	She'd regularly speak about her own story, as a person who started their channel when they were homeless,
451000	456000	and had drafted their way to a position of self-sufficiency, it was a very noble rise to the top,
456000	458000	and one that many found inspiring.
458000	463000	Nevertheless, when you seemingly present such a personal image of yourself online, there is a trust invested
463000	468000	that charges you with the responsibility to at least have some morals that are consistent with the values you expound.
468000	472000	When Sharon presented herself, people wanted to believe that they were receiving a person who, whether perfect or not,
472000	478000	believed in doing the right thing, and valued bringing the subjects of her videos to justice that was proportional to their misdeeds.
478000	507000	In many ways she had tied that personal side of her to the philosophy that she advocated for, which made her work online even more sacred to her viewers.
507000	513000	That was also entrenched by the slightly slapdash presentation, it wasn't a hard-hitting expose, but it felt like it came from the heart.
513000	518000	Shannon was a person who wore that heart on her sleeve, and people felt they could trust her for it.
518000	524000	However, throughout the year 2020, a few points of pressure began to be applied, some that she emerged fairly unscathed from,
524000	528000	and others that left a bit of a stain, and manifested some skepticism within viewers.
528000	533000	However, even with this said, few would have been able to predict the sudden escalation of events in 2021,
534000	540000	with a series of very bizarre situations which focused on incognito behaviour that seemed to deconstruct everything she stood for,
540000	544000	supported by a testimony from a creator that has accumulated over 4 million views.
544000	549000	What did this behaviour entail exactly? Well, some of you probably already know, some of you are likely in the dark,
549000	555000	however I'm sure you're all equally curious to know exactly where this started, and where this ends, if it does.
555000	561000	So join me and a couple friends today as we take a journey through this drama in a video that hopefully won't exceed two hours,
561000	567000	so I make myself no promises. How much of someone can truly be real, how much can be fabricated,
567000	572000	and how much can we expect from a creator's persona? Well, let's find out.
578000	583000	I think it's difficult when you grow as a creator to maintain everything good about your channel,
583000	586000	while evolving other aspects that could require improvement. When your content progresses,
586000	591000	you'll inevitably have people who pick up on the changes that it undergoes. A lot of the time it's pretty subjective,
591000	595000	some people may not like a creator decision or a new direction, but a lot of people may prefer it,
595000	599000	and it comes down to a point of personal taste. In other cases, there may not even be a problem,
599000	604000	and people just think that you've changed when in reality you haven't. On the other hand, there may be some valid criticisms,
604000	611000	whether they've emerged as a product of your own channel's changes, or they're just continuous flaws that have become more apparent as more people tune in.
611000	616000	So let's go to 2020, when Shannon was encountering some pretty impressive growth, covering a variety of unsavoury characters
616000	621000	who had found themselves in Broadway and drama for various reasons. Overall, I think that many people were happy
621000	626000	that she was talking about these subjects, however the focus of uploads had definitely pivoted more towards degeneracy,
626000	631000	and that can often alter the perspective of your content when you deal with fresh allegations, especially if you've just covered
631000	637000	something extremely serious, or anything to do with Jeffree Star. She did have some problems relating to her own impulsive behaviour
637000	641000	that seemed to fall short of some people's standards for reliable content.
641000	647000	I am literally sitting here telling you to your face that the man who provided the semen to make one of the most
647000	654000	prophetic and profitable liars on YouTube has a LinkedIn page where he says his current job is that he is God.
654000	662000	His job is that he's God. He's just God, which is a completely fine and normal thing to put on a resume, on LinkedIn, anywhere.
662000	667000	As I've noticed, Group Show Art's style was pretty informal, and that style clearly resonated with a lot of viewers,
667000	672000	however the problem with reacting to drama on a cursory basis is that you're working with information as you perceive it,
672000	678000	rather than a well researched, laid out set of events that you can document with clarity. Some may argue that it's part of the spontaneous
678000	684000	charm that sort of content has, but as awareness for your channel rises, idiosyncrasy can only really justify the aspects
684000	690000	that one views as subjective, and informational vigour did not always seem to be one of them, especially given how she'd often
690000	692000	shared information that she had found. For example,
692000	699000	So this video is probably going to be a little bit controversial. I mean, I am talking about something that has yet to be proven
699000	706000	beyond a reasonable doubt, and people are already stating things like, to even question someone about this is in fact ableist.
706000	711000	So me making this video is probably going to get me into a little bit of hot water.
711000	717000	In this fabulous deleted video, after reading an obviously very compelling Instagram post, she wrote the rather contentious idea
717000	722000	that actress Jameela Jamil has been dishonest about the disabilities she has discussed in her past.
722000	727000	What was the evidence for this? Well, supposedly contradictory statements about her health that didn't add up.
727000	734000	From that very weird scenario, she got a load of weird food allergies with that poisoning, and after she healed completely
734000	739000	from that, those allergies cleared up. So if you're following her stating here,
739000	744000	I have loads of food allergies. I was born allergic to shellfish and peanuts.
744000	748000	That she's been allergic to peanuts since she was born was her lying.
748000	753000	She was just lying right there because she just wanted to lie, I guess.
753000	759000	And the truth is actually more convoluted because it involves mercury poisoning, and now she can eat peanuts again.
759000	766000	It's a lot to take in, but for me, the main point of this is to note that despite her stating that these claims that she has lied about anything,
766000	772000	that she's lied about anything she's ever said, and her saying that everyone who has ever said something negative about her,
772000	778000	some kind of bullshit artist, kind of, sort of unravels when you realise that, hey, hi, hello,
778000	786000	this explanation only works if you also admit to lying in various interviews a consistent amount of time for no clear reason.
786000	790000	I'm going to be clear about this video. It's not necessarily an endorsement of the allegations.
790000	794000	In fact, she outwardly states she does not endorse them. However, it conducts some rather poor,
794000	797000	deductive reasoning that could lead people to a biased conclusion.
797000	801000	Lack of research on fine details like the one in the clips shown above are what highlights this.
801000	807000	The tweet that Jameela is responding to here is not with regards to a specific peanut allergy which she claims to have possessed at birth.
807000	812000	They were in reference to a wide range of food allergies she claimed to have experienced at some point in her life.
812000	816000	Therefore, although I could understand some uncertainty, they're not directly contradictory.
816000	822000	Even the video that Sharon uses as a reference seems to support Jameela in the fact that she had other post-birth allergies.
822000	824000	Peanuts just wasn't one of them.
824000	830000	I'm not a big Jameela Jamil fan. I don't think there's anything wrong with clearing up confusion surrounding interviews and inconsistencies.
830000	832000	I don't think her response was sublime.
832000	837000	But it's hard to really be mad at someone for that sort of response when it was provoked by such a slanted post.
837000	843000	I believe she has EDS, a disease that has a lot of complications, and one that too many people are accused of falsifying.
843000	850000	Suggesting she add montaussins is pretty damn distasteful, and to tie that to EDS like some did was not just attacking her,
850000	852000	but perpetuating a harmful stereotype.
852000	859000	Anyone who finds inconsistencies and immediately rushes to imply that a person is faking it is pushing their luck and assuming too much.
859000	864000	And those who propounded this theory were rather quickly forced on the retreats, creepshow aren't included,
864000	868000	with the video being promptly unlisted, because she can be a little too gun ho.
868000	873000	But a lot of the time, given Sharon's style, it was hard to place blame for any misinformation at her doorstep.
873000	878000	Her reaction to evidence was just like anyone else's, even if this means that some of her videos haven't aged that well.
878000	881000	Hell, that's a characteristic universal to many creators.
881000	885000	However, she had also called out creators for deceiving their audiences, such as Blaire White,
885000	888000	so it was important that she held herself to the same standard.
888000	892000	As the year proceeded, however, the red flags only appeared to increase in number,
892000	895000	not just in her research, but in her demeanor.
895000	897000	Now, I want you guys to look at this image.
897000	899000	Look at it really hard.
899000	902000	Squint your fucking eyes till they bleed, looking at this image.
902000	907000	And I want you, in your mind-brain, to focus on what you think the issue here is.
907000	913000	If you stated that you literally cannot tell if this image was made with racist motivations towards Leslie Jones,
913000	915000	then you are absolutely right.
915000	922000	So the fact that she is drawn in this way, and is the only character in this image shown to have fucking lips,
922000	925000	it feels purposeful, and in a not-so-great way.
925000	928000	It feels like it was done in malice.
928000	931000	First of all, Sharon appeared to be quite flippant.
931000	937000	We know she'd occasionally construct her videos off sentiments that may not be substantiated with the proper research you'd expect of a creator,
937000	941000	but her attitude seemed to carry much more confidence than the foundations the content was rooted in,
941000	947000	whether it was an artist that drew characters she had deemed racist, even if they'd apologized, or a creator family member's antics.
947000	951000	Jimbles over here is a bonafide cult leader.
951000	953000	No, I am not saying that to be cute.
953000	956000	I'm not saying that to meme or prank you guys.
956000	965000	I am literally sitting here telling you to your face that the man who provided the semen to make one of the most prophetic and profitable liars on YouTube
965000	969000	has a LinkedIn page where he says his current job is that he is God.
969000	971000	His job is that he's God.
971000	978000	In this video posted in March 2020, she calls the missionary evangelist father of beauty creator Jacqueline Hill a cult leader.
978000	984000	Now, I'm not fond of evangelists, and in many ways, there is a case that the narratives they do perform could be seen as quite demagogic.
984000	992000	However, when we think of cults, we tend to have a very vivid image, and to frame someone as being a cult leader is risky wording.
992000	997000	Also, this man is the man who put his hoo-ha into someone else to make Jacqueline,
997000	1000000	so I guess we know where she learned how to boldface lie online,
1000000	1005000	so much so that she made an entire brand off it, and like him, they both made brands off this.
1005000	1010000	Jacqueline herself wasn't very amused by this, especially given how she unties it to Jacqueline,
1010000	1012000	even though she hadn't spoken to him in over a decade.
1012000	1016000	Now the video was removed, and that's fair enough, but given the more genetic connection,
1016000	1020000	what's even the point of making a video dishing dirt on a person's father?
1020000	1022000	What is the point?
1022000	1030000	I want to make it clear throughout this video that I was not the first one to make things public, I did not make things public, and they did this.
1030000	1035000	That's a question that some may begin to ask after watching a video on a person by the name of Karuna Satori.
1035000	1038000	Now, Karuna Satori is an ASMR YouTuber and former anti-vaxxer.
1038000	1045000	She engaged in a rather heated exchange with Shannon after she took issue with Creepshow Arts mocking of people who espouse anti-vax narratives.
1045000	1052000	We are going to be talking about all of the reasons why she thinks I'm scum, a bully, why I should learn where my place is,
1052000	1057000	and how very soon I'm going to lose everything I made on YouTube. Her words.
1057000	1066000	Oh, and also, she apparently thought I was a teenager, despite me constantly, constantly bringing up how I married and used to be homeless. Classic teen things.
1066000	1071000	Now I'm gonna come back to this situation in a bit, but all I'll say is that one comment left in a video over the next couple weeks
1071000	1077000	manifested into a 35 minute video documenting the situation and labelling Karuna the anti-vaxx defender.
1077000	1082000	And although I don't think the points she makes in the video are entirely unfounded, it's once again a question of why it exists,
1082000	1087000	a question that we'll answer very soon. Karuna was certainly oddly outspoken on certain matters that one would deem trivial,
1087000	1096000	she is a dramatic person. However, Shannon is as well, and whereas many YouTubers would probably dodge the bullet and move on with exposing whoever's next on their problematic list,
1096000	1104000	these minor situations seem to end up with a Creepshow art video, because she just often couldn't resist, de-escalation was not her forte.
1104000	1109000	I think one of the perks with casual content like Shannon's is that it didn't have to be high-stakes stuff all the time,
1109000	1117000	if I uploaded a video about my latest Twitter spat with some ASMR channel, you'd probably be all quite confused, even if I was right, like I always am, of course.
1117000	1124000	Nonetheless, even if you do make videos about the most trivial matters, you're still expected to operate by a set of tenets that most commentators follow quite closely,
1124000	1128000	however when content has less consequences, people pay less attention to when you fuck up.
1128000	1133000	So the examples we've listed today didn't really provoke ire from most viewers, and why would they?
1133000	1140000	A few mistakes here and there, it's not a big deal, but if you keep rolling the dice, you're gonna score a 7, and then you'll be in the crowd.
1155000	1160000	There are a lot of minor problems with Shannon's content that when combined, amounted to a more significant problem,
1160000	1164000	the fact that she would regularly be quite incendiary in her commentary, the fact that she wasn't always the most
1164000	1169000	scrupulous with her narratives, and the fact that she'd often take it to other social media platforms which rub salt on the wounds
1169000	1174000	of what may be erroneous reporting already, however these characteristics are not really noticeable on an individual basis.
1174000	1179000	You need a situation that combines all of these traits into one concerning conglomerate, so let's move to May 2020,
1179000	1182000	when a situation appeared to hit a lot closer to Shannon's home.
1182000	1185000	In days like these, I wake up and I'm excited to spill the tea.
1185000	1191000	Jake Yonsei is a creator who covers a lot of showbiz-style topics, including RuPaul's Drag Race, and the drama that surrounds it,
1191000	1197000	however in 2020, a movement began known as "#CancelJakeYonsei", on the basis that he had repeatedly used his platform
1197000	1201000	to disseminate defamatory content against competitors of the popular TV show in question.
1201000	1207000	It all transpired when one drag queen by the name of The Vixen implied that a product had racist undertones,
1207000	1211000	and Jake posted it onto his Instagram and asked about other people's thoughts.
1211000	1215000	Is this what causes drama now? Ok. Jesus.
1215000	1219000	Anyhow, this provoked The Vixen to go off on Twitter calling for Jake to be reported,
1219000	1223000	subsequently inspiring other people to share their unfavourable experiences with the YouTuber,
1223000	1228000	another tweet coming from a person who claimed he had been extremely jane of space towards him when covering a situation.
1228000	1233000	This was quote tweeted by another former contestant, Shay Kool-Aid, who championed the tweet, adding a further
1233000	1239000	"#CancelJakeYonsei hashtag onto the original post". This was not the only tweet Shay quote tweeted with this comment,
1239000	1243000	and not the only tweet on this matter, it seems they were just not happy with Jake in his videos.
1243000	1249000	Another contestant, Arielle Versace, also commented on the matter, having a rather heated exchange with a Jake Yonsei fan,
1249000	1253000	asserting that his content is a one-sided breeding ground for mob mentality.
1253000	1259000	A load of content followed within this movement, some of it has been lost to time, others not so much,
1259000	1264000	and this deepened the divisions between the two parties, and became rather nasty for everyone involved.
1264000	1268000	Kusha, appearing to be a friend of Jake, saw her comrade in a bit of a pickle,
1268000	1272000	and being the good friend that she was, decided to upload a video coming to his aid.
1272000	1277000	There is one thing that I know about me personally, is that I am a ride or die friend.
1277000	1281000	I am very loyal, I will stick up for my friends through thick and thin,
1281000	1285000	and there is literally nothing you can do or anyone can do to stop me from doing that.
1285000	1292000	I have gotten into actual fistfights with people over my friends, someone at one point tried to stab me because I was defending a friend,
1292000	1297000	and I just have lived a very long life where the only constant within myself is that,
1297000	1303000	if I love you, I will fight for you, and I don't care if the person is famous, I don't care if they have a bigger platform than me,
1303000	1305000	I will fight for you.
1305000	1308000	How honourable, I think a loyal friend is what we need sometimes,
1308000	1312000	though sometimes being a good friend is acknowledging when they're wrong and not just blindly defending them,
1312000	1317000	though I'm sure Shannon knew that, so she must have had some conviction in her defence of Jake, right?
1317000	1319000	Well, she certainly did.
1319000	1323000	He also goes out of his way to ask for multiple people's sides of the story,
1323000	1326000	so say there's a situation with two drag queens fighting,
1326000	1329000	he would ask both drag queens their opinion and then put it in a video,
1329000	1333000	take for example his video about Trinity The Tuck Taylor and James Charles,
1333000	1336000	he reached out to both of them for comment, both of them gave it,
1336000	1339000	and he sat back and said, what do you guys think about that?
1339000	1343000	Did he make that situation toxic? No, he simply talked about it.
1343000	1346000	Now most of the video is her arguing in favour of her embattled buddy,
1346000	1349000	she's talking about all the times he has supported the drag race community,
1349000	1352000	and explaining why the hatred against him was unjustified in convincing enough terms.
1352000	1356000	However, the tone of the video took a turn when the conduct of the queens who had called out Jake
1356000	1358000	were put under the microscope by Shannon.
1358000	1362000	After debunking some rather suspect screenshots, she moves on to the more sensitive subjects.
1362000	1367000	These messages were sex, from when Jake was between the ages of 15 to 17,
1367000	1372000	and these were leaked as part of a pace bin where images of him when he was less than legal
1372000	1374000	and not clothes were leaked as well.
1374000	1378000	Basically, what I am telling you right now, is what was posted was revenge porn.
1378000	1382000	His sex, his nudes, revenge porn was posted by, and then retweeted,
1382000	1386000	by Shea Couleé and Ariel Versace, two people with massive platforms,
1386000	1390000	and these were posted in direct response to them calling out Jake
1390000	1393000	and trying to spread hashtag cancel Jake Yonsei.
1393000	1396000	Now this is a very serious allegation, I understand that people can be petty,
1396000	1400000	but publicising someone's explicit content for when they're a minor is rather dangerous,
1400000	1403000	and certainly not anything that a public figure like Ariel should be indulging in,
1403000	1406000	and after Shannon's response, many in her YouTube comments pointed out
1406000	1409000	that what they did was not just inappropriate, but borderline criminal,
1409000	1412000	and it was questioned on whether they even deserved their platforms
1412000	1414000	if this is how they were going to use them.
1414000	1418000	Shannon also becomes very personal, claiming that the person who had promoted these allegations
1418000	1420000	had attempted to trigger them with self-harmed content.
1420000	1424000	This clearly affects Shannon, and she becomes rather emotional as well.
1424000	1428000	And by the way, just fun fact, the account that is sending out his nudes
1428000	1433000	is the same account that has sent me graphic images of gore and people cutting themselves
1433000	1437000	in order to trigger me to cut myself, because at one point I mentioned that.
1437000	1444000	The person doing this is someone online who really enjoys spreading falsehoods about YouTubers
1444000	1447000	and triggering them to do stuff like this, to hurt themselves,
1447000	1450000	and they're spreading this kid's revenge porn.
1450000	1453000	I don't know what the fuck is wrong with you people.
1453000	1459000	It's a powerful moment of one friend sticking up for another, demonstrating how much she truly cares.
1459000	1462000	But did she care enough to get the facts right?
1462000	1464000	I get if you don't like Jake.
1464000	1466000	I can understand not liking a person.
1466000	1468000	If you think he's too flamboyant, too much, that's fine.
1468000	1472000	You don't jive with his personality and his energy and his videos, and that is okay.
1472000	1475000	You don't like that he reports on stuff that you guys do,
1475000	1479000	because you are famous now, and you're public entities, and people can do that.
1479000	1483000	But what you're not going to do here is lie in order to make him look worse,
1483000	1485000	especially when you have this large platform.
1485000	1489000	Podcasts have become notorious for being this source of misinformation,
1489000	1492000	mainly because when you go on a podcast, you don't have a concrete plan
1492000	1495000	or a concrete script backed up with concrete research.
1495000	1499000	A lot of the time, it is just you reacting to the cues that you may be given,
1499000	1504000	and although that obviously has its quirks, I don't think spontaneity can always excuse lazy research,
1504000	1508000	and the truth is that there was still a level of organisation to Shannon's content,
1508000	1512000	just because it felt somewhat impromptu doesn't mean she doesn't go into it
1512000	1514000	with a clear plan of what she's actually talking about,
1514000	1517000	and in addressing the Jake Yonsei situation,
1517000	1519000	she clearly shows an awareness of the points she's making,
1519000	1522000	particularly against the drag queens in promoting, quote, revenge porn.
1522000	1526000	So how in relaying that information did she botch it up so miserably?
1526000	1528000	You don't think that's triggering?
1528000	1532000	You don't think the act of having your, like, your naked body sent to you
1532000	1536000	that was you when you were a minor, you don't think that would hurt someone?
1536000	1538000	You think that's fine. You think that's funny.
1538000	1542000	They were leaked as revenge porn by someone who was hurting him,
1542000	1544000	and that is sickening that you would do it. It's sick.
1544000	1546000	It is gross. God damn it.
1546000	1548000	And Ariel's a YouTuber. Ariel Versace on YouTube?
1548000	1550000	This is the quote tweet in question.
1550000	1552000	At this time, the original tweet had been removed,
1552000	1554000	however, its allegations were still accessible,
1554000	1558000	and you were still able to recover the original tweet through inputting the link in archives.
1558000	1560000	Now, I'd rather not show the content in question,
1560000	1563000	because I don't think it's central to the points that I'll be making,
1563000	1567000	but needless to say, although there are plenty of words I would use to describe it,
1567000	1571000	revenge porn is a bit misleading if you do not have the full context,
1571000	1574000	and saying images is really just false,
1574000	1577000	especially when you pair this with the idea that the language led some to believe
1577000	1581000	the original tweeter was sexually exploiting Jake for something they did as a minor.
1581000	1584000	There may have been vulnerable images that were part of a pastebin,
1584000	1586000	but this post was not related to that,
1586000	1590000	and given she had posted the original messages, I assume she saw the tweet in question.
1590000	1593000	Jake's own tweet on the pastebin matter was published before the drama,
1593000	1596000	and it's unclear how related these situations even were,
1596000	1598000	so let's clear this up.
1611000	1614000	The person contending these allegations in the specific comment
1614000	1617000	was using the screenshots as evidence to support their experience,
1618000	1621000	as a person judging a context, and in an elevated position,
1621000	1624000	supposedly took advantage of them during a drag competition that they were competing in.
1624000	1627000	They were both 17 at the time, and the evidence that is shown
1627000	1629000	refers to a sexual conversation that they had.
1629000	1633000	Now, I don't think it was necessary at all to post sex between two underage individuals,
1633000	1635000	in fact, I think it was foolish as all hell,
1635000	1640000	but they were clearly trying to use the evidence to prove that Jake was a bad person and the rest.
1640000	1643000	If a 17 year old did something terrible to another person, especially another minor,
1643000	1646000	they wouldn't suddenly become a victim because they were a minor,
1646000	1650000	and a traumatised person may be irrational in handling that sort of content.
1650000	1655000	With that said, I think the allegations lack the context that is needed to even begin to assess the situation.
1655000	1658000	The person advocating them is not the original person alleging them,
1658000	1663000	I think the problem with the evidence is that it does not support the idea that he's taking advantage of anyone,
1663000	1665000	just that there was an interaction between the two,
1665000	1668000	which is definitely assuaged by the fact that the two were the same age.
1668000	1672000	There's no other context or evidence, and it's very hard to do anything with the other tweets in the thread as well.
1672000	1677000	I think the drag queens were exceptionally irresponsible to promote the content given their expansive audience.
1677000	1681000	I understand the gay community is a bit catty, but you can't just look at something uncritically
1681000	1686000	because it's about someone you don't like, especially something so strong, that's reprehensible.
1686000	1690000	However, when the crime is misinformation, you should not fight fire with fire.
1690000	1693000	When in the screenshots I have of it, over 500 people saw it,
1693000	1697000	over 500 people liked it, and you're not going to clarify that that was fake,
1697000	1702000	and you're not going to spread the sex and nudes of a minor in order to make yourself better.
1702000	1705000	I looked up to you people, how the fuck is this okay?
1705000	1709000	There was a conflation of what was going on, and although it seems that someone may have leaked nudes,
1709000	1712000	that was not to do with the tweet or the situation in question,
1712000	1715000	and the tweets that the drag queens promoted did not either,
1715000	1718000	and as some people in Creepshow's YouTube comments noted, if they had,
1718000	1723000	this could be seen as disseminating underage nudes, which in many cases is considered illegal.
1723000	1726000	I don't know what the fuck is wrong with you people.
1726000	1730000	Additionally, with the context of this account isn't the actual person who's claiming the situation happened to them,
1730000	1735000	this emotional moment in Shannon's video doesn't really feel completely warranted.
1735000	1740000	This twitter user could be an awful person, that doesn't have a bearing on the verity of allegations
1740000	1743000	if the person is not associated with the allegations otherwise,
1743000	1747000	all they've done is repost it with the attempt to draw publicity to it.
1747000	1751000	These points were made by critics, and once the drag queens mentioned caught wind of it, it all kicked off.
1751000	1756000	Ariel Versace in particular was quite vocal that they had retained a lawyer, promising legal action.
1756000	1760000	This of course provoked the nuclear response from Shannon, who basically said bring it on.
1760000	1766000	After all, if showing tweets of a public figure promoting a minor sex is all she did, then she did nothing wrong at all.
1766000	1771000	The problem is that this just wasn't the case, and the fact that she wasn't prepared to concede on this only heightened the drama.
1771000	1777000	Both parties win the wrong, let's make no mistake here, because one of them is a commentator, the attention swung towards her,
1777000	1782000	and it was a real shame in that sense, because you could still call the drag queens out in my opinion as public figures,
1782000	1787000	but it had been overshadowed by this other allegation and further drama that to be honest, was not justified.
1787000	1793000	Many people took Shannon's word as gospel and echoed it over the following weeks, which often caused more harm than good,
1793000	1798000	and instead of working towards any sort of resolution, we were left with this mess of a situation which would have been avoided
1798000	1803000	if someone had merely taken the high road, however unlike previous situations, this one didn't die.
1803000	1809000	Yes, given that these people can't keep their Twitter fingers still, it proceeded to bounce back and forth on social media,
1809000	1812000	and discussion quickly became this very partisan war of words.
1812000	1819000	It wasn't long until other commentators with a bit more proximity to the situation picked it up, appearing to garner this very gradual ripple effect
1819000	1823000	over the following month as people seemed to observe the problems with creepshow art.
1824000	1829000	Yes, the thread does include screenshots of a private Snapchat conversation.
1829000	1836000	I don't think that was necessary, I don't think that was necessarily a good thing to include, I don't think it was needed,
1836000	1846000	but there was absolutely no nudes in there, there was no child porn or revenge porn in that thread that she uses.
1846000	1851000	A few smaller creators covered the topic, some of which focused on the specific drag queen situation,
1851000	1856000	however eventually it wasn't long before her videos were viewed through a greater lens, and the incidents earlier on in the year
1856000	1862000	that perhaps were viewed as inconsequential at the time were now seen as part of a bigger picture with regards to her antics.
1862000	1867000	Just over a month after the initial situation, this ultimately culminated in a marginally more popular video
1867000	1871000	from a YouTuber by the name of Toby, a person who I would describe as a ranch YouTuber,
1871000	1877000	but also a former viewer and subscriber of Shannon, who hypothesized that she had become more negative in the months preceding,
1877000	1880000	and that this had manifested in the content that she produced.
1880000	1886000	So with this slightly lengthy video, we'll be looking at the very talented creep show art,
1886000	1890000	and dive into why this creator, with humble beginnings and a very charitable heart,
1890000	1895000	has of the past three months has turned into somebody who makes a 35 minute video over petty comments,
1895000	1899000	makes false accusations about somebody distributing child pornography,
1899000	1905000	as well as crossing a line and going too far, not knowing when to stop, and reacts before thinking.
1905000	1908000	This is where the situations of the last few months come to a head,
1908000	1912000	this narrative that her expanding influence had altered her approach to creating content,
1912000	1915000	and that this ultimately escalated in the drag queen shenanigans.
1915000	1918000	And so now we're brought to this tweet right here,
1918000	1924000	where Lewis goes on to explain the fact that Creepshow has completely and utterly falsely accused two drag queens,
1924000	1929000	two very known celebrity drag queens, of spreading around child pornography falsely,
1929000	1933000	and then Shannon ends up responding saying,
1933000	1937000	I literally said they spread sexts that he sent as a minor, because they did.
1937000	1940000	As those tweets are still up, literally fact check me right now,
1940000	1943000	is what was posted was revenge porn.
1943000	1947000	His sex, his nudes, revenge porn was posted by, and then retweeted by,
1947000	1951000	Shea Couleé and Ariel Versace, two people with massive platforms.
1951000	1955000	And these were posted in direct response to them calling out Drake,
1955000	1957000	and trying to spread hashtag cancel Jake Yonsei.
1957000	1962000	Shea Couleé and Ariel Versace, two people who are successful in their field,
1962000	1966000	and are massively talented, like they're very talented, very gifted performers,
1966000	1970000	who have large audience, who don't like Jake, for whatever reason,
1970000	1975000	that they are allowed to not like Jake, decided that they were going to repost to their large audience
1975000	1979000	these images, this revenge porn, to embarrass and hurt this fucking 19 year old.
1979000	1983000	However, the video covered a variety of situations, some of which we've already discussed,
1983000	1986000	and others that she felt had struck a bit more of a personal chord,
1986000	1990000	merging them together to outline what many labelled the pattern of behaviour.
1990000	1993000	Now this term is typically used to strike fear into a viewer,
1993000	1997000	but in this case, Shannon just had a few problems that continued to surface in her content,
1997000	2001000	and unless she sorted herself out, these problems weren't going to magically evaporate.
2001000	2005000	Given that Tobi could definitely convey a rather irate tone through their content,
2005000	2010000	it allowed them to inject emotionality into situations that perhaps didn't carry the greatest consequence initially,
2010000	2012000	and thus make people take more notice.
2012000	2016000	The video itself was a follow up to another video where Tobi had expressed qualms with Shannon's content,
2016000	2019000	but whereas the previous upload hadn't reached too many people,
2019000	2023000	hundreds of thousands tuned in to see all of Creepshow's blunders under inspection,
2023000	2028000	with many chiming in to say how they felt she had become a more negative force of reason.
2028000	2031000	Now, I don't think that prognosis was completely fair,
2031000	2033000	a lot of commentary creators typically talk about other people,
2033000	2038000	especially those who may have committed misconduct, which often makes the perspective of their videos more negative.
2038000	2042000	However, I think it was the fact that sometimes that negativity didn't seem validated,
2042000	2046000	it was EDGE without purpose, and if she was going to continue to make the same mistakes,
2046000	2051000	with possibly legal ramifications, then what reason was there for her existence as a creator?
2051000	2055000	Well, let's dive into Tobi's video and find out.
2055000	2059000	Tobi's video was a follow up to another video where Tobi had expressed qualms with Shannon's content,
2059000	2062000	which often makes the perspective of their videos more negative.
2062000	2065000	However, it was a follow up to another video where Tobi had expressed qualms with Shannon's content,
2065000	2067000	which often makes the perspective of their videos more negative.
2067000	2072000	Remember that girl who was living out of her car with little to no resources to make videos?
2072000	2079000	Remember what you did, what you had to do in order to get by with a $2 pen and a fucking sketchbook from Walmart?
2079000	2084000	I don't know where the hell she went, because all I see now is somebody who does no research.
2084000	2089000	Are we going to continue to insult them, or are we going to try to educate and make them understand
2089000	2094000	that not vaccinating your kids is wrong, it's a wrong thing to do?
2094000	2097000	It gets extremely defensive to people who don't agree with her,
2097000	2105000	it makes really petty tweets from a petty situation as her Twitter banner, like a 12 year old would do.
2105000	2110000	Tobi's now removed video in particular prompted more publicity than previous uploads on The Predicament,
2110000	2114000	and when a video like that begins to garner traction, many creators would feel naturally compelled to address it,
2114000	2118000	especially if they have a case to make for themselves, and in this instance, Shannon certainly did.
2118000	2122000	Additionally, as a creator who makes videos on a highly regular basis calling people out,
2122000	2125000	it felt like she couldn't really afford to ignore a video like this.
2125000	2127000	If she's going to make videos on what YouTuber's fathers are doing,
2127000	2131000	then she could at least dedicate a quarter of an hour to a video that isn't the hardest to respond to.
2131000	2139000	Hey guys, it's Shannon, and today I'm going to be responding to a video that was made about me by the creator named Tobi, that's T-O-B-I.
2139000	2145000	I'll make it clear, Tobi's video was not completely accurate in its portrayal of events and how they reflected on Shannon's behaviour.
2145000	2150000	Now, I'll go into the particularities of this in a moment, but when someone espouses misinformation themselves and it becomes
2150000	2154000	a dominant narrative in discourse, then it's fairly natural to feel inclined to correct it.
2154000	2159000	At the same time, it's also important that you're not just seen as completely ignoring possible flaws that may be present in your content.
2159000	2166000	So a few days after Tobi's video began to hit people's recommended page, Shannon published a 17 minute response to the original post.
2166000	2167000	How would she handle it?
2167000	2171000	There is a lot of criticism given in this video, and there's a lot of things that I do in fact agree with,
2171000	2175000	as well as a lot of things that I feel like were accidentally misrepresented,
2175000	2182000	and I want to touch on all of it without being defensive or trying to make excuses for anything that I have done or said that isn't productive.
2182000	2187000	Because I want to be productive in this video, I want to take accountability where I need to take accountability,
2187000	2190000	and I want to give context where context is needed.
2190000	2192000	So with that being said, let's get into everything.
2193000	2197000	I mean, tonally it hits all the right notes, she presents herself as forthright without being overly defensive,
2197000	2201000	and she does take accountability for some of her errors, such as that in the Drag Queen drama,
2201000	2206000	which although I wish she hadn't gone out of her way to explain why she was technically still right, is appreciated nonetheless.
2223000	2229000	However, she makes a decision to stand her ground on a fair few issues, which although I may disagree with, I can also respect.
2229000	2233000	We all possess different principles for what we believe is the correct approach towards content,
2233000	2239000	and as long as we don't feel that attitude causes excess harm towards others, then there can generally be a degree of mutual understanding.
2239000	2243000	All the same though, when standing up for oneself, it's rather important that you don't mislead your viewers,
2243000	2247000	as it could be seen as you misrepresenting information to make your actions seem more reasonable.
2247000	2251000	These could be on minor details such as that relating to the Jaclyn Hill situation,
2251000	2255000	where she claims that she thought that her coverage was kosher on the basis that other people were reporting on it,
2255000	2258000	and the fact that Jaclyn had spoken about it previously.
2258000	2265000	The reason I felt comfortable making that video is because both Jaclyn and her father are public figures who work in the public arena.
2265000	2272000	Had Jaclyn's father just been an average guy who keeps a low profile and doesn't have a website dedicated to how he can heal the sick and impoverished,
2272000	2277000	but because both people are in fact public entities who have already been talked about by other YouTubers,
2277000	2280000	I felt comfortable in talking about it.
2280000	2286000	Even Jaclyn herself had previously talked about the trip she would take to South Africa with her family as a part of his job,
2286000	2291000	so for me, personally, I didn't feel like it crossed any lines, and that's why the video is still up today.
2291000	2294000	I can't speak with absolute conviction to the verity of this claim,
2294000	2298000	however all records of comments relating back to Jaclyn Hill's father being a cult leader,
2299000	2305000	and most comments about Jaclyn Hill's father at all, stop at around March 4th, when Shannon released her video,
2305000	2307000	and I struggled to find any other popular videos on the matter.
2307000	2311000	In fact, many of the larger tea channels agreed with Jaclyn that the video was in poor taste,
2311000	2316000	as well as feeding the surf to distract from the valid criticism the beauty YouTuber was receiving at the time.
2316000	2321000	On top of this, the fact that Jaclyn had mentioned her estranged father is no validation for making an entire video,
2321000	2325000	unless she dedicated enough attention towards him to really justify it.
2325000	2329000	He's not a prominent figure in his child's life or content, as opposed to someone like Greg Paul.
2329000	2331000	Shannon also addresses the comments that she made in the video.
2356000	2361000	And yeah, when you put it like that it does seem kinda obvious, but it wasn't really just a one-time joke,
2361000	2365000	it was a bit of a recurring theme, and to counter your point, these things aren't that preposterous
2365000	2370000	when you consider the effects of nature and nurture, and how someone's family environment may affect them.
2370000	2375000	Anyhow, I have greater gripes elsewhere, relating to our old friend Karuna Satori.
2375000	2379000	In Satori's video that she made about the situation, she explained how she got very heated
2379000	2384000	and felt a little guilty about getting that far into it, so she ended up doing something very reasonable,
2384000	2390000	very reasonable when you pop off like that and DMing Shannon, giving her a very nice apology.
2390000	2395000	However, no no no no no, that wasn't enough. I'm not exactly sure what the hell happened,
2395000	2399000	but Shannon ended up just ignoring the DM altogether and then used it in her video.
2399000	2405000	Now, a lot of people, including me, found this to be so unbelievably petty of Shannon to do,
2405000	2409000	as well as immature and so goddamn childish.
2409000	2412000	Now, in her video, Toby didn't really portray the incident accurately,
2412000	2417000	in essence stating that after a rather heated exchange, Karuna reached out to Shannon with an apology,
2417000	2422000	which Shannon proceeded to ignore, yet used in her video. Although all of these individual events did occur,
2422000	2426000	they omit information that makes the situation seem more one-sided than it actually was,
2426000	2432000	and Shannon is fast to point this out and defend her video on Karuna as being instigated by the ASMR creator herself,
2432000	2433000	who attacked her endlessly.
2433000	2437000	About a day or so later, she messaged me saying that she was sorry and I didn't respond,
2437000	2442000	because once again, I didn't know her at that point. She also misrepresented what the situation was about.
2442000	2446000	Instead of saying it was her defending anti-vaxxers, it was her defending something else.
2446000	2450000	I forget what it was, but she didn't say it was anti-vaxx.
2450000	2455000	Only then, after she said that, and after she misrepresented the situation, did I respond publicly.
2455000	2459000	In this case, she is completely within her right to correct the falsities contained within Toby's upload.
2459000	2465000	However, she also doesn't have the facts completely straight herself, which is somewhat surprising given it was her own public drama.
2465000	2467000	In fact, there were a few faults with her own recounting.
2467000	2472000	Now, with the majority of the tweets removed, it is somewhat difficult to create a completely perfect timeline,
2472000	2475000	but this is the closest it's gonna be, so let's go through these faults.
2475000	2481000	I did, however, get semi-annoyed when she started talking to the Rewired Soul, aka the man who straight up said I had no value to society,
2481000	2486000	and talked about how terrible I was with him, but I still didn't respond or talk about it because I thought,
2486000	2489000	you know what, it's fine, she doesn't like me, she doesn't need to like me, it's cool.
2489000	2493000	In her testimony, Shannon implies that Karuna engaged with the Rewired Soul to spite her.
2493000	2498000	She doesn't explicitly say this, but it's the only way that such information would ever be remotely relevant.
2498000	2505000	This is not the case. The Rewired Soul responded to Karuna's tweet about Creepshow Art and they discussed the topic briefly after that.
2505000	2510000	Chris is one of the few people who has not deleted his tweets from around that time, so it's quite easy to follow the interactions,
2510000	2514000	and it's clear that Karuna and Chris have spoken previously and have an established connection.
2514000	2518000	However, there is no record of them speaking after she had apologised.
2519000	2525000	Because even after she apologised when she said that message, she was still publicly responding to the Rewired Soul,
2525000	2527000	saying the same things, and agreeing with him.
2527000	2531000	Shannon states that Karuna had continued to give her grief after she had apologised,
2531000	2536000	essentially saying that her apology didn't mean anything. This is partly true, but also lacking context.
2536000	2542000	Karuna made her initial tweets on February 19th, in response to Shannon's anti-vax video, before sending a message to Shannon.
2542000	2548000	She did not tweet immediately after she sent the apology, and her apology came after her conversation with the Rewired Soul.
2548000	2553000	The next time she mentions Shannon is the 5th and 6th of March, when she expresses her anger at Shannon's Jacqueline video,
2553000	2558000	first in response to Jacqueline, calling her scum, but then responding to Dustin Daily and ready to glare as well.
2558000	2563000	Shannon then subtweets Karuna in reference to her reply to Jacqueline, prompting a reply from Karuna,
2563000	2569000	who basically says, say it to my face, and Creepshow accordingly does this, and the anti-vax content is brought back up.
2569000	2574000	There was no real contradictory behaviour from Karuna, even if what she said was completely out of order,
2574000	2578000	changing your opinion on someone as new information arises is not conflicting.
2578000	2583000	The lie here that Shannon can't remember is that basically Karuna said that Shannon was insulting someone's looks,
2583000	2587000	when in actuality she was more insulting the anti-vaxxers through their appearance,
2587000	2592000	and also you can't draw that from what Karuna says, and once again I don't think it's too much work to clarify that,
2592000	2596000	but it seems that Shannon had a different route of addressing it in mind.
2596000	2598000	Which brings me to my next point.
2598000	2602000	I didn't watch her content, it didn't matter to me. When I finally did talk about it,
2602000	2608000	it was after days of Karuna talking about it, and it was after she responded to a subtweet asking me to call her out.
2608000	2614000	I only talked about this after she misrepresented the situation and tried to make it seem like I was bullying just random people,
2614000	2617000	when all I had said was anti-vaxxers looked like parents.
2621000	2624000	This is the strangest claim she makes in the video.
2624000	2630000	I don't think Karuna responding to a subtweet basically telling her to say it to her face was her encouraging a video.
2630000	2635000	In fact, Creepshow made an entire thread on Karuna in response to that tweet, so she clearly understood what Karuna meant.
2635000	2637000	The video was just a bonus.
2654000	2680000	I'm not particularly fond of what Karuna said, and it shouldn't be hard to see why.
2680000	2686000	I think she did instigate part of this situation, she made it public first, and her framing could definitely be viewed as questionable.
2686000	2688000	But Shan's framing isn't completely fair either.
2688000	2694000	This wasn't Creepshow Art doing her absolute best to avoid talking about a situation under all circumstances,
2694000	2697000	this was her dunking on someone who was giving her grief.
2697000	2701000	And you know what? She's in her right to do that, but you need to have the facts right,
2701000	2705000	because otherwise it just sounds like you're looking for more justification than you actually have.
2705000	2711000	She's already won this war on Twitter multiple times, using narratives surrounding someone like the Rewired Soul seems cheap,
2711000	2715000	and designed to frame it like Karuna was purposely trying to trigger her through abuser narratives.
2715000	2717000	That's not fair on either party.
2717000	2719000	If you're gonna make a video, own it.
2719000	2723000	But in a way, she did, just not the one we're talking about.
2723000	2729000	I am not trying to say that Toby is wrong to dislike me, or dislike who I have, quote, turned into, or grown into.
2729000	2733000	I have changed, I absolutely have changed, and I'm going to continue to change,
2733000	2735000	because that's what happens with life.
2735000	2741000	There's one more narrative that Shannon seeks to address in her uploads, and that's one raised by multiple disillusioned audience members,
2741000	2743000	the one that feels she has changed.
2743000	2748000	This narrative was also spawned from Toby's video, which once again focuses a little too much on the personal side,
2748000	2750000	although I do understand what they're trying to say.
2750000	2757000	When I started YouTube, as you guys all know, I was homeless, and I was living out of my car with my husband in Portland, Oregon.
2757000	2763000	During the time I was homeless, I was working between two to three drops, depending on what year it was, and I was stressed out of my mind.
2763000	2769000	I started making YouTube videos as a way to unwind and de-stress, and something that I would do kind of as a hobby.
2769000	2774000	I never expected it to become what it is now, and I never expected it to go anywhere.
2774000	2780000	Shannon takes an approach to this point that may surprise some, admitting she has changed, but also saying that this is who she is now,
2780000	2782000	and that she wouldn't go back to who she was.
2782000	2786000	I wanted to say that Toby is not wrong in saying that I have changed, because I have.
2786000	2790000	However, when I started making my videos, I was not happy. I wasn't.
2790000	2795000	There's this idea that when I made my videos beforehand, I was super happy, and I was going through all of this and all this stuff.
2795000	2800000	I was not in a good place, physically or mentally, and just because I used to do something that made you guys happy,
2800000	2805000	it wasn't something that fueled me the same way it fueled you, and I hope you guys can understand that.
2805000	2809000	If you like my older videos, thank you. I mean it. Thank you.
2809000	2815000	It means the world to me that the art I made in that time frame means a lot to you, because it means a lot to me.
2815000	2821000	However, I do not and do not want to go back to the person I was when I made those videos,
2821000	2831000	because I was having panic attacks every night in my car, hurting myself, and there is so much more that I can't go back to that person.
2831000	2834000	She talks about her background, the fact that not so long ago, she had very little.
2834000	2839000	She was making videos out of the back of her car, and she has really worked hard to be where she is today,
2839000	2843000	and you know what? I have a lot of respect for that. I'll speak about this more later,
2843000	2848000	I think anyone who's had YouTube transform their life has a justified connection to their channel which they don't want to yield.
2848000	2855000	I think it's completely valid if a person wants to distance themselves from more personal topics they felt more comfortable speaking about as a smaller creator.
2855000	2860000	Nonetheless, as defined as you can be, you need to be sure what side of yourself you're actually sticking up for.
2860000	2864000	Again, there's a lot of valid criticism in this video, and a lot of things that I'm going to use to move forward.
2864000	2869000	However, I want to make it very clear, I am not going to go back to the content I was making beforehand,
2869000	2873000	and I'm absolutely not going to go back to the person I was when I started this channel.
2873000	2879000	I was in an extremely dark place, and even if you liked me better when I was going through that and making content surrounding that,
2879000	2884000	that is something I simply cannot do, if only for my own mental health and my own needs.
2884000	2888000	I don't think Toby or others were asking Sharon to return to her homeless style,
2888000	2891000	although I think some would have liked to have seen that more personal side of her again.
2891000	2896000	They were also concerned that she'd become too cynical and too harsh in her presentation of people's actions,
2896000	2902000	that she was more preoccupied with having a video out on a daily basis than the due diligence that such content required,
2902000	2906000	and that she spent far too much time in the Twitter mindset of constantly engaging in pointless views.
2906000	2910000	That's not a side of yourself that you want to retain if you care about improving yourself as a person,
2910000	2912000	and there was just an indication that maybe,
2912000	2916000	Shannon hadn't expelled that slightly less well rounded aspect of her.
2916000	2918000	I have a fair few issues with Shannon's video,
2918000	2922000	mainly because it is such a level headed response that makes a fair few concessions,
2922000	2926000	and therefore it makes it difficult to explain her subsequent misrepresentations.
2926000	2931000	Nothing is grossly distorted, but they're all noticeable once you're familiar with the actual version of events.
2931000	2935000	The strange thing is that I think if she had told the truth, it still wouldn't have been a big deal.
2935000	2939000	At the end of the day, Karuna in particular made some extremely strongly worded comments towards her,
2939000	2944000	and although I personally wouldn't make a response video to it, given the style of the Creepshow art channel,
2944000	2946000	I don't think a response is unreasonable.
2946000	2950000	However, once again, her habit of slightly bending the facts seems somewhat second nature,
2950000	2954000	and given the fact that her response video was in a way like any other Creepshow art video,
2954000	2959000	you could see that there were still parts of her that hadn't changed, and those with a critical eye picked it up.
2959000	2964000	There was one moderately well received ten minute video that observed some issues with Shannon's response,
2964000	2970000	but because the truth was still not particularly damning and Shannon had apologised on the points related to her greatest shortcomings,
2970000	2973000	most were inclined to accept the apology and move on.
2973000	2978000	After all, there were greater enemies out there to fight, though I'm not sure everyone agreed.
2978000	2985000	Creepshow art is her channel. The video is called H3H3 is faking drama with Trisha Paytas for views, and it's gross.
2988000	2993000	Right now, it ain't fake. Trust me, I wish it was fake. Yeah, I wish it was fake.
2993000	2998000	But you know what this shit I'm dealing with is like, fuck you, I wish this shit was fake.
2998000	3003000	A month later, Creepshow had her channel temporarily demonetised shortly after H3's response
3003000	3007000	to an older video where she had claimed Ethan and Hila were faking drama for views.
3007000	3012000	At first, some thought this was related to Ethan and Hila's video, though Ariel Versace chose to tweet at Shannon,
3012000	3014000	claiming responsibility for the outcome.
3014000	3019000	Fortunately, in this case, H3 stated that they spoke to YouTube and managed to reverse this decision,
3019000	3024000	likely in an attempt to distance themselves from any idea that they would want to have a channel critical of them demonetised,
3024000	3029000	but it showed that some people were just not over it, and should they be?
3029000	3035000	Versace's comments completed this saga of drama, and although Shannon's video on the hashtag cancel Jake Yonsei matter
3035000	3039000	had been unlisted for nearly a month at this point, showing that she wanted to move on from it,
3039000	3045000	and making me ask whether this was really Versace's doing, there was still a brooding sentiment that all was not over.
3045000	3051000	Shannon's video, although being a defence of her character, which I can respect, never contained the pledge to change.
3051000	3056000	Sure, she apologised for her errors, but defended what many believed yielded those exact errors,
3056000	3060000	and so although it was fair to give her a second chance, it constantly felt like she was walking a tightrope
3060000	3065000	that threatened to plunge her back into the abyss of conflict, with possibly worse consequences.
3065000	3070000	The strange detail is that she seemed to be aware of that, and if she is conscious of that side of her,
3070000	3073000	how much of that can be chalked up to impulsivity?
3073000	3078000	Some believe that she was simply too blasé and dismissive of the actual consequences her words pertained,
3078000	3082000	others believe she was far too emotionally invested in the topics to think clearly.
3082000	3086000	Neither of these seem particularly consistent with each other, in fact they seem kind of contradictory,
3086000	3092000	yet they both rear their head in Shannon's video. What we know is that she wasn't going back.
3092000	3095000	So, what does going forward mean?
3095000	3100000	As 2020 proceeded, Creepshow went in and out of the motions of uploads and occasional arguments with any old creator
3100000	3104000	who was willing to trade words with our title character. However, as the year drew to a close,
3104000	3110000	and Christmas seemed to approach, Shannon had some tidings to share, though I won't be the one to share them today.
3111000	3116000	Yes, ladies, gentlemen, and everyone in between, today I've brought a friend to help me shed light on a situation
3116000	3120000	that seemed murkier than any other, so to talk about the Hopeless Peaches drama,
3120000	3126000	I present my small channel drama correspondent, Sister Zaya, to talk about these charades. Take it away girl.
3126000	3144000	The right opinion. The pineapple pizza hater he is wants me to talk about a little incident with you lucky group of people.
3144000	3151000	Let me just look through my files here. Ah, Hopeless Peaches and Creepshow art.
3152000	3157000	For those of you who do not know, Hopeless Peaches is a content creator within the art commentary community.
3157000	3162000	I know, another sub-genre of commentators crawling around like the rats they are.
3162000	3168000	At least this time, they can draw. And I'm pretty sure all of you know who Creepshow is by now.
3168000	3172000	I personally like to call her the Nikocado Avocado of the art community.
3172000	3177000	The only difference between the two is that he is playing a character. She is not.
3177000	3184000	However, before we get into the real juicy parts of all of this, I need to briefly supply a bit more context.
3184000	3191000	A lot of you know already about Tobi from Tro. However, after her Creepshow art video, she had started to obtain more eyes towards her.
3191000	3202000	For better or for worse, this had led to more people digging into Tobi's character and starting to find issues with her attitude and opinions towards other drama channels making videos on creators she seemingly supported.
3202000	3214000	I'm sick and tired of commentary channels and drama channels that severely hypercriticize and pick apart every single little thing that somebody does online even though they know themselves as fucking creators.
3214000	3217000	That they're a shit that goes on behind closed fucking doors.
3217000	3223000	You're screaming about drama channels being hypocritical, which is a drastic overgeneralization.
3223000	3228000	Most drama channels literally report what's going on in the internet world or what's happening with the public figure.
3228000	3235000	What about those channels is so hypercritical? Of course they aren't aware of what happens behind closed doors. I completely agree.
3235000	3239000	But who is to say that what's happening behind closed doors isn't problematic?
3239000	3243000	A lot of other people had also called her out for a numerous amount of hypocrisies.
3243000	3249000	This later turned into its own massive drama containing multiple people either defending Tobi or going against her.
3249000	3261000	There was a lot of more nuance in the situation despite that, where Omnia, one of Tobi's detractors, had even leaked a personal story of Tobi's by mistake when attempting to show DMs between Tobi and themselves.
3261000	3267000	Hopeless Peaches had actually taken notice of this and left a few comments disavowing these actions.
3267000	3276000	This however led to YouTube commentator PrisonMateLuke to make a video explaining his frustrations with the fact that the community is still talking about Tobi.
3276000	3286000	He had criticized Peaches in the end for having public tangents within the situation, then leaving comments where she claimed to not want to be associated with the drama and wanted no part in it whatsoever.
3286000	3295000	And another person who commented was Hopeless Peaches, who also decided to put herself into the drama despite constantly saying how she doesn't want to be in it and would just never leave it alone.
3295000	3307000	And when people like Thumbin called her out for her terrible and biased behavior, she made a community post about how she wasn't friends with Tobi, which I didn't actually know she wasn't friends with Tobi because she did everything in her power to defend her.
3307000	3318000	However, this was then later followed up by Luke with claims that Peaches was suicide baiting as Peaches had left a few vague tweets alluding to her having suicidal thoughts.
3318000	3329000	While you say you're going to be taking a break from the drama and comments and all that, which is fine if you need a break you need one I'm not saying you don't have mental health problems, but you would constantly come back to post more things than beg for sympathy.
3329000	3334000	And when you were getting genuine criticism for all the garbage you've done, you decided to suicide bait your audience.
3334000	3341000	Now I want to make something clear here, Luke is an idiot in more ways than one and I would apologize if I'm being too harsh.
3341000	3353000	But if you have the balls to claim someone is faking suicide for attention in front of a large audience, especially without taking into consideration the repercussions that could follow, you lose all sympathy from me.
3353000	3359000	When it comes to situations like these, it's better to give people the benefit of the doubt and back down for a little and wait things out.
3360000	3365000	Unless you're like Luke, who likes to sniff and eat glue, doubling down on these things is never a good option.
3365000	3369000	Also, Luke, the term you used wasn't even the correct one.
3369000	3374000	Suicide baiter is a term that's meant for those who bait people into suicide.
3374000	3385000	A month later, after the release of this video, Miss Shannon had decided to put out a tweet of her own accusing someone of spreading lies about them, saying that Shannon was a psychotic person.
3385000	3390000	Oh no, how terrible. This is what I call foreshadowing, by the way.
3390000	3398000	Our best friend Luke had picked up on this, rubbed his hairy, disease-filled rat hands together and rushed over the Creepshow's DMs.
3398000	3403000	And behold, it turns out Shannon's tweet was about peaches all along. Shocking!
3403000	3407000	Luke decided to take this time to turn this into a video.
3407000	3411000	Now before we get into this fantastic video of Luke's, I want to play a fun game.
3412000	3423000	Do you think that Luke, A, treated these as allegations and rumors, or B, took everything that Shannon said at face value because he's a dirty rat who does no research before clicking upload?
3426000	3433000	It's clearly B. I mean, he doesn't even make it hard. When he opens up about Shannon's rumors, he straight up says,
3433000	3441000	Now before peaches or anyone else says that I'm faking these or something else stupid, I got these from the lady herself, Creepshow. So don't try and say these are fake.
3441000	3448000	Oh wow, man. Who wouldn't trust Shannon? She's such an angel who should always be taken at face value, right?
3449000	3455000	Not to mention that I personally think a lot of the things that were said were petty, to say the least.
3455000	3462000	I mean, one of the issues Shannon had was that after her Jaclyn Hill video, a video that was seen as notoriously bad by the community,
3462000	3465000	Peaches had decided to soft block her on Twitter.
3465000	3475000	And when Peaches got mad at Creepshow for her Jaclyn Hill video, instead of being a friend and not letting it ruin her friendship with her, she soft blocked Creepshow and started vaguely treating about her out of spite.
3475000	3488000	Oh no, a person doesn't like you anymore. I get that she was seen as a friend, but the fact that you left that in there just for the sake to make everything seem so much larger than it was is pretty pathetic.
3488000	3495000	Now I will say, there were other portions that were important, like her claims of Peaches going around and spreading lies about her.
3495000	3504000	And not only that, Peaches decided to ruin Creepshow's reputation in the art community, telling people that Creepshow had yelled at her and was just losing it at her.
3504000	3510000	Poisoning Creepshow's reputation while she was still just a small channel, she was below 100,000 subscribers when this happened.
3510000	3516000	And the crazy part is that while this was all going on, Creepshow was in the dark and thought everything was okay between her and Peaches.
3517000	3524000	I can see why someone would be upset with that. And if that were true, I'd agree that would probably be an important thing to address.
3524000	3528000	Though later down the line, you'll see that wasn't also black and white.
3528000	3532000	After Luke uploaded the video, two notable people had decided to leave a comment.
3532000	3538000	One being Shannon, thanking Luke for making the video, and the other a YouTuber known as Camilla Cuevas.
3538000	3544000	A content creator in the animation and Undertale community who had claimed Peaches had as well spread lies about her.
3544000	3549000	Camilla had also claimed that Peaches bullied her to the point of needing to go to the hospital.
3549000	3558000	Now there were also a bunch of different people who later came forward about Peaches, all with differing allegations, but all of them led to the same conclusion.
3558000	3561000	That being Peaches was a bad friend to them.
3561000	3573000	I won't be going over them in this segment, but it is important to know the existence of these videos and that they did happen because all of them led up to what is Shannon's weirdest videos to ever exist on her channel to this day.
3574000	3585000	Shannon had uploaded her first video, where she had decided to go in more depth regarding her situation with Peaches, while also subtly bringing up other's personal disgruntled with Peaches as well.
3585000	3593000	She had put out this image that Peaches was this huge manipulator who had a pattern of lying about other content creators with claims that held no weight.
3593000	3602000	Sure, did she purposely go out of her way to tell people that she knew I liked and admired in this community that I told her I liked and admired that I was a terrible person who deserved to be taken off the platform?
3602000	3609000	Absolutely yes. Did she tell them that due to a disagreement that I had flipped out on her which did not happen and told people that I am a volatile mess?
3609000	3615000	Yeah sure, but in my head that wasn't that bad and if that was her interpretation of me, that was fine.
3615000	3626000	It wasn't until I talked to other content creators who also know her, creators who had their own experiences with this same person, creators who have been lied to and about the same way, that I realized that I needed to talk about this.
3626000	3633000	It didn't end there though. Creepshow had decided to mention an old conversation she had regarding a collaboration the two of them had.
3633000	3639000	Peaches had stopped interacting with her on all social media after the collaboration, which confused Shannon.
3639000	3649000	Creepshow decided to then finally reach out to Peaches, to which Peaches explained that she thought Shannon was upset with her because their collaboration didn't get as many views as expected.
3649000	3660000	This then later transpired into Peaches making claims that another fellow commentator, DaftPina, had gone to Peaches and told her that her collaboration with Creepshow ruined Shannon's channel.
3679000	3685000	DaftPina, the YouTuber, had told her that the video had quote ruined my channel and that I was probably mad at her for doing that.
3685000	3701000	This was then followed up with numerous other allegations of Peaches having a conversation with Shannon about her Jacqueline Hill video, to which she then claimed Peaches went around after her telling people that Shannon yelled at her during this and framed her to be some sort of lunatic.
3701000	3710000	Creepshow had felt it was also necessary to reach out to Toby, as in her original video, Toby had claimed that people were too scared to confront Shannon.
3710000	3718000	Creepshow wanted to make it clear with Toby that she didn't want to give off this impression that she was this scary individual who was out for blood.
3718000	3726000	She had even DM'd a few other people this as well, except Peaches because Peaches had previously mentioned to her that she wanted some space away.
3726000	3737000	However, Peaches apparently reached out to Creepshow not too long after. Peaches had abruptly gone into Shannon's DM's and told her that she wasn't happy with how she painted her as a, and I quote, bitch.
3737000	3750000	When I reached out to Toby, I let them know like, hey, I hope you truly aren't scared of me. I hope that really isn't the case because out of everything in that video, that was what was most important to me, is that I don't want people to think I'm this terrifying person.
3751000	3768000	And because Peaches had already stated that she wanted space, I didn't reach out to her until she sent me a DM, pretty much stating that me crying in my response video by me talking about the part where, once again, she approved, Toby putting this in her video, where Toby said she was scared of me and she cried because of me, that I had made her look like a bitch.
3768000	3779000	She responded by telling me I made her look like a bitch, and she was going to reach out again because she saw me quote, improving, but then decided not to since my video was very one-sided and it was a one-sided retelling of events.
3779000	3784000	Though this video didn't incorporate much evidence towards a lot of the claims Shannon presented.
3784000	3791000	However, this didn't stop people from taking things at face value, as beforehand, a lot of creators did that work for Shannon.
3791000	3801000	Other creators had come forward with somewhat similar claims, so Shannon had ended up feeding an already angry mob without needing to back any of her claims up.
3801000	3808000	This sadly, however, was just the roadmap to what was about to be something way much worse and irrational.
3808000	3811000	Shannon had decided to upload a second video a month later.
3811000	3819000	This video was mainly due to a document that was made in defense of Peaches and as well Toby coming forward and calling out Shannon.
3819000	3831000	You see, Toby had felt that too many people were going after Peaches at this time for unjustified reasons and felt that this entire situation was being blown out of proportion with little to no evidence to back it up.
3831000	3833000	Shannon was not happy with this.
3833000	3834000	Toby stated this,
3863000	3871000	That's what this reads to me. She's still very upset about what happened to her, so that's okay.
3871000	3875000	I was the only person to stand up for Peaches and I would do it again because I know her.
3875000	3878000	Which is just you saying that I am biased but go off.
3878000	3883000	Also, just so it's known, Peaches had absolutely no involvement in my Creepshow art video.
3883000	3884000	Pause right here.
3884000	3892000	If you used her testimony, which you did, you state you did, and you state that it was supposed to be a collab, which both you and Peaches have affirmed separately.
3892000	3897000	Then what you did, just now, in front of the world, in front of the classroom, is lie.
3897000	3904000	This was then followed up with Shannon going through a document that was made by two small creators, Spy V and Skritus.
3904000	3908000	However, Shannon portrayed this document to also be made by Peaches.
3908000	3910000	This just wasn't true though.
3910000	3918000	Spy V had even gone on to make their own response video where they showed that all they did was interview Peaches and asked for her side.
3918000	3926000	Shannon refers to the document written by Peaches and friends and claims she doesn't believe that Peaches did not help write the document.
3926000	3936000	I mean, if you really want to believe that, fine, I can't stop you, but at least be consistent and say that Peaches helped on Spocktor's video because we did the exact same thing that he did.
3936000	3945000	We asked for her side of the story, she did and gave us any relevant screenshots, and then we, in a completely separate group chat, went over all of it and compiled it into a document.
3945000	3951000	Peaches was not allowed to see the document until it was completely done and she did not edit or comment on it at all.
3951000	3959000	Peaches had no involvement with the actual making of this document and was simply asked questions for proof to back the answer she gave.
3959000	3964000	Shannon then goes on to discuss the document's coverage of DMs between her and Peaches.
3964000	3977000	This was in regards to the previous claim Shannon made, where she alleged that Peaches had told her that she thought she was upset because their video collaboration ruined her channel and didn't get as many views as expected.
3977000	3983000	Which, during this conversation, she then claims that Peaches had made previous remarks of wanting to hurt herself.
3983000	3987000	Shannon was worried about this and gave Peaches her personal phone number.
3987000	3995000	These DMs were also shown in the document, though of course Shannon's phone number wasn't at all shown in the actual document.
3995000	4003000	Nonetheless, she then makes the assumption that because these DMs were in the document, that Peaches had shown Spivey and Skritus her personal phone number.
4003000	4007000	Which, by the way, Peaches didn't do that.
4007000	4015000	If the people who had these screenshots literally scrolled up, which I cannot do because, once again, Peaches blocked me after she realized I had access to this conversation and she didn't want that,
4015000	4025000	you would see her literally falsely accusing another YouTuber, that being with the what again, of flagging her account and causing her to be unable to make money and be unable to support herself.
4025000	4032000	I would love to see this document talk about the false accusations she leveled at him, seeing as apparently they have access to the entire conversation, but I guess not.
4032000	4037000	It also makes me feel entirely weird that all of these people have seen my private phone number, so that's fun, I love that.
4037000	4047000	This video was when some people started to realize Shannon's irrationalities, as this entire video was filled with assumptions and felt very exaggerated.
4047000	4056000	It didn't help either that she had also claimed that Peaches was racist, because she, and I quote, pissed off an angry black woman.
4056000	4064000	But literally people telling her, hey, the thing you did is bad in regards to lying about various people and situations in order to appear like an uwu victim?
4065000	4075000	Yeah, that's stupid. And I keep a bit racist when we get into what you try to pull with Kai and Omnia. I mean, you have to be the white girl victim to the angry black woman and black man, right?
4075000	4087000	I would say if anything, Shannon, you calling Omnia an angry black woman is probably more racist than Peaches disagreeing with Omnia over Twitter drama.
4088000	4095000	After this video was uploaded and Peaches caught wind of Creepshow leching that they doxxed her, Peaches decided to send Creepshow an email.
4095000	4107000	Very upset and rightfully so, by the way, to which Creepshow was so cocky with this that she had decided to leave a pinned comment on the video to mock Peaches about the email.
4107000	4123000	Peaches made a response video a while after this. I do want to clarify that Peaches had made another response video before all of this, though I don't entirely believe that its existence is important to this overall video surrounding Creepshow.
4123000	4129000	As a lot of what was said there is said in this current response video, but better.
4129000	4138000	Her original video response was lacking and felt like an impulse reaction rather than something that was meant to disprove allegations.
4138000	4144000	In her new response video, though, it's much more structured and disproves a lot of stuff that people put out against her.
4144000	4153000	Peaches had gone on to share that Camilla didn't give the full picture, and it was actually Camilla herself who was bullying Peaches for her mental wellbeing.
4153000	4168000	I find it very distressing how back in 2018 you continued to harass me, belittle me, lie about me, and actively go out of your way to try and ruin relationships I had with other creators even though I tried again and again to apologise to you.
4168000	4177000	I had no channel back then, besides a shitty dump of a channel with just AMVs and procreate timelapses. I had no voice.
4177000	4185000	To publicly berate me, then blame me when you got caught in a lie because you still didn't take down the merch as late as March?
4185000	4195000	Yeah, it was distressing. You had a channel of nearly 700,000k and you were growing very fast during this time too.
4195000	4201000	And you would demand apology after apology just to say it wasn't worth shit.
4201000	4208000	You would send your moderators to tell me the only way you would leave me alone would be if I delete all my social media.
4208000	4212000	Social media that I have to stress had no following.
4212000	4219000	You would compare my actions to murder. You would allow your moderators to publicly wish I would die.
4219000	4234000	And then, for you to come back 3 years later to actually make the claim I was a liar and bullied you so much I pushed you into hospital after you went out of your way to mock my own mental health?
4234000	4237000	What a horrible claim and weight to put on somebody.
4237000	4243000	Peaches had as well denied a large portion of Shannon's claims and had called her out for the lack of evidence.
4243000	4248000	Though, this didn't stop Peaches from admitting that she did do wrong in this situation.
4248000	4253000	To Creepshawart, I apologise for soft blocking you after the Jaclyn Hill video.
4253000	4258000	We had our differences but we were friends and I shouldn't have made subtweets about the situation.
4258000	4263000	I understand why that would have hurt you and it was stupid of me to do that. I'm sorry.
4263000	4269000	At the end of the day when it comes to Peaches and Shannon though, they were both part of a toxic friendship.
4269000	4276000	Though I don't think that excuse is going in front of a massive audience and spreading things about someone who was your friend without proof.
4276000	4279000	At that point, all you're doing is spreading rumours.
4279000	4285000	Which is practically ironic because Creepshow ended up doing the very thing she claimed Peaches did to her.
4285000	4289000	The only difference is that she claimed Peaches went around telling other content creators.
4289000	4297000	Shannon did this all publicly for the entire YouTube community to watch and people believed almost every word she said.
4297000	4301000	You see, Shannon's real art and talent don't lie with her drawings.
4301000	4307000	Creepshow's art lies with her ability to take a situation in the direction she wants it to.
4307000	4311000	But I will let our lovely host tell you more about that.
4311000	4314000	Thank you Austin, I'll be leaving her channel in the description below.
4314000	4318000	But for the moment, let's have a reflection of what people seem to observe at this point.
4318000	4323000	Now, I wasn't particularly familiar with the Hopeless Peaches capers that my good colleague has just documented,
4323000	4329000	but I think it clearly demonstrated those lingering issues with Creepshow art's demeanour and how that carried over into her content.
4329000	4337000	You gotta think before making these kinds of claims out of nowhere. It's a prime example of you letting emotions get the better of you and saying something you end up regretting later.
4337000	4342000	Many people covering this at the time attributed the behaviour to her emotional nature in these situations.
4342000	4348000	This was often channeled through her voice, which regularly escalated in its frequency and amplitude when dealing with topics that she clearly found triggering.
4357000	4361000	Content that some viewed as ambient background noise, it was still designed to draw one's attention.
4361000	4368000	We can all be a bit emotional and sometimes it's completely natural, but we still make the active decision whether that's substance worth keeping in those uploads.
4368000	4375000	Shan continuously made the active decision to upload this content with her emotional moments, and there's a point where spontaneity can only explain so much.
4375000	4381000	Like any bad apology video where someone cries excessively, although it's understandable to be emotional in those situations,
4381000	4386000	you still need to convey a coherent and accurate message to your audience, even if it's biased.
4386000	4392000	You can't let your emotions overly miss that to the point where you're actively delivering false information about a person or a situation,
4392000	4395000	especially when this drama wasn't even the biggest deal in the first place.
4395000	4401000	It's hard to establish a motive for the post that caused this. There's nothing wrong with tweeting about people who have wronged you here and there.
4401000	4410000	Sometimes it's good to let off a little steam, but to go out of your way to name, shame, and initiate all this backlash against a person whose worst crime was being a bit of a shitty person is questionable.
4410000	4416000	People are shitty sometimes. As long as a. they answer a threat to others, or b. it is in a present pattern of behaviour,
4416000	4423000	there has to be some perspective to their actions taken. People sit down, watch films, sympathise with anti-heroes who've done much worse than anyone online,
4423000	4426000	then open Twitter and turn on whichever person has been branded a meanie.
4426000	4430000	However, at the time, plenty began to believe it was a clear pattern of behaviour,
4430000	4435000	which caused this domino effect of people talking about negative experiences with her like they were out of the ordinary,
4435000	4439000	despite the fact that we have so many interactions and conversations that some are going to be negative,
4439000	4442000	especially with people who are not necessarily mentally stable.
4442000	4449000	It's very easy to take a set of negative experiences and present it as the entire story when their quote dark side is being dissected.
4449000	4453000	And make no mistake, Hopeless Peach has had her reputation absolutely tarnished from this drama.
4453000	4456000	As said at the start, my experience with what happened was perfunctory,
4456000	4460000	but I still know that although she may not have handled it well and behaved poorly,
4460000	4464000	she did not receive a hearing, and was basically overrun by people who treated her like a criminal,
4464000	4468000	when it's questionable whether it was even a case of public interest in the first place.
4468000	4472000	This is strictly my opinion, and people can of course do whatever they want,
4472000	4476000	but super serious content shouldn't be made with the purpose to solely attack others,
4476000	4480000	it should be done to inform, protect, and help, even towards the subjects of our content.
4480000	4486000	Sometimes we don't always manage to do that, sometimes we have to sacrifice one of those aspects to pursue another that we view as more imperative,
4486000	4492000	but if you can't answer why you peddled a public narrative other than just to go for someone who really annoyed you, I can't get behind that.
4492000	4496000	Emotional moments in a video can't validate that if you're not shown the evidence to back it up.
4496000	4500000	Shannon used her tone to convey how much each matter clearly meant to her,
4500000	4504000	it evoked a lot of sympathy from her viewers, and even benefit of the doubt from critics.
4504000	4509000	The problem is that when you utilise that sort of emotion, you're going to be instigating an emotional response from your audience,
4509000	4515000	and when your audience responds emotionally to misinformation that may be designed to make a person look worse than they actually are,
4515000	4520000	you can cause excessive aggravation towards another person by proxy of your own misinformation.
4520000	4523000	Does that mean you're solely accountable for what others do? Not at all.
4523000	4528000	But if you've influenced them because you haven't been entirely honest, then you at least bear some responsibility.
4529000	4536000	The fact was that even in her sentimental state, she managed to consciously omit information that would have contextualised important details,
4536000	4538000	if you consider this case important at all.
4538000	4543000	The rational counter-argument to this would be, well, that is what happens in a state of emotionally invoked bias,
4543000	4547000	we tend to see a very one-sided perspective, and this is not entirely untrue.
4547000	4551000	Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that Shannon had seen the extent of the evidence in question,
4551000	4556000	and those like Just Stop seem to illustrate how she had danced around the incidents that may have placed her in a quandary.
4556000	4564000	The question then becomes, how irrational can one be to show bias while demonstrably being rather tactical in deciding what facets of a spectral is beneficial to discuss at all?
4564000	4568000	Something just didn't seem to quite add up in what people were concluding about Shannon's demeanour.
4568000	4572000	Equally though, even if she did have a tendency to blow up trivial issues,
4572000	4577000	because they were so trivial from the outset, she seldom faced any real ramifications for her shortcomings,
4577000	4583000	many involved forgot it as quickly as they waded into it, even if they had not been completely fair in their representation of the particulars,
4583000	4586000	and affected parties felt the aftershock far more intensely.
4586000	4591000	I want you to know I don't think you're a bad person, but this reason video certainly is not helping you.
4591000	4594000	If anything, maybe she'd live and learn from it all, maybe.
4594000	4599000	Well, for the most part, the next few months were fairly blissful in terms of drama, at least by Shannon's standards,
4599000	4604000	and her channel appeared to be in order, however maybe it wasn't what she said on a channel that should have concerned her.
4604000	4607000	I think you've all been sufficiently prepared for what we'll be talking about next,
4607000	4612000	so let's move into June 2021, and talk about one of my favourite topics, the gossip forums.
4612000	4623000	Gossip forums, my favourite cesspool.
4623000	4629000	I'm not gonna play ignorant and act like I don't end up looking over them a fair bit given that they often contain discussion about topics that interest me,
4629000	4632000	however they're also really terrible and really bitchy.
4632000	4636000	It's a contained discourse that I would always steer clear from contributing to,
4636000	4640000	but they have a habit of documenting some of the community's most notorious deviants.
4640000	4646000	Now there are a variety of forums that could be discussed, however the one I'm going to focus on is a forum by the name of Lolkal Farm.
4646000	4654000	A Lolkal, as we've discussed before, is someone so oblivious to the nature of the internet that they can never properly deal with the sometimes rather relentless trolling that is dished out.
4654000	4661000	Lolkal Farm seem to do a pretty good job at covering these individuals, with a few side hustles of just chatting shit about anyone.
4661000	4669000	Many of those who frequented the website would operate under the veil of anonymity, which is expected given what they often say wouldn't be the most welcome in civil society.
4669000	4676000	This is all rather unexceptional information on the surface, everyone talks shit about everyone else, how does this tie into the story of Creepshow art?
4676000	4683000	Well there was a thread on Creepshow which had been operational since October 2020, though that is of some interest, there's something more specific,
4683000	4689000	and in June 2021 one of the admins decided that the veil of anonymity would be lifted over a certain few accounts.
4689000	4695000	All of those accounts had commented on drama involving Creepshow and many of those that she knew and was associated with,
4695000	4702000	but there was one more curious detail they had in common, yes, according to the moderator in question, they were all operated by Shannon.
4702000	4709000	How did they conclude this? Well, it comes down to the IP on these accounts, short for Internet Protocol, it's often used by those online to identify the general
4709000	4717000	location and possibly identity of a user. Most of the time a person's IP is not public information because it can lead to revelations regarding the person's whereabouts,
4717000	4724000	and we do not endorse that. However, in this case, given that they felt Shannon's behaviour was careening out of hand, they've decided to put a stop to it.
4724000	4729000	An announcement post was made in the thread stating that although Creepshow art's posting to the forum had not been exactly subtle prior,
4729000	4735000	that she crossed a line when she posted her sibling's social media to deflect criticism from her, that's pretty shady stuff for sure,
4735000	4742000	but was it worth lifting the masquerade for? Well, it certainly is when you realise that her sibling was in the ICU, short for Intensive Care Unit,
4742000	4748000	for treatment when Shannon went into a lolcow forum and linked her Twitter, and that's barely the half of it.
4748000	4753000	Amongst the rest of the post documented were various slighted comments directed towards people who many assumed were Shannon's friends,
4753000	4761000	including D'Angelo Wallace who is a callous callout creator, ready to glare who's sucking up to Shannon's clout, and Edward's generation who simps for terrible people.
4761000	4768000	Another time while she was uploading videos defending Corpse Husband from certain toxic fandoms, she was supposedly posting in a thread that attempted to dox him,
4768000	4775000	ridiculing his fans, and stirring the pot in general. Obviously if that's what she says about her friends, you can only guess what she says about her adversaries,
4775000	4780000	including people like Hopeless Peaches, and in a way it makes sense given her publicly expressed feelings on them,
4780000	4785000	but it's still rather underhanded given how much animosity was already being spread during the situation.
4785000	4790000	To stoke fire under an alias while acting like you're taking the high road is nothing short of villains,
4790000	4794000	especially when such content is known to mobilise viewers from that position.
4794000	4800000	She posts links to people's social medias with the implication that they should go on there and keep giving them shit, all that wholesome stuff.
4800000	4806000	A male, she was not trans, she had never experienced body dysmorphia or felt what it was like to be in the wrong body
4806000	4810000	or dealt with any of the complex issues mentally and physically that trans people go through.
4810000	4815000	None of that had happened with her, no, she was just a cis woman who was a moron.
4815000	4820000	However, it doesn't stop there as many were quick to observe her rather flagrant use of slurs in posts to the forum,
4820000	4827000	which once again is certainly not out of place for a website like that, but is rather contradictory to her often socially sensitive readings of situations
4827000	4830000	and assumed advocacy for issues like body positivity.
4830000	4834000	The person who called artists racist with drawing somewhat poorly executed depictions of characters
4834000	4838000	has been firing off epithets fairly casually on her alt accounts.
4838000	4841000	She also used it to mysteriously predict what Shannon would be doing next,
4841000	4845000	often in what seemed like an attempt to hype up whatever drama she was embroiled in.
4845000	4850000	She'd brag about her own friends from that third person perspective, talk about how people may be hesitant to make videos,
4850000	4853000	and how she may weaponise her clout in these scenarios.
4854000	4859000	She also spoke quite harshly about herself, which one could typically chalk up to a concealed sense of self-loathing
4859000	4863000	or the attempt to throw off any suspicion, but in this case, compiling with messages about her sibling
4863000	4867000	and the hypothesis would seem to indicate that she was stirring up hate towards herself,
4867000	4869000	which she'd then play off during conflicts.
4869000	4876000	She'd regularly enact what I call the anti-flex, which is basically a way to attack herself while still emphasising some aspect of privilege she possessed.
4876000	4880000	If you did that in your own character, you'd probably be called out for being a braggart,
4880000	4883000	but it's much easier to do so when you appear to be talking about someone else.
4883000	4888000	Hypothetically, this is quite the scheme, because a lot of people really don't like being harassed online.
4888000	4891000	However, for those who can manage it, who don't have the conscience to care,
4891000	4895000	then it becomes very easy to use that harassment as ammunition for your own case,
4895000	4898000	and to deflect legitimate criticism that may be targeted at you.
4898000	4903000	Other behaviour is a bit harder to explain, including one where she has an argument with herself about herself,
4903000	4906000	after posting DMs with herself.
4906000	4909000	This fictional small YouTuber is mad that Shannon was rooted in the DMs,
4909000	4912000	makes generally garbage content, and is now holding a grudge against her.
4912000	4918000	This equally fictional respondent contests this, and argues that Shannon behaved completely properly given this small YouTuber's demeanour,
4918000	4920000	and that they were clearly attention seeking.
4920000	4923000	All I'll say is that both sides may have a point.
4923000	4926000	The only explanation I can provide here though, is that it was a slow week,
4926000	4931000	and the exchange does make Shannon look marginally more favourable than her manufactured hater, marginally.
4931000	4934000	It's a forum on a trash talking site, there's not much at stake here.
4934000	4941000	We could go through every individual post and break it down, but all I'll say is it definitely threw her credibility as a commentator into contention,
4941000	4945000	but it also just made people question her credibility as a person, and a friend.
4945000	4949000	However, the question still remained, how much can you prove from an IP?
4949000	4954000	Was there an alternative explanation for these escapades that didn't indict Shannon as the perpetrator of these posts?
4954000	4956000	Well, let's hear what she had to say.
4958000	4963000	On June 5th 2021, less than a week after the posts to the gossip forum had emerged,
4963000	4969000	Shannon took to the YouTube community tab to address the claims that were being levelled against her.
4969000	4973000	Now, she had a few options in approaching these allegations, dependent on her innocence of course.
4973000	4980000	She could provide the receipts that would exonerate her, she could cast a reasonable amount of doubt on it to make people more sceptical in analysis of the evidence,
4980000	4984000	or she could own up and accept accountability for her actions.
4984000	4988000	In this case, she chose the second option, which is probably the most challenging choice,
4988000	4992000	because you're leaving it open ended and down to your audience's interpretation of exactly who to believe.
4992000	4995000	You're not providing that closure which allows drama to conclude.
4995000	5001000	At the same time, she still had the opportunity to swing momentum in her favour, so what did her explanation entail?
5001000	5006000	The post claims that she was not the one behind these forum contributions, such as the doxxing.
5006000	5011000	After all, it is so antithetical to what she stands for as a creator, she couldn't have that on her conscience.
5011000	5016000	As a matter of fact, another person had been committing these offences, and attempting to mirror it onto Shannon's account by
5016000	5022000	spoofing my IP, doxxing my family members, writing things about myself and my friends, sending me death threats from other accounts,
5022000	5027000	making false accounts to spam my comment sections, spamming the comment sections of my friends saying hateful things about me
5027000	5032000	in order to get them to drop me, and just all around doing what she did years ago.
5032000	5035000	Whoever would perform such a heinous act.
5035000	5040000	While for those familiar with Shannon's channel, the person responsible for this behaviour wasn't a name completely foreign to them,
5040000	5044000	a person who went by Amy, who Shannon had previously believed to be on good terms with,
5044000	5051000	however, must have recently turned on her once more. This goes back to January 2019, when Shannon published a video covering this situation
5051000	5058000	under the title I was stalked for 8 plus years story time, where Shannon explains in much more depth how her friendship with Amy had turned sour
5058000	5063000	and led to a continuous wave of harassment and provocation on her former friend's part.
5063000	5069000	After I transferred over to Facebook, the emails started up again. They would talk about my friends, make digs at me,
5069000	5077000	and this time they were a lot more effective. It was like, in the time in which this person wasn't fucking with me by sending me emails,
5077000	5083000	they had taken a course about how to harass people, and just fucking passed that course with flying colours.
5083000	5089000	It was, it was a lot, and I was fucking overwhelmed, and so again, I isolated myself.
5089000	5095000	And at this point, I had really only ruled out one of my friends as being someone who wouldn't do this,
5095000	5101000	and she was essentially the only person I trusted for a very, very, very long time.
5101000	5105000	It's a very long and detailed video, and I don't really seek to go into too many specifics.
5105000	5111000	However, it definitely covers that more personal side of Shannon that many people in the day took to, and showed a more vulnerable side of her.
5111000	5117000	This person was saying shit that as much as I didn't want it to be true, it was fucking true.
5117000	5121000	I did self-harm, I did have suicidal thoughts, I didn't think I was worthy of my friends,
5121000	5124000	and I did believe that everyone around me hated me and thought terribly of me.
5124000	5129000	It wasn't fucked up, because it was all accurate, and it was all true.
5129000	5134000	In Shannon's post, she expresses confusion at how Amy has managed to pull this off, and is equally confused as to her motives.
5134000	5138000	However, she is steadfast that she wants this to be resolved as soon as possible,
5138000	5143000	and promises to send a cease and desist her way to make sure that these antics are brought to an end immediately.
5143000	5146000	After all, she doesn't want anyone else negatively affected by this.
5146000	5150000	She felt the need to put this update out because it's not fucking true that she'd ever do something like that,
5150000	5156000	and that although she understands if nobody believes her, she hopes that her record on this matter has shown itself to be consistent,
5156000	5159000	and therefore this testimony adds up.
5159000	5165000	Surely with this alternative explanation with a clear timeline, she is at least provided an account that seems more congruent with how people know her,
5165000	5169000	which may be cause to question the original theory posited by the forum admins, right?
5169000	5174000	Alas, an appeal to a behavioural argument can only work if the version of events seems sensible,
5174000	5178000	and many began to disbelieve aspects, particularly on the IP front,
5178000	5181000	which is one of the key pieces of evidence proffered by the lolcow team.
5181000	5189000	It receives a fleeting mention on Shan's community post, which as aforementioned asserted that this Amy character had been imitating her IP to shift blame onto her lap.
5189000	5193000	To those unfamiliar with IPs, this claim would seem quite unfalsifiable, although contentious.
5193000	5199000	However, people who are more technologically cultured swiftly descended on the holes within the besieged creator's exposition.
5199000	5203000	These emphasise the fact that besides it already being extremely difficult to mimic someone's IP,
5203000	5207000	as a person's IP often changes with time and is dependent on the devices one uses,
5207000	5213000	it makes the likelihood that a stalker had continuously tracked her IP even more unlikely, in fact nearly impossible.
5213000	5218000	In essence, a stalker of this degree would have needed to have used her devices to even begin mimicking her behaviour,
5218000	5224000	which we know hasn't happened given Shannon's own claims, so she kind of backed herself into a corner on that one.
5224000	5228000	Some also found it strange that she immediately assumed this was the doing of her mystery stalker,
5228000	5232000	and not the many other possibilities that could be drawn from such a bizarre situation.
5232000	5237000	In a way, her specificity became her downfall, as she was shown up as clearly lying about certain details,
5237000	5241000	and as she was lying about the explanation relating to who committed the incident in question,
5241000	5244000	the natural assumption was that she was probably the guilty party.
5244000	5249000	This only makes the community post more awkward to read, especially given how she uses a lot of linguistic devices
5249000	5253000	to convey an upfront nature, such as that acceptance that people may not believe it,
5253000	5259000	and even the expletives that would convey that sort of unfiltered emotion. Its contrivance couldn't be more crystalline.
5259000	5264000	It wasn't long until many critical comments appeared in the section of her community post chastising her for her dishonesty,
5264000	5269000	but also requesting some transparency. Her fans, although clearly possessing affection for their creator,
5269000	5275000	were also conscious that this was not the truth, and that they clearly deserved better from someone who thought she cared about them.
5275000	5280000	With the deception of these exploits on show, the question began to manifest of what other lies had been concocted
5280000	5285000	on the Creepshow art channel. After all, the scapegoat of this scenario, Amy, was an individual who Shannon acknowledged
5285000	5291000	more than readily as a real person for over two years. If she wasn't this bogeyman that Creepshow made her out to be,
5291000	5296000	who was she? In the week following, a tweet went up from a certain creator asking if Amy had been mentioned
5296000	5302000	prior to October 2018, with the theory that this character had been inspired by a conversation that they had had with her.
5302000	5307000	This creator was Emily Artful, a person mentioned multiple times in Shannon's supposed blog post.
5307000	5311000	It's clear the two knew of each other, but how deep did this rabbit hole go?
5311000	5316000	Well, if you shall permit, I'd like to bring another friend, my exemplary colleague and creator,
5316000	5322000	It's Rooster, to break down the details of what followed, in possibly one of the most aberrant twists yet. Take it away.
5330000	5337000	So James asked Scotland's finest to investigate the whole Amy situation, so here I am, procrastinating my uni deadlines
5337000	5339000	to talk about Creepshow art. Help me.
5339000	5346000	So in early January of 2019, Shannon uploaded an hour long video titled, I was stalked for 8 plus years.
5346000	5353000	In this video, Shannon details her horror story of being on the receiving end of a stalker for almost a decade of her life.
5353000	5357000	Using her platform to share her story of an issue estimated to affect somewhere between
5357000	5361000	6 to 7 and a half million people in just the US alone.
5361000	5370000	With further disturbing statistics suggesting that 1 in 6 women have experienced some form of stalking in their lifetime.
5370000	5374000	Stalking and many other factors why women don't feel safe walking home at night.
5374000	5380000	But what about Shannon? Well, Enter Stage left Emily Artful, who released a counter video against Shannon
5380000	5387000	and her video to send the internet into a meltdown. Shannon's I was stalked video has a runtime just shy of 60 minutes.
5388000	5392000	So let's condense this video down and then compare it to Emily Artful's story.
5392000	5396000	Because an hour is a long time, you could watch one of Trove's videos and that-
5398000	5400000	No you couldn't, you could not actually.
5400000	5408000	Hi, if you've read the title of this video, then you know that it's going to be about harassment and online stalking.
5408000	5415000	There are a lot, and I mean a lot, of videos on the internet where the person is crying about this story
5415000	5421000	and trying to retell how it sucks and I can tell you absolutely first hand, it does.
5421000	5426000	Shannon's opening statement claims she'd been on the receiving end of a stalker for the past 8 plus years
5426000	5430000	but knew who did this to her and that the whole thing was over.
5430000	5434000	She then goes into more details of her terror tale as follows.
5434000	5439000	She met her first online friend, Amy, who had a much cooler life than her.
5439000	5446000	Her life was the shit and mine was shit and I was so friggin jealous
5446000	5452000	and her parents allowing her to have a cell phone when mine wouldn't and I just had, I just had basically nothing.
5452000	5458000	However, Amy was getting more guys than she was, which led Shannon down the path of jealousy,
5458000	5461000	resulting in her starting to tell some porky pies.
5461000	5467000	She began to manipulate her life in fantasy tales to try level up to this new friend she made online.
5467000	5473000	These tales included love interests in Shannon's life, with some lies going as far as claims of men
5473000	5478000	climbing through Shannon's window to meet up with her at the crack of dawn.
5478000	5485000	I made a dumb decision. When talking to Amy, I started full online and making up shit to fit in with her,
5485000	5491000	which is exactly what Disney Channel tells you you shouldn't do because lying is wrong and don't ever do it.
5491000	5493000	Yes, I know Zendaya, I've heard you a million times.
5493000	5501000	But in order to fit in with Amy and seem cooler, I just started lying about everything, which was not a smart move to do
5501000	5509000	because I am in fact a shitty liar. I won't remember my lies very well and I tend to end up exposing my damn self,
5509000	5514000	which is why I try to keep my shit as honest as possible in my real life.
5514000	5522000	As time went on, her lies got more complex and irrational, to the point where she started mixing her fake partners and companions with real life friends.
5522000	5530000	Amy caught on that Shannon was being dishonest, but instead of giving it up and admitting it, Shannon instead made her lies even more far-fetched.
5530000	5539000	These lies got so out of control that Amy wanted to fight her real life friends because Shannon had orchestrated real people into fake problematic scenarios.
5539000	5546000	I wove these like intricate tales into my life. I had one character who was my next door neighbour,
5546000	5553000	who was essentially like a hot Archie Andrews kind of guy who was sweet and charming and our windows faced each other
5553000	5556000	and at the end of the night we would look out at each other and smile.
5556000	5562000	And I named him George, specifically after George Weasley, who I had the fattest crush on.
5562000	5567000	She then made her MySpace account and if you remember that, then how's your 30s treating you?
5567000	5574000	On this new platform, Amy noticed Shannon's friend Sage was on her top friends list, which annoyed Amy
5574000	5577000	because Sage was a friend of Shannon's who had been bitched about.
5577000	5583000	Amy was confused to why Sage was on that list after Shannon had made claims of problematic behaviour from them.
5583000	5587000	Sage then received a threatening email from Amy, claiming that they wanted to kill them.
5587000	5592000	This scenario led to a tearful phone call with Sage to Shannon, who was troubled about the email.
5592000	5596000	Shannon decided that enough was enough, so wrote a long email to Amy.
5596000	5603000	Coming clean with everything, Amy did not take this well and was understandably angered by Shannon's explanation.
5603000	5605000	After this, Shannon claimed she blocked Amy.
5605000	5612000	Things went quiet for a few months until they received an email from a fake account under a phony name along the lines of John Smith or something.
5612000	5614000	And it ain't David Tennant, trust me.
5614000	5619000	This email was insulting her friends and providing real life information about Shannon.
5619000	5624000	Then every couple of days she got more and more, with all the emails ending with the phrase, kill yourself.
5624000	5629000	She then switched to Facebook and wasn't too clever with her privacy settings on this account.
5629000	5632000	She continued to get emails for months upon months.
5632000	5636000	During these pressing times, she also briefly describes her battles with homelessness.
5660000	5668000	Her boyfriend, Anthony, then started getting texts from Amy, reading that they should break up with Shannon.
5668000	5672000	When he brought this up with her, she returned to her old tricks and lied to Anthony.
5672000	5682000	Anthony knew this was all fabricated, which led to Shannon eventually breaking down after realising that she had been trapped, forcing to confess everything to Anthony.
5682000	5684000	Amy wasn't backing down though, however.
5684000	5690000	Shannon was threatened with revenge, also claiming that Amy had threatened her to get her fired from her job.
5690000	5694000	You might be thinking, go to the police, make YouTube videos.
5694000	5699000	Well, she admits that she was so shit scared she slept on her bathroom floor some nights.
5699000	5704000	But you also may be thinking at this point, where's the evidence, as I haven't presented any of yet.
5704000	5709000	Well, Shannon claims to have deleted every email she received from Amy.
5709000	5713000	Rendering any efforts to take this situation to the police useless.
5713000	5718000	During these stressful times, she was encouraged to search her emails for any form of evidence.
5739000	5766000	She found Amy's social media accounts with one that was still active.
5766000	5771000	So she decided to finally take accountability, kind of.
5771000	5774000	They then video called and Amy came clean with everything.
5774000	5778000	Claiming she took her marriage stress and anger out on Shannon.
5778000	5782000	Shannon tells Amy that she can't forgive her or be friends, but they stay in touch.
5782000	5788000	She then told her audience that it wasn't really that deep and not to go out their way trying to find out who she was.
5788000	5792000	Also clarifying that she asked Amy permission to share the story.
5792000	5798000	After this, Shannon received support from her fans in the comments and I'm sure from friends behind the scenes too.
5823000	5826000	But nothing else really came from it.
5826000	5830000	Well, I mean obviously it didn't until June 12th 2021.
5830000	5833000	When in light of lolcow allegations and their own research.
5833000	5838000	A creator by the name of Emily Artful decided to upload a video titled.
5838000	5841000	Creepshow art has always been this way.
5852000	5859000	Six years and several years prior I had been facing stalking, harassment, and threats from one very recognizable source.
5859000	5862000	For many years I had no idea who this person was.
5862000	5865000	I had speculations, but they were pretty far off.
5865000	5868000	And because of that I had to endure that abuse.
5868000	5870000	I went to the police, I was turned away.
5870000	5873000	I spoke to an attorney, they told me it's not going to be worth it taking it to court.
5873000	5877000	This story is long, so I recommend you watch it at one and a half speed if you can.
5877000	5881000	It's long because this stalking campaign has lasted the better part of a decade.
5881000	5883000	And while I didn't know who my stalker was before.
5883000	5885000	Now I know who my stalker is.
5885000	5887000	My stalker is Shannon, better known as creepshow art.
5887000	5890000	And what I believe to be her current husband Anthony Parker.
5890000	5893000	Who is also my abusive ex partner.
5893000	5897000	I have to say for legal purposes that everything in this video is alleged.
5897000	5900000	I just encourage people to look at the evidence and form their own opinions.
5900000	5904000	I also want to say I originally censored Anthony's name in this video.
5904000	5906000	I called him Andrew.
5906000	5908000	Just kind of out of a habit.
5908000	5910000	But I decided I'm not going to do that anymore.
5910000	5912000	His handle online is Anthony Parker.
5912000	5917000	And he raped me and he emotionally abused me and manipulated me when I was most vulnerable.
5917000	5920000	And for the better part of the decade he tried to make my life a living hell.
5920000	5922000	Thank you everyone and here's the video.
5924000	5929000	Emily prefaces her story by admitting that when this situation started she was a toxic person.
5929000	5932000	And often made crude comments towards others.
5932000	5938000	In her own words, an anti-SJW pick me girl who was often fatphobic and would slut shame others.
5938000	5944000	Emily admits that she was that person in the past and still is but has grown up as a person since then.
5944000	5950000	So this all started when Emily started making music and had a gig booked in the Nickel City venue.
5950000	5953000	Who let any shitty bands perform in Emily's own words.
5953000	5960000	I was a gig musician making shit all doing that because I still lived at home and I was a student.
5961000	5966000	I took a gig performing at Nickel City Arcade in San Jose.
5966000	5973000	Because they used to allow the shittiest of bands to perform in their literal birthday room.
5973000	5977000	After performing in their birthday room, she met a man who attended the gig.
5977000	5979000	And his name was Anthony.
5979000	5985000	Emily and Anthony hit it off well with each other and ended up in a relationship that Emily describes as toxic.
5985000	5990000	During this time of her life, Emily had a big drug problem and struggled heavily with it.
5990000	6000000	Emily claims Anthony showed signs of being abusive early on, often punching walls in anger and thinking he and a small friend group from school were the intellectuals.
6000000	6006000	Things began to get progressively worse after Anthony spotted a comment that Emily posted on a gay friend's post.
6006000	6010000	The comment was complimenting a friend and wasn't flirtatious in any way.
6010000	6014000	However, Anthony was deeply insecure and couldn't understand this.
6014000	6025000	It's also worth knowing that when this happened, at the time Anthony had been cheating on Emily secretly as he was often flirty with other women and sent naughty foes to people too.
6025000	6033000	In anger, he got one of his friends, Brandon, to send Emily horrible, abusive messages, going as far to threaten to curb stomp her.
6033000	6037000	After the breakup, they decided to keep a professional relationship in the arts industry.
6037000	6042000	And Anthony wanted Emily to provide vocals for one of his songs and she was keen to do so.
6042000	6049000	Andrew actually reached back out to me down the road, basically saying, hey, sorry for how things ended, we should be friends now.
6049000	6057000	Then, of course, as all codependent relationships do, we entered into this kind of weird middle ground flirtationship.
6057000	6062000	That became unhealthy, so I decided to kind of end it, kind of step back away from that.
6062000	6069000	Then he expressed interest in having a professional relationship, having me sing on one of his tracks.
6069000	6083000	However, when watching back a music video of Anthony she was acting in, she heard the vocals of another female who she took a quick dislike to, claiming to Anthony that she could sing a lot better and that person behind the microphone wasn't good.
6083000	6101000	However, this person happened to be Shannon.
6101000	6118000	Emily reflects back on her opening statement here, admitting that the comment she made was toxic and rude, but claims this behaviour was caused due to abusive male figures being in her life at the time, alongside Anthony, but also admits that during this period of her life, she was heavily drugged up and trapped in addiction.
6118000	6122000	After this comment was made, this started a long chain of events to follow.
6149000	6154000	Though negative comments are common on YouTube, these ones seemed suspicious.
6154000	6160000	She also began to get friend requests on Facebook from people with mutual friends, so she accepted them not thinking much about it.
6160000	6169000	Emily believes that Anthony and Shannon were working together to try and get more information about her, but notes that she isn't certain that Shannon was involved at this point.
6169000	6177000	Emily's Facebook account was hacked after it was phished, locking her out completely, and phishing is a tactic to hack people by seeming trustworthy with a link shared.
6177000	6185000	These are very common nowadays, you've probably had these before where a friend sends you a sussy link with a message along the lines of like, is this you in this video?
6185000	6188000	Ah shit, I got a virus now.
6188000	6196000	But this hack led to compromising photos being stolen from her account in private logs, but some of these photos were from when Emily was a minor.
6196000	6208000	When she expressed this concern to the account that they were storing CP, they just called Emily a liar and instead baited her by putting them alongside other photos in a photo bucket to taunt her and hold them over her head.
6226000	6232000	I had that original Facebook account since I was a minor, since Facebook came out.
6232000	6247000	And hidden in the messages of that account were some compromising photographs. Now most of them were of me as an adult, but unfortunately, there were a few of me as a minor.
6247000	6256000	And I tried to express that to my stalker several times, but they just disregarded it and said that I was a liar.
6256000	6262000	The comments continued to surface, but this time they were a lot more personal and direct towards her physical appearance.
6262000	6269000	At this time she had been struggling with an ED and was underweight and overweight at points in her life, which the comments made digs at.
6269000	6274000	There were also some comments suggesting that she was transgender in a transphobic delivery.
6274000	6289000	Let me just say right now, the number one insult, this is how I know it's her, across the board, because you know everybody is haters, but I know it's her when I'm called pre-op or T-R-A-N-N-Y slur.
6289000	6299000	Or when did you get your operation and do you still have boy parts down there? Just lots of incredibly transphobic insults.
6299000	6307000	Emily at this point in life was not in control due to drug problems, but was on the mend, so decided to try and make things work by getting a job.
6307000	6320000	On the road to recovery, she was sabotaged by her harassers who found out where she was working and sent them an email posing as a past client claiming that they lost her business and attached photos of Emily in compromising positions.
6320000	6324000	Emily was then fired from her job and ended up on the street for a short period of time.
6324000	6334000	Continuing her path to recovery though, things looked up when she met someone new and moved in with them and also secured a new job and began to settle down after having a child with her partner.
6334000	6345000	Anthony and allegedly Shannon did everything they could think of to try to continue to fuck with her by trying to find out where her new workplace was and at the time only knowing it was a restaurant.
6345000	6358000	To try and find this information out, they stole Emily's friends photos on Facebook and created a fake account posing as a new account due to the last one being hacked and had added Emily's friends too to look more legit.
6358000	6367000	Emily believed this so accepted the friend request, but then she noticed her posts were oddly sus, asking people if they knew any nice restaurants in the area.
6367000	6377000	Hey, does anybody know of any really cool, this specific type of cuisine restaurants in this specific location?
6377000	6385000	And at that point I'm like, you are not my friend. And so I blocked them. I knew right away that they were trying to find out where I work.
6385000	6392000	They wanted to try to bait me to be like, yeah, I work here so that they could call and get me fired from another job.
6392000	6400000	And after a report, the account was removed. Things were looking up though. She was healing, moving forward in life and soon started her EmilyArful channel.
6400000	6409000	Unfortunately for Emily, things were only going to get worse though and this started when she noticed an increase of negative comments on her channel.
6409000	6420000	And for the first time, Emily realized that she had a stalker. After this happened, she began to notice comments which were specifically detailed about Creepshow Art, who at the time Emily didn't know was Shannon.
6420000	6432000	She decided to approach Shannon about it, politely. Emily claims that at the time she couldn't find anyone else apart from Shannon using the city's title, but admits that she was still green on the platform and perhaps didn't look hard enough.
6432000	6443000	Hi Shannon, my name is Emily and I have a channel on YouTube called EmilyArful. It's been brought to my attention that you have a series with the exact same name as a series I created three years ago called Sketchbook Storytime.
6443000	6454000	I'm going to guess this was most likely 100% by accidents or by coincidence, but I put my heart and soul into my series and I'd really really appreciate if you were able to change the name of your storytime videos.
6454000	6462000	You are completely within your right not to as it's your channel and you can do with it as you please, but from one artist to another, I hope you understand how it can hurt my business.
6462000	6471000	I hope you understand my requests and I hope you don't think I'm angry. Things like this happen all the time. I figure it's just a coincidence. Thank you, Emily.
6471000	6484000	And Shannon responded, sorry man, I watched Lehman Raptor on YouTube and she has a series titled The Same Name and she gave me a go ahead. I'll just label them as storytime since that's all it is, but I appreciate you letting me know your concern.
6484000	6493000	Looking into it, there are quite a few accounts using the same name for similar series. Kind of like Get Ready For Me for beauty YouTubers almost.
6493000	6498000	I think at the very least you might have started a trend, which is commendable. Sorry I made you uncomfortable in any way my dude.
6498000	6509000	After this, Emily followed Creepshow on Instagram and was stunned to see a drawing on the account that scarily resembled Anthony a lot, but confirmed this when the post had Anthony tagged in it.
6509000	6517000	At this point, Emily was worried about Shannon because she knew Anthony well and how abusive he had been towards her. She decided to unfollow Creepshow.
6517000	6532000	Emily claims here that she doesn't have much receipts because at the time she just wanted to block the pair and push them away as far as possible until she had a conversation with a lawyer in 2017 who told her to do the exact opposite and collect evidence against them.
6532000	6544000	Emily had started a new series, Sketchbook Storytype, where she talked about past experiences of her life and one of her videos went semi-viral as she called it, so she posted the achievement onto Twitter and as a thank you to her fans.
6544000	6553000	After she tweeted this, she was followed by Anthony, who proceeded to reply to the achievement, accusing her of buying views and also calling her out for blocking him too.
6553000	6564000	Emily noticed just short moments after this was tweeted towards her, a new account DMed her under the handle NotViralEmily, saying the same sort of thing and sending pictures of a Socialblade page.
6564000	6575000	Now, for the non-nerds out there, a Socialblade page is a place where a YouTuber can take tabs of their past analytics and growth. Essentially, it's a platform for YouTubers to jerk themselves off to.
6575000	6586000	Emily tried to level with Anthony and reach a softer side because she was terrified of him because he'd mentioned dark things such as shooting up schools before, going as far to plot out who he would have killed.
6586000	6597000	She genuinely was scared he was going to come and kill her. Emily was haunted to the point which led her to write up a statement, that if anything mysterious happened to her, it was most likely Anthony who did it.
6616000	6629000	After this situation happened, she began to suspect Anthony was the one who had been stalking her for the past few years but couldn't prove it at this point.
6629000	6642000	So, she decided to plan out a trap to lay out for Anthony to gather evidence. She set this trap by posing as a hater of her own channel, messaging Anthony with a trackable link, baiting him to click on it.
6642000	6653000	He was baited. Because Emily had two mutual friends with Anthony, she knew where he was living at the time and the link brought her to the location of where Anthony lived in San Jose, California.
6653000	6664000	As I mentioned previously, things got progressively worse. But things took a new level when she received anxiety-drilling Snapchats from a sock puppet account, as the stalker was now in her town.
6664000	6685000	One day I just received a completely random Snapchat photograph of what looked like a specific square in the city that I lived in, with some nonsensical text overlaid on top.
6685000	6701000	I don't have the initial Snapchat because I just kind of froze in panic, but I do have the response to that Snapchat. I wrote, are you in my city? And Kilgore Trout is the name that they chose this time.
6701000	6709000	And they said, somewhere I suppose in its labyrinth. And then you can see I started typing back, you are fucking insane.
6709000	6721000	Now I'm sorry for the ableist language I was using here. I was just, I was so freaked out. You guys have no idea the level of fear that I had in this moment.
6721000	6730000	I was 100% convinced that this person, Andrew or Shannon or whoever, was in my city and they were going to hurt me.
6730000	6738000	You can see I said, answer me. You drove all the way here and they said, I don't have a driver's license yet, my parents drove me here.
6738000	6750000	Emily notes here that they started scattering breadcrumbs of the stalker being a potential minor by claiming their parents drove them to the town, almost in an attempt to draw Emily's suspicions away of it being Anthony.
6750000	6758000	Emily also claims that post high school, the pair had conversations discussing kidnapping people who bullied him in school and torturing them.
6758000	6766000	At the same time, Emily was trying to be kind to Anthony and find a soft spot once more as she was genuinely concerned for her own wellbeing.
6766000	6774000	Telling Anthony not to come to her house, trying to scare him off by claiming she had a security dog and a loaded weapon ready to use for protection.
6774000	6780000	Emily then asked him if he was near the loft, a venue, as she recognised the architecture of her own town.
6780000	6797000	There is alas only one loft, infinite copies of voids upon voids, reflected as it were into the greater void of perception, that which is named but not known, in which loft is one of any possible combination of voids, infinite yet also distinct.
6797000	6806000	He followed with more snaps, criticising her channel by essentially saying you're adding shit content to the internet in this nonsensical text he wrote towards her.
6806000	6815000	All art reflects the greater void of human limitations. Alas, Mother's Day cards and subscriber drawings are no exception.
6815000	6823000	Only the mind-bending, thumb-bending video can transcend this void through its sheer bendry and avant-gardeness.
6823000	6833000	It's important to note here that he mentioned subscriber drawings and something key to mention, how did he get this Snapchat account and how was he able to send it to them?
6833000	6843000	Emily answers this on another content creators video claiming that she was public with her Snapchat and she did this as she used it as an outlet for fans to send their own fanart to her.
6843000	6848000	So this explains how Anthony was able to contact Emily without being a friend.
6848000	6853000	Emily explains that she knows who is behind the Snapchat account and it was Anthony because he clicked on the link she sent.
6853000	6860000	To which again, he responds in more gibberish and takes no accountability or even defends himself.
6860000	6863000	Further down the path, the Rewired Soul drama happened.
6863000	6871000	YouTubers such as Primink have covered this in much more depth but the main issue with him was that he started out as a mental health channel and Emily befriended him.
6871000	6876000	But then he started making videos about YouTubers breakdowns and diagnosing them.
6876000	6881000	This in itself is very distasteful but he made this worse by making multiple videos on them.
6881000	6887000	Just a few examples, he has over 500 videos just like these about every YouTuber you can think of.
6887000	6897000	And these videos aren't like a one off and done. He has 65 videos on Shane Dawson, 45 videos on Jake Paul, 16 videos on Tana Mongeau, 15 videos on Trisha Paytas.
6897000	6898000	It goes on and on.
6898000	6900000	At some point it becomes kind of obsessive.
6900000	6908000	Just imagine, some random guy on the internet making 65 videos on how you need to get help in therapy or about how your relationships are failing.
6908000	6916000	But this didn't stop another sort of puppet account from DMing her a lot of abuse and threats because Emily had previous associations with him.
6916000	6924000	Since I had publicly, I think I had just tweeted at him a few times so people were aware that him and I had talked.
6924000	6932000	During that whole debacle I got a DM on Twitter from someone named Dat Boy.
6932000	6941000	And they say, uh oh dear, looks like you're friends with a fraud. Do you want to be hurt in the worst possible way?
6941000	6947000	Somebody is a bad mommy. Maybe we let everyone know how bad of a mommy you are.
6947000	6951000	Keep telling people you're sober girl. Maybe if you say it enough people will believe it.
6951000	6958000	Have fun endorsing your fraud druggie bitch. Have fun faking your sobriety for your mindless followers.
6958000	6965000	They believe you but no one else does my dear. You bad mommy. I've got receipts druggie bitch with a winky face.
6965000	6972000	Emily also mentions comments made towards her children that seem like threats against them or threats to get her kids taken away from her.
6972000	6975000	And she backs us up with another incident with Shannon.
6975000	6982000	Emily did a Halloween shoot with a short 3 series video claiming it to be fun and off brand compared to her usual content.
6982000	6988000	After she posted these she noticed the same comment being spammed claiming to be grossed out that Emily would monetize her kids.
6988000	6993000	Trying to compare this fleeting moment to people who very much monetize their children.
6993000	7004000	But for some reason I just kept getting the same comment over and over and over. Oh my god aren't you guys so like grossed out that she's trying to monetize her kids?
7004000	7013000	Like oh my gosh she's just shoving her kids down our throat and I'm sorry to have that like accusation lobbed at me was frustrating.
7013000	7018000	Emily then made a Redbubble shirt with her son on it to keep one for herself and send one to her dad.
7018000	7022000	She claims to have never advertised this and it was a private project.
7022000	7030000	This was a point that Shannon made on a lolcow post trying to further slander Emily that she was a disgusting human for making merch out of her children.
7030000	7033000	And essentially tried to call her out for exploiting them.
7033000	7041000	I never made that public like I never advertised it as merch. I put that in my Redbubble shop and ordered two of those shirts.
7041000	7047000	One to send to my dad and one to send to my best friend because obviously they love my son.
7047000	7051000	So somewhere between the Rewired Soul incident and the lolcow Halloween situation,
7051000	7054000	Emily received a DM from an account under Britafilter.
7054000	7058000	The account claimed that Emily did not know her but that Brita knew her.
7058000	7064000	In short, the DM details that her brother was a fan of hers and has archives on his computer of Emily's media.
7064000	7071000	Claiming that he has an obsession, pages of screen names and information on Emily and info that someone wouldn't want to know.
7071000	7074000	The account said that he had harassed her with accounts under Ava.
7074000	7079000	Which sounds like an auto correction for Adria, the person behind the not viral Emily account.
7079000	7085000	The message continues claiming that he had many saw puppet accounts and even reached out to her followers.
7085000	7090000	She claims she found all this while using her computer for school work and that's when she found everything.
7090000	7097000	And that she has taken the laptop to his parents and has decided to encourage her brother to take a mental health facility and to be cut off from this.
7097000	7100000	She apologizes on behalf and claims that he was just a kid at 15.
7100000	7109000	I am sorry for doing this anonymously but because my brother is a child, my parents have told me not to speak out about this with anyone else outside of family.
7109000	7116000	I know that must be inherently frustrating for you but it's important to me that you at least know that this problem was seen and will be taken care of.
7116000	7126000	In response to the long winded DM, Emily asked to solidify the statement by asking the girl to come into a video call as she found the information being presented very suspicious.
7126000	7132000	Claiming it to be very strange that he wrote every little specific detail such as him getting Emily fired from her job.
7132000	7140000	Would you be able to do me a favor so I know this is all real? I need to see slash talk to you on video chat, Snapchat, Instagram, Skype, it doesn't matter.
7140000	7146000	Because all this information seems suspicious to me. It's exactly what's happened to me to a T.
7146000	7153000	Obviously with a huge handful of things missing and some things that I didn't even know that they had on me.
7153000	7162000	At the time this had been happening for 5 years making the boy in question 10 years old. Would a 10 year old even be capable of doing any of this?
7162000	7168000	Emily claims to be certain it's Anthony and doubts that they were able to fulfill her video chat request.
7168000	7173000	And sure enough the account responded bluntly stating that if she doesn't believe her then that's fine.
7173000	7177000	And also swiftly declined claiming that her parents aren't comfortable with that.
7177000	7185000	Now we know he got you fired and information of the like. He's a video of you crying where you state someone got you fired and text documents of him taking credit for it.
7185000	7193000	Though I doubt I will be able to convince you that this is legitimate. I do hope that you find peace with this and I understand the trust is not here.
7193000	7199000	After this happened Emily uploaded a video where she discussed a YouTuber who would cause her a lot of problems.
7199000	7204000	That wasn't about Shannon but she later had to private it due to it causing a lot of issues with her friends.
7204000	7210000	But she noticed a sprinkle of sock puppet accounts claiming it to be about creep show art. Crap show art in fact.
7210000	7212000	Shannon's post reads,
7234000	7241000	Also she felt betrayed because I stopped responding to her emails after a while.
7241000	7251000	Because of her harassing me, my boyfriend, my friends, and sometimes going as far as to try to get me fired, I don't trust people very easily online.
7251000	7254000	Isn't that a coinkydink?
7254000	7266000	That right there is the most passive aggressive shit I have ever read and is also one of the many breadcrumbs that she started leaving behind that she had a quote unquote stalker named Amy.
7266000	7275000	Shannon came across as super manipulative in trying to get herself out of this messy situation in her response, apologising for going off but Emily wasn't having any of it.
7275000	7278000	She snapped and confronted her.
7279000	7287000	Emily opens bluntly asking if it was her or Anthony stalking her and compiles the proof we have gathered already in this text.
7287000	7294000	She also mentioned that she baited the Lilly Singh account with another IP link which led her to the new location which they had moved to.
7294000	7301000	And that one of the IPs she had previously tracked, tracked her back to a library which does line up with Anthony's homeless lifestyle.
7301000	7309000	Now interestingly enough, one of the IPs that I had tracked to where they had lived before was from a library.
7309000	7320000	Come to find out that when Shannon and Andrew were living in their car, they had used a library for their internet access which I now know from watching some of Shannon's older videos.
7320000	7334000	Because when you live in a car, you don't have very basic things. For a living room, you have a Starbucks or a library because you can sit there essentially the entire day and no one cares.
7334000	7348000	So what our schedule basically was on a day to day basis was basically to get food at about 9am or so and make our way over to the library and set up so we could essentially work till about 2 or 3 and then get food again.
7348000	7353000	And then come back and work till about, I don't remember if it was 9pm or 10pm when it closed.
7353000	7357000	Shannon responds bluntly with, um, literally neither of us do.
7357000	7362000	Emily responds by asking why her boyfriend went off of her and accused her of buying views and subs.
7362000	7368000	Shannon is apologetic that those things happened but bitter that Emily would accuse them of stalking, claiming that it isn't cool.
7368000	7377000	In an effort to try and cover up the sub buying comments, Shannon claims that she herself had received DMs saying similar and that other accounts had too.
7377000	7382000	And claimed that the account had actually messaged her with dirt on Emily from before Emily Artful.
7382000	7385000	But then Emily pleased with Shannon for the pair to leave her alone.
7385000	7390000	Finding it strange how she had zero contact with Anthony, then all of a sudden he's blowing her up on Twitter.
7390000	7396000	Shannon continues by insisting it's not Anthony and offers a Skype or FaceTime call with Emily.
7396000	7402000	Shannon again denies the allegations, claiming she'd received DMs from an account something like Filter.
7402000	7412000	Now if we go back to the sus account that DMed Emily under Brita Filter, this does seem oddly convenient and how the fuck would she remember that?
7412000	7416000	Shannon then tries to level with Emily, exclaiming that she gets where she's coming from.
7416000	7422000	Detailing her story of how she was harassed by a girl called Amy who catfished her for 12 years.
7422000	7428000	Emily replies here, dismissing her attempts to cover up by claiming she's in the works filling out a restraining order.
7428000	7434000	She says she's taken this to the police with the evidence but will not press charges as she doesn't want to hurt or ruin anyone's life.
7434000	7443000	Emily then details the progress of the private investigation that would IP block them from contact and makes a point that if it's not her then she has nothing to worry about.
7443000	7450000	Emily, possibly in fear, starts the backtrack and dismisses herself by saying that if she's wrong about this then she does apologise.
7450000	7460000	At this point Emily is talking to a brick wall. Shannon tells Emily to go ahead with the restraining order but once again mentions the music video, which confused Anthony.
7460000	7464000	She uses this in an effort to continue to try and clean their names.
7464000	7471000	Emily finds it strange that she was able to recall the music video so easily considering it was a long time ago.
7471000	7478000	Emily softens for Shannon furthermore by expressing worries she had been associated with Anthony due to the abuse she suffered.
7478000	7484000	Shannon once more tries to persuade Emily that Anthony would never do that due to the sheer amount of respect she has for him.
7484000	7493000	Emily claims she suspected it to be Anthony and Brandon for a while, causing Creepshow to pounce on that statement and try to put all the blame on her friend Brandon.
7493000	7504000	Going on further stating that last year Brandon tried to get Emily fired because Anthony chose her over him and that he had been trying to dip into the art YouTube world but it hadn't been going well for him.
7504000	7508000	Emily asks where Brandon lives now to which Shannon claims she didn't know.
7508000	7517000	There's some back and forth conversation figuring out where Brandon lived and Emily states that she would be taking that information to the PI but really hoped it's not her or Anthony.
7517000	7521000	Shannon tells Emily to be safe and that if it was Brandon they had nothing to do with it.
7521000	7525000	Emily tries to end the conversation wishing them both nothing but happiness from the bottom of her heart.
7525000	7527000	Shannon responds by claiming back at you.
7527000	7534000	She tells Emily that if she ever needs any more information about the three of them but or to clear their names then to let her know.
7534000	7539000	Emily then asks for an address to serve them with papers but backs down and is worried that she has the wrong people.
7539000	7542000	To which Shannon offers to send them a PO box.
7542000	7548000	Emily explains that she feels very emotional about this and is thankful for the help but still has high suspicions.
7548000	7555000	I 100% was still convinced it was them at this point and this is something I've had to work on in therapy.
7555000	7564000	I am a weak-willed person if you are nice to me I will fold like a house of cards and I was also still considerably afraid of both of them at this point.
7564000	7572000	So whenever they would show me like a sliver of humanity I would just cling to it because I just wanted everything to be over I just wanted to be left alone.
7572000	7575000	Emily claims at this point she was left unsure what to do.
7575000	7581000	Spend loads of money on legal action which she would struggle to afford or spend it on something fun with her kids.
7581000	7585000	But she decided it wasn't worth it so laid low and started to post again.
7585000	7591000	And then she began to notice all the comments specifically Anthony's trolling suddenly disappeared.
7591000	7596000	To which Emily claims this solidifies that her stalker was Anthony and Shannon.
7596000	7605000	The silence was brief however as she received a DM from an account claiming that a lolcow post from Shannon was posting old videos of Emily to an archived YouTube channel.
7605000	7616000	Emily heavily notes here that this might not be Shannon at all but finds the humour in the account dating back to 2017 and that it was still active similar to Anthony and Shannon's.
7616000	7622000	These videos had gameplay or stills with the audio over them with Emily expressing takes that could be seen as controversial now.
7622000	7630000	Emily thinks that this could have been an effort to try and scare her into thinking she would get cancelled but Emily says that she will always admit when she's wrong about something.
7630000	7642000	In closing this segment up it's important to talk about her follow up video very briefly in which she provided a lot more evidence to her pre-existing receipts as well as additional ones to help fight her case.
7642000	7654000	She then addresses the twitter DMs by recording her phone to prove their legitimacy and adds a very good point to the case by recalling a time where Shannon showed herself receiving a DM from the salt puppet account.
7654000	7660000	So this account was the one that was featured in one of Shannon's videos.
7660000	7670000	At least one person in this galaxy thinks I bought my views and I bought my subscribers.
7670000	7683000	Which means someone in this galaxy thinks I'm made of such wealth and such opulence that I bought myself subscribers.
7683000	7687000	The same account that DMed Emily claiming that Creepshow Art was copying her.
7687000	7694000	Emily also stresses that she wasn't nitpicking every hate comment she received and labelling it from Anthony or Shannon.
7694000	7705000	It's common for a channel to receive hate but Emily describes normal hate comments being more against her content while comments she suspected to be the pair were more tailored around Emily's physical appearance.
7705000	7713000	She shows video evidence of the instagram DMs with Shannon and then goes onto messenger to show evidence of the message she received on messenger.
7713000	7723000	That's mainly what this video's purpose was, however it does add additional strong points against the mysterious account that DMed Emily about the whole brother obsession situation.
7723000	7727000	Now this is a super important piece of evidence that I stumbled upon.
7727000	7737000	When Britafilter messaged me and went through the laundry list of harassment that I had endured, they mentioned having a grainy video of me singing and playing piano.
7737000	7744000	That video is an unlisted video and the only person I've ever sent the link to was Anthony.
7744000	7751000	That video is still on my YouTube channel to this very day, I never deleted it.
7751000	7763000	Emily ends the video here expressing that she's been left traumatised from this entire stalking burden that's been hanging over her life for the past 12 years and that it's caused her new physical mental health symptoms.
7763000	7778000	It's crazy to me that YouTube, a platform that once started out with content such as funny bowl haircut man can turn so dark in such a short span of time and it really is an eye opener just to show how terrifying the world we live in can get.
7778000	7784000	It's important to look at things from both sides, but in my opinion, Emily has a much stronger case against Shannon.
7784000	7795000	But anyway, that's my babbling time up now. If you don't mind me, I'm gonna go rot my brain with that essay that I've been procrastinating while editing this video. Oh no.
7796000	7806000	For the remainder of last year, all seemed quiet on the Western front, with many assuming that Creepshow's extended hiatus was for good reason.
7806000	7811000	And in a way, it certainly does, and I doubt anyone was planning on welcoming them back too readily.
7811000	7817000	However, many did wonder if she even intended to have a say in her own fate, or at least explain the reasoning behind her actions.
7817000	7820000	If she had the opportunity, what would she say to the viewers?
7820000	7830000	Well, this video is being made for posterity, to show I didn't do what I was accused of, and to show that what Emily has accused me and my husband of not only never happened to her, but could not have happened.
7830000	7836000	This video is being made to simply defend my and my husband's name, and prove we did not do the things we were accused of.
7836000	7843000	On the 31st of December 2021, Creepshow posted a modest little return video spanning two and a half hours with the charming title,
7843000	7849000	The Lies of Emily Artful, parentheses with evidence, just so you know that there will be bombshells dropped.
7849000	7855000	However, rather than a shot at redemption, this Creepshow video was much more a kamikaze mission. Allow me to explain why.
7855000	7859000	I have learned that the only people I can count on in my life are the people who actually know me,
7859000	7868000	and if a random person comes online and states I stalked them with quite sincerely no evidence, and literally posts on their active accounts that disprove that,
7868000	7873000	people I genuinely admired and loved would just go with it.
7873000	7879000	The main creators of a response video is at least about some sort of way back, even if they know that it'll never make things the way they used to be.
7879000	7883000	They want to show that they are a better person in spite of the wrongdoings they have committed.
7883000	7886000	I think everyone at least deserves one chance to make a case for themselves.
7886000	7889000	But from the first impression of this video, it's clear we're not going to receive that.
7889000	7895000	The thumbnail and title is already shifting focus towards this one event, which although not in insignificant detail,
7895000	7897000	was still only a part of a much greater story.
7897000	7903000	What about the forum incident, for example, and the subsequent community post explanation that still doesn't hold up under any form of scrutiny?
7903000	7906000	These are questions that are not answered in Creepshow Art's video.
7906000	7909000	If you're looking for any form of closure, then this is not going to happen.
7909000	7914000	Instead, we have a video that focuses on and attacks Emily Artful's testimony and reputation from every angle,
7914000	7918000	providing receipts which, on the surface, could appear to contradict her story on certain fronts.
7918000	7921000	The problem? Well, it's a Creepshow Art video.
7921000	7928000	One thing that Emily states in her video is that online harassment was never leveled at her until after she started working with Anthony professionally.
7928000	7936000	I had like a separate art account that was unrelated, a music account, and I started noticing a lot of really negative comments.
7936000	7943000	I didn't think much of it because that's just kind of, you know, the business on social media is you get negative comments.
7943000	7947000	I figured it was normal. I was just seeing an increased volume in them.
7947000	7952000	Now, to fully bring this video into context, it's really important to remember what Emily actually accused Shannon of,
7952000	7955000	because at the end of the day, that's what an audience is interested in.
7955000	7959000	Emily said a lot in her video, but the general gist was that Shannon had stalked and harassed Emily,
7959000	7963000	and then made a video to wash her own hands of the misdeeds she had committed,
7963000	7966000	and to take control of the narrative that was never hers to make in the first place.
7966000	7970000	How does Creepshow deal with this? Well, terribly, to be frank.
7970000	7975000	The whole premise of the video is an immediate misfire, because a lot of what Shannon says is based on the fact that her word,
7975000	7980000	and the word of those around her, is reliable, when she still hasn't absolved herself from lying to her audience
7980000	7984000	about previous incidents that seem intertwined with this one, including the Amy situation,
7984000	7987000	which is integral to the case she makes in this video as well.
7987000	7991000	Shannon does discuss this, but once again, only as a vehicle to discredit Emily,
7991000	7994000	when in reality, she should have been focusing on building up her own credibility first,
7994000	7998000	because it wasn't long until the cracks in these character assassinations started to show.
7998000	8003000	If I wanted to cancel Emily, as they say I did, I would have just made a video of the screenshots
8003000	8007000	of her taking photos of other women in public, making fun of their bodies, and posting them saying,
8007000	8014000	that'll do, pig, that'll do. Or, fat girls piss me off. Or, funny women are Jews, the rest are all our slur,
8014000	8018000	and we laugh out as to your disappointment. Or even her saying, on a post of an Antarctic teenage girl,
8018000	8023000	that she's skinnier than her. I didn't make a video on that because I didn't know those things until now.
8023000	8026000	Now, normally when dealing with a video of this sort of length and designed impact,
8026000	8031000	I dedicate a good amount of time to deconstructing it, but this video is deceptively lightweight,
8031000	8036000	and Creepshow's incensed tone can't disguise that. There are a lot of details designed to solely attack
8036000	8042000	Emily's credibility, much of which is just not worth addressing, and the stuff that is, is still executed poorly.
8042000	8046000	This part is going to be brief, but Amy is not a reference to Emily. Amy is a girl who used to harass me online,
8046000	8050000	who I originally met on Stardoll.com when I was in middle school. As I say in the video,
8050000	8053000	but Amy did not grow up in San Jose with me, we never knew each other personally,
8053000	8056000	and she was someone I strictly knew online, who lived states away from me.
8056000	8061000	Take for example, Amy, a person who, after ten parts, is addressed in a section where Shannon claims
8061000	8066000	that Emily had misattributed her experience with this individual, who is very real, as shown by emails.
8066000	8070000	Now, we know that the harassment that Shannon claims to have suffered at the hands of this individual
8070000	8074000	is undocumented because of Shannon's tendency to delete harassing emails, nonetheless,
8074000	8078000	she does provide evidence of communication with a person called Amy. With everything in mind,
8078000	8084000	the most this could do is prove that Amy is a different person to Shannon, but at least it presents an alternative explanation, right?
8084000	8087000	Well, there is one key detail to keep in mind here.
8087000	8094000	In order to prove my case, here are the cringy emails that Amy and I sent to each other in middle school.
8094000	8100000	In some of these emails, this individual signs off as Amy, a name that Shannon claimed to have concocted
8100000	8106000	after the incident to protect this individual's privacy, so either Shannon was lying there, or she was lying here.
8106000	8111000	Either way, once again, she lied, and for a person who is trying to use their credibility to fortify their case,
8111000	8116000	this is a rather abject failure. So let's turn our attention to the other accusation made against Shannon,
8116000	8122000	that being of the actual stalking she was allowed to have perpetuated before hijacking the story as her own.
8122000	8128000	As always, the principle of innocent until proven guilty should prevail, but by god does Shannon not make it easy
8128000	8133000	for any of her supporters, going through details whose relevance ranges from questionable to completely unnecessary,
8133000	8138000	making arguments that even a person with the most elementary understanding of human nature could retort.
8138000	8142000	Emily was well aware of this at the time, and was not using drugs while dating Anthony.
8142000	8147000	According to various social media accounts Emily ran between the ages of 13 and 20, Emily didn't do drugs,
8147000	8153000	and was in fact very against drug use. All of her posts from 2012 to before her video on My Husband and I
8153000	8158000	state that she became sober from heroin in 2012. However, in her video against My Husband and Myself,
8158000	8164000	Emily states that she only really got sober in 2015. If she was really using up until the year before making
8164000	8168000	all of these posts, joining YouTube, and writing this on, why would she not be honest and state that?
8168000	8173000	Why parade around an untrue sobriety date for the past five years, especially when nobody was asking?
8173000	8179000	It should go without saying that drug addicts often won't publicly admit that they're addicted, and may even deride
8179000	8184000	other users for self-medicating, perhaps in an attempt to make themselves feel better. It should go without saying
8184000	8190000	that sometimes sobriety may be a work in progress, and sobriety from one drug won't necessarily mean sobriety
8190000	8195000	from every drug, many will relapse and struggle with withdrawal. These are basic points that should have at least
8195000	8200000	been considered for the final draft, because they add nothing to the story at hand. But even on a standalone basis,
8200000	8203000	what Shannon says is cynical and cruel.
8203000	8208000	On the Sugarfruit channel, Emily ended up doing a couple of controversial things, like posting an anime review
8208000	8213000	naked in a bathtub. Emily states now in 2021 that she was high on heroin when she did this, but as established,
8213000	8214000	that cannot be true.
8214000	8219000	That was just one example, but there are so many others which just seem like unnecessary jibes at someone's past.
8219000	8225000	Unearthing all these accounts, whatever valid point that may be made is inundated with petty comments and
8225000	8230000	ill-tempered asides that reflect Shannon's own nature. Even points that may be valid were tainted with a
8230000	8235000	misinterpretation of comments that Emily was making. I often found myself returning to Emily's video to make sure
8235000	8239000	I hadn't missed anything. Like this for example, Shannon states that there would be no need to create a fake account
8239000	8244000	to find out Emily's location of employment, because Emily was already Facebook friends with Anthony.
8244000	8248000	Emily said she started getting Facebook friend requests from people she didn't know in 2014 when she started
8248000	8251000	working with Anthony professionally, and said it was all Anthony and me.
8263000	8268000	However, if you watch Emily's video, she clearly states that the intent of this fake account was to bait her to reveal
8268000	8273000	information that was clearly not already public, not even to people who had her added as friends.
8274000	8299000	So it would be ineffectual as to whether someone had her added prior. The only significant detail is the DM that Emily
8299000	8304000	artful posted herself, where she reveals to Anthony where she was working, but once again, because we don't have much of a
8304000	8309000	timeline, it's hard to tell if this was before or after the fake account was created. The creation of a fake account
8309000	8314000	clearly implies that whoever was committing this did not want to be found out. You could even say that Emily telling
8314000	8319000	Anthony could have deterred him from acting because it could then be linked back to him. Now that's just one theory,
8319000	8325000	and Shannon has a completely valid alternative one here, but her interpretation of Emily's argument leaves you wondering
8325000	8330000	if she didn't care enough to look at what Emily was exactly saying, or if she didn't expect the audience to, and that
8330000	8335000	was one of her stronger points. There are too many examples of this, I'm not going to go through them point by point,
8335000	8340000	plenty of other people have, but even if Shannon did want to destroy Emily's credibility, she still should have started
8340000	8346000	with rebuilding her own. And you know what, I get it, Shannon doesn't want forgiveness, fair enough, she wants to drop the
8346000	8351000	nuclear warhead and has little regard if she ends up in the blast radius. However, because one of the core arguments
8351000	8357000	made against her was that she breached a person's privacy and dignity, the Scorched Earth tactic ultimately backfires,
8357000	8362000	because it proves that exact point. There's so much here we didn't need to know. Even if it was shameful behaviour,
8362000	8369000	Emily already addressed this narrative in her original video. Speaking of Emily, she had a bit more to say as well.
8370000	8385000	On the night of February, Emily uploaded her rebuttal to Creepshow's response and counter allegations.
8385000	8392000	Now, unlike Shannon's video, there is a lot of content here, but it does form a pretty streamlined narrative that isn't too difficult to unpack.
8392000	8402000	The runtime was intimidating, and the tone was off-putting. To watch it was to jump into a pool of angry, chaotic information overload.
8402000	8409000	It focused on the wrong things, it put words in Emily's mouth, it did not explain the things that needed explaining,
8409000	8413000	and it only added fuel to the fire of confusion and disappointment.
8413000	8418000	Even before Emily's response video, many were already picking apart the flaws of Shannon's upload.
8418000	8423000	And with a high proportion still denouncing Shannon's behaviour, Emily was not obliged to make a response at all.
8423000	8428000	But she did, and it was another lengthy one, clocking in at approximately one and a half hours,
8428000	8432000	this time using physical and circumstantial evidence to not just refute Shannon's arguments,
8432000	8436000	but to prove that Shannon basically went mask off as the stalker in her own video,
8436000	8439000	and she didn't even have to advertise the evidence in the title.
8439000	8444000	And my Ranting and Raven 9gag account isn't attached to any of my other social media.
8444000	8452000	I very briefly used Ranting and Raven as my screen name on YouTube before I ever uploaded any content onto it,
8452000	8457000	so Shannon would have had to have knowledge of that username in order to search for it elsewhere.
8457000	8463000	This is not the first time that Shannon showed a username of mine where I had no idea where she found it.
8463000	8470000	In her document, she includes a list of my aliases, as she calls them, and one of them is EmmaDilemma.
8470000	8475000	And dilemma is spelled incorrectly, which is a DeviantArt page I vaguely remember making,
8475000	8481000	but has since been deleted or removed and cannot be found by searching for it on DeviantArt or on Google.
8481000	8489000	For Christ's sake, I even resorted to using Bing and DuckDuckGo, and I could not for the life of me find this DeviantArt account.
8489000	8495000	So that begs the question that if Shannon really only researched all this information after my video came out,
8495000	8497000	how did she get those usernames?
8497000	8501000	And it even begs the question, how did Anthony get those usernames?
8501000	8506000	Because when I search within our messages for either EmmaDilemma or Ranting and Raven, nothing comes up.
8506000	8513000	I just find it weird because having a list of every single alias and username I've ever went by online
8513000	8515000	is something that the BritaFilter account mentioned.
8515000	8519000	This includes observations regarding lost accounts that Shannon somehow knew the existence of,
8519000	8521000	private content that Shannon shared,
8521000	8527000	and these details own corroboration with the content used by some of these anonymous accounts that had harassed her.
8527000	8531000	Another action I find unusual is how in Shannon's unedited Google Doc,
8531000	8538000	she goes into great detail about a very small specific account that was re-uploading the audio of my old videos.
8538000	8541000	She talks about how she knew this account existed before,
8541000	8545000	and because she's such a good person, she tried reporting this account several times.
8545000	8552000	Oddly enough, this exact same account is actually linked in one of her suspected lolcow posts,
8552000	8556000	and this was the account that multiple sock puppets were trying to get me to notice.
8556000	8561000	This is almost as strange as the fact that every detail Shannon chose to fixate on in her video
8561000	8569000	is almost exactly all the same stuff that the BritaFilter account claimed that their 15-year-old brother was fixated on,
8569000	8573000	like the bathtub video, and accusing me of buying subscribers,
8573000	8576000	and that they were actually the ones that got me fired from the optical shop,
8576000	8582000	and let's not forget that BritaFilter even mentioned a video that I had only ever sent to Anthony,
8582000	8585000	and they have a list of pretty much every screen name I've ever had.
8585000	8587000	You know, the gang's all here, really.
8587000	8592000	Emily then continues to pick off the narrative surrounding Shannon's attempts to cast doubt on her substance issues,
8592000	8596000	and story regarding her violation at the hands of Shannon's husband, Anthony.
8596000	8599000	She presents counter-evidence and content that appears to contradict, and in some cases,
8599000	8604000	outright disprove the charges brought before her, leading to more questions about Shannon's intentions.
8604000	8607000	She claims that my real sobriety date was in November 2012,
8607000	8612000	and uses the lyrics from a song I wrote, sang, and posted in September 2016,
8612000	8616000	specifically about my relationship with and as confirmation of that date.
8616000	8622000	The lyrics are three years in November, and she says that's for the proof that my sobriety date was in November of 2012,
8623000	8628000	except November 2016 minus three would be November 2013.
8628000	8634000	She also did this using a clip from my I Dated A Sociopath video, which I uploaded in May of 2016.
8634000	8637000	This wasn't aided by the fact that an early draft of Shannon's video was leaked,
8637000	8640000	where she appears to disclose even more unnecessary information,
8640000	8644000	and goes off on further unhinged diatribes towards people she had felt betrayed her,
8644000	8646000	including former friends who spoke out about her,
8646000	8650000	and even an artist who she claims scammed her despite all evidence suggesting otherwise.
8650000	8652000	The tone in this script was even more self-superior,
8652000	8657000	even including a paragraph where she rejects an apology that hasn't even been made yet,
8657000	8661000	implying that Shannon almost had an expectation that this would truly flip the narrative on its head,
8661000	8664000	and expose everyone for the frauds they worked.
8664000	8668000	Alas, it didn't. I think it just showed that Shannon only really knew one thing,
8668000	8670000	and that was how to expose,
8670000	8674000	but sometimes in doing that you expose more about yourself than you do about others.
8674000	8678000	One key observation that seems to reveal Shannon's intention with the video comes right at the start,
8678000	8684000	where Shannon claimed that her video's publication would be the result of some in or out of court settlement,
8684000	8687000	which Emily disputes and seemingly debunks nearly immediately.
8687000	8689000	In the letter that was sent to me by her lawyer,
8689000	8691000	and don't worry, I'll get to the lawyer in a minute,
8691000	8692000	her lawyer states,
8692000	8696000	If you publicly comment on this letter or the matter discussed herein,
8696000	8702000	we will take that as a rejection of our offer to engage in settlement negotiations and will proceed to litigation.
8702000	8706000	And earlier in that clip, Shannon specifically said that if you, the audience,
8707000	8710000	were viewing the video, it means we either settled in or out of court,
8710000	8718000	most likely meaning I would have had to abide by her original request to remove all mention of Shanthony and stop speaking about everything.
8718000	8725000	So that leads me to believe Shannon wanted to get me to a place where I had to not only mysteriously delete all of my allegations,
8725000	8728000	but also to zip the lip about the situation entirely,
8728000	8731000	all while she eventually released that fail of a video,
8731000	8733000	and I would be allowed to do shit all about it.
8733000	8737000	On Shannon's bar, though, it shows a more calculated aspect to this plan,
8737000	8739000	an assumption that under the threat of legal repercussions,
8739000	8744000	Emily would roll over and open up an avenue for Creepshow to make her unchallenged return.
8744000	8747000	Emily didn't do that, so this route remained firmly shut,
8747000	8751000	while also allowing her to make this further response challenging Shannon's initial assertions.
8751000	8753000	Emily didn't squander this opportunity,
8753000	8758000	arguably making an even better and more concise video than the one that started all of this.
8758000	8762000	She even tried to set up a paper tiger argument in the unedited version of her Google doc,
8762000	8767000	where she says that if I try to say that her having all this information about me is stalking,
8767000	8768000	then I'm just playing the victim.
8768000	8773000	That she was just trying to clear her name and she did extensive research in order to do so.
8773000	8776000	Because look, this is all still publicly available.
8776000	8778000	Well, except for this, and except for this.
8778000	8780000	Well, okay, except for this.
8780000	8783000	But she had a deviantART when she was 13 that she posted hypersexual cringe.
8783000	8788000	There's a very minor point that in my opinion speaks a lot to the differences between the two creators.
8788000	8795000	Shannon brings up a video in passing where Emily discusses a relationship she seemingly had with a 13 year old when she was 17.
8795000	8801000	It's another rather tangential jab, but people may have moral issues with that behaviour, even when it's from that long ago.
8801000	8805000	Penny was a beautiful, charming, young girl.
8805000	8807000	We got along incredibly well.
8807000	8812000	She was exactly my type, both physically and mentally, or so I thought.
8812000	8821000	And the only possible, foreseeable downfall to our relationship at that time was that she was a little bit immature,
8821000	8825000	and she was a little bit immature because she was four years my junior.
8825000	8828000	In our response video though, Emily explains that she was actually the 13 year old,
8828000	8833000	and that the video in reference was a situation where she reversed the roles as a coping mechanism.
8833000	8837000	There appears to be evidence to back this up, and it seems like a consistent story with what we know.
8837000	8840000	But while clarifying that the situation was obviously inappropriate,
8840000	8846000	she states she has no ill feelings towards the other party involved as they clearly understand what they did was wrong,
8846000	8848000	and they have remained on good terms since.
8848000	8855000	This person was not, and is still not, a terrible person, and we still get along to this day.
8855000	8861000	I just really wanted to clarify that this person and I are much closer in age than originally portrayed in my video.
8861000	8868000	It was a running joke among our mutuals at the time because the age gap at first glance seemed a lot larger than it actually was.
8868000	8874000	This person obviously realizes that the relationship was inappropriate in nature,
8874000	8881000	and has since owned up to it. We've discussed it, and I don't hold any ill will against this person.
8881000	8887000	If anything, I still feel embarrassed about how that interaction went down.
8887000	8891000	I still really don't know how to feel about all of it.
8891000	8900000	I know this person is anonymous, but still something within me felt that needed clarifying because I do still care about this person.
8900000	8906000	It's a moment of humanity, and it demonstrates an ability to rise above the portrait that Shan was trying to paint,
8906000	8911000	though she wasn't going to conform to that image of the person who was only interested in victimizing themselves.
8911000	8918000	She showed sympathy, clemency, and humanity, and gave leeway to many, even those who may have harmed her in the past.
8918000	8923000	At one point, she even senses one of those people who had provided testimony against her as she believes they had been misled,
8923000	8931000	and wants to protect their privacy. It's not just compassionate, but it conveys a sense of peace with oneself, and their own experiences.
8931000	8936000	In many ways, Emily's video is a damning response, the evidence presented certainly doesn't help Shan's case,
8936000	8941000	but there's always going to be ambiguity on that front, especially when evidence or parts of it have been lost.
8941000	8944000	People are going to have to use their own judgement to fill in the blanks.
8944000	8949000	Emily's decision, however, to take the high road in presenting her story, and contrasting that with Shan's conduct,
8949000	8954000	was more conclusive than anything else, because ultimately it proved that Emily had moved on from her quote,
8954000	8959000	Checkered past, and Shannon hadn't. Shannon's plan seemed to be based on building a pattern of behaviour
8959000	8965000	to back up their allegations that Emily was an unreliable narrator, but the problem is that even if there was any pattern,
8965000	8969000	it stopped long before she decided to come forward with the present day claims.
8969000	8975000	If anything, Emily's video seemingly displayed Shan's response for what it was, a cast attempt to elicit revenge
8975000	8981000	against the person who they felt had played a role in their downfall. The truth is though, as Emily pointed out herself,
8981000	8986000	Shannon probably made a greater contribution to her own downfall than anyone else. Emily relayed her experience,
8986000	8992000	and the experience spoke for itself, and if you weren't entirely convinced of the time, Shannon's own response video
8992000	8997000	also seemed to speak for itself, a video that seemed so quintessentially Shannon when she least needed it.
8997000	9003000	However, with Shannon proclaiming it as her final video, perhaps it was the only way she could ever go out.
9003000	9006000	She did not go gentle into that good night.
9006000	9012000	But how did Shannon fool so many people for so long, friends included? Well, let's talk about it.
9017000	9022000	A day before Emily Artful's bombshell upload, our friend Hopeless Peaches also posted a video detailing
9022000	9027000	Shannon's tone when she approached Creepshow in private, with some striking similarities to say the least.
9027000	9032000	Okay, and now this bit was just another part that really began to panic me.
9032000	9039000	If I'm completely honest, reading it still kinda makes me feel anxious. It felt like a threat.
9039000	9044000	I think I would go so far as to say, without a doubt, it is one.
9044000	9051000	This all started because I simply asked, out of concern, to just take out one accusation from her video,
9051000	9061000	and I was being threatened with more, not only if I, but if anyone else made a video in my favour or shared proof of her lying about me.
9061000	9065000	Not too long after, a former friend of Shannon's, and even someone purporting to be the sibling that Shannon doxed,
9065000	9069000	came forward corroborating Emily's testimony with their own experiences.
9069000	9077000	The most confusing and almost laughable part of this is that a couple days before all of this information came out,
9077000	9080000	Shannon had sent me roses to my own house.
9083000	9088000	You know, so like, I think that was also part of it. It sounds stupid, but it's like, how do you reconcile,
9088000	9093000	oh yeah, someone sent me roses, but they also don't think much of me and are shit-talking me on a website.
9093000	9102000	It is so contradictory that you almost feel a little bit crazy, because you're like, okay, what happened in between?
9102000	9105000	They weren't the only people to testify on this behaviour.
9105000	9108000	In fact, in the weeks following, there were plenty more people who wanted to weigh in.
9108000	9112000	However, broadly speaking, the reaction across social media as a whole was one of shock,
9112000	9116000	and that's a testament to the facade that she had successfully crafted.
9116000	9121000	With that in mind though, none of her previous antics seemed particularly incongruent with the revelations
9121000	9126000	uncovered by the various corners of the internet, it just exposed the sheer lengths she would go to create them.
9126000	9129000	The word breadcrumbs is used a lot, and it's not hard to see why.
9129000	9134000	The stories that she supposedly manufactured would often span years, and would regularly crop up ages after they had first been told.
9134000	9137000	Often as a means to defend herself from criticism.
9137000	9142000	In many ways, it made her online persona almost impenetrable, because whenever people would raise the issues with her content,
9142000	9146000	she would default to that backstory that she had so vividly depicted in older videos.
9146000	9151000	In many ways, those storytimes spawned the foundation for that sympathetic portrayal that many assume when watching her content.
9151000	9155000	The fact is that because of YouTube, I was able to make a life for myself.
9155000	9159000	A life where I am no longer sleeping in public with my car,
9159000	9166000	I am no longer worried about getting kicked out of parking lots by cops and men following me to my car and jacking off on the window,
9166000	9170000	which yes, did happen, and yes, still stresses me the fuck out.
9170000	9176000	Through countless situations, observers interpreted Shannon's shortcomings as carelessness or emotionality,
9176000	9182000	and although they were viable explanations at the time, were they really believable with the context to so many of her other actions?
9183000	9193000	Out of everything I've done my entire life, deciding to move into a car with my boyfriend was actually a choice that I in no way regret.
9193000	9199000	Simply put, no. She constructed so much of her in-video personality from these lies that she had espoused.
9199000	9205000	Everything that had been demonstrated in the space of two weeks unravelled that persona because it was so antithetical to what she represented,
9205000	9207000	yet it all made sense.
9208000	9215000	A person so sensitive to others, so socially conscious, using slurs more than comfortably, attacking friends who thought she would fight to the death for them,
9215000	9220000	someone who had channelled intensity and passion in videos when discussing subjects that they proclaimed were meaningful to them,
9220000	9225000	applying many tactics to harm those that they had distaste for while decrying those same actions publicly.
9225000	9231000	It all pointed to one thing, that Shannon had something she valued more than those around her and the principles that they possessed,
9231000	9233000	and in my opinion, that was drama.
9233000	9238000	Here are the two facts that I think most can agree on, emotions heighten drama, and misinformation heightens drama.
9238000	9242000	However, most of us don't seek to be emotional, nor do we seek to mislead our audience.
9242000	9249000	Nonetheless, Creepshow Arts content was primed for that sort of toxic combination, and absolving itself under the guise of humanity or style.
9249000	9254000	Nevertheless, it would still provoke people, and when the drama was at a lull, she'd find ways to generate it,
9254000	9260000	whether this was her behaviour on the lolcow forums, or just spontaneously deciding to take aim at someone who she felt had wronged her like hopeless peaches.
9260000	9267000	In many ways, the tabloid exaggerations that Creepshow Art fell foul to never seemed like a cut and dry case of overinvestment in content,
9267000	9273000	but more just the desire to fulfil a daily quota of drama while trying to maintain the masquerade that she wasn't the person who instigated it.
9273000	9278000	She wanted to be at the centre of drama without bearing the responsibility that it occurred in the first place,
9278000	9287000	her language would regularly tread the line between being incendiary and observational, riling people up but falling back onto the observational defence when people protested her presentation.
9287000	9293000	Even in the Emily Artful situation, one that illustrates a much more disturbing pattern, whatever motive was behind her involvement,
9293000	9300000	the behaviour that was credited to her was accented by a provocation of a person with the intent to spurn a response or a reaction.
9300000	9306000	In many instances, she would use that reaction to fuel more videos where she would employ that advantage to put other creators down further.
9306000	9314000	Even when she regularly misrepresented those she was criticising, that infallible platform that she established regularly led her to emerging from dramas largely unscathed.
9314000	9320000	In the case of our sketchbook friend, it felt like Shannon was hoping that Emily would jump the gun, make allegations from an emotional place,
9320000	9325000	and Shannon would capitalise on it with the rational put down, and the backlog of evidence established through the breadcrumbs.
9325000	9331000	Fortunately, Emily confronted Shannon in private and managed to end the harassment in a way that put the ball in Shannon's court about going public,
9331000	9337000	which she still managed to do, but just not in the way that one would have expected, but in a no less calculated fashion.
9337000	9347000	She told me how over the years, really fucking with me and sending me those rage-filled emails became a way for her to cope with the stress of her life.
9347000	9359000	After we had blown up the way we did, she went through an insanely hard time in high school, and it was a way for her to get her anger out, her messing with me.
9359000	9366000	So all that anger, all that rage was not just at me, but the people around her who were hurting her.
9366000	9375000	She then went on to get married after high school, have a kid right away, and was an army wife, and anytime she was stressed or upset,
9375000	9382000	she would turn to me, and she would turn to fucking with me.
9382000	9389000	In many ways, the original video where she talks about her stalker Amy is on the surface a classic fake story designed to elicit sympathy from viewers.
9389000	9395000	However, beneath it there were a couple more details that seemed to take advantage of the situation it was based on, all dependent on Emily's own feelings.
9395000	9401000	First, as a way to try and cement its truth so those appeals in the months prior to Mrs. Artful would seem more justified,
9401000	9408000	second, to hopefully gag Emily in a way that speaking out would incriminate her, but third, to also promote this idea of forgiveness and moving on.
9408000	9415000	Having realised that I had done something to her, something that made her feel justified in doing this to me,
9415000	9426000	made me realise as fucked up as what she did was, I was probably not as innocent as I thought I was in this.
9426000	9438000	I'm not trying to imply that I deserved this shit, or that anyone deserves this shit to be done with them, but like, my actions led to that reaction that I got, you know?
9438000	9447000	In a way, if Emily did watch this video and felt emotionally susceptible to the parallels of this Amy mystery, she might also hear about how Shannon resolved it and moved on,
9447000	9453000	and felt inclined to do the same, but she couldn't, as long as Shannon hadn't moved on from those antics herself.
9453000	9456000	But with that in mind, let's do just that.
9468000	9479000	When I went into recovery for the final time, I did the work, I worked hard, and I had to take a long, hard look at myself in the mirror, and it wasn't pretty.
9479000	9484000	It was ugly and it was broken, but I had to do it in order to change.
9484000	9493000	Shannon, you need help, and this is me and everyone else asking you to go get help, not just for yourself, but for the people that you have hurt.
9493000	9498000	You need to take that long hard look in the mirror like I did, and see the ugly broken pieces.
9498000	9506000	There's no magic glue to put every single piece back together perfectly, but once it's all put back together, there is a clear reflection.
9506000	9512000	There's a lot of Emily's story that resonates with me, fortunately not the bit where she was stalked for how many years.
9512000	9518000	However, coming from a bad place, and having YouTube take you to a better place, at least is something personal for a lot of people, myself included.
9519000	9525000	Those who appreciate what YouTube has given to them, the responsibility, the care, the public interest, they don't take that for granted.
9525000	9530000	As Emily said herself, they look into the mirror, they see what's wrong with themselves, and they work on it.
9530000	9537000	Shannon simply didn't, she just adapted her toxic behaviour to an evolving environment which enabled her to guard the upper hand in certain social situations.
9537000	9540000	It's two sides of a very divided coin.
9540000	9546000	In a way, Shannon preyed on one of the most flawed aspects of online culture, our nature to analyse tone rather than content.
9546000	9553000	I've spoken at length on what constitutes a good response or a bad one, but the truth is that a bad response isn't always indicative of a person's character.
9553000	9558000	Drama often occurs under stressful circumstances where one's reputation may feel completely at stake,
9558000	9564000	and although I'm always of the belief that audiences deserve clarity and honesty from their creators and it's hard to trust them if they can't provide that,
9564000	9568000	I also accept that sometimes people crumble, and can't offer what viewers deserve to hear.
9568000	9575000	Shannon seemed acutely aware of this, and accordingly deftly balanced emotion and content to the point where many would make excuses for her shortcomings,
9575000	9579000	even if they regularly prolonged unnecessary conflict between multiple parties.
9579000	9586000	As long as the other person was clearly more unstable or more justified, it was fine to jump in on them with faceless accusations or slanted framing.
9586000	9593000	This was not just a method that was effective on her own channel, but off her channel, with platforms like Twitter used for exchanges that would occasionally inspire subsequent content,
9593000	9599000	but eventually she came face to face with someone whose actions could not be traversed, herself.
9599000	9605000	Shannon had a way of provoking people that made them look unreasonable, when in reality she had merely given herself a strategic advantage,
9605000	9610000	and otherwise held very little moral high ground. When she couldn't do it in her own name without incriminating herself,
9610000	9616000	she did it anonymously, using sock puppet accounts to shovel hatred against her enemies, her friends, and even her family.
9616000	9622000	Whether that was on Twitter or on lolkau farm, who knows how far it truly went, it would be hard to take her word at face value.
9622000	9631000	If you like my older videos, thank you, I mean it, thank you. It means the world to me that the art I made in that time frame means a lot to you,
9631000	9638000	because it means a lot to me. However, I do not, and do not want to go back to the person I was when I made those videos.
9638000	9645000	When these criticisms did validate her response, although Shannon conceded on certain demerits, she'd also defiantly stand by her body of work,
9645000	9651000	using her success story as a proud defence for her content, warts and all, talking about how she'd come from the homeless girl recording out of her car,
9651000	9658000	and a lot of people were won over by that, appreciating that even if she was imperfect, they were receiving a raw version of someone who was doing their best.
9658000	9664000	The problem was, it was just another part of the act, a way to make her story seem more genuine, noble, and earnest,
9664000	9671000	when it was in fact more fraudulent than anything else before. It was never raw, it was well prepared, seasoned, served on one of those pretentious square plates.
9671000	9676000	However, when you go to such lengths to maintain an image, its eventual collapse will only be more catastrophic.
9676000	9683000	While most at arm's length brought the illusion presented on the Creepshow art channel, the overreaching nature of the modern internet can be incriminating,
9683000	9689000	and much of the evidence that follows seemed hard to dispute. From IPs to old screenshots, they may have been imperfect on their own,
9689000	9693000	but together they paged a picture very clear for viewers who had the ability to use logic.
9693000	9700000	In many ways, the fatal mistake that Creepshow made was surrounding herself with principled people and viewers who weren't afraid to speak out about her malicious behaviour,
9700000	9703000	and when people began to speak out, they didn't really stop.
9704000	9713000	Shannon told me how she had plans to harass Emily, either by sending her letters or prank calling her home,
9713000	9720000	how she planned to leave hate messages on her videos, or DM her from burner accounts to spread hate.
9720000	9729000	This is when I began to distance myself from Shannon, and if this is true, these are all things that Emily Artful has accused her of.
9729000	9738000	So if this story is true, it definitely coincides with the allegations that are being made by Emily Artful, and it seems to lend some credibility to them.
9738000	9744000	Throughout much of the last few parts, I have attributed many actions to Shannon. With that in mind, particularly with regards to Emily's situation,
9744000	9750000	there is also a lot of behaviour that could be connected to Shannon's husband, Anthony, especially with mine to the more serious allegations.
9750000	9757000	I don't want to downplay this, or solely place the responsibility on one person. Someone silent shouldn't absolve them from accountability.
9757000	9763000	However, in using her platform, Shannon grouped these claims in with many of those made against her, appointing herself main respondent,
9763000	9769000	putting her own credibility on the line for the person she wanted to stand by, concocting the narrative that if Emily was an unreliable narrator,
9769000	9772000	then none of the allegations could bear that weight.
9772000	9778000	Unfortunately, that failed, and therefore many of these points against her and her husband appeared to hold up,
9778000	9784000	and her lashing out at former friends for criticising her or Anthony's actions seemed even less justified, particularly with how she went about it.
9784000	9789000	Listen, I can't sit here and tell you that everything discussed in today's video is true beyond a shadow of a doubt,
9789000	9794000	but there's a reason for why it is so widely believed, and why many people, even former friends of Shannon, find it highly plausible.
9794000	9801000	For Shannon to be angry at people for believing that, and using their platform to criticise her like they would anyone is unrealistic and unreasonable.
9801000	9806000	If anything, her comments just substantiate this sort of Disney villain-esque arc that she seemed to be undergoing,
9806000	9810000	once again trying to hold past commitments over people's heads after circumstances have changed.
9810000	9815000	The difference is Shannon, the commitment that people make to stand by you is dependent on how you treat them as well.
9815000	9820000	When you craft your personal network the way you craft your drama, you can hardly be surprised they turn on you.
9820000	9826000	Most people do not want to denounce a friend, and she certainly didn't make it easy for anyone, I'll give her that much.
9826000	9830000	Although it may not always seem that way, a lot of creators do just want to be left alone to get on with their work.
9830000	9835000	They don't want to start drama, they want to express themselves on their channel and enjoy their real lives.
9835000	9841000	Unless you've built a career on seeking out drama, most audiences don't enjoy a person who is just constantly engaging in controversy.
9841000	9846000	As public figures, you have to accept that there will always be people talking about you, and you can't respond to every individual.
9846000	9854000	However, you are still deserving of personal security, privacy, and decency, those are principles held by a large majority of creators and viewers alike.
9854000	9860000	Whether it was on Lowell Cal Farms or not, Shannon's behaviour showed a blatant disregard towards those principles that she had advocated for,
9860000	9866000	and to many of her viewers, that was a cardinal sin. To them, that became the real Shannon, and the subscriber count spoke for itself.
9866000	9871000	The person they knew before, the story she told, the beliefs she instilled in them, it lost so much of its worth.
9871000	9877000	With that in mind, how could you trust her commentary on sensitive subjects that banked on those exact fundamentals that she deserted?
9877000	9882000	You knew that wasn't okay when you said it. You cannot pretend and rewrite history to be the victim here.
9882000	9888000	You can't pretend you didn't do what you did. That is garbage, and you should be ashamed of yourself for trying to lump
9888000	9892000	the deliberate considered actions you took over an extended period of time.
9892000	9898000	The simple truth is, you can't. If this has been an outburst to all news, then sure, maybe she could have changed,
9898000	9903000	but it spanned long into her YouTube career, up until she was called out for it, and if you only stopped something when you called out for it,
9903000	9907000	then you'll always struggle to prove to people that you've stopped for the better of reasons.
9907000	9911000	If it had been a strictly minor personal dispute, then maybe there'd be a reason to keep it private,
9911000	9916000	but it clearly overlapped onto her public platform and how she used it, which made it even harder to defend,
9916000	9921000	with behaviour that many interpreted as borderline criminal. Unfortunately, with all these circumstances considered,
9921000	9924000	it may just be too late for Shannon in the online world.
9924000	9930000	I will seldom argue that a person whose channel has changed them for the better should reconsider their status on the basis of their past,
9930000	9937000	and I'm sure Shannon's success did a lot for her, but the root of that toxic behaviour persisted, on her channel and off it.
9937000	9943000	In that case, there are changes that we can make, we can learn, evolve, do better. I 100% believe that.
9943000	9947000	It's just sometimes we have to do it in a different place to where we were before.
9947000	9957000	So, it's so gross. Thomas, you are a public figure who makes very public accusations and statements about everyone else being fraudulent and vile,
9957000	9965000	so you cannot just excuse yourself from the table when that setting that you're benefiting from comes back to you.
9965000	9972000	You don't have to return to the places of hardship to be a better person, but you do need to know what took you there and what can take you out.
9972000	9975000	Otherwise, you'll just continue to be drawn back into that toxic cycle.
9975000	9979000	Creepshow art wasn't just a part of that cycle, but often perpetuated it,
9979000	9984000	inadvertently tying it to her brand and the personal story which so many thought resonated with them,
9984000	9987000	the emergence from a bad place by doing good things.
9987000	9992000	When the truth was revealed, she was pulled down with the falsehoods she had crafted and those she had led on with it.
9992000	9995000	If that was the real Creepshow art, then people would rather forget her.
9995000	9999000	The illusion of reality is one often crafted by online personas.
9999000	10003000	It makes sense in a way, but when you tie that to your whole personality and beliefs,
10003000	10007000	then you need to have some conviction and commitment to what you advocate for.
10007000	10010000	Creepshow didn't, and ultimately paid the price for it.
10010000	10015000	I hope she never goes back to where she was, but she can't stay where she is either.
10015000	10019000	For now, I'll leave the rest of the judgement to you. Let's move on.
10021000	10023000	And there we go, that was the video.
10023000	10027000	I know this one's been in the works a long time, we've had a fair few delays,
10027000	10033000	but we have prevailed and we have completed it, and I am grateful that we have got there.
10033000	10038000	I'd like to first and foremost thank all the editors, their links will be in the pinned comment,
10038000	10042000	go and check out their fantastic work, they're all really talented people.
10042000	10047000	I'd like to thank my patrons, $10 patrons on the screen right now,
10047000	10059000	and I'd also like to give a thanks to my $50 patrons who are Bellarex, Colin Ryan, Hypercube, Esther Bedoya, and Goldman.
10059000	10062000	Thank you so much for your support, it really means a lot.
10062000	10069000	I would like to thank the artists who create the stills, obviously their credits will be in the pinned comment as well.
10069000	10073000	I'd like to thank Surfshark for sponsoring the video, as always, pleasure to work with you guys,
10073000	10076000	and Code Opinion will get you a nice discount on their service.
10076000	10081000	Thank you again for sponsoring, and a little brief announcement if you're still listening,
10081000	10084000	that I have been working on some merchandise.
10084000	10090000	It's a work in progress still, and you can order it now, and if you input Code Opinion,
10090000	10094000	then you'll get a discount for being the first to try some of the merch.
10094000	10099000	I don't really have too much else to add, thank you all for watching, and I hope you guys are doing well.
10099000	10103000	Anyway, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
10106000	10126000	Thanks for watching!
