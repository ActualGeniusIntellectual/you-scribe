0	10120	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,
10120	15400	and I expect this to be one of the harder videos that I've made, not just because of the sheer controversy that this has caused,
15400	22040	but because of how personal it is to me. In almost every video I've done, I always try to work off a certainty,
22040	27600	an idea that this is what's happening, and honestly, today I've been taken out of my comfort zone.
27640	33040	This is an exceptionally sensitive topic, with many people who probably won't find this enjoyable, and I don't blame them,
33040	38040	but I wouldn't feel right if I didn't get this off my chest, because honestly, out of all the situations that have transpired,
38040	42640	this one gives me a lot to say, but with no real grip on quite how to say it.
42640	49040	YouTube is a monumental platform, with a lot of users, a lot of power, and thus a lot of danger.
49040	56440	There are currently 1.3 billion users on the site, an alleged 300 hours worth of content being uploaded every single minute,
56480	62360	and if you go from video to video, then it will take you down multiple different rabbit holes, and multiple different directions.
62360	68160	It's kind of weird to think about how much content is out there, and how many things we probably miss.
68160	73760	Today, however, we'll be breaking down one of the darker holes, and I'm sorry to anyone that may not sit well with.
73760	78160	I've felt a whirlwind of sentiments during this, and initially expressed it in a Twitter thread,
78160	83960	that I now feel is obsolete due to this video, so I shan't be referring to it, because I've refined my thoughts a bit,
84000	89200	but the background that I stated in the tweet is true, it was probably a bit more than one and a half years ago,
89200	96840	I don't know when to be exact, but I was just a small YouTuber at the time, I was doing some research with Kavos back when he was still on around 20,000 subs,
96840	100360	and someone messaged me, talking to me about the situation they'd found.
100360	103480	It was called My Morning, or Mo Itpo.
103480	109320	Basically, what people were doing was that they were assembling these playlists, with these girls doing their morning routine,
109360	115360	and these creeps were time-stamping in the comments, basically being absolute cretins to these unsuspecting children.
115360	121680	It was disgusting, and I thought, well, I could pass on to Kavos, and so that's what I did, so we did more research,
121680	127640	and honestly, it's one of the most stomach-churning things that I've ever investigated, and I felt nauseous for days.
127640	134200	However, the video came out, garnered around 25-30,000 views at the time, and within a few days, the playlists were gone,
134200	138120	videos were deleted, and if not, the comment sections were deactivated.
138120	143320	Now, I knew it was far from over, this was not the first time YouTube had been caught up in this very specific issue,
143320	149560	and I'll definitely discuss this more later, but this new one is another pedogate, whatever you wanna call it,
149560	154280	and at this point, there are more gates than a fucking airport, let's just hope this one isn't terminal.
154280	160360	The problem is, as it typically is with pedophiles and predators on the platform, is that they are persistent bastards.
160360	165640	Pedophiles make me, like a majority of people, incredibly uncomfortable, and when we encounter them,
165640	171240	expressing their sick desires, and soliciting pleasure from minors, we feel repulsed, and we want to deal with them,
171240	175880	likely in more ways than one, and therefore, it's an issue that many of us feel strongly about.
175880	181000	Enter stage left, Matt Watson, aka Matt's What It Is, a disillusioned YouTuber,
181000	186360	who decided to make a damning video documenting the platform for child exploitation on YouTube.
186360	191960	He wasn't the first, and he won't be the last, but he was definitely the most orchestrated, and the most impassioned.
191960	197640	The theme of the video is that child exploitation is running rampant on the platform, and it's only devolving further,
197640	202360	with various underage suggestive content being exploited by the cretins online,
202360	206520	including many of these same techniques that Cavos and I witnessed a couple years back.
206520	212680	One of the key differences, though, was that in spite of the fact that these weren't necessarily being assembled in playlists,
212680	221000	YouTube's own algorithm seemed to be creating these circles for people where they could have access to an endless stream of similarly perverted content.
221000	225560	He also observed that some of these videos were running adverts on them, monetising the problem.
225560	232200	Matt made the proclamation that it had to be dealt with, establishing the line of reasoning that YouTube have not been listening to this persisting problem,
232200	239880	particularly due to their alleged ignorance, and the only way to make them learn would be to go straight for the jugular, their income, and thus their advertisers.
239880	246680	So, Matt went on a passionate campaign about gaining advertiser attention to hold YouTube's feet to the fire, to force them to address this.
246760	254920	His original video on YouTube is a dramatic rant, with high-level editing, and with perseverance, he muscled his way onto the front page of Reddit,
254920	263000	and subsequently attracted attention from all arenas, not taking long to reach the ravenous media who were waiting to report on YouTube's latest oopsie.
263000	264040	OOPSIE!
264040	269480	Other news-oriented YouTubers decided to report on it as well, providing their thoughts on the situation.
269480	276360	However, with such instantaneous momentum, Matt decided to do multiple livestreams to consolidate his viewpoints and positions,
276360	280920	but many people began to become suspicious about his credibility and his integrity,
280920	287000	and so certain creators took to Twitter, took to the stream, and even took to their channels to take him and some of his narratives on.
287000	292200	Much of the criticism focused on the belief that the advertisers were the central crux to resolving the issue,
292200	296360	and for any motive for YouTube to respond, the advertisers had to withdraw.
296360	303720	Many creators felt that he was overly invested in proving this narrative, and in the end, creators would suffer from very little difference in outcome.
303720	309080	Matt disagreed, while also stating he believed that the creators were highly invested in their own pockets,
309080	313240	and were prioritising themselves over the welfare of the children in his videos.
313240	319720	On top of this, many claimed him to have a rather questionable past with YouTube, bringing to contention the real motives of his video.
319720	325160	This has led to a load of back and forth, caused confusion, division, and frustration in the community,
325160	331080	who can all pretty much agree that pedophilia is bad, but can create no consensus on what to actually do.
331080	335720	I'm going to try and work out what we can do, while I also have a load of criticism to hand out,
335720	339880	because I am a bit annoyed for various reasons, and we'll explore each one of them now.
339880	344520	I guess we should start at our home base, because there's no place quite like home.
344520	361000	I have a pretty volatile relationship with YouTube, I've never made that a secret,
361000	364440	and although I've been very grateful that I have the platform in many ways,
364440	370360	there are many legitimate criticisms regarding how they have behaved towards larger and medium sized creators of recent,
370360	373240	behaviour which has constantly confused me.
373240	378440	In one way, I do see YouTube's point of view, they want to project the right image to the advertisers,
378440	384200	they want the right people to remain monetised, and they know who the representatives of the platform are,
384200	388360	but I feel they've really miscalculated what gets people up in arms at this point,
388360	391480	and this may be due to the problem of retrospect.
391480	397240	A couple years ago we had the PewDiePie situation, everyone remembers, I shouldn't really need to recap it,
397240	402440	but in case, you basically ended up in the headlines for making some rather anti-semitic jokes.
402440	408680	And YouTube has always been an edgy platform, and I think that was a moment of re-evaluation for a lot of creators
408680	414600	on what sort of message they're representing, because otherwise, that video at the time didn't receive much backlash
414600	416680	until the mainstream media picked up on it.
416680	423240	Generally, however, I think one of the things that YouTube misses with this is that advertisers aren't really that interested in those things,
423240	429240	because typically these controversies might be confined to one creator, who YouTube can sanction pretty effectively,
429240	434200	and what they're more concerned about is when it affects the trend, that's when it's hard to contain.
434200	437800	And that's one of the first things that initiated this original adpocalypse,
437800	444920	it wasn't actually PewDiePie's edgy jokes that got the adverts off, it was the numerous further headlines reported to the Times and so on
444920	448200	that demonstrated ads running next to actual ISIS videos.
448200	454520	Now, I may be wrong, but I don't think it's a controversial statement to make to say that ISIS is worse than PewDiePie.
454520	460520	Another really great example is the Logan Paul situation, advertisers could have very easily pulled out for that,
460520	466920	however, he's a public figure, he's an adult, he took the brunt of the responsibility, everyone knew where it lay.
466920	473560	What really made the adpocalypse an issue is that it transcended one popular YouTuber, and covered the realms of many channels,
473560	480760	some of which were not easy to find, that were not just a waste of advertising space, but also a terrible thing for a brand to be associated with.
480760	486520	So they pulled ads for a significant amount of time, and eventually, with a bit of hesitation, they came back.
486520	495160	Now, of course, there's also other motivations for pulling ads, such as the drive for lower ad rates, and normally the capitalisation on controversy like that.
495160	501640	But regardless of the motives of the advertisers, YouTube since then has responded by implementing multiple new algorithms,
501720	505160	and trying to clean up the image they want to portray to the media.
505160	512680	This was particularly demonstrated through their poorly received YouTube rewind, which found them misrepresenting the year in the most over-saccharine way possible,
512680	518680	which is utterly hilarious when you think about it, because in spite of all this, it barely influenced advertisers' stance.
518680	525080	On top of this, they have subsequently cracked down on channels that may be deemed offensive or inappropriate, such as Mumkey Jones,
525080	533720	a YouTube comic who made videos containing rather edgy humour, with which YouTube gave him three community strikes in a rather orchestrated attempt to remove him from the platform.
533720	542680	They have further cracked down on demonetisations and strikes, in fact, I personally had an experience with YouTube's rather stringent system for anyone who was around at the time.
542680	549960	I uploaded my video documenting the DaddyOFive situation, and how he has managed to create his own platform with a few die-hard fans.
549960	559160	It was a video that took a lot of work and effort, and when it went up, it obtained around 60,000 views in the first couple hours before YouTube removed it and gave me a community strike.
559160	566040	It caused me a lot of stress, as before this, I had two other similar problems with YouTube and my videos, and it felt like they were out to get me.
566040	572600	They age restricted my pineapple on pizza video, and then removed my video, criticising them for their handling of the Logan Paul situation.
572600	580280	It was pretty stressful, I'll say that much. I felt like at the turn of 2019, many creators were fearful for their future on the platform.
580280	589160	There have been multiple instances of YouTubers having their channels spontaneously deleted, demonetised, and attacked, and that's not a really significant point on its own.
589160	597400	But what I'm trying to say is that YouTube were pulling out all the stops, punishing all these channels who'd never had any real run-ins with the advertisers anyway.
597400	604520	Why did they suddenly lose the advertisers again, invalidating all their previous efforts? Well, because of the narrative.
604520	610760	Advertisers aren't really concerned with what they know, they're more afraid of what they don't know. What do I mean?
610760	616600	After all, it's after finding out their ads were running on these videos that they pulled out, and yes, that is true.
616600	625400	When you break down the narrative, the greatest problem is you don't know the extent of this, you don't know how many videos in this wormhole are going to be running ads on,
625400	632600	and so all the positioning from YouTube, flaunting their advertiser-friendly credentials, were perceptibly torn down in no time at all,
632600	638440	because you can't continuously control the smaller creators with which there are genuinely an abundance of.
638440	644440	With all that out of the way, what it does indicate is that YouTube have been aware of the problems with their platform,
644440	648280	and have been trying to implement the algorithms that will detect this content.
648280	657000	However, this has often left many creators in the crossfire because YouTubers are more likely to use tags, titles, and descriptions that are identifiable by algorithms.
657000	663880	Children, the subject of today's video, do not think about those things anywhere near as much, most of them are just doing this shit for fun.
663880	672680	Like a majority of uploaders, there's no algorithmic way to fully detect them, and of course, there are hundreds of thousands of hours of content uploaded on YouTube every day.
672680	676280	I can't expect them to manually comb through every single video.
676360	684280	What can be done? Well, in Matt Watson's video, it was shown what would technically be classed as a rabbit hole, even though he called it a wormhole,
684280	693080	I assume they're meant to be the same things, that basically once entered created an algorithmic cycle which makes content highly accessible to those with unsavoury desires,
693080	700440	so my first piece of advice is to break that up. Now, judging from the follow-up streams and various coverage, they have been working to do that,
700600	708440	so fair play on that behalf, hopefully they'll keep it up. Equally, although some of the videos were fairly low on views and thus not necessarily particularly noticeable,
708440	715320	and not certain to have been reported, there were videos with significant amounts of views, and I would argue that if YouTube set a threshold for views,
715320	722200	something manageable, because at the end of the day, some of these videos do have over a million views, and they should work on that.
722280	731000	I don't know the specifics that I can suggest, but by the looks of it, a lot of the worst offenders are on Russian YouTube, and they should maybe branch out their linguistics departments.
731000	735640	You wanna know how many employees work for YouTube? A few thousand maximum. That is pretty low.
735640	745000	Now, of course, they likely work with contractors around the world in content monitoring, but that's still a low number given how many people they are delivering a service to.
745000	751080	And alright, maybe hire some more employees, but the thing is that Google doesn't disclose their income obtained from YouTube,
751080	762520	so I can't really comment specifically on such things, because although YouTube is in many ways profitable, they also fork out huge expenditure on content royalty costs, bandwidth costs, storage, processing, and so on.
762520	769320	YouTube is not a cheap business, but I don't know how much they make, and I don't know how much control they have over their budgets.
769320	773480	Whatever Google are doing, I don't know anything, and that leads me to this point.
773480	780680	I wish YouTube would be more open, because I want to see their point of view. They seem to be making some sort of effort in dealing with this stuff.
780680	791160	I've seen this, but it's hard to empathise and provide ideas when they're so closed off, and from what I've heard, the employees themselves can't open up because it's protocol, and so what do they do?
791160	797400	I mean, that's what it is, also focused a lot of running this narrative that some of the adverts were being shown on these channels.
797400	803880	Now, I highly doubt that children will monetise their channels, because you have to fill out a form with various details, including social security,
803880	810680	so unless their parents filled in those forms, which would make them fairly terrible parents, and shifting at least partial responsibility onto them,
810680	814600	it means that the videos are likely being monetised for copyrighted content.
814600	823480	Now, chances are that this content was never flagged for review, likely because it had some innocent title, and thus was immediately copyrighted and monetised, and YouTube never checked it.
824440	831480	And there are no real algorithms to pick this up, unless YouTube manually reviews every uploaded video, which we've established can't really happen.
831480	839880	My suggestion would be to actually see what terms you can change, and see if you can avoid copyright monetisation of channels who have not filled financial details,
839880	848040	but that might be an infringement of copyrighted property, so then you could say, well maybe remove videos that use copyrighted property that are not monetised,
848040	852760	but then you might hit smaller creators with unfair claims, and they can't publish their videos.
852760	861320	There is no easy solution, YouTube has to work out channels to terminate, comment sections to centre, and monetisation is a secondary issue in these instances,
861320	865240	because it's inherently linked to whether YouTube encountered the video in the first place.
865240	872040	Copyright claims are an inherently profitable business, and those businesses eat that shit up, regardless of the views or the morality involved,
872040	879480	but at the same time, a lot of the videos reported on weren't inherently sexual, but were being sexualised by the people in the comment sections.
879480	881880	And as another creator eloquently puts,
881880	888360	If there is a 13 year old uploading content that is being sexualised, does that video deserve to be taken down?
888360	896120	In that situation, I might understand a comment section disabled, should she be faulted and have her video terminated because of these scumbags?
896120	899720	I don't necessarily agree with that, to what extent will we go?
899720	907880	There is no algorithm that can distinguish that nuance, now in this instance, YouTube have responded, letting people know what they're doing, and it does seem proactive.
907960	912360	Although I feel like this would have been avoidable if they'd been more open in the first place.
912360	918360	I want to empathise with YouTube's situation, because given my experience with them, they are receptive to these issues,
918360	923000	but at the same time, because they are seldom clear about what they're doing, it has led to this.
923000	928360	When you don't fill in the gaps for people, people fill in the gaps themselves, often to fill their own worldview,
928360	934840	and given people's distaste for the platform, it was inevitable that many were going to see this as confirmation for their worst fears,
934840	942040	and I'll definitely discuss that later, but for now, we have to look at the main man who has been promoting this, and discuss his methodology.
950520	959480	As discussed in my previous part, Matt Watson's video brings to light an important topic, and as said, no one wants this on their platform, and I will provide credit for that.
959480	964840	However, at the same time, I was never properly won over by the video, mainly for a few details that irked me.
964840	971080	A lot of the video was about tone rather than points, about riling up outrage rather than actually discussing the problem.
971080	979160	I'll break down the video for you as simple as possible. Right now, YouTube's algorithm of suggested content creates a cycle that feeds people's sick desires.
979160	983960	There are comments on these videos that basically allow pedos to communicate and connect with each other.
983960	993000	These videos in question involve children, some of whom prepubescent, conducting activities that may expose themselves to positions prone to being sexualized.
993000	1001400	Some of these videos are also monetized. The whole situation is rather disgusting, I don't doubt that, but the only reason that this video has had an effect
1001400	1007320	was because its delivery was bombastic, and it was extremely focused in its goal, almost too focused.
1007320	1026520	And that's what unnerves me about this clip, he has just shown something that is frankly terrible, and his response is people need to know they're running ads on this.
1026520	1034280	I don't know about you guys, but for me, the ads would be the bottom of my priorities. As a line, does that not just strike as a little off?
1034280	1041640	And this is one of my biggest problems, for someone who uses the defense of his cause of stopping child exploitation on YouTube as a whole,
1041640	1050120	the video seemed very focused on actually punishing rather than resolving. I don't think he offers one idea to resolve the problem throughout the whole video,
1050120	1057880	and although we're certainly not entitled to any genius solution, you'd think that someone so committed to pushing this narrative that YouTube aren't doing enough
1057880	1065720	would have an idea of how YouTube can do more. He pushes the narrative that YouTube are ignoring this, and yet doesn't really prove it.
1065720	1074120	I'm shocked when I report channels that are amalgamating this stuff, and I report guys that are timestamping this stuff, that YouTube hasn't deleted these channels.
1074120	1079800	How is this not a violation of their terms of service, and how are they not doing more? How does this exist?
1079800	1086120	He does say he's reporting the content, but also acts as if this is the first time he has encountered these specific videos.
1086120	1091160	He doesn't act as if he's revisiting the content that he's reported, and that they'll actually deal with it.
1091160	1098200	Like, if you wanted to prove something like that, it wouldn't have been too difficult to record you reporting it and then coming back a couple days later.
1098200	1106680	For me, if you're playing a hardline narrative, but which they may not be aware of anyway, it once again seems like you're not interested in resolving the issue,
1106680	1113320	but more making a video which can emotionally provoke people. And that's what it did, it's a video based on presentation.
1113320	1120520	And sure, some people may argue that it's completely justified to be angry about these comments, and you know what? I'd be angry too.
1120520	1129800	But it's when you turn that anger onto the platform, and try to go for the jugular with regards to funding, that they could have sorted out anyway, well that's when the problem arises.
1129800	1140280	And many creators picked up on this narrative, and disputed it, because essentially what Matt was saying was that the only way to deal with this problem was to light a fire under YouTube's buttocks,
1140360	1143800	to make them realise the consequences for not taking action.
1143800	1149160	Now, many people took issue with two parts of this. Firstly, with Matt's point that YouTube wasn't taking any action,
1149160	1155720	many people attested that YouTube had in fact been responding and trying to deal with these issues, and trying to run algorithms that would erase this,
1155720	1162760	so meticulously to the point that there had been incidents where channels had been suspended for merely having the initial CP involved.
1162760	1169160	As discussed earlier, it's clear that YouTube had their priorities wrong, and were dealing with the situation inefficiently,
1169160	1176200	but few with experience on the platform would argue that they weren't doing anything, or were attempting to overlook it altogether.
1176200	1182120	Many creators would point to one situation back a couple years where this was occurring in a much different form.
1182120	1191160	Pyrocynical, a creator with a significant following, made a video called Child Exploitation on YouTube, in which he documented something arguably more serious,
1191160	1196520	which was these throwaway accounts uploading content of children performing in rather sexual ways.
1196520	1201480	The uploaders were doing this with malicious intent, and some of the content was actually monetised.
1201480	1209400	So if I go onto YouTube and look up webcam video from, you can just see from the fucking thumbnails alone,
1209400	1217080	there's a girl holding panties, there's a girl skimpy clothed, with a really sexually suggestive pose on her.
1217080	1222440	And these are all called webcam video from, and then a timestamp, like the date and the year.
1222440	1228280	Now one thing I've noticed with these videos is that they're usually posted on throwaway accounts,
1228280	1237480	so I'll go and make an account, post a video of a child doing sexually explicit stuff, and then the account will be dead, never used again.
1237480	1240840	It's this perfect strategy of essentially being blameless.
1240840	1247800	It's probably the same few people that make about 20 to 30 throwaway accounts, and then just mass spam these videos.
1247800	1254920	They've basically been requested to do stuff, right, online, by someone anonymous,
1254920	1263240	and then what they'll do is they'll take the clip and then upload it to YouTube for essentially other pedophiles to enjoy.
1263240	1270120	So I hope that someone at YouTube sees this, that they catch on, that this is really fucked.
1270120	1277240	Exploitation of children in a sexual way, it's not right, totally out of fucking line.
1277240	1281160	YouTube needs to get on this shit, and they need to crack down on these fuckers.
1281160	1288200	Their videos are monetized, they've had to submit so much legal information to get the videos monetized.
1288200	1289960	YouTube has their information.
1289960	1294680	They could shut down their account, they could pass their name onto the police.
1294680	1299480	I'm sure some of them have forged information or faked it to get the videos monetized.
1299480	1303800	If they had half a fucking brain cell, then yeah, definitely.
1303800	1306520	But I'm pretty sure there's ways to circumvent that.
1306520	1312440	In his video, Pyrocynical remained rather collected and advised YouTube to take a clear stance on the issue,
1312440	1316520	and within 24 hours or so, much of the content had been dealt with.
1316520	1325000	So firstly, the effect of that video, pretty much every single video I found and I referenced has been taken down from YouTube.
1325000	1331720	I can't find the videos, and when I go on my browser history to find them, they've usually been taken down for sexually explicit content.
1331720	1341080	So that video did have a positive effect, because these videos I saw of children acting in a sexually explicit manner have now been removed, which is great.
1341080	1344920	This is exactly what I wanted, and exactly what the community needs.
1344920	1347480	So thank you again so much for that.
1347480	1356280	You do realize that after I made the video, a lot, and I mean a lot of these videos were taken down for sexually explicit content.
1356280	1359880	Within those 24 hours, the search results did change a lot.
1359960	1367400	And even in smaller situations, like Cavos' video that barely caught 30,000 views, the content in question was also handled.
1367400	1375320	So this leads to our second argument, that many people felt like this did not need to be escalated to the point of advertisers being involved.
1375320	1381400	Now I don't think it's completely unfair to argue that maybe if the punishment is harsh enough, YouTube might take note,
1381400	1387880	but at the same time, it's quite clear that YouTube do pay attention to the videos when they pick up content like this,
1387880	1395160	partly because it is implied through the content that if they don't deal with it, then it could snowball further, which is why they are particularly attentive.
1395160	1399960	Now on one hand, you could make the argument that YouTube hasn't done enough, and I think that's fair.
1399960	1407240	At the same time, their algorithms probably reviewed content on an individual basis that didn't take into context what the problem was,
1407240	1411320	the problem being how much this content was considered normal to these children,
1411320	1421160	and likewise, the fact that it was more a rabbit hole manipulated by an algorithm probably designed to merely recommend the same sort of content and keep people on the website as long as possible.
1421160	1431000	It's not something you would necessarily notice when doing individual reviews, it's almost like a virus, this algorithm hijacked by pedos imitating all the other algorithms.
1431000	1438120	It's a new type of problem that may not have been pointed out to them, because YouTube's report mechanism doesn't necessarily address those issues.
1438200	1444360	So honestly, I think it was warranting of a video, because this is clearly a new problem that you have to communicate.
1444360	1449640	However, the tone does seem very questionable, and he seems overly obsessed with the advertisers.
1449640	1452040	Um, holy shit, for real?
1452040	1458840	Oh! Fuck yes, man! Sorry, I swore, I'm sorry. Yes! Dude, that's what I'm talking about!
1458840	1464200	Did it, I'm happy. Thank you so much, everybody! I just made the video, thank you!
1464200	1468840	That's great. Because you know why that's great? Not because I want to see YouTube suffer.
1468840	1473720	I mean, I kind of do in a way, I want them to do something about this. I know it's a challenging issue.
1473720	1481800	I get it, but because the only way to get YouTube to listen, it seems like, is by hitting them where it hurts.
1481800	1489880	Maybe it's just me, but I feel like if the number one goal was to remove that sort of content from YouTube, that sort of reaction would be a bit premature.
1489880	1493880	It just doesn't give off a good impression about what he really wants from this.
1493880	1501000	At the end of the video, he has this rather contrived montage of all these creators who have had run-ins with the YouTube monetisation system.
1501000	1508760	The solutions that YouTube come up with will not make it easier on those guys, or us, it'll just make YouTube more paranoid and more restrictive,
1508760	1514600	and I genuinely don't believe that he necessarily is particularly invested in that final montage.
1514600	1524120	And that's okay, if you think that's a sacrifice worth making, but don't necessarily plug in the creators there, because you think it's gonna win you some credits.
1524120	1529640	I want to round this out by saying that I am very aware of the allegations of the content that he made in the past,
1529720	1538120	the very weird sexual content, and the nofap stuff, and frankly, I do find it rather strange that given his former uploads, he'd suddenly take the stance.
1538120	1545320	I mean, he shouts at an underage girl and asks her if they want to be in an adult film, and his best response to this was to say that she wasn't underage.
1545320	1552840	Crazy sociopath, dude. He's trying to say that these videos that I made, that this woman right here is a kid.
1552840	1563400	Like, what? I mean, this is so crazy, dude. That's so wild. That's the craziest thing. Yeah. That's so nuts.
1563400	1573240	Which I kinda doubt, given his record on judging ages. But at the same time, he may be a reformed man, and I hate cancel culture, but he shouldn't have made excuses at least.
1573240	1584440	His video itself had the evidence, and some points to take note of, but I just never personally enjoyed his presentation, because it seems to me there's an agenda that's not necessarily intertwined with protecting the kids.
1584440	1593240	I can't look inside his mind and tell his intentions, but I have my opinions, and so did other creators, and that's where this becomes even more divisive.
1593240	1608920	So with all this laid out, although I can understand why Matt brings an important issue to the front of the site, people might have had real problems with his approach, not just in how it was presented, but the sort of things that he was suggesting.
1608920	1617320	We should really establish two points that everyone should be happy with. No one wants this on their platform, but we also want to minimise the possible collateral damage,
1617320	1624040	and given the differing perceptions on how YouTube is dealing with this, and how they have dealt with this in the past, this will lead to different positions.
1624040	1631960	Which also led to a lot of creators taking issue with what he was saying, as it places them in the firing line due to an issue that may not have deserved such a reaction.
1631960	1638520	Awesome. Now again, look guys, this means that YouTubers are gonna suffer, unfortunately.
1638520	1652120	Now yes, of course YouTubers are gonna be more vocal about this when it's their livelihoods at stake, I think that's only natural, but at the same time, not everyone invested in the criticism is a YouTuber, nor are they someone who completely relies on the platform for their income.
1652120	1659000	I personally am very grateful for the income that YouTube provides, and it gives me much more creative license, but my life does not depend on it.
1659080	1670600	One of the biggest issues that many YouTubers immediately took was that Matt came across as a bit of a novice, not really experienced with the community, and certainly not convinced on any of his views other than the advertiser one.
1670600	1675080	Let's play some clips and take them apart briefly, to understand where people were coming from.
1675640	1678440	Okay, Nick, what do you propose YouTube do?
1680280	1700520	I don't know. Do you want to know what I think, actually? I think that YouTube has to know about this stuff, but they actually can't do anything, because in order to do something, they would have to rewrite their entire algorithm, which is some kind of huge conglomeration of so many miniature algorithms.
1701480	1712200	But regardless, what they need to do is they need to have people that work 24-7. Let me give you this example. Who was that who just wrote that comment? Let me get his name again. Nick, let me give you an example.
1712200	1722520	If you go to a website like Pornhub, and you try and find these kind of videos, actually try and find these videos on a pornographic website like Pornhub, you can't find them.
1722520	1736360	I'm sure they're on that platform. I'm sure if I went deep enough, I'm sure if I tried to talk to the right people, I could probably find those videos on a website like Pornhub, but I can't find them. Yet on YouTube, I can find them within five clicks.
1736360	1750680	First of all, that's not how you use a Blue Yeti. Secondly, if you genuinely don't think YouTube can do anything, why did you want to punish them so badly to make them do something? Personally, I think YouTube could do more, but this sudden defeatist tone seems surprisingly inconsistent.
1753080	1756040	I mean, this girl's like a teenager, even this is borderline.
1756040	1761480	No Matt, that's Corinna Cough, she's 23, and yes, Matt is out of sync, that's nothing to do with me.
1761480	1768360	However, on the other hand, there were points where Matt came across as very reasonable, and much more reasonable than he did in his original video.
1768360	1778760	Ryan, why aren't my videos showing up when you search them? If you're talking about my video that I uploaded about this whole issue, it's because it has sexual in the title, so YouTube basically doesn't want that showing up in trending or anything.
1778760	1791000	It's not a conspiracy. How am I not trending again, like it's because I have sexual in the title? YouTube doesn't want that trending because they don't want to upset advertisers. The irony, right?
1791000	1796280	It's not that YouTube is shit, man, it's just like they don't know how to deal with this issue, you know?
1796280	1804600	It seems strangely inconsistent, which although reasonability is completely welcomed, it makes the tone of the original video seem slightly disingenuous.
1804600	1814520	Like, if I didn't believe people were ignoring something, and they genuinely cared, and they were just stuck on the solution, I wouldn't have hammered them in that way, in that tone, to deliver that sort of retribution.
1814520	1828280	Now with all this in mind, some YouTubers decided to take it to him. The main opposition coming from Keemstar, who took the very passionate position that YouTube care about this issue, are responding, and are doing something, and that Matt was being dishonest in the way that he behaved.
1828280	1834680	Keem said he had passed on the information behind the scenes, but didn't want another adpocalypse, so he wasn't going to boost it.
1834680	1845720	Now, Keem is a controversial figure for many justified reasons, but his stance on this matter didn't seem malicious, and as seen in other clips, Matt doesn't seem innately angry, and yet this tweet completely sets him off.
1845720	1852280	Yeah, well, you know what, dude? I guess what that shows is that you don't care. You care more about your fucking money.
1852280	1862840	Wow. You care more about your money. This guy, I don't like this dude, you know? You care more about money than you do about protecting people, you know?
1862840	1868200	So what if it affects you? Go work at fucking KFC, bro. Hokey motherf- okay, sorry, I shouldn't swear.
1868200	1876360	Damn, that's bullshit, you know? Get a part-time job, my guy, you know? Uber looks good for you.
1876360	1881560	This is a theme that we see in a lot of his responses, I'm not going to play them all because they're rather similar.
1881560	1887960	A lot of his streams are just him repeating a lot of these same points, and this becomes particularly prevalent when dealing with people like this.
1887960	1897640	He tells people that they need to get jobs, and this isn't just restricted to controversial people like Keemstar, this is the same with other much less partisan commentators like Nerd City and Leon Lush.
1898200	1916920	There you go. Yeah, well, yeah, well, you know, I'm frustrated because this turned out, you know? Yeah, that's right, here we go again.
1916920	1920280	And then he'd say he doesn't want to be angry with them and wants a discussion.
1920280	1931080	I'd like to talk to the guy, like, I don't want to be angry with you. Sorry, what's his name again? I don't want to be angry with you. Fuck, I don't remember your name, sorry dude, I'm kind of all over the place.
1931080	1944760	Yeah, so yeah, I'd go for it. Leon Lush, yeah, for sure. How can we set that up? Yeah, let's make it happen, for sure. I don't want to be upset with this guy, I want to talk to him.
1944920	1954200	But either way, this divided the community deeply, to the point where there was basically this learn to code narrative, and sure, YouTubers are probably somewhat self-interested,
1954200	1961880	but their arguments are not completely illogical, and when Keemstar actually called in, Matt seemed very submissive towards him and the points that he was making.
1961880	1974520	Brother, I don't have a Twitter, I'm literally so, I will make a Twitter when I come home. I would love to talk to you, I would love to talk to you, I don't think you're a bad guy, I'd love to talk to you, I'd love to get your opinion.
1974600	1987640	I'd love to get your insight, you're a big YouTuber, you're a part of this platform, I'd love to talk to you, I will make a Twitter, and I'll, yeah, so, brother, when I'm at work, I'll try and make a Twitter, and I want to talk-
1987640	1999960	So suddenly his moments of spontaneous rage seem completely unhinged or contrived to rile up the audience. YouTubers are gonna argue their case, telling them to get a job just reflects the cynical elitism that we see a lot now.
1999960	2011320	YouTube is not typical employment, it's much more a contracted agreement, but it's still a paid position for some people, and I don't appreciate the fact that people tend to look down on it as this sort of job that people who have failed elsewhere have.
2011320	2020920	And sure, there is no guarantee of payment, but I like the fact that YouTube can be paid, I think it pushes some great content onto a free platform, and such a vision should not be given up on.
2020920	2026760	I'll take Matt Watson on any career path, lil bitch. In one of his other streams, Matt says this.
2026760	2038760	I'm not gonna get into politics, because frankly I'm not smart enough to really talk about this, but in a capitalist society, the only way to really hit big corporations is monetarily.
2038760	2055240	So I'm not here to try and brigade advertisers, I just want this to be known, to be talked about, for YouTube to acknowledge that they're doing something about it, that they're improving their stipulations regarding enforcing their minimum age requirements,
2055240	2063800	and that maybe they can be more transparent with the YouTubers who actually put out great content about what they can and cannot say.
2063800	2078120	And this has been bugging me for a while, because he places the blame of having to go in on YouTube onto the quote capitalist society, and yet he encourages YouTubers who criticise him to go and take jobs at Uber and KFC in response to their criticisms of him.
2078120	2085320	Probably some of the greatest examples of completely unaccountable companies who benefit off the system that Watson despises so much.
2085320	2089000	You wanna know why companies like the BBC swept it under the rug for so long?
2089000	2097160	YouTube defies many of its business counterparts because you can start off with very, very little, very small investments, and you can transform it.
2097160	2103160	It's not perfect, but it's certainly better than KFC or Uber, who have a very stiff hierarchy indeed.
2103160	2117720	YouTube is good because it doesn't completely represent that. Having you tell a load of YouTubers who arguably have a platform that can call this dangerous stuff up to just go and get a job at a place where they will have no voice at all, as if that would stop the child exploitation,
2117720	2126120	you can't use child exploitation as a catchall defence. It's like suggesting that people against the death penalty are defending the people who commit heinous crimes.
2126120	2134920	At the end of all this, he posted an unapologetic Reddit response which affirmed his status as a YouTube martyr who's too good for the internet plebs.
2134920	2142280	It was more of the melodramatic content that I'd expect from him, as well as an outro ramble about Keemstar and his evil ways.
2142280	2146920	I could break this down, but I think it's quite clear now he's just a bit clueless.
2147000	2154040	After having to sit through a lot of Matt Watson's streams, I don't think he's completely as calculated as his first video represented.
2154040	2165320	I thought that video was orchestrated and manipulative, but since then it seems he's just someone who's clearly set out a goal in his head, get those advertisers, and then has literally no idea on what to do next.
2165320	2175640	He gets confused, he gets frustrated, and says stupid things. And honestly, even though some people were annoyed he was abandoning his post, it was probably for the best.
2175640	2182040	He wasn't really achieving anything. Even with all that said, I don't think he was the worst perpetrator in this situation.
2182040	2187080	But James, we've gone through all the suspects in the room, who could it be? Well, let's see.
2187080	2197720	Let's say YouTube get all of the under 13 owned accounts off the platform. Let's say they disable YouTube comment sections in which people write their inappropriate timestamps and so on.
2197720	2204280	Let's say they managed to work out exactly what videos were good and appropriate and what videos were not.
2204280	2212520	Even though this is a rather implausible scenario, I would then pose the question to you, the viewer, will Keto stop using the platform?
2212520	2224920	The answer is a resounding no. At the end of the day, you have family content being uploaded, where children do childish things, and parents upload it because they're proud, there are videos on YouTube of my brother playing the violin when he was younger.
2224920	2230760	One of the first problems we encountered were those strange comments, even when the videos had next to no views whatsoever.
2230760	2237800	Now my dad dealt with the problem because he's a responsible guy, but my point still stands, my brother was literally playing the violin.
2237800	2246680	If you upload content with children onto the internet, there is a significant possibility that anything that they post might be taken and used for unsavoury purposes.
2246680	2250920	If you cannot conceive the thought of that, then don't let your children online.
2250920	2261080	YouTube could have done more, in firstly sorting out the algorithm, secondly turning off comments because that breaks up the rings slightly, and it prevents a child from perhaps being humiliated or harassed.
2261080	2268840	On top of that, they could maybe delete some of the channels that were run by children, but there will always be enough content with children in on YouTube, that's unavoidable.
2268840	2275000	Matt's video was manipulative, for sure, but it was so heavy handed, it should have been obvious.
2275000	2283480	And that's what annoyed me, the only thing exceptional about this situation was the fact that people could see it publicly, and they could respond by doing something that didn't affect them.
2283480	2294360	The threat those comments provided was that they could be considered sexual harassment of the child, not that they indicate pedos were watching videos, because pedos will continue to watch videos regardless.
2294360	2302840	Many social media sites have it much worse than YouTube because they actually have private DMs, thus making them much more vulnerable than any YouTube uploader.
2302840	2310920	We've dealt with pedos in this community before, who have utilised both Twitter and Discord messaging services to solicit content that many people would be shocked by.
2310920	2322600	Twitter themselves have been overrun by pedos recently, who have set up their support chats as documented by multiple people, and Discord have just emerged from a scandal that had alleged grooming rings occurring in private servers.
2322600	2328760	And yet surprisingly, there was no passionate video directed at them, demanding that we go after their income at the jugular.
2328760	2336360	I recently released a video about Meldy Officiel Tres, a 12-year-old with approximately 4 million followers receiving those comments.
2336360	2344360	Instagram is literally stood on the sides, and that rabbit hole goes deeper, and deeper, and deeper on Instagram. Instagram is genuinely terrible.
2344360	2353080	This does not negate the problems that YouTube has, I need to emphasise that. No, what I'm saying is that people's outrage at this specific situation is unbelievably selective,
2353080	2362680	and if you really care about your child not being used as pedo fodder, then firstly you'd stop them from going online, you'd stop them from going outdoors in public, and you'd have to shelter them completely.
2362680	2373480	It's an inconvenient truth, the internet as a whole makes it easier for them, you'd have to do something brandicool like shut down the internet or ban kids, or something that will just be unbelievably invasive.
2373480	2380600	If there's one thing that I could say about Matt is that at least he was consistent in his beliefs, I mean this was one of the solutions that he supported.
2380600	2390280	Many South Korean websites require users to submit a valid registration number to create an account, that is brilliant, there you go, thank you so much LFP.
2390280	2398440	Anybody, you know, some of the reporters I'm talking to, I'm gonna mention that to them, because I want them to bring that up.
2398440	2407560	I highly doubt many of the people who were initially riled up by such a video would be willing to hand over records to an authority like that, particularly given how easily prone to abuse that would be.
2407560	2416360	I certainly wouldn't, but at the same time I accept that freedom comes with liabilities, you can't select what sort of outrage compass you want on the basis that it affects you.
2416360	2427800	As I said in my Bud A video, the best weapon we have right now is education, to make sure children when approached by online predators can report this, and to feel like they have a voice if they are ever put into these scenarios.
2427800	2442120	But there is no way of completely avoiding it, and we can't just plug our ears and pretend they don't exist until we see them and then become really upset because they've shown themselves, then demand that the platform makes us not see them anymore as if that will just make them fucking vaporise.
2442120	2453000	And regardless, they will come back on some new website that they'll create a group chat on and do what they gotta do, linking videos whether YouTube has disabled the comment sections or not, you're not gonna stop them.
2453000	2465160	It is our job to make it as hard for them as possible without a doubt, but the utopian idea that we completely prevented would only be achieved through extreme authoritarian policies, and very few people would support it.
2465160	2479160	So what was the outrage worth then? Well YouTube changed some policies, became even stricter on monetisation, and we got another adpocalypse that was debatable in its necessity, and let's be honest, the only reason we got it was because it didn't affect a majority of people.
2479160	2487640	If advertisers didn't listen and YouTube didn't listen, would people have gone one step further and stopped using YouTube altogether to protest? No, of course they wouldn't.
2487640	2501080	In the instances of Discord and Twitter, they have been responding to the outrage despite the fact that no one has really gone for their main sources of income, because image is a long term thing that does matter, regardless of how much money you're making right now.
2501080	2510040	I said this in my tweet, but if you were angry about pedos online, you would be angry all the time, and if a website can do more, we should always make them do more.
2510040	2520840	But spare me, the pseudo-moral outrage, it seems like disingenuous bollocks. If people genuinely care about this as this whole situation makes them out to be, then there's a lot of work to be done.
2520840	2534920	I don't expect everyone to be completely morally consistent, in fact no one is, but if you're calling on something with great impact, then I think it probably matters a bit more that we evaluate what we're doing before making moves that could affect people's livelihoods.
2534920	2550600	And that's the thing that annoyed me, whenever people brought into question this whole discussion, there was always this one person who asserted that they must not care about the wellbeing of children, that's never the case, but if you care about the wellbeing of children that much, then you'll be pushing for a lot more than YouTube's removal of content.
2550600	2561000	Honestly, I think people were led on by that video. At the same time, I think we as YouTubers need to realise that this is what cultivating a really negative perception of YouTube yields.
2561000	2568680	YouTube deserve to be held to account, but equally projecting them as a business who will do nothing to sort the platform out is coming back to haunt them.
2568680	2575400	Doesn't mean that YouTube shouldn't be criticised, they've made some terrible decisions over the last few months, and I'm more than happy to point them out,
2575400	2584760	but cooking up a narrative that means people will only see YouTube in the worst light in every situation is risky business, and this risk has not paid off.
2584760	2593560	Not for us, not for YouTube, in fact the only person it's paid off for is Matt, and now he's in the sin bin anyway, and I doubt he'll ever come back.
2593560	2604600	So, there is the video, joyous times as ever, but not the most fun one to make, but I hope I covered everything, at least somewhat comprehensively,
2604600	2617960	because it's a really tough topic, and I didn't want to be seen as giving too much credit to anyone, or not enough credit to anyone, because there was positives and negatives to be given to both sides in this instance.
2618200	2627640	With this, I want to thank the editors again, they will be up on screen and in the pinned comment, go check them out, go send them some love, they really, really do deserve it.
2627640	2633160	I doubt this was an easy one for them to make either, so I really appreciate their commitment on that front.
2633160	2642360	Also, I need to thank my Patreons, who've once again been very generous and I really appreciate it, and I also have to thank individually, Connor at $50,
2642600	2658680	Somehullerblue, also at $50, thank you guys so much, much love in my heart for you, also massive thank you to Evening Steel too, another $50 Patreon, who donated fairly late on in the last month, so I had to slip this little section in, thank you so much.
2658680	2672120	And also, stepping up there to $100, Brandon and Ryan, who I know what they're on, but some good shit, I really appreciate it guys, it makes so much difference to me, and it does not go unnoticed.
2672360	2679160	But yeah, pretty tired, pretty exhausted, but pleased to have got this down and recorded, and I hope it comes out alright in the end.
2679160	2683160	Until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you in the next one.
2702120	2704120	Thanks for watching!
