00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Well, here we are.

00:03.000 --> 00:08.000
Fuck being on some chill shit. We go 0 to 100 nigga real quick.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
And hey, that's pretty good.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
It's taken its time, but I've made my first milestone a hundred.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
Hopefully not my last achievement in my hugely successful lifespan.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
And as a special treat, I'm going to reveal parts of my body.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
This time, my finger.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
And as a special treat, I'm going to reveal parts of my body.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
And as a special treat, I'm going to reveal parts of my body.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
And as a special treat, I'm going to reveal parts of my body.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
And as a special treat, I'm going to reveal parts of my body.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
And as a special treat, I'm going to reveal parts of my body.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
And as a special treat, I'm going to reveal parts of my body.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
And as a special treat, I'm going to reveal parts of my body.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
And as a special treat, I'm going to reveal parts of my body.

01:34.000 --> 01:54.360
Oh yeah, look at that symmetry, wow, what a wonderful finger.

01:54.360 --> 01:58.760
If you get me to 500 I might even show you my hand.

01:58.760 --> 02:04.280
It would be like a game of hangman, without the noose, hopefully.

02:04.280 --> 02:08.160
But for real, I really appreciate it, the huge wave of support I've received recently

02:08.160 --> 02:12.720
has been unreal, and without this wonderful amp discord, I doubt I'd be celebrating such

02:12.720 --> 02:15.220
a pioneering accomplishment.

02:15.220 --> 02:19.960
I've done some collabs, even a couple podcasts, expanding has been a lot of fun recently,

02:19.960 --> 02:24.200
I also wouldn't have done it without the support of my friends to set this channel up.

02:24.200 --> 02:29.160
I am eternally grateful, and the gratitude can be shown in the sidebar of my channel,

02:29.160 --> 02:36.160
I suggest you check some of their content out.

02:36.160 --> 02:41.560
Now as I'm such a generous, virtuous, ethical, principle, righteous human being, I'll take

02:41.560 --> 02:47.840
suggestions on what to do to celebrate this huge feat on YouTube that I'm sure the management

02:47.840 --> 02:50.420
are celebrating as well.

02:50.420 --> 02:54.660
You can leave your suggestions in the comments below, or you can contact me over one of the

02:54.660 --> 02:58.700
social mediums and I will decide what's most reasonable.

02:58.700 --> 03:04.620
I won't do anything offensive by the actual definition, nor will I do a face reveal, that

03:04.620 --> 03:11.560
will probably come at around 10 million subscribers, maybe something a bit more ambitious actually.

03:11.560 --> 03:16.200
So yeah, drop me your suggestions and I might just listen to them, if I'm in a good mood

03:16.200 --> 03:17.200
that is.

03:17.200 --> 03:20.260
I look forward to hearing them.

03:20.260 --> 03:40.420
Anyway, I'm The Right Opinion, and thanks, seriously.
