00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Well, here we are.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Fuck being on some chill shit. We go 0 to 100 nigga real quick.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And hey, that's pretty good.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's taken its time, but I've made my first milestone a hundred.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hopefully not my last achievement in my hugely successful lifespan.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And as a special treat, I'm going to reveal parts of my body.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This time, my finger.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And as a special treat, I'm going to reveal parts of my body.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And as a special treat, I'm going to reveal parts of my body.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And as a special treat, I'm going to reveal parts of my body.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And as a special treat, I'm going to reveal parts of my body.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And as a special treat, I'm going to reveal parts of my body.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And as a special treat, I'm going to reveal parts of my body.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And as a special treat, I'm going to reveal parts of my body.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And as a special treat, I'm going to reveal parts of my body.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:54,360
Oh yeah, look at that symmetry, wow, what a wonderful finger.

18
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,760
If you get me to 500 I might even show you my hand.

19
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,280
It would be like a game of hangman, without the noose, hopefully.

20
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,160
But for real, I really appreciate it, the huge wave of support I've received recently

21
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,720
has been unreal, and without this wonderful amp discord, I doubt I'd be celebrating such

22
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,220
a pioneering accomplishment.

23
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,960
I've done some collabs, even a couple podcasts, expanding has been a lot of fun recently,

24
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,200
I also wouldn't have done it without the support of my friends to set this channel up.

25
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,160
I am eternally grateful, and the gratitude can be shown in the sidebar of my channel,

26
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:36,160
I suggest you check some of their content out.

27
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,560
Now as I'm such a generous, virtuous, ethical, principle, righteous human being, I'll take

28
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,840
suggestions on what to do to celebrate this huge feat on YouTube that I'm sure the management

29
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,420
are celebrating as well.

30
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,660
You can leave your suggestions in the comments below, or you can contact me over one of the

31
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,700
social mediums and I will decide what's most reasonable.

32
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:04,620
I won't do anything offensive by the actual definition, nor will I do a face reveal, that

33
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:11,560
will probably come at around 10 million subscribers, maybe something a bit more ambitious actually.

34
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,200
So yeah, drop me your suggestions and I might just listen to them, if I'm in a good mood

35
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,200
that is.

36
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,260
I look forward to hearing them.

37
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:40,420
Anyway, I'm The Right Opinion, and thanks, seriously.
