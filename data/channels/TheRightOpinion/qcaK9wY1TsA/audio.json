And as a special treat, I'm going to reveal parts of my body. Oh yeah, look at that symmetry, wow, what a wonderful finger. If you get me to 500 I might even show you my hand. It would be like a game of hangman, without the noose, hopefully. But for real, I really appreciate it, the huge wave of support I've received recently has been unreal, and without this wonderful amp discord, I doubt I'd be celebrating such a pioneering accomplishment. I've done some collabs, even a couple podcasts, expanding has been a lot of fun recently, I also wouldn't have done it without the support of my friends to set this channel up. I am eternally grateful, and the gratitude can be shown in the sidebar of my channel, I suggest you check some of their content out. Now as I'm such a generous, virtuous, ethical, principle, righteous human being, I'll take suggestions on what to do to celebrate this huge feat on YouTube that I'm sure the management are celebrating as well. You can leave your suggestions in the comments below, or you can contact me over one of the social mediums and I will decide what's most reasonable. I won't do anything offensive by the actual definition, nor will I do a face reveal, that will probably come at around 10 million subscribers, maybe something a bit more ambitious actually. So yeah, drop me your suggestions and I might just listen to them, if I'm in a good mood that is. I look forward to hearing them.
