00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,680
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,640
too much free time. And my oh my, do we have a topic on our hands today. I know this is

3
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,440
late but honestly it's a subject that has taken made twists and turns, that it was worth

4
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,260
waiting just in case any final revelations were brought forward, and obviously this video

5
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,960
does not exempt the fact that there may be further twists and turns in the case, and

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,380
also does not mean that any new unrelated information may compromise the character of

7
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:49,040
those involved. So let's talk about gaming festivals, who loves them? I mean honestly

8
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,160
I think gaming festivals would be really swell if there were less people, or no people even,

9
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,760
because I do like video games but I don't like having to wait to play them, often I just find myself

10
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,640
aimlessly wandering and occasionally bumping into people who I may have seen at previous

11
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,000
events and retaking the same photo, just this time with a slightly greater inkling of fatigue

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,160
reflected in my weary smile. The pinball machines are good though, especially when you don't

13
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,680
have to pave them, hooray for free things. Anyhow, the gaming festival that is of interest

14
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,920
is Insomnia Gaming Festival 64, abbreviated to i64, this ran from the Easter weekend from

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,840
the 19th to the 22nd of April, I saw a lot of close friends again, and met a lot of great

16
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,560
creators. It's always nice to do so, because it humanises all these people, and puts the

17
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,000
internet into perspective. One of these people I met at the event was a bloke called Michael,

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,800
known online as Slazo, he was pleasant, I had some facetious flirtatious exchanges with

19
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,200
him, and after the event my life carried on, I knew some of the creators that I had met

20
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,600
there were going to London afterwards, Slazo included, and I would have joined them, but

21
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,480
alas, I had university to complete, and I still felt that YouTube was an unstable source

22
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,400
of income, so I wanted something to fall back onto in case everything fell apart. A few

23
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,400
weeks later, around mid-May, I was alternating between university work and checking my social

24
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,220
blade when one of my acquaintances messaged me quite shocking news, apparently Slazo,

25
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:14,240
the person who I'd met at i64, was going to be exposed, as a predator, he was just

26
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,140
as surprised as I was, apparently these claims were going to be published on a twitlonger

27
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,180
in the following week. So I waited with anticipation, as I hadn't actually seen any of the evidence,

28
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,620
I didn't really talk to anyone about it, although I did tell one of my friends who

29
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,800
was making a documentary about i64 to perhaps consider excluding any footage with him in,

30
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,940
in case it might taint the finished product, more as an act of caution really. So I waited,

31
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:42,580
and waited, and waited. A month later a twitlonger was published by a person named Fizzypop,

32
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:47,240
who goes by the name of Che, it documented the allegations against Slazo, these allegations

33
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,640
painted him as a sex-hungry predator who exploited the innocence and inexperience

34
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,400
of a younger individual in the relationship, aggressively obtaining gratification when

35
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,600
she didn't want to offer it. This was met with immediate support from the community,

36
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,840
including many large youtubers, it was clearly a very emotional topic for many people and

37
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,460
many wanted to show their support for a victim. Alongside the twitlonger, there was a substantial

38
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:14,300
amount of screenshots that appeared to provide irrefutable evidence that Slazo was behaving

39
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,380
in just this fashion, including multiple allusions to sexual assault which seemed to

40
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:23,300
corroborate her testimony. I may naturally hesitant person however, so I decided to wait

41
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,740
a bit more. Obviously I didn't really blame anyone who wanted to show their support because

42
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,800
many of them are clearly invested, and many people behind the scenes may have information

43
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,300
that I may not be privy to, and the screenshots themselves were undoubtedly compelling. It

44
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,900
was a few days later that DramaAlert reported on the situation, with a screenshot of Slazo's

45
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,380
initial statement. It was nothing too revealing, said some of the claims were false or exceptionally

46
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,400
misleading, and understandably said that he would be working on a reply that would take

47
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,600
a little more time. He also said that he was caught off guard by these claims as he had

48
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,980
met Che since the relationship and supposedly put it all behind them. My judgement was skeptical

49
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,520
of his statement at this point, but if he was prepared to reply then I expected him

50
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,920
to have something at least. However then Fizzy Pop decided to release an additional response

51
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,520
to Slazo's statement. It is stated that they had a conversation on Instagram in which Slazo

52
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,880
did not deny any of the claims that she made, thus incriminating him further. Many people

53
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,400
once again stood behind these claims and supported Che with what she was saying, no one with

54
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,880
any decent amount of common sense was going to instigate grief onto a possible victim

55
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,460
of sexual predation. However, behind the scenes something didn't sit right with me, I already

56
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,400
mentioned this in a previous video and I'll go into more depth later, but looking at the

57
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,780
conversation something about the tone of Che just made me uncomfortable, so I confronted

58
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,160
Slazo and told him that, although he's deserving of some very genuine criticism, if it had

59
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,360
been taken out of context like he claimed, in spite of the risk, it would be worth showing

60
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,940
the additional content because the importance of protecting your social image is vital.

61
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,160
These are things that will stick with someone for life, and if she has shown what would

62
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,380
frame you as terrible, if you say you want to show evidence but then don't, people will

63
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:04,580
take that, well as it seems, incriminating. Our conversation ended and I waited for his

64
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,460
video, and on the evening of June 27th he finally responded, it was a strong video,

65
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,860
I had to watch it a few times through, and once again I'll save my thoughts for later

66
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,840
on. Although I was pleased he had managed to present his side, I was also anticipating

67
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,500
possible additional responses, as said, at this point in time it felt like a situation

68
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,040
that was mostly between him and Che, although it had caught my attention that certain people

69
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,140
had openly taken credit when the initial statement came out, I assumed that their involvement

70
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,340
would be addressed when we had assessed the validity of the claims. However, what quickly

71
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,600
happened was a descent into community civil war, many people who had been involved in

72
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,800
the release of the original statement decided to tweet out further comments, many of these

73
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,240
people decided to continue backing Che, however, many of their statements were vague and also

74
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,100
frustrated many audiences. This led to pressure on creators to hashtag apologize to Slazo,

75
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,760
the messy responses provoked videos and streams from many smaller creators placing pressure

76
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,620
and stimulating further attacks which caused significant sub losses, particularly for one

77
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,820
creator, I Am Ali, the creator involved with the largest social presence. Nonetheless,

78
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,860
this whole situation hit a multitude of creators involved, with incriminating screenshots and

79
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,140
additional claims affecting their image and causing more and more drama which escalated

80
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:22,100
to the climax that left us where we are today. But what exactly happened, and why did it?

81
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,700
Well let's have a discussion, as a freeface I do know many of the creators personally,

82
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,580
and therefore, I will naturally seek to defend their character, however, criticism is criticism

83
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,120
and there is a lot to dish out, and a lot of information out there to clear up as well,

84
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,740
so let's go to the beginning of this story.

85
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,500
As said, I had heard about these allegations a month before their publication, however,

86
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,900
there wasn't really much I could do as I had seen no evidence, however, when the allegations

87
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,760
were initially released, they were pretty much supported universally, with a few exceptions,

88
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,120
and understandably so, however, with the knowledge that we have now, that this wasn't exactly

89
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,540
representative of the truth, I want to reflect on the original Twitlonger. The first thing

90
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,940
that I really want to do here is the premise for the Twitlonger's existence, this is both

91
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,680
mentioned at the start and at the end, typically, when we come forward with public claims against

92
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,160
a person, we might want to justify why these claims are necessary. Now I'd argue sometimes

93
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,120
a justification isn't necessary, in cases of severe trauma, it might take a while to come forward

94
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,800
with such allegations, however, it's clear that Che felt that there were conditions that needed to be

95
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,080
fulfilled, in the Twitlonger's instance, the point was that she had been informed Slazo had been

96
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,680
repeating a trend of creepy behaviour that he exhibited to her during a relationship that was

97
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,800
rather predatory and abusive. Now these claims do not directly imply that Slazo has been repeating

98
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,000
this exact pattern of behaviour, but what the author of the Twitlonger implied was that as a public figure,

99
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,840
if Slazo has an incapability to behave responsibly, then he shouldn't be in a position of power at all.

100
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,280
As I mentioned in my Austin Jones video, the sort of dedication that many stans might have influences

101
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,240
their judgement, and therefore, many girls may be susceptible to a predator in a powerful position.

102
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,040
Therefore, with the assertion that he is up to no good, Che presents a testimony that paints Slazo

103
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,760
in a particularly negative light. You have two sides to this Twitlonger, the stories and the screenshots,

104
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:22,040
now normally the screenshots would be used to substantiate the individual claims, however, with regards to

105
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,520
these screenshots that Che posted, they are more to corroborate the idea of credibility, this is mainly

106
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,360
because many of the testimonies provided are anecdotal, and it would be difficult to directly corroborate them.

107
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,640
The screenshots in this instance set the foundations that Slazo would be someone likely to commit behaviour

108
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,160
reported on in the Twitlonger. DMs will never directly reflect what happens in real life, but whatever they

109
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,360
showed, it revealed someone very forceful in what they wanted from Che. Probably the most incriminating

110
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,520
screenshots are shown at the top, that seem to show Slazo and Che discussing a non-conceptual act from the

111
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,800
position of hindsight, and although it seemed like he was regretful of it, it also seemed to yield a strange

112
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:07,480
obsession from an urge, as he said it. That urge seems like something that is hard to control, and appears to be

113
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,240
the greatest threat if he is continuing to behave with the mentality that he has expressed in these messages.

114
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,560
Many people took this as definitive evidence that Slazo was a predator, but there were a few details that

115
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,960
made me rather hesitant at the time. The first was that I had been told of additional details when I was informed

116
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:29,400
in May that didn't make it in the first Twitlonger, arguably this evidence that I was told of was some of the

117
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,680
most incriminating, and although I reserve thought for the possibility that these may be held off due to

118
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,960
possible police involvement, the fact that they had not been mentioned at all, not even in the context of the

119
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,160
idea that they had been passed on to the relative authorities, confused me. Once again, I was not certain about

120
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,360
the circumstances surrounding that information, and the evidence was still convincing on its own terms, but it

121
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:56,120
was a personal note I had to take. However, something that was a bit more publicly identifiable was a weird

122
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,120
contradiction that caught my attention. This was the talk about how people could change, and although I agree

123
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,560
that people can change, if what was claimed was true, it would be less of a case of whether he had changed,

124
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,120
and more of a case of at least being somewhat accountable for causing a substantial amount of trauma.

125
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,800
It is important to note that at the time of the relationship, Slazo was 16, and Che was 14, and therefore,

126
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,160
although we don't expect Slazo to be the perfect boyfriend, there is a level of responsibility on him.

127
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,040
Anyone with any amount of critical thinking could see that regardless of what he might be up to currently,

128
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,880
he deserves to face some retribution for his transgressions here as well, because it's clear he's done a lot of damage.

129
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:39,120
People aren't ignorant to moral repercussions, but this is also what confused me, I passed off at the time as Che

130
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,320
tried to sound reasonable, but rereading it, it just seemed rather discordant, and this is something that I

131
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,960
followed through into the second Twitlonger, because in response to Slazo's statement to Drama Alert,

132
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:54,480
alongside another Twitlonger statement, Che posted screenshots from Instagram from a conversation with Slazo

133
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,680
when he had heard that the first Twitlonger was in the works, these were claimed to incriminate Slazo further.

134
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,440
However, the main premise of these screenshots were, as Che stated, that Slazo appeared to deny none of the claims.

135
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,960
However, when reading this additional statement, I took immediate issue with this premise because there was no guarantee

136
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,280
that Slazo would have known the claims that Che would be making in her original Twitlonger,

137
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:20,240
as the Instagram conversation had occurred before it, so I found this rather strange.

138
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,120
With this in mind, the DMs themselves don't prove much, however, when you assess them more closely,

139
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,960
I'd argue they make Che look worse, mainly because there are multiple DMs in which Slazo seems to be

140
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,440
desperately asking for these people who have made these claims, and although I completely understand

141
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,520
why the anonymity of victims who haven't gone public yet needs to be protected, there was an evasiveness

142
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:47,120
about her answers that made me very uncomfortable. After numerous amounts of questions, and lack of answers,

143
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,920
Che changes the topic completely to the damage that he had caused, and it just felt dishonest,

144
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,120
because alright, if you say it publicly, I can see you're trying to present reasonability to the audience,

145
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,200
however there's no reason to say that in this conversation, it's just Slazo.

146
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,240
Who knows what he's done regardless, she had no reason to present reasonability, she could have just vented

147
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,800
that what he did was wrong, but the fact that she tried to play the I heard things about you card,

148
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,520
and then defaulting when Slazo tried to ask further, seemed very suspicious.

149
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,960
It felt disingenuous to me, which is what inspired me to reach out to Slazo, it felt like she knew

150
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:26,800
the nothing Slazo had done was as terrible as she framed it, and was trying to look for justification

151
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,840
to release these claims when it just wasn't there, while still exaggerating what happened.

152
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,240
And honestly, I didn't really want to speak to someone who had possibly done terrible things,

153
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,880
they provoke an emotional reaction from me and people know my personal history with it,

154
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,560
but it seemed like so many people had preemptively condemned him for something that just wasn't as it seemed,

155
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:53,600
and I felt he could use a bit of advice, after all, it was advice that would only work if he was truly innocent.

156
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,080
At the end of the day, if you're a popular creator, and you're publicly called out,

157
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:03,760
it is extremely important that you can defend yourself, these are allegations that will follow you around

158
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,480
because many people will look up your name, someone will recognise your face, it is a matter that extends

159
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,200
into your private life. Whether that defence takes a few days or a couple years sometimes,

160
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,280
these things will take some time to consolidate, just don't rush a statement, or don't try and cut something halfway,

161
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,880
or else people will just think you're trying to get away with it by downplaying it.

162
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,480
By promising that he'd be responding further but not saying too much, he didn't let people take his response apart,

163
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,000
and this gave him maximum scope for a full response.

164
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,360
I wanted to make a video regarding the situation, um, as of a couple weeks ago,

165
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,200
some of you might be wondering why it took so long to make this response.

166
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,240
I've spoken about the aesthetics of his response in a previous video, so I won't go in it too deep,

167
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,600
but there's a lot of points to be taken away, nonetheless relating specifically to the situations in question.

168
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,520
One thing that Slazo couldn't really dispute was the actual content of the DMs, however there was a lot he could dispute,

169
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,200
and we'll discuss how much the DM content was actually compromised.

170
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,880
But we'll look at the video for now. There are two separate things he could do,

171
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:12,000
firstly present a perspective that makes his story look legitimate, or go the extra mile and disprove the opposing perspective.

172
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,840
Although Che provided DMs, as noted they were much more to construct an image of a character that would imply he's capable of doing those acts,

173
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,640
there was no real evidence with direct reference.

174
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:28,560
So firstly, Slazo goes in for the anecdotal evidence, he doesn't directly contradict every story,

175
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,880
but he does manage to provide enough evidence to show that some of these stories aren't exactly as they were presented.

176
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:44,640
She pulls my hand down and says to touch her, which is a pretty long way from how she portrays it in her version of the story.

177
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,360
In fact, she was actually the one who brought up the entire idea of doing anything in the cinema.

178
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,200
It was her idea and I had no reason to believe she wasn't as in on this as I was.

179
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:03,600
But I do have plenty of evidence from very early on in the relationship where she clearly made no intention to wait until 16.

180
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,760
That was never clear to me, I never got that impression and I don't know why she's saying that.

181
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:14,400
She also mentions later in the post that she's never been in a relationship before, this isn't the impression that I was under.

182
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:21,200
I was under the impression from these screenshots here that she's had at least two boyfriends and one girlfriend before we ever met.

183
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:28,240
This is important because none of the stories were proven necessarily, so the fact that Slazo could at least provide contradiction for some of them

184
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,360
was enough to undermine a key factor necessary to Che's testimony, credibility.

185
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,200
On one hand, Slazo could have straight up denied these claims and left it there,

186
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,400
but the evidence he provided actually showed that Che had not presented these claims in good faith.

187
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,440
Probably the most incriminating factor was that the evidence that he provided was DM related,

188
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:54,160
and given the fact that Che clearly went through the DMs fairly meticulously to collect as much evidence against Slazo as possible,

189
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:00,000
it seems she must have avoided a lot of DMs that would show her as not being as helpless as she framed herself as.

190
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,480
Memories can be clouded and inaccurate, but the problem was the memory had become so biased that for many people,

191
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,280
whether Slazo intended to or not showed the claims as released in bad faith.

192
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:16,640
The same DMs that had incriminated Slazo a few weeks later had suddenly exonerated him.

193
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:24,640
But previous to these messages, I'd mentioned something, a complaint I had that I probably should have kept to myself,

194
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:32,400
it was... it's embarrassing for her, and she's saying that she wasn't too keen on doing that thing in the first place,

195
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:38,320
and now she's embarrassed. Anyway, around here she crops out around 11 minutes of conversation between us,

196
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,560
where I apologize and try to get her side and understand how she feels.

197
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,200
I wasn't very good at it, but I tried.

198
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,200
In the video where she's scrolling through her messages here to prove that they're real,

199
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:57,520
she also goes nearly up to where I apologize and try to understand her point of view, but then quickly scrolls down.

200
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:06,000
Ultimately, what made it look the worst for Che was the situation regarding the DMs.

201
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,160
This was arguably the most incriminating interaction that she had published,

202
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,480
yet she still withheld 10 minutes of conversation without any information.

203
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,200
This is content that could not have been merely missed.

204
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:23,440
This brought every claim into contention, and gave Slazo the chance to craft the image from his perspective,

205
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,320
and he knew that he messed up, so he owned up.

206
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:32,480
This put him in a position where he was able to apologize but simultaneously from a sympathetic position,

207
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,280
as the subject of a smear campaign in a way.

208
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,800
I think there's some legitimate criticism here, you know, something has happened,

209
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,680
and Slazo may have acted inappropriately, but we'll discuss the problems with this in a bit.

210
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,880
about that um she is is very much on board with it with the messages from the time where it actually

211
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,800
happened and the way she talks about it then is very different from the way she talks about it in

212
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:20,800
hindsight she also mentions me taking off her bra while she's crying firstly i would never do this

213
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:26,720
if i ever suspected that she didn't want any advance i was making i would stop and also the way

214
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,400
she talks about it in the messages from the time gives the impression that i i wasn't even

215
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,000
intentionally trying to take off her bra which i wasn't this situation by this point bothered me

216
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,440
a lot because allegations shouldn't be botched and they were here with the assumptions that the

217
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,000
allegations were purposely misleading which given what we've observed today would be hard to deny

218
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,880
it undermined any legitimate criticism that may have been warranted but also showed that this was

219
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,080
a situation best left private it was clear from both statements the parties involved had met up

220
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,960
and resolved this as people and although the idea that maybe one of them was manipulating the other

221
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,120
to think that it was all right seems to be a possibility it seems to me that both of these

222
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,680
people have been influenced by the distance placed between them i do have texts from the time that

223
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,720
proved the general tone it it felt very comfortable and i felt that she was completely fine with me by

224
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,520
this point i felt that her past was behind us and we were just putting the final nail in the coffin

225
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,480
by meeting up i really thought this was the case where she says how are you how are you feeling

226
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,880
about it all and i said it's nice it's like a weight's been lifted yeah it's great how are

227
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,120
you feeling about the stuff we talked about towards the end here she's referring to being

228
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,680
friends in the future and maybe getting back together at some point that's what this is

229
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:44,960
referring to oh like the future and stuff yeah um i feel the same as you really would be really nice

230
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,120
to be friends again for now obviously it's nothing definitive it's nothing concrete but there's that

231
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,280
so take whatever conclusion you will from that believe it or not i've been in a fair share of

232
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,560
drama and conflict in my time i have people who i haven't liked on a personal basis however meeting

233
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:06,080
them in person often reminds me that these people are mostly decent no one's perfect and if i thought

234
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,200
someone was then i'd probably be a bit more suspicious honestly flaws always exist sometimes

235
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,760
they're just a bit more well hidden than others and in spite of these flaws i can share many

236
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,200
positive experiences with a person even if i have bad memories with them too i wouldn't expect two

237
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,240
people like slather and che to ever be particularly close but it's important to remember how separation

238
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,200
might affect your judgment of a person it was clear that it reached a point that che was under

239
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,000
the impression that slather was a person deserving to suffer to the point where exaggeration was

240
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,560
considered fair game i guess the thing i'm most confused about in this whole thing is

241
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,520
why why would she lie why would she why would she say that she'd never been in a relationship before

242
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:54,400
never kissed before intended to wait until 16 and twist the truth of what happened in person and

243
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,400
make it and make out like she never wanted to do anything and this wasn't a two-way thing especially

244
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,000
at the beginning it it paints a very black and white picture of me being the predator and her

245
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:13,680
being the prey it cuts out all nuance of me not knowing what i'm doing and being an idiot which

246
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:18,240
obviously doesn't excuse what i've said and you know how i've made her feel but

247
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,840
it's a very condemning picture that she's painted and the things she said and the things that she's

248
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:32,240
implied that i've done can can very well follow me for life it's never fair game with all the

249
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,520
community backing she had falsifying claims that could be disproved with such unbelievably risky

250
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,080
business it wasn't a case of possible perspective with reasonable doubt it was a case where she

251
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,960
actively omitted content and expected that somehow that would help falsifying claims is

252
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,160
never a good idea in the instance that slazo is a predator well congratulations you've let a

253
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,960
predator get away and if he's not well that's terrible you just tried to end someone's career

254
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,000
over false allegations in the instagram conversation that che and i had before this all went live

255
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,520
which is now public record um she expresses concerns that i've been weird with other people

256
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,760
and that she's concerned i'll do it again um she doesn't specify who despite me asking a few times

257
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,480
and and she also says that she's concerned i have stan accounts and people who are probably willing

258
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,040
to send me things for my attention um i said that i've never taken advantage of this and

259
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:29,680
i even offered her my login to prove that i've never done this and wouldn't immediately after

260
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:35,600
offering my login the problem quickly becomes more that i didn't take responsibility and that i need

261
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:43,760
to suffer consequences for my actions um yeah the the reason for it going public quickly changes

262
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,560
and yes the whole twitlonger was released under the premise that he had been continuing this trend

263
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,360
of behavior but it just seems that he hasn't been no additional evidence has come forward suggesting

264
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,160
that he has and it seems strange if someone's prepared to allege that he's been continuing this

265
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,480
behavior as reason to come forward regarding this then that should be part of the evidence

266
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,480
if you're implying that publicizing your experience wouldn't be necessary if he wasn't

267
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,600
continuing this behavior then at that point with your own credibility in serious disrepute it would

268
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,840
be incumbent on these new people to come forward to imply that he might still be a threat but

269
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,080
unfortunately if they exist and they're not prepared to speak up and many people felt at

270
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,720
this point the original claims held no water whatsoever and with the release of slanzo's

271
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,920
video angry people flooded over to deal a torrent of criticism towards che but it was soon about to

272
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:39,680
be much bigger than her there had been discussion about the actual formulation of the twitlonger in

273
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,880
question because normally when someone makes claims you'd expect them to be the curator of

274
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,200
these comments however in this situation it seems like there were a few more people involved this

275
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,800
was implied when a couple people commented that they'd been involved but this didn't come under

276
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,920
the microscope until after slazo's response after slazo's response many felt like he had made a

277
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,160
compelling case for himself and people felt that providing the situation remained as it was that

278
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,160
he was entitled to an apology or at least a retraction from those who supported the original

279
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,880
twitlonger i don't think people had a particularly high bar because those who had endorsed one opinion

280
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,440
shouldn't remain supporting that opinion if they now see it as false in case new fans come along

281
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,440
and receive a false impression an apology or attraction is one of the ways that this can be

282
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,920
resolved however to many people surprised a few creators involved decided that actually they

283
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:26,720
didn't want to apologize to slazo initially the people who put out public statements were quite

284
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,440
blues dank dolan dark westerner i'm alex and king annie although these responses were different

285
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,480
shades of tone many found these responses inadequate or misleading some of these responses

286
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,880
are not worth talking about such as quites because he just said he wanted to wait for more information

287
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,080
which is completely fair however there were a few that did strike me as slightly off well first take

288
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,200
a look at king annie someone who i have met and found thoroughly pleasant however the situation

289
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,920
didn't do so great for her firstly she had this monumental take that quotes innocent people don't

290
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,240
stay quiet for this long a day before slazo released his response and then in response to

291
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,840
slazo's video decided to say this a lot of people were pretty focused on alex's take which we will

292
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,240
discuss later but i do think this one is significantly worse michael is still guilty for

293
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,760
what he did in the past yes we are all guilty for what we've done in the past the question was

294
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,120
what exactly happened he did admit to some things most notably a quote complaint he had but it

295
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,360
would be incumbent on the people involved to try and exactly pinpoint what the context for

296
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,680
this situation is because he said himself that he didn't want to mention it specifically

297
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:34,800
so you have the chance to clarify what this actually was and you didn't no one is glossing

298
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:40,000
over it it's just people can't go after him until they know the specific context until then people

299
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,040
will be looking towards you for elaboration and then we have this gaslighting comment which i

300
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,680
found rather strange gaslighting is when you make a person doubt their own experiences through

301
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,320
manipulation but i don't think she knows what that means also i find it strange that her language

302
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,880
implies the fact that she can label this as gaslighting suddenly means it's manipulation

303
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,760
and not just manipulation on its own terms it's a strange way to express your position it's like

304
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,280
she thinks that people just identify the word manipulation rather than the underlying processes

305
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,600
people aren't the smartest sometimes but they're a bit smarter than that then she goes for the

306
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,400
mentality argument and yes there was a responsibility on slazo that he failed as a

307
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,200
boyfriend there was an age gap frankly put more weight on him but the problem was that it seemed

308
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,520
that they were both ignorant in a way that would make their judgment poor other factors like

309
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:33,120
experience also have to be taken into account secondly that's not how i remember it is not a

310
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,400
shit rebuttal at all without the evidence sometimes it's the only rebuttal and it's the only way people

311
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,760
can defend themselves when they have unsubstantiated claims made against them they cannot directly

312
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,080
disprove then we have the final statement that annie makes which brings it back to this notion

313
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,120
mistakes and it's okay if you want to stand by your friend i completely understand that

314
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,920
that's your choice but these aren't mistakes example in the original twitlonger che states

315
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,480
that this was her first relationship in an attempt to make her perspective seem more innocent this is

316
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,720
not a passive omission this is not something that she could forget it is an active lie that

317
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,760
was contradicted by slazo in his response these mistakes are all over the twitlonger and you can

318
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,240
stick up for a character in public but you should have a very stern talking to her in private because

319
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,320
given the twitlonger have been in the works for around a month and you took credit for helping

320
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,960
her you really should have made sure there wasn't room for such mistakes she ends by saying she

321
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,680
hopes he can get some therapy issues that as he has presented the argument seem to be resolved

322
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,400
as said i met annie after the statement and she completely defined my expectations i really

323
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,200
enjoyed her company and she may genuinely believe this but if she does then i'd really recommend

324
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,200
withholding judgment of situations in the future not because she's a friend but because she's a

325
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,960
public figure and that sort of exercise of power is obviously going to have a huge influence on

326
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,200
someone's judgments plenty of people have spoken to me and said that they think che was manipulated

327
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,280
and i think that's very possible too even unintentionally the sort of pressure from

328
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:02,160
such powerful figures to put a statement out would be crushing chase twitlonger is not the

329
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:07,040
sort of thing that people can continue backing even if it's just for the sake of personal pride

330
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:13,120
even if you want to continue backing che as a person even if you don't like slazo even if you

331
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,960
find him creepy there's such a dynamic of power in this situation that shouldn't have been used

332
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,520
wiesner was the other person who made noteworthy comments in response to this situation and

333
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,160
honestly when breaking his comments down they're not that different to annie's okay so i just

334
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:34,080
watched slazo's video his response to his ex-girlfriend che's accusation that he was

335
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:40,720
uh emotionally and perhaps even sexually abusive and my conclusion is that he is just gonna have

336
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,680
to learn from his mistakes i mean he fucked up it looks like he's still gonna fuck up again

337
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,840
he gives me a lot of impressions that he's definitely manipulator he even owns up to it in

338
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,960
his video he definitely seems like the person to to gaslight his partner make them think that

339
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,800
things happen differently from what they remember in order to manipulate them and make them

340
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:05,520
apologize for something that wasn't even their fault um i don't want to believe that che is just

341
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:13,760
an outright liar but there was this one clip that always stuck out to me slazo did admit that he was

342
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:19,600
controlling he used the word controlling he didn't say manipulative now all the youtubers are

343
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:25,120
manipulative that's how we got to where we are we manipulate an audience day to day for money i mean

344
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,840
like this is what we do i know it has a negative connotation to it but it just is what it is this

345
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,360
was not a good thing to say firstly equivocating being controlling and being manipulative and then

346
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,360
equivocating being manipulative in the past tense and being manipulative in the present tense

347
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:47,920
we made two huge logical jumps to justify a point of view that we cannot be remotely sure of at all

348
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,640
to be honest i think his statement wasn't the worst even though he made that stupid comment

349
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,880
about people being manipulative because he did seem to acknowledge that a lot of the information

350
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,200
was wrong and it should have remained private but his opinion still just seems to be parroting

351
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,520
other people without knowing what those words actually mean it seems like a lot of people

352
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:11,040
involved were just trying to make what he admitted appear worse than what he actually did without

353
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:16,400
proving it was a lot worse despite having the opportunity and people saw through it and people

354
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:23,840
were asking for more and well they got more but not exactly in the way they'd hope all right i'm

355
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,200
gonna head to the con in a second of sunburn madam's apple look like a lobster

356
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,560
i'm in a lot of pain we go again see you all soon

357
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,640
the problem is that when people started making statements like these people saw it as them

358
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,520
trying to cover their backsides and for justified reasons the people involved all knew che and if

359
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,600
che had more evidence that she was prepared to release other people involved were either better

360
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,520
off staying silent or at least informing the audience that there would be more evidence to

361
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,880
come however they spoke as if this was it at least for now and people picked up on that one

362
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,920
of the most confusing things for me as a viewer was that people who had openly reacted with such

363
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,560
shock and surprise when these allegations were first released when many of these claims were

364
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,680
counted or disproved suddenly changed their tune as if they knew he was a terrible person anyway

365
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,840
and the fact that the claims were falsified oh that doesn't matter as someone who might be a

366
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,720
friend to someone like slazo as someone who was not present in the original relationship as

367
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,240
someone who felt the shock and surprised i'd be relieved when he put out his response but this

368
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,680
was the sort of response that makes people think there's another motive something else behind it

369
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:42,000
i'm alex was another person who honestly i didn't expect to be involved and i really wish he wasn't

370
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,240
i've known him for ages and he's been having a rough time recently so i don't want to give him

371
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,880
grief he has apologized since but it would be dishonest for me to pretend he doesn't exist

372
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,880
he was one of the people who decided that the public deserved a response and whether they did

373
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:01,120
or not it probably wasn't the one that alex should have provided hello guys um i i want to try and

374
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,400
put this in as concise way as possible uh but this is my response to michael and slazo's video

375
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,800
uh there's a limit on this so if i'm brushing other things i'm trying not to i just want to

376
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:17,120
put everything in here in a place that is easy for people to get to um i want to make a statement

377
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,920
because of the fact that obviously i came out and supported che when she posted her to it longer

378
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:27,840
um and obviously now michael's video has come out where he's debunked um some of the things

379
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,400
that were put in there my problem with michael was him admitting to doing things that he knew

380
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:37,760
che may not have wanted to do and being incredibly forceful and almost demanding which he admitted

381
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,960
to doing in his video which for me is still disgusting um i don't believe he's innocent

382
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,320
i i don't think he's innocent at all uh che may not also be innocent and i may have hid stuff and

383
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,840
and used jokes to try and maybe push a certain agenda but at the same time the stuff that michael

384
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,600
admitted to is stuff that makes me not want to be friends with somebody who is capable of doing

385
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,640
those things once again it felt like he'd read a tldr of the video and attempted to derive some

386
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,840
conclusions from there it wasn't a good response and admittedly it did confuse me to an extent

387
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,440
i'm alex has been covering youtube drama for ages and surely he'd know the do's and don'ts responses

388
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,600
in an ideal scenario if there was no more information the best thing to do is to say

389
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,000
that you were misled and apologize you don't have to be friends with the person you don't even have

390
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,040
to believe that they're a good person but you have to say what you got wrong alex spoke like someone

391
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:32,480
who knew more information was preparing for more information yet as mentioned earlier if there was

392
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,280
more information the best thing would be just say nothing at all or to tell people to hold their

393
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:42,480
horses on the other hand i thought there must be more to this because someone wouldn't pick such an

394
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,640
obviously bad response when they've been covering responses since the dawn of time but even then

395
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,040
putting out an awful response receiving a little backlash only to wait a few weeks and suddenly

396
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,520
drop some evidence that will turn the case on its head is a terrible way to go about it as well

397
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:02,240
because people will just be pissed off and ask why on earth you didn't just say there's more to come

398
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,840
this gives me the impression that no one was actually certain of additional evidence to be

399
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,840
released but was hopeful that there would be some killer response that would make their critics look

400
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:15,600
like idiots sexual misconduct allegations aren't about the gotcha moments with all this in mind i

401
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,400
put out a tweet venting my frustration about the handling of the situation and in light of this

402
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,720
some people involved reached out to me in private regarding the claims but what they said is there

403
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,120
would be a lot more additional evidence and claimants with a high level of certainty this

404
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,440
caused me a lot of confusion because as aforementioned with their current statements

405
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,880
people involved were about to receive a lot of criticism but who was the main recipient of the

406
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:43,840
sites of the ravenous commentator our friend alex people were not happy about his response in

407
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:49,440
particular but why well as noted earlier he is a commentator who is renowned for his takes on

408
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,240
youtube drama in fact many people view him as one of the most credible commentators in the community

409
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:59,040
and therefore his fumbling was a huge stain on his takes this was brought forward in tandem with

410
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,440
his james charles take which many people criticized him about honestly i thought his

411
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,760
original video was a fairly natural reaction to a situation that seemed pretty different to the

412
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,840
truth and to be fair he did actually apologize for that take although some people felt that

413
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:16,080
his original video should have been removed and that was a justified position too that i agree

414
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,800
with these back-to-back situations someone who people seem to have much higher standards for

415
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,040
made the criticism a lot more stinging on top of this there are people who have some pretty

416
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,360
personal grudges against him two of those creators being kavos and keemstar the kavos

417
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:34,160
feud has been a long personal conflict originating way back from when kavos made a video on wild

418
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,680
spartans i'm alex's then friend a while later i'm alex then clapped back with a video of his own

419
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:45,440
which kavos replied to when keemstar shafted kavos over a dispute regarding drama channels i'm alex

420
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,080
actually intervened and defended kavos which seemed to put the conflict to rest with kavos

421
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:54,320
even suggesting that he was happy that alex's channel was doing well however this will fall

422
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,080
apart when both the creators appeared to intend to meet each other but never did

423
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,160
with alex claiming that he tried to meet him multiple times and kavos saying that this just

424
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,600
wasn't true this new situation gave kavos a whole new round of ammunition to take aim at alex with

425
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:14,160
the backing of keemstar what he's done i think we can all agree is just inexcusable and there

426
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,360
needs to be some sort of consequence for that you can't just go around doing this be a commentary

427
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,040
youtube over 1.6 million subs and do that how can anyone trust him again how can he have any

428
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,240
credibility that is what you need as a commentator how can he be a commentator after all of that

429
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,600
keemstar on the other hand has hated alex fairly consistently for a long time from a situation

430
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:40,720
rooting back to keemstar's beta podcast a podcast featuring keem fellow british commentator

431
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,160
colossal is crazy and drama streamer tommy c after a conversation alex reported that keemstar

432
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,480
was the instigating factor for its demise he made a twitter video when he knew clown

433
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,920
couldn't defend himself accusing him of asking for more money and accusing clown of refusing

434
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,880
to cooperate when in all reality it was king keemstar since claimed that alex is a social

435
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,480
climber who will only use people for his opportunistic game last night you said the

436
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:14,240
reason why i don't like you is because you don't like me that's that's retarded you're actually

437
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,560
retarded look dude the reason why i don't like you is because you uploaded a video and you made

438
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:26,160
up a bunch of lives about me that was the start of it um then you kept doing this repeatedly then

439
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,720
you started fucking leeching off people and using them to kind of get where you were ironically this

440
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,840
situation spurred members of the community on so much that keemstar and tommy c long opposed to

441
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,160
each other put their differences aside and reunited with colossal to record an episode

442
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,520
of the baited podcast relating specifically to this situation if the community all starts hating

443
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:51,040
pewdiepie one day he would hate pewdiepie right if the community starts loving pewdiepie he loves

444
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:58,400
pewdiepie like dude this guy is a flip-flopping piece of i hate him he's not a real person he's

445
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,280
not a real person with real opinions and real thoughts boogie does the same thing always goes

446
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,640
with the popular vote and he'll retract his opinion in a heartbeat well his heart beats

447
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,840
pretty fucking fast to be honest with the clear evidence that there was some fuel in the tank

448
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:18,720
other smaller creators jumped on the opportunity to upload videos on i'm alex claiming either his

449
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,840
disloyalty to slazo or his hypocrisy regarding situations the reason he had become the target

450
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:28,400
was mostly circumstantial nothing he'd done at this stage was different to many other creators

451
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,400
and i was concerned that people would forget about the greater points that were to be made

452
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,440
my concerns were confirmed when alex unwisely decided to speak to some of these smaller creators

453
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,600
in a private call which would honestly not remain private for long he allegedly disclosed

454
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,400
multiple details regarding the situation these creators then decided that they would do what

455
00:38:46,400 --> 00:39:03,840
they know best talk about it and oh dear oh dear oh dear in this call it is alleged that all sorts

456
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:08,800
of information was divulged the prime recipient of this information was a youtuber slash streamer

457
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,760
named nicholas diorio who then went and passed on alex's numerous comments to various creators

458
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,840
some who were directly referenced and others for video purposes i have no clue why alex thought

459
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,840
this was a good idea but it wasn't people are always nicer in conversation than when they're

460
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,840
publicly talking about you and it seems that alex was under the impression that if he told them

461
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,880
aside they'd be a bit softer on him in public unfortunately that was not the case diorio took

462
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,440
alex's comments regarding slazo straight to slazo and conducted an interview in which he asked

463
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,880
slazo his opinions on these takes alex claims that you had been rough and forceful with a girl

464
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,280
while staying with him he claimed you were completely sober and forcefully getting this

465
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,640
woman drunk allegedly alex had to step in and remove the girl from the situation as you begun

466
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:58,080
kissing and sent her home in an uber alex also claimed he told you we don't do that shit around

467
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:06,640
here man and bullied you for the next few days yes um yeah this was really confusing to hear

468
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:14,240
honestly um this is a complete um embellishment of what happened he also took comments about

469
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,640
other people to the parties mentioned and informed them too we'll return to this point later but it

470
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,680
was basically the release of a pandora's box of information into the community and provided plenty

471
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,400
more content for creators to nor on one of these creators was turkey tom who for legal reasons i

472
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,680
must disclose isn't actually a turkey and why is your name turkey tom but you're not a turkey

473
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,240
all right if you really wanted to pull this off and brand it right you'd be a fucking turkey

474
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,720
he was making a video on the slazo situation covering the various responses and one of the

475
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,040
people who had been regularly mentioned in private but not so much in public was a creator by the

476
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,920
name of hyojin it was claimed that among other things alex had implied various facts about hyojin

477
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,000
in a call with oreo which were then publicized subsequently although i cannot confirm whether

478
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,840
alex actually said this many people seem to believe that he did given their own personal

479
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:04,640
relationships with him and some even publicly reacted with hostility when a certain situation

480
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,360
that we'll talk about later transpired these claims also seem to be unsubstantiated and many

481
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:14,160
others involved said they simply weren't true hyojin is a creator slash artist who is closely

482
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,640
associated with che she hasn't been too vocal about the situation however have been involved

483
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,560
in assisting the release of the twitlong behind the scenes she was named and saved and what

484
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,120
happens when a creator is called out is that often people like to go one step further and see what

485
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:31,920
other shady behavior they may be partaking in when hyojin's name was dragged out under the sun

486
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,920
a lot followed a lot of offensive dms a lot of testimonies from people who had negative experiences

487
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,560
and some further rumors some of this stuff was definitely warranting criticism for example an

488
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,440
nsfw blog in which she posted explicit art of people from within the community some of these

489
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,160
people were quite underage and others definitely didn't consent to it however other claims were

490
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,440
slightly more shaky and also rather invasive in a person's private life so where does turkey tom

491
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,840
come into this well he uploaded a video on the situation in which he addresses the involvement

492
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:06,400
of many individuals and one of them is hyojin this was not too long after the information of

493
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,440
her involvement had been floated from the private call besides the multiple other allegations

494
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,560
regarding her behavior in tom's video he made some very fair points that would deserve criticism for

495
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:21,040
the parties involved however when going through hyojin's involvement although mostly focusing

496
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,840
on the content that was fairly verifiable he divulged two pieces of psa that were probably

497
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,840
rather inappropriate the first was a rumor regarding an affair that should not have gone

498
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:34,560
in a public video and the second was a set of allegations regarding animal maltreatment

499
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:39,200
relating back to the claim by an anonymous source that she was not just unpleasant but had a habit

500
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,960
of picking up a dog and placing it on its back now i cannot comment on the verifiability of these

501
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,920
claims but the problem was the second claim was so outlandish and ridiculous that it immediately

502
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,800
caught the most attention despite arguably being the least relevant now normally with such a claim

503
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,840
we would think about it critically innocent until proven guilty however people were so caught up in

504
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:04,480
the sentiment of criticizing kyojin that it was just lumped in there with all the actual other

505
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,040
legitimate criticism and because it is arguably the strangest claim it became the claim that was

506
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:14,560
referenced the most and ultimately became a focus alongside the already existent criticism of her

507
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:19,200
content in the situation it finally provoked a response from her however these responses were

508
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,920
not well received because they weren't very good and people continue to lump pressure onto her

509
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,560
creators made additional videos turkey tom made a second video in which he responded to heojin's

510
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:33,120
comments and provided further elaboration to his points and although there was still attention on

511
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:38,400
other people involved it's clear that a lot was said about heojin and she became a very easy

512
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,440
target due to her incompetence in dealing with this however it's clear that people had become

513
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,160
too carried away on the basis of some shaky criticism and some character and it was easy

514
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:53,680
to witness ultimately the sort of mob had turned on heojin and it was becoming very toxic and after

515
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:58,400
a few days she blacked out her twitter and it was reported she'd attempted to take her own life

516
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,200
fortunately she survived and was hospitalized however this provoked a lot of further conflict

517
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,920
from within the community at first there was an immediate reaction an outpouring of support in the

518
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,440
hashtag love for heojin movement trying to reverse what it had become but soon enough people began

519
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,520
to make more provocative statements maybe people began to turn on those who had rustled up this

520
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,480
scenario stating that they were partly accountable for this terrible situation however in response

521
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,720
to this many of the lead critics asked if the attempt really changed any of the points that

522
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,640
were being made against her it's a tough discussion because both of these points are

523
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,440
extremely sensitive but neither of them are entirely invalid if someone did something

524
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,000
terrible and attempted on their life no it does not change the terrible thing they did

525
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,720
but i also think the point of criticism is to improve someone not drive them off the edge

526
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,520
and mixing in unsubstantiated rumors in there just generally harmed the case that could have

527
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:55,040
been much more focused on what actually happened and not drive someone's image down as some sort

528
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:00,000
of dog tipper it's why we should always make our criticism as clear as possible from a personal

529
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,680
perspective we will always provoke some backlash onto a person if we criticize them however firstly

530
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:10,160
we want to make sure that we don't cause harassment and secondly we don't want to provide

531
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,880
backlash on the basis of false information nonetheless that does not mean that harassment

532
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,360
is accountable to the original critic because there will always be some people who look for

533
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:24,480
an excuse to harass people regardless and there has to be some level of personal responsibility

534
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,160
for such behavior in this situation i don't think anyone maliciously intended to provoke harassment

535
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:35,120
nor do i think anyone can singly be blamed for reporting on a lot of this but going in with

536
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:39,520
outlandish rumors at a time where people saw a lot of the claims as flying regardless of whether

537
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:44,320
they had wings or not was probably not the best shout try and make sure that what you're basing

538
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:48,960
your content off is as well founded as they come it doesn't just help the person you may be

539
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:54,000
criticizing but it helps your case too and prevents this sort of situation coming back today

540
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,960
to tom's credit he has actually made changes to his videos that remove the unsubstantiated claims

541
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,240
and anyone who also did that should receive their fair credit it's an emotional situation and people

542
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,120
do feel really strongly about it i respect that when people made their videos i don't think it

543
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:14,480
came from a place of ha ha drama let's cash in i genuinely think this mattered to people because

544
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,840
people did feel strongly about being in a position where you would be exposed for something that you

545
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:25,760
didn't do and you could have your whole career ruined that provoked strong feelings understandably

546
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:31,200
so however although this was the situation that brought the drama to a halt it was still a very

547
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:37,120
small part of a very complex puzzle because there were still so many unanswered questions regarding

548
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:42,320
how and why this happened and what exactly was going on behind the scenes and that's what i want

549
00:46:42,320 --> 00:47:00,080
to discuss now why is arguably the most important question that one can ask because once you find

550
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:04,640
the underlying roots of a scenario then you might be able to exactly understand the cause for these

551
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:10,080
situations and hopefully work on avoiding them in the future that's important for anyone involved

552
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:14,480
at the end of the day the goal is to make sure that anyone who is a threat to those around them

553
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,760
is addressed properly and innocent parties are left alone so that we can elevate victims and

554
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,560
make sure that they have a voice there are many reasons that people have hypothesized how this

555
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:29,280
has happened one of the more popular theories is that of competition and although it would be

556
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,240
certainly an interesting albeit sinister twist i don't think that is the case i don't think those

557
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,720
creators were threatened by the prospect of another creator covering a similar genre and

558
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:43,520
slazo wasn't a similar genre to many of the creators involved anyway it would certainly

559
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:49,440
take a very elaborate plan to take out someone for the mere reason of being competition i also

560
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,480
don't think it's a group conspiracy i don't think that everyone involved in the release of the

561
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,120
statement had malintent it seems plausible that one or two people color the perception of the

562
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:06,480
party but it seems unlikely that we'll be able to work out exactly who in light of the situation

563
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,760
we've seen a few party members involved openly apologize their involvement this seems like the

564
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,720
right thing to do at this point however it still doesn't really answer why a couple people doubled

565
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,720
down at the time some have stated that they thought they'd heard more stories but it just

566
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,880
seems confusing that if the first claims were disproved they'd stand by these additional

567
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,920
claims and openly call out slazo if they were unsubstantiated which is what they seem like

568
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,640
on top of this a fair few people still defend che's intentions or say that they thought she

569
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:39,520
genuinely didn't have the idea of leaving out all this evidence and once again although someone may

570
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:45,280
be genuinely hurt it really can't excuse what happened it really can't change the fact that she

571
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,160
would have had to have gone through all these messages and she didn't just accidentally miss

572
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:56,800
out 10 minutes of dms it's impossible to really work around it doesn't really excuse what happened

573
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:02,160
and doesn't really make sense either the fact that someone just accidentally left out 10 minutes of

574
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:07,840
conversation i can't look inside their soul and completely deduce what was going on which made

575
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:13,280
so many people desperate to justify that slazo wasn't a good person but given the similarity

576
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:18,400
of all the responses and the general misuse of terminology it seems like it was just a case of

577
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,280
group think with some people's ignorance taken advantage of by a less than well-meaning actor

578
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,480
perhaps but that's just a theory some people haven't commented further that will be for better

579
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,360
or for worse some people have like westner i love you i don't understand priming's video

580
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:38,080
makes you sound evil uh yeah it's just some fucking guy some fucking content content vulture

581
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:43,920
this is yeah i mean what do you expect making video about the drama like a month after it

582
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,720
happens quick point buddy primink isn't a content vulture he's a guy who cares a lot about a

583
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:53,200
situation that you claim to care about too and the fact that you have the nerve to judge people's

584
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,360
character on the basis of them calling out is pretty rotten if you don't feel like there's

585
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:01,920
anything more to say then don't say anything more there were also some people claiming that

586
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:07,120
people at the actual insomnia event knew which i can't say i agree with either even if people were

587
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:12,000
unsure at the time i don't think they would have invited him over with that knowledge with that

588
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,240
said there were definitely people who have known for a while who were not at the event and that

589
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:21,600
does bother me because no one thought to tell me or many other people what was going on people know

590
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:26,480
that there are people there with strong history with sexual misconduct and even when i was told

591
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:31,680
personally i was still not meant to know and even then if he was a threat people really sat

592
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:36,320
on this evidence for such an exceptionally long time as if he wasn't going out and about in his

593
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:42,000
daily life interacting with multiple females it all felt so fine-tuned it was more designed to be

594
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,640
a spectacle than an actual post and that's what bothered a lot of people myself included in my

595
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,120
opinion there have been people trying to get individuals to disassociate from slazo due to

596
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:55,600
how they perceived his behavior and it reached a person who insisted that they needed to go public

597
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:00,560
with this information but unfortunately it just wasn't there and you know i do believe that people

598
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:05,760
act with earnest intent when trying to bring these things to light i will defend many of those people

599
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:11,120
but the fact is that it took a month to come out with a much less than adequate allegations

600
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:16,960
embellished with evidence that had clearly not been closely looked at i mean it's infuriating

601
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,280
and it has taken its toll plenty of people have lost subscribers plenty of people haven't been

602
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,760
doing mentally well out of all the drama watching this one was probably the most painful but i felt

603
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:30,320
it was worth saying something because as someone who saw a lot of it going on in the inside it took

604
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:35,040
a toll not just on the people directly involved but on a lot of the people around and the

605
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,920
relationships they had i've now heard multiple contradicting statements from people involved

606
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:45,040
which don't add up people who i believe i could trust i heard them out i believed them and

607
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:50,800
supported them but since then i've had to take a step back and ask myself who i put my faith in

608
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,440
it's draining it makes me miserable and i'll always stand up for the people who are my friends

609
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,160
if anyone asks me about the intentions of people involved i defend them to the bitter end but there

610
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,080
are some things that never sat right with me throughout this all and nothing has really

611
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:08,880
righted those feelings of discontent there were people who did not treat those around them like

612
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,520
friends a lot of youtubers should look at the slazo situation and take a long hard look at

613
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:18,240
themselves and the way they treat their friends as for slazo well i want to take a brief moment

614
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,720
to critique him independently it's clear he's had some problems but i don't think those problems

615
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:27,040
are problems that he's not been working on and it's clear he acknowledged that he's behaved as

616
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:32,160
a bad boyfriend in many ways being controlling is a poor show and there are definitely certain

617
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,720
things that he has admitted to that would be worthy of criticism floating the idea that his

618
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:41,840
girlfriend should take different antidepressants that would aid her sex drive like she said the

619
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:48,240
thing i didn't go there when she was on a period i suggested at one point that she go off her

620
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:54,560
antidepressant well i suggested she'd go to another one but at other points i insinuated

621
00:52:54,560 --> 00:53:02,480
that it might be a bad thing that she was on these antidepressants why first her sex drive

622
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:09,200
yeah like she said oh two so your intention was to amplify it or to decrease it to em to

623
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:14,560
yeah to amplify it yeah all right that's that's the point against you i would say

624
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:19,040
it was exceptionally inappropriate and we don't know the context of this he may have just

625
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:24,000
suggested it one time passing or it may have been a more coercive problem but he's been given a

626
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,280
chance to address himself in this situation and i am pleased with that he has the chance to improve

627
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:34,880
himself and work on his image i do not believe he's a bad person though that's just my opinion

628
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:39,840
and i may have been duped the slazo may not be the change man that i view him as now and i'll

629
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:45,600
have to hold my hands up and that's okay because we get things wrong sometimes i've got things

630
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:50,800
wrong i'm probably gonna get things wrong again we can't expect to get everything completely right

631
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:56,080
but if we end up in a situation that is so much bigger than us where a person's career might rely

632
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:01,120
on our own conduct then we need to hold our hands up and if there's more to come then just let

633
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:05,680
people know if you think that holding off information and surprise releasing it in bits

634
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:11,760
is gonna own your critics you are really wrong allegations are not film sequels although i have

635
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:16,000
spoken about my involvement in this it would be unfair to not note the work of the many people

636
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,560
who did provide slazo with the support when certain creators continued to turn on him in

637
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:25,680
spite of his rather conclusive response with what we know i do believe they did the right thing and

638
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:30,240
provided substantial criticism to names who would have otherwise gone unchecked and i must give them

639
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:35,920
their due credit to finish i definitely urge people to take a bit more of a careful response

640
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,840
to allegations in the future there's nothing wrong with throwing your weight behind and taking a

641
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:44,240
stand and making creators address these things at the end of the day i do believe it's their

642
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:48,960
responsibility but definitely don't go on a clowning stampede the main goal should be to

643
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,840
have people address it and if they can't they've messed up then we can enact what we view as a

644
00:54:53,840 --> 00:55:00,000
proportional response justice is a responsibility incumbent on the community creators and audiences

645
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:05,600
it's a shame that it was misused in this instance but hopefully it's at a close now and we can all

646
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:16,880
move forward so yes that's the video i hope you enjoyed it was definitely a difficult one to

647
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,640
write but we got there in the end i really want to give a big shout out to the editors who once
