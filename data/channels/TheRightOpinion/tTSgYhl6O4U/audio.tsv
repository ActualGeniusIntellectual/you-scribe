0	21680	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
21680	26640	too much free time. And my oh my, do we have a topic on our hands today. I know this is
26640	30440	late but honestly it's a subject that has taken made twists and turns, that it was worth
30440	35260	waiting just in case any final revelations were brought forward, and obviously this video
35260	38960	does not exempt the fact that there may be further twists and turns in the case, and
38960	43380	also does not mean that any new unrelated information may compromise the character of
43380	49040	those involved. So let's talk about gaming festivals, who loves them? I mean honestly
49040	54160	I think gaming festivals would be really swell if there were less people, or no people even,
54160	58760	because I do like video games but I don't like having to wait to play them, often I just find myself
58760	62640	aimlessly wandering and occasionally bumping into people who I may have seen at previous
62640	67000	events and retaking the same photo, just this time with a slightly greater inkling of fatigue
67000	71160	reflected in my weary smile. The pinball machines are good though, especially when you don't
71160	75680	have to pave them, hooray for free things. Anyhow, the gaming festival that is of interest
75680	81920	is Insomnia Gaming Festival 64, abbreviated to i64, this ran from the Easter weekend from
81920	86840	the 19th to the 22nd of April, I saw a lot of close friends again, and met a lot of great
86840	91560	creators. It's always nice to do so, because it humanises all these people, and puts the
91560	96000	internet into perspective. One of these people I met at the event was a bloke called Michael,
96000	100800	known online as Slazo, he was pleasant, I had some facetious flirtatious exchanges with
100800	105200	him, and after the event my life carried on, I knew some of the creators that I had met
105200	109600	there were going to London afterwards, Slazo included, and I would have joined them, but
109600	114480	alas, I had university to complete, and I still felt that YouTube was an unstable source
114480	119400	of income, so I wanted something to fall back onto in case everything fell apart. A few
119400	124400	weeks later, around mid-May, I was alternating between university work and checking my social
124400	129220	blade when one of my acquaintances messaged me quite shocking news, apparently Slazo,
129220	134240	the person who I'd met at i64, was going to be exposed, as a predator, he was just
134240	138140	as surprised as I was, apparently these claims were going to be published on a twitlonger
138140	143180	in the following week. So I waited with anticipation, as I hadn't actually seen any of the evidence,
143180	146620	I didn't really talk to anyone about it, although I did tell one of my friends who
146620	151800	was making a documentary about i64 to perhaps consider excluding any footage with him in,
151800	156940	in case it might taint the finished product, more as an act of caution really. So I waited,
156940	162580	and waited, and waited. A month later a twitlonger was published by a person named Fizzypop,
162580	167240	who goes by the name of Che, it documented the allegations against Slazo, these allegations
167240	171640	painted him as a sex-hungry predator who exploited the innocence and inexperience
171640	176400	of a younger individual in the relationship, aggressively obtaining gratification when
176400	180600	she didn't want to offer it. This was met with immediate support from the community,
180600	184840	including many large youtubers, it was clearly a very emotional topic for many people and
184840	189460	many wanted to show their support for a victim. Alongside the twitlonger, there was a substantial
189460	194300	amount of screenshots that appeared to provide irrefutable evidence that Slazo was behaving
194300	198380	in just this fashion, including multiple allusions to sexual assault which seemed to
198380	203300	corroborate her testimony. I may naturally hesitant person however, so I decided to wait
203300	207740	a bit more. Obviously I didn't really blame anyone who wanted to show their support because
207740	212800	many of them are clearly invested, and many people behind the scenes may have information
212800	217300	that I may not be privy to, and the screenshots themselves were undoubtedly compelling. It
217300	221900	was a few days later that DramaAlert reported on the situation, with a screenshot of Slazo's
221900	226380	initial statement. It was nothing too revealing, said some of the claims were false or exceptionally
226380	230400	misleading, and understandably said that he would be working on a reply that would take
230400	234600	a little more time. He also said that he was caught off guard by these claims as he had
234600	239980	met Che since the relationship and supposedly put it all behind them. My judgement was skeptical
239980	243520	of his statement at this point, but if he was prepared to reply then I expected him
243520	247920	to have something at least. However then Fizzy Pop decided to release an additional response
247920	252520	to Slazo's statement. It is stated that they had a conversation on Instagram in which Slazo
252520	256880	did not deny any of the claims that she made, thus incriminating him further. Many people
256880	261400	once again stood behind these claims and supported Che with what she was saying, no one with
261400	265880	any decent amount of common sense was going to instigate grief onto a possible victim
265880	270460	of sexual predation. However, behind the scenes something didn't sit right with me, I already
270460	274400	mentioned this in a previous video and I'll go into more depth later, but looking at the
274400	278780	conversation something about the tone of Che just made me uncomfortable, so I confronted
278780	283160	Slazo and told him that, although he's deserving of some very genuine criticism, if it had
283160	287360	been taken out of context like he claimed, in spite of the risk, it would be worth showing
287360	291940	the additional content because the importance of protecting your social image is vital.
291940	295160	These are things that will stick with someone for life, and if she has shown what would
295160	299380	frame you as terrible, if you say you want to show evidence but then don't, people will
299380	304580	take that, well as it seems, incriminating. Our conversation ended and I waited for his
304580	309460	video, and on the evening of June 27th he finally responded, it was a strong video,
309460	313860	I had to watch it a few times through, and once again I'll save my thoughts for later
313860	317840	on. Although I was pleased he had managed to present his side, I was also anticipating
317840	322500	possible additional responses, as said, at this point in time it felt like a situation
322500	327040	that was mostly between him and Che, although it had caught my attention that certain people
327040	331140	had openly taken credit when the initial statement came out, I assumed that their involvement
331140	335340	would be addressed when we had assessed the validity of the claims. However, what quickly
335340	339600	happened was a descent into community civil war, many people who had been involved in
339600	343800	the release of the original statement decided to tweet out further comments, many of these
343800	348240	people decided to continue backing Che, however, many of their statements were vague and also
348240	354100	frustrated many audiences. This led to pressure on creators to hashtag apologize to Slazo,
354100	358760	the messy responses provoked videos and streams from many smaller creators placing pressure
358760	363620	and stimulating further attacks which caused significant sub losses, particularly for one
363620	367820	creator, I Am Ali, the creator involved with the largest social presence. Nonetheless,
367820	371860	this whole situation hit a multitude of creators involved, with incriminating screenshots and
371860	376140	additional claims affecting their image and causing more and more drama which escalated
376140	382100	to the climax that left us where we are today. But what exactly happened, and why did it?
382100	386700	Well let's have a discussion, as a freeface I do know many of the creators personally,
386700	391580	and therefore, I will naturally seek to defend their character, however, criticism is criticism
391580	396120	and there is a lot to dish out, and a lot of information out there to clear up as well,
396120	398740	so let's go to the beginning of this story.
406320	410500	As said, I had heard about these allegations a month before their publication, however,
410500	414900	there wasn't really much I could do as I had seen no evidence, however, when the allegations
414900	419760	were initially released, they were pretty much supported universally, with a few exceptions,
419760	424120	and understandably so, however, with the knowledge that we have now, that this wasn't exactly
424120	428540	representative of the truth, I want to reflect on the original Twitlonger. The first thing
428540	432940	that I really want to do here is the premise for the Twitlonger's existence, this is both
432940	437680	mentioned at the start and at the end, typically, when we come forward with public claims against
437680	442160	a person, we might want to justify why these claims are necessary. Now I'd argue sometimes
442160	447120	a justification isn't necessary, in cases of severe trauma, it might take a while to come forward
447120	451800	with such allegations, however, it's clear that Che felt that there were conditions that needed to be
451800	456080	fulfilled, in the Twitlonger's instance, the point was that she had been informed Slazo had been
456080	460680	repeating a trend of creepy behaviour that he exhibited to her during a relationship that was
460680	465800	rather predatory and abusive. Now these claims do not directly imply that Slazo has been repeating
465840	471000	this exact pattern of behaviour, but what the author of the Twitlonger implied was that as a public figure,
471000	476840	if Slazo has an incapability to behave responsibly, then he shouldn't be in a position of power at all.
476840	482280	As I mentioned in my Austin Jones video, the sort of dedication that many stans might have influences
482280	487240	their judgement, and therefore, many girls may be susceptible to a predator in a powerful position.
487240	492040	Therefore, with the assertion that he is up to no good, Che presents a testimony that paints Slazo
492040	496760	in a particularly negative light. You have two sides to this Twitlonger, the stories and the screenshots,
496760	502040	now normally the screenshots would be used to substantiate the individual claims, however, with regards to
502040	507520	these screenshots that Che posted, they are more to corroborate the idea of credibility, this is mainly
507520	513360	because many of the testimonies provided are anecdotal, and it would be difficult to directly corroborate them.
513360	518640	The screenshots in this instance set the foundations that Slazo would be someone likely to commit behaviour
518640	524160	reported on in the Twitlonger. DMs will never directly reflect what happens in real life, but whatever they
524160	529360	showed, it revealed someone very forceful in what they wanted from Che. Probably the most incriminating
529360	535520	screenshots are shown at the top, that seem to show Slazo and Che discussing a non-conceptual act from the
535520	540800	position of hindsight, and although it seemed like he was regretful of it, it also seemed to yield a strange
540800	547480	obsession from an urge, as he said it. That urge seems like something that is hard to control, and appears to be
547480	553240	the greatest threat if he is continuing to behave with the mentality that he has expressed in these messages.
553240	558560	Many people took this as definitive evidence that Slazo was a predator, but there were a few details that
558560	563960	made me rather hesitant at the time. The first was that I had been told of additional details when I was informed
563960	569400	in May that didn't make it in the first Twitlonger, arguably this evidence that I was told of was some of the
569400	574680	most incriminating, and although I reserve thought for the possibility that these may be held off due to
574760	579960	possible police involvement, the fact that they had not been mentioned at all, not even in the context of the
579960	585160	idea that they had been passed on to the relative authorities, confused me. Once again, I was not certain about
585160	590360	the circumstances surrounding that information, and the evidence was still convincing on its own terms, but it
590360	596120	was a personal note I had to take. However, something that was a bit more publicly identifiable was a weird
596120	601120	contradiction that caught my attention. This was the talk about how people could change, and although I agree
601120	606560	that people can change, if what was claimed was true, it would be less of a case of whether he had changed,
606560	611120	and more of a case of at least being somewhat accountable for causing a substantial amount of trauma.
611120	616800	It is important to note that at the time of the relationship, Slazo was 16, and Che was 14, and therefore,
616800	622160	although we don't expect Slazo to be the perfect boyfriend, there is a level of responsibility on him.
622160	627040	Anyone with any amount of critical thinking could see that regardless of what he might be up to currently,
627040	632880	he deserves to face some retribution for his transgressions here as well, because it's clear he's done a lot of damage.
632880	639120	People aren't ignorant to moral repercussions, but this is also what confused me, I passed off at the time as Che
639120	644320	tried to sound reasonable, but rereading it, it just seemed rather discordant, and this is something that I
644320	648960	followed through into the second Twitlonger, because in response to Slazo's statement to Drama Alert,
648960	654480	alongside another Twitlonger statement, Che posted screenshots from Instagram from a conversation with Slazo
654480	659680	when he had heard that the first Twitlonger was in the works, these were claimed to incriminate Slazo further.
659680	665440	However, the main premise of these screenshots were, as Che stated, that Slazo appeared to deny none of the claims.
665440	670960	However, when reading this additional statement, I took immediate issue with this premise because there was no guarantee
670960	675280	that Slazo would have known the claims that Che would be making in her original Twitlonger,
675280	680240	as the Instagram conversation had occurred before it, so I found this rather strange.
680240	685120	With this in mind, the DMs themselves don't prove much, however, when you assess them more closely,
685120	690960	I'd argue they make Che look worse, mainly because there are multiple DMs in which Slazo seems to be
690960	695440	desperately asking for these people who have made these claims, and although I completely understand
695440	701520	why the anonymity of victims who haven't gone public yet needs to be protected, there was an evasiveness
701520	707120	about her answers that made me very uncomfortable. After numerous amounts of questions, and lack of answers,
707120	711920	Che changes the topic completely to the damage that he had caused, and it just felt dishonest,
711920	717120	because alright, if you say it publicly, I can see you're trying to present reasonability to the audience,
717120	721200	however there's no reason to say that in this conversation, it's just Slazo.
721200	726240	Who knows what he's done regardless, she had no reason to present reasonability, she could have just vented
726240	730800	that what he did was wrong, but the fact that she tried to play the I heard things about you card,
730800	735520	and then defaulting when Slazo tried to ask further, seemed very suspicious.
735520	740960	It felt disingenuous to me, which is what inspired me to reach out to Slazo, it felt like she knew
740960	746800	the nothing Slazo had done was as terrible as she framed it, and was trying to look for justification
746800	751840	to release these claims when it just wasn't there, while still exaggerating what happened.
751840	756240	And honestly, I didn't really want to speak to someone who had possibly done terrible things,
756240	760880	they provoke an emotional reaction from me and people know my personal history with it,
760880	766560	but it seemed like so many people had preemptively condemned him for something that just wasn't as it seemed,
766560	773600	and I felt he could use a bit of advice, after all, it was advice that would only work if he was truly innocent.
773600	778080	At the end of the day, if you're a popular creator, and you're publicly called out,
778080	783760	it is extremely important that you can defend yourself, these are allegations that will follow you around
783760	788480	because many people will look up your name, someone will recognise your face, it is a matter that extends
788480	793200	into your private life. Whether that defence takes a few days or a couple years sometimes,
793200	799280	these things will take some time to consolidate, just don't rush a statement, or don't try and cut something halfway,
799280	802880	or else people will just think you're trying to get away with it by downplaying it.
802880	808480	By promising that he'd be responding further but not saying too much, he didn't let people take his response apart,
808480	812000	and this gave him maximum scope for a full response.
812000	817360	I wanted to make a video regarding the situation, um, as of a couple weeks ago,
817360	821200	some of you might be wondering why it took so long to make this response.
821200	826240	I've spoken about the aesthetics of his response in a previous video, so I won't go in it too deep,
826240	831600	but there's a lot of points to be taken away, nonetheless relating specifically to the situations in question.
831600	837520	One thing that Slazo couldn't really dispute was the actual content of the DMs, however there was a lot he could dispute,
837520	841200	and we'll discuss how much the DM content was actually compromised.
841200	844880	But we'll look at the video for now. There are two separate things he could do,
844880	852000	firstly present a perspective that makes his story look legitimate, or go the extra mile and disprove the opposing perspective.
852000	859840	Although Che provided DMs, as noted they were much more to construct an image of a character that would imply he's capable of doing those acts,
859840	862640	there was no real evidence with direct reference.
862640	868560	So firstly, Slazo goes in for the anecdotal evidence, he doesn't directly contradict every story,
868560	874880	but he does manage to provide enough evidence to show that some of these stories aren't exactly as they were presented.
874880	884640	She pulls my hand down and says to touch her, which is a pretty long way from how she portrays it in her version of the story.
884640	889360	In fact, she was actually the one who brought up the entire idea of doing anything in the cinema.
889360	895200	It was her idea and I had no reason to believe she wasn't as in on this as I was.
895200	903600	But I do have plenty of evidence from very early on in the relationship where she clearly made no intention to wait until 16.
903600	907760	That was never clear to me, I never got that impression and I don't know why she's saying that.
907760	914400	She also mentions later in the post that she's never been in a relationship before, this isn't the impression that I was under.
914400	921200	I was under the impression from these screenshots here that she's had at least two boyfriends and one girlfriend before we ever met.
921200	928240	This is important because none of the stories were proven necessarily, so the fact that Slazo could at least provide contradiction for some of them
928240	933360	was enough to undermine a key factor necessary to Che's testimony, credibility.
933360	937200	On one hand, Slazo could have straight up denied these claims and left it there,
937200	942400	but the evidence he provided actually showed that Che had not presented these claims in good faith.
942400	947440	Probably the most incriminating factor was that the evidence that he provided was DM related,
947440	954160	and given the fact that Che clearly went through the DMs fairly meticulously to collect as much evidence against Slazo as possible,
954160	960000	it seems she must have avoided a lot of DMs that would show her as not being as helpless as she framed herself as.
960000	966480	Memories can be clouded and inaccurate, but the problem was the memory had become so biased that for many people,
966480	971280	whether Slazo intended to or not showed the claims as released in bad faith.
971280	976640	The same DMs that had incriminated Slazo a few weeks later had suddenly exonerated him.
976640	984640	But previous to these messages, I'd mentioned something, a complaint I had that I probably should have kept to myself,
984640	992400	it was... it's embarrassing for her, and she's saying that she wasn't too keen on doing that thing in the first place,
992400	998320	and now she's embarrassed. Anyway, around here she crops out around 11 minutes of conversation between us,
998320	1002560	where I apologize and try to get her side and understand how she feels.
1003520	1007200	I wasn't very good at it, but I tried.
1007200	1011200	In the video where she's scrolling through her messages here to prove that they're real,
1011200	1017520	she also goes nearly up to where I apologize and try to understand her point of view, but then quickly scrolls down.
1021200	1026000	Ultimately, what made it look the worst for Che was the situation regarding the DMs.
1026000	1030160	This was arguably the most incriminating interaction that she had published,
1030160	1034480	yet she still withheld 10 minutes of conversation without any information.
1034480	1037200	This is content that could not have been merely missed.
1037200	1043440	This brought every claim into contention, and gave Slazo the chance to craft the image from his perspective,
1043440	1046320	and he knew that he messed up, so he owned up.
1046320	1052480	This put him in a position where he was able to apologize but simultaneously from a sympathetic position,
1052480	1055280	as the subject of a smear campaign in a way.
1055280	1058800	I think there's some legitimate criticism here, you know, something has happened,
1058800	1063680	and Slazo may have acted inappropriately, but we'll discuss the problems with this in a bit.
1085280	1090880	about that um she is is very much on board with it with the messages from the time where it actually
1090880	1094800	happened and the way she talks about it then is very different from the way she talks about it in
1094800	1100800	hindsight she also mentions me taking off her bra while she's crying firstly i would never do this
1100800	1106720	if i ever suspected that she didn't want any advance i was making i would stop and also the way
1106720	1112400	she talks about it in the messages from the time gives the impression that i i wasn't even
1112400	1118000	intentionally trying to take off her bra which i wasn't this situation by this point bothered me
1118000	1123440	a lot because allegations shouldn't be botched and they were here with the assumptions that the
1123440	1128000	allegations were purposely misleading which given what we've observed today would be hard to deny
1128000	1132880	it undermined any legitimate criticism that may have been warranted but also showed that this was
1132880	1138080	a situation best left private it was clear from both statements the parties involved had met up
1138080	1142960	and resolved this as people and although the idea that maybe one of them was manipulating the other
1142960	1147120	to think that it was all right seems to be a possibility it seems to me that both of these
1147120	1151680	people have been influenced by the distance placed between them i do have texts from the time that
1151680	1156720	proved the general tone it it felt very comfortable and i felt that she was completely fine with me by
1156720	1161520	this point i felt that her past was behind us and we were just putting the final nail in the coffin
1161520	1166480	by meeting up i really thought this was the case where she says how are you how are you feeling
1166480	1170880	about it all and i said it's nice it's like a weight's been lifted yeah it's great how are
1170880	1175120	you feeling about the stuff we talked about towards the end here she's referring to being
1175120	1179680	friends in the future and maybe getting back together at some point that's what this is
1179680	1184960	referring to oh like the future and stuff yeah um i feel the same as you really would be really nice
1184960	1191120	to be friends again for now obviously it's nothing definitive it's nothing concrete but there's that
1191120	1195280	so take whatever conclusion you will from that believe it or not i've been in a fair share of
1195280	1200560	drama and conflict in my time i have people who i haven't liked on a personal basis however meeting
1200560	1206080	them in person often reminds me that these people are mostly decent no one's perfect and if i thought
1206080	1211200	someone was then i'd probably be a bit more suspicious honestly flaws always exist sometimes
1211200	1215760	they're just a bit more well hidden than others and in spite of these flaws i can share many
1215760	1221200	positive experiences with a person even if i have bad memories with them too i wouldn't expect two
1221200	1226240	people like slather and che to ever be particularly close but it's important to remember how separation
1226240	1231200	might affect your judgment of a person it was clear that it reached a point that che was under
1231200	1236000	the impression that slather was a person deserving to suffer to the point where exaggeration was
1236000	1240560	considered fair game i guess the thing i'm most confused about in this whole thing is
1242000	1247520	why why would she lie why would she why would she say that she'd never been in a relationship before
1247520	1254400	never kissed before intended to wait until 16 and twist the truth of what happened in person and
1254400	1260400	make it and make out like she never wanted to do anything and this wasn't a two-way thing especially
1260400	1266000	at the beginning it it paints a very black and white picture of me being the predator and her
1266000	1273680	being the prey it cuts out all nuance of me not knowing what i'm doing and being an idiot which
1273680	1278240	obviously doesn't excuse what i've said and you know how i've made her feel but
1280800	1285840	it's a very condemning picture that she's painted and the things she said and the things that she's
1285840	1292240	implied that i've done can can very well follow me for life it's never fair game with all the
1292240	1297520	community backing she had falsifying claims that could be disproved with such unbelievably risky
1297520	1302080	business it wasn't a case of possible perspective with reasonable doubt it was a case where she
1302080	1306960	actively omitted content and expected that somehow that would help falsifying claims is
1306960	1312160	never a good idea in the instance that slazo is a predator well congratulations you've let a
1312160	1316960	predator get away and if he's not well that's terrible you just tried to end someone's career
1316960	1322000	over false allegations in the instagram conversation that che and i had before this all went live
1322000	1327520	which is now public record um she expresses concerns that i've been weird with other people
1327520	1333760	and that she's concerned i'll do it again um she doesn't specify who despite me asking a few times
1333760	1338480	and and she also says that she's concerned i have stan accounts and people who are probably willing
1338480	1343040	to send me things for my attention um i said that i've never taken advantage of this and
1343680	1349680	i even offered her my login to prove that i've never done this and wouldn't immediately after
1349680	1355600	offering my login the problem quickly becomes more that i didn't take responsibility and that i need
1355600	1363760	to suffer consequences for my actions um yeah the the reason for it going public quickly changes
1363760	1368560	and yes the whole twitlonger was released under the premise that he had been continuing this trend
1368560	1373360	of behavior but it just seems that he hasn't been no additional evidence has come forward suggesting
1373360	1378160	that he has and it seems strange if someone's prepared to allege that he's been continuing this
1378160	1382480	behavior as reason to come forward regarding this then that should be part of the evidence
1382480	1386480	if you're implying that publicizing your experience wouldn't be necessary if he wasn't
1386480	1391600	continuing this behavior then at that point with your own credibility in serious disrepute it would
1391600	1395840	be incumbent on these new people to come forward to imply that he might still be a threat but
1395840	1400080	unfortunately if they exist and they're not prepared to speak up and many people felt at
1400080	1404720	this point the original claims held no water whatsoever and with the release of slanzo's
1404720	1409920	video angry people flooded over to deal a torrent of criticism towards che but it was soon about to
1409920	1419680	be much bigger than her there had been discussion about the actual formulation of the twitlonger in
1419680	1422880	question because normally when someone makes claims you'd expect them to be the curator of
1422880	1427200	these comments however in this situation it seems like there were a few more people involved this
1427200	1430800	was implied when a couple people commented that they'd been involved but this didn't come under
1430800	1435920	the microscope until after slazo's response after slazo's response many felt like he had made a
1435920	1440160	compelling case for himself and people felt that providing the situation remained as it was that
1440160	1444160	he was entitled to an apology or at least a retraction from those who supported the original
1444160	1448880	twitlonger i don't think people had a particularly high bar because those who had endorsed one opinion
1448880	1453440	shouldn't remain supporting that opinion if they now see it as false in case new fans come along
1453440	1457440	and receive a false impression an apology or attraction is one of the ways that this can be
1457440	1461920	resolved however to many people surprised a few creators involved decided that actually they
1461920	1466720	didn't want to apologize to slazo initially the people who put out public statements were quite
1466720	1471440	blues dank dolan dark westerner i'm alex and king annie although these responses were different
1471440	1476480	shades of tone many found these responses inadequate or misleading some of these responses
1476480	1480880	are not worth talking about such as quites because he just said he wanted to wait for more information
1480880	1486080	which is completely fair however there were a few that did strike me as slightly off well first take
1486080	1491200	a look at king annie someone who i have met and found thoroughly pleasant however the situation
1491200	1495920	didn't do so great for her firstly she had this monumental take that quotes innocent people don't
1495920	1500240	stay quiet for this long a day before slazo released his response and then in response to
1500240	1505840	slazo's video decided to say this a lot of people were pretty focused on alex's take which we will
1505840	1510240	discuss later but i do think this one is significantly worse michael is still guilty for
1510240	1515760	what he did in the past yes we are all guilty for what we've done in the past the question was
1515760	1521120	what exactly happened he did admit to some things most notably a quote complaint he had but it
1521120	1525360	would be incumbent on the people involved to try and exactly pinpoint what the context for
1525360	1529680	this situation is because he said himself that he didn't want to mention it specifically
1529680	1534800	so you have the chance to clarify what this actually was and you didn't no one is glossing
1534800	1540000	over it it's just people can't go after him until they know the specific context until then people
1540000	1545040	will be looking towards you for elaboration and then we have this gaslighting comment which i
1545040	1549680	found rather strange gaslighting is when you make a person doubt their own experiences through
1549680	1554320	manipulation but i don't think she knows what that means also i find it strange that her language
1554320	1558880	implies the fact that she can label this as gaslighting suddenly means it's manipulation
1558880	1563760	and not just manipulation on its own terms it's a strange way to express your position it's like
1563760	1569280	she thinks that people just identify the word manipulation rather than the underlying processes
1569280	1573600	people aren't the smartest sometimes but they're a bit smarter than that then she goes for the
1573600	1578400	mentality argument and yes there was a responsibility on slazo that he failed as a
1578400	1583200	boyfriend there was an age gap frankly put more weight on him but the problem was that it seemed
1583200	1587520	that they were both ignorant in a way that would make their judgment poor other factors like
1587520	1593120	experience also have to be taken into account secondly that's not how i remember it is not a
1593120	1598400	shit rebuttal at all without the evidence sometimes it's the only rebuttal and it's the only way people
1598400	1603760	can defend themselves when they have unsubstantiated claims made against them they cannot directly
1603760	1608080	disprove then we have the final statement that annie makes which brings it back to this notion
1608640	1613120	mistakes and it's okay if you want to stand by your friend i completely understand that
1613120	1617920	that's your choice but these aren't mistakes example in the original twitlonger che states
1617920	1622480	that this was her first relationship in an attempt to make her perspective seem more innocent this is
1622480	1626720	not a passive omission this is not something that she could forget it is an active lie that
1626720	1631760	was contradicted by slazo in his response these mistakes are all over the twitlonger and you can
1631760	1636240	stick up for a character in public but you should have a very stern talking to her in private because
1636240	1640320	given the twitlonger have been in the works for around a month and you took credit for helping
1640320	1644960	her you really should have made sure there wasn't room for such mistakes she ends by saying she
1644960	1649680	hopes he can get some therapy issues that as he has presented the argument seem to be resolved
1649680	1654400	as said i met annie after the statement and she completely defined my expectations i really
1654400	1659200	enjoyed her company and she may genuinely believe this but if she does then i'd really recommend
1659200	1663200	withholding judgment of situations in the future not because she's a friend but because she's a
1663200	1668960	public figure and that sort of exercise of power is obviously going to have a huge influence on
1668960	1673200	someone's judgments plenty of people have spoken to me and said that they think che was manipulated
1673200	1677280	and i think that's very possible too even unintentionally the sort of pressure from
1677280	1682160	such powerful figures to put a statement out would be crushing chase twitlonger is not the
1682160	1687040	sort of thing that people can continue backing even if it's just for the sake of personal pride
1687040	1693120	even if you want to continue backing che as a person even if you don't like slazo even if you
1693120	1698960	find him creepy there's such a dynamic of power in this situation that shouldn't have been used
1698960	1703520	wiesner was the other person who made noteworthy comments in response to this situation and
1703520	1708160	honestly when breaking his comments down they're not that different to annie's okay so i just
1708160	1714080	watched slazo's video his response to his ex-girlfriend che's accusation that he was
1714080	1720720	uh emotionally and perhaps even sexually abusive and my conclusion is that he is just gonna have
1720720	1725680	to learn from his mistakes i mean he fucked up it looks like he's still gonna fuck up again
1725680	1729840	he gives me a lot of impressions that he's definitely manipulator he even owns up to it in
1729840	1734960	his video he definitely seems like the person to to gaslight his partner make them think that
1734960	1738800	things happen differently from what they remember in order to manipulate them and make them
1738800	1745520	apologize for something that wasn't even their fault um i don't want to believe that che is just
1745520	1753760	an outright liar but there was this one clip that always stuck out to me slazo did admit that he was
1753760	1759600	controlling he used the word controlling he didn't say manipulative now all the youtubers are
1759600	1765120	manipulative that's how we got to where we are we manipulate an audience day to day for money i mean
1765120	1769840	like this is what we do i know it has a negative connotation to it but it just is what it is this
1769840	1775360	was not a good thing to say firstly equivocating being controlling and being manipulative and then
1775360	1781360	equivocating being manipulative in the past tense and being manipulative in the present tense
1781360	1787920	we made two huge logical jumps to justify a point of view that we cannot be remotely sure of at all
1787920	1792640	to be honest i think his statement wasn't the worst even though he made that stupid comment
1792640	1796880	about people being manipulative because he did seem to acknowledge that a lot of the information
1796880	1801200	was wrong and it should have remained private but his opinion still just seems to be parroting
1801200	1805520	other people without knowing what those words actually mean it seems like a lot of people
1805520	1811040	involved were just trying to make what he admitted appear worse than what he actually did without
1811040	1816400	proving it was a lot worse despite having the opportunity and people saw through it and people
1816400	1823840	were asking for more and well they got more but not exactly in the way they'd hope all right i'm
1823840	1829200	gonna head to the con in a second of sunburn madam's apple look like a lobster
1832080	1836560	i'm in a lot of pain we go again see you all soon
1838560	1842640	the problem is that when people started making statements like these people saw it as them
1842640	1847520	trying to cover their backsides and for justified reasons the people involved all knew che and if
1847520	1851600	che had more evidence that she was prepared to release other people involved were either better
1851600	1855520	off staying silent or at least informing the audience that there would be more evidence to
1855520	1860880	come however they spoke as if this was it at least for now and people picked up on that one
1860880	1865920	of the most confusing things for me as a viewer was that people who had openly reacted with such
1865920	1870560	shock and surprise when these allegations were first released when many of these claims were
1870560	1875680	counted or disproved suddenly changed their tune as if they knew he was a terrible person anyway
1875680	1879840	and the fact that the claims were falsified oh that doesn't matter as someone who might be a
1879840	1884720	friend to someone like slazo as someone who was not present in the original relationship as
1884720	1890240	someone who felt the shock and surprised i'd be relieved when he put out his response but this
1890240	1895680	was the sort of response that makes people think there's another motive something else behind it
1895680	1902000	i'm alex was another person who honestly i didn't expect to be involved and i really wish he wasn't
1902000	1906240	i've known him for ages and he's been having a rough time recently so i don't want to give him
1906240	1910880	grief he has apologized since but it would be dishonest for me to pretend he doesn't exist
1910880	1914880	he was one of the people who decided that the public deserved a response and whether they did
1914880	1921120	or not it probably wasn't the one that alex should have provided hello guys um i i want to try and
1921120	1926400	put this in as concise way as possible uh but this is my response to michael and slazo's video
1926400	1930800	uh there's a limit on this so if i'm brushing other things i'm trying not to i just want to
1930800	1937120	put everything in here in a place that is easy for people to get to um i want to make a statement
1937120	1941920	because of the fact that obviously i came out and supported che when she posted her to it longer
1941920	1947840	um and obviously now michael's video has come out where he's debunked um some of the things
1947840	1952400	that were put in there my problem with michael was him admitting to doing things that he knew
1952400	1957760	che may not have wanted to do and being incredibly forceful and almost demanding which he admitted
1957760	1962960	to doing in his video which for me is still disgusting um i don't believe he's innocent
1962960	1968320	i i don't think he's innocent at all uh che may not also be innocent and i may have hid stuff and
1968320	1973840	and used jokes to try and maybe push a certain agenda but at the same time the stuff that michael
1973840	1977600	admitted to is stuff that makes me not want to be friends with somebody who is capable of doing
1977600	1982640	those things once again it felt like he'd read a tldr of the video and attempted to derive some
1982640	1987840	conclusions from there it wasn't a good response and admittedly it did confuse me to an extent
1987840	1993440	i'm alex has been covering youtube drama for ages and surely he'd know the do's and don'ts responses
1993440	1997600	in an ideal scenario if there was no more information the best thing to do is to say
1997600	2002000	that you were misled and apologize you don't have to be friends with the person you don't even have
2002000	2007040	to believe that they're a good person but you have to say what you got wrong alex spoke like someone
2007040	2012480	who knew more information was preparing for more information yet as mentioned earlier if there was
2012480	2017280	more information the best thing would be just say nothing at all or to tell people to hold their
2017280	2022480	horses on the other hand i thought there must be more to this because someone wouldn't pick such an
2022480	2028640	obviously bad response when they've been covering responses since the dawn of time but even then
2028640	2033040	putting out an awful response receiving a little backlash only to wait a few weeks and suddenly
2033040	2037520	drop some evidence that will turn the case on its head is a terrible way to go about it as well
2037520	2042240	because people will just be pissed off and ask why on earth you didn't just say there's more to come
2042240	2045840	this gives me the impression that no one was actually certain of additional evidence to be
2045840	2049840	released but was hopeful that there would be some killer response that would make their critics look
2049840	2055600	like idiots sexual misconduct allegations aren't about the gotcha moments with all this in mind i
2055600	2060400	put out a tweet venting my frustration about the handling of the situation and in light of this
2060400	2064720	some people involved reached out to me in private regarding the claims but what they said is there
2064720	2069120	would be a lot more additional evidence and claimants with a high level of certainty this
2069120	2073440	caused me a lot of confusion because as aforementioned with their current statements
2073440	2078880	people involved were about to receive a lot of criticism but who was the main recipient of the
2078880	2083840	sites of the ravenous commentator our friend alex people were not happy about his response in
2083840	2089440	particular but why well as noted earlier he is a commentator who is renowned for his takes on
2089440	2094240	youtube drama in fact many people view him as one of the most credible commentators in the community
2094240	2099040	and therefore his fumbling was a huge stain on his takes this was brought forward in tandem with
2099040	2103440	his james charles take which many people criticized him about honestly i thought his
2103440	2107760	original video was a fairly natural reaction to a situation that seemed pretty different to the
2107760	2111840	truth and to be fair he did actually apologize for that take although some people felt that
2111840	2116080	his original video should have been removed and that was a justified position too that i agree
2116080	2120800	with these back-to-back situations someone who people seem to have much higher standards for
2120800	2125040	made the criticism a lot more stinging on top of this there are people who have some pretty
2125040	2129360	personal grudges against him two of those creators being kavos and keemstar the kavos
2129360	2134160	feud has been a long personal conflict originating way back from when kavos made a video on wild
2134160	2139680	spartans i'm alex's then friend a while later i'm alex then clapped back with a video of his own
2139680	2145440	which kavos replied to when keemstar shafted kavos over a dispute regarding drama channels i'm alex
2145440	2150080	actually intervened and defended kavos which seemed to put the conflict to rest with kavos
2150080	2154320	even suggesting that he was happy that alex's channel was doing well however this will fall
2154320	2158080	apart when both the creators appeared to intend to meet each other but never did
2158080	2162160	with alex claiming that he tried to meet him multiple times and kavos saying that this just
2162160	2167600	wasn't true this new situation gave kavos a whole new round of ammunition to take aim at alex with
2167600	2174160	the backing of keemstar what he's done i think we can all agree is just inexcusable and there
2174160	2179360	needs to be some sort of consequence for that you can't just go around doing this be a commentary
2179440	2185040	youtube over 1.6 million subs and do that how can anyone trust him again how can he have any
2185040	2190240	credibility that is what you need as a commentator how can he be a commentator after all of that
2190240	2195600	keemstar on the other hand has hated alex fairly consistently for a long time from a situation
2195600	2200720	rooting back to keemstar's beta podcast a podcast featuring keem fellow british commentator
2200720	2206160	colossal is crazy and drama streamer tommy c after a conversation alex reported that keemstar
2206160	2210480	was the instigating factor for its demise he made a twitter video when he knew clown
2210480	2215920	couldn't defend himself accusing him of asking for more money and accusing clown of refusing
2215920	2220880	to cooperate when in all reality it was king keemstar since claimed that alex is a social
2220880	2226480	climber who will only use people for his opportunistic game last night you said the
2226480	2234240	reason why i don't like you is because you don't like me that's that's retarded you're actually
2234240	2240560	retarded look dude the reason why i don't like you is because you uploaded a video and you made
2240560	2246160	up a bunch of lives about me that was the start of it um then you kept doing this repeatedly then
2246160	2250720	you started fucking leeching off people and using them to kind of get where you were ironically this
2250720	2255840	situation spurred members of the community on so much that keemstar and tommy c long opposed to
2255840	2260160	each other put their differences aside and reunited with colossal to record an episode
2260160	2265520	of the baited podcast relating specifically to this situation if the community all starts hating
2265520	2271040	pewdiepie one day he would hate pewdiepie right if the community starts loving pewdiepie he loves
2271040	2278400	pewdiepie like dude this guy is a flip-flopping piece of i hate him he's not a real person he's
2278400	2283280	not a real person with real opinions and real thoughts boogie does the same thing always goes
2283280	2288640	with the popular vote and he'll retract his opinion in a heartbeat well his heart beats
2288720	2293840	pretty fucking fast to be honest with the clear evidence that there was some fuel in the tank
2293840	2298720	other smaller creators jumped on the opportunity to upload videos on i'm alex claiming either his
2298720	2303840	disloyalty to slazo or his hypocrisy regarding situations the reason he had become the target
2303840	2308400	was mostly circumstantial nothing he'd done at this stage was different to many other creators
2308400	2312400	and i was concerned that people would forget about the greater points that were to be made
2312400	2317440	my concerns were confirmed when alex unwisely decided to speak to some of these smaller creators
2317440	2321600	in a private call which would honestly not remain private for long he allegedly disclosed
2321600	2326400	multiple details regarding the situation these creators then decided that they would do what
2326400	2343840	they know best talk about it and oh dear oh dear oh dear in this call it is alleged that all sorts
2343840	2348800	of information was divulged the prime recipient of this information was a youtuber slash streamer
2348800	2353760	named nicholas diorio who then went and passed on alex's numerous comments to various creators
2353760	2359840	some who were directly referenced and others for video purposes i have no clue why alex thought
2359840	2363840	this was a good idea but it wasn't people are always nicer in conversation than when they're
2363840	2367840	publicly talking about you and it seems that alex was under the impression that if he told them
2367840	2372880	aside they'd be a bit softer on him in public unfortunately that was not the case diorio took
2372880	2377440	alex's comments regarding slazo straight to slazo and conducted an interview in which he asked
2377440	2382880	slazo his opinions on these takes alex claims that you had been rough and forceful with a girl
2382880	2387280	while staying with him he claimed you were completely sober and forcefully getting this
2387280	2392640	woman drunk allegedly alex had to step in and remove the girl from the situation as you begun
2392640	2398080	kissing and sent her home in an uber alex also claimed he told you we don't do that shit around
2398080	2406640	here man and bullied you for the next few days yes um yeah this was really confusing to hear
2406640	2414240	honestly um this is a complete um embellishment of what happened he also took comments about
2414240	2418640	other people to the parties mentioned and informed them too we'll return to this point later but it
2418640	2423680	was basically the release of a pandora's box of information into the community and provided plenty
2423680	2428400	more content for creators to nor on one of these creators was turkey tom who for legal reasons i
2428400	2433680	must disclose isn't actually a turkey and why is your name turkey tom but you're not a turkey
2433680	2438240	all right if you really wanted to pull this off and brand it right you'd be a fucking turkey
2438240	2442720	he was making a video on the slazo situation covering the various responses and one of the
2442720	2447040	people who had been regularly mentioned in private but not so much in public was a creator by the
2447040	2451920	name of hyojin it was claimed that among other things alex had implied various facts about hyojin
2451920	2456000	in a call with oreo which were then publicized subsequently although i cannot confirm whether
2456000	2459840	alex actually said this many people seem to believe that he did given their own personal
2459840	2464640	relationships with him and some even publicly reacted with hostility when a certain situation
2464640	2469360	that we'll talk about later transpired these claims also seem to be unsubstantiated and many
2469360	2474160	others involved said they simply weren't true hyojin is a creator slash artist who is closely
2474160	2478640	associated with che she hasn't been too vocal about the situation however have been involved
2478640	2482560	in assisting the release of the twitlong behind the scenes she was named and saved and what
2482560	2487120	happens when a creator is called out is that often people like to go one step further and see what
2487120	2491920	other shady behavior they may be partaking in when hyojin's name was dragged out under the sun
2491920	2497920	a lot followed a lot of offensive dms a lot of testimonies from people who had negative experiences
2497920	2502560	and some further rumors some of this stuff was definitely warranting criticism for example an
2502560	2507440	nsfw blog in which she posted explicit art of people from within the community some of these
2507440	2512160	people were quite underage and others definitely didn't consent to it however other claims were
2512160	2517440	slightly more shaky and also rather invasive in a person's private life so where does turkey tom
2517440	2521840	come into this well he uploaded a video on the situation in which he addresses the involvement
2521840	2526400	of many individuals and one of them is hyojin this was not too long after the information of
2526400	2531440	her involvement had been floated from the private call besides the multiple other allegations
2531440	2536560	regarding her behavior in tom's video he made some very fair points that would deserve criticism for
2536560	2541040	the parties involved however when going through hyojin's involvement although mostly focusing
2541040	2545840	on the content that was fairly verifiable he divulged two pieces of psa that were probably
2545840	2549840	rather inappropriate the first was a rumor regarding an affair that should not have gone
2549840	2554560	in a public video and the second was a set of allegations regarding animal maltreatment
2554560	2559200	relating back to the claim by an anonymous source that she was not just unpleasant but had a habit
2559200	2564960	of picking up a dog and placing it on its back now i cannot comment on the verifiability of these
2564960	2569920	claims but the problem was the second claim was so outlandish and ridiculous that it immediately
2569920	2574800	caught the most attention despite arguably being the least relevant now normally with such a claim
2574800	2579840	we would think about it critically innocent until proven guilty however people were so caught up in
2579840	2584480	the sentiment of criticizing kyojin that it was just lumped in there with all the actual other
2584480	2589040	legitimate criticism and because it is arguably the strangest claim it became the claim that was
2589040	2594560	referenced the most and ultimately became a focus alongside the already existent criticism of her
2594560	2599200	content in the situation it finally provoked a response from her however these responses were
2599200	2603920	not well received because they weren't very good and people continue to lump pressure onto her
2603920	2608560	creators made additional videos turkey tom made a second video in which he responded to heojin's
2608560	2613120	comments and provided further elaboration to his points and although there was still attention on
2613120	2618400	other people involved it's clear that a lot was said about heojin and she became a very easy
2618400	2623440	target due to her incompetence in dealing with this however it's clear that people had become
2623440	2628160	too carried away on the basis of some shaky criticism and some character and it was easy
2628160	2633680	to witness ultimately the sort of mob had turned on heojin and it was becoming very toxic and after
2633680	2638400	a few days she blacked out her twitter and it was reported she'd attempted to take her own life
2638400	2643200	fortunately she survived and was hospitalized however this provoked a lot of further conflict
2643200	2647920	from within the community at first there was an immediate reaction an outpouring of support in the
2648000	2653440	hashtag love for heojin movement trying to reverse what it had become but soon enough people began
2653440	2657520	to make more provocative statements maybe people began to turn on those who had rustled up this
2657520	2662480	scenario stating that they were partly accountable for this terrible situation however in response
2662480	2666720	to this many of the lead critics asked if the attempt really changed any of the points that
2666720	2670640	were being made against her it's a tough discussion because both of these points are
2670640	2675440	extremely sensitive but neither of them are entirely invalid if someone did something
2675440	2680000	terrible and attempted on their life no it does not change the terrible thing they did
2680000	2684720	but i also think the point of criticism is to improve someone not drive them off the edge
2684720	2689520	and mixing in unsubstantiated rumors in there just generally harmed the case that could have
2689520	2695040	been much more focused on what actually happened and not drive someone's image down as some sort
2695040	2700000	of dog tipper it's why we should always make our criticism as clear as possible from a personal
2700000	2705680	perspective we will always provoke some backlash onto a person if we criticize them however firstly
2705680	2710160	we want to make sure that we don't cause harassment and secondly we don't want to provide
2710160	2714880	backlash on the basis of false information nonetheless that does not mean that harassment
2714880	2719360	is accountable to the original critic because there will always be some people who look for
2719360	2724480	an excuse to harass people regardless and there has to be some level of personal responsibility
2724480	2730160	for such behavior in this situation i don't think anyone maliciously intended to provoke harassment
2730160	2735120	nor do i think anyone can singly be blamed for reporting on a lot of this but going in with
2735120	2739520	outlandish rumors at a time where people saw a lot of the claims as flying regardless of whether
2739520	2744320	they had wings or not was probably not the best shout try and make sure that what you're basing
2744320	2748960	your content off is as well founded as they come it doesn't just help the person you may be
2748960	2754000	criticizing but it helps your case too and prevents this sort of situation coming back today
2754000	2758960	to tom's credit he has actually made changes to his videos that remove the unsubstantiated claims
2758960	2764240	and anyone who also did that should receive their fair credit it's an emotional situation and people
2764240	2769120	do feel really strongly about it i respect that when people made their videos i don't think it
2769120	2774480	came from a place of ha ha drama let's cash in i genuinely think this mattered to people because
2774480	2779840	people did feel strongly about being in a position where you would be exposed for something that you
2779840	2785760	didn't do and you could have your whole career ruined that provoked strong feelings understandably
2785760	2791200	so however although this was the situation that brought the drama to a halt it was still a very
2791200	2797120	small part of a very complex puzzle because there were still so many unanswered questions regarding
2797120	2802320	how and why this happened and what exactly was going on behind the scenes and that's what i want
2802320	2820080	to discuss now why is arguably the most important question that one can ask because once you find
2820080	2824640	the underlying roots of a scenario then you might be able to exactly understand the cause for these
2824640	2830080	situations and hopefully work on avoiding them in the future that's important for anyone involved
2830080	2834480	at the end of the day the goal is to make sure that anyone who is a threat to those around them
2834480	2839760	is addressed properly and innocent parties are left alone so that we can elevate victims and
2839760	2844560	make sure that they have a voice there are many reasons that people have hypothesized how this
2844560	2849280	has happened one of the more popular theories is that of competition and although it would be
2849280	2854240	certainly an interesting albeit sinister twist i don't think that is the case i don't think those
2854240	2858720	creators were threatened by the prospect of another creator covering a similar genre and
2858720	2863520	slazo wasn't a similar genre to many of the creators involved anyway it would certainly
2863520	2869440	take a very elaborate plan to take out someone for the mere reason of being competition i also
2869440	2874480	don't think it's a group conspiracy i don't think that everyone involved in the release of the
2874480	2879120	statement had malintent it seems plausible that one or two people color the perception of the
2879120	2886480	party but it seems unlikely that we'll be able to work out exactly who in light of the situation
2886480	2891760	we've seen a few party members involved openly apologize their involvement this seems like the
2891760	2896720	right thing to do at this point however it still doesn't really answer why a couple people doubled
2896720	2900720	down at the time some have stated that they thought they'd heard more stories but it just
2900720	2904880	seems confusing that if the first claims were disproved they'd stand by these additional
2904880	2909920	claims and openly call out slazo if they were unsubstantiated which is what they seem like
2909920	2914640	on top of this a fair few people still defend che's intentions or say that they thought she
2914640	2919520	genuinely didn't have the idea of leaving out all this evidence and once again although someone may
2919520	2925280	be genuinely hurt it really can't excuse what happened it really can't change the fact that she
2925280	2930160	would have had to have gone through all these messages and she didn't just accidentally miss
2930160	2936800	out 10 minutes of dms it's impossible to really work around it doesn't really excuse what happened
2936800	2942160	and doesn't really make sense either the fact that someone just accidentally left out 10 minutes of
2942160	2947840	conversation i can't look inside their soul and completely deduce what was going on which made
2947840	2953280	so many people desperate to justify that slazo wasn't a good person but given the similarity
2953280	2958400	of all the responses and the general misuse of terminology it seems like it was just a case of
2958400	2963280	group think with some people's ignorance taken advantage of by a less than well-meaning actor
2963280	2968480	perhaps but that's just a theory some people haven't commented further that will be for better
2968480	2973360	or for worse some people have like westner i love you i don't understand priming's video
2973360	2978080	makes you sound evil uh yeah it's just some fucking guy some fucking content content vulture
2978080	2983920	this is yeah i mean what do you expect making video about the drama like a month after it
2983920	2988720	happens quick point buddy primink isn't a content vulture he's a guy who cares a lot about a
2988720	2993200	situation that you claim to care about too and the fact that you have the nerve to judge people's
2993200	2997360	character on the basis of them calling out is pretty rotten if you don't feel like there's
2997360	3001920	anything more to say then don't say anything more there were also some people claiming that
3001920	3007120	people at the actual insomnia event knew which i can't say i agree with either even if people were
3007120	3012000	unsure at the time i don't think they would have invited him over with that knowledge with that
3012000	3016240	said there were definitely people who have known for a while who were not at the event and that
3016240	3021600	does bother me because no one thought to tell me or many other people what was going on people know
3021600	3026480	that there are people there with strong history with sexual misconduct and even when i was told
3026480	3031680	personally i was still not meant to know and even then if he was a threat people really sat
3031680	3036320	on this evidence for such an exceptionally long time as if he wasn't going out and about in his
3036320	3042000	daily life interacting with multiple females it all felt so fine-tuned it was more designed to be
3042000	3046640	a spectacle than an actual post and that's what bothered a lot of people myself included in my
3046640	3051120	opinion there have been people trying to get individuals to disassociate from slazo due to
3051120	3055600	how they perceived his behavior and it reached a person who insisted that they needed to go public
3055600	3060560	with this information but unfortunately it just wasn't there and you know i do believe that people
3060560	3065760	act with earnest intent when trying to bring these things to light i will defend many of those people
3065760	3071120	but the fact is that it took a month to come out with a much less than adequate allegations
3071120	3076960	embellished with evidence that had clearly not been closely looked at i mean it's infuriating
3076960	3081280	and it has taken its toll plenty of people have lost subscribers plenty of people haven't been
3081280	3085760	doing mentally well out of all the drama watching this one was probably the most painful but i felt
3085760	3090320	it was worth saying something because as someone who saw a lot of it going on in the inside it took
3090320	3095040	a toll not just on the people directly involved but on a lot of the people around and the
3095040	3099920	relationships they had i've now heard multiple contradicting statements from people involved
3099920	3105040	which don't add up people who i believe i could trust i heard them out i believed them and
3105040	3110800	supported them but since then i've had to take a step back and ask myself who i put my faith in
3110800	3115440	it's draining it makes me miserable and i'll always stand up for the people who are my friends
3115440	3120160	if anyone asks me about the intentions of people involved i defend them to the bitter end but there
3120160	3124080	are some things that never sat right with me throughout this all and nothing has really
3124080	3128880	righted those feelings of discontent there were people who did not treat those around them like
3128880	3133520	friends a lot of youtubers should look at the slazo situation and take a long hard look at
3133520	3138240	themselves and the way they treat their friends as for slazo well i want to take a brief moment
3138240	3142720	to critique him independently it's clear he's had some problems but i don't think those problems
3142720	3147040	are problems that he's not been working on and it's clear he acknowledged that he's behaved as
3147040	3152160	a bad boyfriend in many ways being controlling is a poor show and there are definitely certain
3152160	3156720	things that he has admitted to that would be worthy of criticism floating the idea that his
3156720	3161840	girlfriend should take different antidepressants that would aid her sex drive like she said the
3161840	3168240	thing i didn't go there when she was on a period i suggested at one point that she go off her
3168880	3174560	antidepressant well i suggested she'd go to another one but at other points i insinuated
3174560	3182480	that it might be a bad thing that she was on these antidepressants why first her sex drive
3182480	3189200	yeah like she said oh two so your intention was to amplify it or to decrease it to em to
3189760	3194560	yeah to amplify it yeah all right that's that's the point against you i would say
3194560	3199040	it was exceptionally inappropriate and we don't know the context of this he may have just
3199040	3204000	suggested it one time passing or it may have been a more coercive problem but he's been given a
3204000	3209280	chance to address himself in this situation and i am pleased with that he has the chance to improve
3209280	3214880	himself and work on his image i do not believe he's a bad person though that's just my opinion
3214880	3219840	and i may have been duped the slazo may not be the change man that i view him as now and i'll
3219840	3225600	have to hold my hands up and that's okay because we get things wrong sometimes i've got things
3225600	3230800	wrong i'm probably gonna get things wrong again we can't expect to get everything completely right
3230800	3236080	but if we end up in a situation that is so much bigger than us where a person's career might rely
3236080	3241120	on our own conduct then we need to hold our hands up and if there's more to come then just let
3241120	3245680	people know if you think that holding off information and surprise releasing it in bits
3245680	3251760	is gonna own your critics you are really wrong allegations are not film sequels although i have
3251760	3256000	spoken about my involvement in this it would be unfair to not note the work of the many people
3256000	3260560	who did provide slazo with the support when certain creators continued to turn on him in
3260560	3265680	spite of his rather conclusive response with what we know i do believe they did the right thing and
3265680	3270240	provided substantial criticism to names who would have otherwise gone unchecked and i must give them
3270240	3275920	their due credit to finish i definitely urge people to take a bit more of a careful response
3275920	3279840	to allegations in the future there's nothing wrong with throwing your weight behind and taking a
3279840	3284240	stand and making creators address these things at the end of the day i do believe it's their
3284240	3288960	responsibility but definitely don't go on a clowning stampede the main goal should be to
3288960	3293840	have people address it and if they can't they've messed up then we can enact what we view as a
3293840	3300000	proportional response justice is a responsibility incumbent on the community creators and audiences
3300640	3305600	it's a shame that it was misused in this instance but hopefully it's at a close now and we can all
