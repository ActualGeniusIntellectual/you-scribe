Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:21.680 --> 00:26.640
too much free time. And my oh my, do we have a topic on our hands today. I know this is

00:26.640 --> 00:30.440
late but honestly it's a subject that has taken made twists and turns, that it was worth

00:30.440 --> 00:35.260
waiting just in case any final revelations were brought forward, and obviously this video

00:35.260 --> 00:38.960
does not exempt the fact that there may be further twists and turns in the case, and

00:38.960 --> 00:43.380
also does not mean that any new unrelated information may compromise the character of

00:43.380 --> 00:49.040
those involved. So let's talk about gaming festivals, who loves them? I mean honestly

00:49.040 --> 00:54.160
I think gaming festivals would be really swell if there were less people, or no people even,

00:54.160 --> 00:58.760
because I do like video games but I don't like having to wait to play them, often I just find myself

00:58.760 --> 01:02.640
aimlessly wandering and occasionally bumping into people who I may have seen at previous

01:02.640 --> 01:07.000
events and retaking the same photo, just this time with a slightly greater inkling of fatigue

01:07.000 --> 01:11.160
reflected in my weary smile. The pinball machines are good though, especially when you don't

01:11.160 --> 01:15.680
have to pave them, hooray for free things. Anyhow, the gaming festival that is of interest

01:15.680 --> 01:21.920
is Insomnia Gaming Festival 64, abbreviated to i64, this ran from the Easter weekend from

01:21.920 --> 01:26.840
the 19th to the 22nd of April, I saw a lot of close friends again, and met a lot of great

01:26.840 --> 01:31.560
creators. It's always nice to do so, because it humanises all these people, and puts the

01:31.560 --> 01:36.000
internet into perspective. One of these people I met at the event was a bloke called Michael,

01:36.000 --> 01:40.800
known online as Slazo, he was pleasant, I had some facetious flirtatious exchanges with

01:40.800 --> 01:45.200
him, and after the event my life carried on, I knew some of the creators that I had met

01:45.200 --> 01:49.600
there were going to London afterwards, Slazo included, and I would have joined them, but

01:49.600 --> 01:54.480
alas, I had university to complete, and I still felt that YouTube was an unstable source

01:54.480 --> 01:59.400
of income, so I wanted something to fall back onto in case everything fell apart. A few

01:59.400 --> 02:04.400
weeks later, around mid-May, I was alternating between university work and checking my social

02:04.400 --> 02:09.220
blade when one of my acquaintances messaged me quite shocking news, apparently Slazo,

02:09.220 --> 02:14.240
the person who I'd met at i64, was going to be exposed, as a predator, he was just

02:14.240 --> 02:18.140
as surprised as I was, apparently these claims were going to be published on a twitlonger

02:18.140 --> 02:23.180
in the following week. So I waited with anticipation, as I hadn't actually seen any of the evidence,

02:23.180 --> 02:26.620
I didn't really talk to anyone about it, although I did tell one of my friends who

02:26.620 --> 02:31.800
was making a documentary about i64 to perhaps consider excluding any footage with him in,

02:31.800 --> 02:36.940
in case it might taint the finished product, more as an act of caution really. So I waited,

02:36.940 --> 02:42.580
and waited, and waited. A month later a twitlonger was published by a person named Fizzypop,

02:42.580 --> 02:47.240
who goes by the name of Che, it documented the allegations against Slazo, these allegations

02:47.240 --> 02:51.640
painted him as a sex-hungry predator who exploited the innocence and inexperience

02:51.640 --> 02:56.400
of a younger individual in the relationship, aggressively obtaining gratification when

02:56.400 --> 03:00.600
she didn't want to offer it. This was met with immediate support from the community,

03:00.600 --> 03:04.840
including many large youtubers, it was clearly a very emotional topic for many people and

03:04.840 --> 03:09.460
many wanted to show their support for a victim. Alongside the twitlonger, there was a substantial

03:09.460 --> 03:14.300
amount of screenshots that appeared to provide irrefutable evidence that Slazo was behaving

03:14.300 --> 03:18.380
in just this fashion, including multiple allusions to sexual assault which seemed to

03:18.380 --> 03:23.300
corroborate her testimony. I may naturally hesitant person however, so I decided to wait

03:23.300 --> 03:27.740
a bit more. Obviously I didn't really blame anyone who wanted to show their support because

03:27.740 --> 03:32.800
many of them are clearly invested, and many people behind the scenes may have information

03:32.800 --> 03:37.300
that I may not be privy to, and the screenshots themselves were undoubtedly compelling. It

03:37.300 --> 03:41.900
was a few days later that DramaAlert reported on the situation, with a screenshot of Slazo's

03:41.900 --> 03:46.380
initial statement. It was nothing too revealing, said some of the claims were false or exceptionally

03:46.380 --> 03:50.400
misleading, and understandably said that he would be working on a reply that would take

03:50.400 --> 03:54.600
a little more time. He also said that he was caught off guard by these claims as he had

03:54.600 --> 03:59.980
met Che since the relationship and supposedly put it all behind them. My judgement was skeptical

03:59.980 --> 04:03.520
of his statement at this point, but if he was prepared to reply then I expected him

04:03.520 --> 04:07.920
to have something at least. However then Fizzy Pop decided to release an additional response

04:07.920 --> 04:12.520
to Slazo's statement. It is stated that they had a conversation on Instagram in which Slazo

04:12.520 --> 04:16.880
did not deny any of the claims that she made, thus incriminating him further. Many people

04:16.880 --> 04:21.400
once again stood behind these claims and supported Che with what she was saying, no one with

04:21.400 --> 04:25.880
any decent amount of common sense was going to instigate grief onto a possible victim

04:25.880 --> 04:30.460
of sexual predation. However, behind the scenes something didn't sit right with me, I already

04:30.460 --> 04:34.400
mentioned this in a previous video and I'll go into more depth later, but looking at the

04:34.400 --> 04:38.780
conversation something about the tone of Che just made me uncomfortable, so I confronted

04:38.780 --> 04:43.160
Slazo and told him that, although he's deserving of some very genuine criticism, if it had

04:43.160 --> 04:47.360
been taken out of context like he claimed, in spite of the risk, it would be worth showing

04:47.360 --> 04:51.940
the additional content because the importance of protecting your social image is vital.

04:51.940 --> 04:55.160
These are things that will stick with someone for life, and if she has shown what would

04:55.160 --> 04:59.380
frame you as terrible, if you say you want to show evidence but then don't, people will

04:59.380 --> 05:04.580
take that, well as it seems, incriminating. Our conversation ended and I waited for his

05:04.580 --> 05:09.460
video, and on the evening of June 27th he finally responded, it was a strong video,

05:09.460 --> 05:13.860
I had to watch it a few times through, and once again I'll save my thoughts for later

05:13.860 --> 05:17.840
on. Although I was pleased he had managed to present his side, I was also anticipating

05:17.840 --> 05:22.500
possible additional responses, as said, at this point in time it felt like a situation

05:22.500 --> 05:27.040
that was mostly between him and Che, although it had caught my attention that certain people

05:27.040 --> 05:31.140
had openly taken credit when the initial statement came out, I assumed that their involvement

05:31.140 --> 05:35.340
would be addressed when we had assessed the validity of the claims. However, what quickly

05:35.340 --> 05:39.600
happened was a descent into community civil war, many people who had been involved in

05:39.600 --> 05:43.800
the release of the original statement decided to tweet out further comments, many of these

05:43.800 --> 05:48.240
people decided to continue backing Che, however, many of their statements were vague and also

05:48.240 --> 05:54.100
frustrated many audiences. This led to pressure on creators to hashtag apologize to Slazo,

05:54.100 --> 05:58.760
the messy responses provoked videos and streams from many smaller creators placing pressure

05:58.760 --> 06:03.620
and stimulating further attacks which caused significant sub losses, particularly for one

06:03.620 --> 06:07.820
creator, I Am Ali, the creator involved with the largest social presence. Nonetheless,

06:07.820 --> 06:11.860
this whole situation hit a multitude of creators involved, with incriminating screenshots and

06:11.860 --> 06:16.140
additional claims affecting their image and causing more and more drama which escalated

06:16.140 --> 06:22.100
to the climax that left us where we are today. But what exactly happened, and why did it?

06:22.100 --> 06:26.700
Well let's have a discussion, as a freeface I do know many of the creators personally,

06:26.700 --> 06:31.580
and therefore, I will naturally seek to defend their character, however, criticism is criticism

06:31.580 --> 06:36.120
and there is a lot to dish out, and a lot of information out there to clear up as well,

06:36.120 --> 06:38.740
so let's go to the beginning of this story.

06:46.320 --> 06:50.500
As said, I had heard about these allegations a month before their publication, however,

06:50.500 --> 06:54.900
there wasn't really much I could do as I had seen no evidence, however, when the allegations

06:54.900 --> 06:59.760
were initially released, they were pretty much supported universally, with a few exceptions,

06:59.760 --> 07:04.120
and understandably so, however, with the knowledge that we have now, that this wasn't exactly

07:04.120 --> 07:08.540
representative of the truth, I want to reflect on the original Twitlonger. The first thing

07:08.540 --> 07:12.940
that I really want to do here is the premise for the Twitlonger's existence, this is both

07:12.940 --> 07:17.680
mentioned at the start and at the end, typically, when we come forward with public claims against

07:17.680 --> 07:22.160
a person, we might want to justify why these claims are necessary. Now I'd argue sometimes

07:22.160 --> 07:27.120
a justification isn't necessary, in cases of severe trauma, it might take a while to come forward

07:27.120 --> 07:31.800
with such allegations, however, it's clear that Che felt that there were conditions that needed to be

07:31.800 --> 07:36.080
fulfilled, in the Twitlonger's instance, the point was that she had been informed Slazo had been

07:36.080 --> 07:40.680
repeating a trend of creepy behaviour that he exhibited to her during a relationship that was

07:40.680 --> 07:45.800
rather predatory and abusive. Now these claims do not directly imply that Slazo has been repeating

07:45.840 --> 07:51.000
this exact pattern of behaviour, but what the author of the Twitlonger implied was that as a public figure,

07:51.000 --> 07:56.840
if Slazo has an incapability to behave responsibly, then he shouldn't be in a position of power at all.

07:56.840 --> 08:02.280
As I mentioned in my Austin Jones video, the sort of dedication that many stans might have influences

08:02.280 --> 08:07.240
their judgement, and therefore, many girls may be susceptible to a predator in a powerful position.

08:07.240 --> 08:12.040
Therefore, with the assertion that he is up to no good, Che presents a testimony that paints Slazo

08:12.040 --> 08:16.760
in a particularly negative light. You have two sides to this Twitlonger, the stories and the screenshots,

08:16.760 --> 08:22.040
now normally the screenshots would be used to substantiate the individual claims, however, with regards to

08:22.040 --> 08:27.520
these screenshots that Che posted, they are more to corroborate the idea of credibility, this is mainly

08:27.520 --> 08:33.360
because many of the testimonies provided are anecdotal, and it would be difficult to directly corroborate them.

08:33.360 --> 08:38.640
The screenshots in this instance set the foundations that Slazo would be someone likely to commit behaviour

08:38.640 --> 08:44.160
reported on in the Twitlonger. DMs will never directly reflect what happens in real life, but whatever they

08:44.160 --> 08:49.360
showed, it revealed someone very forceful in what they wanted from Che. Probably the most incriminating

08:49.360 --> 08:55.520
screenshots are shown at the top, that seem to show Slazo and Che discussing a non-conceptual act from the

08:55.520 --> 09:00.800
position of hindsight, and although it seemed like he was regretful of it, it also seemed to yield a strange

09:00.800 --> 09:07.480
obsession from an urge, as he said it. That urge seems like something that is hard to control, and appears to be

09:07.480 --> 09:13.240
the greatest threat if he is continuing to behave with the mentality that he has expressed in these messages.

09:13.240 --> 09:18.560
Many people took this as definitive evidence that Slazo was a predator, but there were a few details that

09:18.560 --> 09:23.960
made me rather hesitant at the time. The first was that I had been told of additional details when I was informed

09:23.960 --> 09:29.400
in May that didn't make it in the first Twitlonger, arguably this evidence that I was told of was some of the

09:29.400 --> 09:34.680
most incriminating, and although I reserve thought for the possibility that these may be held off due to

09:34.760 --> 09:39.960
possible police involvement, the fact that they had not been mentioned at all, not even in the context of the

09:39.960 --> 09:45.160
idea that they had been passed on to the relative authorities, confused me. Once again, I was not certain about

09:45.160 --> 09:50.360
the circumstances surrounding that information, and the evidence was still convincing on its own terms, but it

09:50.360 --> 09:56.120
was a personal note I had to take. However, something that was a bit more publicly identifiable was a weird

09:56.120 --> 10:01.120
contradiction that caught my attention. This was the talk about how people could change, and although I agree

10:01.120 --> 10:06.560
that people can change, if what was claimed was true, it would be less of a case of whether he had changed,

10:06.560 --> 10:11.120
and more of a case of at least being somewhat accountable for causing a substantial amount of trauma.

10:11.120 --> 10:16.800
It is important to note that at the time of the relationship, Slazo was 16, and Che was 14, and therefore,

10:16.800 --> 10:22.160
although we don't expect Slazo to be the perfect boyfriend, there is a level of responsibility on him.

10:22.160 --> 10:27.040
Anyone with any amount of critical thinking could see that regardless of what he might be up to currently,

10:27.040 --> 10:32.880
he deserves to face some retribution for his transgressions here as well, because it's clear he's done a lot of damage.

10:32.880 --> 10:39.120
People aren't ignorant to moral repercussions, but this is also what confused me, I passed off at the time as Che

10:39.120 --> 10:44.320
tried to sound reasonable, but rereading it, it just seemed rather discordant, and this is something that I

10:44.320 --> 10:48.960
followed through into the second Twitlonger, because in response to Slazo's statement to Drama Alert,

10:48.960 --> 10:54.480
alongside another Twitlonger statement, Che posted screenshots from Instagram from a conversation with Slazo

10:54.480 --> 10:59.680
when he had heard that the first Twitlonger was in the works, these were claimed to incriminate Slazo further.

10:59.680 --> 11:05.440
However, the main premise of these screenshots were, as Che stated, that Slazo appeared to deny none of the claims.

11:05.440 --> 11:10.960
However, when reading this additional statement, I took immediate issue with this premise because there was no guarantee

11:10.960 --> 11:15.280
that Slazo would have known the claims that Che would be making in her original Twitlonger,

11:15.280 --> 11:20.240
as the Instagram conversation had occurred before it, so I found this rather strange.

11:20.240 --> 11:25.120
With this in mind, the DMs themselves don't prove much, however, when you assess them more closely,

11:25.120 --> 11:30.960
I'd argue they make Che look worse, mainly because there are multiple DMs in which Slazo seems to be

11:30.960 --> 11:35.440
desperately asking for these people who have made these claims, and although I completely understand

11:35.440 --> 11:41.520
why the anonymity of victims who haven't gone public yet needs to be protected, there was an evasiveness

11:41.520 --> 11:47.120
about her answers that made me very uncomfortable. After numerous amounts of questions, and lack of answers,

11:47.120 --> 11:51.920
Che changes the topic completely to the damage that he had caused, and it just felt dishonest,

11:51.920 --> 11:57.120
because alright, if you say it publicly, I can see you're trying to present reasonability to the audience,

11:57.120 --> 12:01.200
however there's no reason to say that in this conversation, it's just Slazo.

12:01.200 --> 12:06.240
Who knows what he's done regardless, she had no reason to present reasonability, she could have just vented

12:06.240 --> 12:10.800
that what he did was wrong, but the fact that she tried to play the I heard things about you card,

12:10.800 --> 12:15.520
and then defaulting when Slazo tried to ask further, seemed very suspicious.

12:15.520 --> 12:20.960
It felt disingenuous to me, which is what inspired me to reach out to Slazo, it felt like she knew

12:20.960 --> 12:26.800
the nothing Slazo had done was as terrible as she framed it, and was trying to look for justification

12:26.800 --> 12:31.840
to release these claims when it just wasn't there, while still exaggerating what happened.

12:31.840 --> 12:36.240
And honestly, I didn't really want to speak to someone who had possibly done terrible things,

12:36.240 --> 12:40.880
they provoke an emotional reaction from me and people know my personal history with it,

12:40.880 --> 12:46.560
but it seemed like so many people had preemptively condemned him for something that just wasn't as it seemed,

12:46.560 --> 12:53.600
and I felt he could use a bit of advice, after all, it was advice that would only work if he was truly innocent.

12:53.600 --> 12:58.080
At the end of the day, if you're a popular creator, and you're publicly called out,

12:58.080 --> 13:03.760
it is extremely important that you can defend yourself, these are allegations that will follow you around

13:03.760 --> 13:08.480
because many people will look up your name, someone will recognise your face, it is a matter that extends

13:08.480 --> 13:13.200
into your private life. Whether that defence takes a few days or a couple years sometimes,

13:13.200 --> 13:19.280
these things will take some time to consolidate, just don't rush a statement, or don't try and cut something halfway,

13:19.280 --> 13:22.880
or else people will just think you're trying to get away with it by downplaying it.

13:22.880 --> 13:28.480
By promising that he'd be responding further but not saying too much, he didn't let people take his response apart,

13:28.480 --> 13:32.000
and this gave him maximum scope for a full response.

13:32.000 --> 13:37.360
I wanted to make a video regarding the situation, um, as of a couple weeks ago,

13:37.360 --> 13:41.200
some of you might be wondering why it took so long to make this response.

13:41.200 --> 13:46.240
I've spoken about the aesthetics of his response in a previous video, so I won't go in it too deep,

13:46.240 --> 13:51.600
but there's a lot of points to be taken away, nonetheless relating specifically to the situations in question.

13:51.600 --> 13:57.520
One thing that Slazo couldn't really dispute was the actual content of the DMs, however there was a lot he could dispute,

13:57.520 --> 14:01.200
and we'll discuss how much the DM content was actually compromised.

14:01.200 --> 14:04.880
But we'll look at the video for now. There are two separate things he could do,

14:04.880 --> 14:12.000
firstly present a perspective that makes his story look legitimate, or go the extra mile and disprove the opposing perspective.

14:12.000 --> 14:19.840
Although Che provided DMs, as noted they were much more to construct an image of a character that would imply he's capable of doing those acts,

14:19.840 --> 14:22.640
there was no real evidence with direct reference.

14:22.640 --> 14:28.560
So firstly, Slazo goes in for the anecdotal evidence, he doesn't directly contradict every story,

14:28.560 --> 14:34.880
but he does manage to provide enough evidence to show that some of these stories aren't exactly as they were presented.

14:34.880 --> 14:44.640
She pulls my hand down and says to touch her, which is a pretty long way from how she portrays it in her version of the story.

14:44.640 --> 14:49.360
In fact, she was actually the one who brought up the entire idea of doing anything in the cinema.

14:49.360 --> 14:55.200
It was her idea and I had no reason to believe she wasn't as in on this as I was.

14:55.200 --> 15:03.600
But I do have plenty of evidence from very early on in the relationship where she clearly made no intention to wait until 16.

15:03.600 --> 15:07.760
That was never clear to me, I never got that impression and I don't know why she's saying that.

15:07.760 --> 15:14.400
She also mentions later in the post that she's never been in a relationship before, this isn't the impression that I was under.

15:14.400 --> 15:21.200
I was under the impression from these screenshots here that she's had at least two boyfriends and one girlfriend before we ever met.

15:21.200 --> 15:28.240
This is important because none of the stories were proven necessarily, so the fact that Slazo could at least provide contradiction for some of them

15:28.240 --> 15:33.360
was enough to undermine a key factor necessary to Che's testimony, credibility.

15:33.360 --> 15:37.200
On one hand, Slazo could have straight up denied these claims and left it there,

15:37.200 --> 15:42.400
but the evidence he provided actually showed that Che had not presented these claims in good faith.

15:42.400 --> 15:47.440
Probably the most incriminating factor was that the evidence that he provided was DM related,

15:47.440 --> 15:54.160
and given the fact that Che clearly went through the DMs fairly meticulously to collect as much evidence against Slazo as possible,

15:54.160 --> 16:00.000
it seems she must have avoided a lot of DMs that would show her as not being as helpless as she framed herself as.

16:00.000 --> 16:06.480
Memories can be clouded and inaccurate, but the problem was the memory had become so biased that for many people,

16:06.480 --> 16:11.280
whether Slazo intended to or not showed the claims as released in bad faith.

16:11.280 --> 16:16.640
The same DMs that had incriminated Slazo a few weeks later had suddenly exonerated him.

16:16.640 --> 16:24.640
But previous to these messages, I'd mentioned something, a complaint I had that I probably should have kept to myself,

16:24.640 --> 16:32.400
it was... it's embarrassing for her, and she's saying that she wasn't too keen on doing that thing in the first place,

16:32.400 --> 16:38.320
and now she's embarrassed. Anyway, around here she crops out around 11 minutes of conversation between us,

16:38.320 --> 16:42.560
where I apologize and try to get her side and understand how she feels.

16:43.520 --> 16:47.200
I wasn't very good at it, but I tried.

16:47.200 --> 16:51.200
In the video where she's scrolling through her messages here to prove that they're real,

16:51.200 --> 16:57.520
she also goes nearly up to where I apologize and try to understand her point of view, but then quickly scrolls down.

17:01.200 --> 17:06.000
Ultimately, what made it look the worst for Che was the situation regarding the DMs.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.160
This was arguably the most incriminating interaction that she had published,

17:10.160 --> 17:14.480
yet she still withheld 10 minutes of conversation without any information.

17:14.480 --> 17:17.200
This is content that could not have been merely missed.

17:17.200 --> 17:23.440
This brought every claim into contention, and gave Slazo the chance to craft the image from his perspective,

17:23.440 --> 17:26.320
and he knew that he messed up, so he owned up.

17:26.320 --> 17:32.480
This put him in a position where he was able to apologize but simultaneously from a sympathetic position,

17:32.480 --> 17:35.280
as the subject of a smear campaign in a way.

17:35.280 --> 17:38.800
I think there's some legitimate criticism here, you know, something has happened,

17:38.800 --> 17:43.680
and Slazo may have acted inappropriately, but we'll discuss the problems with this in a bit.

18:05.280 --> 18:10.880
about that um she is is very much on board with it with the messages from the time where it actually

18:10.880 --> 18:14.800
happened and the way she talks about it then is very different from the way she talks about it in

18:14.800 --> 18:20.800
hindsight she also mentions me taking off her bra while she's crying firstly i would never do this

18:20.800 --> 18:26.720
if i ever suspected that she didn't want any advance i was making i would stop and also the way

18:26.720 --> 18:32.400
she talks about it in the messages from the time gives the impression that i i wasn't even

18:32.400 --> 18:38.000
intentionally trying to take off her bra which i wasn't this situation by this point bothered me

18:38.000 --> 18:43.440
a lot because allegations shouldn't be botched and they were here with the assumptions that the

18:43.440 --> 18:48.000
allegations were purposely misleading which given what we've observed today would be hard to deny

18:48.000 --> 18:52.880
it undermined any legitimate criticism that may have been warranted but also showed that this was

18:52.880 --> 18:58.080
a situation best left private it was clear from both statements the parties involved had met up

18:58.080 --> 19:02.960
and resolved this as people and although the idea that maybe one of them was manipulating the other

19:02.960 --> 19:07.120
to think that it was all right seems to be a possibility it seems to me that both of these

19:07.120 --> 19:11.680
people have been influenced by the distance placed between them i do have texts from the time that

19:11.680 --> 19:16.720
proved the general tone it it felt very comfortable and i felt that she was completely fine with me by

19:16.720 --> 19:21.520
this point i felt that her past was behind us and we were just putting the final nail in the coffin

19:21.520 --> 19:26.480
by meeting up i really thought this was the case where she says how are you how are you feeling

19:26.480 --> 19:30.880
about it all and i said it's nice it's like a weight's been lifted yeah it's great how are

19:30.880 --> 19:35.120
you feeling about the stuff we talked about towards the end here she's referring to being

19:35.120 --> 19:39.680
friends in the future and maybe getting back together at some point that's what this is

19:39.680 --> 19:44.960
referring to oh like the future and stuff yeah um i feel the same as you really would be really nice

19:44.960 --> 19:51.120
to be friends again for now obviously it's nothing definitive it's nothing concrete but there's that

19:51.120 --> 19:55.280
so take whatever conclusion you will from that believe it or not i've been in a fair share of

19:55.280 --> 20:00.560
drama and conflict in my time i have people who i haven't liked on a personal basis however meeting

20:00.560 --> 20:06.080
them in person often reminds me that these people are mostly decent no one's perfect and if i thought

20:06.080 --> 20:11.200
someone was then i'd probably be a bit more suspicious honestly flaws always exist sometimes

20:11.200 --> 20:15.760
they're just a bit more well hidden than others and in spite of these flaws i can share many

20:15.760 --> 20:21.200
positive experiences with a person even if i have bad memories with them too i wouldn't expect two

20:21.200 --> 20:26.240
people like slather and che to ever be particularly close but it's important to remember how separation

20:26.240 --> 20:31.200
might affect your judgment of a person it was clear that it reached a point that che was under

20:31.200 --> 20:36.000
the impression that slather was a person deserving to suffer to the point where exaggeration was

20:36.000 --> 20:40.560
considered fair game i guess the thing i'm most confused about in this whole thing is

20:42.000 --> 20:47.520
why why would she lie why would she why would she say that she'd never been in a relationship before

20:47.520 --> 20:54.400
never kissed before intended to wait until 16 and twist the truth of what happened in person and

20:54.400 --> 21:00.400
make it and make out like she never wanted to do anything and this wasn't a two-way thing especially

21:00.400 --> 21:06.000
at the beginning it it paints a very black and white picture of me being the predator and her

21:06.000 --> 21:13.680
being the prey it cuts out all nuance of me not knowing what i'm doing and being an idiot which

21:13.680 --> 21:18.240
obviously doesn't excuse what i've said and you know how i've made her feel but

21:20.800 --> 21:25.840
it's a very condemning picture that she's painted and the things she said and the things that she's

21:25.840 --> 21:32.240
implied that i've done can can very well follow me for life it's never fair game with all the

21:32.240 --> 21:37.520
community backing she had falsifying claims that could be disproved with such unbelievably risky

21:37.520 --> 21:42.080
business it wasn't a case of possible perspective with reasonable doubt it was a case where she

21:42.080 --> 21:46.960
actively omitted content and expected that somehow that would help falsifying claims is

21:46.960 --> 21:52.160
never a good idea in the instance that slazo is a predator well congratulations you've let a

21:52.160 --> 21:56.960
predator get away and if he's not well that's terrible you just tried to end someone's career

21:56.960 --> 22:02.000
over false allegations in the instagram conversation that che and i had before this all went live

22:02.000 --> 22:07.520
which is now public record um she expresses concerns that i've been weird with other people

22:07.520 --> 22:13.760
and that she's concerned i'll do it again um she doesn't specify who despite me asking a few times

22:13.760 --> 22:18.480
and and she also says that she's concerned i have stan accounts and people who are probably willing

22:18.480 --> 22:23.040
to send me things for my attention um i said that i've never taken advantage of this and

22:23.680 --> 22:29.680
i even offered her my login to prove that i've never done this and wouldn't immediately after

22:29.680 --> 22:35.600
offering my login the problem quickly becomes more that i didn't take responsibility and that i need

22:35.600 --> 22:43.760
to suffer consequences for my actions um yeah the the reason for it going public quickly changes

22:43.760 --> 22:48.560
and yes the whole twitlonger was released under the premise that he had been continuing this trend

22:48.560 --> 22:53.360
of behavior but it just seems that he hasn't been no additional evidence has come forward suggesting

22:53.360 --> 22:58.160
that he has and it seems strange if someone's prepared to allege that he's been continuing this

22:58.160 --> 23:02.480
behavior as reason to come forward regarding this then that should be part of the evidence

23:02.480 --> 23:06.480
if you're implying that publicizing your experience wouldn't be necessary if he wasn't

23:06.480 --> 23:11.600
continuing this behavior then at that point with your own credibility in serious disrepute it would

23:11.600 --> 23:15.840
be incumbent on these new people to come forward to imply that he might still be a threat but

23:15.840 --> 23:20.080
unfortunately if they exist and they're not prepared to speak up and many people felt at

23:20.080 --> 23:24.720
this point the original claims held no water whatsoever and with the release of slanzo's

23:24.720 --> 23:29.920
video angry people flooded over to deal a torrent of criticism towards che but it was soon about to

23:29.920 --> 23:39.680
be much bigger than her there had been discussion about the actual formulation of the twitlonger in

23:39.680 --> 23:42.880
question because normally when someone makes claims you'd expect them to be the curator of

23:42.880 --> 23:47.200
these comments however in this situation it seems like there were a few more people involved this

23:47.200 --> 23:50.800
was implied when a couple people commented that they'd been involved but this didn't come under

23:50.800 --> 23:55.920
the microscope until after slazo's response after slazo's response many felt like he had made a

23:55.920 --> 24:00.160
compelling case for himself and people felt that providing the situation remained as it was that

24:00.160 --> 24:04.160
he was entitled to an apology or at least a retraction from those who supported the original

24:04.160 --> 24:08.880
twitlonger i don't think people had a particularly high bar because those who had endorsed one opinion

24:08.880 --> 24:13.440
shouldn't remain supporting that opinion if they now see it as false in case new fans come along

24:13.440 --> 24:17.440
and receive a false impression an apology or attraction is one of the ways that this can be

24:17.440 --> 24:21.920
resolved however to many people surprised a few creators involved decided that actually they

24:21.920 --> 24:26.720
didn't want to apologize to slazo initially the people who put out public statements were quite

24:26.720 --> 24:31.440
blues dank dolan dark westerner i'm alex and king annie although these responses were different

24:31.440 --> 24:36.480
shades of tone many found these responses inadequate or misleading some of these responses

24:36.480 --> 24:40.880
are not worth talking about such as quites because he just said he wanted to wait for more information

24:40.880 --> 24:46.080
which is completely fair however there were a few that did strike me as slightly off well first take

24:46.080 --> 24:51.200
a look at king annie someone who i have met and found thoroughly pleasant however the situation

24:51.200 --> 24:55.920
didn't do so great for her firstly she had this monumental take that quotes innocent people don't

24:55.920 --> 25:00.240
stay quiet for this long a day before slazo released his response and then in response to

25:00.240 --> 25:05.840
slazo's video decided to say this a lot of people were pretty focused on alex's take which we will

25:05.840 --> 25:10.240
discuss later but i do think this one is significantly worse michael is still guilty for

25:10.240 --> 25:15.760
what he did in the past yes we are all guilty for what we've done in the past the question was

25:15.760 --> 25:21.120
what exactly happened he did admit to some things most notably a quote complaint he had but it

25:21.120 --> 25:25.360
would be incumbent on the people involved to try and exactly pinpoint what the context for

25:25.360 --> 25:29.680
this situation is because he said himself that he didn't want to mention it specifically

25:29.680 --> 25:34.800
so you have the chance to clarify what this actually was and you didn't no one is glossing

25:34.800 --> 25:40.000
over it it's just people can't go after him until they know the specific context until then people

25:40.000 --> 25:45.040
will be looking towards you for elaboration and then we have this gaslighting comment which i

25:45.040 --> 25:49.680
found rather strange gaslighting is when you make a person doubt their own experiences through

25:49.680 --> 25:54.320
manipulation but i don't think she knows what that means also i find it strange that her language

25:54.320 --> 25:58.880
implies the fact that she can label this as gaslighting suddenly means it's manipulation

25:58.880 --> 26:03.760
and not just manipulation on its own terms it's a strange way to express your position it's like

26:03.760 --> 26:09.280
she thinks that people just identify the word manipulation rather than the underlying processes

26:09.280 --> 26:13.600
people aren't the smartest sometimes but they're a bit smarter than that then she goes for the

26:13.600 --> 26:18.400
mentality argument and yes there was a responsibility on slazo that he failed as a

26:18.400 --> 26:23.200
boyfriend there was an age gap frankly put more weight on him but the problem was that it seemed

26:23.200 --> 26:27.520
that they were both ignorant in a way that would make their judgment poor other factors like

26:27.520 --> 26:33.120
experience also have to be taken into account secondly that's not how i remember it is not a

26:33.120 --> 26:38.400
shit rebuttal at all without the evidence sometimes it's the only rebuttal and it's the only way people

26:38.400 --> 26:43.760
can defend themselves when they have unsubstantiated claims made against them they cannot directly

26:43.760 --> 26:48.080
disprove then we have the final statement that annie makes which brings it back to this notion

26:48.640 --> 26:53.120
mistakes and it's okay if you want to stand by your friend i completely understand that

26:53.120 --> 26:57.920
that's your choice but these aren't mistakes example in the original twitlonger che states

26:57.920 --> 27:02.480
that this was her first relationship in an attempt to make her perspective seem more innocent this is

27:02.480 --> 27:06.720
not a passive omission this is not something that she could forget it is an active lie that

27:06.720 --> 27:11.760
was contradicted by slazo in his response these mistakes are all over the twitlonger and you can

27:11.760 --> 27:16.240
stick up for a character in public but you should have a very stern talking to her in private because

27:16.240 --> 27:20.320
given the twitlonger have been in the works for around a month and you took credit for helping

27:20.320 --> 27:24.960
her you really should have made sure there wasn't room for such mistakes she ends by saying she

27:24.960 --> 27:29.680
hopes he can get some therapy issues that as he has presented the argument seem to be resolved

27:29.680 --> 27:34.400
as said i met annie after the statement and she completely defined my expectations i really

27:34.400 --> 27:39.200
enjoyed her company and she may genuinely believe this but if she does then i'd really recommend

27:39.200 --> 27:43.200
withholding judgment of situations in the future not because she's a friend but because she's a

27:43.200 --> 27:48.960
public figure and that sort of exercise of power is obviously going to have a huge influence on

27:48.960 --> 27:53.200
someone's judgments plenty of people have spoken to me and said that they think che was manipulated

27:53.200 --> 27:57.280
and i think that's very possible too even unintentionally the sort of pressure from

27:57.280 --> 28:02.160
such powerful figures to put a statement out would be crushing chase twitlonger is not the

28:02.160 --> 28:07.040
sort of thing that people can continue backing even if it's just for the sake of personal pride

28:07.040 --> 28:13.120
even if you want to continue backing che as a person even if you don't like slazo even if you

28:13.120 --> 28:18.960
find him creepy there's such a dynamic of power in this situation that shouldn't have been used

28:18.960 --> 28:23.520
wiesner was the other person who made noteworthy comments in response to this situation and

28:23.520 --> 28:28.160
honestly when breaking his comments down they're not that different to annie's okay so i just

28:28.160 --> 28:34.080
watched slazo's video his response to his ex-girlfriend che's accusation that he was

28:34.080 --> 28:40.720
uh emotionally and perhaps even sexually abusive and my conclusion is that he is just gonna have

28:40.720 --> 28:45.680
to learn from his mistakes i mean he fucked up it looks like he's still gonna fuck up again

28:45.680 --> 28:49.840
he gives me a lot of impressions that he's definitely manipulator he even owns up to it in

28:49.840 --> 28:54.960
his video he definitely seems like the person to to gaslight his partner make them think that

28:54.960 --> 28:58.800
things happen differently from what they remember in order to manipulate them and make them

28:58.800 --> 29:05.520
apologize for something that wasn't even their fault um i don't want to believe that che is just

29:05.520 --> 29:13.760
an outright liar but there was this one clip that always stuck out to me slazo did admit that he was

29:13.760 --> 29:19.600
controlling he used the word controlling he didn't say manipulative now all the youtubers are

29:19.600 --> 29:25.120
manipulative that's how we got to where we are we manipulate an audience day to day for money i mean

29:25.120 --> 29:29.840
like this is what we do i know it has a negative connotation to it but it just is what it is this

29:29.840 --> 29:35.360
was not a good thing to say firstly equivocating being controlling and being manipulative and then

29:35.360 --> 29:41.360
equivocating being manipulative in the past tense and being manipulative in the present tense

29:41.360 --> 29:47.920
we made two huge logical jumps to justify a point of view that we cannot be remotely sure of at all

29:47.920 --> 29:52.640
to be honest i think his statement wasn't the worst even though he made that stupid comment

29:52.640 --> 29:56.880
about people being manipulative because he did seem to acknowledge that a lot of the information

29:56.880 --> 30:01.200
was wrong and it should have remained private but his opinion still just seems to be parroting

30:01.200 --> 30:05.520
other people without knowing what those words actually mean it seems like a lot of people

30:05.520 --> 30:11.040
involved were just trying to make what he admitted appear worse than what he actually did without

30:11.040 --> 30:16.400
proving it was a lot worse despite having the opportunity and people saw through it and people

30:16.400 --> 30:23.840
were asking for more and well they got more but not exactly in the way they'd hope all right i'm

30:23.840 --> 30:29.200
gonna head to the con in a second of sunburn madam's apple look like a lobster

30:32.080 --> 30:36.560
i'm in a lot of pain we go again see you all soon

30:38.560 --> 30:42.640
the problem is that when people started making statements like these people saw it as them

30:42.640 --> 30:47.520
trying to cover their backsides and for justified reasons the people involved all knew che and if

30:47.520 --> 30:51.600
che had more evidence that she was prepared to release other people involved were either better

30:51.600 --> 30:55.520
off staying silent or at least informing the audience that there would be more evidence to

30:55.520 --> 31:00.880
come however they spoke as if this was it at least for now and people picked up on that one

31:00.880 --> 31:05.920
of the most confusing things for me as a viewer was that people who had openly reacted with such

31:05.920 --> 31:10.560
shock and surprise when these allegations were first released when many of these claims were

31:10.560 --> 31:15.680
counted or disproved suddenly changed their tune as if they knew he was a terrible person anyway

31:15.680 --> 31:19.840
and the fact that the claims were falsified oh that doesn't matter as someone who might be a

31:19.840 --> 31:24.720
friend to someone like slazo as someone who was not present in the original relationship as

31:24.720 --> 31:30.240
someone who felt the shock and surprised i'd be relieved when he put out his response but this

31:30.240 --> 31:35.680
was the sort of response that makes people think there's another motive something else behind it

31:35.680 --> 31:42.000
i'm alex was another person who honestly i didn't expect to be involved and i really wish he wasn't

31:42.000 --> 31:46.240
i've known him for ages and he's been having a rough time recently so i don't want to give him

31:46.240 --> 31:50.880
grief he has apologized since but it would be dishonest for me to pretend he doesn't exist

31:50.880 --> 31:54.880
he was one of the people who decided that the public deserved a response and whether they did

31:54.880 --> 32:01.120
or not it probably wasn't the one that alex should have provided hello guys um i i want to try and

32:01.120 --> 32:06.400
put this in as concise way as possible uh but this is my response to michael and slazo's video

32:06.400 --> 32:10.800
uh there's a limit on this so if i'm brushing other things i'm trying not to i just want to

32:10.800 --> 32:17.120
put everything in here in a place that is easy for people to get to um i want to make a statement

32:17.120 --> 32:21.920
because of the fact that obviously i came out and supported che when she posted her to it longer

32:21.920 --> 32:27.840
um and obviously now michael's video has come out where he's debunked um some of the things

32:27.840 --> 32:32.400
that were put in there my problem with michael was him admitting to doing things that he knew

32:32.400 --> 32:37.760
che may not have wanted to do and being incredibly forceful and almost demanding which he admitted

32:37.760 --> 32:42.960
to doing in his video which for me is still disgusting um i don't believe he's innocent

32:42.960 --> 32:48.320
i i don't think he's innocent at all uh che may not also be innocent and i may have hid stuff and

32:48.320 --> 32:53.840
and used jokes to try and maybe push a certain agenda but at the same time the stuff that michael

32:53.840 --> 32:57.600
admitted to is stuff that makes me not want to be friends with somebody who is capable of doing

32:57.600 --> 33:02.640
those things once again it felt like he'd read a tldr of the video and attempted to derive some

33:02.640 --> 33:07.840
conclusions from there it wasn't a good response and admittedly it did confuse me to an extent

33:07.840 --> 33:13.440
i'm alex has been covering youtube drama for ages and surely he'd know the do's and don'ts responses

33:13.440 --> 33:17.600
in an ideal scenario if there was no more information the best thing to do is to say

33:17.600 --> 33:22.000
that you were misled and apologize you don't have to be friends with the person you don't even have

33:22.000 --> 33:27.040
to believe that they're a good person but you have to say what you got wrong alex spoke like someone

33:27.040 --> 33:32.480
who knew more information was preparing for more information yet as mentioned earlier if there was

33:32.480 --> 33:37.280
more information the best thing would be just say nothing at all or to tell people to hold their

33:37.280 --> 33:42.480
horses on the other hand i thought there must be more to this because someone wouldn't pick such an

33:42.480 --> 33:48.640
obviously bad response when they've been covering responses since the dawn of time but even then

33:48.640 --> 33:53.040
putting out an awful response receiving a little backlash only to wait a few weeks and suddenly

33:53.040 --> 33:57.520
drop some evidence that will turn the case on its head is a terrible way to go about it as well

33:57.520 --> 34:02.240
because people will just be pissed off and ask why on earth you didn't just say there's more to come

34:02.240 --> 34:05.840
this gives me the impression that no one was actually certain of additional evidence to be

34:05.840 --> 34:09.840
released but was hopeful that there would be some killer response that would make their critics look

34:09.840 --> 34:15.600
like idiots sexual misconduct allegations aren't about the gotcha moments with all this in mind i

34:15.600 --> 34:20.400
put out a tweet venting my frustration about the handling of the situation and in light of this

34:20.400 --> 34:24.720
some people involved reached out to me in private regarding the claims but what they said is there

34:24.720 --> 34:29.120
would be a lot more additional evidence and claimants with a high level of certainty this

34:29.120 --> 34:33.440
caused me a lot of confusion because as aforementioned with their current statements

34:33.440 --> 34:38.880
people involved were about to receive a lot of criticism but who was the main recipient of the

34:38.880 --> 34:43.840
sites of the ravenous commentator our friend alex people were not happy about his response in

34:43.840 --> 34:49.440
particular but why well as noted earlier he is a commentator who is renowned for his takes on

34:49.440 --> 34:54.240
youtube drama in fact many people view him as one of the most credible commentators in the community

34:54.240 --> 34:59.040
and therefore his fumbling was a huge stain on his takes this was brought forward in tandem with

34:59.040 --> 35:03.440
his james charles take which many people criticized him about honestly i thought his

35:03.440 --> 35:07.760
original video was a fairly natural reaction to a situation that seemed pretty different to the

35:07.760 --> 35:11.840
truth and to be fair he did actually apologize for that take although some people felt that

35:11.840 --> 35:16.080
his original video should have been removed and that was a justified position too that i agree

35:16.080 --> 35:20.800
with these back-to-back situations someone who people seem to have much higher standards for

35:20.800 --> 35:25.040
made the criticism a lot more stinging on top of this there are people who have some pretty

35:25.040 --> 35:29.360
personal grudges against him two of those creators being kavos and keemstar the kavos

35:29.360 --> 35:34.160
feud has been a long personal conflict originating way back from when kavos made a video on wild

35:34.160 --> 35:39.680
spartans i'm alex's then friend a while later i'm alex then clapped back with a video of his own

35:39.680 --> 35:45.440
which kavos replied to when keemstar shafted kavos over a dispute regarding drama channels i'm alex

35:45.440 --> 35:50.080
actually intervened and defended kavos which seemed to put the conflict to rest with kavos

35:50.080 --> 35:54.320
even suggesting that he was happy that alex's channel was doing well however this will fall

35:54.320 --> 35:58.080
apart when both the creators appeared to intend to meet each other but never did

35:58.080 --> 36:02.160
with alex claiming that he tried to meet him multiple times and kavos saying that this just

36:02.160 --> 36:07.600
wasn't true this new situation gave kavos a whole new round of ammunition to take aim at alex with

36:07.600 --> 36:14.160
the backing of keemstar what he's done i think we can all agree is just inexcusable and there

36:14.160 --> 36:19.360
needs to be some sort of consequence for that you can't just go around doing this be a commentary

36:19.440 --> 36:25.040
youtube over 1.6 million subs and do that how can anyone trust him again how can he have any

36:25.040 --> 36:30.240
credibility that is what you need as a commentator how can he be a commentator after all of that

36:30.240 --> 36:35.600
keemstar on the other hand has hated alex fairly consistently for a long time from a situation

36:35.600 --> 36:40.720
rooting back to keemstar's beta podcast a podcast featuring keem fellow british commentator

36:40.720 --> 36:46.160
colossal is crazy and drama streamer tommy c after a conversation alex reported that keemstar

36:46.160 --> 36:50.480
was the instigating factor for its demise he made a twitter video when he knew clown

36:50.480 --> 36:55.920
couldn't defend himself accusing him of asking for more money and accusing clown of refusing

36:55.920 --> 37:00.880
to cooperate when in all reality it was king keemstar since claimed that alex is a social

37:00.880 --> 37:06.480
climber who will only use people for his opportunistic game last night you said the

37:06.480 --> 37:14.240
reason why i don't like you is because you don't like me that's that's retarded you're actually

37:14.240 --> 37:20.560
retarded look dude the reason why i don't like you is because you uploaded a video and you made

37:20.560 --> 37:26.160
up a bunch of lives about me that was the start of it um then you kept doing this repeatedly then

37:26.160 --> 37:30.720
you started fucking leeching off people and using them to kind of get where you were ironically this

37:30.720 --> 37:35.840
situation spurred members of the community on so much that keemstar and tommy c long opposed to

37:35.840 --> 37:40.160
each other put their differences aside and reunited with colossal to record an episode

37:40.160 --> 37:45.520
of the baited podcast relating specifically to this situation if the community all starts hating

37:45.520 --> 37:51.040
pewdiepie one day he would hate pewdiepie right if the community starts loving pewdiepie he loves

37:51.040 --> 37:58.400
pewdiepie like dude this guy is a flip-flopping piece of i hate him he's not a real person he's

37:58.400 --> 38:03.280
not a real person with real opinions and real thoughts boogie does the same thing always goes

38:03.280 --> 38:08.640
with the popular vote and he'll retract his opinion in a heartbeat well his heart beats

38:08.720 --> 38:13.840
pretty fucking fast to be honest with the clear evidence that there was some fuel in the tank

38:13.840 --> 38:18.720
other smaller creators jumped on the opportunity to upload videos on i'm alex claiming either his

38:18.720 --> 38:23.840
disloyalty to slazo or his hypocrisy regarding situations the reason he had become the target

38:23.840 --> 38:28.400
was mostly circumstantial nothing he'd done at this stage was different to many other creators

38:28.400 --> 38:32.400
and i was concerned that people would forget about the greater points that were to be made

38:32.400 --> 38:37.440
my concerns were confirmed when alex unwisely decided to speak to some of these smaller creators

38:37.440 --> 38:41.600
in a private call which would honestly not remain private for long he allegedly disclosed

38:41.600 --> 38:46.400
multiple details regarding the situation these creators then decided that they would do what

38:46.400 --> 39:03.840
they know best talk about it and oh dear oh dear oh dear in this call it is alleged that all sorts

39:03.840 --> 39:08.800
of information was divulged the prime recipient of this information was a youtuber slash streamer

39:08.800 --> 39:13.760
named nicholas diorio who then went and passed on alex's numerous comments to various creators

39:13.760 --> 39:19.840
some who were directly referenced and others for video purposes i have no clue why alex thought

39:19.840 --> 39:23.840
this was a good idea but it wasn't people are always nicer in conversation than when they're

39:23.840 --> 39:27.840
publicly talking about you and it seems that alex was under the impression that if he told them

39:27.840 --> 39:32.880
aside they'd be a bit softer on him in public unfortunately that was not the case diorio took

39:32.880 --> 39:37.440
alex's comments regarding slazo straight to slazo and conducted an interview in which he asked

39:37.440 --> 39:42.880
slazo his opinions on these takes alex claims that you had been rough and forceful with a girl

39:42.880 --> 39:47.280
while staying with him he claimed you were completely sober and forcefully getting this

39:47.280 --> 39:52.640
woman drunk allegedly alex had to step in and remove the girl from the situation as you begun

39:52.640 --> 39:58.080
kissing and sent her home in an uber alex also claimed he told you we don't do that shit around

39:58.080 --> 40:06.640
here man and bullied you for the next few days yes um yeah this was really confusing to hear

40:06.640 --> 40:14.240
honestly um this is a complete um embellishment of what happened he also took comments about

40:14.240 --> 40:18.640
other people to the parties mentioned and informed them too we'll return to this point later but it

40:18.640 --> 40:23.680
was basically the release of a pandora's box of information into the community and provided plenty

40:23.680 --> 40:28.400
more content for creators to nor on one of these creators was turkey tom who for legal reasons i

40:28.400 --> 40:33.680
must disclose isn't actually a turkey and why is your name turkey tom but you're not a turkey

40:33.680 --> 40:38.240
all right if you really wanted to pull this off and brand it right you'd be a fucking turkey

40:38.240 --> 40:42.720
he was making a video on the slazo situation covering the various responses and one of the

40:42.720 --> 40:47.040
people who had been regularly mentioned in private but not so much in public was a creator by the

40:47.040 --> 40:51.920
name of hyojin it was claimed that among other things alex had implied various facts about hyojin

40:51.920 --> 40:56.000
in a call with oreo which were then publicized subsequently although i cannot confirm whether

40:56.000 --> 40:59.840
alex actually said this many people seem to believe that he did given their own personal

40:59.840 --> 41:04.640
relationships with him and some even publicly reacted with hostility when a certain situation

41:04.640 --> 41:09.360
that we'll talk about later transpired these claims also seem to be unsubstantiated and many

41:09.360 --> 41:14.160
others involved said they simply weren't true hyojin is a creator slash artist who is closely

41:14.160 --> 41:18.640
associated with che she hasn't been too vocal about the situation however have been involved

41:18.640 --> 41:22.560
in assisting the release of the twitlong behind the scenes she was named and saved and what

41:22.560 --> 41:27.120
happens when a creator is called out is that often people like to go one step further and see what

41:27.120 --> 41:31.920
other shady behavior they may be partaking in when hyojin's name was dragged out under the sun

41:31.920 --> 41:37.920
a lot followed a lot of offensive dms a lot of testimonies from people who had negative experiences

41:37.920 --> 41:42.560
and some further rumors some of this stuff was definitely warranting criticism for example an

41:42.560 --> 41:47.440
nsfw blog in which she posted explicit art of people from within the community some of these

41:47.440 --> 41:52.160
people were quite underage and others definitely didn't consent to it however other claims were

41:52.160 --> 41:57.440
slightly more shaky and also rather invasive in a person's private life so where does turkey tom

41:57.440 --> 42:01.840
come into this well he uploaded a video on the situation in which he addresses the involvement

42:01.840 --> 42:06.400
of many individuals and one of them is hyojin this was not too long after the information of

42:06.400 --> 42:11.440
her involvement had been floated from the private call besides the multiple other allegations

42:11.440 --> 42:16.560
regarding her behavior in tom's video he made some very fair points that would deserve criticism for

42:16.560 --> 42:21.040
the parties involved however when going through hyojin's involvement although mostly focusing

42:21.040 --> 42:25.840
on the content that was fairly verifiable he divulged two pieces of psa that were probably

42:25.840 --> 42:29.840
rather inappropriate the first was a rumor regarding an affair that should not have gone

42:29.840 --> 42:34.560
in a public video and the second was a set of allegations regarding animal maltreatment

42:34.560 --> 42:39.200
relating back to the claim by an anonymous source that she was not just unpleasant but had a habit

42:39.200 --> 42:44.960
of picking up a dog and placing it on its back now i cannot comment on the verifiability of these

42:44.960 --> 42:49.920
claims but the problem was the second claim was so outlandish and ridiculous that it immediately

42:49.920 --> 42:54.800
caught the most attention despite arguably being the least relevant now normally with such a claim

42:54.800 --> 42:59.840
we would think about it critically innocent until proven guilty however people were so caught up in

42:59.840 --> 43:04.480
the sentiment of criticizing kyojin that it was just lumped in there with all the actual other

43:04.480 --> 43:09.040
legitimate criticism and because it is arguably the strangest claim it became the claim that was

43:09.040 --> 43:14.560
referenced the most and ultimately became a focus alongside the already existent criticism of her

43:14.560 --> 43:19.200
content in the situation it finally provoked a response from her however these responses were

43:19.200 --> 43:23.920
not well received because they weren't very good and people continue to lump pressure onto her

43:23.920 --> 43:28.560
creators made additional videos turkey tom made a second video in which he responded to heojin's

43:28.560 --> 43:33.120
comments and provided further elaboration to his points and although there was still attention on

43:33.120 --> 43:38.400
other people involved it's clear that a lot was said about heojin and she became a very easy

43:38.400 --> 43:43.440
target due to her incompetence in dealing with this however it's clear that people had become

43:43.440 --> 43:48.160
too carried away on the basis of some shaky criticism and some character and it was easy

43:48.160 --> 43:53.680
to witness ultimately the sort of mob had turned on heojin and it was becoming very toxic and after

43:53.680 --> 43:58.400
a few days she blacked out her twitter and it was reported she'd attempted to take her own life

43:58.400 --> 44:03.200
fortunately she survived and was hospitalized however this provoked a lot of further conflict

44:03.200 --> 44:07.920
from within the community at first there was an immediate reaction an outpouring of support in the

44:08.000 --> 44:13.440
hashtag love for heojin movement trying to reverse what it had become but soon enough people began

44:13.440 --> 44:17.520
to make more provocative statements maybe people began to turn on those who had rustled up this

44:17.520 --> 44:22.480
scenario stating that they were partly accountable for this terrible situation however in response

44:22.480 --> 44:26.720
to this many of the lead critics asked if the attempt really changed any of the points that

44:26.720 --> 44:30.640
were being made against her it's a tough discussion because both of these points are

44:30.640 --> 44:35.440
extremely sensitive but neither of them are entirely invalid if someone did something

44:35.440 --> 44:40.000
terrible and attempted on their life no it does not change the terrible thing they did

44:40.000 --> 44:44.720
but i also think the point of criticism is to improve someone not drive them off the edge

44:44.720 --> 44:49.520
and mixing in unsubstantiated rumors in there just generally harmed the case that could have

44:49.520 --> 44:55.040
been much more focused on what actually happened and not drive someone's image down as some sort

44:55.040 --> 45:00.000
of dog tipper it's why we should always make our criticism as clear as possible from a personal

45:00.000 --> 45:05.680
perspective we will always provoke some backlash onto a person if we criticize them however firstly

45:05.680 --> 45:10.160
we want to make sure that we don't cause harassment and secondly we don't want to provide

45:10.160 --> 45:14.880
backlash on the basis of false information nonetheless that does not mean that harassment

45:14.880 --> 45:19.360
is accountable to the original critic because there will always be some people who look for

45:19.360 --> 45:24.480
an excuse to harass people regardless and there has to be some level of personal responsibility

45:24.480 --> 45:30.160
for such behavior in this situation i don't think anyone maliciously intended to provoke harassment

45:30.160 --> 45:35.120
nor do i think anyone can singly be blamed for reporting on a lot of this but going in with

45:35.120 --> 45:39.520
outlandish rumors at a time where people saw a lot of the claims as flying regardless of whether

45:39.520 --> 45:44.320
they had wings or not was probably not the best shout try and make sure that what you're basing

45:44.320 --> 45:48.960
your content off is as well founded as they come it doesn't just help the person you may be

45:48.960 --> 45:54.000
criticizing but it helps your case too and prevents this sort of situation coming back today

45:54.000 --> 45:58.960
to tom's credit he has actually made changes to his videos that remove the unsubstantiated claims

45:58.960 --> 46:04.240
and anyone who also did that should receive their fair credit it's an emotional situation and people

46:04.240 --> 46:09.120
do feel really strongly about it i respect that when people made their videos i don't think it

46:09.120 --> 46:14.480
came from a place of ha ha drama let's cash in i genuinely think this mattered to people because

46:14.480 --> 46:19.840
people did feel strongly about being in a position where you would be exposed for something that you

46:19.840 --> 46:25.760
didn't do and you could have your whole career ruined that provoked strong feelings understandably

46:25.760 --> 46:31.200
so however although this was the situation that brought the drama to a halt it was still a very

46:31.200 --> 46:37.120
small part of a very complex puzzle because there were still so many unanswered questions regarding

46:37.120 --> 46:42.320
how and why this happened and what exactly was going on behind the scenes and that's what i want

46:42.320 --> 47:00.080
to discuss now why is arguably the most important question that one can ask because once you find

47:00.080 --> 47:04.640
the underlying roots of a scenario then you might be able to exactly understand the cause for these

47:04.640 --> 47:10.080
situations and hopefully work on avoiding them in the future that's important for anyone involved

47:10.080 --> 47:14.480
at the end of the day the goal is to make sure that anyone who is a threat to those around them

47:14.480 --> 47:19.760
is addressed properly and innocent parties are left alone so that we can elevate victims and

47:19.760 --> 47:24.560
make sure that they have a voice there are many reasons that people have hypothesized how this

47:24.560 --> 47:29.280
has happened one of the more popular theories is that of competition and although it would be

47:29.280 --> 47:34.240
certainly an interesting albeit sinister twist i don't think that is the case i don't think those

47:34.240 --> 47:38.720
creators were threatened by the prospect of another creator covering a similar genre and

47:38.720 --> 47:43.520
slazo wasn't a similar genre to many of the creators involved anyway it would certainly

47:43.520 --> 47:49.440
take a very elaborate plan to take out someone for the mere reason of being competition i also

47:49.440 --> 47:54.480
don't think it's a group conspiracy i don't think that everyone involved in the release of the

47:54.480 --> 47:59.120
statement had malintent it seems plausible that one or two people color the perception of the

47:59.120 --> 48:06.480
party but it seems unlikely that we'll be able to work out exactly who in light of the situation

48:06.480 --> 48:11.760
we've seen a few party members involved openly apologize their involvement this seems like the

48:11.760 --> 48:16.720
right thing to do at this point however it still doesn't really answer why a couple people doubled

48:16.720 --> 48:20.720
down at the time some have stated that they thought they'd heard more stories but it just

48:20.720 --> 48:24.880
seems confusing that if the first claims were disproved they'd stand by these additional

48:24.880 --> 48:29.920
claims and openly call out slazo if they were unsubstantiated which is what they seem like

48:29.920 --> 48:34.640
on top of this a fair few people still defend che's intentions or say that they thought she

48:34.640 --> 48:39.520
genuinely didn't have the idea of leaving out all this evidence and once again although someone may

48:39.520 --> 48:45.280
be genuinely hurt it really can't excuse what happened it really can't change the fact that she

48:45.280 --> 48:50.160
would have had to have gone through all these messages and she didn't just accidentally miss

48:50.160 --> 48:56.800
out 10 minutes of dms it's impossible to really work around it doesn't really excuse what happened

48:56.800 --> 49:02.160
and doesn't really make sense either the fact that someone just accidentally left out 10 minutes of

49:02.160 --> 49:07.840
conversation i can't look inside their soul and completely deduce what was going on which made

49:07.840 --> 49:13.280
so many people desperate to justify that slazo wasn't a good person but given the similarity

49:13.280 --> 49:18.400
of all the responses and the general misuse of terminology it seems like it was just a case of

49:18.400 --> 49:23.280
group think with some people's ignorance taken advantage of by a less than well-meaning actor

49:23.280 --> 49:28.480
perhaps but that's just a theory some people haven't commented further that will be for better

49:28.480 --> 49:33.360
or for worse some people have like westner i love you i don't understand priming's video

49:33.360 --> 49:38.080
makes you sound evil uh yeah it's just some fucking guy some fucking content content vulture

49:38.080 --> 49:43.920
this is yeah i mean what do you expect making video about the drama like a month after it

49:43.920 --> 49:48.720
happens quick point buddy primink isn't a content vulture he's a guy who cares a lot about a

49:48.720 --> 49:53.200
situation that you claim to care about too and the fact that you have the nerve to judge people's

49:53.200 --> 49:57.360
character on the basis of them calling out is pretty rotten if you don't feel like there's

49:57.360 --> 50:01.920
anything more to say then don't say anything more there were also some people claiming that

50:01.920 --> 50:07.120
people at the actual insomnia event knew which i can't say i agree with either even if people were

50:07.120 --> 50:12.000
unsure at the time i don't think they would have invited him over with that knowledge with that

50:12.000 --> 50:16.240
said there were definitely people who have known for a while who were not at the event and that

50:16.240 --> 50:21.600
does bother me because no one thought to tell me or many other people what was going on people know

50:21.600 --> 50:26.480
that there are people there with strong history with sexual misconduct and even when i was told

50:26.480 --> 50:31.680
personally i was still not meant to know and even then if he was a threat people really sat

50:31.680 --> 50:36.320
on this evidence for such an exceptionally long time as if he wasn't going out and about in his

50:36.320 --> 50:42.000
daily life interacting with multiple females it all felt so fine-tuned it was more designed to be

50:42.000 --> 50:46.640
a spectacle than an actual post and that's what bothered a lot of people myself included in my

50:46.640 --> 50:51.120
opinion there have been people trying to get individuals to disassociate from slazo due to

50:51.120 --> 50:55.600
how they perceived his behavior and it reached a person who insisted that they needed to go public

50:55.600 --> 51:00.560
with this information but unfortunately it just wasn't there and you know i do believe that people

51:00.560 --> 51:05.760
act with earnest intent when trying to bring these things to light i will defend many of those people

51:05.760 --> 51:11.120
but the fact is that it took a month to come out with a much less than adequate allegations

51:11.120 --> 51:16.960
embellished with evidence that had clearly not been closely looked at i mean it's infuriating

51:16.960 --> 51:21.280
and it has taken its toll plenty of people have lost subscribers plenty of people haven't been

51:21.280 --> 51:25.760
doing mentally well out of all the drama watching this one was probably the most painful but i felt

51:25.760 --> 51:30.320
it was worth saying something because as someone who saw a lot of it going on in the inside it took

51:30.320 --> 51:35.040
a toll not just on the people directly involved but on a lot of the people around and the

51:35.040 --> 51:39.920
relationships they had i've now heard multiple contradicting statements from people involved

51:39.920 --> 51:45.040
which don't add up people who i believe i could trust i heard them out i believed them and

51:45.040 --> 51:50.800
supported them but since then i've had to take a step back and ask myself who i put my faith in

51:50.800 --> 51:55.440
it's draining it makes me miserable and i'll always stand up for the people who are my friends

51:55.440 --> 52:00.160
if anyone asks me about the intentions of people involved i defend them to the bitter end but there

52:00.160 --> 52:04.080
are some things that never sat right with me throughout this all and nothing has really

52:04.080 --> 52:08.880
righted those feelings of discontent there were people who did not treat those around them like

52:08.880 --> 52:13.520
friends a lot of youtubers should look at the slazo situation and take a long hard look at

52:13.520 --> 52:18.240
themselves and the way they treat their friends as for slazo well i want to take a brief moment

52:18.240 --> 52:22.720
to critique him independently it's clear he's had some problems but i don't think those problems

52:22.720 --> 52:27.040
are problems that he's not been working on and it's clear he acknowledged that he's behaved as

52:27.040 --> 52:32.160
a bad boyfriend in many ways being controlling is a poor show and there are definitely certain

52:32.160 --> 52:36.720
things that he has admitted to that would be worthy of criticism floating the idea that his

52:36.720 --> 52:41.840
girlfriend should take different antidepressants that would aid her sex drive like she said the

52:41.840 --> 52:48.240
thing i didn't go there when she was on a period i suggested at one point that she go off her

52:48.880 --> 52:54.560
antidepressant well i suggested she'd go to another one but at other points i insinuated

52:54.560 --> 53:02.480
that it might be a bad thing that she was on these antidepressants why first her sex drive

53:02.480 --> 53:09.200
yeah like she said oh two so your intention was to amplify it or to decrease it to em to

53:09.760 --> 53:14.560
yeah to amplify it yeah all right that's that's the point against you i would say

53:14.560 --> 53:19.040
it was exceptionally inappropriate and we don't know the context of this he may have just

53:19.040 --> 53:24.000
suggested it one time passing or it may have been a more coercive problem but he's been given a

53:24.000 --> 53:29.280
chance to address himself in this situation and i am pleased with that he has the chance to improve

53:29.280 --> 53:34.880
himself and work on his image i do not believe he's a bad person though that's just my opinion

53:34.880 --> 53:39.840
and i may have been duped the slazo may not be the change man that i view him as now and i'll

53:39.840 --> 53:45.600
have to hold my hands up and that's okay because we get things wrong sometimes i've got things

53:45.600 --> 53:50.800
wrong i'm probably gonna get things wrong again we can't expect to get everything completely right

53:50.800 --> 53:56.080
but if we end up in a situation that is so much bigger than us where a person's career might rely

53:56.080 --> 54:01.120
on our own conduct then we need to hold our hands up and if there's more to come then just let

54:01.120 --> 54:05.680
people know if you think that holding off information and surprise releasing it in bits

54:05.680 --> 54:11.760
is gonna own your critics you are really wrong allegations are not film sequels although i have

54:11.760 --> 54:16.000
spoken about my involvement in this it would be unfair to not note the work of the many people

54:16.000 --> 54:20.560
who did provide slazo with the support when certain creators continued to turn on him in

54:20.560 --> 54:25.680
spite of his rather conclusive response with what we know i do believe they did the right thing and

54:25.680 --> 54:30.240
provided substantial criticism to names who would have otherwise gone unchecked and i must give them

54:30.240 --> 54:35.920
their due credit to finish i definitely urge people to take a bit more of a careful response

54:35.920 --> 54:39.840
to allegations in the future there's nothing wrong with throwing your weight behind and taking a

54:39.840 --> 54:44.240
stand and making creators address these things at the end of the day i do believe it's their

54:44.240 --> 54:48.960
responsibility but definitely don't go on a clowning stampede the main goal should be to

54:48.960 --> 54:53.840
have people address it and if they can't they've messed up then we can enact what we view as a

54:53.840 --> 55:00.000
proportional response justice is a responsibility incumbent on the community creators and audiences

55:00.640 --> 55:05.600
it's a shame that it was misused in this instance but hopefully it's at a close now and we can all

55:05.600 --> 55:16.880
move forward so yes that's the video i hope you enjoyed it was definitely a difficult one to

55:16.880 --> 55:20.640
write but we got there in the end i really want to give a big shout out to the editors who once
