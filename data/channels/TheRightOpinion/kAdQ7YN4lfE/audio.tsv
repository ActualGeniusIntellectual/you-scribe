0	18640	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
18640	22320	too much free time, and although I don't really take requests, I still measure the
22320	27080	amount that I receive, and do put it into account when deciding which topic to cover.
27080	31640	After all, what is interesting to me needs to be interesting to you as well, and today
31640	35960	we have a topic that I received a disproportionately high amount of requests to cover while it
35960	41100	was all transpiring, but little to these people's knowledge, I was already following the situation
41100	46840	quite closely. Detective Tro is always one step ahead, anticipating each and every move
46840	51640	like a bloodhound, though let me clarify I'm not a furry, I promise guys. This is the sort
51640	56060	of drama that blows hot and cold very quickly, and I warn people who ask me to cover it that
56060	60580	this would be a while, but I still think in spite of the very momentary drama, there
60580	64680	were a lot of messages that can be taken away from it regardless of how trending it is.
64680	69100	So without further ado, I suggest I provide a quick rundown of the situation, as when
69100	73020	I posted about this in my community tab, many people were not aware.
73020	77800	This is Kurskazat, they are an educational YouTube channel ran by Philip Detmer. Educational
77800	82640	YouTube channels are pretty much as they sound, basically content that's used to educate
82640	87340	or inform the viewers. Kurskazat is definitely a significant player in this community with
87340	92260	over 8 million subscribers, they've been making videos since 2013, and their videos
92260	97340	typically present themselves to deliver information with a unique animation finesse. According
97340	103280	to them, they want to make science look beautiful, because it is. Very respectable intentions
103280	104280	indeed.
104280	108280	Arguably however, channels like his own have some of the greatest responsibility on the
108280	112420	platform to deliver accurate representation of the topics they cover, because they are
112420	118420	not merely opinionated, but they are supposedly factual. Many people who may be slightly uninformed
118420	123400	go into a video with the expectation that the information presented will be truthful
123400	129000	and honest. A high majority of people do not pause documentaries every 5 seconds to fact
129000	132320	check them, because a high majority of people are not me.
132320	136920	However, on the other side of the spectrum, you will face vehement inspection from ruthless
136920	141600	academics and upcoming YouTubers alike, and if you fail to deliver your content concisely
141600	146220	and honestly, you risk having your reputation completely decimated, and that's important
146220	150460	when you're a channel like Kurskazat, and that leads us to the crux of the discussion
150460	151460	today.
151460	156020	In October 2015, they released a video that was titled Everything We Think We Know About
156020	160920	Addiction Is Wrong, a pretty strong title, and one that they did change in the end to
160920	165040	addiction. In the video, they rebut the notion that chemicals are the main root cause of
165040	169340	an individual becoming addicted, and actually the circumstances that many of these individuals
169340	173740	find themselves in are much more influential, and we should begin to ask questions about
173740	178500	society. This was conducted in collaboration with the works of a psychologist known as
178500	183820	Johann Hari. This video grew to be one of their most successful, accumulating over 15
183820	188460	million views, pretty incredible. However, it has also been heavily criticised as being
188460	194460	overly one-sided in the favour of the circumstantial narrative, and arguing about it from an excessively
194460	198960	objective point of view, when there is a significant amount of dissenting evidence
198960	200320	that challenges this.
200320	204420	This is where we introduce another player into this tale, a YouTuber by the name of
204420	209300	Coffee Break, or Steven. He's a video essayist who makes content covering various topics
209300	213340	related to media. He's been going for a little over two years, and has racked up some
213340	218420	pretty impressive video performances in that time, on fairly unique, interesting topics,
218420	223100	nothing to be discredited whatsoever. However, he was one of the people who wasn't entirely
223100	227780	happy with Kurzgesagt's video covering addiction, so he planned to make a video in which part
227780	231920	of it incorporated his problems with that video, and the further questions around the
231920	236840	credibility and responsibility of those channels. While doing this, he reached out to Philip
236840	242180	Detmer and Johann Hari in around February of this year, to try and ascertain their opinions
242180	247100	from the glorious position of hindsight. After an exchange with Detmer, Steven noticed
247100	251500	that Kurzgesagt had dropped a video which directly responded to some of the criticisms
251500	257000	that he raised in his initial emails. This video was titled Can You Trust Kurzgesagt,
257000	261620	in which they admit their shortcomings of their videos on refugees and of course addiction,
261620	265940	before stating that they would be removing these videos from their catalogue. So in response
265940	271200	to this, Coffee Break uploaded a video alleging that Detmer basically hoodwinked him, taking
271200	275700	the criticisms that Steven had presented, and making a video to get ahead of him, while
275700	280540	keeping him from this knowledge, thus stalling his video. I'll be breaking down the details
280580	285900	of all that in a bit. This video very quickly caught fire on Reddit, and led to a huge influx
285900	291340	of views, and subsequently rather passionate users sharply criticising Detmer for his conduct.
291340	296300	Kurzgesagt then decided to take on criticism by responding directly, by hosting their own
296300	300660	Reddit Q&A in the moment to try and quell the outrage that was growing against them.
300660	305040	This led to them consenting the release of the initial emails, which Coffee Break subsequently
305040	309460	did. However, what these revealed was that Steven's presentation in his initial video
309460	314220	wasn't completely accurate, and left out context that could alter the interpretation
314220	319220	of the exchange. This then led Steven to receiving a heavy amount of criticism, alongside the
319220	323260	counter-arguments that it would've been very difficult for Kurzgesagt to produce a
323260	328140	whole video in the space of a month, just to deflect some criticism from an incoming
328140	332900	video. Philip DeFranco then uploaded a video where he spent the first 10 minutes dedicated
332900	337180	to this one story, predominantly responding to Coffee Break's video, and claiming that
337180	342260	it was a bitter hit piece which misrepresented the email exchange as well as Kurzgesagt's
342260	346000	response video. In addition to this, Steven posted a thread on his Twitter page in which
346000	350220	he placed out all his arguments and the criticisms, and then declared that he would be taking
350220	355300	a break, a Coffee Break, from social media, likely due to the spiralling situation, but
355300	358140	maybe also to focus on his upcoming video.
358140	361800	That's just a summary of the situation, and looking at it I can understand why people
361800	365840	have asked me to cover it, because there are a lot of details and nuances. However, it's
365840	369320	important to load this analysis with the fact that Coffee Break has since released
369320	373580	a video apologising, and it seems like a genuine video. I'd definitely recommend checking
373580	377360	it out, because a lot of people haven't seen it since the controversy. I'd also
377360	381860	take this knowledge into the forthcoming video. I'm still doing this because I think there
381860	385720	are some good messages to take away, and I started working on it over a month ago and
385720	389120	didn't have the knowledge at the time he was going to apologise, and some of the lads
389120	393360	put a lot of work into it, but then unfortunately one of my editors got his stuff confiscated
393360	397900	for spending 100 quid of his parents' money on wine, which is so ridiculous that it has
397900	401760	to be true, but we're here now. With that all in mind, this will be one of the more
401760	406400	inconsequential videos I make, but I still hope we can have a good old discussion over it.
414080	417880	When I first decided that I was going to cover this video, my immediate decision was to actually
417880	422240	watch Kurzgesagt's original video, and although it might not seem like the most relevant thing
422240	425880	to do, I think it's important to see if Detmer or Coffee Break's perspective seemed
425880	430620	more rational or justifiable, because Detmer was at least under the perception at some
430620	435640	point that this content was justified in its educational tone, Steven clearly felt differently.
435640	439360	I went into this video with the expectation that this video was going to say something
439360	444620	like chemical elements don't play a part, and in fact it's all completely circumstantial.
444620	448880	That was the impression I not just received from Coffee Break's video, but from Kurzgesagt's
448880	458560	own video, but when I watched the video I did not receive that impression at all, don't
458560	462480	get me wrong, I understand why people may have interpreted it that way, and maybe it's
462480	467940	just my mental process that takes all information in moderation, but I just felt that the greater
467940	473120	message was that actually we tend to pin addiction too much to the chemical causes, and not enough
473120	477880	to the actual circumstances, understanding that there are many other environmental factors
477880	480640	that increase people's susceptibility to drug addiction.
480640	482840	I mean there's the intro.
482840	485600	What causes, say, heroin addiction?
485600	488040	This is a really stupid question, right?
488040	490200	It's obvious, we all know it.
490200	494000	Heroin causes heroin addiction, here's how it works.
494000	499040	If you use heroin for 20 days, by day 21, your body would physically crave the drug
499040	502640	ferociously because there are chemical hooks in the drug.
502640	507000	That's what addiction means, but there's a catch.
507000	510120	Just everything we think we know about addiction is wrong.
510120	515160	But that's as close as it gets to actual denial of causation, and even then it sounds
515160	519440	like they're challenging the assumption that a person is not susceptible to addiction
519440	521120	until they try the drug.
521120	522440	Is it a biased piece?
522440	523440	For sure.
523440	524880	Could they have included more caveats?
524880	528880	Yes, without a doubt, but when I heard the discussion surrounding it, I was expecting
528880	533520	something much more one-sided, when all I received was an opinion backed up with evidence.
533520	538120	When we are happy and healthy, we will bond with the people around us, but when we can't,
538120	542360	because we're traumatized, isolated, or beaten down by life, we will bond with something
542360	544960	that gives us some sense of relief.
544960	548160	Maybe that's what makes the video so harmful in its narratives.
548160	551840	I'm not particularly well-versed in the science of addiction, and the fact is that although
551840	557060	the video does present its information in a fairly systematic, objective way, it is
557060	563040	also claimed to omit many criticisms and counter-narratives against not just the content, but the studies,
563040	567100	and thus push an unchallenged point of view when actually the truth isn't as clear, which
567100	569100	I can understand would be a problem.
569100	572700	Maybe the video has just done a good job at deceiving me, and I'm sure that if you were
572700	576480	to challenge the research in Johan Hari's book, you'd probably find the issues that
576480	580480	Stephen appears to find as well, and that I can understand could cause problems.
580480	584640	I also think very few people are going to challenge the idea that societal conditions
584640	589200	don't play a role in someone's increase in vulnerability to addiction, and I can understand
589200	593600	how a video like this may help people, and therefore, it does make sense that Detmer
593600	598460	may be protective of it, in spite of the possible flaws that Coffee Break was investigating.
598460	603420	As a perspective, it is certainly contributory, just not as universal as it implies.
603420	607780	So I guess with that in mind, we can move on to the email exchange, and ask, with context,
607780	610040	how fair were the questions that Stephen put forward.
610040	615000	This is important to understand, because the opening two emails dictate a very clear tone
615000	619620	that might imply who's being unreasonable, which can then justify later statements.
619620	624160	We can't prove any intentions, but we can definitely assemble some sort of case.
624160	628720	So here we have Coffee Break's first email, which is in my opinion fairly reasonable,
628720	630960	and straightforward in the case that it is making.
630960	634400	It outlines many of the arguments that have been made against Hari's book, which does
634400	639120	throw the original video into a contentious light, especially given its framing, and given
639120	643800	the fact that you may have misrepresented content to approximately 18 million people,
643800	645520	I mean, that's a pretty big deal.
645520	648520	So at this point, I don't believe there's any malicious intent.
648520	653360	At the end of the email, he emphasises that he doesn't want to make a gotcha piece,
653360	658080	given the influence of the video, I doubt many people would say it shouldn't be challenged,
658080	661760	whether they've moved on from that stage or not, and although these happenings shouldn't
661760	666160	be mirrored on the character of a person years later, their narrative should be reflected
666160	670120	on to make sure that other channels don't make the same mistake.
670120	674320	However, Philip wasn't really buying it, and stated the light that I saw when I watched
674320	680200	the video, that as a quote take, it can stay to exist as a helpful one, and yes, as a take
680200	684920	it works, as a philosophical point of view, a high majority of the video definitely works
684920	689120	as that, however, if the actual research that the conclusions were based on was inherently
689120	692000	faulty, then that is a problem, and it should be discussed.
692000	696400	At the end of the day, Philip does come across as someone in a bit of denial, particularly
696400	700680	when he responds and alleges that it does seem like a gotcha piece, therefore, I can
700680	705400	understand why Steven responds fairly in depth to explaining his intentions and the evidence,
705400	709840	it does seem like a pretty honest email, and goes into persuasive depth explaining that
709840	711200	he does not have malice.
711200	714560	Now, it's possible that Detmer didn't look at his channel and assume that he could have
714560	718840	been a journalist looking for a spicy headline, I mean, he does use the word journalist, or
718840	723460	he could have been well aware of Coffee Break's videos, and had a negative perception of them,
723460	728160	maybe he knows a school of life, and he saw his video where Coffee Break criticises them
728160	729760	pretty harshly.
729760	733700	Educational channels may already have a negative perception of Steven's work, so I think
733700	737740	at this point you have a bit of a stalemate, maybe Detmer's being a bit harsh given the
737740	741700	very plausible criticisms of his content, but on the other hand, when you've made
741700	746020	a mistake, you don't want it being exploited to have conclusions drawn about your character
746020	747900	that aren't necessarily true to this day.
747900	752780	There has been a lot of conversation about intentions, both sides have alleged that they
752780	757460	were acting in ill intent at some point, and I don't get the impression that either
757460	761760	of them are displaying any sort of malice, Steven's going into great depth to explain
761760	766660	a heavily researched idea that clearly matters to him, and there's no necessity for malice
766660	771300	if Coffee Break obtains what he envisions, Detmer probably suggests an interview because
771300	776340	it will offer him the most unfiltered way to convey his present sentiments to ironically
776340	778420	avoid journalistic paraphrasing.
778420	782860	It seems at this point that with the subsequent emails, an interview is on the cards.
782860	784860	So what went wrong?
784860	785860	Well.
796140	800820	When you interact with someone new, you're typically dealing with a very fragile formation
800820	801820	of trust.
801820	806100	You're sharing information with a stranger which makes you vulnerable to exploitation,
806100	807680	and no one really wants that.
807680	811760	Although I believe the conversation has been conducted fairly reasonably at this point
811760	816200	with justified views on each side, it's also quite easy to note that the exchange
816200	817880	is still rather tense.
817880	822480	These guys are both very sceptical, as a smaller YouTuber you're always concerned that you
822480	827160	could be taken advantage of with a lesser platform to retaliate, and you probably have
827160	831400	the perception that many large creators are just corporate machines who solve their soul
831400	832400	to get there.
832400	836080	On the other hand, large creators are very aware of the scope on them, and a channel
836080	841560	like Kurzgesagt's reputation rests on viewer trust, so having their content discredited
841560	843160	is a real concern.
843160	847000	These people don't know each other, therefore you receive the impression that all it takes
847000	852040	is one failed communication to screw this all up, and in the end it happens.
852040	856120	Steven writes another rather in-depth email explaining his series and content, as well
856120	860760	as explaining his journey of research with Johan Hari, and provides the time frame of
860760	861760	the video plan.
861760	865600	Phillip then sends an email saying that the earliest they conduct the interview is the
865640	869600	end of next week, and that he'll need the questions in advance.
869600	874480	This was the last email before Kurzgesagt released his video, and Kurzgesagt's video
874480	879040	addressed a few of the narratives that Steven wrote in his initial video, as documented
879040	880680	in the Coffee Break upload.
880680	881680	Steven wrote,
881680	885720	Unfortunately, we did not reach out to scientists or do extra research on the papers that were
885720	888320	the basis for the video's thesis.
888320	893360	We simplified an idea so much that it made a great story, but became distorting.
893360	897080	We often look at creators on the internet for reliable information.
897080	899920	We rely on the fact that they're careful and rigorous.
899920	904680	The world is too complex for simple answers, and we don't want to be the ones giving them.
904680	909240	This led to an implied narrative that Kurzgesagt had basically used the criticisms that Coffee
909240	914080	Break had brought up and made a response to them, while also removing the video in question,
914080	916840	a surprising backpedal from his earlier email.
916840	922520	Out of our work, and these two videos don't make us proud, so today we deleted them.
922520	926520	In his emails with me, he seemed happy with the addiction video and didn't want to take
926520	927520	it down.
927520	932360	However, with that said, looking at the emails, it's not as cut and dry as it first appears.
932360	936120	I think it's important to get the first detail out of the way, that Coffee Break never
936120	938080	sent Detmer any questions.
938080	941120	Does that mean that Coffee Break wasn't actually interested in the interview?
941120	942120	No, not at all.
942120	946480	In fact, I can understand that given Detmer's rather slow responses, he was under the impression
946480	950920	that he didn't have to rush sending out the questions, but equally it did affect Coffee
950920	956320	Break's video, because in his clips, Stephen presented it as if the conversation had closed
956320	960760	on this agreement, and a commitment that one side had not honoured.
960760	965160	I share with him my idea, and some of the questions and criticisms I had, and he replied
965160	968960	to me that he would be interested in doing an interview, provided I wait.
968960	973960	He was busy travelling, and told me to wait till early March before we could do the interview.
973960	978760	And March 3rd was the day I found out what Philip had been really busy doing, too busy
978760	980440	to answer my questions.
980480	986680	But in reality, Stephen had left it very open ended, and by not providing further correspondence,
986680	989880	he did not give Detmer an impetus to respond further.
989880	995480	Now, does that mean on principle that he can't be angry of the video if his instinct was correct?
995480	1000400	No, but what would have been more advisable is an email to perhaps confront Detmer on
1000400	1004760	the release of this video, I assume they both still had contact, and then at least he would
1004760	1009000	have had the chance to explain himself, he would have been able to ascertain Detmer's
1009000	1013160	position on the interview, as Detmer claimed in a statement to DeFranco that he still would
1013160	1014160	have done it.
1014160	1015160	We are.
1015160	1016920	Naturally of note here, Philip sent me a statement saying,
1016920	1020880	I didn't stall him with malice in mind, but I also didn't motivate him to work faster.
1020880	1023120	Of course I wanted to have the first word on my own failings.
1023120	1027280	I have been working on and off on the video since early 2017, which made it extra frustrating.
1027280	1030200	So I decided to finish the video and release, it felt like the right thing to do.
1030200	1033640	I never would have thought that he'd go this far and purposefully misrepresented our email
1033640	1034640	conversation.
1034640	1037440	It is sad this whole thing happened, I really would have done the interview with him.
1037880	1045400	This was a mighty L for Steven, as now Detmer has the reasonable high ground of saying that
1045400	1049080	he would have done the interview, but he won't, because of this conflict.
1049080	1054120	The problem is, in this instance, what Steven did changes the perception, it makes it look
1054120	1059000	like Steven did not seek resolution, more so instigation, and we don't tend to side
1059000	1060000	with the instigator.
1060000	1063240	Do I believe he just wanted a spicy hit piece?
1063240	1068040	No, in fact, in my opinion, he probably felt like he spent so much time sharing copious
1068040	1073320	amounts of information with this person about what he was investigating, divulged so much
1073320	1077520	of it to Phillip, and been so transparent, he likely then thought that Detmer's behaviour
1077520	1080560	was in bad faith when Kurzgesagt released that video.
1080560	1084400	But I still feel that even if you're doubtful about a person you're confronting, you should
1084400	1088800	confront them one more time, because the worst result of a confrontation is that they provide
1088800	1093600	alternative information that prevents you from making a video, and if you made a video,
1093600	1097960	they would have presented the information afterwards and made you look like an idiot.
1097960	1101840	Another huge problem people had with the Coffee Break video was the paraphrasing.
1101840	1106280	I've always found the concept of paraphrasing in these instances to be rather weird, if
1106280	1109880	you're explaining what someone was saying, wouldn't it just be easier to just show
1109880	1110880	what they're saying?
1110880	1116680	I mean, I digress, I get the respect for privacy, but I find it strangely pedantic and impractical,
1116680	1118240	relating to situations like this.
1118240	1124000	For me, confidentiality is something relating to specific topics, and if you can't explain
1124000	1128120	it without leaving out details, then it makes me question whether you should be explaining
1128120	1129120	it at all.
1129120	1133600	He basically says, hey, the addiction video wasn't perfect, but I feel it was good enough.
1133600	1137960	On one hand, I don't find this clip a huge deal, the wording would have worked if he'd
1137960	1142800	phrased it as Detmer saying it was good enough to remain up on YouTube, which he does actually
1142800	1145360	show at a later time on the video.
1145360	1149240	But also, saying something is good enough on the quality barometer, and good enough
1149240	1154460	to remain up on YouTube due to its positive cultural impact, are two very different perspectives,
1154460	1157600	it wouldn't have hurt Stephen to include those extra details.
1157600	1161600	On the other hand, I feel that although Coffee Break wasn't entitled to that knowledge,
1161600	1165000	Detmer definitely could have saved a lot of hassle by informing Stephen that he had a
1165000	1170120	video in the works that did respond to these questions, and Detmer did seem to imply that
1171120	1175880	It seems like a real issue of transparency, and neither party had the assumption of trust,
1175880	1181080	and when Stephen interpreted Detmer as breaking that trust, he took every single worst reservation
1181080	1184920	he had of the sort of channels like Curse Gazettes and projected it.
1184920	1188360	It's clear in the emails, he had done a lot of research, and I can understand why
1188360	1192920	that would have annoyed him, it does derail the basis for an interview, and if Detmer
1192920	1197320	stalked him and didn't disclose the information he was pushing a video through, I can understand
1197320	1199600	why he'd feel a bit pissed off.
1199600	1203800	And Stephen's not innocent here either, and he could have at least sought more understanding
1203800	1208480	before releasing this video, but what can be understood, well, let's talk about practical
1208480	1211640	details.
1211640	1216740	So this all blew up on Reddit in the true fashion, with a rallying battle cry of attention
1216740	1221560	brought to it, and in the classic David vs Goliath scenario, people went at Curse for
1221560	1224100	what they had been presented by one side.
1224100	1228840	But in this scenario, Curse Gazette was actually there to host their own Q&A, and this changed
1228840	1231960	the tide rather quickly, and brought up some legitimate points.
1231960	1235920	For one, unless he reused assets for which there was no real evidence of, it would have
1235920	1240080	been very difficult to create a video in the space of a month, and it must have been the
1240080	1244560	work for some length of time, some say it was almost two years, therefore making the
1244560	1249360	whole idea that he'd just hijacked the narrative kind of unlikely, but okay, it was still kind
1249360	1253980	of ambiguous at the time, because Kofi Break's points relating to the video didn't necessarily
1253980	1258680	cover the entirety of Curse Gazette's video length, and at this point, both sides kind
1258680	1260940	of thought it played into their hands.
1260940	1265080	What we know is that from the Reddit follow-up Q&A, that Kofi Break at least provided some
1265080	1270060	push for the video to come out, and the demo would have to have altered some content.
1270060	1274040	Then there was this discussion about the second video included in the video as proof that
1274040	1276720	Kofi Break's research couldn't have influenced it.
1276720	1281020	"...dressed two of his bad videos instead of just the one, but this would make sense
1281020	1284360	whether he stole my video idea or already had a video in the works.
1284360	1288100	If you know two past videos are wrong, and you decide that based on someone asking too
1288100	1291660	many questions, you're going to delete one of them and spin the story, it only makes
1291660	1293420	sense to delete the other.
1293420	1296060	So this is just evidence that Curse Gazette is smart."
1296060	1300900	And honestly, here is where we see a problem forming with a lot of Stephen's arguments,
1300900	1303860	is that they don't prove anything beyond reasonable doubts.
1303860	1307740	I interpret this argument as implying that Detmer was smart enough to avoid the argument
1307740	1312800	that he plagiarised a single video by including this extra video in his self-analysis, and
1312800	1314740	no doubt Detmer's a smart man.
1314740	1319260	I mean, you have to be to an extent with his work, but the problem is that it's equally
1319260	1324060	explainable from a perspective that this was part of a greater video, that he had been
1324060	1325220	working on before.
1325220	1329820	We know that Kofi Break's criticism isn't that unique, and although Detmer may be clever,
1329820	1334540	may be very clever, you don't have the evidence to prove that this was his train of thought,
1334540	1339620	and that's important when you make a dark video with overdramatic music preaching about
1339620	1340620	transparency.
1340620	1346340	This video wasn't inspired by self-reflection on responsible research, it was inspired to
1346340	1348100	cover their ass.
1348100	1351260	And what's disgusting is how well this has worked out for them.
1351260	1358040	Look at how celebrated they are for coming out so transparently.
1358040	1362940	And I think what I find the most distasteful is not them trying to get ahead of a story,
1362940	1367660	but the way they act so self-righteous and like they're such good ethical researchers.
1367660	1372100	You need to have a tone that justifies the information and the level of conviction you
1372100	1376440	have, and one of the biggest problems with the Kofi Break video is that it oversteps
1376440	1379780	in its tone without having the conviction in its knowledge.
1379780	1383580	Detmer can be criticised for sure, I don't like the fact that he stools Stephen and didn't
1383580	1387640	inform him about the video, but the criticism that Kofi Break raised wasn't the first
1387640	1392100	time that someone had brought it up, and therefore the claim of actually plagiarising the supposed
1392100	1395020	interview seems a bit far-fetched.
1395020	1396520	Criticisms aren't exclusive.
1396520	1399940	When the dark tone was revealed not to be fully justified, and with the information
1399940	1403960	that was omitted shown in the publication of the emails, people felt deceived, and many
1403960	1408260	of these people were people who participated in a rather harsh mobbing of cursed gazettes
1408260	1412680	on Reddit when the initial situation transpired, so they were embarrassed too, and a lot of
1412680	1414920	people turned this back onto Kofi Break.
1414920	1419200	In his tweets, Stephen sums up the main points of criticism against him, but that's the
1419200	1423100	problem, although these are the roots of the misinformation, what they lead to is much
1423100	1426100	more harmful when you combine it with the rhetoric in the video.
1426100	1429900	If I gave some wrongful information about a group of people, and then went on a five
1429900	1434160	minute rant about how this implies that the group of people are just terrible and cannot
1434160	1438740	be trusted ever again, it would be much worse than if I just gave the misinformation, because
1438740	1444380	the former situation requires a level of confidence that in this situation has not been well founded.
1444380	1448980	This led to a lot of people implying that Kofi Break's video was created opportunistically,
1448980	1452260	out of this spite that he just wanted to catch debt morale to expose him.
1452300	1456180	I don't know if it's that. As said, he wore his heart on his sleeve in a lot of the
1456180	1461000	emails, and I think given his other content, he didn't really have too much of a motivation
1461000	1466260	to snap like that and cash in on an easy expose. He's relatively successful for his size,
1466260	1470860	and his videos all typically outperform his subscriber count. His circumstances didn't
1470860	1475620	really precede such an action being driven out of the motivation for clout.
1475620	1480100	As Detmer said himself, it doesn't seem like malice, more just a moment of someone
1480100	1484100	who's lost their temper with someone they feel has screwed them over. But what were
1484100	1490820	the motivations, and what conclusions can really be drawn from this very weird and wild situation?
1490820	1511420	I think as a smaller YouTuber, you tend to be cynical towards the large groups of craters,
1511420	1515820	and that can be seen in Kofi Break's later tweets about that theory. Is it possible they
1515820	1520500	have a little gang going on? Sure, I have my group chats in which I share intel and
1520500	1524740	opinions with people, and discuss the content we're making, and the people who've made
1524740	1530520	content about us. These guys do tend to engage in some agreement, but at the end of it all,
1530520	1535220	if you have enough solid evidence, then you will be able to topple these people, and Steven
1535220	1539860	just didn't. If there's reasonable doubt, these guys are gonna stick up for each other
1539860	1544860	because they think they know that person's character better than you, and they want to
1544860	1550140	support their friends. Kofi Break had the chance to gain some more elaborative information
1550140	1555100	and didn't, in my opinion because he didn't trust Detmer's words, because he felt he'd
1555100	1559260	been screwed over. Detmer, on the other hand, wasn't perfect in his conduct either, and
1559260	1563220	I think he kind of acknowledges that. The problem was that he was clearly worried about
1563220	1568540	being cancelled if his videos were shown to be poorly researched, he feels his 2015 videos
1568540	1572660	don't represent him now, and they probably don't. I watched some of his more recent
1572660	1576740	content, and it's well written and well referenced, but at the same time, just because
1576740	1580200	we shouldn't cancel someone doesn't mean we shouldn't have a discussion about the
1580200	1584780	influence they had at the time. Those videos still received millions of views, and they
1584780	1590220	may not have considered the consequences at the time, but they did have consequences nonetheless.
1590220	1594380	You may be able to counter criticism of your current mentality, but you can't escape
1594380	1599620	what was conducted. But with that in mind, with the fact that the discussion should be
1599620	1604980	about the consequences of the video, I want to ask you people one final question, does
1604980	1611340	Kurzgesagt's video reflecting on his mistakes change much of Coffee Break's video? I mean,
1611340	1615980	it screws up the interview, which I can understand may annoy Stephen a little, but at the end
1615980	1621900	of the day, Stephen wanted to know the information from Kurzgesagt, and now he has it. If you're
1621900	1625580	making a video on the actual implications of misinformation on the internet, then this
1625580	1629660	doesn't affect the narrative. They still made the video, it still had major consequences,
1629660	1633980	and I can't read the mind of Stephen, but I assume that's what he was making the video
1633980	1637940	on. And I watched Coffee Break's uploaded video about it called Pop Science, and it
1637940	1642380	covers these ideas in a lot more depth. It's a great video, he doesn't actually reference
1642380	1646360	Kurzgesagt's video for obvious reasons, but it was still a really compelling video
1646360	1650700	that covers the topic of simplification in Pop Science well. I mean, Kurzgesagt's video
1650700	1679300	covered the criticism surface level at best. Compare these two clips.
1679300	1684180	It sounds like Coffee Break's video has a lot more to reveal, and a lot more to discuss.
1684180	1688660	The main point of Kurzgesagt's video is relating to how they feel about the video
1688660	1693260	in hindsight, and although they reflect on some of Stephen's criticisms, they don't
1693260	1697660	really nullify them, nor would I say they have stolen them from the specific context
1697660	1701620	that they were going to be used from in the upcoming Coffee Break video. If everything
1701620	1704940	Coffee Break had said in his initial email is true, then he shouldn't have worried
1704940	1709980	about his research being undone. I get that he feels a bit monked off, but if his intention
1709980	1714060	was to question the influence of creators and consequences to that effect, then he should
1714060	1717980	have been fine, and he was fine. It looks like Kurzgesagt has moved on from his old
1717980	1721860	mistakes and although we should always question these things as standards for all channels,
1721860	1726940	I wouldn't hold it against him, and that kinda leads me back to where I started. This
1726940	1731420	is not a big deal, could Phillip have been more honest? Sure, but we don't know the
1731420	1736300	extent to this, and we certainly can't draw any clear conclusions on his character, and
1736300	1740860	although I don't think Coffee Break made the video for Clout, it did seem rather personal
1740860	1745340	on the basis that he felt like he'd been misled, and although I can empathise with
1745340	1749580	the annoyance after he was so open and in depth, I think it's moments like that that
1749580	1753860	if you don't care, you carry on, and just finish the video that you started on, and
1753860	1758220	if you do care, you confront them, and see what they have to say for themselves. It will
1758220	1763100	give you more of an outlook, and probably more to actually respond to, and now because
1763100	1768620	of that, Steven has taken a fat L, but in all fairness, he owned it, and he had the
1768620	1773420	humility to admit it. I'd also like to point out that this is the second incident that
1773420	1778340	has been blown up by Reddit on the passionate whim of individuals without further investigation,
1778340	1782260	obviously the previous one being the Matt Watson scenario, the difference being with
1782260	1786460	that one, that there was no person to really provide a counter narrative because YouTube
1786460	1791440	never tells us anything. This one we had Detmer responding, and changing the perspective
1791440	1797060	of a lot of people, he knows exactly how to respond to these sorts of comments, and knows
1797060	1802300	exactly how to blunt a lot of the criticism that was coming at him, he knows how to set
1802300	1807240	points against him, and then it will lead people to build off that and then turn that
1807240	1812500	onto Coffee Break. He was very very good in his Reddit Q&A, and if you want a lesson in
1812500	1817780	how to respond, I know I talk about bad responses a lot, but Curskazat's Reddit Q&A was a
1817780	1822660	masterstroke in how to respond. Let me make this clear, the Reddit Q&A didn't change
1822660	1827060	the validity of the arguments per se, but what you saw was a load of people mobbing
1827060	1832780	Curskazat without the full picture, when Curskazat was there to offer his perspective. At that
1832780	1838020	point, maybe it's time to take a moment of self reflection before jumping on something
1838020	1843260	we don't entirely understand, and because the whole situation was so polarised the pendulum
1843260	1848020	completely swung one way or the other, one point attacking this person, and then that
1848020	1852740	person, and maybe everyone was just a bit bored so they needed some drama to spice their
1852740	1857420	life up, but I'd really be careful with the power of the mob, it will backfire in
1857420	1863500	worse ways than this. Can we really trust Curskazat? I mean not entirely, but that's
1863500	1867220	the case for all these channels, I had a friend who helped me out with some of the research
1867220	1871420	for this video, who was an expert in biology, and they watched one of their videos relating
1871420	1875940	to the subject, and they took issue with some of the stuff that was said, I'll leave their
1875940	1881020	Twitter link in the pinned comment. However, I don't think this situation is wholly relevant
1881020	1885940	to that question, because this situation is much more related to a personal dispute that
1885940	1891300	was at most given the outlet in that extra Curskazat video, which will probably not be
1891300	1895400	repeated. If you feel that some content is inaccurate then you have every right to express
1895400	1899560	it and call them out for it, and question the influence of that content. The problem
1899560	1904500	is that both Phillip and Steven themselves as people, not as channels, clearly distrust
1904500	1908940	each other, and when that semblance of transparency wasn't displayed, one made the worst assumption
1908940	1914020	about the other, it went off the rails, and you've ended up with this very messy situation.
1914020	1918360	On the other hand, this is an easy lesson in exposed videos, if you're going to try
1918360	1922920	it and prove someone isn't trustworthy and put it over in a strong tone, then you better
1922920	1927120	nab the receipts baby, or you're gonna get charged, especially when the other party
1927120	1936960	is more than prepared to respond. But that's the tea, or the coffee in this instance.
1936960	1940800	I'd also like to add that this video is sponsored by ExpressVPN, given the recent
1940800	1945160	laws that might be restricting internet usage in the future, especially the glorious incoming
1945160	1950000	porn ban in the UK, such a progressive country, I thought I'd give them a complimentary
1950000	1953960	plug and say their service has been doing me really well, and if anyone's considering
1953960	1958960	it, you can get 3 months out of 12 months free, so basically 25% off by clicking the
1958960	1962860	link in the description below.
1962860	1968520	So yes, there is the video, I hope you guys enjoyed it, this one was a bit easier, a bit
1968520	1973600	more easy going, which was nice, wasn't as emotionally draining, but it was a bit more
1973600	1979580	contentious in many ways, because it's very easy to condemn someone who's already
1979580	1980580	hated.
1980580	1985760	I want to give a big shout out to my editors who have done a fantastic job, love you guys
1985760	1991680	very much, you are legends, please, I'm gonna leave their links in the pinned comment, go
1991680	1995360	check them out, go send them some love, appreciate them.
1995360	2000560	Also big shout out to my Patrons, list up on screen right now, and I have to give an
2000560	2010480	individual thanks to my $50 patreons, which are some hullabaloo, and $100 patreons, Evening
2010480	2018000	Steel and Brandon are quite sensational gents, I'm very very impressed, very impressed
