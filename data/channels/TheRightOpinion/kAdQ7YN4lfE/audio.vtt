Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:18.640 --> 00:22.320
too much free time, and although I don't really take requests, I still measure the

00:22.320 --> 00:27.080
amount that I receive, and do put it into account when deciding which topic to cover.

00:27.080 --> 00:31.640
After all, what is interesting to me needs to be interesting to you as well, and today

00:31.640 --> 00:35.960
we have a topic that I received a disproportionately high amount of requests to cover while it

00:35.960 --> 00:41.100
was all transpiring, but little to these people's knowledge, I was already following the situation

00:41.100 --> 00:46.840
quite closely. Detective Tro is always one step ahead, anticipating each and every move

00:46.840 --> 00:51.640
like a bloodhound, though let me clarify I'm not a furry, I promise guys. This is the sort

00:51.640 --> 00:56.060
of drama that blows hot and cold very quickly, and I warn people who ask me to cover it that

00:56.060 --> 01:00.580
this would be a while, but I still think in spite of the very momentary drama, there

01:00.580 --> 01:04.680
were a lot of messages that can be taken away from it regardless of how trending it is.

01:04.680 --> 01:09.100
So without further ado, I suggest I provide a quick rundown of the situation, as when

01:09.100 --> 01:13.020
I posted about this in my community tab, many people were not aware.

01:13.020 --> 01:17.800
This is Kurskazat, they are an educational YouTube channel ran by Philip Detmer. Educational

01:17.800 --> 01:22.640
YouTube channels are pretty much as they sound, basically content that's used to educate

01:22.640 --> 01:27.340
or inform the viewers. Kurskazat is definitely a significant player in this community with

01:27.340 --> 01:32.260
over 8 million subscribers, they've been making videos since 2013, and their videos

01:32.260 --> 01:37.340
typically present themselves to deliver information with a unique animation finesse. According

01:37.340 --> 01:43.280
to them, they want to make science look beautiful, because it is. Very respectable intentions

01:43.280 --> 01:44.280
indeed.

01:44.280 --> 01:48.280
Arguably however, channels like his own have some of the greatest responsibility on the

01:48.280 --> 01:52.420
platform to deliver accurate representation of the topics they cover, because they are

01:52.420 --> 01:58.420
not merely opinionated, but they are supposedly factual. Many people who may be slightly uninformed

01:58.420 --> 02:03.400
go into a video with the expectation that the information presented will be truthful

02:03.400 --> 02:09.000
and honest. A high majority of people do not pause documentaries every 5 seconds to fact

02:09.000 --> 02:12.320
check them, because a high majority of people are not me.

02:12.320 --> 02:16.920
However, on the other side of the spectrum, you will face vehement inspection from ruthless

02:16.920 --> 02:21.600
academics and upcoming YouTubers alike, and if you fail to deliver your content concisely

02:21.600 --> 02:26.220
and honestly, you risk having your reputation completely decimated, and that's important

02:26.220 --> 02:30.460
when you're a channel like Kurskazat, and that leads us to the crux of the discussion

02:30.460 --> 02:31.460
today.

02:31.460 --> 02:36.020
In October 2015, they released a video that was titled Everything We Think We Know About

02:36.020 --> 02:40.920
Addiction Is Wrong, a pretty strong title, and one that they did change in the end to

02:40.920 --> 02:45.040
addiction. In the video, they rebut the notion that chemicals are the main root cause of

02:45.040 --> 02:49.340
an individual becoming addicted, and actually the circumstances that many of these individuals

02:49.340 --> 02:53.740
find themselves in are much more influential, and we should begin to ask questions about

02:53.740 --> 02:58.500
society. This was conducted in collaboration with the works of a psychologist known as

02:58.500 --> 03:03.820
Johann Hari. This video grew to be one of their most successful, accumulating over 15

03:03.820 --> 03:08.460
million views, pretty incredible. However, it has also been heavily criticised as being

03:08.460 --> 03:14.460
overly one-sided in the favour of the circumstantial narrative, and arguing about it from an excessively

03:14.460 --> 03:18.960
objective point of view, when there is a significant amount of dissenting evidence

03:18.960 --> 03:20.320
that challenges this.

03:20.320 --> 03:24.420
This is where we introduce another player into this tale, a YouTuber by the name of

03:24.420 --> 03:29.300
Coffee Break, or Steven. He's a video essayist who makes content covering various topics

03:29.300 --> 03:33.340
related to media. He's been going for a little over two years, and has racked up some

03:33.340 --> 03:38.420
pretty impressive video performances in that time, on fairly unique, interesting topics,

03:38.420 --> 03:43.100
nothing to be discredited whatsoever. However, he was one of the people who wasn't entirely

03:43.100 --> 03:47.780
happy with Kurzgesagt's video covering addiction, so he planned to make a video in which part

03:47.780 --> 03:51.920
of it incorporated his problems with that video, and the further questions around the

03:51.920 --> 03:56.840
credibility and responsibility of those channels. While doing this, he reached out to Philip

03:56.840 --> 04:02.180
Detmer and Johann Hari in around February of this year, to try and ascertain their opinions

04:02.180 --> 04:07.100
from the glorious position of hindsight. After an exchange with Detmer, Steven noticed

04:07.100 --> 04:11.500
that Kurzgesagt had dropped a video which directly responded to some of the criticisms

04:11.500 --> 04:17.000
that he raised in his initial emails. This video was titled Can You Trust Kurzgesagt,

04:17.000 --> 04:21.620
in which they admit their shortcomings of their videos on refugees and of course addiction,

04:21.620 --> 04:25.940
before stating that they would be removing these videos from their catalogue. So in response

04:25.940 --> 04:31.200
to this, Coffee Break uploaded a video alleging that Detmer basically hoodwinked him, taking

04:31.200 --> 04:35.700
the criticisms that Steven had presented, and making a video to get ahead of him, while

04:35.700 --> 04:40.540
keeping him from this knowledge, thus stalling his video. I'll be breaking down the details

04:40.580 --> 04:45.900
of all that in a bit. This video very quickly caught fire on Reddit, and led to a huge influx

04:45.900 --> 04:51.340
of views, and subsequently rather passionate users sharply criticising Detmer for his conduct.

04:51.340 --> 04:56.300
Kurzgesagt then decided to take on criticism by responding directly, by hosting their own

04:56.300 --> 05:00.660
Reddit Q&A in the moment to try and quell the outrage that was growing against them.

05:00.660 --> 05:05.040
This led to them consenting the release of the initial emails, which Coffee Break subsequently

05:05.040 --> 05:09.460
did. However, what these revealed was that Steven's presentation in his initial video

05:09.460 --> 05:14.220
wasn't completely accurate, and left out context that could alter the interpretation

05:14.220 --> 05:19.220
of the exchange. This then led Steven to receiving a heavy amount of criticism, alongside the

05:19.220 --> 05:23.260
counter-arguments that it would've been very difficult for Kurzgesagt to produce a

05:23.260 --> 05:28.140
whole video in the space of a month, just to deflect some criticism from an incoming

05:28.140 --> 05:32.900
video. Philip DeFranco then uploaded a video where he spent the first 10 minutes dedicated

05:32.900 --> 05:37.180
to this one story, predominantly responding to Coffee Break's video, and claiming that

05:37.180 --> 05:42.260
it was a bitter hit piece which misrepresented the email exchange as well as Kurzgesagt's

05:42.260 --> 05:46.000
response video. In addition to this, Steven posted a thread on his Twitter page in which

05:46.000 --> 05:50.220
he placed out all his arguments and the criticisms, and then declared that he would be taking

05:50.220 --> 05:55.300
a break, a Coffee Break, from social media, likely due to the spiralling situation, but

05:55.300 --> 05:58.140
maybe also to focus on his upcoming video.

05:58.140 --> 06:01.800
That's just a summary of the situation, and looking at it I can understand why people

06:01.800 --> 06:05.840
have asked me to cover it, because there are a lot of details and nuances. However, it's

06:05.840 --> 06:09.320
important to load this analysis with the fact that Coffee Break has since released

06:09.320 --> 06:13.580
a video apologising, and it seems like a genuine video. I'd definitely recommend checking

06:13.580 --> 06:17.360
it out, because a lot of people haven't seen it since the controversy. I'd also

06:17.360 --> 06:21.860
take this knowledge into the forthcoming video. I'm still doing this because I think there

06:21.860 --> 06:25.720
are some good messages to take away, and I started working on it over a month ago and

06:25.720 --> 06:29.120
didn't have the knowledge at the time he was going to apologise, and some of the lads

06:29.120 --> 06:33.360
put a lot of work into it, but then unfortunately one of my editors got his stuff confiscated

06:33.360 --> 06:37.900
for spending 100 quid of his parents' money on wine, which is so ridiculous that it has

06:37.900 --> 06:41.760
to be true, but we're here now. With that all in mind, this will be one of the more

06:41.760 --> 06:46.400
inconsequential videos I make, but I still hope we can have a good old discussion over it.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.880
When I first decided that I was going to cover this video, my immediate decision was to actually

06:57.880 --> 07:02.240
watch Kurzgesagt's original video, and although it might not seem like the most relevant thing

07:02.240 --> 07:05.880
to do, I think it's important to see if Detmer or Coffee Break's perspective seemed

07:05.880 --> 07:10.620
more rational or justifiable, because Detmer was at least under the perception at some

07:10.620 --> 07:15.640
point that this content was justified in its educational tone, Steven clearly felt differently.

07:15.640 --> 07:19.360
I went into this video with the expectation that this video was going to say something

07:19.360 --> 07:24.620
like chemical elements don't play a part, and in fact it's all completely circumstantial.

07:24.620 --> 07:28.880
That was the impression I not just received from Coffee Break's video, but from Kurzgesagt's

07:28.880 --> 07:38.560
own video, but when I watched the video I did not receive that impression at all, don't

07:38.560 --> 07:42.480
get me wrong, I understand why people may have interpreted it that way, and maybe it's

07:42.480 --> 07:47.940
just my mental process that takes all information in moderation, but I just felt that the greater

07:47.940 --> 07:53.120
message was that actually we tend to pin addiction too much to the chemical causes, and not enough

07:53.120 --> 07:57.880
to the actual circumstances, understanding that there are many other environmental factors

07:57.880 --> 08:00.640
that increase people's susceptibility to drug addiction.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.840
I mean there's the intro.

08:02.840 --> 08:05.600
What causes, say, heroin addiction?

08:05.600 --> 08:08.040
This is a really stupid question, right?

08:08.040 --> 08:10.200
It's obvious, we all know it.

08:10.200 --> 08:14.000
Heroin causes heroin addiction, here's how it works.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.040
If you use heroin for 20 days, by day 21, your body would physically crave the drug

08:19.040 --> 08:22.640
ferociously because there are chemical hooks in the drug.

08:22.640 --> 08:27.000
That's what addiction means, but there's a catch.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.120
Just everything we think we know about addiction is wrong.

08:30.120 --> 08:35.160
But that's as close as it gets to actual denial of causation, and even then it sounds

08:35.160 --> 08:39.440
like they're challenging the assumption that a person is not susceptible to addiction

08:39.440 --> 08:41.120
until they try the drug.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.440
Is it a biased piece?

08:42.440 --> 08:43.440
For sure.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.880
Could they have included more caveats?

08:44.880 --> 08:48.880
Yes, without a doubt, but when I heard the discussion surrounding it, I was expecting

08:48.880 --> 08:53.520
something much more one-sided, when all I received was an opinion backed up with evidence.

08:53.520 --> 08:58.120
When we are happy and healthy, we will bond with the people around us, but when we can't,

08:58.120 --> 09:02.360
because we're traumatized, isolated, or beaten down by life, we will bond with something

09:02.360 --> 09:04.960
that gives us some sense of relief.

09:04.960 --> 09:08.160
Maybe that's what makes the video so harmful in its narratives.

09:08.160 --> 09:11.840
I'm not particularly well-versed in the science of addiction, and the fact is that although

09:11.840 --> 09:17.060
the video does present its information in a fairly systematic, objective way, it is

09:17.060 --> 09:23.040
also claimed to omit many criticisms and counter-narratives against not just the content, but the studies,

09:23.040 --> 09:27.100
and thus push an unchallenged point of view when actually the truth isn't as clear, which

09:27.100 --> 09:29.100
I can understand would be a problem.

09:29.100 --> 09:32.700
Maybe the video has just done a good job at deceiving me, and I'm sure that if you were

09:32.700 --> 09:36.480
to challenge the research in Johan Hari's book, you'd probably find the issues that

09:36.480 --> 09:40.480
Stephen appears to find as well, and that I can understand could cause problems.

09:40.480 --> 09:44.640
I also think very few people are going to challenge the idea that societal conditions

09:44.640 --> 09:49.200
don't play a role in someone's increase in vulnerability to addiction, and I can understand

09:49.200 --> 09:53.600
how a video like this may help people, and therefore, it does make sense that Detmer

09:53.600 --> 09:58.460
may be protective of it, in spite of the possible flaws that Coffee Break was investigating.

09:58.460 --> 10:03.420
As a perspective, it is certainly contributory, just not as universal as it implies.

10:03.420 --> 10:07.780
So I guess with that in mind, we can move on to the email exchange, and ask, with context,

10:07.780 --> 10:10.040
how fair were the questions that Stephen put forward.

10:10.040 --> 10:15.000
This is important to understand, because the opening two emails dictate a very clear tone

10:15.000 --> 10:19.620
that might imply who's being unreasonable, which can then justify later statements.

10:19.620 --> 10:24.160
We can't prove any intentions, but we can definitely assemble some sort of case.

10:24.160 --> 10:28.720
So here we have Coffee Break's first email, which is in my opinion fairly reasonable,

10:28.720 --> 10:30.960
and straightforward in the case that it is making.

10:30.960 --> 10:34.400
It outlines many of the arguments that have been made against Hari's book, which does

10:34.400 --> 10:39.120
throw the original video into a contentious light, especially given its framing, and given

10:39.120 --> 10:43.800
the fact that you may have misrepresented content to approximately 18 million people,

10:43.800 --> 10:45.520
I mean, that's a pretty big deal.

10:45.520 --> 10:48.520
So at this point, I don't believe there's any malicious intent.

10:48.520 --> 10:53.360
At the end of the email, he emphasises that he doesn't want to make a gotcha piece,

10:53.360 --> 10:58.080
given the influence of the video, I doubt many people would say it shouldn't be challenged,

10:58.080 --> 11:01.760
whether they've moved on from that stage or not, and although these happenings shouldn't

11:01.760 --> 11:06.160
be mirrored on the character of a person years later, their narrative should be reflected

11:06.160 --> 11:10.120
on to make sure that other channels don't make the same mistake.

11:10.120 --> 11:14.320
However, Philip wasn't really buying it, and stated the light that I saw when I watched

11:14.320 --> 11:20.200
the video, that as a quote take, it can stay to exist as a helpful one, and yes, as a take

11:20.200 --> 11:24.920
it works, as a philosophical point of view, a high majority of the video definitely works

11:24.920 --> 11:29.120
as that, however, if the actual research that the conclusions were based on was inherently

11:29.120 --> 11:32.000
faulty, then that is a problem, and it should be discussed.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.400
At the end of the day, Philip does come across as someone in a bit of denial, particularly

11:36.400 --> 11:40.680
when he responds and alleges that it does seem like a gotcha piece, therefore, I can

11:40.680 --> 11:45.400
understand why Steven responds fairly in depth to explaining his intentions and the evidence,

11:45.400 --> 11:49.840
it does seem like a pretty honest email, and goes into persuasive depth explaining that

11:49.840 --> 11:51.200
he does not have malice.

11:51.200 --> 11:54.560
Now, it's possible that Detmer didn't look at his channel and assume that he could have

11:54.560 --> 11:58.840
been a journalist looking for a spicy headline, I mean, he does use the word journalist, or

11:58.840 --> 12:03.460
he could have been well aware of Coffee Break's videos, and had a negative perception of them,

12:03.460 --> 12:08.160
maybe he knows a school of life, and he saw his video where Coffee Break criticises them

12:08.160 --> 12:09.760
pretty harshly.

12:09.760 --> 12:13.700
Educational channels may already have a negative perception of Steven's work, so I think

12:13.700 --> 12:17.740
at this point you have a bit of a stalemate, maybe Detmer's being a bit harsh given the

12:17.740 --> 12:21.700
very plausible criticisms of his content, but on the other hand, when you've made

12:21.700 --> 12:26.020
a mistake, you don't want it being exploited to have conclusions drawn about your character

12:26.020 --> 12:27.900
that aren't necessarily true to this day.

12:27.900 --> 12:32.780
There has been a lot of conversation about intentions, both sides have alleged that they

12:32.780 --> 12:37.460
were acting in ill intent at some point, and I don't get the impression that either

12:37.460 --> 12:41.760
of them are displaying any sort of malice, Steven's going into great depth to explain

12:41.760 --> 12:46.660
a heavily researched idea that clearly matters to him, and there's no necessity for malice

12:46.660 --> 12:51.300
if Coffee Break obtains what he envisions, Detmer probably suggests an interview because

12:51.300 --> 12:56.340
it will offer him the most unfiltered way to convey his present sentiments to ironically

12:56.340 --> 12:58.420
avoid journalistic paraphrasing.

12:58.420 --> 13:02.860
It seems at this point that with the subsequent emails, an interview is on the cards.

13:02.860 --> 13:04.860
So what went wrong?

13:04.860 --> 13:05.860
Well.

13:16.140 --> 13:20.820
When you interact with someone new, you're typically dealing with a very fragile formation

13:20.820 --> 13:21.820
of trust.

13:21.820 --> 13:26.100
You're sharing information with a stranger which makes you vulnerable to exploitation,

13:26.100 --> 13:27.680
and no one really wants that.

13:27.680 --> 13:31.760
Although I believe the conversation has been conducted fairly reasonably at this point

13:31.760 --> 13:36.200
with justified views on each side, it's also quite easy to note that the exchange

13:36.200 --> 13:37.880
is still rather tense.

13:37.880 --> 13:42.480
These guys are both very sceptical, as a smaller YouTuber you're always concerned that you

13:42.480 --> 13:47.160
could be taken advantage of with a lesser platform to retaliate, and you probably have

13:47.160 --> 13:51.400
the perception that many large creators are just corporate machines who solve their soul

13:51.400 --> 13:52.400
to get there.

13:52.400 --> 13:56.080
On the other hand, large creators are very aware of the scope on them, and a channel

13:56.080 --> 14:01.560
like Kurzgesagt's reputation rests on viewer trust, so having their content discredited

14:01.560 --> 14:03.160
is a real concern.

14:03.160 --> 14:07.000
These people don't know each other, therefore you receive the impression that all it takes

14:07.000 --> 14:12.040
is one failed communication to screw this all up, and in the end it happens.

14:12.040 --> 14:16.120
Steven writes another rather in-depth email explaining his series and content, as well

14:16.120 --> 14:20.760
as explaining his journey of research with Johan Hari, and provides the time frame of

14:20.760 --> 14:21.760
the video plan.

14:21.760 --> 14:25.600
Phillip then sends an email saying that the earliest they conduct the interview is the

14:25.640 --> 14:29.600
end of next week, and that he'll need the questions in advance.

14:29.600 --> 14:34.480
This was the last email before Kurzgesagt released his video, and Kurzgesagt's video

14:34.480 --> 14:39.040
addressed a few of the narratives that Steven wrote in his initial video, as documented

14:39.040 --> 14:40.680
in the Coffee Break upload.

14:40.680 --> 14:41.680
Steven wrote,

14:41.680 --> 14:45.720
Unfortunately, we did not reach out to scientists or do extra research on the papers that were

14:45.720 --> 14:48.320
the basis for the video's thesis.

14:48.320 --> 14:53.360
We simplified an idea so much that it made a great story, but became distorting.

14:53.360 --> 14:57.080
We often look at creators on the internet for reliable information.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.920
We rely on the fact that they're careful and rigorous.

14:59.920 --> 15:04.680
The world is too complex for simple answers, and we don't want to be the ones giving them.

15:04.680 --> 15:09.240
This led to an implied narrative that Kurzgesagt had basically used the criticisms that Coffee

15:09.240 --> 15:14.080
Break had brought up and made a response to them, while also removing the video in question,

15:14.080 --> 15:16.840
a surprising backpedal from his earlier email.

15:16.840 --> 15:22.520
Out of our work, and these two videos don't make us proud, so today we deleted them.

15:22.520 --> 15:26.520
In his emails with me, he seemed happy with the addiction video and didn't want to take

15:26.520 --> 15:27.520
it down.

15:27.520 --> 15:32.360
However, with that said, looking at the emails, it's not as cut and dry as it first appears.

15:32.360 --> 15:36.120
I think it's important to get the first detail out of the way, that Coffee Break never

15:36.120 --> 15:38.080
sent Detmer any questions.

15:38.080 --> 15:41.120
Does that mean that Coffee Break wasn't actually interested in the interview?

15:41.120 --> 15:42.120
No, not at all.

15:42.120 --> 15:46.480
In fact, I can understand that given Detmer's rather slow responses, he was under the impression

15:46.480 --> 15:50.920
that he didn't have to rush sending out the questions, but equally it did affect Coffee

15:50.920 --> 15:56.320
Break's video, because in his clips, Stephen presented it as if the conversation had closed

15:56.320 --> 16:00.760
on this agreement, and a commitment that one side had not honoured.

16:00.760 --> 16:05.160
I share with him my idea, and some of the questions and criticisms I had, and he replied

16:05.160 --> 16:08.960
to me that he would be interested in doing an interview, provided I wait.

16:08.960 --> 16:13.960
He was busy travelling, and told me to wait till early March before we could do the interview.

16:13.960 --> 16:18.760
And March 3rd was the day I found out what Philip had been really busy doing, too busy

16:18.760 --> 16:20.440
to answer my questions.

16:20.480 --> 16:26.680
But in reality, Stephen had left it very open ended, and by not providing further correspondence,

16:26.680 --> 16:29.880
he did not give Detmer an impetus to respond further.

16:29.880 --> 16:35.480
Now, does that mean on principle that he can't be angry of the video if his instinct was correct?

16:35.480 --> 16:40.400
No, but what would have been more advisable is an email to perhaps confront Detmer on

16:40.400 --> 16:44.760
the release of this video, I assume they both still had contact, and then at least he would

16:44.760 --> 16:49.000
have had the chance to explain himself, he would have been able to ascertain Detmer's

16:49.000 --> 16:53.160
position on the interview, as Detmer claimed in a statement to DeFranco that he still would

16:53.160 --> 16:54.160
have done it.

16:54.160 --> 16:55.160
We are.

16:55.160 --> 16:56.920
Naturally of note here, Philip sent me a statement saying,

16:56.920 --> 17:00.880
I didn't stall him with malice in mind, but I also didn't motivate him to work faster.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.120
Of course I wanted to have the first word on my own failings.

17:03.120 --> 17:07.280
I have been working on and off on the video since early 2017, which made it extra frustrating.

17:07.280 --> 17:10.200
So I decided to finish the video and release, it felt like the right thing to do.

17:10.200 --> 17:13.640
I never would have thought that he'd go this far and purposefully misrepresented our email

17:13.640 --> 17:14.640
conversation.

17:14.640 --> 17:17.440
It is sad this whole thing happened, I really would have done the interview with him.

17:17.880 --> 17:25.400
This was a mighty L for Steven, as now Detmer has the reasonable high ground of saying that

17:25.400 --> 17:29.080
he would have done the interview, but he won't, because of this conflict.

17:29.080 --> 17:34.120
The problem is, in this instance, what Steven did changes the perception, it makes it look

17:34.120 --> 17:39.000
like Steven did not seek resolution, more so instigation, and we don't tend to side

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
with the instigator.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.240
Do I believe he just wanted a spicy hit piece?

17:43.240 --> 17:48.040
No, in fact, in my opinion, he probably felt like he spent so much time sharing copious

17:48.040 --> 17:53.320
amounts of information with this person about what he was investigating, divulged so much

17:53.320 --> 17:57.520
of it to Phillip, and been so transparent, he likely then thought that Detmer's behaviour

17:57.520 --> 18:00.560
was in bad faith when Kurzgesagt released that video.

18:00.560 --> 18:04.400
But I still feel that even if you're doubtful about a person you're confronting, you should

18:04.400 --> 18:08.800
confront them one more time, because the worst result of a confrontation is that they provide

18:08.800 --> 18:13.600
alternative information that prevents you from making a video, and if you made a video,

18:13.600 --> 18:17.960
they would have presented the information afterwards and made you look like an idiot.

18:17.960 --> 18:21.840
Another huge problem people had with the Coffee Break video was the paraphrasing.

18:21.840 --> 18:26.280
I've always found the concept of paraphrasing in these instances to be rather weird, if

18:26.280 --> 18:29.880
you're explaining what someone was saying, wouldn't it just be easier to just show

18:29.880 --> 18:30.880
what they're saying?

18:30.880 --> 18:36.680
I mean, I digress, I get the respect for privacy, but I find it strangely pedantic and impractical,

18:36.680 --> 18:38.240
relating to situations like this.

18:38.240 --> 18:44.000
For me, confidentiality is something relating to specific topics, and if you can't explain

18:44.000 --> 18:48.120
it without leaving out details, then it makes me question whether you should be explaining

18:48.120 --> 18:49.120
it at all.

18:49.120 --> 18:53.600
He basically says, hey, the addiction video wasn't perfect, but I feel it was good enough.

18:53.600 --> 18:57.960
On one hand, I don't find this clip a huge deal, the wording would have worked if he'd

18:57.960 --> 19:02.800
phrased it as Detmer saying it was good enough to remain up on YouTube, which he does actually

19:02.800 --> 19:05.360
show at a later time on the video.

19:05.360 --> 19:09.240
But also, saying something is good enough on the quality barometer, and good enough

19:09.240 --> 19:14.460
to remain up on YouTube due to its positive cultural impact, are two very different perspectives,

19:14.460 --> 19:17.600
it wouldn't have hurt Stephen to include those extra details.

19:17.600 --> 19:21.600
On the other hand, I feel that although Coffee Break wasn't entitled to that knowledge,

19:21.600 --> 19:25.000
Detmer definitely could have saved a lot of hassle by informing Stephen that he had a

19:25.000 --> 19:30.120
video in the works that did respond to these questions, and Detmer did seem to imply that

19:31.120 --> 19:35.880
It seems like a real issue of transparency, and neither party had the assumption of trust,

19:35.880 --> 19:41.080
and when Stephen interpreted Detmer as breaking that trust, he took every single worst reservation

19:41.080 --> 19:44.920
he had of the sort of channels like Curse Gazettes and projected it.

19:44.920 --> 19:48.360
It's clear in the emails, he had done a lot of research, and I can understand why

19:48.360 --> 19:52.920
that would have annoyed him, it does derail the basis for an interview, and if Detmer

19:52.920 --> 19:57.320
stalked him and didn't disclose the information he was pushing a video through, I can understand

19:57.320 --> 19:59.600
why he'd feel a bit pissed off.

19:59.600 --> 20:03.800
And Stephen's not innocent here either, and he could have at least sought more understanding

20:03.800 --> 20:08.480
before releasing this video, but what can be understood, well, let's talk about practical

20:08.480 --> 20:11.640
details.

20:11.640 --> 20:16.740
So this all blew up on Reddit in the true fashion, with a rallying battle cry of attention

20:16.740 --> 20:21.560
brought to it, and in the classic David vs Goliath scenario, people went at Curse for

20:21.560 --> 20:24.100
what they had been presented by one side.

20:24.100 --> 20:28.840
But in this scenario, Curse Gazette was actually there to host their own Q&A, and this changed

20:28.840 --> 20:31.960
the tide rather quickly, and brought up some legitimate points.

20:31.960 --> 20:35.920
For one, unless he reused assets for which there was no real evidence of, it would have

20:35.920 --> 20:40.080
been very difficult to create a video in the space of a month, and it must have been the

20:40.080 --> 20:44.560
work for some length of time, some say it was almost two years, therefore making the

20:44.560 --> 20:49.360
whole idea that he'd just hijacked the narrative kind of unlikely, but okay, it was still kind

20:49.360 --> 20:53.980
of ambiguous at the time, because Kofi Break's points relating to the video didn't necessarily

20:53.980 --> 20:58.680
cover the entirety of Curse Gazette's video length, and at this point, both sides kind

20:58.680 --> 21:00.940
of thought it played into their hands.

21:00.940 --> 21:05.080
What we know is that from the Reddit follow-up Q&A, that Kofi Break at least provided some

21:05.080 --> 21:10.060
push for the video to come out, and the demo would have to have altered some content.

21:10.060 --> 21:14.040
Then there was this discussion about the second video included in the video as proof that

21:14.040 --> 21:16.720
Kofi Break's research couldn't have influenced it.

21:16.720 --> 21:21.020
"...dressed two of his bad videos instead of just the one, but this would make sense

21:21.020 --> 21:24.360
whether he stole my video idea or already had a video in the works.

21:24.360 --> 21:28.100
If you know two past videos are wrong, and you decide that based on someone asking too

21:28.100 --> 21:31.660
many questions, you're going to delete one of them and spin the story, it only makes

21:31.660 --> 21:33.420
sense to delete the other.

21:33.420 --> 21:36.060
So this is just evidence that Curse Gazette is smart."

21:36.060 --> 21:40.900
And honestly, here is where we see a problem forming with a lot of Stephen's arguments,

21:40.900 --> 21:43.860
is that they don't prove anything beyond reasonable doubts.

21:43.860 --> 21:47.740
I interpret this argument as implying that Detmer was smart enough to avoid the argument

21:47.740 --> 21:52.800
that he plagiarised a single video by including this extra video in his self-analysis, and

21:52.800 --> 21:54.740
no doubt Detmer's a smart man.

21:54.740 --> 21:59.260
I mean, you have to be to an extent with his work, but the problem is that it's equally

21:59.260 --> 22:04.060
explainable from a perspective that this was part of a greater video, that he had been

22:04.060 --> 22:05.220
working on before.

22:05.220 --> 22:09.820
We know that Kofi Break's criticism isn't that unique, and although Detmer may be clever,

22:09.820 --> 22:14.540
may be very clever, you don't have the evidence to prove that this was his train of thought,

22:14.540 --> 22:19.620
and that's important when you make a dark video with overdramatic music preaching about

22:19.620 --> 22:20.620
transparency.

22:20.620 --> 22:26.340
This video wasn't inspired by self-reflection on responsible research, it was inspired to

22:26.340 --> 22:28.100
cover their ass.

22:28.100 --> 22:31.260
And what's disgusting is how well this has worked out for them.

22:31.260 --> 22:38.040
Look at how celebrated they are for coming out so transparently.

22:38.040 --> 22:42.940
And I think what I find the most distasteful is not them trying to get ahead of a story,

22:42.940 --> 22:47.660
but the way they act so self-righteous and like they're such good ethical researchers.

22:47.660 --> 22:52.100
You need to have a tone that justifies the information and the level of conviction you

22:52.100 --> 22:56.440
have, and one of the biggest problems with the Kofi Break video is that it oversteps

22:56.440 --> 22:59.780
in its tone without having the conviction in its knowledge.

22:59.780 --> 23:03.580
Detmer can be criticised for sure, I don't like the fact that he stools Stephen and didn't

23:03.580 --> 23:07.640
inform him about the video, but the criticism that Kofi Break raised wasn't the first

23:07.640 --> 23:12.100
time that someone had brought it up, and therefore the claim of actually plagiarising the supposed

23:12.100 --> 23:15.020
interview seems a bit far-fetched.

23:15.020 --> 23:16.520
Criticisms aren't exclusive.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.940
When the dark tone was revealed not to be fully justified, and with the information

23:19.940 --> 23:23.960
that was omitted shown in the publication of the emails, people felt deceived, and many

23:23.960 --> 23:28.260
of these people were people who participated in a rather harsh mobbing of cursed gazettes

23:28.260 --> 23:32.680
on Reddit when the initial situation transpired, so they were embarrassed too, and a lot of

23:32.680 --> 23:34.920
people turned this back onto Kofi Break.

23:34.920 --> 23:39.200
In his tweets, Stephen sums up the main points of criticism against him, but that's the

23:39.200 --> 23:43.100
problem, although these are the roots of the misinformation, what they lead to is much

23:43.100 --> 23:46.100
more harmful when you combine it with the rhetoric in the video.

23:46.100 --> 23:49.900
If I gave some wrongful information about a group of people, and then went on a five

23:49.900 --> 23:54.160
minute rant about how this implies that the group of people are just terrible and cannot

23:54.160 --> 23:58.740
be trusted ever again, it would be much worse than if I just gave the misinformation, because

23:58.740 --> 24:04.380
the former situation requires a level of confidence that in this situation has not been well founded.

24:04.380 --> 24:08.980
This led to a lot of people implying that Kofi Break's video was created opportunistically,

24:08.980 --> 24:12.260
out of this spite that he just wanted to catch debt morale to expose him.

24:12.300 --> 24:16.180
I don't know if it's that. As said, he wore his heart on his sleeve in a lot of the

24:16.180 --> 24:21.000
emails, and I think given his other content, he didn't really have too much of a motivation

24:21.000 --> 24:26.260
to snap like that and cash in on an easy expose. He's relatively successful for his size,

24:26.260 --> 24:30.860
and his videos all typically outperform his subscriber count. His circumstances didn't

24:30.860 --> 24:35.620
really precede such an action being driven out of the motivation for clout.

24:35.620 --> 24:40.100
As Detmer said himself, it doesn't seem like malice, more just a moment of someone

24:40.100 --> 24:44.100
who's lost their temper with someone they feel has screwed them over. But what were

24:44.100 --> 24:50.820
the motivations, and what conclusions can really be drawn from this very weird and wild situation?

24:50.820 --> 25:11.420
I think as a smaller YouTuber, you tend to be cynical towards the large groups of craters,

25:11.420 --> 25:15.820
and that can be seen in Kofi Break's later tweets about that theory. Is it possible they

25:15.820 --> 25:20.500
have a little gang going on? Sure, I have my group chats in which I share intel and

25:20.500 --> 25:24.740
opinions with people, and discuss the content we're making, and the people who've made

25:24.740 --> 25:30.520
content about us. These guys do tend to engage in some agreement, but at the end of it all,

25:30.520 --> 25:35.220
if you have enough solid evidence, then you will be able to topple these people, and Steven

25:35.220 --> 25:39.860
just didn't. If there's reasonable doubt, these guys are gonna stick up for each other

25:39.860 --> 25:44.860
because they think they know that person's character better than you, and they want to

25:44.860 --> 25:50.140
support their friends. Kofi Break had the chance to gain some more elaborative information

25:50.140 --> 25:55.100
and didn't, in my opinion because he didn't trust Detmer's words, because he felt he'd

25:55.100 --> 25:59.260
been screwed over. Detmer, on the other hand, wasn't perfect in his conduct either, and

25:59.260 --> 26:03.220
I think he kind of acknowledges that. The problem was that he was clearly worried about

26:03.220 --> 26:08.540
being cancelled if his videos were shown to be poorly researched, he feels his 2015 videos

26:08.540 --> 26:12.660
don't represent him now, and they probably don't. I watched some of his more recent

26:12.660 --> 26:16.740
content, and it's well written and well referenced, but at the same time, just because

26:16.740 --> 26:20.200
we shouldn't cancel someone doesn't mean we shouldn't have a discussion about the

26:20.200 --> 26:24.780
influence they had at the time. Those videos still received millions of views, and they

26:24.780 --> 26:30.220
may not have considered the consequences at the time, but they did have consequences nonetheless.

26:30.220 --> 26:34.380
You may be able to counter criticism of your current mentality, but you can't escape

26:34.380 --> 26:39.620
what was conducted. But with that in mind, with the fact that the discussion should be

26:39.620 --> 26:44.980
about the consequences of the video, I want to ask you people one final question, does

26:44.980 --> 26:51.340
Kurzgesagt's video reflecting on his mistakes change much of Coffee Break's video? I mean,

26:51.340 --> 26:55.980
it screws up the interview, which I can understand may annoy Stephen a little, but at the end

26:55.980 --> 27:01.900
of the day, Stephen wanted to know the information from Kurzgesagt, and now he has it. If you're

27:01.900 --> 27:05.580
making a video on the actual implications of misinformation on the internet, then this

27:05.580 --> 27:09.660
doesn't affect the narrative. They still made the video, it still had major consequences,

27:09.660 --> 27:13.980
and I can't read the mind of Stephen, but I assume that's what he was making the video

27:13.980 --> 27:17.940
on. And I watched Coffee Break's uploaded video about it called Pop Science, and it

27:17.940 --> 27:22.380
covers these ideas in a lot more depth. It's a great video, he doesn't actually reference

27:22.380 --> 27:26.360
Kurzgesagt's video for obvious reasons, but it was still a really compelling video

27:26.360 --> 27:30.700
that covers the topic of simplification in Pop Science well. I mean, Kurzgesagt's video

27:30.700 --> 27:59.300
covered the criticism surface level at best. Compare these two clips.

27:59.300 --> 28:04.180
It sounds like Coffee Break's video has a lot more to reveal, and a lot more to discuss.

28:04.180 --> 28:08.660
The main point of Kurzgesagt's video is relating to how they feel about the video

28:08.660 --> 28:13.260
in hindsight, and although they reflect on some of Stephen's criticisms, they don't

28:13.260 --> 28:17.660
really nullify them, nor would I say they have stolen them from the specific context

28:17.660 --> 28:21.620
that they were going to be used from in the upcoming Coffee Break video. If everything

28:21.620 --> 28:24.940
Coffee Break had said in his initial email is true, then he shouldn't have worried

28:24.940 --> 28:29.980
about his research being undone. I get that he feels a bit monked off, but if his intention

28:29.980 --> 28:34.060
was to question the influence of creators and consequences to that effect, then he should

28:34.060 --> 28:37.980
have been fine, and he was fine. It looks like Kurzgesagt has moved on from his old

28:37.980 --> 28:41.860
mistakes and although we should always question these things as standards for all channels,

28:41.860 --> 28:46.940
I wouldn't hold it against him, and that kinda leads me back to where I started. This

28:46.940 --> 28:51.420
is not a big deal, could Phillip have been more honest? Sure, but we don't know the

28:51.420 --> 28:56.300
extent to this, and we certainly can't draw any clear conclusions on his character, and

28:56.300 --> 29:00.860
although I don't think Coffee Break made the video for Clout, it did seem rather personal

29:00.860 --> 29:05.340
on the basis that he felt like he'd been misled, and although I can empathise with

29:05.340 --> 29:09.580
the annoyance after he was so open and in depth, I think it's moments like that that

29:09.580 --> 29:13.860
if you don't care, you carry on, and just finish the video that you started on, and

29:13.860 --> 29:18.220
if you do care, you confront them, and see what they have to say for themselves. It will

29:18.220 --> 29:23.100
give you more of an outlook, and probably more to actually respond to, and now because

29:23.100 --> 29:28.620
of that, Steven has taken a fat L, but in all fairness, he owned it, and he had the

29:28.620 --> 29:33.420
humility to admit it. I'd also like to point out that this is the second incident that

29:33.420 --> 29:38.340
has been blown up by Reddit on the passionate whim of individuals without further investigation,

29:38.340 --> 29:42.260
obviously the previous one being the Matt Watson scenario, the difference being with

29:42.260 --> 29:46.460
that one, that there was no person to really provide a counter narrative because YouTube

29:46.460 --> 29:51.440
never tells us anything. This one we had Detmer responding, and changing the perspective

29:51.440 --> 29:57.060
of a lot of people, he knows exactly how to respond to these sorts of comments, and knows

29:57.060 --> 30:02.300
exactly how to blunt a lot of the criticism that was coming at him, he knows how to set

30:02.300 --> 30:07.240
points against him, and then it will lead people to build off that and then turn that

30:07.240 --> 30:12.500
onto Coffee Break. He was very very good in his Reddit Q&A, and if you want a lesson in

30:12.500 --> 30:17.780
how to respond, I know I talk about bad responses a lot, but Curskazat's Reddit Q&A was a

30:17.780 --> 30:22.660
masterstroke in how to respond. Let me make this clear, the Reddit Q&A didn't change

30:22.660 --> 30:27.060
the validity of the arguments per se, but what you saw was a load of people mobbing

30:27.060 --> 30:32.780
Curskazat without the full picture, when Curskazat was there to offer his perspective. At that

30:32.780 --> 30:38.020
point, maybe it's time to take a moment of self reflection before jumping on something

30:38.020 --> 30:43.260
we don't entirely understand, and because the whole situation was so polarised the pendulum

30:43.260 --> 30:48.020
completely swung one way or the other, one point attacking this person, and then that

30:48.020 --> 30:52.740
person, and maybe everyone was just a bit bored so they needed some drama to spice their

30:52.740 --> 30:57.420
life up, but I'd really be careful with the power of the mob, it will backfire in

30:57.420 --> 31:03.500
worse ways than this. Can we really trust Curskazat? I mean not entirely, but that's

31:03.500 --> 31:07.220
the case for all these channels, I had a friend who helped me out with some of the research

31:07.220 --> 31:11.420
for this video, who was an expert in biology, and they watched one of their videos relating

31:11.420 --> 31:15.940
to the subject, and they took issue with some of the stuff that was said, I'll leave their

31:15.940 --> 31:21.020
Twitter link in the pinned comment. However, I don't think this situation is wholly relevant

31:21.020 --> 31:25.940
to that question, because this situation is much more related to a personal dispute that

31:25.940 --> 31:31.300
was at most given the outlet in that extra Curskazat video, which will probably not be

31:31.300 --> 31:35.400
repeated. If you feel that some content is inaccurate then you have every right to express

31:35.400 --> 31:39.560
it and call them out for it, and question the influence of that content. The problem

31:39.560 --> 31:44.500
is that both Phillip and Steven themselves as people, not as channels, clearly distrust

31:44.500 --> 31:48.940
each other, and when that semblance of transparency wasn't displayed, one made the worst assumption

31:48.940 --> 31:54.020
about the other, it went off the rails, and you've ended up with this very messy situation.

31:54.020 --> 31:58.360
On the other hand, this is an easy lesson in exposed videos, if you're going to try

31:58.360 --> 32:02.920
it and prove someone isn't trustworthy and put it over in a strong tone, then you better

32:02.920 --> 32:07.120
nab the receipts baby, or you're gonna get charged, especially when the other party

32:07.120 --> 32:16.960
is more than prepared to respond. But that's the tea, or the coffee in this instance.

32:16.960 --> 32:20.800
I'd also like to add that this video is sponsored by ExpressVPN, given the recent

32:20.800 --> 32:25.160
laws that might be restricting internet usage in the future, especially the glorious incoming

32:25.160 --> 32:30.000
porn ban in the UK, such a progressive country, I thought I'd give them a complimentary

32:30.000 --> 32:33.960
plug and say their service has been doing me really well, and if anyone's considering

32:33.960 --> 32:38.960
it, you can get 3 months out of 12 months free, so basically 25% off by clicking the

32:38.960 --> 32:42.860
link in the description below.

32:42.860 --> 32:48.520
So yes, there is the video, I hope you guys enjoyed it, this one was a bit easier, a bit

32:48.520 --> 32:53.600
more easy going, which was nice, wasn't as emotionally draining, but it was a bit more

32:53.600 --> 32:59.580
contentious in many ways, because it's very easy to condemn someone who's already

32:59.580 --> 33:00.580
hated.

33:00.580 --> 33:05.760
I want to give a big shout out to my editors who have done a fantastic job, love you guys

33:05.760 --> 33:11.680
very much, you are legends, please, I'm gonna leave their links in the pinned comment, go

33:11.680 --> 33:15.360
check them out, go send them some love, appreciate them.

33:15.360 --> 33:20.560
Also big shout out to my Patrons, list up on screen right now, and I have to give an

33:20.560 --> 33:30.480
individual thanks to my $50 patreons, which are some hullabaloo, and $100 patreons, Evening

33:30.480 --> 33:38.000
Steel and Brandon are quite sensational gents, I'm very very impressed, very impressed

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
indeed.

33:39.000 --> 33:44.100
If you want to reach me on Twitter, at The Right Opinion, Facebook, I have links there,

33:44.100 --> 33:49.480
and Discord too, I try and link that, I should probably make sure the link hasn't expired

33:49.480 --> 33:55.560
this time, I get some complaints in that behalf, but yes, join them if you need to,

33:55.560 --> 34:00.400
they'll be in the pinned comment, otherwise, I don't have too much else to say, love you

34:00.400 --> 34:04.660
guys a lot, thank you for the support of recent, and hopefully by the time this is out, we'll

34:04.660 --> 34:05.660
have reached 300-

34:05.660 --> 34:31.180
Thank you for that, have a great day guys, have a great day.
