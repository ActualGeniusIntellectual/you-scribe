00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,640
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,320
too much free time, and although I don't really take requests, I still measure the

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,080
amount that I receive, and do put it into account when deciding which topic to cover.

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,640
After all, what is interesting to me needs to be interesting to you as well, and today

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,960
we have a topic that I received a disproportionately high amount of requests to cover while it

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,100
was all transpiring, but little to these people's knowledge, I was already following the situation

7
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,840
quite closely. Detective Tro is always one step ahead, anticipating each and every move

8
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,640
like a bloodhound, though let me clarify I'm not a furry, I promise guys. This is the sort

9
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,060
of drama that blows hot and cold very quickly, and I warn people who ask me to cover it that

10
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,580
this would be a while, but I still think in spite of the very momentary drama, there

11
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,680
were a lot of messages that can be taken away from it regardless of how trending it is.

12
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,100
So without further ado, I suggest I provide a quick rundown of the situation, as when

13
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,020
I posted about this in my community tab, many people were not aware.

14
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,800
This is Kurskazat, they are an educational YouTube channel ran by Philip Detmer. Educational

15
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,640
YouTube channels are pretty much as they sound, basically content that's used to educate

16
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,340
or inform the viewers. Kurskazat is definitely a significant player in this community with

17
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,260
over 8 million subscribers, they've been making videos since 2013, and their videos

18
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:37,340
typically present themselves to deliver information with a unique animation finesse. According

19
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:43,280
to them, they want to make science look beautiful, because it is. Very respectable intentions

20
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,280
indeed.

21
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,280
Arguably however, channels like his own have some of the greatest responsibility on the

22
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,420
platform to deliver accurate representation of the topics they cover, because they are

23
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:58,420
not merely opinionated, but they are supposedly factual. Many people who may be slightly uninformed

24
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,400
go into a video with the expectation that the information presented will be truthful

25
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:09,000
and honest. A high majority of people do not pause documentaries every 5 seconds to fact

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,320
check them, because a high majority of people are not me.

27
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,920
However, on the other side of the spectrum, you will face vehement inspection from ruthless

28
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,600
academics and upcoming YouTubers alike, and if you fail to deliver your content concisely

29
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,220
and honestly, you risk having your reputation completely decimated, and that's important

30
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,460
when you're a channel like Kurskazat, and that leads us to the crux of the discussion

31
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,460
today.

32
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:36,020
In October 2015, they released a video that was titled Everything We Think We Know About

33
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,920
Addiction Is Wrong, a pretty strong title, and one that they did change in the end to

34
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,040
addiction. In the video, they rebut the notion that chemicals are the main root cause of

35
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,340
an individual becoming addicted, and actually the circumstances that many of these individuals

36
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,740
find themselves in are much more influential, and we should begin to ask questions about

37
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,500
society. This was conducted in collaboration with the works of a psychologist known as

38
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,820
Johann Hari. This video grew to be one of their most successful, accumulating over 15

39
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,460
million views, pretty incredible. However, it has also been heavily criticised as being

40
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:14,460
overly one-sided in the favour of the circumstantial narrative, and arguing about it from an excessively

41
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,960
objective point of view, when there is a significant amount of dissenting evidence

42
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,320
that challenges this.

43
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,420
This is where we introduce another player into this tale, a YouTuber by the name of

44
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,300
Coffee Break, or Steven. He's a video essayist who makes content covering various topics

45
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,340
related to media. He's been going for a little over two years, and has racked up some

46
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,420
pretty impressive video performances in that time, on fairly unique, interesting topics,

47
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:43,100
nothing to be discredited whatsoever. However, he was one of the people who wasn't entirely

48
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,780
happy with Kurzgesagt's video covering addiction, so he planned to make a video in which part

49
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,920
of it incorporated his problems with that video, and the further questions around the

50
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,840
credibility and responsibility of those channels. While doing this, he reached out to Philip

51
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,180
Detmer and Johann Hari in around February of this year, to try and ascertain their opinions

52
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:07,100
from the glorious position of hindsight. After an exchange with Detmer, Steven noticed

53
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,500
that Kurzgesagt had dropped a video which directly responded to some of the criticisms

54
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,000
that he raised in his initial emails. This video was titled Can You Trust Kurzgesagt,

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,620
in which they admit their shortcomings of their videos on refugees and of course addiction,

56
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,940
before stating that they would be removing these videos from their catalogue. So in response

57
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:31,200
to this, Coffee Break uploaded a video alleging that Detmer basically hoodwinked him, taking

58
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,700
the criticisms that Steven had presented, and making a video to get ahead of him, while

59
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,540
keeping him from this knowledge, thus stalling his video. I'll be breaking down the details

60
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:45,900
of all that in a bit. This video very quickly caught fire on Reddit, and led to a huge influx

61
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:51,340
of views, and subsequently rather passionate users sharply criticising Detmer for his conduct.

62
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,300
Kurzgesagt then decided to take on criticism by responding directly, by hosting their own

63
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,660
Reddit Q&A in the moment to try and quell the outrage that was growing against them.

64
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,040
This led to them consenting the release of the initial emails, which Coffee Break subsequently

65
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,460
did. However, what these revealed was that Steven's presentation in his initial video

66
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,220
wasn't completely accurate, and left out context that could alter the interpretation

67
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,220
of the exchange. This then led Steven to receiving a heavy amount of criticism, alongside the

68
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,260
counter-arguments that it would've been very difficult for Kurzgesagt to produce a

69
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,140
whole video in the space of a month, just to deflect some criticism from an incoming

70
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,900
video. Philip DeFranco then uploaded a video where he spent the first 10 minutes dedicated

71
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,180
to this one story, predominantly responding to Coffee Break's video, and claiming that

72
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:42,260
it was a bitter hit piece which misrepresented the email exchange as well as Kurzgesagt's

73
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:46,000
response video. In addition to this, Steven posted a thread on his Twitter page in which

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,220
he placed out all his arguments and the criticisms, and then declared that he would be taking

75
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,300
a break, a Coffee Break, from social media, likely due to the spiralling situation, but

76
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,140
maybe also to focus on his upcoming video.

77
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,800
That's just a summary of the situation, and looking at it I can understand why people

78
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,840
have asked me to cover it, because there are a lot of details and nuances. However, it's

79
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,320
important to load this analysis with the fact that Coffee Break has since released

80
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,580
a video apologising, and it seems like a genuine video. I'd definitely recommend checking

81
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,360
it out, because a lot of people haven't seen it since the controversy. I'd also

82
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,860
take this knowledge into the forthcoming video. I'm still doing this because I think there

83
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,720
are some good messages to take away, and I started working on it over a month ago and

84
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,120
didn't have the knowledge at the time he was going to apologise, and some of the lads

85
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,360
put a lot of work into it, but then unfortunately one of my editors got his stuff confiscated

86
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,900
for spending 100 quid of his parents' money on wine, which is so ridiculous that it has

87
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,760
to be true, but we're here now. With that all in mind, this will be one of the more

88
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,400
inconsequential videos I make, but I still hope we can have a good old discussion over it.

89
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,880
When I first decided that I was going to cover this video, my immediate decision was to actually

90
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,240
watch Kurzgesagt's original video, and although it might not seem like the most relevant thing

91
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,880
to do, I think it's important to see if Detmer or Coffee Break's perspective seemed

92
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,620
more rational or justifiable, because Detmer was at least under the perception at some

93
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,640
point that this content was justified in its educational tone, Steven clearly felt differently.

94
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,360
I went into this video with the expectation that this video was going to say something

95
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,620
like chemical elements don't play a part, and in fact it's all completely circumstantial.

96
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,880
That was the impression I not just received from Coffee Break's video, but from Kurzgesagt's

97
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:38,560
own video, but when I watched the video I did not receive that impression at all, don't

98
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,480
get me wrong, I understand why people may have interpreted it that way, and maybe it's

99
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,940
just my mental process that takes all information in moderation, but I just felt that the greater

100
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:53,120
message was that actually we tend to pin addiction too much to the chemical causes, and not enough

101
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,880
to the actual circumstances, understanding that there are many other environmental factors

102
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,640
that increase people's susceptibility to drug addiction.

103
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,840
I mean there's the intro.

104
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,600
What causes, say, heroin addiction?

105
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,040
This is a really stupid question, right?

106
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,200
It's obvious, we all know it.

107
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,000
Heroin causes heroin addiction, here's how it works.

108
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,040
If you use heroin for 20 days, by day 21, your body would physically crave the drug

109
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,640
ferociously because there are chemical hooks in the drug.

110
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:27,000
That's what addiction means, but there's a catch.

111
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,120
Just everything we think we know about addiction is wrong.

112
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,160
But that's as close as it gets to actual denial of causation, and even then it sounds

113
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,440
like they're challenging the assumption that a person is not susceptible to addiction

114
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,120
until they try the drug.

115
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,440
Is it a biased piece?

116
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
For sure.

117
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,880
Could they have included more caveats?

118
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,880
Yes, without a doubt, but when I heard the discussion surrounding it, I was expecting

119
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,520
something much more one-sided, when all I received was an opinion backed up with evidence.

120
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,120
When we are happy and healthy, we will bond with the people around us, but when we can't,

121
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,360
because we're traumatized, isolated, or beaten down by life, we will bond with something

122
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,960
that gives us some sense of relief.

123
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,160
Maybe that's what makes the video so harmful in its narratives.

124
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,840
I'm not particularly well-versed in the science of addiction, and the fact is that although

125
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:17,060
the video does present its information in a fairly systematic, objective way, it is

126
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:23,040
also claimed to omit many criticisms and counter-narratives against not just the content, but the studies,

127
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,100
and thus push an unchallenged point of view when actually the truth isn't as clear, which

128
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,100
I can understand would be a problem.

129
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,700
Maybe the video has just done a good job at deceiving me, and I'm sure that if you were

130
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,480
to challenge the research in Johan Hari's book, you'd probably find the issues that

131
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,480
Stephen appears to find as well, and that I can understand could cause problems.

132
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,640
I also think very few people are going to challenge the idea that societal conditions

133
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,200
don't play a role in someone's increase in vulnerability to addiction, and I can understand

134
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,600
how a video like this may help people, and therefore, it does make sense that Detmer

135
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,460
may be protective of it, in spite of the possible flaws that Coffee Break was investigating.

136
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:03,420
As a perspective, it is certainly contributory, just not as universal as it implies.

137
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,780
So I guess with that in mind, we can move on to the email exchange, and ask, with context,

138
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,040
how fair were the questions that Stephen put forward.

139
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,000
This is important to understand, because the opening two emails dictate a very clear tone

140
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,620
that might imply who's being unreasonable, which can then justify later statements.

141
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,160
We can't prove any intentions, but we can definitely assemble some sort of case.

142
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,720
So here we have Coffee Break's first email, which is in my opinion fairly reasonable,

143
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,960
and straightforward in the case that it is making.

144
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,400
It outlines many of the arguments that have been made against Hari's book, which does

145
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,120
throw the original video into a contentious light, especially given its framing, and given

146
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,800
the fact that you may have misrepresented content to approximately 18 million people,

147
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,520
I mean, that's a pretty big deal.

148
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,520
So at this point, I don't believe there's any malicious intent.

149
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,360
At the end of the email, he emphasises that he doesn't want to make a gotcha piece,

150
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,080
given the influence of the video, I doubt many people would say it shouldn't be challenged,

151
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,760
whether they've moved on from that stage or not, and although these happenings shouldn't

152
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,160
be mirrored on the character of a person years later, their narrative should be reflected

153
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,120
on to make sure that other channels don't make the same mistake.

154
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,320
However, Philip wasn't really buying it, and stated the light that I saw when I watched

155
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,200
the video, that as a quote take, it can stay to exist as a helpful one, and yes, as a take

156
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,920
it works, as a philosophical point of view, a high majority of the video definitely works

157
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,120
as that, however, if the actual research that the conclusions were based on was inherently

158
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,000
faulty, then that is a problem, and it should be discussed.

159
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,400
At the end of the day, Philip does come across as someone in a bit of denial, particularly

160
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,680
when he responds and alleges that it does seem like a gotcha piece, therefore, I can

161
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,400
understand why Steven responds fairly in depth to explaining his intentions and the evidence,

162
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,840
it does seem like a pretty honest email, and goes into persuasive depth explaining that

163
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,200
he does not have malice.

164
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,560
Now, it's possible that Detmer didn't look at his channel and assume that he could have

165
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,840
been a journalist looking for a spicy headline, I mean, he does use the word journalist, or

166
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,460
he could have been well aware of Coffee Break's videos, and had a negative perception of them,

167
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:08,160
maybe he knows a school of life, and he saw his video where Coffee Break criticises them

168
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,760
pretty harshly.

169
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,700
Educational channels may already have a negative perception of Steven's work, so I think

170
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,740
at this point you have a bit of a stalemate, maybe Detmer's being a bit harsh given the

171
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,700
very plausible criticisms of his content, but on the other hand, when you've made

172
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,020
a mistake, you don't want it being exploited to have conclusions drawn about your character

173
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,900
that aren't necessarily true to this day.

174
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,780
There has been a lot of conversation about intentions, both sides have alleged that they

175
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:37,460
were acting in ill intent at some point, and I don't get the impression that either

176
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,760
of them are displaying any sort of malice, Steven's going into great depth to explain

177
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,660
a heavily researched idea that clearly matters to him, and there's no necessity for malice

178
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:51,300
if Coffee Break obtains what he envisions, Detmer probably suggests an interview because

179
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:56,340
it will offer him the most unfiltered way to convey his present sentiments to ironically

180
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,420
avoid journalistic paraphrasing.

181
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,860
It seems at this point that with the subsequent emails, an interview is on the cards.

182
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,860
So what went wrong?

183
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,860
Well.

184
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,820
When you interact with someone new, you're typically dealing with a very fragile formation

185
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,820
of trust.

186
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,100
You're sharing information with a stranger which makes you vulnerable to exploitation,

187
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,680
and no one really wants that.

188
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,760
Although I believe the conversation has been conducted fairly reasonably at this point

189
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,200
with justified views on each side, it's also quite easy to note that the exchange

190
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,880
is still rather tense.

191
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,480
These guys are both very sceptical, as a smaller YouTuber you're always concerned that you

192
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,160
could be taken advantage of with a lesser platform to retaliate, and you probably have

193
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,400
the perception that many large creators are just corporate machines who solve their soul

194
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
to get there.

195
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,080
On the other hand, large creators are very aware of the scope on them, and a channel

196
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:01,560
like Kurzgesagt's reputation rests on viewer trust, so having their content discredited

197
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,160
is a real concern.

198
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,000
These people don't know each other, therefore you receive the impression that all it takes

199
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,040
is one failed communication to screw this all up, and in the end it happens.

200
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,120
Steven writes another rather in-depth email explaining his series and content, as well

201
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,760
as explaining his journey of research with Johan Hari, and provides the time frame of

202
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,760
the video plan.

203
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,600
Phillip then sends an email saying that the earliest they conduct the interview is the

204
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,600
end of next week, and that he'll need the questions in advance.

205
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,480
This was the last email before Kurzgesagt released his video, and Kurzgesagt's video

206
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,040
addressed a few of the narratives that Steven wrote in his initial video, as documented

207
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,680
in the Coffee Break upload.

208
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,680
Steven wrote,

209
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,720
Unfortunately, we did not reach out to scientists or do extra research on the papers that were

210
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,320
the basis for the video's thesis.

211
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,360
We simplified an idea so much that it made a great story, but became distorting.

212
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,080
We often look at creators on the internet for reliable information.

213
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,920
We rely on the fact that they're careful and rigorous.

214
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,680
The world is too complex for simple answers, and we don't want to be the ones giving them.

215
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,240
This led to an implied narrative that Kurzgesagt had basically used the criticisms that Coffee

216
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,080
Break had brought up and made a response to them, while also removing the video in question,

217
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,840
a surprising backpedal from his earlier email.

218
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:22,520
Out of our work, and these two videos don't make us proud, so today we deleted them.

219
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,520
In his emails with me, he seemed happy with the addiction video and didn't want to take

220
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,520
it down.

221
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,360
However, with that said, looking at the emails, it's not as cut and dry as it first appears.

222
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,120
I think it's important to get the first detail out of the way, that Coffee Break never

223
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,080
sent Detmer any questions.

224
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,120
Does that mean that Coffee Break wasn't actually interested in the interview?

225
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,120
No, not at all.

226
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,480
In fact, I can understand that given Detmer's rather slow responses, he was under the impression

227
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,920
that he didn't have to rush sending out the questions, but equally it did affect Coffee

228
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,320
Break's video, because in his clips, Stephen presented it as if the conversation had closed

229
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,760
on this agreement, and a commitment that one side had not honoured.

230
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:05,160
I share with him my idea, and some of the questions and criticisms I had, and he replied

231
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,960
to me that he would be interested in doing an interview, provided I wait.

232
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,960
He was busy travelling, and told me to wait till early March before we could do the interview.

233
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,760
And March 3rd was the day I found out what Philip had been really busy doing, too busy

234
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,440
to answer my questions.

235
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,680
But in reality, Stephen had left it very open ended, and by not providing further correspondence,

236
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,880
he did not give Detmer an impetus to respond further.

237
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:35,480
Now, does that mean on principle that he can't be angry of the video if his instinct was correct?

238
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,400
No, but what would have been more advisable is an email to perhaps confront Detmer on

239
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,760
the release of this video, I assume they both still had contact, and then at least he would

240
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,000
have had the chance to explain himself, he would have been able to ascertain Detmer's

241
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,160
position on the interview, as Detmer claimed in a statement to DeFranco that he still would

242
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
have done it.

243
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
We are.

244
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,920
Naturally of note here, Philip sent me a statement saying,

245
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,880
I didn't stall him with malice in mind, but I also didn't motivate him to work faster.

246
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,120
Of course I wanted to have the first word on my own failings.

247
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,280
I have been working on and off on the video since early 2017, which made it extra frustrating.

248
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,200
So I decided to finish the video and release, it felt like the right thing to do.

249
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,640
I never would have thought that he'd go this far and purposefully misrepresented our email

250
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,640
conversation.

251
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,440
It is sad this whole thing happened, I really would have done the interview with him.

252
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:25,400
This was a mighty L for Steven, as now Detmer has the reasonable high ground of saying that

253
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,080
he would have done the interview, but he won't, because of this conflict.

254
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:34,120
The problem is, in this instance, what Steven did changes the perception, it makes it look

255
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,000
like Steven did not seek resolution, more so instigation, and we don't tend to side

256
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
with the instigator.

257
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,240
Do I believe he just wanted a spicy hit piece?

258
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:48,040
No, in fact, in my opinion, he probably felt like he spent so much time sharing copious

259
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:53,320
amounts of information with this person about what he was investigating, divulged so much

260
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,520
of it to Phillip, and been so transparent, he likely then thought that Detmer's behaviour

261
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,560
was in bad faith when Kurzgesagt released that video.

262
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,400
But I still feel that even if you're doubtful about a person you're confronting, you should

263
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,800
confront them one more time, because the worst result of a confrontation is that they provide

264
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,600
alternative information that prevents you from making a video, and if you made a video,

265
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,960
they would have presented the information afterwards and made you look like an idiot.

266
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,840
Another huge problem people had with the Coffee Break video was the paraphrasing.

267
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,280
I've always found the concept of paraphrasing in these instances to be rather weird, if

268
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,880
you're explaining what someone was saying, wouldn't it just be easier to just show

269
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,880
what they're saying?

270
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,680
I mean, I digress, I get the respect for privacy, but I find it strangely pedantic and impractical,

271
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,240
relating to situations like this.

272
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:44,000
For me, confidentiality is something relating to specific topics, and if you can't explain

273
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,120
it without leaving out details, then it makes me question whether you should be explaining

274
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,120
it at all.

275
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,600
He basically says, hey, the addiction video wasn't perfect, but I feel it was good enough.

276
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,960
On one hand, I don't find this clip a huge deal, the wording would have worked if he'd

277
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,800
phrased it as Detmer saying it was good enough to remain up on YouTube, which he does actually

278
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,360
show at a later time on the video.

279
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,240
But also, saying something is good enough on the quality barometer, and good enough

280
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,460
to remain up on YouTube due to its positive cultural impact, are two very different perspectives,

281
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,600
it wouldn't have hurt Stephen to include those extra details.

282
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,600
On the other hand, I feel that although Coffee Break wasn't entitled to that knowledge,

283
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,000
Detmer definitely could have saved a lot of hassle by informing Stephen that he had a

284
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,120
video in the works that did respond to these questions, and Detmer did seem to imply that

285
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,880
It seems like a real issue of transparency, and neither party had the assumption of trust,

286
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,080
and when Stephen interpreted Detmer as breaking that trust, he took every single worst reservation

287
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,920
he had of the sort of channels like Curse Gazettes and projected it.

288
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,360
It's clear in the emails, he had done a lot of research, and I can understand why

289
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,920
that would have annoyed him, it does derail the basis for an interview, and if Detmer

290
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,320
stalked him and didn't disclose the information he was pushing a video through, I can understand

291
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,600
why he'd feel a bit pissed off.

292
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,800
And Stephen's not innocent here either, and he could have at least sought more understanding

293
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,480
before releasing this video, but what can be understood, well, let's talk about practical

294
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,640
details.

295
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,740
So this all blew up on Reddit in the true fashion, with a rallying battle cry of attention

296
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,560
brought to it, and in the classic David vs Goliath scenario, people went at Curse for

297
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,100
what they had been presented by one side.

298
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,840
But in this scenario, Curse Gazette was actually there to host their own Q&A, and this changed

299
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,960
the tide rather quickly, and brought up some legitimate points.

300
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,920
For one, unless he reused assets for which there was no real evidence of, it would have

301
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,080
been very difficult to create a video in the space of a month, and it must have been the

302
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,560
work for some length of time, some say it was almost two years, therefore making the

303
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:49,360
whole idea that he'd just hijacked the narrative kind of unlikely, but okay, it was still kind

304
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,980
of ambiguous at the time, because Kofi Break's points relating to the video didn't necessarily

305
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:58,680
cover the entirety of Curse Gazette's video length, and at this point, both sides kind

306
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,940
of thought it played into their hands.

307
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,080
What we know is that from the Reddit follow-up Q&A, that Kofi Break at least provided some

308
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,060
push for the video to come out, and the demo would have to have altered some content.

309
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,040
Then there was this discussion about the second video included in the video as proof that

310
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,720
Kofi Break's research couldn't have influenced it.

311
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,020
"...dressed two of his bad videos instead of just the one, but this would make sense

312
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,360
whether he stole my video idea or already had a video in the works.

313
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,100
If you know two past videos are wrong, and you decide that based on someone asking too

314
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,660
many questions, you're going to delete one of them and spin the story, it only makes

315
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,420
sense to delete the other.

316
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,060
So this is just evidence that Curse Gazette is smart."

317
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:40,900
And honestly, here is where we see a problem forming with a lot of Stephen's arguments,

318
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,860
is that they don't prove anything beyond reasonable doubts.

319
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,740
I interpret this argument as implying that Detmer was smart enough to avoid the argument

320
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:52,800
that he plagiarised a single video by including this extra video in his self-analysis, and

321
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,740
no doubt Detmer's a smart man.

322
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,260
I mean, you have to be to an extent with his work, but the problem is that it's equally

323
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:04,060
explainable from a perspective that this was part of a greater video, that he had been

324
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,220
working on before.

325
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,820
We know that Kofi Break's criticism isn't that unique, and although Detmer may be clever,

326
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:14,540
may be very clever, you don't have the evidence to prove that this was his train of thought,

327
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,620
and that's important when you make a dark video with overdramatic music preaching about

328
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,620
transparency.

329
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:26,340
This video wasn't inspired by self-reflection on responsible research, it was inspired to

330
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,100
cover their ass.

331
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,260
And what's disgusting is how well this has worked out for them.

332
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:38,040
Look at how celebrated they are for coming out so transparently.

333
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,940
And I think what I find the most distasteful is not them trying to get ahead of a story,

334
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,660
but the way they act so self-righteous and like they're such good ethical researchers.

335
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:52,100
You need to have a tone that justifies the information and the level of conviction you

336
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,440
have, and one of the biggest problems with the Kofi Break video is that it oversteps

337
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,780
in its tone without having the conviction in its knowledge.

338
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:03,580
Detmer can be criticised for sure, I don't like the fact that he stools Stephen and didn't

339
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,640
inform him about the video, but the criticism that Kofi Break raised wasn't the first

340
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,100
time that someone had brought it up, and therefore the claim of actually plagiarising the supposed

341
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,020
interview seems a bit far-fetched.

342
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,520
Criticisms aren't exclusive.

343
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,940
When the dark tone was revealed not to be fully justified, and with the information

344
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,960
that was omitted shown in the publication of the emails, people felt deceived, and many

345
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,260
of these people were people who participated in a rather harsh mobbing of cursed gazettes

346
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:32,680
on Reddit when the initial situation transpired, so they were embarrassed too, and a lot of

347
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,920
people turned this back onto Kofi Break.

348
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,200
In his tweets, Stephen sums up the main points of criticism against him, but that's the

349
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,100
problem, although these are the roots of the misinformation, what they lead to is much

350
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,100
more harmful when you combine it with the rhetoric in the video.

351
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,900
If I gave some wrongful information about a group of people, and then went on a five

352
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:54,160
minute rant about how this implies that the group of people are just terrible and cannot

353
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,740
be trusted ever again, it would be much worse than if I just gave the misinformation, because

354
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:04,380
the former situation requires a level of confidence that in this situation has not been well founded.

355
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,980
This led to a lot of people implying that Kofi Break's video was created opportunistically,

356
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,260
out of this spite that he just wanted to catch debt morale to expose him.

357
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,180
I don't know if it's that. As said, he wore his heart on his sleeve in a lot of the

358
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:21,000
emails, and I think given his other content, he didn't really have too much of a motivation

359
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,260
to snap like that and cash in on an easy expose. He's relatively successful for his size,

360
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:30,860
and his videos all typically outperform his subscriber count. His circumstances didn't

361
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,620
really precede such an action being driven out of the motivation for clout.

362
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:40,100
As Detmer said himself, it doesn't seem like malice, more just a moment of someone

363
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,100
who's lost their temper with someone they feel has screwed them over. But what were

364
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:50,820
the motivations, and what conclusions can really be drawn from this very weird and wild situation?

365
00:24:50,820 --> 00:25:11,420
I think as a smaller YouTuber, you tend to be cynical towards the large groups of craters,

366
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:15,820
and that can be seen in Kofi Break's later tweets about that theory. Is it possible they

367
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:20,500
have a little gang going on? Sure, I have my group chats in which I share intel and

368
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,740
opinions with people, and discuss the content we're making, and the people who've made

369
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:30,520
content about us. These guys do tend to engage in some agreement, but at the end of it all,

370
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,220
if you have enough solid evidence, then you will be able to topple these people, and Steven

371
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:39,860
just didn't. If there's reasonable doubt, these guys are gonna stick up for each other

372
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:44,860
because they think they know that person's character better than you, and they want to

373
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:50,140
support their friends. Kofi Break had the chance to gain some more elaborative information

374
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:55,100
and didn't, in my opinion because he didn't trust Detmer's words, because he felt he'd

375
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,260
been screwed over. Detmer, on the other hand, wasn't perfect in his conduct either, and

376
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:03,220
I think he kind of acknowledges that. The problem was that he was clearly worried about

377
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:08,540
being cancelled if his videos were shown to be poorly researched, he feels his 2015 videos

378
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:12,660
don't represent him now, and they probably don't. I watched some of his more recent

379
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,740
content, and it's well written and well referenced, but at the same time, just because

380
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,200
we shouldn't cancel someone doesn't mean we shouldn't have a discussion about the

381
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,780
influence they had at the time. Those videos still received millions of views, and they

382
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:30,220
may not have considered the consequences at the time, but they did have consequences nonetheless.

383
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:34,380
You may be able to counter criticism of your current mentality, but you can't escape

384
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:39,620
what was conducted. But with that in mind, with the fact that the discussion should be

385
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:44,980
about the consequences of the video, I want to ask you people one final question, does

386
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:51,340
Kurzgesagt's video reflecting on his mistakes change much of Coffee Break's video? I mean,

387
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:55,980
it screws up the interview, which I can understand may annoy Stephen a little, but at the end

388
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:01,900
of the day, Stephen wanted to know the information from Kurzgesagt, and now he has it. If you're

389
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:05,580
making a video on the actual implications of misinformation on the internet, then this

390
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,660
doesn't affect the narrative. They still made the video, it still had major consequences,

391
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,980
and I can't read the mind of Stephen, but I assume that's what he was making the video

392
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,940
on. And I watched Coffee Break's uploaded video about it called Pop Science, and it

393
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:22,380
covers these ideas in a lot more depth. It's a great video, he doesn't actually reference

394
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,360
Kurzgesagt's video for obvious reasons, but it was still a really compelling video

395
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,700
that covers the topic of simplification in Pop Science well. I mean, Kurzgesagt's video

396
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:59,300
covered the criticism surface level at best. Compare these two clips.

397
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:04,180
It sounds like Coffee Break's video has a lot more to reveal, and a lot more to discuss.

398
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:08,660
The main point of Kurzgesagt's video is relating to how they feel about the video

399
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:13,260
in hindsight, and although they reflect on some of Stephen's criticisms, they don't

400
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:17,660
really nullify them, nor would I say they have stolen them from the specific context

401
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:21,620
that they were going to be used from in the upcoming Coffee Break video. If everything

402
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,940
Coffee Break had said in his initial email is true, then he shouldn't have worried

403
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:29,980
about his research being undone. I get that he feels a bit monked off, but if his intention

404
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,060
was to question the influence of creators and consequences to that effect, then he should

405
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,980
have been fine, and he was fine. It looks like Kurzgesagt has moved on from his old

406
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,860
mistakes and although we should always question these things as standards for all channels,

407
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:46,940
I wouldn't hold it against him, and that kinda leads me back to where I started. This

408
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:51,420
is not a big deal, could Phillip have been more honest? Sure, but we don't know the

409
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:56,300
extent to this, and we certainly can't draw any clear conclusions on his character, and

410
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,860
although I don't think Coffee Break made the video for Clout, it did seem rather personal

411
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:05,340
on the basis that he felt like he'd been misled, and although I can empathise with

412
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:09,580
the annoyance after he was so open and in depth, I think it's moments like that that

413
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:13,860
if you don't care, you carry on, and just finish the video that you started on, and

414
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:18,220
if you do care, you confront them, and see what they have to say for themselves. It will

415
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:23,100
give you more of an outlook, and probably more to actually respond to, and now because

416
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:28,620
of that, Steven has taken a fat L, but in all fairness, he owned it, and he had the

417
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:33,420
humility to admit it. I'd also like to point out that this is the second incident that

418
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:38,340
has been blown up by Reddit on the passionate whim of individuals without further investigation,

419
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:42,260
obviously the previous one being the Matt Watson scenario, the difference being with

420
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:46,460
that one, that there was no person to really provide a counter narrative because YouTube

421
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:51,440
never tells us anything. This one we had Detmer responding, and changing the perspective

422
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,060
of a lot of people, he knows exactly how to respond to these sorts of comments, and knows

423
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:02,300
exactly how to blunt a lot of the criticism that was coming at him, he knows how to set

424
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:07,240
points against him, and then it will lead people to build off that and then turn that

425
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:12,500
onto Coffee Break. He was very very good in his Reddit Q&A, and if you want a lesson in

426
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:17,780
how to respond, I know I talk about bad responses a lot, but Curskazat's Reddit Q&A was a

427
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:22,660
masterstroke in how to respond. Let me make this clear, the Reddit Q&A didn't change

428
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:27,060
the validity of the arguments per se, but what you saw was a load of people mobbing

429
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:32,780
Curskazat without the full picture, when Curskazat was there to offer his perspective. At that

430
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:38,020
point, maybe it's time to take a moment of self reflection before jumping on something

431
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:43,260
we don't entirely understand, and because the whole situation was so polarised the pendulum

432
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:48,020
completely swung one way or the other, one point attacking this person, and then that

433
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:52,740
person, and maybe everyone was just a bit bored so they needed some drama to spice their

434
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:57,420
life up, but I'd really be careful with the power of the mob, it will backfire in

435
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:03,500
worse ways than this. Can we really trust Curskazat? I mean not entirely, but that's

436
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,220
the case for all these channels, I had a friend who helped me out with some of the research

437
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:11,420
for this video, who was an expert in biology, and they watched one of their videos relating

438
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:15,940
to the subject, and they took issue with some of the stuff that was said, I'll leave their

439
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:21,020
Twitter link in the pinned comment. However, I don't think this situation is wholly relevant

440
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:25,940
to that question, because this situation is much more related to a personal dispute that

441
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:31,300
was at most given the outlet in that extra Curskazat video, which will probably not be

442
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,400
repeated. If you feel that some content is inaccurate then you have every right to express

443
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,560
it and call them out for it, and question the influence of that content. The problem

444
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:44,500
is that both Phillip and Steven themselves as people, not as channels, clearly distrust

445
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,940
each other, and when that semblance of transparency wasn't displayed, one made the worst assumption

446
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:54,020
about the other, it went off the rails, and you've ended up with this very messy situation.

447
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:58,360
On the other hand, this is an easy lesson in exposed videos, if you're going to try

448
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,920
it and prove someone isn't trustworthy and put it over in a strong tone, then you better

449
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:07,120
nab the receipts baby, or you're gonna get charged, especially when the other party

450
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:16,960
is more than prepared to respond. But that's the tea, or the coffee in this instance.

451
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,800
I'd also like to add that this video is sponsored by ExpressVPN, given the recent

452
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,160
laws that might be restricting internet usage in the future, especially the glorious incoming

453
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:30,000
porn ban in the UK, such a progressive country, I thought I'd give them a complimentary

454
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,960
plug and say their service has been doing me really well, and if anyone's considering

455
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,960
it, you can get 3 months out of 12 months free, so basically 25% off by clicking the

456
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,860
link in the description below.

457
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:48,520
So yes, there is the video, I hope you guys enjoyed it, this one was a bit easier, a bit

458
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:53,600
more easy going, which was nice, wasn't as emotionally draining, but it was a bit more

459
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:59,580
contentious in many ways, because it's very easy to condemn someone who's already

460
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,580
hated.

461
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:05,760
I want to give a big shout out to my editors who have done a fantastic job, love you guys

462

464

Also big shout out to my Patrons, list up on screen right now, and I have to give an

465
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:30,480
individual thanks to my $50 patreons, which are some hullabaloo, and $100 patreons, Evening

466
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:38,000
Steel and Brandon are quite sensational gents, I'm very very impressed, very impressed

467
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
indeed.

468
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,100
If you want to reach me on Twitter, at The Right Opinion, Facebook, I have links there,

469
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:49,480
and Discord too, I try and link that, I should probably make sure the link hasn't expired

470
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:55,560
this time, I get some complaints in that behalf, but yes, join them if you need to,

471
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:00,400

472
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,660
