16000	21000	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,
21000	25000	and today we take a break from our normal schedule to take a look at something that matters to me.
25000	29000	Most of my videos I put on my channel are topics that I think will have your interest.
29000	36000	This is a general philosophy because I like to entertain people and try and find a balance between what I care about and what you care about.
36000	41000	Equally it's a learning process, finding out this new information and sharing it with you guys is a great experience to me.
41000	47000	However, every now and then I know I have to make a video that won't be the most fun to make and will require a lot of detail,
47000	54000	and today is that day my friends. I held off this for a while, but I knew that I wouldn't forgive myself if I didn't actually raise my voice.
54000	61000	So let's talk about the EU, because during my time in America I've been surprised to find that maybe people do not have a clue how it operates,
61000	66000	let alone barely what it is. So consider the next 5-10 minutes a little crash course.
66000	72000	The EU is an abbreviation for the European Union, an organisation of countries that form its own absolute body,
72000	77000	often cooperating and creating legislation to maintain a more cohesive relationship.
77000	83000	It was initially born out of the fact politically, Europe has always been a bit of a mess, everyone trying to dominate each other,
83000	88000	and to provide almost a grounding central body that would stabilise the lawmaking process.
88000	95000	Very modest intentions, over the years this has developed with new institutions and initiatives being integrated and established,
95000	99000	typically through treaties or directives. Treaties are essentially contracts between countries.
99000	104000	That's a very simplified definition, but I just want you to have a general gist of what I'm talking about today.
104000	110000	The European Union that we know today was formed by a treaty in 1992 known as the Maastricht Treaty,
110000	114000	which aided the transition to the European Union from just beyond an economic community.
114000	121000	I'm not going to go into too many more details because they're not entirely relevant, and honestly it's not the most fun thing to hear,
121000	129000	however it is of importance to have some basic information so that we can apply that and think critically about what we're going to be discussing today and its implications,
129000	135000	because the European Union has been expanding that control over many different disciplines in the last couple decades,
135000	137000	and the internet has been of their interest for a while.
137000	144000	And there are many concerns over the ownership of intellectual property on the internet, given the new international realms it spans over.
144000	153000	In the past everything that we watch on TV has been through a limited number of corporations who adhere to regulations that they can be reprimanded under if they don't follow.
153000	159000	The new domains granted by the internet has created a plethora of content that is exceptionally hard to regulate,
159000	163000	however over the last few years we have become increasingly aware of this.
163000	169000	With this awareness being raised, there have been filters instated to assure that people aren't profiting off copyrighted content in many places.
169000	176000	For example, someone uploading a copyrighted song on YouTube may have it removed or monetised by the original artist.
176000	181000	The internet is a place of new opportunity, but it is also a state of great lawlessness.
181000	190000	Many of us will remember the ads they put at the start of a film, saying you wouldn't steal a film, and then trying to apply that to pirating online.
190000	194000	Because online makes all these forms of media much more accessible.
194000	199000	With this in mind, many sites like YouTube are overbearing in their imposition of copyright restrictions.
199000	206000	This creates problems for many people, myself included, when they give too much power to the actual claimant to be the arbiter of the content.
206000	213000	I've had this experience with individuals in the past, situations where I've been claimed, appealed, and the appeal goes straight to the owner,
213000	217000	and they reject it because they care about money more than they care about fair use.
217000	222000	The only way I resolved it one time in the past was by threatening a lawsuit. I don't fuck around.
222000	226000	It's pretty much understood at this point that the internet isn't going anywhere.
226000	232000	However, this also means that other competitors and governments will be under increasing pressure to respond to such freedoms with new restrictions.
232000	236000	Now, we've seen this in the US and the EU. This is not a new thing.
236000	243000	We already have copyright directives for the internet to try and prevent illegal usage of content, although it is unavoidable to an extent.
243000	253000	But the European Union really want to up the regulation, with their new copyright directive that closes in on many of the issues that they feel they haven't been stringent enough on in the past.
253000	262000	The most notorious component of this little document is something known as Article 13, which has prompted backlash and outcry against many of us internet dwellers.
262000	267000	This outrage has been amplified by a collective of media outlets that have been reporting on the content.
267000	274000	On one hand, the increased publicity will definitely make people more aware and hopefully vocal in their involvement on such European issues.
274000	284000	On the other hand, being opposed to such a thing channeled through outlets like the media can often condense concerns and mean that the problems don't resonate properly with the lawmakers.
284000	289000	Equally, it enables them to dismiss these concerns as uninformed, ignorant, and reactionary.
289000	291000	There is a sensationalist tone to a lot of reporting.
292000	302000	However, after reading the article, I think I can explain it, and hopefully make a case against the initiative, while being mindful of the possible flaws other arguments that have been put forward may have.
302000	310000	Because like many legislative bodies, the EU are extremely hard to understand, most likely, maybe intentionally, so that people never really know what they're doing.
310000	317000	But still, I bet barely any of you have actually read the article, likely because it's boring as shit, but that's what we'll be working through today.
317000	325000	I think it's also worth notifying with the disclaimer that I am a fervent Eurosceptic, I am no fan of the European Union, so there will be some points that definitely reflect that position.
325000	332000	Equally, I'll be doing my best to make an unbiased case, and anything that I do feel will attempt to be qualified off factual evidence.
332000	340000	I do not think that this legislation in particular is a compelling case for leaving the European Union, and I would urge your opinion to not be swayed by this one piece of law.
340000	346000	However, there are some greater discussions about the philosophy endorsed by the institution that can be had.
346000	350000	So without further ado, I suggest we dive into that discussion.
364000	372000	Alright, so there are a few parts to this article, 8 parts to be specific, so we're going to proceed through them in numerical order, as that seems most sensible.
372000	381000	So here is part 1, we open with a fairly routine comment that nation states are responsible to make sure that internet providers and companies are being held to account on this new initiative.
381000	388000	The second paragraph of this section requires references to another article, which we'll have a look at, under such a creative name.
388000	398000	So the directive in reference sets out the basic rules to copyright in the European Union, and in this instance the two points they're referencing are the ones being shown in the image here.
398000	410000	Now these specific parts talk about the exclusive rights for the content being held by the copyright owner, and then they list the sort of creators this applies to, and it's pretty much the usual suspects, the ones we would expect.
410000	420000	This should be quite simple for everyone to understand, you know, the rights to the money yielded from someone's creative work belongs to the creator, on principle that's fairly agreeable.
420000	426000	I think we'd all concur when I release this video that I should be able to profit off it, providing it's monetized of course.
426000	434000	Now there is a very important detail that we should consider as quote good news for us as content creators, and that's this little sentence here.
434000	448000	So just to clarify, without prejudice is a legal term for essentially not ignoring, and the exceptions and limitations in this instance are the ones being written on article 5 of the directive in reference, which does appear to protect our European brand of fair use.
449000	461000	So I want to stress, although there are some very clear flaws that we'll address soon, I would hope that this side of fair use will be protected, and the idea that it isn't addressed being pushed by some outlets doesn't appear to be completely accurate.
461000	472000	The final paragraph of this article addresses the involvement of states, and also the fact the law shall cover non-commercial uploads, which is fairly vague in it's language, and not the most appreciated.
472000	481000	One can guess that they're referencing the limitations and exceptions that are included in the other directive, which partly covers non-commercial usage that I can't be sure.
481000	490000	This is once again what has likely raised concerns with regards to the quote meme ban, however to fully understand the concern it's probably best that we just follow through to the next part.
490000	501000	So part 2 is gone, that twack can piss off, it's not our concern. Part 3 is an interesting one, they make reference to another directive, this time article 14 of another creatively titled
501000	511000	piece of legislation. What is that article about then? Well this article says that a company shall not be held accountable for the information that is posted on that site,
511000	517000	providing that they were not aware prior and they act to remove it once being aware. Sounds pretty reasonable right?
517000	523000	Well you see, in article 13 they are suggesting that with these new laws this won't apply. What does this mean?
523000	533000	It means that the websites are held accountable for the content posted, even if they're unaware that it's been posted, if it's uploaded illegally, which is a pretty tall order.
533000	540000	However, this is followed by a paragraph providing exemptions to this, which is another important clarification to consider.
540000	550000	So what is this exactly saying? Well maybe exacting it is a bit too hard, because it's more the vague expectation that somehow the rights holders are going to be providing each internet service
550000	554000	with some information that will allow them to prevent the content from being uploaded.
554000	560000	On top of this, when being notified of the infringement, they'll act to remove it as quickly as they can.
560000	566000	So essentially, we can see now that the expectations that the European Union are placing on the providers in the past,
566000	573000	they have stated that if you have copyrighted material on your site, it's okay as long as you act to remove it when you see it.
573000	580000	What they're saying now is that you have to prevent this copyrighted material from being uploaded in the first place, or else you're completely liable.
580000	588000	However, if you fulfil some vague free requisites, you're not liable, you can see why everything feels up in the air right now.
588000	593000	Well let's carry on reading and see if there's any more juicy meat we can stick our teeth into.
593000	602000	Part 5 is what I'd call the empirical clause. It acknowledges that such programs to scan content prior to upload are not algorithms that will come cheaply,
602000	608000	and would be dangerous to small businesses who do not have the resources to support such technology.
608000	618000	Once again, it's really hard to define what's gonna break the bank, the only clarification they provide within this article is the distinction of small enterprises,
618000	625000	a reference to another article which I did read, and it just qualifies what is to be considered a small or micro enterprise,
625000	629000	nothing of particular bearing on the implications of this article.
629000	637000	In a way this article could be hopeful, as it definitely gives platforms like YouTube some leeway, but it has no scope of that leeway,
637000	640000	and I'll explain why that's a problem once we're done with this.
640000	650000	So the 6th section doesn't really provide me with too much to say other than it backs up the previous articles with this idea of cooperation between the right holder and the platform.
650000	657000	I doubt it's the sort of thing that a copyright holder would actually utilise for many sites, but hey that's just my estimation.
657000	665000	Ultimately it requires the provider to give full disclosure about the nature of the copyright system they're running on the platform to the original artist.
665000	675000	Section 7 continues this narrative of the involvement of authority by saying that states have an obligation to make sure that the content of the article is enforced properly,
675000	681000	and on top of that, in instances where there is disagreement over the usage or restriction of certain content, there will be a
682000	690000	which basically mirrors the current appeals method on YouTube, where it basically becomes the legal ping pong on how fair the use is.
690000	700000	The European Union seems motivated to formalise this method by encouraging member states to create independent bodies that would determine how these complaints would be viewed,
700000	702000	which is definitely something to take note of.
702000	708000	And then we have the concluding part, which basically comments on the member states collaboration with the process,
708000	717000	basically understanding that there is a lot to be learned through this, and this final clause clearly supports the transparency of the process with which it will be conducted with,
717000	720000	and hopefully with reporting on certain information.
720000	729000	The Commission and member states will develop this idea to become more efficient, and work towards a Europe where copyright laws are more fairly and evenly enforced.
738000	748000	Now it's clear that on the surface, this article hasn't been presented with the worst of intentions,
748000	758000	they're trying to account for the possible flaws of it by inserting causes that mean online businesses will hopefully not be compromising their income by censoring every piece of creative media.
758000	764000	But this plan does seem to reflect a great ignorance held between EU executives in understanding the details of the internet,
764000	772000	and I want to be optimistic, I want to believe that they've involved lots of experts in this crafting of the article, but I wouldn't know because a lot of it's done behind closed doors,
772000	779000	and the people on the committee that proposed it in the first place couldn't even agree on its terms, which doesn't instil the most confidence.
779000	785000	At the end of the day, I want to say that they know what they're doing, but honestly I can't say that, and I'd lean towards saying they don't,
785000	791000	and that these proposed regulations represent a fundamental misunderstanding of how the internet operates.
791000	794000	What do I mean? Well I have a list, we'll get through it all.
794000	801000	On YouTube they have an ever tightening system in attempt to make sure that people can't bypass or loophole the terms and conditions,
801000	807000	and if you upload content it can be automatically matched with other content, or it can be manually claimed.
807000	811000	The system is far from perfect, it has many flaws, but that's kind of accepted.
811000	815000	Now one of the most significant issues that many of us creators have is as mentioned earlier,
815000	820000	how many of these disputes are adjudicated by the copyright claimant, which is an inherently biased mechanism.
820000	826000	The EU seek to correct this by having individual governments set up their own independent adjudication board
826000	829000	where they would question whether something is fair use or not,
829000	837000	but I'm very skeptical of how that board would operate practically given the fact that this is something that happens on an extremely regular basis.
837000	842000	As said, the internet isn't the same as television, it's not a handful of businesses arguing with a few artists.
842000	849000	There are claims, disputes, every single minute, and we are stubborn bastards, how are you going to fairly judge that?
849000	855000	And let's remind ourselves, this isn't just YouTube, this is many other sites who will have to integrate these filters,
855000	857000	and who knows how many more disputes they will yield.
857000	860000	On one hand, I want to view this article favourably.
860000	866000	I know people who've lost views, and probably money, due to people re-uploading their content on non-profit platforms.
866000	873000	On the other hand, there is a skepticism that it will be implemented correctly and with the right communication between artist and provider.
873000	878000	For example, as a creator, if someone re-uploaded my videos on their Twitter feed, I'd obviously be very unimpressed,
878000	881000	but I'd file a complaint and have it removed.
881000	886000	If you preemptively apply filters, what is going to be considered fair standards for that content?
886000	892000	For YouTube, although the standards they apply are relatively strict, they still have a reasonable limit
892000	899000	before they're picked up automatically by the copyright mechanism, so you can use clips with the chance that it's probably fair use.
899000	904000	After all, it's unlikely that you'd steal a 10 second clip as a substitute for a whole video.
904000	909000	There are no specific standards here, so the issue becomes what is classified by copyrighted content.
909000	915000	Is it a 1 second clip? If so, would we have to file an appeal into an independent bureau,
915000	921000	which has backed up with thousands more complaints about 1 second clips being copyrighted, even though it's fair use?
921000	927000	You see the problem here? The European Union haven't laid out the specific standards for what is considered copyright,
927000	931000	which is probably why YouTube are threatening to just shut down uploading for Europeans altogether.
931000	935000	I mean, I highly doubt they will, but if I were them, I'd be pretty mugged off too.
935000	942000	On sites like YouTube, things are dealt with efficiently, and really no one's uploading absolute substitute content
942000	945000	unless the video has been deleted, and even then it's normally claimed.
945000	951000	The European Union's initiative seems so vague, and they appear to outsource the power to the individual artist
951000	956000	to dictate to the provider what the restrictions would be, but then having an independent board take into account
956000	963000	possible fair use when the creator is inevitably claimed based on those restrictions imposed by the original artist.
963000	966000	So then they determine when to lower the restrictions.
966000	972000	It seems the most complicated way to apply something that has been blatantly oversimplified,
972000	976000	which is a very weird way to express my concerns, but that's essentially what they are.
976000	981000	And it's frustrating because there are the ideas of things that could be highly beneficial to creators,
982000	986000	but it ultimately ends up seeming to be bloated and idealistic.
986000	989000	The idea that we can take things down in post should be somewhat satisfactory,
989000	995000	as sites with them being considered liable now will likely censor too much to make sure they're not prosecuted
995000	1000000	for not putting the correct regulations in place, and then having some inefficient government body sort it out.
1000000	1003000	It seems like a very clumsy idea.
1003000	1007000	Now some might point out the clause of which they shouldn't implement filters if they're too costly,
1007000	1012000	but the European Union fails to clarify if they mean costly in the sense of the current business model,
1012000	1016000	or some new one that may be formed from the implementation of this law.
1016000	1020000	Let me try and simplify this because it is quite hard to get my head around it.
1020000	1028000	The EU haven't clarified whether they consider the word costly in the way that it will affect a business's net income
1028000	1034000	by costing so much to just undertake, or costly in the fact that it impacts the profits.
1034000	1040000	For example, if a site has a disproportionate amount of profits that would be hit by implementing these filters,
1040000	1045000	but those filters could prevent abuse of copyright, is that fair or not,
1045000	1049000	if the filters themselves aren't particularly costly to the company?
1049000	1055000	These filters will have direct and indirect effects, and yet there is no distinction between them in the article.
1055000	1059000	These are things that need to be explained to people, but instead it's left very open-ended,
1059000	1063000	which rightfully causes concern for businesses and creators alike.
1063000	1069000	We don't know what's going to happen. If the terms of the article were extremely clear-cut, then I guess we wouldn't have a problem.
1069000	1073000	But the problem is, as it always is, the same with net neutrality.
1073000	1077000	People don't know what's coming round the corner, which is why there are a load of operative words.
1077000	1081000	We always talk about what could happen, rather than what will happen.
1081000	1087000	For all we know, the effects may be minimal, but we can't trust them, and they haven't given us a reason to trust them.
1087000	1090000	In all candidness, it just seems like a bureaucratic mess.
1090000	1097000	With all these new supposed institutions, it just seems to be representative of an ignorance of how the internet works,
1097000	1103000	and how such an initiative will probably only affect the honest creators as the dishonest ones will just find loopholes.
1103000	1110000	There is no way to fully control what they're looking to control, and the artist will gain very little from science by censoring platforms.
1110000	1116000	There seems to be this impression that if they enact this regulation, these artists will begin to make copious amounts of royalties they've missed out on,
1116000	1120000	and I think if that's the expectation, they're going to be severely disappointed.
1120000	1124000	A response to a problem isn't necessarily a solution to the problem,
1124000	1129000	and I bet none of those people who supported this read it particularly meticulously either,
1129000	1134000	and that means we do have some more points that I want to talk about generally within the EU.
1138000	1141000	I think that whatever the implications are of Article 13,
1141000	1146000	it is the constant unknown factor that plagues creators and businesses alike.
1146000	1153000	Do I think that Google and YouTube are probably overstating the possible ramifications of the article to rile up audiences?
1153000	1157000	Sure, but equally, is this something that you're willing to test out?
1157000	1162000	And let me tell you, with the EU, it's not easy to get off the rollercoaster once you're on it.
1171000	1179000	For me, this is an even greater issue than that of legislation that's been discussed in the US,
1179000	1187000	because at least there, if it doesn't work out, you might be able to select a candidate who will try and overthrow whatever legislation you might find contentious.
1187000	1193000	I mean, not always, but at least there's some sort of grassroots movement that can reflect the popular concern.
1193000	1197000	The branch that proposes legislation in the EU is known as the Commission.
1197000	1201000	They're not elected by us, we have no power over who is in the Commission,
1201000	1206000	and so they have a lot less accountability than your standard politician.
1206000	1209000	The democratically elected part of the European Union is the Parliament,
1209000	1215000	however the Parliament have no power to propose legislation, only to vote and propose amendments.
1215000	1219000	Now what normally happens when you have controversial legislation is what happened with this one.
1219000	1222000	The Parliament voted against proceeding to further negotiations,
1222000	1226000	there were a few minor changes made, and then it was sent back again.
1226000	1230000	And this time, suddenly they've been won over, and they joyfully voted through.
1230000	1235000	Now following this, there's an additional negotiation phase between the three bodies of the European Union,
1235000	1239000	which are the two we've already spoken about, the Commission and the Parliament,
1239000	1245000	and the third one, known as the Council, which has diplomats representing each nation's interests.
1245000	1248000	Eventually they come to an agreement and it's implemented.
1248000	1252000	And this is one of the problems, who's going to repeal it once it's implemented?
1253000	1255000	That's what we should be concerned about.
1255000	1259000	If the Parliament, the only democratically elected body, can't introduce legislation,
1259000	1264000	what power do we have to reverse this? It would be a huge uphill battle.
1264000	1270000	I mean, the Commission is technically elected, but the Council are the ones who propose the politicians for the Commission,
1270000	1273000	and the Parliament once again only have voting rights,
1273000	1279000	and they have seldom really tested them because of a problem with Parliament that I'm going to describe very soon.
1279000	1285000	So there is one more vote, and I'll discuss that at the end, which is why there can't really be any chances taken right now.
1285000	1289000	Because they're not willing to be completely transparent about the implications,
1289000	1294000	we don't know what will happen, and we don't know how much chance we'll have to make these changes in the future.
1294000	1296000	That's why it's important to be vocal.
1296000	1300000	One of the biggest problems is that people aren't involved with the EU,
1300000	1304000	therefore there's very little drive to reform it in a way that we can have more influence,
1304000	1307000	and the EU itself hasn't tried hard enough to involve people.
1307000	1311000	There is a great disinterest because people don't feel like they have influence,
1311000	1315000	and why would they invest themselves when they can't affect the politics?
1315000	1317000	It's like the recycling paradox.
1317000	1322000	A person won't recycle because they think that one bottle won't have a significant effect on the planet,
1322000	1326000	but if everyone thinks like that, then there could be sizable damage done.
1326000	1332000	Many people don't involve themselves with politics because as individuals they feel their influence is futile,
1332000	1336000	and they are not wrong, but if everyone changed their mindset, then we'd have more power.
1336000	1339000	The European Parliament is all we have currently,
1339000	1344000	and maybe they'd listen to the people a bit more if there were consequences for their actions.
1344000	1350000	Unfortunately right now, an astronomically high number of people do not follow the European Parliament.
1350000	1355000	Many people do not know how it works, and therefore they push through a lot of legislation that many of us,
1355000	1357000	if we were aware of, would probably oppose.
1357000	1364000	Article 13 faces more formidable opposition because the internet hooks people up in a way that can unite a cause of interests.
1364000	1370000	But when it comes to election day, the people who voted these things through will likely face no repercussions
1370000	1374000	because people have no interest in how the European Parliament votes otherwise,
1374000	1377000	and the EU make very little effort to promote this.
1377000	1383000	Of course, when they fund some community centre in your village, they'll be sure to stick a plaque advertising their generosity,
1383000	1387000	but there is little to no interest to what actually goes on politically day by day.
1387000	1391000	People are alienated from it, and unless there are severe attempts to reform,
1391000	1395000	we will suffer at the hands of corrupt politicians who have ulterior motives,
1395000	1399000	or at politicians who are so carried away by their visions of what they want Europe to be,
1399000	1404000	that no one will stop them to perhaps reconsider how these policies will affect people.
1404000	1409000	The problem is that although we have a very concentrated vocal outcry as internet dwellers,
1409000	1413000	if we let this policy pass, and if we let politicians feel secure in their position,
1413000	1416000	they won't think about what could happen.
1416000	1420000	And unless you go out to actively vote against people who may pass damaging legislation,
1420000	1423000	then they won't have any reason to listen to you.
1423000	1429000	It's exactly why many politicians in certain countries for the last few years pass policies that hit the younger population the most,
1429000	1432000	because they're the most politically inactive.
1432000	1435000	You have to make these politicians feel responsible for your well-being.
1435000	1438000	Without that, you have to rely on their goodwill.
1438000	1441000	Look at this man. Do you trust his goodwill?
1441000	1443000	I sure as hell don't.
1443000	1446000	And you know what, maybe that's why I'm very cynical of the European Union.
1446000	1448000	I hate the establishment.
1448000	1451000	I try not to put my future in the hands of anyone else but myself,
1451000	1455000	which is probably why I do YouTube, because I have less people to answer to.
1455000	1457000	This feels like a big deal to many of us right now,
1457000	1462000	but we have to remember that, to many people, they don't watch YouTube, they'll never hear about this.
1462000	1465000	And this will be out the window by the next election,
1465000	1471000	and these people who don't know will go out next election and vote for whatever party they voted for five years ago
1471000	1474000	because there are some vague alignments with their domestic values,
1474000	1478000	even though the EU policies are a drastically different barrel of fish,
1478000	1481000	and I hope I've explained that well enough today.
1481000	1485000	So I'm going to leave some links down below where you can write to your local MEP.
1485000	1487000	Please do your best to stay up to date with them,
1487000	1490000	try not to forget about this when the next EU election comes around,
1490000	1494000	if you can vote, and if that policy has affected you negatively,
1494000	1496000	or many people you care about,
1496000	1500000	through the gain of a privileged few, then make that vote clear.
1500000	1502000	But equally, I worry that this won't be enough,
1502000	1506000	and that if this passes, it will become part of an irreversible past.
1506000	1508000	One part of me says that this should be fine,
1508000	1512000	and will find ways to negotiate a fair law that takes into account fair use,
1512000	1516000	but another part of me says it's not being assured by the current legislation,
1516000	1518000	and I don't think it's worth the risk.
1518000	1522000	I really can't see much positive yielding from this in its current form,
1522000	1524000	and I think the artists who believe they've been disenfranchised
1524000	1528000	and the legislation will generate lots of revenue will be sorely disappointed.
1528000	1531000	May the solution seem impractical and short-sighted,
1531000	1533000	and there's still time for it to be improved,
1533000	1537000	you know if you have some laws in place to expand on sites like Twitter,
1537000	1539000	I could be interested in that.
1539000	1542000	People's art doesn't deserve to be plagiarised,
1542000	1547000	but as it is, it is extremely important that we are vocal on where we stand with such laws,
1547000	1549000	and that as people who've experienced such filters,
1549000	1551000	and often their inaccurate outcomes,
1551000	1554000	we let them know that this isn't some easy fix.
1554000	1556000	Equally, it's important to look at ourselves,
1556000	1560000	see what we can do in the future to have people who will represent our interests
1560000	1566000	while also looking at the questionable democratic deficit that exists in places like the commission,
1566000	1568000	and the power that they may hold.
1568000	1571000	If you love the EU for what it could be, and want to stay in it,
1571000	1573000	then I respect that a hell of a lot.
1573000	1577000	I personally don't have the faith, but I equally accept that I may be wrong.
1577000	1580000	However, I'd also stress that if you want it to be better,
1580000	1583000	understanding the weaknesses and exactly how that can be taken advantage of
1583000	1588000	by people who may lack the experience or the ethics to behave responsibly is a real concern,
1588000	1593000	and having a more popular voice that represents all these experiences that we've discussed today,
1593000	1597000	and not just businesses and politicians, is definitely important.
1597000	1600000	We care about this, and we need to follow that through with a conviction,
1600000	1605000	and so as said, I'll leave you with the basics in the pinned comment to follow through with,
1605000	1610000	but it doesn't have to stop there, there's always more we can do, and do it if you can.
1610000	1612000	It might just make a difference.
1612000	1618000	So that was my video, my bit more serious video, but I hope you enjoyed it,
1618000	1623000	and I hope it's provided some insight, and maybe some education and some knowledge in a digestible fashion,
1623000	1625000	because I know it's quite heavy stuff.
1625000	1628000	I would love to hear what you think in the comment section below.
1628000	1632000	Once again, I want to give a big thanks to my editors, they've done a great job.
1632000	1635000	I'm going to leave their links in the pinned comment, please check them out if you have the time,
1635000	1639000	drop them in the subscription, some of them do great work, check them out and send them some love.
1639000	1642000	Also, I want to thank my Patreons, who are currently on screen right now,
1642000	1648000	they do a fantastic job of supporting me, and they really do make a difference when YouTube isn't feeling so charitable.
1648000	1656000	The one specific person I want to thank is my $100 Patreon, Ryan, who is a very lovely person, and I'm really flattered.
1656000	1661000	I'm not sure $100 is what I do with my money, but you know, wow, I love him a lot.
1661000	1665000	It really does make a huge difference to me, to have someone enthused about my content,
1665000	1667000	and it is really good to see all the feedback.
1667000	1671000	The only thing else I want to say is that future events that I'll be attending,
1671000	1678000	I'm going to be attending Insomnia, which is going to be Easter weekend, I believe, or something around then.
1678000	1685000	Also, VidCon, July the 10th to the 13th, both of those are in 2019.
1685000	1690000	I have complete intentions to go, and I would love to meet some of you guys there if you're interested too.
1690000	1695000	I don't really have much else to say, everything's going great recently with the YouTube channel,
1695000	1701000	so hopefully by the time this is up, things are still going great, though I might be cursing it, for all I know.
1701000	1705000	Until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
1725000	1727000	Bye.
