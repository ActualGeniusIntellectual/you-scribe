0	1440	very nice little
1440	3440	analytical piece
7280	11280	Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the right opinion the home of a twat with too much free time
11280	14280	And today we talk about the dying trend of Jake Paul now
14280	16960	I could have chatted about him while he was at the peak of his popularity
16960	21800	But unfortunately, I had no use and no idea what I could talk about that would be unique to my channel
21800	27560	However, the tides have definitely turned and as he slowly grows cold, I've decided to take a pop at one Pacific aspect of him
27560	31560	His media persona. Yes, he never seemed to shy away from the coverage it gave him
31560	34040	But what has really interest me is the multiple directions
34040	40360	He has taken his manipulation in and now that the Jake Paul saga has existed long enough for me to analyze the directions and not
40360	42700	Seem like a simple cash in that's what I'm going to do
42700	48620	The first time Jake Paul had his full-blown run-in with the mainstream media was when they went to report on his supposed neighborhood
48840	55440	Disturbances and the undeniable commotion that he was instigating now the news sources that reported painted a fairly negative picture and appropriately
55440	62040	So his actions were completely reckless and when the news crews were there, he didn't do anything to contradict that idea of him
62040	65380	So, how did he respond? Well, let's talk about that now
65380	69520	You have to know the Jakey here has completely fickle fans who will eat up whatever he dishes out
69520	74280	This is important because they need to be completely committed so that even when he acts like a total jerk
74280	77560	They're there to dab on the haters or as I like to call them critics
77560	82040	So I expected a wholly overblown response in video form and that is what he gave us
82040	84680	However, he coasted off a very sneaky narrative
84720	90080	We all know that trusted mainstream media is at an all-time low. That's nothing new, but Jake Paul made it something new
90080	96080	He worked off the flawed enemy of enemy narrative and faked a police incident to serve as example for how the media can exploit
96320	101240	Misreporting escapades this narrative worked for his fans. They ate it up because mainstream media is bad
101240	107440	But even though mainstream media is undeniably terrible a broken clock is still right twice a day and just because like you and I
107440	112280	They hate the mainstream media doesn't mean that it vindicated any of Jake Paul's irresponsible actions
112280	115040	Now I considered Jake Paul a bit of a malleable character
115040	120020	He evolves into every situation the persona that he portrayed on his channel was one of extreme calculation
120020	121480	He knew that he could get away with such
121480	128280	fallacious behavior there and then and this is important to note because during his appearance on the h3 podcast he acts completely different and
128280	132720	This vivacious big kid is replaced by a moderately remorseful gentleman who daments over his actions
132720	138360	Like most regular people would suddenly because he's on h3's patch and he knows that he'll have a lot of people who are skeptical
139080	144380	He not only sees it as a way to scrounge whatever reputation he has but also a way to attain some new
144600	150200	Subscribers through emotional outreach and now we talk about his third maneuver the phase banks assault claims now
150200	153920	Jake Paul knows that he wasn't positioned too strongly within the media with regards to this
153920	160000	So, how does he create drama and still keep everyone on their toes exactly? Well very smartly indeed
160000	166000	He first brings the alleged victim into his video and does the normal shtick of being Solomon serious and talking about how these things
166000	169800	Are wrong, however, he knows that he's not really a voice of legitimacy beyond his channel
169800	173800	So what he does is he throws Erica Castell in there not only because she's not him
173800	178400	But also because females are normally better for discussing these situations and attracting sympathy
178400	183880	It also helps that Erica Castell is a newer face to the media and therefore a lot of people who are not familiar with team
183880	188400	10 beyond Jake Paul won't immediately judge her like they do with our little title character here
188400	193180	The estrangement is essential for this message to connect and this signifies a trend for Jake Paul
193220	197380	His channel messages are very shallow and vapid they're easy to pick apart and childish
197380	200580	But he can do them on his channel because he's watched by a bunch of children
200580	200980	however
200980	206020	as soon as he steps outside the domain of his channel he has to drop that facade and act like an adult or get other
206020	210460	People to act like adults for him if his reputation is too tainted in that area already
210460	213860	I have no time for Jake Paul or any of his antics
213860	218780	He's a cunt for money and then acts all humble as soon as he steps outside his channel on a side note the most
218780	222140	Loathsome aspect of him is the fact that he always uses good deeds as
222220	227580	scapegoats for being a cunt if you do a few good deeds here and there it doesn't undermine the numerous times you've acted like a
227660	232720	Juvenile manchild, but that's a different point for a different day and probably for a different channel
232960	236300	Anyway, when for something a bit more YouTube related as I felt I could pull it off
236300	240960	I hope you enjoyed and if you have any additional thoughts drop them my way until then
240960	243460	I'm the right opinion and I'll see you in the next one
