00:00.000 --> 00:01.440
very nice little

00:01.440 --> 00:03.440
analytical piece

00:07.280 --> 00:11.280
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the right opinion the home of a twat with too much free time

00:11.280 --> 00:14.280
And today we talk about the dying trend of Jake Paul now

00:14.280 --> 00:16.960
I could have chatted about him while he was at the peak of his popularity

00:16.960 --> 00:21.800
But unfortunately, I had no use and no idea what I could talk about that would be unique to my channel

00:21.800 --> 00:27.560
However, the tides have definitely turned and as he slowly grows cold, I've decided to take a pop at one Pacific aspect of him

00:27.560 --> 00:31.560
His media persona. Yes, he never seemed to shy away from the coverage it gave him

00:31.560 --> 00:34.040
But what has really interest me is the multiple directions

00:34.040 --> 00:40.360
He has taken his manipulation in and now that the Jake Paul saga has existed long enough for me to analyze the directions and not

00:40.360 --> 00:42.700
Seem like a simple cash in that's what I'm going to do

00:42.700 --> 00:48.620
The first time Jake Paul had his full-blown run-in with the mainstream media was when they went to report on his supposed neighborhood

00:48.840 --> 00:55.440
Disturbances and the undeniable commotion that he was instigating now the news sources that reported painted a fairly negative picture and appropriately

00:55.440 --> 01:02.040
So his actions were completely reckless and when the news crews were there, he didn't do anything to contradict that idea of him

01:02.040 --> 01:05.380
So, how did he respond? Well, let's talk about that now

01:05.380 --> 01:09.520
You have to know the Jakey here has completely fickle fans who will eat up whatever he dishes out

01:09.520 --> 01:14.280
This is important because they need to be completely committed so that even when he acts like a total jerk

01:14.280 --> 01:17.560
They're there to dab on the haters or as I like to call them critics

01:17.560 --> 01:22.040
So I expected a wholly overblown response in video form and that is what he gave us

01:22.040 --> 01:24.680
However, he coasted off a very sneaky narrative

01:24.720 --> 01:30.080
We all know that trusted mainstream media is at an all-time low. That's nothing new, but Jake Paul made it something new

01:30.080 --> 01:36.080
He worked off the flawed enemy of enemy narrative and faked a police incident to serve as example for how the media can exploit

01:36.320 --> 01:41.240
Misreporting escapades this narrative worked for his fans. They ate it up because mainstream media is bad

01:41.240 --> 01:47.440
But even though mainstream media is undeniably terrible a broken clock is still right twice a day and just because like you and I

01:47.440 --> 01:52.280
They hate the mainstream media doesn't mean that it vindicated any of Jake Paul's irresponsible actions

01:52.280 --> 01:55.040
Now I considered Jake Paul a bit of a malleable character

01:55.040 --> 02:00.020
He evolves into every situation the persona that he portrayed on his channel was one of extreme calculation

02:00.020 --> 02:01.480
He knew that he could get away with such

02:01.480 --> 02:08.280
fallacious behavior there and then and this is important to note because during his appearance on the h3 podcast he acts completely different and

02:08.280 --> 02:12.720
This vivacious big kid is replaced by a moderately remorseful gentleman who daments over his actions

02:12.720 --> 02:18.360
Like most regular people would suddenly because he's on h3's patch and he knows that he'll have a lot of people who are skeptical

02:19.080 --> 02:24.380
He not only sees it as a way to scrounge whatever reputation he has but also a way to attain some new

02:24.600 --> 02:30.200
Subscribers through emotional outreach and now we talk about his third maneuver the phase banks assault claims now

02:30.200 --> 02:33.920
Jake Paul knows that he wasn't positioned too strongly within the media with regards to this

02:33.920 --> 02:40.000
So, how does he create drama and still keep everyone on their toes exactly? Well very smartly indeed

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
He first brings the alleged victim into his video and does the normal shtick of being Solomon serious and talking about how these things

02:46.000 --> 02:49.800
Are wrong, however, he knows that he's not really a voice of legitimacy beyond his channel

02:49.800 --> 02:53.800
So what he does is he throws Erica Castell in there not only because she's not him

02:53.800 --> 02:58.400
But also because females are normally better for discussing these situations and attracting sympathy

02:58.400 --> 03:03.880
It also helps that Erica Castell is a newer face to the media and therefore a lot of people who are not familiar with team

03:03.880 --> 03:08.400
10 beyond Jake Paul won't immediately judge her like they do with our little title character here

03:08.400 --> 03:13.180
The estrangement is essential for this message to connect and this signifies a trend for Jake Paul

03:13.220 --> 03:17.380
His channel messages are very shallow and vapid they're easy to pick apart and childish

03:17.380 --> 03:20.580
But he can do them on his channel because he's watched by a bunch of children

03:20.580 --> 03:20.980
however

03:20.980 --> 03:26.020
as soon as he steps outside the domain of his channel he has to drop that facade and act like an adult or get other

03:26.020 --> 03:30.460
People to act like adults for him if his reputation is too tainted in that area already

03:30.460 --> 03:33.860
I have no time for Jake Paul or any of his antics

03:33.860 --> 03:38.780
He's a cunt for money and then acts all humble as soon as he steps outside his channel on a side note the most

03:38.780 --> 03:42.140
Loathsome aspect of him is the fact that he always uses good deeds as

03:42.220 --> 03:47.580
scapegoats for being a cunt if you do a few good deeds here and there it doesn't undermine the numerous times you've acted like a

03:47.660 --> 03:52.720
Juvenile manchild, but that's a different point for a different day and probably for a different channel

03:52.960 --> 03:56.300
Anyway, when for something a bit more YouTube related as I felt I could pull it off

03:56.300 --> 04:00.960
I hope you enjoyed and if you have any additional thoughts drop them my way until then

04:00.960 --> 04:03.460
I'm the right opinion and I'll see you in the next one
