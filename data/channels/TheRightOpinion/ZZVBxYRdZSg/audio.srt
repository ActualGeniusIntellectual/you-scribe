00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
very nice little

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,440
analytical piece

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,280
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the right opinion the home of a twat with too much free time

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,280
And today we talk about the dying trend of Jake Paul now

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,960
I could have chatted about him while he was at the peak of his popularity

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,800
But unfortunately, I had no use and no idea what I could talk about that would be unique to my channel

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,560
However, the tides have definitely turned and as he slowly grows cold, I've decided to take a pop at one Pacific aspect of him

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,560
His media persona. Yes, he never seemed to shy away from the coverage it gave him

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,040
But what has really interest me is the multiple directions

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:40,360
He has taken his manipulation in and now that the Jake Paul saga has existed long enough for me to analyze the directions and not

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,700
Seem like a simple cash in that's what I'm going to do

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:48,620
The first time Jake Paul had his full-blown run-in with the mainstream media was when they went to report on his supposed neighborhood

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,440
Disturbances and the undeniable commotion that he was instigating now the news sources that reported painted a fairly negative picture and appropriately

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,040
So his actions were completely reckless and when the news crews were there, he didn't do anything to contradict that idea of him

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,380
So, how did he respond? Well, let's talk about that now

16
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:09,520
You have to know the Jakey here has completely fickle fans who will eat up whatever he dishes out

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,280
This is important because they need to be completely committed so that even when he acts like a total jerk

18
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,560
They're there to dab on the haters or as I like to call them critics

19
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,040
So I expected a wholly overblown response in video form and that is what he gave us

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,680
However, he coasted off a very sneaky narrative

21
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,080
We all know that trusted mainstream media is at an all-time low. That's nothing new, but Jake Paul made it something new

22
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,080
He worked off the flawed enemy of enemy narrative and faked a police incident to serve as example for how the media can exploit

23
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,240
Misreporting escapades this narrative worked for his fans. They ate it up because mainstream media is bad

24
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:47,440
But even though mainstream media is undeniably terrible a broken clock is still right twice a day and just because like you and I

25
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,280
They hate the mainstream media doesn't mean that it vindicated any of Jake Paul's irresponsible actions

26
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,040
Now I considered Jake Paul a bit of a malleable character

27
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,020
He evolves into every situation the persona that he portrayed on his channel was one of extreme calculation

28
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,480
He knew that he could get away with such

29
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:08,280
fallacious behavior there and then and this is important to note because during his appearance on the h3 podcast he acts completely different and

30
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,720
This vivacious big kid is replaced by a moderately remorseful gentleman who daments over his actions

31
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,360
Like most regular people would suddenly because he's on h3's patch and he knows that he'll have a lot of people who are skeptical

32
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,380
He not only sees it as a way to scrounge whatever reputation he has but also a way to attain some new

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:30,200
Subscribers through emotional outreach and now we talk about his third maneuver the phase banks assault claims now

34
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,920
Jake Paul knows that he wasn't positioned too strongly within the media with regards to this

35
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,000
So, how does he create drama and still keep everyone on their toes exactly? Well very smartly indeed

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
He first brings the alleged victim into his video and does the normal shtick of being Solomon serious and talking about how these things

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,800
Are wrong, however, he knows that he's not really a voice of legitimacy beyond his channel

38
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,800
So what he does is he throws Erica Castell in there not only because she's not him

39
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,400
But also because females are normally better for discussing these situations and attracting sympathy

40
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,880
It also helps that Erica Castell is a newer face to the media and therefore a lot of people who are not familiar with team

41
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,400
10 beyond Jake Paul won't immediately judge her like they do with our little title character here

42
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,180
The estrangement is essential for this message to connect and this signifies a trend for Jake Paul

43
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,380
His channel messages are very shallow and vapid they're easy to pick apart and childish

44
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,580
But he can do them on his channel because he's watched by a bunch of children

45
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:20,980
however

46
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,020
as soon as he steps outside the domain of his channel he has to drop that facade and act like an adult or get other

47
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,460
People to act like adults for him if his reputation is too tainted in that area already

48
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,860
I have no time for Jake Paul or any of his antics

49
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,780
He's a cunt for money and then acts all humble as soon as he steps outside his channel on a side note the most

50
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,140
Loathsome aspect of him is the fact that he always uses good deeds as

51
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,580
scapegoats for being a cunt if you do a few good deeds here and there it doesn't undermine the numerous times you've acted like a

52
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,720
Juvenile manchild, but that's a different point for a different day and probably for a different channel

53
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,300
Anyway, when for something a bit more YouTube related as I felt I could pull it off

54
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,960
I hope you enjoyed and if you have any additional thoughts drop them my way until then

55
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,460
I'm the right opinion and I'll see you in the next one
