00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
You know what I say? Time to ban them.

00:02.280 --> 00:11.480
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

00:11.480 --> 00:15.680
and today we reflect on a recent tragedy, and some of the more tragic responses.

00:15.680 --> 00:21.160
I didn't think I'd be returning to this topic as soon as I am, I thought I'd cover the most reasoned and contentious

00:21.160 --> 00:27.400
arguments for and against gun control in a fairly recent video, and to be honest, I did, which is why I'm not addressing that today.

00:27.400 --> 00:34.080
However, there is increasing pressure on certain individuals to concede and bring in some restrictions, and that is understandable.

00:34.080 --> 00:40.080
Now, the response has been a mix, where some have considered such changes, and others have expressed why they feel those changes

00:40.080 --> 00:46.000
would be detrimental to public safety, or why they might be ineffective, a few have considered deflecting the issue

00:46.000 --> 00:49.880
completely onto something rather unrelated, this being gaming.

00:49.880 --> 00:55.880
What was the instant in particular that caught my eye then? Well, it was this little blight of a piece, or a statement even,

00:55.920 --> 01:02.920
by Matt Bevan, who in response to the recent shooting, decided that one of the most dangerous influences on children's feeble,

01:02.920 --> 01:05.720
impressionable minds were the presence of video games.

01:05.720 --> 01:12.720
Appearing on a local TV station, he states that there are violent video games listed for adults, but children can play them, the sin,

01:12.720 --> 01:19.160
and then points out that there are video games that reward players for killing other players, and that these games are being forced down our throats

01:19.160 --> 01:25.280
under the damned notion of free speech, and that apparently they have desensitised people to the value of human life,

01:25.280 --> 01:28.960
and so much of the strong morals that we need in the land of the free.

01:28.960 --> 01:34.400
There are many flaws to his statements, and I could address them all, but most of his flaws are fairly self-explanatory,

01:34.400 --> 01:40.520
but it has been an age-old belief that somehow violent video games inspire real-life violence on a regular basis.

01:40.520 --> 01:47.040
Criminology has shown the relationship as complex, there have been individual incidents where people have attempted to mimic

01:47.040 --> 01:53.720
certain actions shown in video games with tragic results, however those examples are generally over-represented in modern media,

01:53.720 --> 02:00.280
as they are rather exceptional. Then we talk about the general notion of violence, and this is where a huge logical misinterpretation

02:00.280 --> 02:03.440
has occurred for a while, and one that needed to be corrected.

02:03.440 --> 02:09.160
Many studies found that after a gaming session, children would be prone to higher aggression, and therefore certain politicians

02:09.160 --> 02:14.200
began to push this anti-video games narrative. What people have confused here were two things.

02:14.200 --> 02:20.280
Firstly, that short-term stimulation was not indicative of a long-term response, children were more likely to be stimulated

02:20.280 --> 02:25.320
after coming off a video game, but that doesn't imply that their behaviour would alter outside of the medium,

02:25.320 --> 02:31.640
or even that it would influence their levels of aggression as fully developed adults, and the studies into that have been very mixed

02:31.640 --> 02:35.960
and inconclusive, with many actually finding no correlation whatsoever.

02:35.960 --> 02:43.640
The second mistake they didn't recognise was that violence-inspired simulation and violence-inspired mimicry are two very different concepts.

02:43.640 --> 02:49.160
Anything can stimulate us to be in the mood to do something, whereas only specific scenarios could be put down

02:49.160 --> 02:56.200
to video game-inspired predicaments. And, of course, in the instances outside video game-inspired mimicry,

02:56.200 --> 03:01.160
which there are very few examples of that I've just spoken about, if we want to talk about stimulation,

03:01.160 --> 03:07.640
there are many other influences at that point. Comparatively, there are a lot more mass shootings in America.

03:07.640 --> 03:12.040
There are many facilitators to creating that environment. What do I mean by that?

03:12.040 --> 03:18.120
Well, every tragedy is the result of a probabilistic outcome. I know it sounds inhumane, but it is true.

03:18.120 --> 03:22.280
So many conditions go into creating a scenario where a mass shooting can occur.

03:22.280 --> 03:27.160
Now, what we have to do is outline the current factor that is making it disproportionately high in the US,

03:27.160 --> 03:32.600
and working out how to reduce it. Now, I'm not going to discuss that today, as I said I've discussed that in the past.

03:32.600 --> 03:40.280
However, by looking at the scenario and concluding that video games are the main factor contributing to the high mass shooting rate in the US is delusional.

03:40.280 --> 03:45.960
Why is that? Well, there are many reasons. Firstly, because video games have a medium that can be measured internationally,

03:45.960 --> 03:53.480
in countries with different laws and henceforth different conditions. Now, if we went over to the UK, South Korea, or many other countries where video games are popular,

03:53.480 --> 04:00.920
we'd notice that even a similar level of game ownership does not create a similar outcome, even if there are different genres, for example.

04:00.920 --> 04:06.920
Now, what we have done there is disproved a sole cause situation, but we haven't directly disproved a first cause situation.

04:06.920 --> 04:10.520
What do I mean by that? Well, if I was to present that argument, someone may say,

04:10.520 --> 04:15.480
yes, the gun laws definitely create an increased likelihood for shooting than other countries with tighter laws.

04:15.480 --> 04:20.280
However, if children had better influences growing up, then they'd be more responsible with guns.

04:20.280 --> 04:24.760
And in a way, that is what the Kentucky governor was trying to hint at. But this is the problem.

04:24.760 --> 04:28.520
If there is a lapse in another area, I do not think it is video games.

04:28.520 --> 04:32.280
I feel there are many societal problems within the US that could influence children.

04:32.280 --> 04:40.200
But if we are to take the probabilistic formula that we mentioned earlier, we'd notice that even nationally, a lot of children play video games not suitable for their age range.

04:40.200 --> 04:45.640
There is an extremely negligible relationship, maybe none at all, between that and mass shootings.

04:45.640 --> 04:53.160
Blaming video games is completely irrational, and yes, this argument could be applied to other aspects of antisocial behaviour.

04:53.160 --> 04:57.880
But once again, I believe that even if an action was supposedly inspired by a video game,

04:57.880 --> 05:02.760
to then imply that somehow they have had a decisive influence is unfounded.

05:02.760 --> 05:07.240
Media does have its influences. It's unavoidable, as I said in a previous video,

05:07.240 --> 05:13.240
but you have to understand that there are other influences, particularly in preventing shootings, that could be taken of note before.

05:13.240 --> 05:20.440
I think that video games aren't just a cog in a very complex contraption, and to somehow try to control it would have very little effect whatsoever.

05:20.440 --> 05:26.920
And then on top of that, my question to the Kentucky governor, even if this was all completely true, how do you control it?

05:26.920 --> 05:33.240
Someone's house is their private sphere, you can't go around looking through people's windows and working out what games their children are playing.

05:33.240 --> 05:37.560
You can promote a certain attitude, but that has been eroded away for a long time.

05:37.560 --> 05:41.800
Not through video games alone, it can be witnessed everywhere in society.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.280
Unfortunately, it is the century we live in.

05:44.280 --> 05:50.840
For most school shooters, for most terrorists, for most individuals who cause exceptional grief within societies,

05:50.840 --> 05:58.920
it's a very long chain of events that predated the existence of video games within their lives, and that's something that Matt Bevin needs to grasp.

05:58.920 --> 06:04.280
I believe some people have biological ability to cause excessive pain, whereas others don't.

06:04.280 --> 06:10.120
But for those who do, it's a long chain of prerequisites from there that are needed to activate such an insanity.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.560
For Cruz, the activation likely started when he was orphaned.

06:13.560 --> 06:23.320
Most psychologists agree the first two years are a critical time in a child's life, and with no real parental connection within that, what started was a long chain of events.

06:23.320 --> 06:27.240
Does this mean we shouldn't discuss certain situational factors that we can change?

06:27.240 --> 06:33.080
No, we can definitely start a discussion in how to prevent someone like him from ever ending up in that situation,

06:33.080 --> 06:42.280
but to focus on the trivial matters like video games is focusing on something so sketchy that it almost seems like Mr Bevin wanted to change the discussion from what should be spoken about.

06:42.280 --> 06:51.240
And regardless of what you think, it's a chat worth having, and these distraction techniques are just going to hold up that important discourse, but it will never prevent it.

06:51.240 --> 06:54.760
It's pointless stalling, it's a risky game he's playing.

06:54.760 --> 07:00.600
I've covered this before, but America is in a unique situation that needs new, unique discussions to be held.

07:00.600 --> 07:07.160
Video games are not unique, and I don't think the circumstance even within that context makes them unique either.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.120
It's time to drop the bullshit and get to the point.

07:10.120 --> 07:15.640
Anyway, I would love to hear your thoughts on this, what do you think America's biggest problem that it needs to navigate?

07:15.640 --> 07:18.600
As long as it's not video games, then I would love to hear down below.

07:18.600 --> 07:22.760
Until then, however, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

07:24.760 --> 07:36.520
Thanks for watching guys!
