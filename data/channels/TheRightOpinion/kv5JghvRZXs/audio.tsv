0	2280	You know what I say? Time to ban them.
2280	11480	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,
11480	15680	and today we reflect on a recent tragedy, and some of the more tragic responses.
15680	21160	I didn't think I'd be returning to this topic as soon as I am, I thought I'd cover the most reasoned and contentious
21160	27400	arguments for and against gun control in a fairly recent video, and to be honest, I did, which is why I'm not addressing that today.
27400	34080	However, there is increasing pressure on certain individuals to concede and bring in some restrictions, and that is understandable.
34080	40080	Now, the response has been a mix, where some have considered such changes, and others have expressed why they feel those changes
40080	46000	would be detrimental to public safety, or why they might be ineffective, a few have considered deflecting the issue
46000	49880	completely onto something rather unrelated, this being gaming.
49880	55880	What was the instant in particular that caught my eye then? Well, it was this little blight of a piece, or a statement even,
55920	62920	by Matt Bevan, who in response to the recent shooting, decided that one of the most dangerous influences on children's feeble,
62920	65720	impressionable minds were the presence of video games.
65720	72720	Appearing on a local TV station, he states that there are violent video games listed for adults, but children can play them, the sin,
72720	79160	and then points out that there are video games that reward players for killing other players, and that these games are being forced down our throats
79160	85280	under the damned notion of free speech, and that apparently they have desensitised people to the value of human life,
85280	88960	and so much of the strong morals that we need in the land of the free.
88960	94400	There are many flaws to his statements, and I could address them all, but most of his flaws are fairly self-explanatory,
94400	100520	but it has been an age-old belief that somehow violent video games inspire real-life violence on a regular basis.
100520	107040	Criminology has shown the relationship as complex, there have been individual incidents where people have attempted to mimic
107040	113720	certain actions shown in video games with tragic results, however those examples are generally over-represented in modern media,
113720	120280	as they are rather exceptional. Then we talk about the general notion of violence, and this is where a huge logical misinterpretation
120280	123440	has occurred for a while, and one that needed to be corrected.
123440	129160	Many studies found that after a gaming session, children would be prone to higher aggression, and therefore certain politicians
129160	134200	began to push this anti-video games narrative. What people have confused here were two things.
134200	140280	Firstly, that short-term stimulation was not indicative of a long-term response, children were more likely to be stimulated
140280	145320	after coming off a video game, but that doesn't imply that their behaviour would alter outside of the medium,
145320	151640	or even that it would influence their levels of aggression as fully developed adults, and the studies into that have been very mixed
151640	155960	and inconclusive, with many actually finding no correlation whatsoever.
155960	163640	The second mistake they didn't recognise was that violence-inspired simulation and violence-inspired mimicry are two very different concepts.
163640	169160	Anything can stimulate us to be in the mood to do something, whereas only specific scenarios could be put down
169160	176200	to video game-inspired predicaments. And, of course, in the instances outside video game-inspired mimicry,
176200	181160	which there are very few examples of that I've just spoken about, if we want to talk about stimulation,
181160	187640	there are many other influences at that point. Comparatively, there are a lot more mass shootings in America.
187640	192040	There are many facilitators to creating that environment. What do I mean by that?
192040	198120	Well, every tragedy is the result of a probabilistic outcome. I know it sounds inhumane, but it is true.
198120	202280	So many conditions go into creating a scenario where a mass shooting can occur.
202280	207160	Now, what we have to do is outline the current factor that is making it disproportionately high in the US,
207160	212600	and working out how to reduce it. Now, I'm not going to discuss that today, as I said I've discussed that in the past.
212600	220280	However, by looking at the scenario and concluding that video games are the main factor contributing to the high mass shooting rate in the US is delusional.
220280	225960	Why is that? Well, there are many reasons. Firstly, because video games have a medium that can be measured internationally,
225960	233480	in countries with different laws and henceforth different conditions. Now, if we went over to the UK, South Korea, or many other countries where video games are popular,
233480	240920	we'd notice that even a similar level of game ownership does not create a similar outcome, even if there are different genres, for example.
240920	246920	Now, what we have done there is disproved a sole cause situation, but we haven't directly disproved a first cause situation.
246920	250520	What do I mean by that? Well, if I was to present that argument, someone may say,
250520	255480	yes, the gun laws definitely create an increased likelihood for shooting than other countries with tighter laws.
255480	260280	However, if children had better influences growing up, then they'd be more responsible with guns.
260280	264760	And in a way, that is what the Kentucky governor was trying to hint at. But this is the problem.
264760	268520	If there is a lapse in another area, I do not think it is video games.
268520	272280	I feel there are many societal problems within the US that could influence children.
272280	280200	But if we are to take the probabilistic formula that we mentioned earlier, we'd notice that even nationally, a lot of children play video games not suitable for their age range.
280200	285640	There is an extremely negligible relationship, maybe none at all, between that and mass shootings.
285640	293160	Blaming video games is completely irrational, and yes, this argument could be applied to other aspects of antisocial behaviour.
293160	297880	But once again, I believe that even if an action was supposedly inspired by a video game,
297880	302760	to then imply that somehow they have had a decisive influence is unfounded.
302760	307240	Media does have its influences. It's unavoidable, as I said in a previous video,
307240	313240	but you have to understand that there are other influences, particularly in preventing shootings, that could be taken of note before.
313240	320440	I think that video games aren't just a cog in a very complex contraption, and to somehow try to control it would have very little effect whatsoever.
320440	326920	And then on top of that, my question to the Kentucky governor, even if this was all completely true, how do you control it?
326920	333240	Someone's house is their private sphere, you can't go around looking through people's windows and working out what games their children are playing.
333240	337560	You can promote a certain attitude, but that has been eroded away for a long time.
337560	341800	Not through video games alone, it can be witnessed everywhere in society.
341800	344280	Unfortunately, it is the century we live in.
344280	350840	For most school shooters, for most terrorists, for most individuals who cause exceptional grief within societies,
350840	358920	it's a very long chain of events that predated the existence of video games within their lives, and that's something that Matt Bevin needs to grasp.
358920	364280	I believe some people have biological ability to cause excessive pain, whereas others don't.
364280	370120	But for those who do, it's a long chain of prerequisites from there that are needed to activate such an insanity.
370120	373560	For Cruz, the activation likely started when he was orphaned.
373560	383320	Most psychologists agree the first two years are a critical time in a child's life, and with no real parental connection within that, what started was a long chain of events.
383320	387240	Does this mean we shouldn't discuss certain situational factors that we can change?
387240	393080	No, we can definitely start a discussion in how to prevent someone like him from ever ending up in that situation,
393080	402280	but to focus on the trivial matters like video games is focusing on something so sketchy that it almost seems like Mr Bevin wanted to change the discussion from what should be spoken about.
402280	411240	And regardless of what you think, it's a chat worth having, and these distraction techniques are just going to hold up that important discourse, but it will never prevent it.
411240	414760	It's pointless stalling, it's a risky game he's playing.
414760	420600	I've covered this before, but America is in a unique situation that needs new, unique discussions to be held.
420600	427160	Video games are not unique, and I don't think the circumstance even within that context makes them unique either.
427160	430120	It's time to drop the bullshit and get to the point.
430120	435640	Anyway, I would love to hear your thoughts on this, what do you think America's biggest problem that it needs to navigate?
435640	438600	As long as it's not video games, then I would love to hear down below.
438600	442760	Until then, however, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
444760	456520	Thanks for watching guys!
