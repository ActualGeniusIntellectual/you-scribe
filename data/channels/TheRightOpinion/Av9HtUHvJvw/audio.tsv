0	9700	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
9700	11320	too much free time.
11320	13240	And will this be the end of my career?
13240	14240	Maybe so.
14240	18060	In my time, I have spoken about many controversial topics, stuff that has hit close to home for
18060	22200	many individuals, but today I delve into new territories, and even as someone who likes
22200	25680	to remain impartial, there is no middle ground on this subject.
25680	27460	There is no room for compromise.
27460	31700	This topic is something where even the utterance of such lexicon boils the hemoglobin within
31700	37340	my arteries, where it ignites this rage that may exist within this frosty skeleton of mine.
37340	41780	Even as I gradually fade into the abyss, this is something which I cannot stand by and allow
41780	44500	to continue transpiring in front of my eyes.
44500	49380	I have to make a stand, even if it kills me, even if it drains the colour from my epidermis,
49380	53860	even if the cult that backs this monstrosity turns up to my house and tortures me alive,
53860	58100	I will die on this hill, and will be a martyr for the course.
58100	64820	So, let's talk about the abomination, the atrocity, the obscenity, that is pineapple
64820	65820	on pizza.
65820	66820	WHAT?
66820	72880	Once upon a time, the world was at peace, always serene, and there was a pleasant placidness
72880	75140	that prevailed over the planet.
75140	76140	Then he came.
76140	80220	That person who I will strain to name, not because it is difficult to pronounce, but
80220	84740	because even the expression of such a character damages my vocal chords from mere association
84740	85740	alone.
85740	91220	That person, that mongrel, that repellent, repulsively ghastly goon is Sam Panopoulos.
91220	93940	Panopoulos was, like most people, born.
93940	98020	But on top of that, he was born in Greece, and now you wonder why your economy's crashing.
98020	102760	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it's not fair to tarnish a population with the brush of one
102760	106780	evil mastermind, but let's say we blast Greece off the face of the earth, like someone
106780	108780	probably suggested in the last two million years.
108780	111700	I mean, there's been enough time, someone must have said it, and this catastrophe could
111700	114420	have been averted if they'd fucking followed through on it.
114420	116680	Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself.
116680	122840	This person went on a voyage to Canada, and ended up in Ontario, god rest that place.
122840	127180	And after working in the mines, he moved into the pizza business.
127180	133340	And with every plan to destroy it, he came up with this, the thing.
133340	137960	Frankenstein's monster of a creation, known as pineapple on pizza.
137960	142400	Now because the people in Ontario had their taste buds frozen due to the minus a hundred
142400	145600	temperatures regularly measured there, they became under the delusional impression that
145600	149840	somehow pineapple on pizza worked, and just because it was new, it was good.
149840	154360	Panopoulos, not satisfied with bastardizing only Italian, Greek, and Canadian culture
154360	159120	all in one, decided to brand it as Hawaiian pizza, forever destroying the helpless island
159120	161620	nation's formerly coveted cultural image.
161620	167480	He continued his reign of terror into decades come, and like a bad case of ecosystemic gangrene,
167480	171480	his brain orphaned spread throughout the various corners of the world, demolishing
171480	175920	the rational fabric of society inevitably causing the chaos that we see today.
175920	181480	Only a profoundly pernicious provocateur would permit such societal spoliation.
181480	183180	And yet he did it.
183180	184940	And people like it?
184940	190240	It is a truly sickening scenario that we live in this world today with the omnipresent threat
190240	192440	of pineapple on pizza.
192440	197400	And so you may say, well Mr. Wrong Opinion, what evidence do you have to back up such
197400	199560	audacious proclamations?
199560	205240	This is where I bring in science to destroy all your pseudo-bullshit, and I'm gonna hand
205240	209760	it over to my guest speaker, my great friend, because I am a man of science, I have a lot
209760	215560	of sciences friends, I know everything about science, Professor Dr. Marcus Trussus Virtuus
215560	221160	Turkus Smith, who has a PhD in cookingology, and he'll be presenting to you some hard facts
221160	222160	today.
222160	224860	I want you to listen carefully as he lays it out.
224860	226740	You take it away.
227140	230940	Pineapple on pizza, a rather controversial topic indeed, and one which has been debated
230940	234460	quite a bit as of recent, with numerous articles debating the topic.
234460	239060	But I, Turkey Tom, who have just gone through puberty, am here to put an end to this conversation
239060	243900	and set pineapple on pizza in the ground for the final time, using science to prove that
243900	248900	pineapple on pizza is a disgusting food from an almost objective standpoint, and simultaneously
248900	253340	show that anyone who willingly indulges in eating pineapple on pizza is a disgusting
253340	256500	troglodyte who should burn in the fires of hell.
256500	260620	Okay, obviously I am not Turkey Tom, but would you have really watched this long if I told
260620	261940	you my name was Ryan Brown?
261940	266060	Let's just get to our first piece of evidence today, which is the flavor spectrum.
266060	270740	You see, a spectrum, a little circular wheelie deal, similar to a color wheel, for those
270740	275860	of you who don't know, a wheel or spectrum is used to determine which colors mix.
275860	280500	Henceforth, such a wheel like this exhibits which flavors mix into a tasty snack.
280500	284700	For example, sweet goes with salty, sour goes with sweet, and next, and a slightly
284700	289420	overweight man go together to form the beautiful bulging brute that is Tommy C.
289420	292940	However, when looking at said wheel, what do we have here?
292940	297540	Citrus, the category of acidic fruits, which most likely relates to plants such as the
297540	302340	pineapple, and funnily enough, this flavor does not mix with dairy products in any way.
302340	303780	Shocking, I know.
303780	307820	Who would think that a pineapple wouldn't mix well with cheese, dough, and tomato sauce?
307820	312180	Well, turns out that Chef extraordinaire Gordon Ramsay actually has something to say
312180	313180	about this matter.
313180	317860	Um, let's have, um, 10 of the pepperonis?
317860	318860	How many pepperonis, Chef?
318860	321780	Put fucking pineapple on pizza.
321780	323180	And what's this?
323180	327340	The world's most famous chef proving that once and for all, pineapple on pizza is a
327340	331220	disgusting, otherworldly meal that should never ever ever be eaten ever.
331220	334320	Look, I'm not sure what else you people want from me, okay?
334320	335780	The color wheel says it all.
335780	336780	I say it.
336820	337820	Gordon says it.
337820	338820	Gordon Mcfucking Ramsay says it.
338820	341100	So what do you guys friggin' want from me?
341100	344700	This problem is imperative to the safeguarding of issues within our nation.
344700	349740	To prove this further, the objectively best nation in the world, Iceland, has a chad president
349740	351820	who thinks that pineapple should be banned from pizza.
351820	356780	While the stinking, virgin Justin Trudeau is a massive fan, this is definitive proof
356780	361340	that if you like pineapple pizza, if you're not a raging, social justice-obsessed soy
361340	365020	boy, then you're practically propping up the totalitarian regime.
365260	370260	That'll be the downfall of the modern society that we love and cherish, unless we move swiftly.
370260	374700	They're almost definitely putting soya into the pineapple, turning our children gay.
374700	376380	This is the real pizza gate.
376380	379900	Unfortunately, pineapple on pizza could be part of a brainwashing program, so I sent
379900	381980	one of our field agents to find out more.
381980	386220	Hello, and welcome to our unbiased review of pineapple pizza.
386220	389700	Now we've run into a bit of an issue, as here in Portugal, no one in their right mind would
389700	391660	serve pineapple on a pizza.
391660	395020	So what we've got here is we've got a ham pizza, and we've got some pineapple.
395020	399020	But first of all, we are going to preheat the oven.
399020	401020	Because we're not arseholes.
403020	404020	Boom.
404020	405020	Bap.
405020	406020	Bada bing.
406020	410020	Okay, so let's open these bad babies up.
415020	416020	And the pineapple.
416020	417020	I've got to be more...
417020	418020	I've got to be more...
418020	420020	I've got to be more careful with the pineapple.
420380	424380	Oh my god, how much liquid do you need?
424380	427380	Isn't pineapple on pizza meant to be dry?
427380	429380	What's it look like?
431380	432380	Oh, I smell so strong.
432380	433380	What the fuck?
435380	438380	We're just going to go ahead and pour all of this away.
438380	443380	We might lose a bit of pineapple as well, but we do not want that on our pizza.
443380	447380	For everyone at home, here's just a quick way how to ruin your pizza.
447740	449740	Isn't pineapple on pizza meant to be dry?
449740	450740	I smell so strong.
454740	455740	There you go.
455740	459740	I'm actually only going to be putting pineapple on half my pizza, because I don't want to
459740	460740	ruin it.
460740	464740	It cost me two euros, and I do not have two euros to waste.
464740	468740	This honestly goes against every single one of my instincts.
468740	473740	You realise you are having a slice of this too, by the way.
474100	478100	Okay, now we're going to go ahead and open up the oven and put the pizza in.
481100	485100	And we're just going to put the pizza in.
488100	489100	That's not...
489100	491100	Why is it sizzling?
491100	493100	Put that in.
493100	495100	And there you go.
496100	498100	And now we wait.
504100	512100	Okay, so it's been around seven minutes, we're going to go ahead and take a look at how this
512100	514100	pizza is coming along.
514100	519100	Oh god, it smells, it smells, it smells so good.
519100	524100	We're going to go ahead, I'm just going to get it out, get a bit closer while I pull
524100	525100	it out.
525100	527100	That's what she said.
527100	533100	Oh, see the thing is right, that looks like a nice pizza, but...
533460	536460	What is that?
536460	541460	Now most importantly, we're just going to make sure we salvage half of this pizza because
541460	543460	it does look like a really nice pizza.
543460	547460	I'm worried that pineapple juice will be all over it, but we're saving this for a rainy
547460	548460	day.
548460	550460	Oh no.
553460	556460	I'm really not looking forward to this.
556460	560460	I guess, let's just cut into it.
563460	568460	I didn't realise I actually had to eat it.
568460	573460	Okay, give me a second, we're going to wait for it to cool down anyway.
576460	580460	Alright, here we go, let's review it.
590460	592460	It's not good.
592820	596820	There's a nice little bit on the end where there's a pineapple bit of ham, I want you
596820	598820	to try that.
606820	614820	I've been told to try it again because apparently I spat it out too quickly, but I guess here
614820	615820	we go.
616180	626180	It's really not for me, you are wrong, no, you are wrong, you are just wrong to me.
626180	629180	I cannot eat it, I cannot eat what I...
636180	645180	Just as some proof that I actually do enjoy pizza, that's fine, so you can fuck off, you're
645540	649540	a disappointment, you can take a fucking vacation, fuck off.
649540	653540	So yeah, in conclusion, don't try this at home kids, unless you want to vomit in your
653540	660540	own mouth, just have a regular pizza, and that is my unbiased review of pineapple pizza.
662540	667540	It's clearly a disgusting food which none should ever eat, ever, and after interviewing
667540	672040	a few people in the DMs and developing proof of their crimes against humanity, I can now
672400	676400	present evidence to you that your favorite YouTubers have been lying to you.
676400	681400	The people who you have looked up to over the past weeks, months, and perhaps even years
681400	687400	have actually been lying to you this entire time and are on the wrong side of this argument.
687400	689400	Dare I say, the evil side.
689400	694400	So join me as I take you on a journey of liars and pineapple pizza sympathizers.
694400	697400	I hate everything, Alexium, you really let me down man.
697760	700760	The colossal is crazy the old fart actually likes the shit.
700760	705760	Tommy C, still a perfect human being, but nevertheless, this is quite a let down.
705760	709760	Wow, honestly I wasn't sure how to react to these DMs at first.
709760	711760	Don't worry, I have a solution.
711760	714760	Unsubscribe from all of the creators.
714760	719760	Unpledge from their Patreons and never ever press that bell button to receive notifications
719760	720760	every time they upload.
720760	724760	I'm Ryan and I've been fighting the good fight against pineapple pizza for you.
724760	725760	Goodbye.
726120	730120	My friends, that is the unseen side of pineapple pizza.
730120	732120	The fruity elites do not want you to know.
732120	736120	But here on the right opinion we always go one step further to unveil the truth
736120	740120	and you can thank my committed brilliant team of researchers with their ever reliable sources
740120	744120	to reveal the true horrors of placing pineapple on pizza.
744120	746120	I just send a chill dumb own spy.
746120	749120	So, I hear your wretched voices screeching,
749120	753120	the wrong opinion, so we may destroy society as we know it,
753480	758480	who cares, we're not hurting anyone individually, it's all relative, we're just reforming.
758480	763480	You think your actions have no implications and maybe I, the open minded opinion
763480	765480	would give you the benefit of the doubt.
765480	770480	But then I met this man and his story truly harried me to take a stand
770480	775480	and if you're not taking a stand after this then you're a hedonistic coward
775480	778480	who doesn't consider the value of human life.
778480	779480	Play the clip.
779840	783840	I've only recently turned 18 years old, my early adult years,
783840	786840	yet my hair is falling out, I can't saw my face to anyone,
786840	788840	not since the day everything changed.
788840	793840	You see I used to be quite a fan of the delicacy pizza, as some may call it.
793840	796840	I used to love going into our nearby pizza shop
796840	799840	and ordering scrumptious straight out of the oven pizza.
799840	802840	But one day I walked in, I took a sniff of the air around me,
802840	805840	it was different, something was wrong.
805840	807840	I didn't really think much about it however,
808200	811200	I proceeded towards the counter where a smiling face met me.
811200	816200	I asked for the regular, meat lover's pizza with the entire spectrum of meats available on it.
816200	820200	Sausage, bacon, pepperoni and even ham.
820200	823200	However, they had none left, it was heartbreaking.
823200	827200	The man working at the counter seemed distraught from the look of hopelessness in my eyes.
827200	830200	That's when he told me the phrase that would change my life.
830200	834200	I'll tell you what, we have a deal for Hawaiian pizza at 50% off
834200	837200	but since you're a regular, I'll let you have it on the house.
837560	840560	Hawaiian pizza, I asked, my voice trembling.
840560	845560	I've never heard such a thing, but I wouldn't just toss up an opportunity for free pizza, would I?
845560	848560	Well, it was in that moment my life would change forever.
848560	852560	I arrived home at my modest home with a warm steaming box of pizza,
852560	854560	but something felt off.
854560	857560	There was a tang in the air, a tang which didn't feel right.
857560	861560	I opened up the box, and as when I noticed something was off,
861560	864560	the ham covering the pizza looked truly beautiful.
864920	866920	Alongside it was... that thing.
866920	869920	Pineapple lay upon the bed of cheese.
869920	873920	I believe this seemed odd, but I thought, no use throwing out a free pizza, right?
873920	876920	Heh, what a fool I was.
876920	879920	Before I knew it, I was taking my first bite into it. I trembled.
879920	881920	Something just didn't feel right about this.
881920	883920	It was wrong.
883920	885920	I spat it out and rushed to the nearest phone,
885920	888920	but before I could call an ambulance, that was how cold.
888920	891920	Turns out that pineapple on pizza is incredibly disgusting.
892280	895280	So disgusting, in fact, that it almost killed me.
895280	898280	My throat nearly closed over just because of it.
898280	901280	To this day, I have to hide my face due to the incredible damage
901280	903280	the swallowing has caused to my face.
903280	906280	Hey, pineapple on pizza isn't that bad.
906280	908280	You're just allergic to pineapple.
914280	916280	That was truly riveting.
916280	918280	And that's why I do this.
918280	920280	It's for moments like these on the right opinion.
920640	923640	It's not disgusting, but exposing the inhumanities of matters like this.
923640	926640	Pineapple on pizza was invented in a time when we needed stability,
926640	930640	and yet it has thrown everything we hold dear down the gutter.
930640	935640	It is symbolic and causally representative of self-loathing within our own circles,
935640	943640	and yet we continue to go round and round and round and round and round and round and round.
945640	947640	It's time to break the cycle.
948000	951000	It's time to take a stand and say I will not tolerate this.
951000	955000	I will not watch as these blacksmith traitors slowly tear down everything
955000	959000	that our forefathers have spent centuries and millennia to build up.
959000	962000	We risk total anarchy thanks to pineapple on pizza.
962000	968000	The question is, will you let your sick desires take us down the slippery slope to oblivion?
968000	969000	I would not.
969000	973000	Even if I craved pineapple on pizza, I would cut off my own limbs
973000	976000	before allowing my own selfish pleasures to dismantle the mores
976360	978360	that we have constructed so carefully.
978360	983360	I would not let it be obliterated by an excuse of a culinary dish.
983360	988360	Would you, punk, would you do what is right?
988360	992360	I want you to make sure that you follow those people and you tell them.
992360	995360	I want you to go and check out everyone who has came on to my channel today
995360	999360	to expose this truth and tell them now I know the truth of pineapple on pizza
999360	1003360	and we can take a stand, tell them that, and they will feel reinforced
1003360	1005360	to tell their stories again and again and again.
1005720	1007720	Go and check them out.
1007720	1010720	As for me, this might be the end.
1010720	1014720	This might be the end of the right opinion as we know it.
1014720	1019720	But remember, when you come to my grave, when you lay a wreath in my memoriam,
1019720	1023720	I went down in a blaze of glory fighting for what was right.
1023720	1028720	The eyes of history will honor my name as a crusader for the cause.
1028720	1033720	Brothers, sisters, non-binaries,
1034080	1038080	it is time to remember why we are here.
1038080	1043080	A king, a country, a culture.
1043080	1048080	Sometimes we have to take a stand to survive.
1050080	1053080	I'm the right opinion and goodbye.
1063720	1065720	Thank you for watching!
