00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,700
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,320
too much free time.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,240
And will this be the end of my career?

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,240
Maybe so.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,060
In my time, I have spoken about many controversial topics, stuff that has hit close to home for

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,200
many individuals, but today I delve into new territories, and even as someone who likes

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,680
to remain impartial, there is no middle ground on this subject.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,460
There is no room for compromise.

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,700
This topic is something where even the utterance of such lexicon boils the hemoglobin within

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:37,340
my arteries, where it ignites this rage that may exist within this frosty skeleton of mine.

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,780
Even as I gradually fade into the abyss, this is something which I cannot stand by and allow

12
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,500
to continue transpiring in front of my eyes.

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,380
I have to make a stand, even if it kills me, even if it drains the colour from my epidermis,

14
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,860
even if the cult that backs this monstrosity turns up to my house and tortures me alive,

15
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,100
I will die on this hill, and will be a martyr for the course.

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:04,820
So, let's talk about the abomination, the atrocity, the obscenity, that is pineapple

17
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:05,820
on pizza.

18
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,820
WHAT?

19
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:12,880
Once upon a time, the world was at peace, always serene, and there was a pleasant placidness

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,140
that prevailed over the planet.

21
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,140
Then he came.

22
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,220
That person who I will strain to name, not because it is difficult to pronounce, but

23
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,740
because even the expression of such a character damages my vocal chords from mere association

24
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,740
alone.

25
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,220
That person, that mongrel, that repellent, repulsively ghastly goon is Sam Panopoulos.

26
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,940
Panopoulos was, like most people, born.

27
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:38,020
But on top of that, he was born in Greece, and now you wonder why your economy's crashing.

28
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,760
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it's not fair to tarnish a population with the brush of one

29
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,780
evil mastermind, but let's say we blast Greece off the face of the earth, like someone

30
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,780
probably suggested in the last two million years.

31
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,700
I mean, there's been enough time, someone must have said it, and this catastrophe could

32
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,420
have been averted if they'd fucking followed through on it.

33
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,680
Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself.

34
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:02,840
This person went on a voyage to Canada, and ended up in Ontario, god rest that place.

35
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,180
And after working in the mines, he moved into the pizza business.

36
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:13,340
And with every plan to destroy it, he came up with this, the thing.

37
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,960
Frankenstein's monster of a creation, known as pineapple on pizza.

38
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,400
Now because the people in Ontario had their taste buds frozen due to the minus a hundred

39
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,600
temperatures regularly measured there, they became under the delusional impression that

40
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,840
somehow pineapple on pizza worked, and just because it was new, it was good.

41
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,360
Panopoulos, not satisfied with bastardizing only Italian, Greek, and Canadian culture

42
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,120
all in one, decided to brand it as Hawaiian pizza, forever destroying the helpless island

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,620
nation's formerly coveted cultural image.

44
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:47,480
He continued his reign of terror into decades come, and like a bad case of ecosystemic gangrene,

45
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,480
his brain orphaned spread throughout the various corners of the world, demolishing

46
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,920
the rational fabric of society inevitably causing the chaos that we see today.

47
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,480
Only a profoundly pernicious provocateur would permit such societal spoliation.

48
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,180
And yet he did it.

49
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,940
And people like it?

50
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:10,240
It is a truly sickening scenario that we live in this world today with the omnipresent threat

51
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,440
of pineapple on pizza.

52
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,400
And so you may say, well Mr. Wrong Opinion, what evidence do you have to back up such

53
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,560
audacious proclamations?

54
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,240
This is where I bring in science to destroy all your pseudo-bullshit, and I'm gonna hand

55
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,760
it over to my guest speaker, my great friend, because I am a man of science, I have a lot

56
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,560
of sciences friends, I know everything about science, Professor Dr. Marcus Trussus Virtuus

57
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,160
Turkus Smith, who has a PhD in cookingology, and he'll be presenting to you some hard facts

58
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,160
today.

59
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,860
I want you to listen carefully as he lays it out.

60
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,740
You take it away.

61
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,940
Pineapple on pizza, a rather controversial topic indeed, and one which has been debated

62
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,460
quite a bit as of recent, with numerous articles debating the topic.

63
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:59,060
But I, Turkey Tom, who have just gone through puberty, am here to put an end to this conversation

64
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,900
and set pineapple on pizza in the ground for the final time, using science to prove that

65
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,900
pineapple on pizza is a disgusting food from an almost objective standpoint, and simultaneously

66
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,340
show that anyone who willingly indulges in eating pineapple on pizza is a disgusting

67
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,500
troglodyte who should burn in the fires of hell.

68
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,620
Okay, obviously I am not Turkey Tom, but would you have really watched this long if I told

69
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,940
you my name was Ryan Brown?

70
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,060
Let's just get to our first piece of evidence today, which is the flavor spectrum.

71
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,740
You see, a spectrum, a little circular wheelie deal, similar to a color wheel, for those

72
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,860
of you who don't know, a wheel or spectrum is used to determine which colors mix.

73
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,500
Henceforth, such a wheel like this exhibits which flavors mix into a tasty snack.

74
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,700
For example, sweet goes with salty, sour goes with sweet, and next, and a slightly

75
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,420
overweight man go together to form the beautiful bulging brute that is Tommy C.

76
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,940
However, when looking at said wheel, what do we have here?

77
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,540
Citrus, the category of acidic fruits, which most likely relates to plants such as the

78
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,340
pineapple, and funnily enough, this flavor does not mix with dairy products in any way.

79
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,780
Shocking, I know.

80
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,820
Who would think that a pineapple wouldn't mix well with cheese, dough, and tomato sauce?

81
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,180
Well, turns out that Chef extraordinaire Gordon Ramsay actually has something to say

82
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,180
about this matter.

83
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,860
Um, let's have, um, 10 of the pepperonis?

84
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,860
How many pepperonis, Chef?

85
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,780
Put fucking pineapple on pizza.

86
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,180
And what's this?

87
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,340
The world's most famous chef proving that once and for all, pineapple on pizza is a

88
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,220
disgusting, otherworldly meal that should never ever ever be eaten ever.

89
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,320
Look, I'm not sure what else you people want from me, okay?

90
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,780
The color wheel says it all.

91
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,780
I say it.

92
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,820
Gordon says it.

93
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,820
Gordon Mcfucking Ramsay says it.

94
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,100
So what do you guys friggin' want from me?

95
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,700
This problem is imperative to the safeguarding of issues within our nation.

96
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,740
To prove this further, the objectively best nation in the world, Iceland, has a chad president

97
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,820
who thinks that pineapple should be banned from pizza.

98
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,780
While the stinking, virgin Justin Trudeau is a massive fan, this is definitive proof

99
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:01,340
that if you like pineapple pizza, if you're not a raging, social justice-obsessed soy

100
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,020
boy, then you're practically propping up the totalitarian regime.

101
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:10,260
That'll be the downfall of the modern society that we love and cherish, unless we move swiftly.

102
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,700
They're almost definitely putting soya into the pineapple, turning our children gay.

103
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,380
This is the real pizza gate.

104
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,900
Unfortunately, pineapple on pizza could be part of a brainwashing program, so I sent

105
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,980
one of our field agents to find out more.

106
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,220
Hello, and welcome to our unbiased review of pineapple pizza.

107
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,700
Now we've run into a bit of an issue, as here in Portugal, no one in their right mind would

108
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,660
serve pineapple on a pizza.

109
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,020
So what we've got here is we've got a ham pizza, and we've got some pineapple.

110
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,020
But first of all, we are going to preheat the oven.

111
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,020
Because we're not arseholes.

112
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,020
Boom.

113
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,020
Bap.

114
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,020
Bada bing.

115
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,020
Okay, so let's open these bad babies up.

116
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,020
And the pineapple.

117
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,020
I've got to be more...

118
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,020
I've got to be more...

119
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,020
I've got to be more careful with the pineapple.

120
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:04,380
Oh my god, how much liquid do you need?

121
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,380
Isn't pineapple on pizza meant to be dry?

122
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,380
What's it look like?

123
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,380
Oh, I smell so strong.

124
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,380
What the fuck?

125
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,380
We're just going to go ahead and pour all of this away.

126
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,380
We might lose a bit of pineapple as well, but we do not want that on our pizza.

127
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,380
For everyone at home, here's just a quick way how to ruin your pizza.

128
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,740
Isn't pineapple on pizza meant to be dry?

129
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,740
I smell so strong.

130
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,740
There you go.

131
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,740
I'm actually only going to be putting pineapple on half my pizza, because I don't want to

132
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,740
ruin it.

133
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,740
It cost me two euros, and I do not have two euros to waste.

134
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,740
This honestly goes against every single one of my instincts.

135
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:53,740
You realise you are having a slice of this too, by the way.

136
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,100
Okay, now we're going to go ahead and open up the oven and put the pizza in.

137
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,100
And we're just going to put the pizza in.

138
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,100
That's not...

139
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,100
Why is it sizzling?

140
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,100
Put that in.

141
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,100
And there you go.

142
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,100
And now we wait.

143
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:32,100
Okay, so it's been around seven minutes, we're going to go ahead and take a look at how this

144
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,100
pizza is coming along.

145
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:39,100
Oh god, it smells, it smells, it smells so good.

146
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:44,100
We're going to go ahead, I'm just going to get it out, get a bit closer while I pull

147
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,100
it out.

148
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,100
That's what she said.

149
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:53,100
Oh, see the thing is right, that looks like a nice pizza, but...

150
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,460
What is that?

151
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,460
Now most importantly, we're just going to make sure we salvage half of this pizza because

152
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,460
it does look like a really nice pizza.

153
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,460
I'm worried that pineapple juice will be all over it, but we're saving this for a rainy

154
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,460
day.

155
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,460
Oh no.

156
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,460
I'm really not looking forward to this.

157
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,460
I guess, let's just cut into it.

158
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:28,460
I didn't realise I actually had to eat it.

159
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:33,460
Okay, give me a second, we're going to wait for it to cool down anyway.

160
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,460
Alright, here we go, let's review it.

161
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,460
It's not good.

162
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,820
There's a nice little bit on the end where there's a pineapple bit of ham, I want you

163
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,820
to try that.

164
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:14,820
I've been told to try it again because apparently I spat it out too quickly, but I guess here

165
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,820
we go.

166
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:26,180
It's really not for me, you are wrong, no, you are wrong, you are just wrong to me.

167
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,180
I cannot eat it, I cannot eat what I...

168
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:45,180
Just as some proof that I actually do enjoy pizza, that's fine, so you can fuck off, you're

169
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,540
a disappointment, you can take a fucking vacation, fuck off.

170
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,540
So yeah, in conclusion, don't try this at home kids, unless you want to vomit in your

171
00:10:53,540 --> 00:11:00,540
own mouth, just have a regular pizza, and that is my unbiased review of pineapple pizza.

172
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:07,540
It's clearly a disgusting food which none should ever eat, ever, and after interviewing

173
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,040
a few people in the DMs and developing proof of their crimes against humanity, I can now

174
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,400
present evidence to you that your favorite YouTubers have been lying to you.

175
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,400
The people who you have looked up to over the past weeks, months, and perhaps even years

176
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:27,400
have actually been lying to you this entire time and are on the wrong side of this argument.

177
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,400
Dare I say, the evil side.

178
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,400
So join me as I take you on a journey of liars and pineapple pizza sympathizers.

179
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,400
I hate everything, Alexium, you really let me down man.

180
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,760
The colossal is crazy the old fart actually likes the shit.

181
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,760
Tommy C, still a perfect human being, but nevertheless, this is quite a let down.

182
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,760
Wow, honestly I wasn't sure how to react to these DMs at first.

183
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,760
Don't worry, I have a solution.

184
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,760
Unsubscribe from all of the creators.

185
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,760
Unpledge from their Patreons and never ever press that bell button to receive notifications

186
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,760
every time they upload.

187
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,760
I'm Ryan and I've been fighting the good fight against pineapple pizza for you.

188
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,760
Goodbye.

189
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,120
My friends, that is the unseen side of pineapple pizza.

190
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,120
The fruity elites do not want you to know.

191
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,120
But here on the right opinion we always go one step further to unveil the truth

192
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,120
and you can thank my committed brilliant team of researchers with their ever reliable sources

193
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,120
to reveal the true horrors of placing pineapple on pizza.

194
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,120
I just send a chill dumb own spy.

195
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,120
So, I hear your wretched voices screeching,

196
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,120
the wrong opinion, so we may destroy society as we know it,

197
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,480
who cares, we're not hurting anyone individually, it's all relative, we're just reforming.

198
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,480
You think your actions have no implications and maybe I, the open minded opinion

199
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,480
would give you the benefit of the doubt.

200
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,480
But then I met this man and his story truly harried me to take a stand

201
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,480
and if you're not taking a stand after this then you're a hedonistic coward

202
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,480
who doesn't consider the value of human life.

203
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,480
Play the clip.

204
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,840
I've only recently turned 18 years old, my early adult years,

205
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,840
yet my hair is falling out, I can't saw my face to anyone,

206
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,840
not since the day everything changed.

207
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,840
You see I used to be quite a fan of the delicacy pizza, as some may call it.

208
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,840
I used to love going into our nearby pizza shop

209
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,840
and ordering scrumptious straight out of the oven pizza.

210
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,840
But one day I walked in, I took a sniff of the air around me,

211
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,840
it was different, something was wrong.

212
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,840
I didn't really think much about it however,

213
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,200
I proceeded towards the counter where a smiling face met me.

214
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,200
I asked for the regular, meat lover's pizza with the entire spectrum of meats available on it.

215
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Sausage, bacon, pepperoni and even ham.

216
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,200
However, they had none left, it was heartbreaking.

217
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,200
The man working at the counter seemed distraught from the look of hopelessness in my eyes.

218
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,200
That's when he told me the phrase that would change my life.

219
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,200
I'll tell you what, we have a deal for Hawaiian pizza at 50% off

220
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,200
but since you're a regular, I'll let you have it on the house.

221
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,560
Hawaiian pizza, I asked, my voice trembling.

222
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,560
I've never heard such a thing, but I wouldn't just toss up an opportunity for free pizza, would I?

223
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,560
Well, it was in that moment my life would change forever.

224
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,560
I arrived home at my modest home with a warm steaming box of pizza,

225
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,560
but something felt off.

226
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,560
There was a tang in the air, a tang which didn't feel right.

227
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,560
I opened up the box, and as when I noticed something was off,

228
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,560
the ham covering the pizza looked truly beautiful.

229
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,920
Alongside it was... that thing.

230
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,920
Pineapple lay upon the bed of cheese.

231
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,920
I believe this seemed odd, but I thought, no use throwing out a free pizza, right?

232
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,920
Heh, what a fool I was.

233
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,920
Before I knew it, I was taking my first bite into it. I trembled.

234
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,920
Something just didn't feel right about this.

235
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,920
It was wrong.

236
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
I spat it out and rushed to the nearest phone,

237
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,920
but before I could call an ambulance, that was how cold.

238
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,920
Turns out that pineapple on pizza is incredibly disgusting.

239
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,280
So disgusting, in fact, that it almost killed me.

240
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,280
My throat nearly closed over just because of it.

241
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,280
To this day, I have to hide my face due to the incredible damage

242
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,280
the swallowing has caused to my face.

243
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,280
Hey, pineapple on pizza isn't that bad.

244
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,280
You're just allergic to pineapple.

245
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,280
That was truly riveting.

246
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,280
And that's why I do this.

247
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,280
It's for moments like these on the right opinion.

248
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,640
It's not disgusting, but exposing the inhumanities of matters like this.

249
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,640
Pineapple on pizza was invented in a time when we needed stability,

250
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,640
and yet it has thrown everything we hold dear down the gutter.

251
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,640
It is symbolic and causally representative of self-loathing within our own circles,

252
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:43,640
and yet we continue to go round and round and round and round and round and round and round.

253
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,640
It's time to break the cycle.

254
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's time to take a stand and say I will not tolerate this.

255
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I will not watch as these blacksmith traitors slowly tear down everything

256
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
that our forefathers have spent centuries and millennia to build up.

257
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
We risk total anarchy thanks to pineapple on pizza.

258
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
The question is, will you let your sick desires take us down the slippery slope to oblivion?

259
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I would not.

260
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Even if I craved pineapple on pizza, I would cut off my own limbs

261
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
before allowing my own selfish pleasures to dismantle the mores

262
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,360
that we have constructed so carefully.

263
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,360
I would not let it be obliterated by an excuse of a culinary dish.

264
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,360
Would you, punk, would you do what is right?

265
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,360
I want you to make sure that you follow those people and you tell them.

266
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,360
I want you to go and check out everyone who has came on to my channel today

267
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,360
to expose this truth and tell them now I know the truth of pineapple on pizza

268
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,360
and we can take a stand, tell them that, and they will feel reinforced

269
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,360
to tell their stories again and again and again.

270
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,720
Go and check them out.

271
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,720
As for me, this might be the end.

272
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,720
This might be the end of the right opinion as we know it.

273
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,720
But remember, when you come to my grave, when you lay a wreath in my memoriam,

274
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,720
I went down in a blaze of glory fighting for what was right.

275
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,720
The eyes of history will honor my name as a crusader for the cause.

276
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,720
Brothers, sisters, non-binaries,

277
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,080
it is time to remember why we are here.

278
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:23,080
A king, a country, a culture.

279
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:28,080
Sometimes we have to take a stand to survive.

280
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,080
I'm the right opinion and goodbye.

281
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,720
Thank you for watching!
