00:00.000 --> 00:09.700
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:09.700 --> 00:11.320
too much free time.

00:11.320 --> 00:13.240
And will this be the end of my career?

00:13.240 --> 00:14.240
Maybe so.

00:14.240 --> 00:18.060
In my time, I have spoken about many controversial topics, stuff that has hit close to home for

00:18.060 --> 00:22.200
many individuals, but today I delve into new territories, and even as someone who likes

00:22.200 --> 00:25.680
to remain impartial, there is no middle ground on this subject.

00:25.680 --> 00:27.460
There is no room for compromise.

00:27.460 --> 00:31.700
This topic is something where even the utterance of such lexicon boils the hemoglobin within

00:31.700 --> 00:37.340
my arteries, where it ignites this rage that may exist within this frosty skeleton of mine.

00:37.340 --> 00:41.780
Even as I gradually fade into the abyss, this is something which I cannot stand by and allow

00:41.780 --> 00:44.500
to continue transpiring in front of my eyes.

00:44.500 --> 00:49.380
I have to make a stand, even if it kills me, even if it drains the colour from my epidermis,

00:49.380 --> 00:53.860
even if the cult that backs this monstrosity turns up to my house and tortures me alive,

00:53.860 --> 00:58.100
I will die on this hill, and will be a martyr for the course.

00:58.100 --> 01:04.820
So, let's talk about the abomination, the atrocity, the obscenity, that is pineapple

01:04.820 --> 01:05.820
on pizza.

01:05.820 --> 01:06.820
WHAT?

01:06.820 --> 01:12.880
Once upon a time, the world was at peace, always serene, and there was a pleasant placidness

01:12.880 --> 01:15.140
that prevailed over the planet.

01:15.140 --> 01:16.140
Then he came.

01:16.140 --> 01:20.220
That person who I will strain to name, not because it is difficult to pronounce, but

01:20.220 --> 01:24.740
because even the expression of such a character damages my vocal chords from mere association

01:24.740 --> 01:25.740
alone.

01:25.740 --> 01:31.220
That person, that mongrel, that repellent, repulsively ghastly goon is Sam Panopoulos.

01:31.220 --> 01:33.940
Panopoulos was, like most people, born.

01:33.940 --> 01:38.020
But on top of that, he was born in Greece, and now you wonder why your economy's crashing.

01:38.020 --> 01:42.760
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it's not fair to tarnish a population with the brush of one

01:42.760 --> 01:46.780
evil mastermind, but let's say we blast Greece off the face of the earth, like someone

01:46.780 --> 01:48.780
probably suggested in the last two million years.

01:48.780 --> 01:51.700
I mean, there's been enough time, someone must have said it, and this catastrophe could

01:51.700 --> 01:54.420
have been averted if they'd fucking followed through on it.

01:54.420 --> 01:56.680
Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself.

01:56.680 --> 02:02.840
This person went on a voyage to Canada, and ended up in Ontario, god rest that place.

02:02.840 --> 02:07.180
And after working in the mines, he moved into the pizza business.

02:07.180 --> 02:13.340
And with every plan to destroy it, he came up with this, the thing.

02:13.340 --> 02:17.960
Frankenstein's monster of a creation, known as pineapple on pizza.

02:17.960 --> 02:22.400
Now because the people in Ontario had their taste buds frozen due to the minus a hundred

02:22.400 --> 02:25.600
temperatures regularly measured there, they became under the delusional impression that

02:25.600 --> 02:29.840
somehow pineapple on pizza worked, and just because it was new, it was good.

02:29.840 --> 02:34.360
Panopoulos, not satisfied with bastardizing only Italian, Greek, and Canadian culture

02:34.360 --> 02:39.120
all in one, decided to brand it as Hawaiian pizza, forever destroying the helpless island

02:39.120 --> 02:41.620
nation's formerly coveted cultural image.

02:41.620 --> 02:47.480
He continued his reign of terror into decades come, and like a bad case of ecosystemic gangrene,

02:47.480 --> 02:51.480
his brain orphaned spread throughout the various corners of the world, demolishing

02:51.480 --> 02:55.920
the rational fabric of society inevitably causing the chaos that we see today.

02:55.920 --> 03:01.480
Only a profoundly pernicious provocateur would permit such societal spoliation.

03:01.480 --> 03:03.180
And yet he did it.

03:03.180 --> 03:04.940
And people like it?

03:04.940 --> 03:10.240
It is a truly sickening scenario that we live in this world today with the omnipresent threat

03:10.240 --> 03:12.440
of pineapple on pizza.

03:12.440 --> 03:17.400
And so you may say, well Mr. Wrong Opinion, what evidence do you have to back up such

03:17.400 --> 03:19.560
audacious proclamations?

03:19.560 --> 03:25.240
This is where I bring in science to destroy all your pseudo-bullshit, and I'm gonna hand

03:25.240 --> 03:29.760
it over to my guest speaker, my great friend, because I am a man of science, I have a lot

03:29.760 --> 03:35.560
of sciences friends, I know everything about science, Professor Dr. Marcus Trussus Virtuus

03:35.560 --> 03:41.160
Turkus Smith, who has a PhD in cookingology, and he'll be presenting to you some hard facts

03:41.160 --> 03:42.160
today.

03:42.160 --> 03:44.860
I want you to listen carefully as he lays it out.

03:44.860 --> 03:46.740
You take it away.

03:47.140 --> 03:50.940
Pineapple on pizza, a rather controversial topic indeed, and one which has been debated

03:50.940 --> 03:54.460
quite a bit as of recent, with numerous articles debating the topic.

03:54.460 --> 03:59.060
But I, Turkey Tom, who have just gone through puberty, am here to put an end to this conversation

03:59.060 --> 04:03.900
and set pineapple on pizza in the ground for the final time, using science to prove that

04:03.900 --> 04:08.900
pineapple on pizza is a disgusting food from an almost objective standpoint, and simultaneously

04:08.900 --> 04:13.340
show that anyone who willingly indulges in eating pineapple on pizza is a disgusting

04:13.340 --> 04:16.500
troglodyte who should burn in the fires of hell.

04:16.500 --> 04:20.620
Okay, obviously I am not Turkey Tom, but would you have really watched this long if I told

04:20.620 --> 04:21.940
you my name was Ryan Brown?

04:21.940 --> 04:26.060
Let's just get to our first piece of evidence today, which is the flavor spectrum.

04:26.060 --> 04:30.740
You see, a spectrum, a little circular wheelie deal, similar to a color wheel, for those

04:30.740 --> 04:35.860
of you who don't know, a wheel or spectrum is used to determine which colors mix.

04:35.860 --> 04:40.500
Henceforth, such a wheel like this exhibits which flavors mix into a tasty snack.

04:40.500 --> 04:44.700
For example, sweet goes with salty, sour goes with sweet, and next, and a slightly

04:44.700 --> 04:49.420
overweight man go together to form the beautiful bulging brute that is Tommy C.

04:49.420 --> 04:52.940
However, when looking at said wheel, what do we have here?

04:52.940 --> 04:57.540
Citrus, the category of acidic fruits, which most likely relates to plants such as the

04:57.540 --> 05:02.340
pineapple, and funnily enough, this flavor does not mix with dairy products in any way.

05:02.340 --> 05:03.780
Shocking, I know.

05:03.780 --> 05:07.820
Who would think that a pineapple wouldn't mix well with cheese, dough, and tomato sauce?

05:07.820 --> 05:12.180
Well, turns out that Chef extraordinaire Gordon Ramsay actually has something to say

05:12.180 --> 05:13.180
about this matter.

05:13.180 --> 05:17.860
Um, let's have, um, 10 of the pepperonis?

05:17.860 --> 05:18.860
How many pepperonis, Chef?

05:18.860 --> 05:21.780
Put fucking pineapple on pizza.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.180
And what's this?

05:23.180 --> 05:27.340
The world's most famous chef proving that once and for all, pineapple on pizza is a

05:27.340 --> 05:31.220
disgusting, otherworldly meal that should never ever ever be eaten ever.

05:31.220 --> 05:34.320
Look, I'm not sure what else you people want from me, okay?

05:34.320 --> 05:35.780
The color wheel says it all.

05:35.780 --> 05:36.780
I say it.

05:36.820 --> 05:37.820
Gordon says it.

05:37.820 --> 05:38.820
Gordon Mcfucking Ramsay says it.

05:38.820 --> 05:41.100
So what do you guys friggin' want from me?

05:41.100 --> 05:44.700
This problem is imperative to the safeguarding of issues within our nation.

05:44.700 --> 05:49.740
To prove this further, the objectively best nation in the world, Iceland, has a chad president

05:49.740 --> 05:51.820
who thinks that pineapple should be banned from pizza.

05:51.820 --> 05:56.780
While the stinking, virgin Justin Trudeau is a massive fan, this is definitive proof

05:56.780 --> 06:01.340
that if you like pineapple pizza, if you're not a raging, social justice-obsessed soy

06:01.340 --> 06:05.020
boy, then you're practically propping up the totalitarian regime.

06:05.260 --> 06:10.260
That'll be the downfall of the modern society that we love and cherish, unless we move swiftly.

06:10.260 --> 06:14.700
They're almost definitely putting soya into the pineapple, turning our children gay.

06:14.700 --> 06:16.380
This is the real pizza gate.

06:16.380 --> 06:19.900
Unfortunately, pineapple on pizza could be part of a brainwashing program, so I sent

06:19.900 --> 06:21.980
one of our field agents to find out more.

06:21.980 --> 06:26.220
Hello, and welcome to our unbiased review of pineapple pizza.

06:26.220 --> 06:29.700
Now we've run into a bit of an issue, as here in Portugal, no one in their right mind would

06:29.700 --> 06:31.660
serve pineapple on a pizza.

06:31.660 --> 06:35.020
So what we've got here is we've got a ham pizza, and we've got some pineapple.

06:35.020 --> 06:39.020
But first of all, we are going to preheat the oven.

06:39.020 --> 06:41.020
Because we're not arseholes.

06:43.020 --> 06:44.020
Boom.

06:44.020 --> 06:45.020
Bap.

06:45.020 --> 06:46.020
Bada bing.

06:46.020 --> 06:50.020
Okay, so let's open these bad babies up.

06:55.020 --> 06:56.020
And the pineapple.

06:56.020 --> 06:57.020
I've got to be more...

06:57.020 --> 06:58.020
I've got to be more...

06:58.020 --> 07:00.020
I've got to be more careful with the pineapple.

07:00.380 --> 07:04.380
Oh my god, how much liquid do you need?

07:04.380 --> 07:07.380
Isn't pineapple on pizza meant to be dry?

07:07.380 --> 07:09.380
What's it look like?

07:11.380 --> 07:12.380
Oh, I smell so strong.

07:12.380 --> 07:13.380
What the fuck?

07:15.380 --> 07:18.380
We're just going to go ahead and pour all of this away.

07:18.380 --> 07:23.380
We might lose a bit of pineapple as well, but we do not want that on our pizza.

07:23.380 --> 07:27.380
For everyone at home, here's just a quick way how to ruin your pizza.

07:27.740 --> 07:29.740
Isn't pineapple on pizza meant to be dry?

07:29.740 --> 07:30.740
I smell so strong.

07:34.740 --> 07:35.740
There you go.

07:35.740 --> 07:39.740
I'm actually only going to be putting pineapple on half my pizza, because I don't want to

07:39.740 --> 07:40.740
ruin it.

07:40.740 --> 07:44.740
It cost me two euros, and I do not have two euros to waste.

07:44.740 --> 07:48.740
This honestly goes against every single one of my instincts.

07:48.740 --> 07:53.740
You realise you are having a slice of this too, by the way.

07:54.100 --> 07:58.100
Okay, now we're going to go ahead and open up the oven and put the pizza in.

08:01.100 --> 08:05.100
And we're just going to put the pizza in.

08:08.100 --> 08:09.100
That's not...

08:09.100 --> 08:11.100
Why is it sizzling?

08:11.100 --> 08:13.100
Put that in.

08:13.100 --> 08:15.100
And there you go.

08:16.100 --> 08:18.100
And now we wait.

08:24.100 --> 08:32.100
Okay, so it's been around seven minutes, we're going to go ahead and take a look at how this

08:32.100 --> 08:34.100
pizza is coming along.

08:34.100 --> 08:39.100
Oh god, it smells, it smells, it smells so good.

08:39.100 --> 08:44.100
We're going to go ahead, I'm just going to get it out, get a bit closer while I pull

08:44.100 --> 08:45.100
it out.

08:45.100 --> 08:47.100
That's what she said.

08:47.100 --> 08:53.100
Oh, see the thing is right, that looks like a nice pizza, but...

08:53.460 --> 08:56.460
What is that?

08:56.460 --> 09:01.460
Now most importantly, we're just going to make sure we salvage half of this pizza because

09:01.460 --> 09:03.460
it does look like a really nice pizza.

09:03.460 --> 09:07.460
I'm worried that pineapple juice will be all over it, but we're saving this for a rainy

09:07.460 --> 09:08.460
day.

09:08.460 --> 09:10.460
Oh no.

09:13.460 --> 09:16.460
I'm really not looking forward to this.

09:16.460 --> 09:20.460
I guess, let's just cut into it.

09:23.460 --> 09:28.460
I didn't realise I actually had to eat it.

09:28.460 --> 09:33.460
Okay, give me a second, we're going to wait for it to cool down anyway.

09:36.460 --> 09:40.460
Alright, here we go, let's review it.

09:50.460 --> 09:52.460
It's not good.

09:52.820 --> 09:56.820
There's a nice little bit on the end where there's a pineapple bit of ham, I want you

09:56.820 --> 09:58.820
to try that.

10:06.820 --> 10:14.820
I've been told to try it again because apparently I spat it out too quickly, but I guess here

10:14.820 --> 10:15.820
we go.

10:16.180 --> 10:26.180
It's really not for me, you are wrong, no, you are wrong, you are just wrong to me.

10:26.180 --> 10:29.180
I cannot eat it, I cannot eat what I...

10:36.180 --> 10:45.180
Just as some proof that I actually do enjoy pizza, that's fine, so you can fuck off, you're

10:45.540 --> 10:49.540
a disappointment, you can take a fucking vacation, fuck off.

10:49.540 --> 10:53.540
So yeah, in conclusion, don't try this at home kids, unless you want to vomit in your

10:53.540 --> 11:00.540
own mouth, just have a regular pizza, and that is my unbiased review of pineapple pizza.

11:02.540 --> 11:07.540
It's clearly a disgusting food which none should ever eat, ever, and after interviewing

11:07.540 --> 11:12.040
a few people in the DMs and developing proof of their crimes against humanity, I can now

11:12.400 --> 11:16.400
present evidence to you that your favorite YouTubers have been lying to you.

11:16.400 --> 11:21.400
The people who you have looked up to over the past weeks, months, and perhaps even years

11:21.400 --> 11:27.400
have actually been lying to you this entire time and are on the wrong side of this argument.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.400
Dare I say, the evil side.

11:29.400 --> 11:34.400
So join me as I take you on a journey of liars and pineapple pizza sympathizers.

11:34.400 --> 11:37.400
I hate everything, Alexium, you really let me down man.

11:37.760 --> 11:40.760
The colossal is crazy the old fart actually likes the shit.

11:40.760 --> 11:45.760
Tommy C, still a perfect human being, but nevertheless, this is quite a let down.

11:45.760 --> 11:49.760
Wow, honestly I wasn't sure how to react to these DMs at first.

11:49.760 --> 11:51.760
Don't worry, I have a solution.

11:51.760 --> 11:54.760
Unsubscribe from all of the creators.

11:54.760 --> 11:59.760
Unpledge from their Patreons and never ever press that bell button to receive notifications

11:59.760 --> 12:00.760
every time they upload.

12:00.760 --> 12:04.760
I'm Ryan and I've been fighting the good fight against pineapple pizza for you.

12:04.760 --> 12:05.760
Goodbye.

12:06.120 --> 12:10.120
My friends, that is the unseen side of pineapple pizza.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.120
The fruity elites do not want you to know.

12:12.120 --> 12:16.120
But here on the right opinion we always go one step further to unveil the truth

12:16.120 --> 12:20.120
and you can thank my committed brilliant team of researchers with their ever reliable sources

12:20.120 --> 12:24.120
to reveal the true horrors of placing pineapple on pizza.

12:24.120 --> 12:26.120
I just send a chill dumb own spy.

12:26.120 --> 12:29.120
So, I hear your wretched voices screeching,

12:29.120 --> 12:33.120
the wrong opinion, so we may destroy society as we know it,

12:33.480 --> 12:38.480
who cares, we're not hurting anyone individually, it's all relative, we're just reforming.

12:38.480 --> 12:43.480
You think your actions have no implications and maybe I, the open minded opinion

12:43.480 --> 12:45.480
would give you the benefit of the doubt.

12:45.480 --> 12:50.480
But then I met this man and his story truly harried me to take a stand

12:50.480 --> 12:55.480
and if you're not taking a stand after this then you're a hedonistic coward

12:55.480 --> 12:58.480
who doesn't consider the value of human life.

12:58.480 --> 12:59.480
Play the clip.

12:59.840 --> 13:03.840
I've only recently turned 18 years old, my early adult years,

13:03.840 --> 13:06.840
yet my hair is falling out, I can't saw my face to anyone,

13:06.840 --> 13:08.840
not since the day everything changed.

13:08.840 --> 13:13.840
You see I used to be quite a fan of the delicacy pizza, as some may call it.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.840
I used to love going into our nearby pizza shop

13:16.840 --> 13:19.840
and ordering scrumptious straight out of the oven pizza.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.840
But one day I walked in, I took a sniff of the air around me,

13:22.840 --> 13:25.840
it was different, something was wrong.

13:25.840 --> 13:27.840
I didn't really think much about it however,

13:28.200 --> 13:31.200
I proceeded towards the counter where a smiling face met me.

13:31.200 --> 13:36.200
I asked for the regular, meat lover's pizza with the entire spectrum of meats available on it.

13:36.200 --> 13:40.200
Sausage, bacon, pepperoni and even ham.

13:40.200 --> 13:43.200
However, they had none left, it was heartbreaking.

13:43.200 --> 13:47.200
The man working at the counter seemed distraught from the look of hopelessness in my eyes.

13:47.200 --> 13:50.200
That's when he told me the phrase that would change my life.

13:50.200 --> 13:54.200
I'll tell you what, we have a deal for Hawaiian pizza at 50% off

13:54.200 --> 13:57.200
but since you're a regular, I'll let you have it on the house.

13:57.560 --> 14:00.560
Hawaiian pizza, I asked, my voice trembling.

14:00.560 --> 14:05.560
I've never heard such a thing, but I wouldn't just toss up an opportunity for free pizza, would I?

14:05.560 --> 14:08.560
Well, it was in that moment my life would change forever.

14:08.560 --> 14:12.560
I arrived home at my modest home with a warm steaming box of pizza,

14:12.560 --> 14:14.560
but something felt off.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.560
There was a tang in the air, a tang which didn't feel right.

14:17.560 --> 14:21.560
I opened up the box, and as when I noticed something was off,

14:21.560 --> 14:24.560
the ham covering the pizza looked truly beautiful.

14:24.920 --> 14:26.920
Alongside it was... that thing.

14:26.920 --> 14:29.920
Pineapple lay upon the bed of cheese.

14:29.920 --> 14:33.920
I believe this seemed odd, but I thought, no use throwing out a free pizza, right?

14:33.920 --> 14:36.920
Heh, what a fool I was.

14:36.920 --> 14:39.920
Before I knew it, I was taking my first bite into it. I trembled.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.920
Something just didn't feel right about this.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.920
It was wrong.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.920
I spat it out and rushed to the nearest phone,

14:45.920 --> 14:48.920
but before I could call an ambulance, that was how cold.

14:48.920 --> 14:51.920
Turns out that pineapple on pizza is incredibly disgusting.

14:52.280 --> 14:55.280
So disgusting, in fact, that it almost killed me.

14:55.280 --> 14:58.280
My throat nearly closed over just because of it.

14:58.280 --> 15:01.280
To this day, I have to hide my face due to the incredible damage

15:01.280 --> 15:03.280
the swallowing has caused to my face.

15:03.280 --> 15:06.280
Hey, pineapple on pizza isn't that bad.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.280
You're just allergic to pineapple.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.280
That was truly riveting.

15:16.280 --> 15:18.280
And that's why I do this.

15:18.280 --> 15:20.280
It's for moments like these on the right opinion.

15:20.640 --> 15:23.640
It's not disgusting, but exposing the inhumanities of matters like this.

15:23.640 --> 15:26.640
Pineapple on pizza was invented in a time when we needed stability,

15:26.640 --> 15:30.640
and yet it has thrown everything we hold dear down the gutter.

15:30.640 --> 15:35.640
It is symbolic and causally representative of self-loathing within our own circles,

15:35.640 --> 15:43.640
and yet we continue to go round and round and round and round and round and round and round.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.640
It's time to break the cycle.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
It's time to take a stand and say I will not tolerate this.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
I will not watch as these blacksmith traitors slowly tear down everything

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
that our forefathers have spent centuries and millennia to build up.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
We risk total anarchy thanks to pineapple on pizza.

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
The question is, will you let your sick desires take us down the slippery slope to oblivion?

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
I would not.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
Even if I craved pineapple on pizza, I would cut off my own limbs

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
before allowing my own selfish pleasures to dismantle the mores

16:16.360 --> 16:18.360
that we have constructed so carefully.

16:18.360 --> 16:23.360
I would not let it be obliterated by an excuse of a culinary dish.

16:23.360 --> 16:28.360
Would you, punk, would you do what is right?

16:28.360 --> 16:32.360
I want you to make sure that you follow those people and you tell them.

16:32.360 --> 16:35.360
I want you to go and check out everyone who has came on to my channel today

16:35.360 --> 16:39.360
to expose this truth and tell them now I know the truth of pineapple on pizza

16:39.360 --> 16:43.360
and we can take a stand, tell them that, and they will feel reinforced

16:43.360 --> 16:45.360
to tell their stories again and again and again.

16:45.720 --> 16:47.720
Go and check them out.

16:47.720 --> 16:50.720
As for me, this might be the end.

16:50.720 --> 16:54.720
This might be the end of the right opinion as we know it.

16:54.720 --> 16:59.720
But remember, when you come to my grave, when you lay a wreath in my memoriam,

16:59.720 --> 17:03.720
I went down in a blaze of glory fighting for what was right.

17:03.720 --> 17:08.720
The eyes of history will honor my name as a crusader for the cause.

17:08.720 --> 17:13.720
Brothers, sisters, non-binaries,

17:14.080 --> 17:18.080
it is time to remember why we are here.

17:18.080 --> 17:23.080
A king, a country, a culture.

17:23.080 --> 17:28.080
Sometimes we have to take a stand to survive.

17:30.080 --> 17:33.080
I'm the right opinion and goodbye.

17:43.720 --> 17:45.720
Thank you for watching!
