0	1600	some of you will get the joke.
1600	9360	Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
9360	10700	too much free time.
10700	13480	And yes, if you're reading the title and think that I've turned into some alt-right
13480	14800	member, do not fear.
14800	19600	For those who don't understand the reference in a podcast, Francesca Ramsey, the very lovely
19600	23780	lady, attacked members of the nearby skeptic community and claimed that they made videos
23780	26700	like quote-unquote, the gays don't need rights.
26700	31440	So I'm patenting it and making it my own and taking all the power out of it that Francesca
31440	33340	so badly wanted it to give.
33340	36240	And yes, of course, despite the joke, the title is relevant to what we're talking
36240	37240	about today.
37240	39060	We'll be talking about gay rights in Australia.
39060	42580	Now Australia isn't quite like the rest of the world with its LGBT rights.
42580	46340	Although there are no laws restricting freedom of expression of one's sexuality, six states
46340	50940	currently have civil unions and two states still only recognise unregistered cohabitation.
50940	54080	Now there's no real reason for this apart from the fact that there may have been other
54080	56100	focal matters on Australia's agenda.
56100	59620	People generally are still quite friendly towards the idea of gay marriage in Australia.
59620	64060	However, now the topic is actually being brought up and a public postal survey on gay marriage
64060	65060	has been scheduled.
65060	68400	Now to my knowledge, this is completely advisory and whatever the response is, it won't be
68400	69400	set in stone.
69400	72700	The majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives support gay marriage and polling
72700	75100	has same sex marriage looking fairly strongly as well.
75100	78680	However, this is still led to response from the more conservative side of Christian Australia.
78680	81660	And today we're going to be looking at some of the most striking instance of individuals
81660	85100	putting forward discursive points against gay marriage that are being presented and
85100	88060	also looking at some of the more general points that can be made around this whole
88060	89060	scenario.
89060	92100	The poster we're going to be looking at today is obviously the most entertaining one
92100	97260	because I like entertainment, but it's also the most infamous one and the most divisive.
97260	99500	It is the notorious stop the facts.
99500	103140	This one is probably most distinct placard because of the quote facts they use.
103140	106420	When one of my friends shared this, I knew something wasn't quite right as all studies
106420	110360	I'd learned in scientific psychology the year before completely contradicted this.
110360	114280	So I did my research looking beyond the very vague questioning and I found a couple of
114280	117720	gaping holes in the study by the Catholic University of America.
117720	122960	Firstly, the NUs for same sex sample sat at only 20, which for any accomplished publisher
122960	124540	would be a huge red flag.
124540	128880	To get a real representative sample and to fall outside the margin of error, you really
128880	130840	need at least a hundred.
130840	133760	The opposite sex sample also used biological families.
133760	135480	Now you say to me, so what?
135480	139660	Well, studies also show that adopted children are much more likely to suffer developmental
139660	143480	issues like the ones listed, especially those who were adopted after the first six months
143480	144800	of their lifetime.
144800	148780	Involving biological children who naturally develop a lot more smoothly than adopted children
148780	152500	completely skews the results presented and basically renders the study invalid.
152500	156540	To serve a comparison, it would be like taking a sample of Chinese people who are all drunk
156540	160660	and then comparing their driving to a group of Mongolian people whose level of intoxication
160660	162300	are a representative sample.
162300	166300	You couldn't infer anything from the results because the state of being intoxicated serves
166300	170260	as an extraneous variable and you can't say Chinese people are wired to drive worse.
170260	174080	And for those who don't know what an extraneous variable is, it's something that unintentionally
174080	178320	influences the result and not the variable that you are looking to influence.
178320	182520	You can't compare adopted same sex children with biological opposite sex children as the
182520	186680	fact that they're adopted would play more as a variable than the nature of the parents.
186680	190180	When you actually take adopted children, almost all studies done in this area have otherwise
190180	194560	found no difference in the parenting abilities between same sex and opposite sex parents,
194560	199080	including a very in-depth meta-analysis earlier this year that summarised 79 reports on the
199080	200080	matter.
200080	201080	James Damore.
201080	204240	I was softer on him because although I believe his inferences were highly subjective, they
204240	208860	were based on legitimate research that would lead me to understand why he came to his conclusion,
208860	211040	although the conclusion is very debatable.
211040	214960	I don't believe he has an ulterior agenda beyond his opinion and I respect that.
214960	219460	When you have a poster that uses basically research that is unbelievably flawed to try
219460	223380	and undermine a discussion, I don't care what discussion that is, you lose it.
223380	229320	If for all social implications this research was somehow true, it would have to be considered.
229320	230760	And that's what annoys me the most.
230760	235320	I have berated the regressive left for their dismissal of scientific research points and
235320	239240	their attitude to protect feelings rather than protect truths, but what's worse than
239240	244360	completely dismissing science is insidiously using defective research to suit an agenda.
244360	248920	There has to be no doubt in this guy's mind, surely, that he knew exactly what he did when
248920	253560	he compared over 12,000 opposite sex parents to 20 same sex parents.
253560	257800	Like, alright, no one's forcing him to get on board with gay rights, but if you want
257800	262560	discussion about it, don't fake research, because to me that says you don't have real
262560	263920	points otherwise.
263920	268040	And yeah, I am pro-gay marriage, so maybe I am biased, and that's because I'm pro-equal
268040	271400	opportunity and I think people should have the opportunity to marry and start a family
271400	274320	as long as those rights don't infringe on other persons.
274320	277820	And I'm never one for excessive rights, and as you know I've been calling it out all year
277820	281560	on my channel, but for me it's not excessive to have legislative equality.
281560	285200	Gay marriage wouldn't be exclusivity, it'd be inclusivity.
285200	289320	But that's my own thoughts on that, and to be honest I really just wanted to focus on
289320	292620	the more specific points regarding the study that was presented.
292620	295320	All I want is a debate using honest facts.
295320	298700	But if you have anything else you'd like to say, I'd love to hear it, I'm all for debate
298700	303240	and as you know I'm always active in my comment sections, so just drop a line my way if you
303240	304400	want my thoughts on it.
304400	308160	I've also got open DMs on my Twitter, so you can hit me up there too.
308160	310320	I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
