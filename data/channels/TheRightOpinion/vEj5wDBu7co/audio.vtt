00:00.000 --> 00:01.600
some of you will get the joke.

00:01.600 --> 00:09.360
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:09.360 --> 00:10.700
too much free time.

00:10.700 --> 00:13.480
And yes, if you're reading the title and think that I've turned into some alt-right

00:13.480 --> 00:14.800
member, do not fear.

00:14.800 --> 00:19.600
For those who don't understand the reference in a podcast, Francesca Ramsey, the very lovely

00:19.600 --> 00:23.780
lady, attacked members of the nearby skeptic community and claimed that they made videos

00:23.780 --> 00:26.700
like quote-unquote, the gays don't need rights.

00:26.700 --> 00:31.440
So I'm patenting it and making it my own and taking all the power out of it that Francesca

00:31.440 --> 00:33.340
so badly wanted it to give.

00:33.340 --> 00:36.240
And yes, of course, despite the joke, the title is relevant to what we're talking

00:36.240 --> 00:37.240
about today.

00:37.240 --> 00:39.060
We'll be talking about gay rights in Australia.

00:39.060 --> 00:42.580
Now Australia isn't quite like the rest of the world with its LGBT rights.

00:42.580 --> 00:46.340
Although there are no laws restricting freedom of expression of one's sexuality, six states

00:46.340 --> 00:50.940
currently have civil unions and two states still only recognise unregistered cohabitation.

00:50.940 --> 00:54.080
Now there's no real reason for this apart from the fact that there may have been other

00:54.080 --> 00:56.100
focal matters on Australia's agenda.

00:56.100 --> 00:59.620
People generally are still quite friendly towards the idea of gay marriage in Australia.

00:59.620 --> 01:04.060
However, now the topic is actually being brought up and a public postal survey on gay marriage

01:04.060 --> 01:05.060
has been scheduled.

01:05.060 --> 01:08.400
Now to my knowledge, this is completely advisory and whatever the response is, it won't be

01:08.400 --> 01:09.400
set in stone.

01:09.400 --> 01:12.700
The majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives support gay marriage and polling

01:12.700 --> 01:15.100
has same sex marriage looking fairly strongly as well.

01:15.100 --> 01:18.680
However, this is still led to response from the more conservative side of Christian Australia.

01:18.680 --> 01:21.660
And today we're going to be looking at some of the most striking instance of individuals

01:21.660 --> 01:25.100
putting forward discursive points against gay marriage that are being presented and

01:25.100 --> 01:28.060
also looking at some of the more general points that can be made around this whole

01:28.060 --> 01:29.060
scenario.

01:29.060 --> 01:32.100
The poster we're going to be looking at today is obviously the most entertaining one

01:32.100 --> 01:37.260
because I like entertainment, but it's also the most infamous one and the most divisive.

01:37.260 --> 01:39.500
It is the notorious stop the facts.

01:39.500 --> 01:43.140
This one is probably most distinct placard because of the quote facts they use.

01:43.140 --> 01:46.420
When one of my friends shared this, I knew something wasn't quite right as all studies

01:46.420 --> 01:50.360
I'd learned in scientific psychology the year before completely contradicted this.

01:50.360 --> 01:54.280
So I did my research looking beyond the very vague questioning and I found a couple of

01:54.280 --> 01:57.720
gaping holes in the study by the Catholic University of America.

01:57.720 --> 02:02.960
Firstly, the NUs for same sex sample sat at only 20, which for any accomplished publisher

02:02.960 --> 02:04.540
would be a huge red flag.

02:04.540 --> 02:08.880
To get a real representative sample and to fall outside the margin of error, you really

02:08.880 --> 02:10.840
need at least a hundred.

02:10.840 --> 02:13.760
The opposite sex sample also used biological families.

02:13.760 --> 02:15.480
Now you say to me, so what?

02:15.480 --> 02:19.660
Well, studies also show that adopted children are much more likely to suffer developmental

02:19.660 --> 02:23.480
issues like the ones listed, especially those who were adopted after the first six months

02:23.480 --> 02:24.800
of their lifetime.

02:24.800 --> 02:28.780
Involving biological children who naturally develop a lot more smoothly than adopted children

02:28.780 --> 02:32.500
completely skews the results presented and basically renders the study invalid.

02:32.500 --> 02:36.540
To serve a comparison, it would be like taking a sample of Chinese people who are all drunk

02:36.540 --> 02:40.660
and then comparing their driving to a group of Mongolian people whose level of intoxication

02:40.660 --> 02:42.300
are a representative sample.

02:42.300 --> 02:46.300
You couldn't infer anything from the results because the state of being intoxicated serves

02:46.300 --> 02:50.260
as an extraneous variable and you can't say Chinese people are wired to drive worse.

02:50.260 --> 02:54.080
And for those who don't know what an extraneous variable is, it's something that unintentionally

02:54.080 --> 02:58.320
influences the result and not the variable that you are looking to influence.

02:58.320 --> 03:02.520
You can't compare adopted same sex children with biological opposite sex children as the

03:02.520 --> 03:06.680
fact that they're adopted would play more as a variable than the nature of the parents.

03:06.680 --> 03:10.180
When you actually take adopted children, almost all studies done in this area have otherwise

03:10.180 --> 03:14.560
found no difference in the parenting abilities between same sex and opposite sex parents,

03:14.560 --> 03:19.080
including a very in-depth meta-analysis earlier this year that summarised 79 reports on the

03:19.080 --> 03:20.080
matter.

03:20.080 --> 03:21.080
James Damore.

03:21.080 --> 03:24.240
I was softer on him because although I believe his inferences were highly subjective, they

03:24.240 --> 03:28.860
were based on legitimate research that would lead me to understand why he came to his conclusion,

03:28.860 --> 03:31.040
although the conclusion is very debatable.

03:31.040 --> 03:34.960
I don't believe he has an ulterior agenda beyond his opinion and I respect that.

03:34.960 --> 03:39.460
When you have a poster that uses basically research that is unbelievably flawed to try

03:39.460 --> 03:43.380
and undermine a discussion, I don't care what discussion that is, you lose it.

03:43.380 --> 03:49.320
If for all social implications this research was somehow true, it would have to be considered.

03:49.320 --> 03:50.760
And that's what annoys me the most.

03:50.760 --> 03:55.320
I have berated the regressive left for their dismissal of scientific research points and

03:55.320 --> 03:59.240
their attitude to protect feelings rather than protect truths, but what's worse than

03:59.240 --> 04:04.360
completely dismissing science is insidiously using defective research to suit an agenda.

04:04.360 --> 04:08.920
There has to be no doubt in this guy's mind, surely, that he knew exactly what he did when

04:08.920 --> 04:13.560
he compared over 12,000 opposite sex parents to 20 same sex parents.

04:13.560 --> 04:17.800
Like, alright, no one's forcing him to get on board with gay rights, but if you want

04:17.800 --> 04:22.560
discussion about it, don't fake research, because to me that says you don't have real

04:22.560 --> 04:23.920
points otherwise.

04:23.920 --> 04:28.040
And yeah, I am pro-gay marriage, so maybe I am biased, and that's because I'm pro-equal

04:28.040 --> 04:31.400
opportunity and I think people should have the opportunity to marry and start a family

04:31.400 --> 04:34.320
as long as those rights don't infringe on other persons.

04:34.320 --> 04:37.820
And I'm never one for excessive rights, and as you know I've been calling it out all year

04:37.820 --> 04:41.560
on my channel, but for me it's not excessive to have legislative equality.

04:41.560 --> 04:45.200
Gay marriage wouldn't be exclusivity, it'd be inclusivity.

04:45.200 --> 04:49.320
But that's my own thoughts on that, and to be honest I really just wanted to focus on

04:49.320 --> 04:52.620
the more specific points regarding the study that was presented.

04:52.620 --> 04:55.320
All I want is a debate using honest facts.

04:55.320 --> 04:58.700
But if you have anything else you'd like to say, I'd love to hear it, I'm all for debate

04:58.700 --> 05:03.240
and as you know I'm always active in my comment sections, so just drop a line my way if you

05:03.240 --> 05:04.400
want my thoughts on it.

05:04.400 --> 05:08.160
I've also got open DMs on my Twitter, so you can hit me up there too.

05:08.160 --> 05:10.320
I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
