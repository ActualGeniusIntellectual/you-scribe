00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,120
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,600
too much free time, and 50,000, a fantastic feat, and to be honest, I was going to continue

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,840
on my normal schedule, I'm a guy with plenty of ideas, and I already have 10 other video

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,400
ideas written down, how am I going to get to them if I waste time with these sorts of

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,000
ceremonials? Well, honestly, I think I just need a break. In case you didn't know, I'm

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,180
a student of Politics, Philosophy, and International Law with a minor in Psychology, and those

7
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,560
courses definitely take their toll, especially when you're bashing out a ten page script

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,680
every week. It's about time management, and so having a script that I can hopefully handle

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,600
more efficiently this week will give me less stress, because a huge part of scripting is

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,200
also research and watching through these videos to see what sort of spicy takes we can formulate

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,360
on these topics. I have a twitter, and on that twitter I put out a tweet asking for

12
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,720
questions for that video, if you don't have a twitter, I apologise, next time I'll put

13
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,640
it on my community tab as well, so you can all pose questions, though I'm not sure when

14
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,680
I'll do something like this next. The Q&A is going to be done in an interesting way,

15
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,480
as I received over 200 questions, there will be some that I won't be able to respond to,

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,200
especially more meme-y ones, however I will be cataloguing the questions into a general

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,920
topic and will just walk through them, hopefully addressing various questions and knocking

18
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,240
them out of the park in a fairly efficient manner. There's a lot to discuss, and I don't

19
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,360
know how long this will take, but there are a few things that I want to get out of the

20
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,000
way that I'd normally put at the end, however as it's a special occasion, we'll run with

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,240
a special structure. I really want to thank my visual editors, without them I just would

22
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,480
never have the time nor the patience to make these videos, they do such a sensational job,

23
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,600
and if you do have the chance I'm going to leave links in the pinned comments below to

24
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,920
anyone who has edited for me in the last couple months, please go and send them some love.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,960
I also want to thank anyone who has sought out my Patreon and donated, I barely ever

26
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,440
mention it, so the fact that people do actually see the kind of meme at the end of the video

27
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,040
and click on it is kind of impressive, however I do want to take this time out on that to

28
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,520
make an announcement. I am going to be conducting a serious reform of rewards, firstly because

29
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,560
barely anyone claims them, most people just insist they want to donate for the content,

30
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,640
secondly because as always mentioned, most people can attain these rewards without paying

31
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,600
regardless, I do my best to be an open person, and I thought that might come under siege

32
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,280
as I've grown, but I've handled it pretty alright to be honest. Thirdly because of my

33
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,160
current setup it makes it significantly harder to follow through on many of the rewards and

34
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,200
I don't want to make commitments that I can't keep, it's never fun letting people down,

35
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,120
if you've donated before this video then you're still entitled to the rewards committed prior

36
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,840
and will sort something out. They're the only two special announcements that I have to make,

37
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,960
obviously all my mates and YouTube colleagues know how much love I have for them and that

38
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,440
will never change, I'm not going to list them out here but keep hustling boys. Anyhow, with

39
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,600
the pleasantries out the way I want to cut into the crux of this video because there

40
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,720
is a lot to discuss, a lot of things about me to discuss. I had a lot of questions on

41
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,400
my identity, either from people who wanted to know more about me or people who were just

42
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,400
confused that I'd appeared on their timeline. My name is James, I'm a British individual

43
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,160
enrolled in a Dutch university currently studying in America, South Carolina to be exact, though

44
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,720
I do have to return to the Netherlands to complete my degree, I don't know where I'll

45
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,040
go after that, probably to London and then eventually hopefully back to the US. In real

46
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,960
life I dress like most people dress, with clothes, so I do not seek to wear formal attire

47
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,760
in the South Carolina environment, that would be rather foolish, although I have seen a

48
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,800
couple people wearing black blazers and do wonder if they were right. A lot of people

49
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,560
question the legitimacy of my accent, but I promise you it is completely who I am, and

50
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,400
you can ask anyone who's had the pleasure of meeting me in person. People also compare

51
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,760
my accent to Colossal's, we're both from the same general area with a similar upbringing

52
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,640
so it's understandable that we may have a similar accent. To anyone wondering about

53
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,580
how to have this accent themselves, I'm really sorry, I do not know what the specific

54
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,600
settings on the vocal chords are, but if I do find out I'll definitely inform you. A

55
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,200
lot of people also ask me about my persona. I really don't know what made me go with

56
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,240
the style, but eventually it just stuck. It's appropriate for my character because of how

57
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,860
I speak and how I behave when dealing with these topics in an academic manner, which

58
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,360
is definitely something. I deal with YouTube drama not in a dissimilar way in my videos

59
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,760
than I would deal with a spoken dissertation, plus some more jokes and colloquialisms thrown

60
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,140
in there, and in a way that's what I think sets myself apart. Another person asked how

61
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,520
much my persona and my personality are different, and that's where I wanted to precursor this

62
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,760
sentence. When I'm writing out a script, I'm obviously going to be approaching it with

63
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,560
a different attitude than if I dealt with these things spontaneously. There are many

64
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,760
elements and interests pertaining to me that are fairly regular, but I guess I'm just

65
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,920
a more quirky and brooding person, which is what sets me apart in a way. I'm not socially

66
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,900
awkward, though I'm not a fan of large groups of strangers. Some people have asked me about

67
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,460
my music career, as I have said in the past that I am actually a trained singer. I've

68
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,140
also done songwriting and even released a few singles under an alias. The songs didn't

69
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,320
do anything because I didn't have any access to promotional materials, but one day I hope

70
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,280
that I will and I will be able to pursue a career in it. I love music, that's the one

71
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,500
thing that I can never have too much of. I can't think of too many other things to

72
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,660
say about myself apart from an elephant in the room that will be receiving its own part

73
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,340
once I've dealt with another hot topic.

74
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:12,620
Let me make one thing clear, this is my first proper channel. I have not had any projects

75
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,060
prior to this one. I used to make political content, I think most people know that. I

76
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,380
still integrate levels of political logic into my videos, but I do not comment on specific

77
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,700
political events often, unless I really do have a strong feeling. There are many reasons

78
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,540
to that, and given that some people were here while I was still covering those topics, I

79
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:34,820
thought I'd explain. Politically, I'm left-wing. I'm not really left-wing, but I'm left-wing.

80
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,260
Now, that has been the case for years, since the inception of my YouTube channel, and when

81
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,760
I first started up, my channel bashed a lot of politicians of the British Conservative

82
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,340
Party, and dealt with issues that were extremely niche in a way. Now, I've gone to three

83
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,140
universities, I won't say too much else, but the first university was not good, and

84
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:56,060
there were a fair few people who were the sort of stereotype that you see in the sort

85
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,020
of cringe compilations that were the rage on YouTuber, I had a situation where I received

86
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:05,020
verbal abuse. It's the sort of thing where you just react, you see these people who are

87
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,740
such a piss-take of everything that you want to stand for, and you see them running things

88
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,860
that you even might believe in, into the ground, and it pissed me off. I made a set of videos

89
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,540
based off that reaction, and so to the people who asked me if there was a specific video

90
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,820
I regret or dislike the most, no, but there are videos that I certainly don't feel the

91
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,020
same way about now, and were made on a whim of emotions, feelings that felt justified

92
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,780
at the time, but really could have used a second voice to ask me if I really wanted

93
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,660
to upload that content. How helpful is that to the conversation? If you want to watch

94
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,980
my old videos, then be my guest. At the end of the day, arguments don't have an identity,

95
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,580
but if you want to know if I still endorse those beliefs, it might be best to speak to

96
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:48,060
me personally. I left political content for a load of reasons, partly because I wanted

97
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,820
some more time to find myself on the political spectrum, a lot of my views are still evolving,

98
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,300
and I definitely took the plunge very early originally. Political YouTube was also going

99
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,100
in a direction that seemed very questionable, you were either with them, or against them.

100
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,240
I'd started to grow tired of the rhetoric employed by a lot of creators, and it began

101
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,240
to show. After a run-in with fanboys over Tom McDonald's White Boy, a song that I still

102
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,740
personally think is really bad, I decided that I needed to re-evaluate what I wanted

103
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,500
to do with my channel. Generally, I don't like to say that someone is bad from their

104
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,980
opinion, I want to make content that I can have fun doing, I just didn't receive that

105
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:28,460
pleasure from continuing down the route I was taking. It was toxic, it was very toxic,

106
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,100
that won't mean I won't address the political things in the future, but they won't be

107
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,400
the centre of the video. I want to be the best I can be, and I think that results from

108
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,420
a level of information, and I don't think anyone's really nailed it yet, even though

109
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:44,140
there are some creators that I do respect in what they're doing, there is none that

110
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,000
I do not find fault with. On top of this, there are a lot of reactionaries, and people

111
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,820
with pre-aligned agendas, I look forward to the day when we can all tackle topics with

112
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:56,020
a bit more nuance. With the current topics that I'm choosing, I will very rarely avoid

113
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,740
something just because I believe it's too controversial, and that's my ethos, I decide

114
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:05,140
to take things on, on my interest and my confidence in handling it. Controversy doesn't really

115
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:09,240
factor in, if there's a controversial incident that I think I can handle well, then I'll

116
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,460
do it. With regards to my best video, it is a hard one, because I feel that all of my

117
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,160
newest videos are a step up from my old ones. I'd probably lean towards the animators

118
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,500
video with regards to presentation, maybe Lil Tay with the level of information that

119
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,960
was revealed, but it's difficult, I'll admit that. Really, I only plan to grow my content

120
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,740
and keep working on the imperfections, which there are. I'm very comfortable with certain

121
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,760
elements, but I definitely look forward to a time when I have more opportunity to research

122
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,160
and be involved in the process, because at that point, you won't be able to save the

123
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,600
subjects of my videos. And I'm in my last year of uni, so a lot longer to go now my

124
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,900
friends. I'm hoping that by this time next year, we'll have opportunities all round really.

125
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,700
With regards to the lengths of my videos and whether I'll return to making shorter videos,

126
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,500
I feel that the problem with my shorter videos was that they just didn't carry an impact,

127
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,340
they didn't possess the same weight that my longer videos do. My longer videos just allow

128
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:05,520
me to do more, to create a convincing environment, or allow me to make a piece reflective, or

129
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,560
whatever. I want people to have a reason to watch my videos, I feel that was lacking in

130
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,420
A lot of people also asked me what inspired me to originally create content, and honestly,

131
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,360
although I was vaguely familiar with many YouTubers who I did greatly enjoy, the main

132
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,140
reason was boredom. I was still coming from a pretty emotionally dark place of January

133
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,440
2016, and one of my friends had a channel where he made gaming content, and I thought

134
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,240
that I might be able to do something with that, and I thought, well, maybe he can give

135
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,820
me some advice. I knew that I had some talent with regards to creating scripts and such,

136
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,980
I just wasn't technically quite there. However, at the time, Vanilla Rice, a friend

137
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,960
of mine who I'll also link in the description below, offered to help me with editing free

138
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,340
of charge, so I guess I should thank him, because without him, the channel would never

139
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,500
have left the ground in the first place. He's really important to my life, and I don't

140
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,660
think I can ever deny that. It was probably also a part investment, as he assumed if I

141
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,300
blew up, I'd help him out too, and he's right about that. We'll definitely collaborate

142
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,500
again soon. I want to do something more with my life, I wanted to go to a market that wasn't

143
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,780
impossible to access and inspire me, YouTube did that, and I hope it doesn't go away

144
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:16,620
too soon, because I love it, and I love everyone who's supported me through it. But what

145
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:21,460
about the future? Will I ever return to politics? Will I move towards other content? I don't

146
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:26,380
know if I'll ever return to hardcore politics, even if the landscape significantly changes,

147
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:31,020
mainly because if I want to make my political change in the world, which I do actually care

148
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,540
about, I think it'll be beyond YouTube. With regards to music, and film, and so on,

149
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,740
yes, I will almost definitely move towards that, and I was speaking to some other popular

150
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,400
film channels about a possible collaboration project, but I want to think of a proper spicy

151
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,940
take before I move in on it. I love music, and it's also very possible I'll return

152
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,540
to that, I almost did recently, but just didn't quite feel happy with the material. When it

153
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:58,300
comes to my career goals, if my YouTube failed tomorrow, then my life would go on. I'm

154
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:03,220
working hard beyond to try and make sure that I can support myself whatever the circumstances,

155
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,940
because YouTube is very unpredictable. My ideal scenario is that this all takes off,

156
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,620
and in five years time, I'm living in the commentary equivalent of FaZe House with the

157
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:16,100
boys. But life is strange, and sometimes things don't turn out that way. At the end of the

158
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,860
day, I'm making content that firstly I care about, and secondly my audience cares about.

159
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,860
I do my best to strike the balance, because I don't know how long this will last, but

160
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,820
I'm glad I've had the opportunity. I really do hope I reach 100k. When people ask me how

161
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,880
I stay motivated in these scenarios, my reply is really, I just think about how good the

162
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,980
finished product will be. I never want to miss an opportunity, and even though it might

163
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,740
not feel like high stakes at the time, you don't know what you may be passing up on.

164
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:50,620
Another big question I receive about my channel is my name. Why the right opinion? I genuinely

165
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:55,580
can't remember the backstory behind it. I think it was a fairly spontaneous decision,

166
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,760
and it's not something that was given too much thought at the time. Honestly, I'm really

167
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,040
bad with names typically, and so the fact that it just popped into my head, I've never

168
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,020
had a second thought about it. You know, you just gotta take all you can get in those positions.

169
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:12,060
It is of course ironic, and when people are tapping me over it, it is quite amusing. As

170
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:17,020
for my opinions on other content, I do like to take the idea that content is generally

171
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:22,000
quite subjective, however, there is definitely a warring level of low-effort culture, clickbait

172
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,900
over content, and really, I do not care about clickbait too much if your content is worth

173
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:31,620
the click, but you see some people whose videos are completely coasting on the thumbnails

174
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,700
and the titles, and it's rather sad. Do not fear though, I'll make sure everyone gets

175
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,700
their just desserts. With regards to what I watch, I don't really have many channels

176
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,260
that I consider guilty pleasures. As said before, I watch a lot of review channels.

177
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,640
Typically, my go-to channel at the moment is I Hate Everything. On top of this, I also

178
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,940
watch a lot of my friends' channels because I want to support their content. Currently,

179
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,200
university is really pushing time against me, and therefore I do not have the time to

180
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,560
watch content that I do not consider necessary to my life, and I have to watch videos for

181
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,700
research purposes anyway. I have enough to sort out. With regards to my favourite content

182
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,600
creators, Colossal is crazy when he uploads, and Nerd City are definitely up there, especially

183
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,680
with the level of detail that they tend to go into. With regards to smaller creators,

184
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,120
my favourite channel under 1,000 subs is Average Pixel. Trouble is, he's suffering

185
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,680
from a bout of Colossal Syndrome. I'm trying to encourage him to have another video out,

186
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,640
but I think the lack of reception has previously made him slightly cautious, but he is a fantastic

187
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,040
guy, and if any of you can go and show him some love, it might just motivate him. I'll

188
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,800
leave his links in the pinned comment below. And yes, it is true, I have scrapped many

189
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,040
many videos in my time, either because I didn't think I was ready to tackle it yet, or I was

190
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,880
mildly worried at the time whether I'd thought it through. But recently, that concern

191
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,160
has gone to the wind, and I've realised that sometimes you just gotta run with it.

192
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,600
But I'd say I've scrapped around 20 videos in my time, and as mentioned earlier, I have

193
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,760
10 videos lined up, and probably more when I think about it. The only other question

194
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,920
I think I received on this topic was about when I thought I'd stop growing, and honestly,

195
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,780
you want my honest opinion? When I first started up this channel, I thought I'd stop at 3,000,

196
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,960
so the fact that we made it to 50 is something else, really. I think that sums up questions

197
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:17,380
about my content, so now we have to address one of the most popular types of question.

198
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:22,040
I'm an open person. I'm open about my struggles, my hardships, and things that other people

199
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,660
may not be so forward about. There are obviously things that are off limits, but I still think

200
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:31,140
if I'm open about these topics, it might help others. That's important. I'd say around

201
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:36,180
maybe 30% of my fans know this, maybe more, but yes, I am gay. I don't feel the need to

202
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:40,340
make a coming out video, because I'm already out pretty publicly, and at the end of the

203
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:45,260
day, it doesn't factor into my content usually. I am who I am. If it's ever necessary to

204
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,740
bring up as a point of interest, then I shout, but I've seldom encountered the topics.

205
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:54,380
I really began coming to terms with it when I was 18, so I'm a bit behind in many ways.

206
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,780
It was weird, because I was constantly used to environments where it was never really

207
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:04,480
considered a possibility. I was just waiting to be attracted to females, and it never happened,

208
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,400
which is something that does still affect me to this day. I think if I had been able

209
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:13,940
to acknowledge it, at least as a possibility earlier, it may have been easier growing into.

210
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,340
As a person, I'm slightly fragile in that area, and I'm still trying to work myself out.

211
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:22,520
A lot of people used to ask, so I put it in my Twitter bio. However, since I put it in

212
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,720
my Twitter bio, a lot of people seem to think it's an ironic joke, probably referring to

213
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:34,760
the other meaning of gay. And yes, I understand that, but I am homosexual. Got it? Good.

214
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,300
Some people have asked me how gay I behave outside of my videos. I guess when they refer

215
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:45,120
to gay, they are talking about these stereotypes, and the sort of flamboyant, very camp behaviours.

216
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,840
And I am definitely by no means masculine, I do have a bit of an exuberant personality

217
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:54,840
when I choose to, but I'd say my brand is probably more subdued, so on a gay scale of

218
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,520
1-10, I'd say typically around a 4, with the mild acknowledgement that it may have

219
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,400
a tendency to increase in situations in which I'm excited. I might make the occasional

220
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,880
self-referential joke about it, and that's fine, I make jokes, I'm someone who enjoys

221
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,280
a bit of banter, I think it actually makes me more comfortable with who I am, but I will

222
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,760
not overdo it. Also I received this very interesting question which was put forward, why do I wear

223
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:23,040
a coat, which is in reference to the time I went to Insomnia gaming festival, and was

224
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,520
only seen in a coat at all times. Firstly, at Insomnia, every night I did not have a

225
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,880
good sleep, and when I'm sleep deprived, I typically feel colder. And secondly, one

226
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,560
of the more unstable things about me is my weight, it has a tendency to increase and

227
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,520
decrease, and honestly, I don't think I've been happy with it for a while. It's funny

228
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,640
because I know that it's far from bad or anything, but the coat just makes me more

229
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,400
comfortable in such environments. This might cause you to hypothesise, it's why I hide

230
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,760
myself from the camera. Although partly true, I'm still unaware of how to balance face

231
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:00,480
cam with non-face cam, whereas face cam works in a more casual environment with less structure,

232
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,360
scripted content kinda contradicts that, and it's hard to do that with the camera. I

233
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:09,820
don't always wear a coat, and in fact, in VidCon 2018, I had no other option but to

234
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:16,280
brace the Californian heat, and I hated every single photo of me. It seems so easy to identify

235
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,940
the little things that you want to correct about yourself. As I said, I have one more

236
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,760
year in university, and then I expect to have more of an opportunity to get into shape.

237
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,820
It does not help that university and YouTube both pile a fair amount of stress onto me

238
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,980
that I don't really have time to stay in great form, but that time will come afterwards,

239
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:37,740
I have plans to sort it all out and finish it all this coming summer, and then I won't

240
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,320
have to think about it again, but if you do see me before then, just know that I will

241
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,300
have everything under control one day. If I was to see my younger self, I don't know

242
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:50,220
if I'd give him any advice, mainly because in spite of his numerous flaws, errors, and

243
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,460
every single imperfection that he hated about himself, the desperate longing for socialist

244
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,380
acceptance mixed with a whirlwind of volatile sentiments, he turned into this person, which

245
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,960
once again, is still a work in progress, but is pretty unique in many ways, and is still

246
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,540
striving to be better. Sometimes, those things are so fragile that you wouldn't want to

247
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:13,460
intervene with a younger version of you because you don't know what you might change, and

248
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,840
even if you give good advice, it may not go the way you want it to. I think the best

249
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,100
advice I'd always give to my younger self is that it's important to put the moments

250
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,380
of childhood into perspective, and although it was a fairly turbulent time and plagued

251
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:30,980
with a lot of problems, that you'll emerge as a stronger person from it, because you

252
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,980
have to believe you can do better. With regards to advice to a more recent version of myself,

253
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:41,300
notably a version of me with less subscribers, I'd just tell him to always keep on working

254
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:46,240
on improving, and to keep working on perfecting it. That's a philosophy that I always keep

255
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,320
up, stay on that grind my friends, stay on that grind.

256
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,900
And the last question I wanted to get out about this personal moment was my most controversial

257
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,920
opinion. We all have them, it's okay, you're allowed to have controversial opinions. My

258
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:05,680
one is probably about the European Union, given context. As a left-wing student living

259
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,500
in the international world, it seems stereotypical for many to assume that I'd love the European

260
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,140
project. But out of all my opinions that have changed over the years, the one that

261
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:19,160
has remained steadfast is that the European Union are not to be trusted, and if we outsource

262
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:24,300
sovereignty to them, it will make it much easier for corporations to influence how laws

263
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:29,720
are made that affect our lives, and our influence as civilians will be further diluted. I could

264
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,620
go on forever about how much I do to test the European Union. Does it mean I enjoy Brexit?

265
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,760
No, far from it, but it's such a catch-22, it's one of the things that I've never really

266
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,040
budged on, and have convinced a few people on it too. I think that's the personal questions

267
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,660
done about me. Once again, if you have anything else you want to throw in my way, then I'm

268
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,060
always open. Let's talk about the questions that were harder to categorise.

269
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,480
I do have a lot of questions about my relationship with editors, how I've accumulated so many

270
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,320
why I appear to have such a sound working relationship with them. There are a lot of

271
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,200
responses that I can make to this, but the first thing is none of my editors are just

272
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,880
random strangers, a high majority of my editors have approached me, and the few that I approached

273
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,620
were either people who followed me and I'd heard good things about, or mutual friends

274
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:19,600
already. This immediately elevates the alliance, I love all of them really, they're all really

275
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,380
sound people, which is why I always try and push them out there without bothering my audience

276
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:30,280
too much. For so many creators it seems almost taboo to give credit to your videos to anyone

277
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,800
else, but I want to let people know that this is not just me, this is a great collaboration

278
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:40,200
of fantastic people, it's such a mutual energy, and if they're good content creators

279
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,860
then I might even offer them parts in my videos in the future. I try and make their experience

280
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,400
editing my videos enjoyable ones, I try and organise it well at the end of the day, some

281
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,280
of them might see this as an investment because although I can't throw copious amounts of

282
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,780
money at them right now, they might see me as the sort of person who'll pay them back

283
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:02,500
if I make it, and once again, they're kinda right on that. I am someone who wants to help

284
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,860
out those who've looked out for me, because if you're rich and successful, a lot of fair

285
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:11,380
weather friends tend to materialise. These people have been here from the start, they

286
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,180
had faith in me when I didn't have faith in myself. You don't want to reach the top

287
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:19,520
and start searching for friends, that's never a good philosophy, so these lads will

288
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,420
always get enough of the true love.

289
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:28,280
I wanted to address some of the more slightly spontaneous questions here, ones that just

290
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,240
came out of nowhere, and topics that were a bit more casual and lacking specificity

291
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,640
to me exactly. With regards to music, my favourite artist is Elton John, up there is Queen,

292
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,440
the Electric Light Orchestra, and Robbie Williams. It's an interesting combination of musicians

293
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,440
I'm aware, but my music taste is extremely eclectic, and as I'm writing this script

294
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,280
currently, it just transitioned from Miss Right by Anderson Park to We Built This City

295
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:55,120
by Starship. Any music that can invoke an emotion from me, which isn't discussed of

296
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,680
course, normally receives a thumbs up, even if it's cheesy and goofy at points. With

297
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,400
regards to films, my favourite film if you haven't worked it out already is Hot Fuzz,

298
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,060
and I make numerous subtle and not-so-subtle references in my videos alluding to it. I

299
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,940
think it's a brilliant film, and nothing can ever touch it, like, it just spoils me

300
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:19,280
with how wonderful it is. A lot of films don't have rewatch value to me, so any film that

301
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,020
can do that as a first is already a cut above the rest, and boy, I've watched that damn

302
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:28,420
masterpiece so many times, and will regularly show my friends just to see their reaction.

303
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:32,660
I also received questions about whether I'm interested in anime. Unfortunately, I haven't

304
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:37,120
had the time to invest myself in the particular genre too much, but it is the sort of thing

305
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,240
that I could see myself enjoying. I've watched a couple of anime films, and they are just

306
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,900
beautiful, like unbelievable art. I do really think it's kinda magical. With regards to

307
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:51,480
video games, I'm a sucker for GTA V. I played that game for so much time when I was younger,

308
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,420
I missed the times when I didn't have to worry about an exam every two weeks, and actually

309
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:00,300
could use the leisure time to sit back and crack out a game like GTA V. It was just so

310
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,280
cathartic. I made a ton of money, bought a ton of weaponry, vehicles, everything. If

311
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,880
it was available at the time, I bought it. It was a game that invested my ambition into

312
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,900
a new energy. It was just so immensely fun. I didn't play many other games, admittedly,

313
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,560
so if I haven't responded to your specific questions about video games, then that's

314
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,840
probably why. I haven't played it. I also played the Call of Duty series, and a bit

315
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,920
of Fortnite, but honestly, I'm mainly anticipating the Call of Duty Royale. I can never really

316
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,160
acclimatise to the building on Fortnite, so I'm looking forward to having the controller

317
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:37,400
at the helm, and a more classic style. Someone also asked my opinion on furries, and to be

318
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,580
honest, I have noticed that I do have a fairly prominent furry fanbase. I don't mind. At

319
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:46,620
the end of the day, we're all individuals, I do not care if you're a furry or not,

320
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,120
as long as you're a lovely person, and I know people who are furries who are really

321
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,940
friendly to me. The person who made my channel banner is a furry, so I don't really care

322
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,180
what you do with the anthropomorphic personas. The fursuits though, they do intimidate me

323
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:04,120
a bit, like for real, like look at those eyes. It's like they're staring into my soul.

324
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,440
Another person also asked how I respond to people when they ask me how much I earn. I

325
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,380
tend to throw out a vague amount of money for the month with a precondition that it

326
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:16,680
does vary, depending on my upload schedule, and also depending on how well the videos

327
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,880
do. Some videos also have better CPM than others, sometimes YouTube loves me, sometimes

328
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,920
YouTube hates me. Someone who I really have to answer to also asked what my top 5 Taylor

329
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:31,360
Swift songs are, and I'd say Wildest Dreams, Begin Again, Call It What You Want, Style,

330
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,480
and Getaway Car. I admit, I actually don't mind country music, but I'm not really crazy

331
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,200
about Taylor Swift's country phase, I think it's just aged rather badly on me. Also, I

332
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,020
like bananas, I like beans, and I certainly do not like fucking pineapple on pizza, and

333
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,020
do not ask me about that shit again. Good night.

334
00:24:49,020 --> 00:25:08,440
This was PRPLPRNCH, and I'm out!
