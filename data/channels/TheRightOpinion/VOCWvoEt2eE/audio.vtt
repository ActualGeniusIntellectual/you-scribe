00:00.000 --> 00:12.120
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:12.120 --> 00:17.600
too much free time, and 50,000, a fantastic feat, and to be honest, I was going to continue

00:17.600 --> 00:21.840
on my normal schedule, I'm a guy with plenty of ideas, and I already have 10 other video

00:21.840 --> 00:25.400
ideas written down, how am I going to get to them if I waste time with these sorts of

00:25.400 --> 00:30.000
ceremonials? Well, honestly, I think I just need a break. In case you didn't know, I'm

00:30.000 --> 00:34.180
a student of Politics, Philosophy, and International Law with a minor in Psychology, and those

00:34.180 --> 00:38.560
courses definitely take their toll, especially when you're bashing out a ten page script

00:38.560 --> 00:42.680
every week. It's about time management, and so having a script that I can hopefully handle

00:42.680 --> 00:46.600
more efficiently this week will give me less stress, because a huge part of scripting is

00:46.600 --> 00:51.200
also research and watching through these videos to see what sort of spicy takes we can formulate

00:51.200 --> 00:56.360
on these topics. I have a twitter, and on that twitter I put out a tweet asking for

00:56.360 --> 01:00.720
questions for that video, if you don't have a twitter, I apologise, next time I'll put

01:00.720 --> 01:04.640
it on my community tab as well, so you can all pose questions, though I'm not sure when

01:04.640 --> 01:08.680
I'll do something like this next. The Q&A is going to be done in an interesting way,

01:08.680 --> 01:12.480
as I received over 200 questions, there will be some that I won't be able to respond to,

01:12.480 --> 01:17.200
especially more meme-y ones, however I will be cataloguing the questions into a general

01:17.200 --> 01:20.920
topic and will just walk through them, hopefully addressing various questions and knocking

01:20.960 --> 01:24.240
them out of the park in a fairly efficient manner. There's a lot to discuss, and I don't

01:24.240 --> 01:27.360
know how long this will take, but there are a few things that I want to get out of the

01:27.360 --> 01:31.000
way that I'd normally put at the end, however as it's a special occasion, we'll run with

01:31.000 --> 01:35.240
a special structure. I really want to thank my visual editors, without them I just would

01:35.240 --> 01:39.480
never have the time nor the patience to make these videos, they do such a sensational job,

01:39.480 --> 01:42.600
and if you do have the chance I'm going to leave links in the pinned comments below to

01:42.600 --> 01:46.920
anyone who has edited for me in the last couple months, please go and send them some love.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.960
I also want to thank anyone who has sought out my Patreon and donated, I barely ever

01:50.960 --> 01:54.440
mention it, so the fact that people do actually see the kind of meme at the end of the video

01:54.440 --> 01:59.040
and click on it is kind of impressive, however I do want to take this time out on that to

01:59.040 --> 02:03.520
make an announcement. I am going to be conducting a serious reform of rewards, firstly because

02:03.520 --> 02:07.560
barely anyone claims them, most people just insist they want to donate for the content,

02:07.560 --> 02:11.640
secondly because as always mentioned, most people can attain these rewards without paying

02:11.640 --> 02:15.600
regardless, I do my best to be an open person, and I thought that might come under siege

02:15.640 --> 02:19.280
as I've grown, but I've handled it pretty alright to be honest. Thirdly because of my

02:19.280 --> 02:23.160
current setup it makes it significantly harder to follow through on many of the rewards and

02:23.160 --> 02:27.200
I don't want to make commitments that I can't keep, it's never fun letting people down,

02:27.200 --> 02:31.120
if you've donated before this video then you're still entitled to the rewards committed prior

02:31.120 --> 02:34.840
and will sort something out. They're the only two special announcements that I have to make,

02:34.840 --> 02:38.960
obviously all my mates and YouTube colleagues know how much love I have for them and that

02:38.960 --> 02:43.440
will never change, I'm not going to list them out here but keep hustling boys. Anyhow, with

02:43.440 --> 02:46.600
the pleasantries out the way I want to cut into the crux of this video because there

02:46.600 --> 02:50.720
is a lot to discuss, a lot of things about me to discuss. I had a lot of questions on

02:50.720 --> 02:54.400
my identity, either from people who wanted to know more about me or people who were just

02:54.400 --> 02:58.400
confused that I'd appeared on their timeline. My name is James, I'm a British individual

02:58.400 --> 03:03.160
enrolled in a Dutch university currently studying in America, South Carolina to be exact, though

03:03.160 --> 03:06.720
I do have to return to the Netherlands to complete my degree, I don't know where I'll

03:06.720 --> 03:11.040
go after that, probably to London and then eventually hopefully back to the US. In real

03:11.040 --> 03:15.960
life I dress like most people dress, with clothes, so I do not seek to wear formal attire

03:15.960 --> 03:19.760
in the South Carolina environment, that would be rather foolish, although I have seen a

03:19.760 --> 03:23.800
couple people wearing black blazers and do wonder if they were right. A lot of people

03:23.800 --> 03:28.560
question the legitimacy of my accent, but I promise you it is completely who I am, and

03:28.560 --> 03:32.400
you can ask anyone who's had the pleasure of meeting me in person. People also compare

03:32.400 --> 03:36.760
my accent to Colossal's, we're both from the same general area with a similar upbringing

03:36.760 --> 03:40.640
so it's understandable that we may have a similar accent. To anyone wondering about

03:40.640 --> 03:44.580
how to have this accent themselves, I'm really sorry, I do not know what the specific

03:44.580 --> 03:48.600
settings on the vocal chords are, but if I do find out I'll definitely inform you. A

03:48.600 --> 03:52.200
lot of people also ask me about my persona. I really don't know what made me go with

03:52.200 --> 03:56.240
the style, but eventually it just stuck. It's appropriate for my character because of how

03:56.240 --> 03:59.860
I speak and how I behave when dealing with these topics in an academic manner, which

03:59.860 --> 04:04.360
is definitely something. I deal with YouTube drama not in a dissimilar way in my videos

04:04.360 --> 04:08.760
than I would deal with a spoken dissertation, plus some more jokes and colloquialisms thrown

04:08.760 --> 04:13.140
in there, and in a way that's what I think sets myself apart. Another person asked how

04:13.140 --> 04:17.520
much my persona and my personality are different, and that's where I wanted to precursor this

04:17.520 --> 04:20.760
sentence. When I'm writing out a script, I'm obviously going to be approaching it with

04:20.760 --> 04:24.560
a different attitude than if I dealt with these things spontaneously. There are many

04:24.560 --> 04:27.760
elements and interests pertaining to me that are fairly regular, but I guess I'm just

04:27.760 --> 04:31.920
a more quirky and brooding person, which is what sets me apart in a way. I'm not socially

04:31.920 --> 04:35.900
awkward, though I'm not a fan of large groups of strangers. Some people have asked me about

04:35.900 --> 04:39.460
my music career, as I have said in the past that I am actually a trained singer. I've

04:39.460 --> 04:43.140
also done songwriting and even released a few singles under an alias. The songs didn't

04:43.140 --> 04:47.320
do anything because I didn't have any access to promotional materials, but one day I hope

04:47.320 --> 04:51.280
that I will and I will be able to pursue a career in it. I love music, that's the one

04:51.280 --> 04:54.500
thing that I can never have too much of. I can't think of too many other things to

04:54.500 --> 04:58.660
say about myself apart from an elephant in the room that will be receiving its own part

04:58.660 --> 05:00.340
once I've dealt with another hot topic.

05:06.900 --> 05:12.620
Let me make one thing clear, this is my first proper channel. I have not had any projects

05:12.620 --> 05:17.060
prior to this one. I used to make political content, I think most people know that. I

05:17.060 --> 05:21.380
still integrate levels of political logic into my videos, but I do not comment on specific

05:21.380 --> 05:25.700
political events often, unless I really do have a strong feeling. There are many reasons

05:25.700 --> 05:29.540
to that, and given that some people were here while I was still covering those topics, I

05:29.540 --> 05:34.820
thought I'd explain. Politically, I'm left-wing. I'm not really left-wing, but I'm left-wing.

05:34.820 --> 05:39.260
Now, that has been the case for years, since the inception of my YouTube channel, and when

05:39.260 --> 05:43.760
I first started up, my channel bashed a lot of politicians of the British Conservative

05:43.760 --> 05:48.340
Party, and dealt with issues that were extremely niche in a way. Now, I've gone to three

05:48.340 --> 05:52.140
universities, I won't say too much else, but the first university was not good, and

05:52.140 --> 05:56.060
there were a fair few people who were the sort of stereotype that you see in the sort

05:56.060 --> 06:00.020
of cringe compilations that were the rage on YouTuber, I had a situation where I received

06:00.020 --> 06:05.020
verbal abuse. It's the sort of thing where you just react, you see these people who are

06:05.020 --> 06:09.740
such a piss-take of everything that you want to stand for, and you see them running things

06:09.740 --> 06:14.860
that you even might believe in, into the ground, and it pissed me off. I made a set of videos

06:14.860 --> 06:19.540
based off that reaction, and so to the people who asked me if there was a specific video

06:19.540 --> 06:23.820
I regret or dislike the most, no, but there are videos that I certainly don't feel the

06:23.820 --> 06:28.020
same way about now, and were made on a whim of emotions, feelings that felt justified

06:28.020 --> 06:31.780
at the time, but really could have used a second voice to ask me if I really wanted

06:31.780 --> 06:35.660
to upload that content. How helpful is that to the conversation? If you want to watch

06:35.660 --> 06:39.980
my old videos, then be my guest. At the end of the day, arguments don't have an identity,

06:39.980 --> 06:43.580
but if you want to know if I still endorse those beliefs, it might be best to speak to

06:43.580 --> 06:48.060
me personally. I left political content for a load of reasons, partly because I wanted

06:48.060 --> 06:52.820
some more time to find myself on the political spectrum, a lot of my views are still evolving,

06:52.820 --> 06:57.300
and I definitely took the plunge very early originally. Political YouTube was also going

06:57.300 --> 07:02.100
in a direction that seemed very questionable, you were either with them, or against them.

07:02.100 --> 07:06.240
I'd started to grow tired of the rhetoric employed by a lot of creators, and it began

07:06.240 --> 07:11.240
to show. After a run-in with fanboys over Tom McDonald's White Boy, a song that I still

07:11.240 --> 07:15.740
personally think is really bad, I decided that I needed to re-evaluate what I wanted

07:15.740 --> 07:19.500
to do with my channel. Generally, I don't like to say that someone is bad from their

07:19.500 --> 07:23.980
opinion, I want to make content that I can have fun doing, I just didn't receive that

07:23.980 --> 07:28.460
pleasure from continuing down the route I was taking. It was toxic, it was very toxic,

07:28.460 --> 07:32.100
that won't mean I won't address the political things in the future, but they won't be

07:32.100 --> 07:36.400
the centre of the video. I want to be the best I can be, and I think that results from

07:36.400 --> 07:40.420
a level of information, and I don't think anyone's really nailed it yet, even though

07:40.420 --> 07:44.140
there are some creators that I do respect in what they're doing, there is none that

07:44.140 --> 07:48.000
I do not find fault with. On top of this, there are a lot of reactionaries, and people

07:48.000 --> 07:51.820
with pre-aligned agendas, I look forward to the day when we can all tackle topics with

07:51.820 --> 07:56.020
a bit more nuance. With the current topics that I'm choosing, I will very rarely avoid

07:56.020 --> 07:59.740
something just because I believe it's too controversial, and that's my ethos, I decide

07:59.740 --> 08:05.140
to take things on, on my interest and my confidence in handling it. Controversy doesn't really

08:05.140 --> 08:09.240
factor in, if there's a controversial incident that I think I can handle well, then I'll

08:09.240 --> 08:13.460
do it. With regards to my best video, it is a hard one, because I feel that all of my

08:13.460 --> 08:17.160
newest videos are a step up from my old ones. I'd probably lean towards the animators

08:17.160 --> 08:22.500
video with regards to presentation, maybe Lil Tay with the level of information that

08:22.500 --> 08:26.960
was revealed, but it's difficult, I'll admit that. Really, I only plan to grow my content

08:26.960 --> 08:30.740
and keep working on the imperfections, which there are. I'm very comfortable with certain

08:30.740 --> 08:34.760
elements, but I definitely look forward to a time when I have more opportunity to research

08:34.760 --> 08:39.160
and be involved in the process, because at that point, you won't be able to save the

08:39.160 --> 08:43.600
subjects of my videos. And I'm in my last year of uni, so a lot longer to go now my

08:43.600 --> 08:48.900
friends. I'm hoping that by this time next year, we'll have opportunities all round really.

08:48.900 --> 08:52.700
With regards to the lengths of my videos and whether I'll return to making shorter videos,

08:52.700 --> 08:56.500
I feel that the problem with my shorter videos was that they just didn't carry an impact,

08:56.500 --> 09:00.340
they didn't possess the same weight that my longer videos do. My longer videos just allow

09:00.340 --> 09:05.520
me to do more, to create a convincing environment, or allow me to make a piece reflective, or

09:05.520 --> 09:09.560
whatever. I want people to have a reason to watch my videos, I feel that was lacking in

09:10.560 --> 09:15.420
A lot of people also asked me what inspired me to originally create content, and honestly,

09:15.420 --> 09:19.360
although I was vaguely familiar with many YouTubers who I did greatly enjoy, the main

09:19.360 --> 09:24.140
reason was boredom. I was still coming from a pretty emotionally dark place of January

09:24.140 --> 09:28.440
2016, and one of my friends had a channel where he made gaming content, and I thought

09:28.440 --> 09:32.240
that I might be able to do something with that, and I thought, well, maybe he can give

09:32.240 --> 09:36.820
me some advice. I knew that I had some talent with regards to creating scripts and such,

09:36.820 --> 09:40.980
I just wasn't technically quite there. However, at the time, Vanilla Rice, a friend

09:40.980 --> 09:44.960
of mine who I'll also link in the description below, offered to help me with editing free

09:44.960 --> 09:49.340
of charge, so I guess I should thank him, because without him, the channel would never

09:49.340 --> 09:53.500
have left the ground in the first place. He's really important to my life, and I don't

09:53.500 --> 09:57.660
think I can ever deny that. It was probably also a part investment, as he assumed if I

09:57.660 --> 10:02.300
blew up, I'd help him out too, and he's right about that. We'll definitely collaborate

10:02.300 --> 10:07.500
again soon. I want to do something more with my life, I wanted to go to a market that wasn't

10:07.500 --> 10:11.780
impossible to access and inspire me, YouTube did that, and I hope it doesn't go away

10:11.780 --> 10:16.620
too soon, because I love it, and I love everyone who's supported me through it. But what

10:16.620 --> 10:21.460
about the future? Will I ever return to politics? Will I move towards other content? I don't

10:21.460 --> 10:26.380
know if I'll ever return to hardcore politics, even if the landscape significantly changes,

10:26.380 --> 10:31.020
mainly because if I want to make my political change in the world, which I do actually care

10:31.020 --> 10:35.540
about, I think it'll be beyond YouTube. With regards to music, and film, and so on,

10:35.540 --> 10:39.740
yes, I will almost definitely move towards that, and I was speaking to some other popular

10:39.740 --> 10:44.400
film channels about a possible collaboration project, but I want to think of a proper spicy

10:44.400 --> 10:48.940
take before I move in on it. I love music, and it's also very possible I'll return

10:48.940 --> 10:53.540
to that, I almost did recently, but just didn't quite feel happy with the material. When it

10:53.540 --> 10:58.300
comes to my career goals, if my YouTube failed tomorrow, then my life would go on. I'm

10:58.300 --> 11:03.220
working hard beyond to try and make sure that I can support myself whatever the circumstances,

11:03.220 --> 11:07.940
because YouTube is very unpredictable. My ideal scenario is that this all takes off,

11:07.940 --> 11:11.620
and in five years time, I'm living in the commentary equivalent of FaZe House with the

11:11.620 --> 11:16.100
boys. But life is strange, and sometimes things don't turn out that way. At the end of the

11:16.100 --> 11:20.860
day, I'm making content that firstly I care about, and secondly my audience cares about.

11:20.860 --> 11:24.860
I do my best to strike the balance, because I don't know how long this will last, but

11:24.860 --> 11:29.820
I'm glad I've had the opportunity. I really do hope I reach 100k. When people ask me how

11:29.820 --> 11:34.880
I stay motivated in these scenarios, my reply is really, I just think about how good the

11:34.880 --> 11:39.980
finished product will be. I never want to miss an opportunity, and even though it might

11:39.980 --> 11:44.740
not feel like high stakes at the time, you don't know what you may be passing up on.

11:44.740 --> 11:50.620
Another big question I receive about my channel is my name. Why the right opinion? I genuinely

11:50.620 --> 11:55.580
can't remember the backstory behind it. I think it was a fairly spontaneous decision,

11:55.580 --> 11:59.760
and it's not something that was given too much thought at the time. Honestly, I'm really

11:59.760 --> 12:04.040
bad with names typically, and so the fact that it just popped into my head, I've never

12:04.040 --> 12:08.020
had a second thought about it. You know, you just gotta take all you can get in those positions.

12:08.020 --> 12:12.060
It is of course ironic, and when people are tapping me over it, it is quite amusing. As

12:12.060 --> 12:17.020
for my opinions on other content, I do like to take the idea that content is generally

12:17.020 --> 12:22.000
quite subjective, however, there is definitely a warring level of low-effort culture, clickbait

12:22.000 --> 12:26.900
over content, and really, I do not care about clickbait too much if your content is worth

12:26.900 --> 12:31.620
the click, but you see some people whose videos are completely coasting on the thumbnails

12:31.620 --> 12:35.700
and the titles, and it's rather sad. Do not fear though, I'll make sure everyone gets

12:35.700 --> 12:39.700
their just desserts. With regards to what I watch, I don't really have many channels

12:39.700 --> 12:44.260
that I consider guilty pleasures. As said before, I watch a lot of review channels.

12:44.300 --> 12:48.640
Typically, my go-to channel at the moment is I Hate Everything. On top of this, I also

12:48.640 --> 12:52.940
watch a lot of my friends' channels because I want to support their content. Currently,

12:52.940 --> 12:56.200
university is really pushing time against me, and therefore I do not have the time to

12:56.200 --> 13:00.560
watch content that I do not consider necessary to my life, and I have to watch videos for

13:00.560 --> 13:04.700
research purposes anyway. I have enough to sort out. With regards to my favourite content

13:04.700 --> 13:09.600
creators, Colossal is crazy when he uploads, and Nerd City are definitely up there, especially

13:09.600 --> 13:13.680
with the level of detail that they tend to go into. With regards to smaller creators,

13:13.680 --> 13:18.120
my favourite channel under 1,000 subs is Average Pixel. Trouble is, he's suffering

13:18.120 --> 13:22.680
from a bout of Colossal Syndrome. I'm trying to encourage him to have another video out,

13:22.680 --> 13:27.640
but I think the lack of reception has previously made him slightly cautious, but he is a fantastic

13:27.640 --> 13:32.040
guy, and if any of you can go and show him some love, it might just motivate him. I'll

13:32.040 --> 13:35.800
leave his links in the pinned comment below. And yes, it is true, I have scrapped many

13:35.800 --> 13:40.040
many videos in my time, either because I didn't think I was ready to tackle it yet, or I was

13:40.040 --> 13:43.880
mildly worried at the time whether I'd thought it through. But recently, that concern

13:43.880 --> 13:48.160
has gone to the wind, and I've realised that sometimes you just gotta run with it.

13:48.160 --> 13:52.600
But I'd say I've scrapped around 20 videos in my time, and as mentioned earlier, I have

13:52.600 --> 13:56.760
10 videos lined up, and probably more when I think about it. The only other question

13:56.760 --> 14:01.920
I think I received on this topic was about when I thought I'd stop growing, and honestly,

14:01.920 --> 14:06.780
you want my honest opinion? When I first started up this channel, I thought I'd stop at 3,000,

14:06.780 --> 14:10.960
so the fact that we made it to 50 is something else, really. I think that sums up questions

14:10.960 --> 14:17.380
about my content, so now we have to address one of the most popular types of question.

14:17.380 --> 14:22.040
I'm an open person. I'm open about my struggles, my hardships, and things that other people

14:22.040 --> 14:26.660
may not be so forward about. There are obviously things that are off limits, but I still think

14:26.660 --> 14:31.140
if I'm open about these topics, it might help others. That's important. I'd say around

14:31.140 --> 14:36.180
maybe 30% of my fans know this, maybe more, but yes, I am gay. I don't feel the need to

14:36.180 --> 14:40.340
make a coming out video, because I'm already out pretty publicly, and at the end of the

14:40.340 --> 14:45.260
day, it doesn't factor into my content usually. I am who I am. If it's ever necessary to

14:45.260 --> 14:49.740
bring up as a point of interest, then I shout, but I've seldom encountered the topics.

14:49.740 --> 14:54.380
I really began coming to terms with it when I was 18, so I'm a bit behind in many ways.

14:54.380 --> 14:58.780
It was weird, because I was constantly used to environments where it was never really

14:58.780 --> 15:04.480
considered a possibility. I was just waiting to be attracted to females, and it never happened,

15:04.480 --> 15:08.400
which is something that does still affect me to this day. I think if I had been able

15:08.400 --> 15:13.940
to acknowledge it, at least as a possibility earlier, it may have been easier growing into.

15:13.940 --> 15:18.340
As a person, I'm slightly fragile in that area, and I'm still trying to work myself out.

15:18.340 --> 15:22.520
A lot of people used to ask, so I put it in my Twitter bio. However, since I put it in

15:22.520 --> 15:26.720
my Twitter bio, a lot of people seem to think it's an ironic joke, probably referring to

15:26.720 --> 15:34.760
the other meaning of gay. And yes, I understand that, but I am homosexual. Got it? Good.

15:34.760 --> 15:39.300
Some people have asked me how gay I behave outside of my videos. I guess when they refer

15:39.300 --> 15:45.120
to gay, they are talking about these stereotypes, and the sort of flamboyant, very camp behaviours.

15:45.120 --> 15:49.840
And I am definitely by no means masculine, I do have a bit of an exuberant personality

15:49.840 --> 15:54.840
when I choose to, but I'd say my brand is probably more subdued, so on a gay scale of

15:54.840 --> 15:59.520
1-10, I'd say typically around a 4, with the mild acknowledgement that it may have

15:59.520 --> 16:04.400
a tendency to increase in situations in which I'm excited. I might make the occasional

16:04.400 --> 16:08.880
self-referential joke about it, and that's fine, I make jokes, I'm someone who enjoys

16:08.880 --> 16:13.280
a bit of banter, I think it actually makes me more comfortable with who I am, but I will

16:13.280 --> 16:18.760
not overdo it. Also I received this very interesting question which was put forward, why do I wear

16:18.760 --> 16:23.040
a coat, which is in reference to the time I went to Insomnia gaming festival, and was

16:23.040 --> 16:28.520
only seen in a coat at all times. Firstly, at Insomnia, every night I did not have a

16:28.520 --> 16:32.880
good sleep, and when I'm sleep deprived, I typically feel colder. And secondly, one

16:32.880 --> 16:37.560
of the more unstable things about me is my weight, it has a tendency to increase and

16:37.560 --> 16:41.520
decrease, and honestly, I don't think I've been happy with it for a while. It's funny

16:41.520 --> 16:45.640
because I know that it's far from bad or anything, but the coat just makes me more

16:45.640 --> 16:50.400
comfortable in such environments. This might cause you to hypothesise, it's why I hide

16:50.400 --> 16:54.760
myself from the camera. Although partly true, I'm still unaware of how to balance face

16:54.760 --> 17:00.480
cam with non-face cam, whereas face cam works in a more casual environment with less structure,

17:00.480 --> 17:04.360
scripted content kinda contradicts that, and it's hard to do that with the camera. I

17:04.360 --> 17:09.820
don't always wear a coat, and in fact, in VidCon 2018, I had no other option but to

17:09.820 --> 17:16.280
brace the Californian heat, and I hated every single photo of me. It seems so easy to identify

17:16.280 --> 17:19.940
the little things that you want to correct about yourself. As I said, I have one more

17:19.980 --> 17:24.760
year in university, and then I expect to have more of an opportunity to get into shape.

17:24.760 --> 17:28.820
It does not help that university and YouTube both pile a fair amount of stress onto me

17:28.820 --> 17:32.980
that I don't really have time to stay in great form, but that time will come afterwards,

17:32.980 --> 17:37.740
I have plans to sort it all out and finish it all this coming summer, and then I won't

17:37.740 --> 17:41.320
have to think about it again, but if you do see me before then, just know that I will

17:41.320 --> 17:45.300
have everything under control one day. If I was to see my younger self, I don't know

17:45.300 --> 17:50.220
if I'd give him any advice, mainly because in spite of his numerous flaws, errors, and

17:50.220 --> 17:54.460
every single imperfection that he hated about himself, the desperate longing for socialist

17:54.460 --> 17:59.380
acceptance mixed with a whirlwind of volatile sentiments, he turned into this person, which

17:59.380 --> 18:03.960
once again, is still a work in progress, but is pretty unique in many ways, and is still

18:03.960 --> 18:08.540
striving to be better. Sometimes, those things are so fragile that you wouldn't want to

18:08.540 --> 18:13.460
intervene with a younger version of you because you don't know what you might change, and

18:13.460 --> 18:17.840
even if you give good advice, it may not go the way you want it to. I think the best

18:17.840 --> 18:22.100
advice I'd always give to my younger self is that it's important to put the moments

18:22.100 --> 18:26.380
of childhood into perspective, and although it was a fairly turbulent time and plagued

18:26.380 --> 18:30.980
with a lot of problems, that you'll emerge as a stronger person from it, because you

18:30.980 --> 18:35.980
have to believe you can do better. With regards to advice to a more recent version of myself,

18:35.980 --> 18:41.300
notably a version of me with less subscribers, I'd just tell him to always keep on working

18:41.300 --> 18:46.240
on improving, and to keep working on perfecting it. That's a philosophy that I always keep

18:46.240 --> 18:50.320
up, stay on that grind my friends, stay on that grind.

18:50.320 --> 18:55.900
And the last question I wanted to get out about this personal moment was my most controversial

18:55.900 --> 18:59.920
opinion. We all have them, it's okay, you're allowed to have controversial opinions. My

18:59.920 --> 19:05.680
one is probably about the European Union, given context. As a left-wing student living

19:05.680 --> 19:10.500
in the international world, it seems stereotypical for many to assume that I'd love the European

19:10.500 --> 19:14.140
project. But out of all my opinions that have changed over the years, the one that

19:14.140 --> 19:19.160
has remained steadfast is that the European Union are not to be trusted, and if we outsource

19:19.160 --> 19:24.300
sovereignty to them, it will make it much easier for corporations to influence how laws

19:24.300 --> 19:29.720
are made that affect our lives, and our influence as civilians will be further diluted. I could

19:29.720 --> 19:34.620
go on forever about how much I do to test the European Union. Does it mean I enjoy Brexit?

19:34.620 --> 19:38.760
No, far from it, but it's such a catch-22, it's one of the things that I've never really

19:38.760 --> 19:43.040
budged on, and have convinced a few people on it too. I think that's the personal questions

19:43.040 --> 19:46.660
done about me. Once again, if you have anything else you want to throw in my way, then I'm

19:46.660 --> 19:50.060
always open. Let's talk about the questions that were harder to categorise.

19:52.700 --> 19:57.480
I do have a lot of questions about my relationship with editors, how I've accumulated so many

19:57.480 --> 20:01.320
why I appear to have such a sound working relationship with them. There are a lot of

20:01.320 --> 20:06.200
responses that I can make to this, but the first thing is none of my editors are just

20:06.200 --> 20:10.880
random strangers, a high majority of my editors have approached me, and the few that I approached

20:10.880 --> 20:14.620
were either people who followed me and I'd heard good things about, or mutual friends

20:14.620 --> 20:19.600
already. This immediately elevates the alliance, I love all of them really, they're all really

20:19.600 --> 20:24.380
sound people, which is why I always try and push them out there without bothering my audience

20:24.380 --> 20:30.280
too much. For so many creators it seems almost taboo to give credit to your videos to anyone

20:30.280 --> 20:34.800
else, but I want to let people know that this is not just me, this is a great collaboration

20:34.800 --> 20:40.200
of fantastic people, it's such a mutual energy, and if they're good content creators

20:40.200 --> 20:44.860
then I might even offer them parts in my videos in the future. I try and make their experience

20:44.860 --> 20:49.400
editing my videos enjoyable ones, I try and organise it well at the end of the day, some

20:49.400 --> 20:53.280
of them might see this as an investment because although I can't throw copious amounts of

20:53.280 --> 20:56.780
money at them right now, they might see me as the sort of person who'll pay them back

20:56.780 --> 21:02.500
if I make it, and once again, they're kinda right on that. I am someone who wants to help

21:02.500 --> 21:06.860
out those who've looked out for me, because if you're rich and successful, a lot of fair

21:06.860 --> 21:11.380
weather friends tend to materialise. These people have been here from the start, they

21:11.380 --> 21:15.180
had faith in me when I didn't have faith in myself. You don't want to reach the top

21:15.180 --> 21:19.520
and start searching for friends, that's never a good philosophy, so these lads will

21:19.520 --> 21:24.420
always get enough of the true love.

21:24.420 --> 21:28.280
I wanted to address some of the more slightly spontaneous questions here, ones that just

21:28.280 --> 21:32.240
came out of nowhere, and topics that were a bit more casual and lacking specificity

21:32.240 --> 21:37.640
to me exactly. With regards to music, my favourite artist is Elton John, up there is Queen,

21:37.640 --> 21:42.440
the Electric Light Orchestra, and Robbie Williams. It's an interesting combination of musicians

21:42.440 --> 21:46.440
I'm aware, but my music taste is extremely eclectic, and as I'm writing this script

21:46.440 --> 21:50.280
currently, it just transitioned from Miss Right by Anderson Park to We Built This City

21:50.280 --> 21:55.120
by Starship. Any music that can invoke an emotion from me, which isn't discussed of

21:55.120 --> 21:59.680
course, normally receives a thumbs up, even if it's cheesy and goofy at points. With

21:59.680 --> 22:05.400
regards to films, my favourite film if you haven't worked it out already is Hot Fuzz,

22:05.400 --> 22:10.060
and I make numerous subtle and not-so-subtle references in my videos alluding to it. I

22:10.060 --> 22:14.940
think it's a brilliant film, and nothing can ever touch it, like, it just spoils me

22:14.940 --> 22:19.280
with how wonderful it is. A lot of films don't have rewatch value to me, so any film that

22:19.280 --> 22:24.020
can do that as a first is already a cut above the rest, and boy, I've watched that damn

22:24.020 --> 22:28.420
masterpiece so many times, and will regularly show my friends just to see their reaction.

22:28.420 --> 22:32.660
I also received questions about whether I'm interested in anime. Unfortunately, I haven't

22:32.660 --> 22:37.120
had the time to invest myself in the particular genre too much, but it is the sort of thing

22:37.120 --> 22:41.240
that I could see myself enjoying. I've watched a couple of anime films, and they are just

22:41.240 --> 22:46.900
beautiful, like unbelievable art. I do really think it's kinda magical. With regards to

22:46.900 --> 22:51.480
video games, I'm a sucker for GTA V. I played that game for so much time when I was younger,

22:51.480 --> 22:55.420
I missed the times when I didn't have to worry about an exam every two weeks, and actually

22:55.420 --> 23:00.300
could use the leisure time to sit back and crack out a game like GTA V. It was just so

23:00.300 --> 23:05.280
cathartic. I made a ton of money, bought a ton of weaponry, vehicles, everything. If

23:05.280 --> 23:09.880
it was available at the time, I bought it. It was a game that invested my ambition into

23:09.880 --> 23:14.900
a new energy. It was just so immensely fun. I didn't play many other games, admittedly,

23:14.900 --> 23:18.560
so if I haven't responded to your specific questions about video games, then that's

23:18.560 --> 23:22.840
probably why. I haven't played it. I also played the Call of Duty series, and a bit

23:22.840 --> 23:27.920
of Fortnite, but honestly, I'm mainly anticipating the Call of Duty Royale. I can never really

23:27.920 --> 23:32.160
acclimatise to the building on Fortnite, so I'm looking forward to having the controller

23:32.160 --> 23:37.400
at the helm, and a more classic style. Someone also asked my opinion on furries, and to be

23:37.400 --> 23:42.580
honest, I have noticed that I do have a fairly prominent furry fanbase. I don't mind. At

23:42.580 --> 23:46.620
the end of the day, we're all individuals, I do not care if you're a furry or not,

23:46.620 --> 23:50.120
as long as you're a lovely person, and I know people who are furries who are really

23:50.120 --> 23:54.940
friendly to me. The person who made my channel banner is a furry, so I don't really care

23:54.940 --> 23:59.180
what you do with the anthropomorphic personas. The fursuits though, they do intimidate me

23:59.180 --> 24:04.120
a bit, like for real, like look at those eyes. It's like they're staring into my soul.

24:04.120 --> 24:08.440
Another person also asked how I respond to people when they ask me how much I earn. I

24:08.440 --> 24:12.380
tend to throw out a vague amount of money for the month with a precondition that it

24:12.380 --> 24:16.680
does vary, depending on my upload schedule, and also depending on how well the videos

24:16.680 --> 24:21.880
do. Some videos also have better CPM than others, sometimes YouTube loves me, sometimes

24:21.880 --> 24:26.920
YouTube hates me. Someone who I really have to answer to also asked what my top 5 Taylor

24:26.920 --> 24:31.360
Swift songs are, and I'd say Wildest Dreams, Begin Again, Call It What You Want, Style,

24:31.360 --> 24:36.480
and Getaway Car. I admit, I actually don't mind country music, but I'm not really crazy

24:36.480 --> 24:41.200
about Taylor Swift's country phase, I think it's just aged rather badly on me. Also, I

24:41.200 --> 24:46.020
like bananas, I like beans, and I certainly do not like fucking pineapple on pizza, and

24:46.020 --> 24:49.020
do not ask me about that shit again. Good night.

24:49.020 --> 25:08.440
This was PRPLPRNCH, and I'm out!
