0	12120	Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
12120	17600	too much free time, and 50,000, a fantastic feat, and to be honest, I was going to continue
17600	21840	on my normal schedule, I'm a guy with plenty of ideas, and I already have 10 other video
21840	25400	ideas written down, how am I going to get to them if I waste time with these sorts of
25400	30000	ceremonials? Well, honestly, I think I just need a break. In case you didn't know, I'm
30000	34180	a student of Politics, Philosophy, and International Law with a minor in Psychology, and those
34180	38560	courses definitely take their toll, especially when you're bashing out a ten page script
38560	42680	every week. It's about time management, and so having a script that I can hopefully handle
42680	46600	more efficiently this week will give me less stress, because a huge part of scripting is
46600	51200	also research and watching through these videos to see what sort of spicy takes we can formulate
51200	56360	on these topics. I have a twitter, and on that twitter I put out a tweet asking for
56360	60720	questions for that video, if you don't have a twitter, I apologise, next time I'll put
60720	64640	it on my community tab as well, so you can all pose questions, though I'm not sure when
64640	68680	I'll do something like this next. The Q&A is going to be done in an interesting way,
68680	72480	as I received over 200 questions, there will be some that I won't be able to respond to,
72480	77200	especially more meme-y ones, however I will be cataloguing the questions into a general
77200	80920	topic and will just walk through them, hopefully addressing various questions and knocking
80960	84240	them out of the park in a fairly efficient manner. There's a lot to discuss, and I don't
84240	87360	know how long this will take, but there are a few things that I want to get out of the
87360	91000	way that I'd normally put at the end, however as it's a special occasion, we'll run with
91000	95240	a special structure. I really want to thank my visual editors, without them I just would
95240	99480	never have the time nor the patience to make these videos, they do such a sensational job,
99480	102600	and if you do have the chance I'm going to leave links in the pinned comments below to
102600	106920	anyone who has edited for me in the last couple months, please go and send them some love.
107000	110960	I also want to thank anyone who has sought out my Patreon and donated, I barely ever
110960	114440	mention it, so the fact that people do actually see the kind of meme at the end of the video
114440	119040	and click on it is kind of impressive, however I do want to take this time out on that to
119040	123520	make an announcement. I am going to be conducting a serious reform of rewards, firstly because
123520	127560	barely anyone claims them, most people just insist they want to donate for the content,
127560	131640	secondly because as always mentioned, most people can attain these rewards without paying
131640	135600	regardless, I do my best to be an open person, and I thought that might come under siege
135640	139280	as I've grown, but I've handled it pretty alright to be honest. Thirdly because of my
139280	143160	current setup it makes it significantly harder to follow through on many of the rewards and
143160	147200	I don't want to make commitments that I can't keep, it's never fun letting people down,
147200	151120	if you've donated before this video then you're still entitled to the rewards committed prior
151120	154840	and will sort something out. They're the only two special announcements that I have to make,
154840	158960	obviously all my mates and YouTube colleagues know how much love I have for them and that
158960	163440	will never change, I'm not going to list them out here but keep hustling boys. Anyhow, with
163440	166600	the pleasantries out the way I want to cut into the crux of this video because there
166600	170720	is a lot to discuss, a lot of things about me to discuss. I had a lot of questions on
170720	174400	my identity, either from people who wanted to know more about me or people who were just
174400	178400	confused that I'd appeared on their timeline. My name is James, I'm a British individual
178400	183160	enrolled in a Dutch university currently studying in America, South Carolina to be exact, though
183160	186720	I do have to return to the Netherlands to complete my degree, I don't know where I'll
186720	191040	go after that, probably to London and then eventually hopefully back to the US. In real
191040	195960	life I dress like most people dress, with clothes, so I do not seek to wear formal attire
195960	199760	in the South Carolina environment, that would be rather foolish, although I have seen a
199760	203800	couple people wearing black blazers and do wonder if they were right. A lot of people
203800	208560	question the legitimacy of my accent, but I promise you it is completely who I am, and
208560	212400	you can ask anyone who's had the pleasure of meeting me in person. People also compare
212400	216760	my accent to Colossal's, we're both from the same general area with a similar upbringing
216760	220640	so it's understandable that we may have a similar accent. To anyone wondering about
220640	224580	how to have this accent themselves, I'm really sorry, I do not know what the specific
224580	228600	settings on the vocal chords are, but if I do find out I'll definitely inform you. A
228600	232200	lot of people also ask me about my persona. I really don't know what made me go with
232200	236240	the style, but eventually it just stuck. It's appropriate for my character because of how
236240	239860	I speak and how I behave when dealing with these topics in an academic manner, which
239860	244360	is definitely something. I deal with YouTube drama not in a dissimilar way in my videos
244360	248760	than I would deal with a spoken dissertation, plus some more jokes and colloquialisms thrown
248760	253140	in there, and in a way that's what I think sets myself apart. Another person asked how
253140	257520	much my persona and my personality are different, and that's where I wanted to precursor this
257520	260760	sentence. When I'm writing out a script, I'm obviously going to be approaching it with
260760	264560	a different attitude than if I dealt with these things spontaneously. There are many
264560	267760	elements and interests pertaining to me that are fairly regular, but I guess I'm just
267760	271920	a more quirky and brooding person, which is what sets me apart in a way. I'm not socially
271920	275900	awkward, though I'm not a fan of large groups of strangers. Some people have asked me about
275900	279460	my music career, as I have said in the past that I am actually a trained singer. I've
279460	283140	also done songwriting and even released a few singles under an alias. The songs didn't
283140	287320	do anything because I didn't have any access to promotional materials, but one day I hope
287320	291280	that I will and I will be able to pursue a career in it. I love music, that's the one
291280	294500	thing that I can never have too much of. I can't think of too many other things to
294500	298660	say about myself apart from an elephant in the room that will be receiving its own part
298660	300340	once I've dealt with another hot topic.
306900	312620	Let me make one thing clear, this is my first proper channel. I have not had any projects
312620	317060	prior to this one. I used to make political content, I think most people know that. I
317060	321380	still integrate levels of political logic into my videos, but I do not comment on specific
321380	325700	political events often, unless I really do have a strong feeling. There are many reasons
325700	329540	to that, and given that some people were here while I was still covering those topics, I
329540	334820	thought I'd explain. Politically, I'm left-wing. I'm not really left-wing, but I'm left-wing.
334820	339260	Now, that has been the case for years, since the inception of my YouTube channel, and when
339260	343760	I first started up, my channel bashed a lot of politicians of the British Conservative
343760	348340	Party, and dealt with issues that were extremely niche in a way. Now, I've gone to three
348340	352140	universities, I won't say too much else, but the first university was not good, and
352140	356060	there were a fair few people who were the sort of stereotype that you see in the sort
356060	360020	of cringe compilations that were the rage on YouTuber, I had a situation where I received
360020	365020	verbal abuse. It's the sort of thing where you just react, you see these people who are
365020	369740	such a piss-take of everything that you want to stand for, and you see them running things
369740	374860	that you even might believe in, into the ground, and it pissed me off. I made a set of videos
374860	379540	based off that reaction, and so to the people who asked me if there was a specific video
379540	383820	I regret or dislike the most, no, but there are videos that I certainly don't feel the
383820	388020	same way about now, and were made on a whim of emotions, feelings that felt justified
388020	391780	at the time, but really could have used a second voice to ask me if I really wanted
391780	395660	to upload that content. How helpful is that to the conversation? If you want to watch
395660	399980	my old videos, then be my guest. At the end of the day, arguments don't have an identity,
399980	403580	but if you want to know if I still endorse those beliefs, it might be best to speak to
403580	408060	me personally. I left political content for a load of reasons, partly because I wanted
408060	412820	some more time to find myself on the political spectrum, a lot of my views are still evolving,
412820	417300	and I definitely took the plunge very early originally. Political YouTube was also going
417300	422100	in a direction that seemed very questionable, you were either with them, or against them.
422100	426240	I'd started to grow tired of the rhetoric employed by a lot of creators, and it began
426240	431240	to show. After a run-in with fanboys over Tom McDonald's White Boy, a song that I still
431240	435740	personally think is really bad, I decided that I needed to re-evaluate what I wanted
435740	439500	to do with my channel. Generally, I don't like to say that someone is bad from their
439500	443980	opinion, I want to make content that I can have fun doing, I just didn't receive that
443980	448460	pleasure from continuing down the route I was taking. It was toxic, it was very toxic,
448460	452100	that won't mean I won't address the political things in the future, but they won't be
452100	456400	the centre of the video. I want to be the best I can be, and I think that results from
456400	460420	a level of information, and I don't think anyone's really nailed it yet, even though
460420	464140	there are some creators that I do respect in what they're doing, there is none that
464140	468000	I do not find fault with. On top of this, there are a lot of reactionaries, and people
468000	471820	with pre-aligned agendas, I look forward to the day when we can all tackle topics with
471820	476020	a bit more nuance. With the current topics that I'm choosing, I will very rarely avoid
476020	479740	something just because I believe it's too controversial, and that's my ethos, I decide
479740	485140	to take things on, on my interest and my confidence in handling it. Controversy doesn't really
485140	489240	factor in, if there's a controversial incident that I think I can handle well, then I'll
489240	493460	do it. With regards to my best video, it is a hard one, because I feel that all of my
493460	497160	newest videos are a step up from my old ones. I'd probably lean towards the animators
497160	502500	video with regards to presentation, maybe Lil Tay with the level of information that
502500	506960	was revealed, but it's difficult, I'll admit that. Really, I only plan to grow my content
506960	510740	and keep working on the imperfections, which there are. I'm very comfortable with certain
510740	514760	elements, but I definitely look forward to a time when I have more opportunity to research
514760	519160	and be involved in the process, because at that point, you won't be able to save the
519160	523600	subjects of my videos. And I'm in my last year of uni, so a lot longer to go now my
523600	528900	friends. I'm hoping that by this time next year, we'll have opportunities all round really.
528900	532700	With regards to the lengths of my videos and whether I'll return to making shorter videos,
532700	536500	I feel that the problem with my shorter videos was that they just didn't carry an impact,
536500	540340	they didn't possess the same weight that my longer videos do. My longer videos just allow
540340	545520	me to do more, to create a convincing environment, or allow me to make a piece reflective, or
545520	549560	whatever. I want people to have a reason to watch my videos, I feel that was lacking in
550560	555420	A lot of people also asked me what inspired me to originally create content, and honestly,
555420	559360	although I was vaguely familiar with many YouTubers who I did greatly enjoy, the main
559360	564140	reason was boredom. I was still coming from a pretty emotionally dark place of January
564140	568440	2016, and one of my friends had a channel where he made gaming content, and I thought
568440	572240	that I might be able to do something with that, and I thought, well, maybe he can give
572240	576820	me some advice. I knew that I had some talent with regards to creating scripts and such,
576820	580980	I just wasn't technically quite there. However, at the time, Vanilla Rice, a friend
580980	584960	of mine who I'll also link in the description below, offered to help me with editing free
584960	589340	of charge, so I guess I should thank him, because without him, the channel would never
589340	593500	have left the ground in the first place. He's really important to my life, and I don't
593500	597660	think I can ever deny that. It was probably also a part investment, as he assumed if I
597660	602300	blew up, I'd help him out too, and he's right about that. We'll definitely collaborate
602300	607500	again soon. I want to do something more with my life, I wanted to go to a market that wasn't
607500	611780	impossible to access and inspire me, YouTube did that, and I hope it doesn't go away
611780	616620	too soon, because I love it, and I love everyone who's supported me through it. But what
616620	621460	about the future? Will I ever return to politics? Will I move towards other content? I don't
621460	626380	know if I'll ever return to hardcore politics, even if the landscape significantly changes,
626380	631020	mainly because if I want to make my political change in the world, which I do actually care
631020	635540	about, I think it'll be beyond YouTube. With regards to music, and film, and so on,
635540	639740	yes, I will almost definitely move towards that, and I was speaking to some other popular
639740	644400	film channels about a possible collaboration project, but I want to think of a proper spicy
644400	648940	take before I move in on it. I love music, and it's also very possible I'll return
648940	653540	to that, I almost did recently, but just didn't quite feel happy with the material. When it
653540	658300	comes to my career goals, if my YouTube failed tomorrow, then my life would go on. I'm
658300	663220	working hard beyond to try and make sure that I can support myself whatever the circumstances,
663220	667940	because YouTube is very unpredictable. My ideal scenario is that this all takes off,
667940	671620	and in five years time, I'm living in the commentary equivalent of FaZe House with the
671620	676100	boys. But life is strange, and sometimes things don't turn out that way. At the end of the
676100	680860	day, I'm making content that firstly I care about, and secondly my audience cares about.
680860	684860	I do my best to strike the balance, because I don't know how long this will last, but
684860	689820	I'm glad I've had the opportunity. I really do hope I reach 100k. When people ask me how
689820	694880	I stay motivated in these scenarios, my reply is really, I just think about how good the
694880	699980	finished product will be. I never want to miss an opportunity, and even though it might
699980	704740	not feel like high stakes at the time, you don't know what you may be passing up on.
704740	710620	Another big question I receive about my channel is my name. Why the right opinion? I genuinely
710620	715580	can't remember the backstory behind it. I think it was a fairly spontaneous decision,
715580	719760	and it's not something that was given too much thought at the time. Honestly, I'm really
719760	724040	bad with names typically, and so the fact that it just popped into my head, I've never
724040	728020	had a second thought about it. You know, you just gotta take all you can get in those positions.
728020	732060	It is of course ironic, and when people are tapping me over it, it is quite amusing. As
732060	737020	for my opinions on other content, I do like to take the idea that content is generally
737020	742000	quite subjective, however, there is definitely a warring level of low-effort culture, clickbait
742000	746900	over content, and really, I do not care about clickbait too much if your content is worth
746900	751620	the click, but you see some people whose videos are completely coasting on the thumbnails
751620	755700	and the titles, and it's rather sad. Do not fear though, I'll make sure everyone gets
755700	759700	their just desserts. With regards to what I watch, I don't really have many channels
759700	764260	that I consider guilty pleasures. As said before, I watch a lot of review channels.
764300	768640	Typically, my go-to channel at the moment is I Hate Everything. On top of this, I also
768640	772940	watch a lot of my friends' channels because I want to support their content. Currently,
772940	776200	university is really pushing time against me, and therefore I do not have the time to
776200	780560	watch content that I do not consider necessary to my life, and I have to watch videos for
780560	784700	research purposes anyway. I have enough to sort out. With regards to my favourite content
784700	789600	creators, Colossal is crazy when he uploads, and Nerd City are definitely up there, especially
789600	793680	with the level of detail that they tend to go into. With regards to smaller creators,
793680	798120	my favourite channel under 1,000 subs is Average Pixel. Trouble is, he's suffering
798120	802680	from a bout of Colossal Syndrome. I'm trying to encourage him to have another video out,
802680	807640	but I think the lack of reception has previously made him slightly cautious, but he is a fantastic
807640	812040	guy, and if any of you can go and show him some love, it might just motivate him. I'll
812040	815800	leave his links in the pinned comment below. And yes, it is true, I have scrapped many
815800	820040	many videos in my time, either because I didn't think I was ready to tackle it yet, or I was
820040	823880	mildly worried at the time whether I'd thought it through. But recently, that concern
823880	828160	has gone to the wind, and I've realised that sometimes you just gotta run with it.
828160	832600	But I'd say I've scrapped around 20 videos in my time, and as mentioned earlier, I have
832600	836760	10 videos lined up, and probably more when I think about it. The only other question
836760	841920	I think I received on this topic was about when I thought I'd stop growing, and honestly,
841920	846780	you want my honest opinion? When I first started up this channel, I thought I'd stop at 3,000,
846780	850960	so the fact that we made it to 50 is something else, really. I think that sums up questions
850960	857380	about my content, so now we have to address one of the most popular types of question.
857380	862040	I'm an open person. I'm open about my struggles, my hardships, and things that other people
862040	866660	may not be so forward about. There are obviously things that are off limits, but I still think
866660	871140	if I'm open about these topics, it might help others. That's important. I'd say around
871140	876180	maybe 30% of my fans know this, maybe more, but yes, I am gay. I don't feel the need to
876180	880340	make a coming out video, because I'm already out pretty publicly, and at the end of the
880340	885260	day, it doesn't factor into my content usually. I am who I am. If it's ever necessary to
885260	889740	bring up as a point of interest, then I shout, but I've seldom encountered the topics.
889740	894380	I really began coming to terms with it when I was 18, so I'm a bit behind in many ways.
894380	898780	It was weird, because I was constantly used to environments where it was never really
898780	904480	considered a possibility. I was just waiting to be attracted to females, and it never happened,
904480	908400	which is something that does still affect me to this day. I think if I had been able
908400	913940	to acknowledge it, at least as a possibility earlier, it may have been easier growing into.
913940	918340	As a person, I'm slightly fragile in that area, and I'm still trying to work myself out.
918340	922520	A lot of people used to ask, so I put it in my Twitter bio. However, since I put it in
922520	926720	my Twitter bio, a lot of people seem to think it's an ironic joke, probably referring to
926720	934760	the other meaning of gay. And yes, I understand that, but I am homosexual. Got it? Good.
934760	939300	Some people have asked me how gay I behave outside of my videos. I guess when they refer
939300	945120	to gay, they are talking about these stereotypes, and the sort of flamboyant, very camp behaviours.
945120	949840	And I am definitely by no means masculine, I do have a bit of an exuberant personality
949840	954840	when I choose to, but I'd say my brand is probably more subdued, so on a gay scale of
954840	959520	1-10, I'd say typically around a 4, with the mild acknowledgement that it may have
959520	964400	a tendency to increase in situations in which I'm excited. I might make the occasional
964400	968880	self-referential joke about it, and that's fine, I make jokes, I'm someone who enjoys
968880	973280	a bit of banter, I think it actually makes me more comfortable with who I am, but I will
973280	978760	not overdo it. Also I received this very interesting question which was put forward, why do I wear
978760	983040	a coat, which is in reference to the time I went to Insomnia gaming festival, and was
983040	988520	only seen in a coat at all times. Firstly, at Insomnia, every night I did not have a
988520	992880	good sleep, and when I'm sleep deprived, I typically feel colder. And secondly, one
992880	997560	of the more unstable things about me is my weight, it has a tendency to increase and
997560	1001520	decrease, and honestly, I don't think I've been happy with it for a while. It's funny
1001520	1005640	because I know that it's far from bad or anything, but the coat just makes me more
1005640	1010400	comfortable in such environments. This might cause you to hypothesise, it's why I hide
1010400	1014760	myself from the camera. Although partly true, I'm still unaware of how to balance face
1014760	1020480	cam with non-face cam, whereas face cam works in a more casual environment with less structure,
1020480	1024360	scripted content kinda contradicts that, and it's hard to do that with the camera. I
1024360	1029820	don't always wear a coat, and in fact, in VidCon 2018, I had no other option but to
1029820	1036280	brace the Californian heat, and I hated every single photo of me. It seems so easy to identify
1036280	1039940	the little things that you want to correct about yourself. As I said, I have one more
1039980	1044760	year in university, and then I expect to have more of an opportunity to get into shape.
1044760	1048820	It does not help that university and YouTube both pile a fair amount of stress onto me
1048820	1052980	that I don't really have time to stay in great form, but that time will come afterwards,
1052980	1057740	I have plans to sort it all out and finish it all this coming summer, and then I won't
1057740	1061320	have to think about it again, but if you do see me before then, just know that I will
1061320	1065300	have everything under control one day. If I was to see my younger self, I don't know
1065300	1070220	if I'd give him any advice, mainly because in spite of his numerous flaws, errors, and
1070220	1074460	every single imperfection that he hated about himself, the desperate longing for socialist
1074460	1079380	acceptance mixed with a whirlwind of volatile sentiments, he turned into this person, which
1079380	1083960	once again, is still a work in progress, but is pretty unique in many ways, and is still
1083960	1088540	striving to be better. Sometimes, those things are so fragile that you wouldn't want to
1088540	1093460	intervene with a younger version of you because you don't know what you might change, and
1093460	1097840	even if you give good advice, it may not go the way you want it to. I think the best
1097840	1102100	advice I'd always give to my younger self is that it's important to put the moments
1102100	1106380	of childhood into perspective, and although it was a fairly turbulent time and plagued
1106380	1110980	with a lot of problems, that you'll emerge as a stronger person from it, because you
1110980	1115980	have to believe you can do better. With regards to advice to a more recent version of myself,
1115980	1121300	notably a version of me with less subscribers, I'd just tell him to always keep on working
1121300	1126240	on improving, and to keep working on perfecting it. That's a philosophy that I always keep
1126240	1130320	up, stay on that grind my friends, stay on that grind.
1130320	1135900	And the last question I wanted to get out about this personal moment was my most controversial
1135900	1139920	opinion. We all have them, it's okay, you're allowed to have controversial opinions. My
1139920	1145680	one is probably about the European Union, given context. As a left-wing student living
1145680	1150500	in the international world, it seems stereotypical for many to assume that I'd love the European
1150500	1154140	project. But out of all my opinions that have changed over the years, the one that
1154140	1159160	has remained steadfast is that the European Union are not to be trusted, and if we outsource
1159160	1164300	sovereignty to them, it will make it much easier for corporations to influence how laws
1164300	1169720	are made that affect our lives, and our influence as civilians will be further diluted. I could
1169720	1174620	go on forever about how much I do to test the European Union. Does it mean I enjoy Brexit?
1174620	1178760	No, far from it, but it's such a catch-22, it's one of the things that I've never really
1178760	1183040	budged on, and have convinced a few people on it too. I think that's the personal questions
1183040	1186660	done about me. Once again, if you have anything else you want to throw in my way, then I'm
1186660	1190060	always open. Let's talk about the questions that were harder to categorise.
1192700	1197480	I do have a lot of questions about my relationship with editors, how I've accumulated so many
1197480	1201320	why I appear to have such a sound working relationship with them. There are a lot of
1201320	1206200	responses that I can make to this, but the first thing is none of my editors are just
1206200	1210880	random strangers, a high majority of my editors have approached me, and the few that I approached
1210880	1214620	were either people who followed me and I'd heard good things about, or mutual friends
1214620	1219600	already. This immediately elevates the alliance, I love all of them really, they're all really
1219600	1224380	sound people, which is why I always try and push them out there without bothering my audience
1224380	1230280	too much. For so many creators it seems almost taboo to give credit to your videos to anyone
1230280	1234800	else, but I want to let people know that this is not just me, this is a great collaboration
1234800	1240200	of fantastic people, it's such a mutual energy, and if they're good content creators
1240200	1244860	then I might even offer them parts in my videos in the future. I try and make their experience
1244860	1249400	editing my videos enjoyable ones, I try and organise it well at the end of the day, some
1249400	1253280	of them might see this as an investment because although I can't throw copious amounts of
1253280	1256780	money at them right now, they might see me as the sort of person who'll pay them back
1256780	1262500	if I make it, and once again, they're kinda right on that. I am someone who wants to help
1262500	1266860	out those who've looked out for me, because if you're rich and successful, a lot of fair
1266860	1271380	weather friends tend to materialise. These people have been here from the start, they
1271380	1275180	had faith in me when I didn't have faith in myself. You don't want to reach the top
1275180	1279520	and start searching for friends, that's never a good philosophy, so these lads will
1279520	1284420	always get enough of the true love.
1284420	1288280	I wanted to address some of the more slightly spontaneous questions here, ones that just
1288280	1292240	came out of nowhere, and topics that were a bit more casual and lacking specificity
1292240	1297640	to me exactly. With regards to music, my favourite artist is Elton John, up there is Queen,
1297640	1302440	the Electric Light Orchestra, and Robbie Williams. It's an interesting combination of musicians
1302440	1306440	I'm aware, but my music taste is extremely eclectic, and as I'm writing this script
1306440	1310280	currently, it just transitioned from Miss Right by Anderson Park to We Built This City
1310280	1315120	by Starship. Any music that can invoke an emotion from me, which isn't discussed of
1315120	1319680	course, normally receives a thumbs up, even if it's cheesy and goofy at points. With
1319680	1325400	regards to films, my favourite film if you haven't worked it out already is Hot Fuzz,
1325400	1330060	and I make numerous subtle and not-so-subtle references in my videos alluding to it. I
1330060	1334940	think it's a brilliant film, and nothing can ever touch it, like, it just spoils me
1334940	1339280	with how wonderful it is. A lot of films don't have rewatch value to me, so any film that
1339280	1344020	can do that as a first is already a cut above the rest, and boy, I've watched that damn
1344020	1348420	masterpiece so many times, and will regularly show my friends just to see their reaction.
1348420	1352660	I also received questions about whether I'm interested in anime. Unfortunately, I haven't
1352660	1357120	had the time to invest myself in the particular genre too much, but it is the sort of thing
1357120	1361240	that I could see myself enjoying. I've watched a couple of anime films, and they are just
1361240	1366900	beautiful, like unbelievable art. I do really think it's kinda magical. With regards to
1366900	1371480	video games, I'm a sucker for GTA V. I played that game for so much time when I was younger,
1371480	1375420	I missed the times when I didn't have to worry about an exam every two weeks, and actually
1375420	1380300	could use the leisure time to sit back and crack out a game like GTA V. It was just so
1380300	1385280	cathartic. I made a ton of money, bought a ton of weaponry, vehicles, everything. If
1385280	1389880	it was available at the time, I bought it. It was a game that invested my ambition into
1389880	1394900	a new energy. It was just so immensely fun. I didn't play many other games, admittedly,
1394900	1398560	so if I haven't responded to your specific questions about video games, then that's
1398560	1402840	probably why. I haven't played it. I also played the Call of Duty series, and a bit
1402840	1407920	of Fortnite, but honestly, I'm mainly anticipating the Call of Duty Royale. I can never really
1407920	1412160	acclimatise to the building on Fortnite, so I'm looking forward to having the controller
1412160	1417400	at the helm, and a more classic style. Someone also asked my opinion on furries, and to be
1417400	1422580	honest, I have noticed that I do have a fairly prominent furry fanbase. I don't mind. At
1422580	1426620	the end of the day, we're all individuals, I do not care if you're a furry or not,
1426620	1430120	as long as you're a lovely person, and I know people who are furries who are really
1430120	1434940	friendly to me. The person who made my channel banner is a furry, so I don't really care
1434940	1439180	what you do with the anthropomorphic personas. The fursuits though, they do intimidate me
1439180	1444120	a bit, like for real, like look at those eyes. It's like they're staring into my soul.
1444120	1448440	Another person also asked how I respond to people when they ask me how much I earn. I
1448440	1452380	tend to throw out a vague amount of money for the month with a precondition that it
1452380	1456680	does vary, depending on my upload schedule, and also depending on how well the videos
1456680	1461880	do. Some videos also have better CPM than others, sometimes YouTube loves me, sometimes
1461880	1466920	YouTube hates me. Someone who I really have to answer to also asked what my top 5 Taylor
1466920	1471360	Swift songs are, and I'd say Wildest Dreams, Begin Again, Call It What You Want, Style,
1471360	1476480	and Getaway Car. I admit, I actually don't mind country music, but I'm not really crazy
1476480	1481200	about Taylor Swift's country phase, I think it's just aged rather badly on me. Also, I
1481200	1486020	like bananas, I like beans, and I certainly do not like fucking pineapple on pizza, and
1486020	1489020	do not ask me about that shit again. Good night.
1489020	1508440	This was PRPLPRNCH, and I'm out!
