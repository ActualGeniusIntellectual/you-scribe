00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Let's have a look into the mind of a rather peculiar trend.

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,800
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,800
and we're gonna start with a flashback.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,000
Now, it was a fair time ago that I did a video about trans-abled people.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,800
These were people who claimed that they were disabled people trapped in able-bodied humans.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,400
It was as stupid as it sounded, and with the help of Sergeant Ducky, the man, the myth, the legend,

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,700
any sorts of arguments or points in favor of it were quickly dispatched of,

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,100
and have never reared their ugly head again on my channel.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,100
It was on that video where the comparison between people who claimed to be trans-racial and trans-abled was brought up,

10
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,900
only in passing, but still a justified juxtaposition.

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,900
Both of them shared a theoretical issue with their existence.

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,100
I honestly doubted if I'd ever need to address such tomfoolery further,

13
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:52,100
but here we are, on my channel, back at it again with the videos that are so far that they'll burn down your motherfucking screen.

14
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,700
So back to the topic. I've seen this rather idiotic increase in frequency of people who claim to be black.

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,500
Some of them claim their behavior makes them black, whereas others have just gone full-out blackface.

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,500
It was with two consecutive videos that I saw this disturbing turn towards insanity for the human race.

17
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,500
Two very diverse, but equally dim-witted dingbats.

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,900
So let's have a look at these very special people, then.

19
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:16,700
The first one is Woah Vicky, a very obviously Caucasian female who, believe it or not, claims to be black.

20
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,500
She has a slew of incendiary videos, most notably the one where she basically just insults Asian people,

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,700
but what's more baffling is her claim to her own racial identity.

22
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,900
She justifies this with the fact that her ancestry results claim that she has progenitors from Africa.

23
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,700
Yes, keep that one in mind.

24
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,700
She behaves in a rather raucous manner, basically doing her impression of a juvenile rapper

25
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:42,100
after he notches a hit in the lower half of the Billboard Hot 100, rather than anyone actually black.

26
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,900
But as you can see, she is definitely not black.

27
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:51,500
So for people who do notice that you often need a corroborating skin tone to match the ethnicity that you claim to be a part of, what's the solution?

28
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,900
Well, Martina Big has really outdone herself on this one.

29
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,300
She is a lady who actually altered her body so that she could resemble a black person.

30
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,900
But saying that would be ridiculous, because she doesn't.

31
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,500
She looks like she's stuck two space hoppers underneath her dress and gone skinny-dipping in Nutella.

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,300
She says she can feel herself becoming a black woman and that the transformation is occurring,

33
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,500
and that she's going to Africa to learn the culture.

34
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,700
She claims her interests have changed and evolved, although she doesn't like hip-hop music.

35
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,700
I think these two cases have given me enough to work with, so we're going to proceed with that now.

36
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,500
So, Woah Vicky, you're still predominantly from Europe.

37
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,900
Also, as I said, your idea of African-American culture is on par with Blake Shelton's.

38
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,300
Not everyone is fucking Trinidad James.

39
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:39,100
Also, this idea of black people being these overwrought caricatures of rappers is quite amusing given the grim reality of many rappers' backgrounds.

40
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,300
Woah Vicky loves to adopt the attitude of the most glamorous aspects of many of these individuals,

41
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:50,100
but would go running with her reptilian tail between her legs if she ever had to live in many of the neighbourhoods that many of these famous rappers grew up in.

42
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,500
With regards to Martina Bic, well, number one, you look ridiculous.

43
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:59,500
You'll certainly know Exotic Barbie if that's what you're going for, more of a doll that Sid from Toy Story got his hands on.

44
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,900
She seems to think that her tastes have evolved since surgery, and I highly doubt that.

45
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,300
And even if it has, it'll be the placebo effect.

46
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,300
Most tastes are a combination of genetics and upbringing, not bloody spray-tan surgery.

47
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,300
The reference to her Africa trip is probably the straw that breaks the proverbial camel's back.

48
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,500
It seems that both of these individuals have race and culture conflicted.

49
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,500
You don't have to be a particular race to enjoy something associated with culture.

50
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,300
I imagine Martina just visiting the whole of Africa and just expecting it to be completely homogenous.

51
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,300
Newsflash, there are multiple cultures in Africa alone, and you will never truly understand them.

52
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:38,900
She's also going to have nose surgery, by the way, so she can get a more African-resembling nose, which at this point is just fucking pathetic, sort yourself out.

53
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,100
You know? Do you want me to tell you something about me? I love fried chicken. It's my favorite food.

54
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,500
I love rap music, watermelon, and fucking Kool-Aid.

55
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,500
I love plenty of things that would be stereotypically associated with African and African-American culture.

56
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,700
It doesn't make me fucking black.

57
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,500
Interests are not racially exclusive.

58
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,100
I'm from a place where it is part of culture to drink cider. A lot of people do, but I hate cider.

59
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,700
I fucking loathe cider. I will not touch the thing.

60
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,500
The only alcohol I drink is vodka.

61
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
Does that make me fucking Russian? Does it?

62
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,900
Will I be calling up Vladimir Putin to have a rendezvous?

63
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,500
Do you understand how stupid your logic sounds?

64
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:17,100
No, I don't think you do, and that they will never fully understand what culture means and the racial differentials that exist.

65
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,300
There is nothing you can do while being black that you can't do while being any other race,

66
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,900
nor will identifying as black legitimize your claims to do that regardless,

67
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:33,900
and that's the ultimate factor in why being transracial is just idiotic and rather embarrassing, to be honest.

68
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,900
Imagine that woman from Digital Blackface when she saw this.

69
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,700
I bet she was fuming, but I don't know if she'd know which emojis to choose to react.

70
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,300
Okay, bringing it back to the closing points, racial identity isn't cultural imprinting.

71
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,100
These two people should seek help, and I need a nice warm bath, but they only have showers here.

72
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,300
Sometimes you have to take what you can get.

73
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,700
Martina Big and Woe Vicky. You should know that.

74
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,100
Thoughts in the comments below, always appreciated,

75
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,500
and thank you for being attentive enough to reach my outro once more. Great job.

76
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,700
I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
