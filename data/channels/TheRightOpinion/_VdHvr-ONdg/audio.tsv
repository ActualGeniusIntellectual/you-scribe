0	3200	Let's have a look into the mind of a rather peculiar trend.
9200	12800	Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,
12800	14800	and we're gonna start with a flashback.
14800	18000	Now, it was a fair time ago that I did a video about trans-abled people.
18000	21800	These were people who claimed that they were disabled people trapped in able-bodied humans.
21800	26400	It was as stupid as it sounded, and with the help of Sergeant Ducky, the man, the myth, the legend,
26400	29700	any sorts of arguments or points in favor of it were quickly dispatched of,
29700	32100	and have never reared their ugly head again on my channel.
32100	37100	It was on that video where the comparison between people who claimed to be trans-racial and trans-abled was brought up,
37100	39900	only in passing, but still a justified juxtaposition.
39900	42900	Both of them shared a theoretical issue with their existence.
42900	46100	I honestly doubted if I'd ever need to address such tomfoolery further,
46100	52100	but here we are, on my channel, back at it again with the videos that are so far that they'll burn down your motherfucking screen.
52100	56700	So back to the topic. I've seen this rather idiotic increase in frequency of people who claim to be black.
56700	60500	Some of them claim their behavior makes them black, whereas others have just gone full-out blackface.
60500	65500	It was with two consecutive videos that I saw this disturbing turn towards insanity for the human race.
65500	68500	Two very diverse, but equally dim-witted dingbats.
68500	70900	So let's have a look at these very special people, then.
70900	76700	The first one is Woah Vicky, a very obviously Caucasian female who, believe it or not, claims to be black.
76700	81500	She has a slew of incendiary videos, most notably the one where she basically just insults Asian people,
81500	84700	but what's more baffling is her claim to her own racial identity.
84700	89900	She justifies this with the fact that her ancestry results claim that she has progenitors from Africa.
89900	91700	Yes, keep that one in mind.
91700	96700	She behaves in a rather raucous manner, basically doing her impression of a juvenile rapper
96700	102100	after he notches a hit in the lower half of the Billboard Hot 100, rather than anyone actually black.
102100	104900	But as you can see, she is definitely not black.
104900	111500	So for people who do notice that you often need a corroborating skin tone to match the ethnicity that you claim to be a part of, what's the solution?
111700	114900	Well, Martina Big has really outdone herself on this one.
115900	120300	She is a lady who actually altered her body so that she could resemble a black person.
120300	122900	But saying that would be ridiculous, because she doesn't.
122900	127500	She looks like she's stuck two space hoppers underneath her dress and gone skinny-dipping in Nutella.
127500	131300	She says she can feel herself becoming a black woman and that the transformation is occurring,
131300	133500	and that she's going to Africa to learn the culture.
133500	137700	She claims her interests have changed and evolved, although she doesn't like hip-hop music.
138300	142700	I think these two cases have given me enough to work with, so we're going to proceed with that now.
142700	145500	So, Woah Vicky, you're still predominantly from Europe.
145500	149900	Also, as I said, your idea of African-American culture is on par with Blake Shelton's.
149900	152300	Not everyone is fucking Trinidad James.
152300	159100	Also, this idea of black people being these overwrought caricatures of rappers is quite amusing given the grim reality of many rappers' backgrounds.
159100	163300	Woah Vicky loves to adopt the attitude of the most glamorous aspects of many of these individuals,
163300	170100	but would go running with her reptilian tail between her legs if she ever had to live in many of the neighbourhoods that many of these famous rappers grew up in.
170100	173500	With regards to Martina Bic, well, number one, you look ridiculous.
173500	179500	You'll certainly know Exotic Barbie if that's what you're going for, more of a doll that Sid from Toy Story got his hands on.
179500	183900	She seems to think that her tastes have evolved since surgery, and I highly doubt that.
183900	186300	And even if it has, it'll be the placebo effect.
186300	191300	Most tastes are a combination of genetics and upbringing, not bloody spray-tan surgery.
191300	195300	The reference to her Africa trip is probably the straw that breaks the proverbial camel's back.
195300	198500	It seems that both of these individuals have race and culture conflicted.
198500	202500	You don't have to be a particular race to enjoy something associated with culture.
202500	207300	I imagine Martina just visiting the whole of Africa and just expecting it to be completely homogenous.
207300	212300	Newsflash, there are multiple cultures in Africa alone, and you will never truly understand them.
212300	218900	She's also going to have nose surgery, by the way, so she can get a more African-resembling nose, which at this point is just fucking pathetic, sort yourself out.
218900	222100	You know? Do you want me to tell you something about me? I love fried chicken. It's my favorite food.
222100	224500	I love rap music, watermelon, and fucking Kool-Aid.
224500	229500	I love plenty of things that would be stereotypically associated with African and African-American culture.
229500	231700	It doesn't make me fucking black.
231700	233500	Interests are not racially exclusive.
233500	238100	I'm from a place where it is part of culture to drink cider. A lot of people do, but I hate cider.
238100	240700	I fucking loathe cider. I will not touch the thing.
240700	242500	The only alcohol I drink is vodka.
242500	244500	Does that make me fucking Russian? Does it?
244500	246900	Will I be calling up Vladimir Putin to have a rendezvous?
246900	250500	Do you understand how stupid your logic sounds?
250500	257100	No, I don't think you do, and that they will never fully understand what culture means and the racial differentials that exist.
257100	262300	There is nothing you can do while being black that you can't do while being any other race,
262300	266900	nor will identifying as black legitimize your claims to do that regardless,
266900	273900	and that's the ultimate factor in why being transracial is just idiotic and rather embarrassing, to be honest.
273900	276900	Imagine that woman from Digital Blackface when she saw this.
276900	280700	I bet she was fuming, but I don't know if she'd know which emojis to choose to react.
280700	285300	Okay, bringing it back to the closing points, racial identity isn't cultural imprinting.
285300	290100	These two people should seek help, and I need a nice warm bath, but they only have showers here.
290100	292300	Sometimes you have to take what you can get.
292300	295700	Martina Big and Woe Vicky. You should know that.
295700	298100	Thoughts in the comments below, always appreciated,
298100	302500	and thank you for being attentive enough to reach my outro once more. Great job.
302500	304700	I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
