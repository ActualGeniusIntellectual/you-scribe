00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
I do not like Jeremy Hunt. Not. One. Bit.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:15,700

00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,700
Hello, I'm the Right Opinion and today we talk about Jeremy Hunt, everyone's favourite health minister.

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,700
This is a request from one of my many subscribers.

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:26,300
**

6
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,700
Apologies for the voice, I have a cold.

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,700
**

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,700
Now, Jeremy Hunt is the worst thing to happen to the NHS since MRSA,

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:44,200
and why the hell anyone in their right frame of mind would put him in charge of such an influential workforce is beyond me. Completely.

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,700
Everyone in Britain knows what situation I'm referring to, the junior doctor contracts.

11
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,200
**

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,200
In September 2015, the Department of Health, which is in charge of all that,

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,700
stated that they would pursue a new contract for junior doctors.

14
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:05,700
These new contracts would extend the working hours that doctors would not be paid premium while increasing the pay marginally.

15
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,700
Something that Jeremy Hunt claimed to be completely cost neutral.

16
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,700
Here's the problem. Jeremy Hunt was a lying twat.

17
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,700
Yes, many doctors were about to lose a fair bit of money, some up to 40%,

18
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:24,700
being forced to work more unsociable hours, while Jeremy Hunt and other MPs pocketed a nifty pay rise.

19
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:32,200
Jeremy Hunt also lied about the 11,000 excess deaths on the weekend, when in fact the data collected covered Monday and Friday as well.

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:40,200
He's done all his negotiating through the media, and has relied on icons such as Katie Hopkins and Kelvin McKenzie to try and support him.

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
How?

22
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,200
**

23
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,200
Now, I'm no doctor, and from what I've heard, a lot of the disputes lie in areas that I will never understand.

24
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,700
Safeguarding, patient safety, etc.

25
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,700
What I do understand is that Jeremy Hunt is not qualified to run the NHS.

26
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,700
His approval rating lies at 17%.

27
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,700
17 fucking percent.

28
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,700
Fantastic Four has a better public rating. Fantastic fucking four.

29
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,700
It's probably wasted less money as well.

30
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,700
I'm also of the belief that Jeremy Hunt is not qualified to be in government at all.

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,200
When someone allows their agent to stay at the cost of the taxpayer for approximately Â£10,000,

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:29,200
and then claim it was a mistake, then they are either too incompetent to be in government, or they're lying through their teeth.

33
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,200
Jeremy Hunt is the epitome of why businessmen with vested interests should not be put in charge of areas they have no experience in.

34
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:43,200
He has negotiated with all the grace of a sumo wrestler, and with his overtone of contempt for the people he is supposed to be working with.

35
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,200
The atmosphere is just too toxic, and no matter what Jeremy Hunt did or will do to try and amend it,

36
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,200
he needs to step down and allow someone else to take the helm and restart negotiations.

37
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:02,200
It is the only way they will be able to realise their vision of the supposed seven day NHS, without losing a lot of their workforce.

38
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,200
And a seven day NHS isn't a bad idea.

39
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,700
Everyone wants health to be as good every single day of the week.

40
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,200
But when you have Jeremy Hunt in charge, it just does not work.

41
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
It will never work.

42
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Get someone with a bit of experience, and then everything will sort itself out.

43
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:28,700
So, there you have it. There's my opinion on Jeremy Hunt as unbiased and objective as always.

44
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,200
I'm sure I'm going to upset a few people with this.

45
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,200
Well, anyone who watches, I know.

46
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,200
Not really many people watch me, but you know, fuck it.

47
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
Have a little rant.

48
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,200
For my friends, that's what I do.

49
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,700
This is how we do it.

50
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,200
You enjoyed it, like it, subscribe it.

51
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
Bop it.

52
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Fuck it.

53
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Do it.

54
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
Yeah.

55
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,200
And if you didn't like it, well then, that's cool.

56
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,200
I'm The Right Opinion, and that was the thoughts of a twat with too much free time.

57
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,200
Thank you.

58
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,200
You're welcome.
