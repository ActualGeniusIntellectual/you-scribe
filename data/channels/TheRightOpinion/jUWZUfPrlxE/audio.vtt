00:00.000 --> 00:05.300
I do not like Jeremy Hunt. Not. One. Bit.

00:05.300 --> 00:15.700
**

00:15.700 --> 00:16.700
Hello, I'm the Right Opinion and today we talk about Jeremy Hunt, everyone's favourite health minister.

00:16.700 --> 00:19.700
This is a request from one of my many subscribers.

00:19.700 --> 00:26.300
**

00:26.300 --> 00:28.700
Apologies for the voice, I have a cold.

00:28.700 --> 00:31.700
**

00:31.700 --> 00:36.700
Now, Jeremy Hunt is the worst thing to happen to the NHS since MRSA,

00:36.700 --> 00:44.200
and why the hell anyone in their right frame of mind would put him in charge of such an influential workforce is beyond me. Completely.

00:44.200 --> 00:48.700
Everyone in Britain knows what situation I'm referring to, the junior doctor contracts.

00:48.700 --> 00:50.200
**

00:50.200 --> 00:55.200
In September 2015, the Department of Health, which is in charge of all that,

00:55.200 --> 00:58.700
stated that they would pursue a new contract for junior doctors.

00:58.700 --> 01:05.700
These new contracts would extend the working hours that doctors would not be paid premium while increasing the pay marginally.

01:05.700 --> 01:09.700
Something that Jeremy Hunt claimed to be completely cost neutral.

01:09.700 --> 01:13.700
Here's the problem. Jeremy Hunt was a lying twat.

01:13.700 --> 01:18.700
Yes, many doctors were about to lose a fair bit of money, some up to 40%,

01:18.700 --> 01:24.700
being forced to work more unsociable hours, while Jeremy Hunt and other MPs pocketed a nifty pay rise.

01:24.700 --> 01:32.200
Jeremy Hunt also lied about the 11,000 excess deaths on the weekend, when in fact the data collected covered Monday and Friday as well.

01:32.200 --> 01:40.200
He's done all his negotiating through the media, and has relied on icons such as Katie Hopkins and Kelvin McKenzie to try and support him.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.200
How?

01:41.200 --> 01:43.200
**

01:43.200 --> 01:49.200
Now, I'm no doctor, and from what I've heard, a lot of the disputes lie in areas that I will never understand.

01:49.700 --> 01:51.700
Safeguarding, patient safety, etc.

01:51.700 --> 01:56.700
What I do understand is that Jeremy Hunt is not qualified to run the NHS.

01:56.700 --> 02:00.700
His approval rating lies at 17%.

02:00.700 --> 02:03.700
17 fucking percent.

02:03.700 --> 02:08.700
Fantastic Four has a better public rating. Fantastic fucking four.

02:08.700 --> 02:11.700
It's probably wasted less money as well.

02:11.700 --> 02:15.700
I'm also of the belief that Jeremy Hunt is not qualified to be in government at all.

02:16.200 --> 02:22.200
When someone allows their agent to stay at the cost of the taxpayer for approximately Â£10,000,

02:22.200 --> 02:29.200
and then claim it was a mistake, then they are either too incompetent to be in government, or they're lying through their teeth.

02:29.200 --> 02:36.200
Jeremy Hunt is the epitome of why businessmen with vested interests should not be put in charge of areas they have no experience in.

02:36.200 --> 02:43.200
He has negotiated with all the grace of a sumo wrestler, and with his overtone of contempt for the people he is supposed to be working with.

02:43.200 --> 02:49.200
The atmosphere is just too toxic, and no matter what Jeremy Hunt did or will do to try and amend it,

02:49.200 --> 02:54.200
he needs to step down and allow someone else to take the helm and restart negotiations.

02:54.200 --> 03:02.200
It is the only way they will be able to realise their vision of the supposed seven day NHS, without losing a lot of their workforce.

03:02.200 --> 03:05.200
And a seven day NHS isn't a bad idea.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.700
Everyone wants health to be as good every single day of the week.

03:08.700 --> 03:13.200
But when you have Jeremy Hunt in charge, it just does not work.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.200
It will never work.

03:15.200 --> 03:21.200
Get someone with a bit of experience, and then everything will sort itself out.

03:21.200 --> 03:28.700
So, there you have it. There's my opinion on Jeremy Hunt as unbiased and objective as always.

03:28.700 --> 03:31.200
I'm sure I'm going to upset a few people with this.

03:31.200 --> 03:34.200
Well, anyone who watches, I know.

03:34.200 --> 03:38.200
Not really many people watch me, but you know, fuck it.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.200
Have a little rant.

03:39.200 --> 03:42.200
For my friends, that's what I do.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.700
This is how we do it.

03:44.700 --> 03:48.200
You enjoyed it, like it, subscribe it.

03:48.200 --> 03:49.200
Bop it.

03:49.200 --> 03:50.200
Fuck it.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.200
Do it.

03:51.200 --> 03:52.200
Yeah.

03:52.200 --> 03:55.200
And if you didn't like it, well then, that's cool.

03:55.200 --> 04:00.200
I'm The Right Opinion, and that was the thoughts of a twat with too much free time.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.200
Thank you.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.200
You're welcome.
