0	5300	I do not like Jeremy Hunt. Not. One. Bit.
5300	15700	**
15700	16700	Hello, I'm the Right Opinion and today we talk about Jeremy Hunt, everyone's favourite health minister.
16700	19700	This is a request from one of my many subscribers.
19700	26300	**
26300	28700	Apologies for the voice, I have a cold.
28700	31700	**
31700	36700	Now, Jeremy Hunt is the worst thing to happen to the NHS since MRSA,
36700	44200	and why the hell anyone in their right frame of mind would put him in charge of such an influential workforce is beyond me. Completely.
44200	48700	Everyone in Britain knows what situation I'm referring to, the junior doctor contracts.
48700	50200	**
50200	55200	In September 2015, the Department of Health, which is in charge of all that,
55200	58700	stated that they would pursue a new contract for junior doctors.
58700	65700	These new contracts would extend the working hours that doctors would not be paid premium while increasing the pay marginally.
65700	69700	Something that Jeremy Hunt claimed to be completely cost neutral.
69700	73700	Here's the problem. Jeremy Hunt was a lying twat.
73700	78700	Yes, many doctors were about to lose a fair bit of money, some up to 40%,
78700	84700	being forced to work more unsociable hours, while Jeremy Hunt and other MPs pocketed a nifty pay rise.
84700	92200	Jeremy Hunt also lied about the 11,000 excess deaths on the weekend, when in fact the data collected covered Monday and Friday as well.
92200	100200	He's done all his negotiating through the media, and has relied on icons such as Katie Hopkins and Kelvin McKenzie to try and support him.
100200	101200	How?
101200	103200	**
103200	109200	Now, I'm no doctor, and from what I've heard, a lot of the disputes lie in areas that I will never understand.
109700	111700	Safeguarding, patient safety, etc.
111700	116700	What I do understand is that Jeremy Hunt is not qualified to run the NHS.
116700	120700	His approval rating lies at 17%.
120700	123700	17 fucking percent.
123700	128700	Fantastic Four has a better public rating. Fantastic fucking four.
128700	131700	It's probably wasted less money as well.
131700	135700	I'm also of the belief that Jeremy Hunt is not qualified to be in government at all.
136200	142200	When someone allows their agent to stay at the cost of the taxpayer for approximately Â£10,000,
142200	149200	and then claim it was a mistake, then they are either too incompetent to be in government, or they're lying through their teeth.
149200	156200	Jeremy Hunt is the epitome of why businessmen with vested interests should not be put in charge of areas they have no experience in.
156200	163200	He has negotiated with all the grace of a sumo wrestler, and with his overtone of contempt for the people he is supposed to be working with.
163200	169200	The atmosphere is just too toxic, and no matter what Jeremy Hunt did or will do to try and amend it,
169200	174200	he needs to step down and allow someone else to take the helm and restart negotiations.
174200	182200	It is the only way they will be able to realise their vision of the supposed seven day NHS, without losing a lot of their workforce.
182200	185200	And a seven day NHS isn't a bad idea.
185200	188700	Everyone wants health to be as good every single day of the week.
188700	193200	But when you have Jeremy Hunt in charge, it just does not work.
193200	195200	It will never work.
195200	201200	Get someone with a bit of experience, and then everything will sort itself out.
201200	208700	So, there you have it. There's my opinion on Jeremy Hunt as unbiased and objective as always.
208700	211200	I'm sure I'm going to upset a few people with this.
211200	214200	Well, anyone who watches, I know.
214200	218200	Not really many people watch me, but you know, fuck it.
218200	219200	Have a little rant.
219200	222200	For my friends, that's what I do.
222200	224700	This is how we do it.
224700	228200	You enjoyed it, like it, subscribe it.
228200	229200	Bop it.
229200	230200	Fuck it.
230200	231200	Do it.
231200	232200	Yeah.
232200	235200	And if you didn't like it, well then, that's cool.
235200	240200	I'm The Right Opinion, and that was the thoughts of a twat with too much free time.
240200	241200	Thank you.
248200	250200	You're welcome.
