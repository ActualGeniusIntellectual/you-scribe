0	8200	Mokbang, a community on YouTube built on the consumption of obscene amounts of food for
8200	10320	the entertainment of bewildered onlookers.
10320	15960	This is Nicholas Perry, aka Nikocado Avocado, a rather controversial figure on the platform.
15960	19560	He's been in a few incidents that hit the bigwig's radar upstairs.
19560	21560	Looks like a douchebag.
21560	23560	You're one to talk.
23560	27560	Recon agents have acquired its current location and are holding a perimeter on the Alpha site.
27560	29560	You've been tasked with eliminating the target.
29560	31560	Distraction points have been-
31560	33560	Look, why exactly do we care?
33560	37560	Well, you see, Alpha Strand doesn't even check that we want you to try out in the field.
37560	39560	Hey, dude.
39560	41560	What the f*** is this?
41560	43560	What?
43560	49560	Oh, no, you won't be able to access that video in your current location.
49560	51560	That's stupid.
51560	53560	Mm-hmm.
53560	57560	If we could test out the incendiary plasma grenades on them, that'd be great.
57560	59560	Incendiary pla- How'd those work?
59560	61560	I just told you how they work.
61560	63560	How am I supposed to watch this if it's blocked?
63560	65560	I'm glad you asked.
67560	69560	Well, well, well.
69560	71560	Hey, Tro.
71560	73560	Haven't seen you since Acapulco.
73560	75560	Acapulco?
75560	77560	F***, you told me we go to Acapulco together.
77560	79560	That's our special place. Remember one time we-
79560	81560	Look, man, can we not talk about that?
81560	83560	Of course I'm listening to you.
83560	85560	Listen, don't you guys normally have black hair?
85560	87560	Well, yeah.
87560	89560	That's a surprise you noticed, actually.
89560	91560	Oh, you know I did. What'd you do to it?
91560	93560	Well- I can't see your video, dude.
93560	95560	That's because your location doesn't allow it.
95560	97560	It's garbage.
97560	99560	Just turn on your VPN.
99560	101560	I don't know what that is.
101560	103560	Well, then, I suppose I'll bring you up to speed.
103560	109560	A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, is an online device which allows you to adjust or hide your IP address,
110560	115560	while providing an additional layer of security for your personal data through the process of encryption.
115560	116560	Huh.
116560	121560	So, for example, after this rather stressful mission, you will probably want to unwind by watching a motion picture.
121560	126560	However, you may find the current Netflix repertoire somewhat underwhelming or repetitive.
126560	134560	By using Surfshark VPN, you can relocate to another country, which will offer you a new selection of films to quench your cinephilic designs.
134560	138560	As a twat with too much free time, particularly in this lockdown, I know I've watched a lot recently.
138560	142560	This is all well and good, but I don't watch that many movies, bud.
142560	146560	Plus, the ladies keep me pretty busy, and you know how they are.
146560	147560	One second.
147560	149560	It was pretty scary, but, like-
149560	154560	Oh my god, now how did you get it like that? Like, what's the technique? Like, you know-
154560	156560	Oh yeah, well, what I do is-
157560	163560	Well, what if you were researching one of your targets and a site which you needed access to was blocked?
163560	165560	Go on.
165560	170560	Using Surfshark VPN will allow you to adjust your settings to bypass this barrier.
170560	177560	You can also use their clean web add-on to make sure those malicious sites out there don't pull the old switcheroo on you and compromise your security.
177560	178560	Alright, what's the catch?
178560	180560	No catch, just a deal.
180560	181560	Send it.
181560	188560	Well, the deal is, if you use code OPINION at checkout, you'll receive three months free alongside 85% off a two-year subscription,
188560	193560	giving you over two years of Surfshark for the price of just four months.
193560	194560	Is this an ad read?
194560	199560	Hm. All you have to do is click the link in the description below and select the plan in reference.
199560	202560	They even offer a 30-day money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied.
202560	205560	So there's really, truly, no risk at all.
205560	208560	You sly dog. Alright, I'mma get it, I'mma get it.
208560	209560	TK.
209560	210560	What?
210560	211560	Are you kidding me?
211560	212560	Look, Tro calls and put me on to something, right?
212560	213560	Oh, hey, Tro.
213560	214560	Ah, hello, Em.
214560	216560	Finally told him about that VPN, huh?
216560	217560	What?
217560	218560	He's always been a bit slow, hasn't he?
218560	219560	Always.
219560	220560	Private call?
220560	221560	Hey, pull up.
224560	228560	I was so healthy.
228560	232560	I had rice and beans and fish.
232560	234560	Maybe this is all water weight.
234560	235560	I'm holding on to water weight.
235560	237560	I need to get this off my chest.
237560	240560	I need to, you know, for my heart.
240560	241560	For my heart.
241560	243560	I don't even know why.
243560	244560	I don't know what I did to deserve this.
244560	246560	I have no idea what I did wrong.
246560	248560	I am not having it today.
249560	265560	Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
265560	270000	too much free time, and what a year 2020 has quickly devolved into.
270000	275360	The turn of a new decade was met by excitement and anticipation from many, myself included.
275360	280360	Needless to say, I think disappointed may be an understatement when summarising my sentiments.
280360	284280	With the world falling down around us, it can be easy to lose faith in humanity, but
284280	286480	maybe that faith was misplaced all along.
286480	287480	What do I mean?
287480	289760	Well, let's dabble into today's topic.
289760	290760	Drama.
290760	294420	In the world of YouTube, the word drama is typically used to refer to a conflict regarding
294420	297000	a creator or multiple creators at that.
297000	300280	It's a pretty central theme to the current content that I make on my channel, and is
300280	303040	a focal point for multiple commentators alike.
303040	307520	We tend to associate most drama with a more contemporary era of YouTube, originating from
307520	313280	the mid 2010s, spearheaded by many commentators, and popularised by series like Content Cop.
313280	317640	But drama has existed since the dawn of YouTube, but I remember all the way back in 2012 when
317640	322840	I watched a lot of Call of Duty content, because, as you know, I am a gamer, and there was a
322840	327320	very renowned Callout video uploaded which obtained well over a million views, and probably
327320	330480	would have obtained many more if it hadn't been deleted.
330480	334600	In an environment like that, such a statistic was hugely impressive, and it had a great
334600	339600	impact on the YouTuber it was directed at who left the internet altogether shortly after.
339600	344080	However, with the constant manifestation of communities, and lack of real culture surrounding
344080	348400	the nature of drama, with it more seeming like an unintended side effect, nothing ever
348400	353600	seemed to mould its way into YouTube history, and we tend to reminisce about the early 2010s
353600	357200	on YouTube with the innocent nostalgia that we have since assigned to it.
357200	361440	That's not a facet that can be considered with the commentary era, and since its rise,
361440	367560	every major conflict seems like a blemish imprinted on this beautiful platform, for better and for worse.
367560	371200	Yet the sensation that drama provokes has ever remained the same.
371200	376520	It was still one of the most iconic feelings when that Call of Duty drama in 2012 was transpiring.
376520	380440	It was a rush, someone being exposed, conflict within the community.
380440	385320	The truth is plain, many creators and audiences alike thrive on drama.
385360	391800	The appeal of it is indisputable, and as it has grown out of its reputation as a byproduct and into its own genre,
391800	396840	it has become more powerful, and people feel less afraid to indulge their more dramatic side.
396840	401840	On top of this, with the increased mobilisation of online communities, it has been granted additional
401840	405560	consequential value that we can observe over the past few years.
405560	411000	One of the most prominent outcomes of this is exposed culture, when a person makes strong or revelatory
411000	416680	claims regarding another individual and their behaviour, typically with the intent of depicting a character
416680	421480	that had previously not been shown to the audience. You might find someone sitting quite sternly,
421480	425800	glaring at the camera, before going into the details of whatever they wish to disclose,
425800	431320	or you might just see a neatly posted twit longer. The overarching message will tell you that this person
431320	437120	isn't who you thought they were, whether it's mere business malpractice, or something a little more sinister.
437160	444040	There can be very real ramifications. The mid-2010s weren't just for sowing the seeds of drama and commentary though,
444040	449760	no, in fact, many new creative genres rose to YouTube prominence, one of those being Mukbang's.
449760	454920	Mukbang is another delightful portmanteau whose literal translation would be eatcast.
454920	458680	With such information, you can probably take a guess at what I'm referring to.
459560	462400	Three, two, one, go.
462400	468680	Yes, the videos where we have an individual consuming portions of food, often accompanied by them making casual chitchat
468680	476160	with the audience. It originated in South Korea towards the end of the 2000s, but only really caught fire in 2015,
476160	482000	when a few larger channels began to pay attention to it. Since then, we've seen a wave of creators all over the spectrum
482000	487120	take part, either engaging in it as a side-venture, or as their dedicated pursuits.
487120	493360	So we have drama and Mukbang simultaneously emerging into the limelight, two seemingly quite distinct genres,
493360	496480	but what would you end up with if you merged the two together?
496480	516320	Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce you to Nikocado Avocado, on one hand, a fairly straightforward Mukbang creator
516320	523400	who just likes a good meal, on the other hand, a seemingly elaborate troll who will jump at the opportunity to be taken
523440	526560	seriously, and use the power how he sees fits.
526560	534760	I'm my own empire now, I'm the Mukbang king, and you messed with the wrong person.
534760	541280	Over the last few years, he has emerged as an influential figure in the Mukbang community, obtaining millions of subscribers
541280	548440	over five channels, nothing to be sneered at. However, his stint on the platform has been plagued with controversy,
548480	555200	drama, exposés, and some pretty serious allegations, both given and taken, which may leave you wondering,
555200	561840	how hard is it to eat your damn dinner? If this story was just about a guy who ate food and cried little,
561840	566960	then there wouldn't be too much to say, but scratch below the surface and you'll find an extensive history of drama,
566960	573480	chaos, and one of the strangest embodiments of exposed culture to boot. At the centre, a man who simultaneously
574480	580800	never fails to fascinate the ardent YouTube commentator. How did he get here? How did we get here?
580800	586800	Well, join me today as I tell you about the somewhat strange story behind the rise of Nikocado Avocado,
586800	592520	and the rather twisted side to what could have been any other content creator, and the never-ending nightmare
592520	595240	that Mr Avocado in fact represents.
595240	598880	Eating food on camera? How problematic can that be?
598880	606240	Do you know what it's like to be alive for 27 years? I don't even know what that means.
606240	611520	What does it mean? What does it mean to be alive for 27 years? What does it mean?
611520	618520	I'm just here, I'm just here, and I'm just stuck in this mess. I'm stuck.
619960	625000	Well, Mr Avocado appears to have risen to the challenge, so I suggest we find out.
628880	646680	As we have just outlined, Mukbang didn't emerge into the public consciousness until the early 2010s.
646680	652800	This means that practically all Mukbang creators had alternative careers before their YouTube channels took off.
652840	659040	Nikocado Avocado is no different in that regard, however, his story is one of particular curiosity.
659040	661920	What do I mean? Well, let's start off with a little clip.
661920	682680	That is obviously a wedding, however, there are a few details that may contribute to the intrigue.
682680	690360	Firstly, it was a vegan wedding, and secondly, as you may notice, it was accompanied by a rather delightful violin recital.
690440	695760	That violinist was someone by the name of Albert Einstein, I'm just f**king with you, it's Nikocado Avocado.
695760	703760	Veganism affects not only yourself, but it affects other people, it affects the environment, it affects the animals,
703760	708560	of course, animals that are being raised and killed for our consumption and usage.
708560	713160	It affects us spiritually and mentally, physically, of course.
713160	719560	Yes, this is Nikocado Avocado, as you can probably tell, he hasn't started making the Mukbang content
719560	725760	that he is renowned for quite yet, in fact, he was on what many would interpret as the opposite end of the spectrum,
725760	728360	he was indeed a vegan.
728360	738960	This is the present. Look, Nikocado Avocado got an avocado. How cliche is this? So cliche, I can't even.
738960	746120	Most content involving him in this phase was uploaded between 2014 and 2016, however, if you were feeling particularly
746520	752520	inquisitive, you could dredge up an old Twitter which advertised his violin skills, including an audition for The Glee Project,
752520	758920	which was a reality TV series where the winner could have their own 7 episode character arc on the titular show.
758920	766120	Unfortunately for Nik, opportunity didn't come knocking this time, and his existence continued to be quite ordinary.
766120	770920	This is where we should introduce another creator, this gentleman goes by the name of Orlin.
770920	776520	Orlin had a YouTube channel known as Orlin Home, on this channel, he would post a lot of vegan related content,
776520	782120	most of it has been removed, but thanks to this one old screenshot, and some old videos still up on his YouTube channel,
782120	786920	you can see what the content, now belonging to one of Nik's alts, used to be.
786920	791320	My name is Nicholas, and I'm hungry.
791320	803720	Now, at this point, Orlin was in a relationship with our good friend Nik here, in fact, in this 2013 screenshot,
803720	807920	you can see them posing for a very cute couple's profile pic, how adorable.
807920	813440	Orlin lived in Colombia, and they would visit each other on a somewhat regular basis, however, this meant that
813440	818320	Nik would feature in some of Orlin's videos, however, Orlin held down the channel.
818320	823320	It seems, although he was active in the vegan community, YouTube wasn't always Nik's priority,
823320	826320	although in a later video, he would say this.
826320	835320	In 2012, 2013, one of the two, I put out this big animal rights video on my YouTube channel, on my old YouTube channel.
835320	840320	Implying that he had been doing some online activism, though not under his current alias.
840320	848320	No, it wouldn't be until 2014 that Nik would initiate Project Nikocado Avocado, and even then it would appear to be dormant,
848320	853320	this screenshot showing that despite of his subscribers, he otherwise had no activity.
853320	860320	Now, there was activity, but for many people looking, you'd have a hard time finding that, but we'll save that tea until later.
860320	866320	This didn't mean he didn't upload, and wouldn't appear in various videos with other vegan creators, promoting that healthy lifestyle.
866320	872320	Most of this collab content appeared throughout the span of 2016, while he was still identifying as a vegan.
872320	878320	At this point, certain vegan creators have picked up the mukbang concept as a means to promote their lifestyle,
878320	885320	and provide fairly easy-going, accessible content for audiences, especially those who may not be interested in veganism regardless.
885320	891320	Nik collaborated with a few prominent creators at the time, including Brianna Jackson, Cheap Lazy Vegan,
891320	896320	and the somewhat popular creator Mummy Tang, who by the way seems like the most delightful person,
896320	899320	and I will be highly disappointed if she ends up being exposed.
911320	915320	In a lot of the content that has remained on YouTube from this Nik Avocado era,
915320	918320	there is definitely a lot of flexing regarding his healthy lifestyle.
918320	944320	Now, some vegans are known to be vocal regarding the proclaimed health benefits that such a lifestyle can provide,
944320	950320	and they are completely at liberty to do that, but Nik's comments never seemed to pertain the dogmatic conviction
950320	955320	that I'd come to expect from such lifestyle professionals. Maybe I'm biased from what I know now,
955320	960320	but after watching his pre-mukbang content, the transition began to make more sense than less.
960320	965320	One video that did catch my interest was an upload where All In talks about Nik's first time.
965320	971320	Now, if you were going by the title, you may assume something a bit more racy, however, it's actually the first time
972320	978320	which given the channel branding is obviously a big deal. Nonetheless, elements of the rhetoric caught my attention.
994320	998320	It seems that over the years, although it may not have been documented too clearly,
998320	1004320	All In and Nik's attitude to diet has seemingly softened, and at this point, although they may have still
1004320	1008320	identified as vegans, they would gradually take more latitude within their lifestyle.
1008320	1013320	This could also be seen in Nik's own content, although no longer on YouTube,
1013320	1018320	I found some Facebook posts that do begin to show the transition his content made in 2016.
1018320	1024320	He always seemed to trade in clickbait type content, and indulge in a more mainstream approach towards presentation
1024320	1029320	than his partner. However, nothing really caught my attention until around July of that year, firstly,
1029320	1034320	some routine mukbang content, but in the thumbnail, he would advertise how many calories are being consumed,
1034320	1039320	a grand 2000 in that one. This calorie content would also increase in future uploads that month,
1039320	1045320	and he'd go on to promote vegan food that in spite of their vegan nature was otherwise rather unhealthy.
1045320	1051320	On top of this, there is another video uploaded a couple days later, which appears to be a pretty fiery response
1051320	1054320	to another pair of creators within the vegan community.
1054320	1059320	With this level of knowledge, we can tell that Nik's outspoken nature would lead to polarization,
1059320	1064320	as displayed by many of his own comments around the time, and his mukbang style content showed the direction
1064320	1069320	that he was headed. Over the next few months, his style would transform completely.
1069320	1071320	Let's talk about that transformation.
1082320	1088320	Now, Nik's transition has to be split into one of two stages, transition out of the vegan community,
1088320	1093320	and transition out of veganism altogether, so I'll be splitting this into these two stages,
1093320	1095320	and the observations that can be made with them.
1095320	1101320	I am not a vegan, I'm sure many people will be aware of that, but at the same time, I'm rather indifferent to the lifestyle,
1101320	1107320	and for many people, being vegan isn't something that they advertise on YouTube or in real life.
1107320	1113320	However, vegans do receive a bit of stigma due to the self-superior attitude that a vocal few of them have.
1113320	1118320	Now, I don't think this reputation is completely warranted, because every belief system which has what they perceive
1118320	1124320	as moral foundations is bound to have some evangelical individuals. It's not that dissimilar to a religion.
1124320	1129320	However, this means a few things. First of all, that the YouTube vegan community is probably gonna be a bit more dramatic
1129320	1135320	than one might expect, because those most outspoken on their cause are often going to seek out mediums to maximize
1135320	1140320	their influence, and when that happens, you'll likely have pushback, from outside, from people who hate your position
1140320	1145320	as much as you hate theirs, and from within, from people who think that your attitude is the wrong way to bring
1145320	1150320	change to the world. Nick definitely seemed like the sort of person to be quite vocal against those in his own community,
1150320	1156320	and his posts seemed to prove that as well. Whether his points were rational or reasonable is another question which I
1156320	1161320	wasn't really able to deduce from his titles or Facebook posts alone, so we'll save this point until later.
1161320	1167320	However, one thing is certain, these sorts of dramas will lead to inevitable alienation from that community,
1167320	1173320	and much less obligation for the binding values that drive such a clique. So with this personal experience,
1173320	1180320	Nick decided to quit the vegan community, uploading a 35 minute video at the start of September, announcing this,
1180320	1182320	with his own justifications.
1182320	1187320	I haven't made a video for about one week now, and I have my reasons for that.
1188320	1195320	I'm a little uncertain on how to properly begin this video, because there's a lot on my mind, and it comes from various angles.
1195320	1201320	Now, this isn't the most necessary to the arc today, but it is an important pit stop, so I'll do my best to summarise.
1201320	1206320	First of all, Nick is sick of the puritanical nature of certain factions of the vegan community.
1206320	1212320	He's fed up of the quote, raw vegans, those who only support vegan food being eaten raw, and he's fed up of their
1212320	1217320	attitude towards others within the community. He thought by leaving that community himself, he'd be able to escape
1217320	1223320	those with that mentality, but ultimately, he was not able to, and realised this spilled over into all communities
1223320	1228320	relating to veganism. I will now show a select number of clips which both reflect the nature of the video,
1228320	1231320	and are definitely not ironic in the slightest.
1232320	1236320	...to talk about your lifestyle. The cool thing to do is talk about someone's personal life, or this person's
1236320	1240320	sent a d**k pic, or this person did this, or this person said this, and this person got cheated on.
1240320	1244320	That's why this community s**t me now. This is why I want to leave.
1244320	1250320	People fighting, people making videos about who texted who, who cheated on who, who said what, taking screenshots
1250320	1256320	of comments from months ago and making dramatic videos about it. Like, if that is evident with just a few thousand
1256320	1260320	people in the world who have gone vegan, then if the whole world goes vegan, we are not saved either.
1260320	1267320	Mommy Tang, even Mommy Tang, who's done nothing to attack, or belittle, or chastise vegan YouTubers publicly,
1267320	1272320	she still gets picked on, she still gets dramatic videos made about her, she still gets the crazies that are coming
1272320	1276320	after her and threatening her life. What is with it with the vegans?
1276320	1282320	As a side note, whoever's been messing with Mommy Tang better back up. You mess with Mommy Tang, you mess with me.
1282320	1288320	Now, throughout the video, he still refers to himself as a vegan, and even states this towards the end.
1289320	1296320	I'm still vegan, I love animals, I care for them, I haven't had animal products for over four and a half years,
1296320	1302320	but I'm done talking about it, which is really, really unfortunate. I'm done saying vegan, because I know it turns
1302320	1307320	so many people off, and even the people that are on your team are the first ones to bat you on the head,
1307320	1309320	just look at this community, you guys.
1309320	1315320	This was not the end of the vegan diet for Nick Avocado, it was just the end of the vegan community,
1315320	1320320	and although the like to dislike ratio on this video doesn't flatter him, it's not an unreasonable video
1320320	1325320	for what it's worth. Although he had shown capability to involve himself with drama in the past,
1325320	1330320	this seemed like a distancing from that, and he was ready to move on and be more mature.
1330320	1335320	Over the next few months, he would gradually adjust his content to that more mukbang oriented.
1335320	1339320	There were other uploads, but they were generally phased out. One observation that you could make
1339320	1343320	is that although the food was still vegan, it wasn't exactly healthy.
1343320	1347320	I don't think I'm making any shocking revelations here, but vegan food isn't always healthy,
1347320	1352320	and some substitutes can be very unhealthy. Nick was definitely playing more into the cheat day side
1352320	1356320	of a vegan diet, apart from the fact that he was cheating every day.
1356320	1362320	Nick- Sloths, welcome to another mukbang. Seriously, you guys, I've been busy all day long.
1362320	1368320	I started out with an entire Domino's Pizza onto myself down my throat,
1368320	1373320	and then I also had Subway, the entire sub, down my throat.
1373320	1377320	And this is not included in all the fruit I had in the morning, plus a little rice.
1377320	1383320	Now it's dinner time. I've filmed three mukbangs back today, and here I go.
1383320	1388320	However, some of the videos became very popular, and looking at an old Social Blade screenshot,
1388320	1391320	you could see that his success came rapidly with the change in content.
1391320	1396320	Certain videos did extremely well, and subscribers began to flood in at an unprecedented rate.
1396320	1403320	It seems by leaving a toxic community behind, he was able to carve out his own niche of casually vegan mukbang content.
1403320	1406320	However, Nick wasn't quite satisfied with this.
1406320	1410320	Nick- Right then and there. So anyways, now I eat whatever I want, as long as it's plant-based,
1410320	1415320	but I still, my memory, you guys, is bad.
1415320	1422320	My clumsiness is getting out of hand. No matter how much I eat, how much I sleep,
1422320	1429320	how much I exercise, excuse me, eat my fruits and veggies, and even have my fun with fried food.
1429320	1432320	Sometimes, I have doubts.
1432320	1437320	These concerns would all be put on show in his video called I Don't Want To Be Vegan Anymore,
1437320	1443320	which showcases Nick wrestling back and forth with his animal rights principles and dietary requirements.
1443320	1449320	But I have to be myself, and I have to be honest with how I feel if I want to keep doing this, right?
1450320	1455320	But you just want me to lie, and say that this is how humans were designed to be,
1455320	1458320	even though there's never been a culture or civilization on Earth to ever do it.
1458320	1464320	It's okay, that's what's really natural. Even when we're evolving, eating bugs and other animals in the rainforests.
1464320	1467320	It's okay, don't worry about them. What I'm doing is right and natural.
1467320	1472320	It definitely showcases a more emotional side to him, and being emotional isn't an inherently bad thing,
1472320	1476320	but the video itself is pretty unfocused, and doesn't seem to have the clarity of reasoning
1476320	1479320	that his video on departing the vegan community had.
1480320	1485320	We come from different parts of the world. We have different abilities to tolerate this and that.
1485320	1492320	Some people just like bananas. Some people hate bananas. Some people can't stand lentils. Some people like them.
1492320	1498320	Some people have different genes. Did you know? Did you know that this is so true?
1498320	1505320	You know, I used to believe, oh we're all evil. No. It's so true that there is a huge foundation
1505320	1509320	to investigate and study the Jewish genes.
1509320	1513320	It's not like I don't think there are reasons why one may need to change dietary consumption.
1513320	1517320	I doubt that the amount of vegan food consumption would have been good for you.
1517320	1522320	But Nick seems to be more improvising on the spot, rather than explaining why he's made a thought out decision.
1522320	1524320	Here are some highlights.
1524320	1529320	I think I'm missing something. It's so annoying. Like I told myself it's a blessing disguise that I do eating shows,
1529320	1534320	because I can eat an insane amount of food every single day and stay relatively thin, whatever.
1534320	1539320	But that doesn't mean I feel good. And it's annoying to have to eat so often.
1539320	1546320	It is annoying to have to like be obsessed. Be obsessed. What am I going to eat next?
1546320	1549320	Where am I going to get my food? Is that vegan? Is that vegan too?
1549320	1555320	Now I have to vegan. It's annoying. If you're deficient in something, it doesn't matter how much you tell yourself.
1555320	1559320	Well, I'm going to do it for the animals. I'm going to do it to save the environment, save the trees.
1559320	1561320	The poor trees are being chopped down for cows right now.
1561320	1567320	I need to just, you can't be deficient for that long for the trees or for the cows.
1567320	1569320	Does that make sense biologically?
1569320	1573320	Crooked. Do you guys know The Richest? It was a video about the world's oldest people.
1573320	1579320	Okay. And it had like 20 old, the world's oldest people, not a single one of them were vegan. Okay.
1579320	1586320	And the oldest lived lady on earth ate three eggs a day. And that was her secret to living long.
1586320	1592320	Now I'm not saying everyone should eat three eggs a day, but I am showing that we aren't all the same.
1592320	1598320	You don't understand the reason I changed the type of vegan diet I eat so much year after year after year after year.
1599320	1604320	It's because eventually what I was doing didn't feel right. And I feel like I'm at the end.
1604320	1611320	What is there left to try? Supplementing 15,000 things every day? I don't have that kind of money.
1611320	1616320	So that's not an option. I'm not going to do juice cleanses. I'm not going to fast.
1616320	1620320	I'm not going to go back to raw food. I'm not going to eat just potatoes.
1620320	1626320	I'm not just going to eat rice and sugar. They don't make me feel good long-term.
1626320	1628320	Let's talk about this more.
1630320	1634320	Alright, so you can say what you want about his videos. They're a bit strange and hard to follow,
1634320	1640320	and it's easy to look at his content and think that he may have his own reasons for wanting to leave vegan content behind.
1640320	1645320	He's talking about the health of his diet, but ultimately there's nothing particularly healthy in what he was doing.
1645320	1650320	How many of his viewers pointed this out at the time? Vegan substitutes don't place you above the health consequences
1650320	1653320	when you're ingesting colossal volumes for YouTube content.
1653320	1658320	However, although he may seem a tad ignorant, you wouldn't notice much provocation in his language.
1658320	1664320	Sure, he may have some accountability issues, but it was possible to give his intent the benefit of the doubt,
1664320	1669320	for the moment at least. That moment lasted shorter than one might expect, as less than 4 days later,
1669320	1674320	he uploaded a video called Why Veganism is Wrong and Makes People Go Crazy.
1674320	1679320	In the 50 minute video, he ups his arguments to 11, but something feels kinda off.
1680320	1685320	To think that we live in a world where it's just pure and there's never consequences,
1685320	1692320	or to be healthy, you don't have to contribute to something bad in order to get positive effects from it,
1692320	1697320	doesn't make sense. I mean, it might be a stretch, correct me if I'm wrong, but it very well could be,
1697320	1703320	but I'm thinking these are just little examples. I think of the Holocaust. The Holocaust was an awful, awful thing.
1703320	1709320	People had to suffer. People were displaced around the world. People were angry.
1709320	1718320	But what came of it? New laws. Change. Beautiful, beautiful art. Beautiful, beautiful music.
1718320	1722320	Sometimes, light comes out of darkness.
1722320	1729320	A lot of the video is him speaking very broadly about this idea of veganism, without any concise direction.
1729320	1735320	A lot of the time, I was unsure about the point he was trying to prove, even though he had some all-caps bold title
1735320	1740320	with a very clear point, the video itself didn't have that bite, no pun intended.
1740320	1744320	There are a lot of anecdotes, and mostly about people who Nick knew.
1744320	1748320	You don't think I've tried. Maybe you guys don't remember the interviews.
1748320	1753320	Skype called Dr. McDougall, Dr. Fuhrman, talked to Michael Greger.
1753320	1760320	I remember there was this one girl, very, very, very popular. She was one of the most watched YouTube channel.
1760320	1765320	You don't know who I'm talking about. It's a mysterious person. But she was vegan. This was five, six years ago.
1765320	1771320	There was a huge train of people coming out. This only happened within a few months, and then they were just kind of ignored,
1771320	1773320	and hopefully what they were saying would disappear.
1773320	1775320	A lot of you guys that knew me back then are probably going to know who I'm talking about.
1775320	1780320	A huge train of people, group of people that all got blood works, and they had high triglycerides.
1780320	1785320	I remember, I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable, but I will say, without saying their names,
1785320	1792320	they were their three brothers, and they were very popular, and they had all these fans,
1792320	1796320	and they were really into building muscle, and being athletes, and this and that.
1796320	1800320	In another example, I was literally just out of the blue. This is perfect timing.
1800320	1804320	Just a week ago, maybe, maybe even less, like five days ago, I was on the phone with a friend,
1804320	1810320	and she told me about this guy that was very like, rah, rah, rah, animal rights, animal rights, animal rights,
1810320	1815320	and he participated in protests, and I think he did a few undercover slaughterhouse investigate,
1815320	1819320	like helped produce those videos, or spread the social media, something like that.
1819320	1823320	Very, very enthusiastic about it, and he was vegan for three years, I think.
1823320	1827320	Two, two or three years, not like a long, long time, but still, you know, three years is a long time.
1827320	1832320	Twenty minutes ago, today is Monday, I literally got a message on Facebook from a friend,
1832320	1835320	she's really, really nice, and I kind of hung out with her this summer and stuff,
1835320	1839320	and she sent me a message saying, hey, I saw your first video about questioning veganism,
1839320	1843320	and I want to let you know that, you know, you're in doubt, and that's okay,
1843320	1847320	and I want, I'm here for you if you want to talk, because she's vegan, but her partner stopped being vegan.
1847320	1851320	He had been vegan for like eight years, like a long, long time, eight years, ten years, twelve years,
1851320	1856320	like a long time. Yeah, basically said that, you know, it was very scary, because they're circle friends,
1856320	1858320	they weren't sure how they would treat him, and this and that.
1858320	1862320	Okay, I got an email from someone named ****, don't want to say her name,
1862320	1866320	and she's basically saying, look, I followed your path as well, she's been vegan for ten years.
1866320	1873320	He specifically asked me not to share this message, but he is Native American,
1873320	1880320	and he told me that there's this huge misconception that Native Americans were very sad when they had a cure,
1880320	1882320	and they felt so sad that they did it because it's all they had.
1882320	1885320	Jesus Christ, Nick, is there anyone you don't know?
1885320	1890320	And it's not like I don't believe these people don't exist, a good anecdote can always spice up a video,
1890320	1897320	but when used to the degree that Nick uses them, it feels like a limp substitute for real evidence-based arguments,
1897320	1899320	that Nick himself seems to be aware of.
1899320	1903320	Saying things without concrete evidence, using cherry-pick studies, it's no, listen,
1903320	1906320	I know the meat industry probably does the same thing, so people buy more of their products,
1906320	1913320	but there has to be a happy medium, and there is a reason why a lot of people have problems down the road.
1913320	1918320	If I was to provide a personal opinion on the video, it feels like Nick had already made the decision,
1918320	1924320	and was trying to play out his transition as naturally as possible, perhaps justify it to himself,
1924320	1928320	though he may have a point about the craziest thing, given that two uploads later,
1928320	1931320	he's really out here putting pineapples on his pizza.
1931320	1935320	I could say more about this video, but it is rather tame for what the title may imply,
1935320	1940320	however, one important takeaway, other than the food, is that Nick wasn't running from drama anymore.
1940320	1946320	The video's provocative title and opening tone was more than enough to irritate defensive vegans,
1946320	1949320	some of whom, I'm sure, were part of Nick's own audience.
1949320	1953320	He frames it like a personal battle, but when you brand your video with such broad strokes,
1953320	1956320	you're not far off the backlash, and he wasn't.
1956320	1961320	That video scored a negative light to dislike ratio, with many people expressing their disappointment.
1962320	1965320	However, there's no way that someone like Nick didn't anticipate this,
1965320	1969320	he had already shown an awareness of the toxicity, what were his intentions?
1969320	1973320	Well, over the next few months, Nick began to reveal these intentions,
1973320	1977320	he made a couple more vegan videos, but then began to advertise his shift away from veganism,
1977320	1981320	finally celebrating his full departure with a trip to Domino's Pizza.
1981320	1985320	An interesting choice, considering one of his concerns about veganism were the health risks.
1985320	1990320	These health risks continued to escalate over future videos, bringing his intent into question,
1990320	1994320	nevertheless, he continued to proclaim the benefits of his new diet.
1995320	2002320	I gave it an honest attempt like no other, and sure, I was skinny for the majority of all these diets.
2002320	2006320	I feel like I'm even thinner now than many points when I was raw vegan.
2007320	2013320	Such a swollen face, and I still get very swollen faces, and I'm gonna talk about this in this video.
2014320	2017320	It's been every single day of eating animal products.
2018320	2023320	I... feel so... good.
2025320	2030320	It's like a light bulb went off, it's like I shooed off a light.
2033320	2037320	It's like a new set of batteries have been implanted into my head.
2039320	2041320	Talk about sustainable energy.
2042320	2046320	And I'm not gonna be the one to defend the vegan diet as the ideal lifestyle for everyone,
2046320	2049320	but Nick's solution wasn't the reasonable answer.
2049320	2053320	In his vegan questioning content, he spoke a lot of the time about bringing up diet
2053320	2056320	and what human beings need to maintain a balanced intake.
2056320	2060320	Okay, maybe 50 of you, there's 50, you've got 50 people right now.
2060320	2063320	You're watching this video and you're in the same position as me,
2063320	2067320	you've been vegan for many, many years, and you're starting to have some doubts.
2067320	2071320	And maybe you're getting some blood work back, and your B12's low, and your iron's low,
2071320	2074320	your omegas are low, your calcium is low, you're not getting vitamin K2.
2075320	2079320	Where do you get vitamin K2? How do you absorb calcium if you're not eating sauerkraut every day?
2079320	2082320	Well, there's K2 in animal products, but what do you do if you don't eat them?
2082320	2086320	There's all these different things. Abimin. Where do you get them? Huh?
2086320	2091320	However, in response to this, he merely introduces meat to his already excessive diet,
2091320	2095320	indulging himself to outrageous proportions, 10,000 calorie challenges,
2095320	2100320	so much past food, I'm surprised he can't single-handedly support their value on the stock market.
2100320	2104320	Because of this, people began picking up on his rather unhealthy consumption habits,
2104320	2108320	and raising their concerns that this was not conducive to the lifestyle he had previously aspired for.
2108320	2114320	However, in the true nature of the internet, some people went a tad too far and began diagnosing him with eating disorders.
2114320	2119320	A lot of these people who were attacking Nick appeared to be those of the vegan lifestyle,
2119320	2125320	and ultimately, he used a lot of this to justify another video against these individuals who were coming at him on his channel.
2126320	2135320	Over the past month, I have gotten thousands. Thousands.
2135320	2144320	To the extent where I have friends reaching out to me, people I haven't even talked to for like a year or two,
2144320	2148320	sending me messages on Facebook or even emails.
2149320	2157320	Nick, I heard that you have an eating disorder, and I just want to let you know I'm here for you,
2157320	2160320	if you need help with it or talking about it.
2160320	2167320	Nick, I heard that you're throwing up your food. You have bulimia.
2167320	2172320	And, you know, why didn't you tell me? I thought I was your best friend.
2173320	2179320	I have to say, I'm somewhat skeptical that it's thousands of people, but we will entertain this for the sake of discourse.
2179320	2185320	Now, I don't think it was fair to accuse him of being bulimic, or assigning any eating disorder without clear proof.
2185320	2188320	You can always tell someone to go get help because they may have a problem,
2188320	2193320	but straight up shouting at them is never gonna make them listen, and Nick had chosen a perspective at that point.
2193320	2199320	He was going to dig in his heels as much as possible, so a lot of people coming at him was just perfect ammunition to fire back,
2199320	2201320	which is what he did.
2201320	2209320	I have been doing mukbangs for months, many months, ever since last January of 2016, that's been a year.
2209320	2213320	I mean, it wasn't that regular back then, it was maybe once every two weeks, once a week, something like that,
2213320	2218320	but I've been doing them every single day for like four months, eating plant-based foods.
2218320	2222320	But, when I stopped being vegan, all the vegans now are coming on saying,
2222320	2227320	oh, you have bulimia, oh, you have purging. They never said it before if I was eating the vegan calories,
2227320	2231320	but since the calories are coming from animal products, oh, I have an eating disorder.
2231320	2236320	That is terrible. I don't even know the rationale.
2236320	2241320	This is reasonable content to make a video on in principle, but for a person who had previously shined away from drama,
2241320	2244320	he was suddenly, once again, rather outspoken.
2244320	2248320	Now, there are many theories for why this may be, but for me, at this point, it seemed quite straightforward.
2248320	2252320	He wanted to rebuke many naysayers who were saying he couldn't pull off this transition,
2252320	2255320	while also strengthening some bonds with his most loyal subscribers.
2255320	2260320	He had built up this brand as the former vegan who had made content on them in the past.
2260320	2264320	He was aware of how volatile some of them can be, but rather than running away from them,
2264320	2270320	he was running towards them, blowing off that drama, facing off their points about his new diet and the health considerations.
2270320	2276320	Make no mistake, the worst of a community is never pleasant, but sometimes behind the worthless anger,
2276320	2281320	there may be a legitimate point, and Nick was about to start losing that argument.
2285320	2292320	INTRO
2292320	2295320	Nick's always been a rather calculated creator.
2295320	2298320	You can often tell this by the construction of his thumbnails and titles,
2298320	2302320	although certain behavioural patterns may have an arc, his clickbait doesn't.
2302320	2306320	With his content, he'll be sat down on the verge of tears in many screenshots,
2306320	2309320	crying profusely, such as I'm sorry I was wrong.
2309320	2314320	Looks very emotional, but the video itself is just him talking for 35 minutes in a rather calm tone.
2314320	2321320	So, during my journey, not all of it, but many moments of it, I just treated my own race,
2321320	2326320	my own species, like dirt, because of what they were eating.
2326320	2334320	So I have a list here, again, this is not to stereotype, this is not to degrade, this is not to be disrespectful,
2334320	2340320	this is about what happened to me and my experience, alright, my mistakes.
2340320	2343320	In this video, he once again spoke about the vegan community,
2343320	2347320	this time apologising to those he alienated while he was a vegan.
2347320	2350320	However, in some interesting retrospective reframing,
2350320	2352320	he states that although he was obviously confused at the time,
2352320	2357320	his main priority for shifting away from veganism was for the sake of mental health,
2357320	2359320	and the truth is, he has never felt better.
2359320	2364320	Did I decide I wanted to stop? I made a few videos, they were very controversial,
2364320	2368320	I was confused as ever, talking about how the primary reason for me was mental health,
2368320	2373320	that was the number one thing I said over and over, I felt like something was wrong in my head.
2373320	2377320	Now this isn't exactly what he was previously arguing, but hey, good for him.
2377320	2380320	If he makes him feel mentally better, then that's what matters.
2380320	2386320	I have to admit, the cynic in me looked at this video as another rather underhanded way to get at vegans,
2386320	2390320	but he does defend the lifestyle, and it would be a lot of effort to just prove a single point,
2390320	2395320	so it would be unfair of me to make a judgement call, in spite of my thoughts about the levels of calculation.
2395320	2399320	There's another point that I'll bring attention to with recognition to his drama videos,
2399320	2402320	they often obtained less views than his mukbang content,
2402320	2406320	which means that his motives for these videos weren't exactly view oriented.
2406320	2410320	With that in mind, they didn't feel completely sincere either.
2410320	2416320	Now, with the knowledge of where Nick is today, everyone has one video where they think his behaviour began to unravel.
2416320	2421320	Now, as you can probably observe with what we know thus far, it has been a gradual process,
2421320	2426320	however, for me, it takes a nosedive with one particular video, known as This Is Not Okay,
2426320	2431320	which unlike other videos, lives up to the thumbnail, but I kinda wish it hadn't.
2431320	2435320	You know, Orlin was trying to help me, because I am, I am clueless in the kitchen,
2435320	2439320	I don't even know how to cut a carrot.
2442320	2446320	It's a very uncomfortable video where Nick airs his painful relationship issues with Orlin,
2446320	2451320	basically going back over a situation, and frankly, some rather inappropriate details.
2451320	2456320	Nick- I took the dive, and I said, what are you doing?
2459320	2463320	And he was so sad, he's just like, I hate my life, I hate my life, I hate my life.
2465320	2469320	There are multiple aspects that I thoroughly dislike about this video, firstly the excessive crying.
2469320	2473320	Now, emotion is okay to an extent, sometimes we channel emotion through our rhetoric,
2473320	2476320	and that can be constructive to conveying our feelings,
2476320	2479320	but when it's emotional to the point of interrupting the video's message,
2479320	2484320	then to many it can feel manipulative, particularly combined with the process of editing and uploading.
2484320	2488320	Now, with that said, the emotions do match what he's talking about in the video,
2488320	2491320	I would probably be thoroughly upset too, but that's the second point,
2491320	2494320	there is no way that this content should have been uploaded,
2494320	2497320	it's graphic details regarding someone else's struggle,
2497320	2500320	and unless you're presenting it with their permission and in a helpful way,
2500320	2502320	then you should not be uploading it.
2502320	2507320	A formally pinned, and possibly now deleted comment by Orlin stated that he had provided permission
2507320	2513320	as the video was filmed two days after, however, this is directly contradicted by Nick's own statements in the video.
2513320	2517320	Nick- Last night we were in bed, we were in here, and he came up the stairs,
2517320	2521320	and his stomach comes out of his arm.
2521320	2524320	So something happened just right now.
2524320	2529320	This brings into question the creation and intent of such an upload, and the nature of this relationship.
2529320	2533320	On top of this, given the video's reactionary tone, it gives me an even stronger impression
2533320	2537320	that it wasn't something that was created as a reflection a couple days after,
2537320	2542320	and even if it was, it doesn't feel like it represented a truth, more a means of exploitation.
2542320	2545320	However, this brings me to my greatest problem.
2546320	2551320	Nick- So I don't know what to think, I remember we were late in bed last night,
2551320	2557320	and I was saying to myself, like, this is not good, we're about to get buried.
2557320	2563320	And I made him so upset that he **** himself.
2563320	2568320	The fact that Nick makes it about himself, and that's what I really dislike about it,
2568320	2572320	the waterworks that draw attention away from the actual story, and more to his reaction,
2572320	2576320	the almost irrelevant anecdotes that seek to justify his position,
2576320	2580320	it gives the impression that he's asking for sympathy from his audience for a situation
2580320	2583320	that they wouldn't have been aware of regardless, and they should not be,
2583320	2585320	certainly not for a video like this at least.
2585320	2590320	The only content of value to any audience member is the information at the end that
2590320	2594320	All In has broken up with Nick, and that is a negligible proportion of the video.
2594320	2599320	Nick- You know, I almost died two days ago, you guys know about this,
2599320	2603320	I almost died because I drank too much water, and I didn't want to go to the hospital
2603320	2609320	because I didn't want to get the IV, because it freaked me out.
2609320	2614320	Now, some of the emotions do feel quite legitimate in the video, which may soften my opinion a little,
2614320	2617320	but either way, it doesn't alter my stance on the existence of it,
2617320	2620320	and what it represents in the timeline of Mr Avocado.
2620320	2625320	Some of his audience also observe this unsuitability, though many others express sympathy for Nick,
2625320	2627320	which also proves my point.
2627320	2630320	I'll add that another comment appears to imply that this video was originally titled
2630320	2636320	Something Much More Inappropriate and Crats, but there were bigger fish to fry for Nick Ocado.
2636320	2640320	You see, a week later he uploads another emotional video on this topic.
2640320	2645320	Nick- Hey guys, it's me, I just came upstairs to the bedroom, I stand by my bed,
2645320	2653320	I turn on the camera, and I just, I need, I need, I need to get this off my chest,
2653320	2660320	I need to, you know, from my heart, from my heart, I'm a good person, I swear.
2660320	2665320	In this video, he once again becomes extremely upset, this time over the fact that some people were accusing Nick
2665320	2668320	and All In of faking this situation for views.
2668320	2670320	Now, this video is important for two primary reasons.
2670320	2674320	Nick exhibits a clear tendency to focus on these negative outlines,
2674320	2679320	in spite of some understandably frustrated viewers, many people had responded sympathetically to his previous video,
2679320	2683320	yet Nick magnifies this negative response, frames them with serious allegations,
2683320	2686320	and gets another 11 minutes of emotional content out of it.
2686320	2699320	Nick- People are so, so, so mean, every little thing I do, everything, people are trying to bring me down,
2699320	2702320	people are trying to tear me down, people are trying to knock me down to the ground,
2702320	2706320	and I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't take it anymore, I can't take it.
2706320	2711320	But what I do know is that what happened was not made up, it was not fake, it was not a show,
2711320	2721320	it's not all these things that people were saying, it was so real, it's so real that I see the scars.
2721320	2726320	Second, this more emotional content appeared to be a new precedent for how Nick wanted to treat, quote,
2726320	2730320	drama, and with this video, a significant share of his audience took issue with this,
2730320	2734320	stating that he should probably avoid projecting all these personal issues onto the internet.
2734320	2738320	This wasn't just one or two trolls, this was a decent number of his own audience,
2738320	2741320	saying that he needed to re-evaluate his approach to YouTube,
2741320	2744320	all the warning signs were there for the route that he was heading down.
2744320	2748320	However, what was most important was the creation of this new persona,
2748320	2752320	the new emotional, irrational, dramatic persona,
2752320	2758320	and one which could pretty much take on any narrative at any point, it was a chameleon.
2758320	2761320	This was a turning point for me, whether the videos were sincere or not,
2761320	2765320	they demonstrated an unhealthy obsession with the worst of YouTube culture,
2765320	2770320	and his previous arguments about improved mental well-being were beginning to not quite look as sturdy
2770320	2772320	as they may have seemed at one point.
2772320	2776320	Many of his own audience were urging him to take a step back, and yet he did not.
2776320	2780320	In fact, it was quite the contrary.
2789320	2796320	As said, Nick left the vegan lifestyle behind for the sake of his mental and physical health,
2796320	2799320	and if a person wants to do that, then it is valid.
2799320	2803320	However, as we've observed, his non-vegan diet has left a lot to be desired,
2803320	2805320	the YouTube environment didn't seem to be aiding him,
2805320	2808320	and only a couple days after his serious allegations video,
2808320	2812320	he decides to post more content documenting his additional health struggles,
2812320	2814320	but this time, it was physical.
2815320	2821320	I was so healthy. I had rice, and beans, and fish, and vegetables,
2821320	2825320	because I took a day off. The day before that, I had grilled cheese.
2825320	2828320	Oh my gosh. It's like as if I woke up out of a dream.
2828320	2832320	In a video called I'm Getting Fat and I Don't Know Why,
2832320	2836320	he observes that he's getting fat, and doesn't know why.
2836320	2841320	This is the first real sign of what would probably become a more satirical side of Nick's content,
2841320	2845320	but maybe people did not recognise that due to their familiarity with his previous work.
2845320	2848320	However, in this video, he rebuts people by stating that
2848320	2851320	he thinks that most of his weight has been gained rather suddenly,
2851320	2854320	and thus not really correlating with his dietary pattern.
2854320	2856320	For a night, you know, everyone told me,
2856320	2859320	oh, when you would change your diet, you would get OPs.
2859320	2862320	I stayed the same for months. It's been three months now.
2862320	2868320	But it's like all of a sudden, this week, I'm noticing in my face.
2868320	2871320	However, I can't really say I agree.
2871320	2876320	I think over the past few months, you can observe some gradual weight gain in the videos in the thumbnails.
2876320	2879320	A lot of the time, this can be kinda hard to observe as he sat down,
2879320	2883320	but if you compared a video from early 2017 to late 2016,
2883320	2885320	then you could probably observe some differences.
2885320	2888320	Now, if you follow his wardrobe choices such as shirts,
2888320	2892320	the most rapid change definitely seems somewhat recent at this point,
2892320	2897320	nothing irreversible, but something about his reflection didn't seem to instil confidence.
2897320	2904320	I have a fast metabolism. I work out three times a week. I eat plenty of fiber.
2904320	2908320	Working out three times a week and a fast metabolism isn't going to offset heavy consumption.
2908320	2912320	It might help you maintain some level of fitness and may slow weight gain,
2912320	2914320	but it's not going to prevent you from gaining at all.
2914320	2919320	As a side note, metabolism is not aided by devouring large amounts in one sitting
2919320	2921320	alongside long intervals between meals.
2921320	2924320	Now, this doesn't mean that stress cannot contribute to weight gain.
2924320	2927320	There are plenty of ways that stress can affect one's health,
2927320	2929320	and I'm more than happy to attest to that,
2929320	2932320	but Nick must have known it was not the sole contributor,
2932320	2934320	and that there were other more long-term factors at play.
2934320	2938320	Nonetheless, he still stood his ground on his mental states.
2938320	2941320	I feel a lot better mentally.
2941320	2948320	Like, honestly, this eating more food groups has really, really helped my mental health.
2948320	2950320	It has helped everything.
2951320	2956320	But then now, this comes out of nowhere.
2956320	2959320	In the video, he begs people to tell him what he should do,
2959320	2961320	before answering his own question.
2961320	2963320	No, not doing that.
2963320	2969320	So what's a healthy diet? What do I eat?
2969320	2971320	I need to get healthier. I'm ready to get healthier.
2971320	2973320	These muk mums are going to be the death of me.
2973320	2976320	Next day, he posts another video, this time 20 minutes long,
2976320	2978320	with the same sort of message.
2978320	2980320	He's been gaining weight, and he doesn't know what to do.
2980320	2983320	Next to some other pretty deranged quotes in this video,
2983320	2986320	he does utter a few rather iconic lines.
2986320	2992320	That's not the case, because literally, I've been eating that stuff
2992320	2996320	for like three months straight, and I've looked and weighed the same.
2996320	2998320	It's just this weight.
2998320	3001320	I don't know if it's stress levels, because of the thing between me and Orlin.
3001320	3005320	Maybe this is all water weight.
3005320	3009320	I'm holding on to water weight, because of my stress.
3009320	3013320	You know, going to get married, and going back home.
3013320	3017320	Water weight, which would inevitably become one of his signature memes,
3017320	3022320	basically this comic scapegoat for his weight gain, and merch you can buy.
3022320	3026320	So as noted in this series of videos, he observed he needed to make a change.
3026320	3028320	What was his next move?
3028320	3031320	Well, to make a bacon, chips, and cheesy pasta mukbang,
3031320	3034320	but his next video has him going vegan.
3034320	3037320	Hi, little sloths. Good evening.
3037320	3039320	I'm coming to you from my house.
3039320	3043320	You guys, so I decided I'm going to go vegan for today.
3043320	3047320	Today has been, you know, I have been very strict with my diet lately,
3047320	3051320	and I decided to just, I do a lot of fun mukbangs, junk food mukbangs,
3051320	3054320	fried food mukbangs, Cheetos, and everything in between.
3054320	3057320	But off camera is this.
3057320	3059320	This is what I eat all the time.
3059320	3060320	You guys see me on Snapchat.
3060320	3062320	You guys see all the fruit and all the vegetables,
3062320	3063320	and I decided to share it with you.
3063320	3065320	Talk about a bait and switch.
3065320	3068320	This was then followed by a 10,000 calorie challenge,
3068320	3070320	more and more mukbangs.
3070320	3072320	Oh, and a video called Why We Broke Up,
3072320	3076320	recording the bon vivant time where Nick slept with 12 people
3076320	3078320	and gave Orlin an STD.
3078320	3081320	Well, we took a break from each other, and I stayed here in Columbia,
3081320	3083320	and Nick went on a trip.
3083320	3087320	Nick went to the US first, and then to London, and then to Asia.
3087320	3091320	Well, the first thing that you did in Florida was,
3091320	3095320	he actually cheated on me with someone in Florida
3095320	3098320	a day or two after you arrived in Florida, right?
3098320	3100320	Yeah.
3100320	3103320	Oh, my heart!
3103320	3105320	You double dipped, and you had a mutual friend.
3105320	3107320	There was like four or five in DC.
3107320	3108320	Four or five, yeah.
3108320	3111320	Drew was like, whoa!
3111320	3112320	Okay, there was.
3112320	3113320	Oh, God.
3114320	3117320	You tried to get two in London, but it didn't work out.
3117320	3118320	No.
3118320	3120320	You tried to do one in Pennsylvania, two at our friend's house,
3120320	3121320	and it also didn't work out.
3121320	3123320	A friend's house, who's what?
3123320	3124320	Our friend.
3124320	3129320	Well, when he came back, he brought me a bug, a little bugger.
3129320	3130320	Brought a bug.
3130320	3133320	He brought me a bug.
3133320	3136320	It wasn't a really bad bug, but it was a bug.
3136320	3137320	Well, we were afraid.
3137320	3138320	We were very afraid.
3138320	3139320	It was a gross bug.
3139320	3142320	I literally felt, you guys, like my world was coming to an end.
3142320	3148320	It's one thing to take breaks.
3148320	3150320	It's one thing to break up.
3150320	3151320	It's one thing to test waters.
3151320	3154320	It's one thing to have affairs, but it's another thing to get a bug.
3154320	3155320	Oh, yeah?
3155320	3158320	That could possibly end your life early.
3158320	3167320	And for me to think about giving that to you was terrible.
3167320	3170320	This happened around 10 months ago, and they both claim they've moved on,
3170320	3175320	but it's certainly a strange upload, which many found wasn't the most flattering to Nick's image,
3175320	3180320	especially considering the claim that All In is believed to be suffering from an autoimmune illness.
3180320	3184320	This pattern of mukbangs interspersed with more personal videos persisted,
3184320	3188320	including two where he has a swollen eye, and is too afraid to go to hospital.
3188320	3194320	Doctors, and just to set the grounds of how intense my phobia is,
3194320	3197320	just getting my blood pressure taken, I always go unconscious.
3197320	3200320	I pass out, and it almost looks like a seizure.
3200320	3201320	I start shaking.
3201320	3202320	It's a phobia.
3202320	3206320	I was diagnosed when I was a child, and it's not just blood pressure.
3206320	3211320	It's like when I get my hair cut, anything with knives or sharp things,
3211320	3214320	that's one reason that I shouldn't really be doing much kitchen stuff,
3214320	3217320	but especially like shots, IVs.
3217320	3218320	Oh, my gosh.
3218320	3220320	I remember one time I had to get an IV, a blood drawn,
3220320	3224320	and I passed out twice, twice before they could even do it,
3224320	3227320	and I broke the lady's chair at the clinic in Washington DC.
3227320	3230320	Spoiler alert, he ends up going to the hospital,
3230320	3234320	and also went to the hospital a couple months later after his pet sloth bit his finger.
3234320	3238320	There's a few more awkward videos, it's just far too much on show,
3238320	3240320	and ultimately, it does him more harm than good.
3240320	3244320	He'll go from crying copiously about a horrible day in one video,
3244320	3247320	to rocking on up to the heart attack grill with hungry fat chick,
3247320	3250320	and getting free food because she's over 350 pounds,
3250320	3253320	not long after voicing weight concerns,
3253320	3255320	and it doesn't get better.
3262320	3264320	It's just a bit late for that, mate.
3264320	3268320	At this point, it should be clear that what was once this reason persona
3268320	3272320	attempting to articulate why he had distanced himself from a toxic community
3272320	3274320	had augmented into this caricature.
3274320	3277320	He can no longer really justify his previous position,
3277320	3281320	so whatever reason behind it just threw it out the window completely,
3281320	3284320	and turned it into a form of entertainment,
3284320	3287320	and the behaviour only descended further from here.
3287320	3291320	Now, the purpose of this video isn't going to be focusing on his weight,
3291320	3295320	as I feel like his weight gain is more a side effect of his behaviour.
3295320	3298320	As noted, someone can be the way they want to be,
3298320	3302320	but when they're in a state of denial, not just with this, but with many other things,
3302320	3304320	and they project those narratives to their audience,
3304320	3307320	it's not constructive to themselves or those around them,
3307320	3309320	even if they may see it as a lampoon.
3309320	3311320	It's about the content.
3311320	3315320	This stuff played up ridiculously in the moment to carry a much more dramatic heft
3315320	3319320	than it has any right to, and being forgotten by the next video.
3319320	3321320	This is the epitome of drama.
3321320	3323320	It was hard to watch, and because of Nick's approach,
3323320	3328320	it ultimately diminished the impact of said videos to all but the most ardent supporters.
3328320	3333320	If the drama itself wasn't hugely exaggerated, it was often precipitated by his own actions,
3333320	3336320	such as the deportation video, a sad situation,
3336320	3340320	but he provoked the problem by overstaying his tourist visa by 70 days,
3340320	3344320	so we need to have multiple videos of him just bawling his eyes out
3344320	3348320	and making statements that are just plain daft, and here are a few.
3348320	3351320	My husband, and this is my family, this is my apartment,
3351320	3354320	these are my belongings, this is my table.
3354320	3357320	I'll tell you, you're not going to see Mr. Noodle ever again,
3357320	3359320	you're not going to see Orlan ever again.
3362320	3363320	So what?
3364320	3366320	Who cares?
3366320	3367320	Do you care?
3370320	3371320	A grocery store.
3371320	3373320	We're on our way to the airport.
3373320	3375320	What do you think I'm hiding right now?
3376320	3378320	So that was a fun ride.
3378320	3382320	And when I use a Tyler the Creator clip, you know I'm at the end of my tether.
3382320	3386320	The truth is, with this content, one thing they all had in common
3386320	3390320	is that they were designed to provoke, and provoke they often did.
3391320	3396320	There was one more piece, the portrait of Nikocado Avocado.
3414320	3416320	2018 is beginning.
3416320	3420320	Nikocado Avocado is deep into his regression.
3420320	3423320	I could detail every instant he covers in his videos,
3423320	3428320	but as noted, the commodification of this content rendered most of the drama redundant,
3428320	3432320	so I'm just going to throw out a brief compilation of some nice highlights.
3436320	3438320	There's some youtubes out there that every time I go to their videos
3438320	3444320	they just cover with such cruelty, such cruelty by other human beings.
3444320	3446320	Don't you realize that's a real person behind the camera
3446320	3448320	trying their hardest every day to make you happy?
3448320	3452320	He passed out on the floor, and we're waiting for you guys to know
3452320	3455320	that he's going to go get a rabies vaccine.
3455320	3461320	Oh, my head hurts so bad. I feel like I'm being everywhere.
3461320	3464320	It's so uncomfortable. It hurts to just be alive.
3466320	3469320	The possibility is that I have pre-diabetes.
3469320	3471320	I'm pre-diabetic or I have diabetes.
3471320	3476320	I have hypertension. I could have high blood pressure.
3476320	3478320	I don't know. I don't know.
3489320	3493320	I'm not crazy. I swear. I'm not crazy. It's just so beautiful.
3495320	3498320	Essentially, I am being forced to leave.
3498320	3500320	The 25th is when my visa expires.
3504320	3508320	I want to apologize for offending anybody when I made the statement,
3508320	3509320	I hate the third world.
3511320	3514320	I just, I need someone to talk to.
3518320	3520320	Remember back in, what was it, March, the police framed me.
3520320	3523320	They put bullets in my suitcase. I was bribed by the government.
3523320	3526320	I almost got stabbed in Las Vegas.
3529320	3534320	I'm proud of hate. I got on my video with Orlin.
3534320	3541320	The volcano fire noodles is just unacceptable.
3542320	3544320	It's just one thing after another with me.
3544320	3549320	I'm leaving to get deported and we're having Domino's pizza.
3552320	3554320	So kind.
3555320	3561320	I'm telling you, I miss him so much. I really miss him.
3565320	3568320	And now I'm married to that person.
3571320	3577320	This content was embarrassing to watch, and probably even more uncomfortable if you had the displeasure of being associated with it.
3577320	3582320	It ultimately culminates in a series of videos where Orlin allegedly breaks up with Nick over Instagram.
3582320	3586320	This causes Nick to upload multiple emotional Instagram posts and go full Joker mode on his channel.
3586320	3591320	Can I just say, I am not having it today.
3591320	3593320	I am not having it today.
3593320	3601320	Today, Missy Two Shoes, you people on my Instagram, first of all, it is a privilege.
3601320	3606320	P-R-I-V-E-L-E-G. Privilege to be there.
3606320	3609320	Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye.
3609320	3615320	This persisted over the following year with many new developments, including break ups, new dates, Nick dragging Orlin's reputation,
3615320	3617320	and then trying to rescue it himself.
3617320	3624320	Now, as bizarre as this turn of events is, it's completely in line with the behaviour observed, so I don't really have too much to add here.
3624320	3628320	He exploits previous situations, focuses in on the negative, acts over emotional,
3628320	3631320	contradicts himself massively in the space of a couple videos.
3631320	3637320	These are all behaviours we've covered, no, in this part we're going to analyse a new fast at the surface later on,
3637320	3639320	but to do that, I need to set the scene.
3639320	3645320	It's 2018, Mukbang content is in full swing, Nick had been experiencing constant growth,
3645320	3651320	however, it's likely that with the degree of drama he immersed himself in, he had considerable audience turnover.
3651320	3654320	By 2019, that was going to change.
3654320	3658320	What do I mean? Nick has been a drama queen for the majority of his YouTube career,
3658320	3664320	but when Nick created drama within his own personal life, it only typically had negative implications for himself,
3664320	3669320	and perhaps Orlin. He may have gained a bit of attention here and there, but many viewers objected to this content.
3669320	3675320	In fact, even when the drama was about other people, there was very little to gain because there was no solid community
3675320	3677320	to rally behind the creator.
3677320	3682320	Nick hadn't been involved in any serious creator squabbles, but he definitely exhibited the potential to be.
3682320	3687320	The first prerequisite for such an instigatorary personality is the ability to be dramatic.
3687320	3690320	Now, we all know that Nick has that in spades.
3690320	3696320	The second prerequisite is the ability to call out people, people who often you may have a pre-existing relationship with.
3696320	3702320	For this, I want to briefly take you back to 2017, where Nick made a video called
3702320	3706320	I'm Fed Up Exposing Fake Mean YouTubers.
3706320	3712320	I have so much proof on my phone, she knows exactly who she is, and the other one,
3712320	3716320	I'm not even gonna talk about this, I'm not gonna give her attention, I don't wanna give any of them attention.
3716320	3721320	I have had it up to here, though. She's so disgusting. Girl, no.
3721320	3727320	So she can't return my emails, she can't return my snaps, she can't return my Twitter, she can't return my Instagram,
3727320	3733320	she can't even, like, have a conversation with me for months and months and months and months and months and months and months,
3733320	3738320	but she has the time, five minutes after my video gets published, to advertise herself,
3738320	3744320	everyone look at my clothes, everyone look at my new boyfriend, everyone, just now, get lost.
3744320	3751320	This video is a rather passionate rant towards an unspecified individual that many assume to be another creator by the name of Trisha Paytas.
3751320	3755320	Now, Trisha Paytas is an exceptionally controversial character by her own right,
3755320	3759320	and therefore, it's likely that many may have shared negative experiences with her,
3759320	3765320	but Nick doesn't explicitly name her, and this video ends up being a rather minor entry into his exhaustive catalogue.
3765320	3770320	So this leads us to the third and final prerequisite, the ability to name them.
3770320	3778320	Now, Nick hadn't made any explicit exposes on people, so creators who work with him in the near future could be forgiven in their ignorance,
3778320	3783320	but if you had been paying attention in 2018, you would have perhaps spotted a combative streak.
3783320	3788320	She wasn't looking for recognition, she's not looking for a shoutout on like divine munchies,
3788320	3796320	not looking for clouds and subscribers and everyone to be like, she just wasn't asking to use me or to be on my channel,
3796320	3799320	she just was receptive to help me.
3799320	3807320	And no, it's so funny, divine munchies pretends that she's like, hello, my friends, we are here on the earth,
3807320	3814320	I don't eat animals, and you shouldn't either, even though I ate it five months, you know, for a couple months to make money and get suns,
3814320	3819320	but no, no, no, now I'll tell you why, I am transparent, I am genuine.
3819320	3823320	The people that act like that are usually the complete opposite.
3823320	3828320	This was a clip from his two hour extravaganza with Asian KFC,
3828320	3831320	where he reveals that someone in the community is being rather fake.
3831320	3835320	This person was a creator by the name of StarsDivineMunchies.
3844320	3851320	StarsDivineMunchies was another mukbang creator, in 2018, she became one of the first recipients of Nick's new taste for drama.
3851320	3857320	Clearly tired by all the conflict in his personal life, he decided to drum up some new complaints about this individual.
3857320	3862320	Now, StarsDivineMunchies was not a completely unproblematic creator by mukbang standards,
3862320	3866320	however, in a now deleted response video only documented by a few other creators,
3866320	3869320	she seemed quite concise in how she felt about Nick.
3869320	3875320	We will now observe parts of this video through the perspective of the legendary creator HowToCameron.
3875320	3883320	I was never trying to share anything that you hadn't already shared to hundreds of thousands of people online.
3883320	3892320	So it wasn't like I was sharing some secret information, I was literally sharing what you had posted about on Twitter,
3892320	3895320	what you had shared in your mukbang videos.
3895320	3903320	I thought your YouTube manager was the one who told you that mukbang videos were getting demonetized.
3903320	3910320	So why would I think me sharing this with them would reflect bad on you?
3910320	3914320	Now you're trying to talk to me now, buttering me up, trying to talk to me.
3914320	3918320	I wasn't trying to talk to you or butter you up trying to talk to you.
3918320	3923320	This situation was provoked because Nick had tweeted concerns about mukbang content being demonetized,
3923320	3928320	and Divine Munchies had disparaged this claim after consulting another YouTube representative.
3928320	3933320	It then led to a rather confusing situation where Divine Munchies alleges that Nick proposed a collab,
3933320	3938320	but she had to decline last minute because she was ill, which is what led Nick to making a video alleging
3938320	3942320	that she was the person who proposed the collab, and talking various amounts of smack as well,
3942320	3947320	including the rather strong claim that Divine Munchies was attempting to have Nick's channel removed.
3949320	3954320	And Divine Munchies, that's her character, which I've been trying to point out for a long time,
3955320	3959320	and all that other shit, these are their characters.
3959320	3963320	Divine Munchies made a response to clear up Nick's alleged disinformation,
3963320	3966320	and as observed, to present her version of events.
3966320	3972320	Nick didn't take this well, and decided to make some additional, rather angry Instagram posts about her.
3972320	3977320	Now if you go to her video, I have this thing which is like an analytical thing.
3977320	3980320	These are the tags that she used.
3980320	3983320	Nikocado Avocado Fat.
3985320	3991320	In this video, she paints the stage from the get-go as I don't have any ill things to say about him,
3991320	3996320	I'm not going to name call him, I would never do what he did and call me names, you know,
3996320	3999320	passive aggressive stuff, being manipulative.
3999320	4005320	Because, I don't know if you know, but as a YouTuber, you get to link your video to key, you know, searches.
4005320	4011320	She's trying to get view rate and clicks off of me based on people attacking my weight,
4011320	4014320	people that have looked up Nikocado Fat videos that are hateful.
4014320	4019320	She'll turn on the camera and be like, oh yeah, I don't mean to call anyone names, I would never stoop down to his level,
4019320	4021320	oh I don't know why he would say such a thing.
4021320	4024320	It's like, because I know how you are, bitch, I know how you are.
4024320	4029320	You're going to come across on camera and be one way, but then go off camera and write out Nikocado's fat.
4029320	4034320	Now I'd say this would be a valid counterpoint if she'd actively typed out the tags herself,
4034320	4040320	but in the Instagram post, you can see the fat tag is amongst many other related tags that don't entirely connect with the video,
4040320	4045320	and although perhaps moderately distasteful, it probably means she just mass added a load of tags,
4045320	4050320	perhaps using a similar program to the one you're showing tags on, because many of them have that feature.
4050320	4055320	However, as we'll find out, Nik is quite interested in video tags.
4056320	4070320	He also says this, which I found confusing, because he was the one who brought it up in the video,
4070320	4074320	and although you could say that Divine making a response video in the first place was an overreaction,
4074320	4079320	you can't act surprised that part of her response is responding to what you said.
4079320	4083320	Now these are only fragments of the drama, there was other content too which is untraceable,
4083320	4086320	so it's hard to take too many character inferences.
4086320	4091320	What it does tell us is that Nik was gradually immersing himself in more drama and call out culture
4091320	4095320	as he became more involved in the community, and he certainly wasn't afraid to throw some shade.
4095320	4101320	But throwing shade was one thing, and he was ready to step it up a whole new level.
4101320	4104320	But before we go into that, I wanted to say a quick side note.
4104320	4109320	Where the hell is his nipple? Another question that will never be answered.
4110320	4114320	It's quite clear that Nik is an inherently dramatic person,
4114320	4119320	but drama only really exists on a continual basis in communities where such a culture is supported.
4119320	4121320	Mukbang is one of those cultures.
4128320	4133320	Why is that? Well firstly because it coasts on a more intimate personal basis, rather than core creativity.
4133320	4136320	This doesn't mean that Mukbangs can't be creative, many of them are,
4136320	4141320	but Mukbang content will always include the subject of the video interacting with the audience on a personal basis,
4141320	4145320	talking about their week, and if their week involves some other person being a twat,
4145320	4150320	then they may well wish to tell you about that person, especially if it means spicy tea.
4150320	4154320	Secondly, because many audiences of such creators seem highly receptive to drama.
4154320	4158320	The beauty community, for example, is another community fairly renowned for its high-stakes scandal,
4158320	4161320	and it has many creators who occasionally partake in Mukbangs,
4161320	4165320	leading to audience overlap in the more dedicated Mukbang community.
4165320	4170320	This also means commentary overlap, and it wouldn't surprise you to see various YouTube compilation channels
4170320	4174320	set up to mock and parody the worst moments of Mukbang creators,
4174320	4177320	much akin to the corresponding beauty community compilation channels.
4177320	4180320	Which conveniently segues us to our next situation.
4180320	4186320	Here's a fun little question, how do you make someone with very little credibility seem credible?
4186320	4190320	It's a difficult job, and Nikocado Avocado had his work cut out.
4190320	4195320	This dude had rolled his reputation through the mud at this point, like a Mukbang mux.
4197320	4203320	However, there is a rather simple answer, find someone with even less credibility, and get to work.
4211320	4214320	Let's introduce someone by the name of Veronica Wang then.
4214320	4219320	Veronica Wang is also a Mukbang creator, she, like many Mukbang creators, enjoys a good meal,
4219320	4224320	but has a bit of a habit of focusing on the negative. In this instance, the negative encompassed compilations
4224320	4229320	made by a channel called Shookbang. This content has also mostly been removed from the internet,
4229320	4233320	though it was documented fairly comprehensively in a video by Spill.
4233320	4248320	I think that's more passive aggressive than appreciative to be honest.
4248320	4253320	But that aside, after a couple videos, Veronica uploaded her own parody compilation,
4253320	4257320	whose undertone conveyed one of hurt at people who were making these.
4257320	4262320	After not receiving the desired response, she decided to copyright strike two of Shookbang's videos.
4262320	4266320	Shookbang responded by uploading an exposé on Veronica, which is where Nick comes in.
4266320	4272320	He leaves the comments criticizing Veronica's behaviour. All in all, it seems relatively empathetic to Shookbang's
4272320	4276320	predicaments. Veronica continues to dig herself a hole with rather weak statements,
4276320	4283320	and then another channel, Sass ASMR, decides to deal with an additional copyright strike on Shookbang's channel.
4283320	4286320	This meant that Shookbang had three strikes and was set for termination.
4287320	4292320	Enter unlikely hero, Nikocado Avocado, who Shookbang contacted with their plights.
4292320	4297320	Following multiple email exchanges, Nick decided to make a video of his own discussing the situation
4297320	4301320	on his Nikocado Avocado 2 channel, the channel which used to be All In's.
4301320	4306320	Hi guys, it's Nikocado Avocado, welcome to my new Mukbang channel, Nikocado 2, you're on it,
4306320	4310320	consider subscribing if you haven't done so, but it doesn't matter, cause today we have a lot to talk about.
4311320	4316320	I woke up to some juicy tea, oh my gosh, I even got a tea for the thumbnail, yes I did.
4321320	4323320	Nick, edit that out, no one wants to see that.
4323320	4327320	This is a 40 minute video, but once again, it's not entirely unreasonable.
4327320	4332320	He stands up for Shookbang and discusses fair use, though he does assert the somewhat inaccurate narrative
4332320	4335320	that Veronica's copyright claims were quote, basically illegal.
4335320	4340320	So this is the issue, another Mukbanger took her clip and reacted to it, changed it around,
4340320	4343320	made his own little story out of it in a very nice way.
4343320	4350320	She flagged it as copyright, which was a lie, which is illegal basically, it's basically illegal,
4350320	4353320	I mean let's just be real here, and you can't say that it infringes your rights,
4353320	4356320	when in actuality, it falls under the fair use law.
4356320	4363320	She used that copyright complaint system as grounds to strike down a channel that she just agreed with
4363320	4365320	on the premise of a lie.
4365320	4369320	The claims themselves may not be valid, and Veronica's motives were twisted
4369320	4372320	given the cyberbullying narrative, that's not copyright.
4372320	4376320	But unless someone submits a claim on a video that they know is fair use,
4376320	4378320	then it would be hard to prove illegality.
4378320	4381320	Particularly with these compilations, it is very unclear.
4381320	4385320	In my opinion, it is quite possible that Veronica became upset about these videos
4385320	4387320	and wanted to find a valid excuse to remove them.
4387320	4392320	It may be childish, but as long as she thought it was copyright infringement, then it's not illegal.
4392320	4397320	Someone could initiate a lawsuit against another person because of some deeply rooted personal grudge,
4397320	4399320	which has nothing to do with the legal system,
4399320	4403320	but there could still be legal grounds for wrongdoing on the other person's behalf.
4403320	4407320	However, I will say that Nick's points on this seem more reactive than manipulative.
4407320	4411320	Nick also eats a lot of noodles, which kind of interrupts the flow of the narrative,
4411320	4414320	but ho-hum, I'll take it over crying and eating pizza.
4414320	4417320	However, not too long after, Veronica flies off the handle,
4417320	4421320	publishing a rather unhinged Instagram rant, attacking Shookbang, audiences,
4421320	4425320	and anyone making commentary on the situation, Nick being no exception.
4425320	4428320	I do not regret copyright striking those videos.
4428320	4430320	I do not regret standing up for myself,
4430320	4436320	and I will not address anybody who is making titles about me from here on out for views,
4436320	4439320	because they're shady, they're liars,
4439320	4445320	and they're painting me to be this horrible person when I do nothing except spread love every single day of my life.
4445320	4451320	Everyone else can honestly, seriously, and I'm saying this wholeheartedly, can go f**k themselves.
4451320	4453320	I do not give a s**t, man.
4453320	4456320	Like, you're gonna try to twist my s**t around?
4456320	4458320	I have been nothing but loving and caring.
4458320	4462320	This was enough for Nick to upload two more videos, reinforcing his stance,
4462320	4465320	and there are a few other details here, but they are mostly superfluous to the focus.
4465320	4469320	Okay, it is a little bit crowded here, everyone out of the way, back to the topic.
4469320	4474320	At some point, Shookbang, Veronica, and Sass came to an out of YouTube settlement,
4474320	4476320	and the copyright strikes were removed,
4476320	4480320	but many, Nick included, felt that Shookbang took a far too apologetic position,
4480320	4485320	and that the main instigators in this situation did not face nearly enough consequences.
4485320	4489320	This is where Nick becomes more involved following a video uploaded by PewDiePie.
4489320	4494320	Veronica seemed to take the criticism well, which offended Nick as he felt he had delivered similar criticism.
4494320	4497320	There are multiple details regarding the resolution of this situation,
4497320	4500320	but they are mostly relating to Shookbang and fair use discourse,
4500320	4503320	which is fascinating, but not the focus of today.
4503320	4507320	So we'll cut to the video that Veronica uploads, and it's another bad one.
4507320	4512320	I think the first thing that I need to do for my subscribers, but not just my subscribers,
4512320	4517320	because recently, someone told me that this is the thing about being an influencer.
4517320	4522320	It's not about apologizing to that person, it's not about apologizing about the situation,
4522320	4524320	it's about directly apologizing to everyone.
4524320	4529320	After I was told this, I realized how wrong I was, and that I do owe everyone an apology.
4529320	4533320	So I want to make it very clear now that I am so sorry to everyone,
4533320	4536320	I am so sorry to Shookbang that they got their channel taken down,
4536320	4540320	I am so sorry that I even made a copyright strike to begin with.
4540320	4546320	I am so sorry, I made a huge mistake, I've made a bunch of mistakes in this situation.
4546320	4550320	Great, now we have a decent apology in the first two minutes out of the way,
4550320	4553320	we still have 25 minutes left, what else is there to say?
4553320	4555320	Did she cut the tea kettle?
4555320	4556320	Yeah, of course!
4559320	4564320	Okay, wait, wait, wait, I love how he chalks that up too, like, oh my god.
4564320	4566320	Is he always trying to make her look crazy?
4566320	4569320	You can really hold on to this, you can tell that this was affecting her,
4569320	4571320	because people were really attacking you.
4571320	4574320	You were very, like, how can you say, like, after seeing her live,
4574320	4579320	yeah, I don't believe what she's saying, this is fake, like, what are you talking about?
4580320	4586320	It's kind of funny, like, how he chalks it up, because it makes you look certified, like, now.
4586320	4587320	I know!
4590320	4595320	Her sitting down with her friends, going after Nick in such a disorganised way,
4595320	4597320	was an exceptionally strange response,
4597320	4600320	because not only does it provide the impression of unnecessary dog-piling,
4600320	4604320	it's lack of structure undermines whatever weight it may carry,
4604320	4606320	or additional evidence it may have to offer,
4606320	4611320	and it wasn't like there was nothing there, it was just a barren wasteland to find it,
4611320	4616320	and this allowed Nick to move in fairly clinically, providing a cohesive wall of rhetoric.
4616320	4619320	And yes, I put her most dramatic parts in the beginning of my videos,
4619320	4623320	instead of focusing on the premise, instead of focusing on the principle,
4623320	4626320	instead of backing up her statements with evidence,
4626320	4629320	instead of showing us how she lied or did not lie,
4629320	4631320	instead of apologising to everybody.
4631320	4634320	Now this is word porn for the verbose commentator,
4634320	4636320	but what was really behind that language?
4649320	4653320	One thing that seems quite clear is that Nick is not lacking in intelligence,
4653320	4656320	his responses were well-formulated and maintained a consistent narrative.
4656320	4659320	Veronica, on the other hand, decided to make a call-out video,
4659320	4664320	primarily aimed at Nikocado Avocado and marketed it as an apology video,
4664320	4669320	which is such a terrible idea that everyone just assumed she'd learned absolutely nothing from the entire situation.
4669320	4675320	Here's a scenario that caused a lot of upset, and she's just cavorting with her mates like a legitimate sociopath.
4680320	4683320	Make no mistake, Nick deconstructed her on many fronts,
4683320	4686320	however there were a few details which I found rather curious.
4686320	4690320	Nick frames this video as an extensive direct response to everything Veronica says about him,
4690320	4693320	and mostly he does a good job of responding,
4693320	4696320	but one of the details he purposely cuts out is this whole screenshot,
4696320	4701320	which he would have undoubtedly encountered while responding to Veronica's counter-allegations.
4701320	4704320	It only appears when Veronica cuts it over herself talking.
4704320	4708320	And so he has just done so much that he is claiming that I am,
4708320	4713320	that he is completely guilty of all these things, consistent with his channel.
4714320	4718320	Excuse me, if we're going to speak about relative consistency, let's look at my past few years on YouTube.
4718320	4722320	Have I ever made a video like the one I made to you? No.
4722320	4725320	My consistency has been crying and eating. That's it.
4725320	4733320	This doesn't define my character, and it's very sad that someone who is like this feels like they need to portray who they are onto other people.
4733320	4738320	I did not talk about myself at all in any of my videos. How did I portray myself?
4738320	4742320	I'll take a quick moment to say that Nick manages to misinterpret Veronica's point,
4742320	4747320	stating that he hadn't talked about himself in his videos, but with the corresponding evidence,
4747320	4753320	Veronica's claim was clearly that Nick was projecting cynical character judgements based on his own actions,
4753320	4756320	not necessarily that he was talking about himself.
4756320	4759320	What were these actions? Well, let's talk about this picture.
4759320	4763320	This screenshot is from a gentleman by the name of Rainy Pachac.
4763320	4767320	Rainy Pachac, known as Symbiotic Solutions on YouTube, is a raw food vegan creator.
4767320	4771320	He knew Nick from when he was in the community, and didn't have the best experience with him.
4771320	4775320	In fact, some old posts paid clear testament to his feelings about Nick.
4775320	4779320	However, one of the interesting facts about their relationship is that at a certain point,
4779320	4785320	Nick copyright-striked one of Rainy's videos using a fake account, which he later admitted to be himself.
4785320	4790320	Now, this was a long time ago, and although completely hypocritical from a behavioural standpoint,
4790320	4795320	it's understandable that people can change, and Nick's narrative wasn't that she should be permanently ruined,
4795320	4799320	it was just that she should apologise, something that it seems Nick has done.
4799320	4804320	So why is this of interest? Well, because of the simple fact he glossed over it.
4804320	4809320	Which, given that he was desperately asking for some semblance of receipts, seems somewhat surprising.
4809320	4812320	Why did he dodge it? Well, he probably didn't want to address it,
4812320	4816320	but his own narrative preached forgiveness and owning up so we can all move forward.
4816320	4820320	If he admitted that he's made mistakes elsewhere, and then turned this point on its head
4820320	4825320	for why Veronica should own up to her mistakes, then it could have made his video even more effective.
4825320	4829320	I have a hunch for why he dodged it, but that will be revealed in due time.
4829320	4834320	Truth is, a lot of people didn't notice because Veronica's response was such a dumpster fire,
4834320	4838320	and more people actually watched Nick's response to Veronica than the original video.
4838320	4844320	Now, he does briefly mention the general notion of people dredging up his past, questioning their intent and validity,
4844320	4848320	but it ultimately feels slightly disingenuous given the specific example shown on screen,
4848320	4851320	and how it could on principle contradict his position.
4851320	4857320	Instead, Nick uses the fact that he's not going to descend into such mudslinging as a way to pedestal his stance,
4857320	4862320	before launching multiple ad hominems against the community that this person's complaint is from.
4862320	4866320	Why are you going to sit here and claim that I depicted you in a bad light,
4866320	4869320	that I'm attacking and bullying and slandering you,
4869320	4874320	when you're sitting here and entertaining all of these claims from people of the past?
4874320	4880320	He has just done so much that he is claiming that I am, that he is completely guilty of all these things.
4880320	4883320	All of these claims from people of the past.
4883320	4885320	Who are crawling up from the floorboards and saying,
4885320	4888320	Oh, Nikocado did this to me in the past.
4888320	4890320	Nikocado did this in the past.
4890320	4891320	And you're going to say, oh.
4891320	4892320	No!
4892320	4896320	Well, it must be true. Let me just stick it into my video. My apology.
4896320	4899320	I have gotten many emails about you.
4899320	4905320	I have had people reach out to me who have personally been affected and traumatized by what you've done to them.
4905320	4907320	Should I let the world know what you've done in your past?
4907320	4912320	Should I sit here and entertain all of these accusations from five years ago, ten years ago?
4912320	4913320	I didn't do that.
4913320	4915320	You want to sit here and say that I bullied and slandered you?
4915320	4917320	My videos were talking about the present.
4917320	4919320	I backed up my statements with evidence.
4919320	4923320	You making a video apologizing by bringing up all of these old conflicts,
4923320	4928320	which you have no idea what they entail, is what actual slander is.
4928320	4930320	Because you can't verify if they're true.
4930320	4934320	I'm not going to go into all of my past problems, just like I didn't go into all your past problems.
4934320	4938320	But I will just say for the record, some of these people reached out to you literally half a decade ago.
4938320	4944320	2013, 2014, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, literally over half a decade ago.
4944320	4950320	When I was a raw food vegan, I was blasted at all of these raw food groups.
4950320	4951320	I mean, you clearly don't watch me.
4951320	4955320	I have so many story times about how Orlin and I met in a cult.
4955320	4956320	Okay?
4956320	4958320	Cooking food denatures the food.
4958320	4960320	Cooking food is poison.
4960320	4962320	Dietary leukodygenesis.
4962320	4967320	A group of people who thought, if you cook your food, you are setting bad examples to society.
4967320	4971320	These people have had it out to get me ever since I stopped being vegan.
4971320	4974320	Since I eat dead animals now, I am seen as a murderer.
4974320	4976320	I am seen as having no compassion.
4976320	4979320	I am seen as unethical because I eat chicken.
4979320	4983320	Some of these people are taking it to the extreme because I cooked my food.
4983320	4987320	Not only can you not verify if those are true and accurate,
4987320	4991320	not only can you not verify if these people are just holding grudges against me,
4991320	4994320	but you're entertaining something you know nothing about.
4994320	4997320	You have no idea who you're speaking to.
4997320	5005320	You have no idea the type of intensity behind these people and their mission and their views.
5005320	5012320	And I guarantee, had you not had this problem with me, they would also see you as a murderer because you eat meat.
5012320	5015320	People are seeing this as an opportunity to make it about themselves
5015320	5020320	and to make it about past situations from years ago that has nothing to do with anything.
5020320	5023320	And you're entertaining that, and sticking it in your apology.
5024320	5029320	Side note, Nick tends to wrap his justifications in the Quoque fallacy a lot,
5029320	5032320	that I'll informally call the No You argument.
5032320	5036320	Veronica's claims are pretty baseless, so Nick looks fairly assured in his takedown,
5036320	5040320	but by logic and argumentation standards, it's not the best.
5040320	5044320	On top of this, Veronica Wang also includes content from Divine Munchies,
5044320	5047320	who brings up the specific point about Nick promoting the need for evidence,
5047320	5051320	and yet gleefully claiming she was trying to take his channel down with no evidence of his own,
5051320	5055320	it's also important to mention that he made that allegation less than a year before.
5055320	5059320	Nick, once again, doesn't show this or mention it at all.
5059320	5061320	He still did decimate Veronica Wang's arguments,
5061320	5066320	but for someone who conveys a message of such sincerity, these omissions seem rather calculated.
5066320	5071320	He had no problem being meticulous in going through the details when dealing with Veronica's issue,
5071320	5075320	but also had no problem making general and frankly somewhat inaccurate statements
5075320	5077320	about people who Veronica referenced in her video,
5077320	5081320	as well as saying that Veronica could not prove what those people were saying to be true,
5081320	5083320	which, honestly, she could have.
5083320	5087320	Now, Veronica didn't prove it because she's not very good at these sorts of videos,
5087320	5090320	but it wouldn't have been too much hassle to obtain verification,
5090320	5094320	especially the one where Nick literally has it in an upload on his own channel.
5094320	5098320	On top of this, Nick also left out any screenshots rebutting his points about legality,
5098320	5101320	although he does respond to it partly in the video.
5101320	5103320	Veronica's arguments were pretty weak on this front anyway,
5103320	5107320	and it didn't help that one of her friends suggested that US law didn't apply to them,
5107320	5109320	which Nick had a field day with,
5109320	5113320	before going on to claim that Veronica said it herself towards the end of the video.
5113320	5114320	Sneaky sneaky.
5114320	5119320	And if you were so smart, you would know that we live in Canada.
5119320	5122320	Like, US law doesn't apply to us, and it's different.
5122320	5125320	And that's not excusing Veronica just because she's Canadian or whatever,
5125320	5129320	because I know, like, Niko Kai, you're going to try and clock me for that.
5129320	5134320	But at the same, like, it's just that, like, you're talking out of your ass.
5134320	5138320	And if you were so smart, too.
5138320	5140320	So smart.
5140320	5143320	Or took the time to Google, rather than sitting here and enabling your friend,
5143320	5147320	your pal, you would also know that when you work for a company overseas,
5147320	5150320	you adhere to the laws of the country's origin.
5150320	5152320	I mean, I've traveled internationally a lot.
5152320	5154320	When in Rome, you act as the Romans.
5154320	5156320	I'm not claiming to be a lawyer.
5156320	5163320	Now, the only person who's claiming to have legal counsel from an attorney is Veronica.
5163320	5166320	Her legal advisor didn't tell her this.
5166320	5171320	When and where has she shown through her actions that she has owned up to anything?
5172320	5175320	That the U.S. law doesn't apply to her because she's Canadian.
5175320	5179320	There is no way that you would have removed the strike had I not brought light to it.
5179320	5184320	That you would have removed your strike had PewDiePie not exposed you to seven million people.
5184320	5188320	There is no way, because you still said U.S. law doesn't apply to you.
5188320	5193320	Veronica's ostensible approval of her friend's comments is part of her undoing here.
5193320	5197320	As Nik shows, if you don't have a good response, maybe best not to respond at all.
5197320	5199320	I never forced this person to do anything.
5199320	5202320	I told them if they were uncomfortable, they didn't have to do it.
5202320	5206320	I understand that the other YouTuber sass asked for an apology.
5206320	5208320	I even said that this person didn't have to apologize.
5208320	5213320	All I wanted was the facts written out, and that's it, for us to move on.
5213320	5216320	There were a few times where Nik seems to avoid responses and corrections,
5216320	5222320	such as Veronica's fully evidenced responses to the claim that she forced Shookban to apologize,
5222320	5226320	something that Nik doesn't address, despite it being part of those receipts he begged for.
5227320	5233320	One consistent narrative that Nik has always had is tearing people down to bring himself back up.
5233320	5239320	Instead of showing us receipts, you know, to back up your statements, to add validity to your words.
5239320	5243320	You did it real quick over here. Congrats getting into your college.
5243320	5245320	That took, what, two seconds? Screenshot, boom.
5245320	5248320	Why didn't you show us the receipts for the police report?
5248320	5250320	The receipts for your death threats.
5250320	5252320	Where are those receipts of the emails?
5252320	5259320	Supposedly, as you quoted, every mukbanger emailed you privately behind closed doors to say they were in support of you.
5259320	5260320	Let's see those receipts.
5260320	5262320	The receipts of your lawyer.
5262320	5264320	The receipts from SAS ASMR.
5264320	5268320	The receipts of the fair use law, which you still believe you did not break.
5268320	5272320	The receipts of your private messages with Shookbang, which I happen to have.
5272320	5280320	Instead of doing any of this, showing us evidence, she decided to use this as an opportunity to assassinate my character.
5281320	5287320	And yet because Nik's so confident, it easily offsets any counterpoints that can be brought against him.
5287320	5293320	It also conveys the message that you don't necessarily need the best points if you have the power of conviction,
5293320	5298320	a lesson that would turn out to be rather prophetic in more than one way.
5298320	5302320	This is a basic rundown of what happened here, but it does tell us the story.
5302320	5304320	Is there anything else of note?
5304320	5308320	Well, Veronica uploaded a video on the 4th of February generally talking about the drama again,
5308320	5311320	though honestly, it seems like she's ranting off the top of her head.
5312320	5319320	Like, people like to assume, like, everything that anyone has ever said to me about me has been an assumption.
5319320	5324320	This is like, everyone's like, oh, we hit you with facts, Veronica, facts, facts, facts, no.
5324320	5328320	You hit me with fucking assumptions. You hit me with a fucking opinion.
5328320	5332320	However, she made the fatal error of putting Nik's name in the tags,
5332320	5339320	leading to a 47 minute response video from Nik a month later, destroying her with facts and logic.
5339320	5343320	And for the record, this video is a passive aggressive attack on me.
5343320	5345320	And you want to know why? You have to look at the tags.
5345320	5348320	Who does she want this video to reach?
5348320	5351320	The audience of Nikocado Avocado, because she tagged me.
5351320	5356320	Nikocado and Veronica, as well as Nikocado exclusively.
5356320	5358320	They're in the tags. Here's the receipts.
5358320	5362320	So, please don't say I'm just trying to make this about myself. Trust me.
5362320	5364320	If she would have just said sorry, even privately, like,
5364320	5368320	I'm sorry for damaging your reputation and lying about you, I would move on too.
5368320	5373320	But here she is instigating and perpetuating drama by being mean
5373320	5376320	and being passive aggressive by sticking my name in the tag
5376320	5379320	so that this video gets recommended to Nikocado's followers.
5379320	5382320	The pattern that we tend to establish with these videos
5382320	5385320	is that if there's an opportunity to find a reason to respond,
5385320	5389320	Nik will make it. Obviously, it's his prerogative to respond to whatever he wants.
5389320	5392320	But the premise behind this one did feel a little weak,
5392320	5397320	especially given how Veronica's not partaking in the most scholarly discourse.
5397320	5401320	However, this was his fifth and final video on this specific matter.
5401320	5403320	Here's the tea, if you really want it.
5403320	5407320	Veronica's low effort videos were inevitably ripped apart by Nik
5407320	5410320	because she assassinated her own image and initiated drama
5410320	5413320	which allowed Nik to be invited in like a vampire.
5413320	5416320	However, there were cracks in the foundations of his rebuttals,
5416320	5419320	and yet no one, no one could have noticed at that point.
5419320	5423320	Veronica's video with her friends is probably one of the most insufferable smugfests,
5423320	5427320	and I have a grudging admiration that she still has it public on her channel.
5427320	5429320	With Veronica appropriately bodied,
5429320	5432320	Nik managed to obtain some status within the community,
5432320	5435320	and a fair few subscribers and new supporters.
5435320	5437320	These drama videos had obtained consistent views,
5437320	5439320	and allowed him to be taken seriously.
5439320	5442320	These new audiences weren't too familiar with his past antics
5442320	5445320	and became acquainted with a different Nikocado avocado,
5445320	5447320	although he did say this.
5447320	5451320	So he clearly wants to retain his current brand,
5451320	5454320	if that's what crying can be classified as.
5454320	5457320	But vampires don't tend to only have one victim,
5457320	5460320	and as the tea was spilled on more and more people,
5460320	5463320	he had his first boss battle in sight.
5463320	5465320	He's not a vampire,
5465320	5467320	he's a vampire,
5467320	5468320	he's a vampire,
5468320	5469320	he's a vampire,
5469320	5470320	he's a vampire,
5470320	5471320	he's a vampire,
5471320	5472320	he's a vampire,
5472320	5473320	he's a vampire,
5473320	5474320	he's a vampire,
5474320	5475320	he's a vampire,
5476320	5483320	etc.
5483320	5485320	Trisha Paytas
5485320	5490320	The amount of requests that I've had for a video on Trisha is quite astounding.
5490320	5494320	but then again, she is a rather astounding person,
5494320	5497320	and maybe, just maybe that time will come?
5497320	5501320	but for now, she is a necessary side character in this belated tale.
5501320	5507120	was one of the first popular western creators involved in promoting mukbang, and has sustained an interest
5507120	5514920	in the genre since her first upload. However, she also had a history with Nikocado Avocado, dating back to 2017,
5514920	5520760	when Trisha held a competition which involved covering a song from her album, and Nick decided to enter.
5520760	5536880	It's a fantastic performance, and Trisha left a very enthusiastic comment in response to this video,
5536880	5541160	and there were additional interactions between them on other social media platforms.
5541160	5547160	However, after this, all fell silent, but as noted earlier, many had assumed that the video where he calls out
5547160	5550480	fake people on social media was directed at her.
5550480	5578960	However, because the video was purposely vague, nothing really came of it,
5578960	5586120	but by 2019, he'd established himself in the community as a bit of a queenslayer, and now there was a formula for success,
5586120	5591880	he could apply it to others within the community, and his old adversary, Trisha Paytas, was the perfect target.
5591880	5596960	She was already controversial and widely hated for being rather problematic, and because of this it made people
5596960	5599840	more receptive to allegations regarding her behaviour.
5599840	5605720	Nick had also cracked the say for what people loved the most in exposed videos, that being receipts.
5605760	5611320	He had advertised them rather conspicuously in the last set of responses to Veronica Wang and SaaS ASMR,
5611320	5616640	which had been met with widespread support, so it only made sense that he included all the spicy receipts
5616640	5622400	if he wanted to take Trisha Paytas down for what she did to him, so he launched his attack.
5622680	5628680	We have to talk. What I'm gonna talk about happened at a point in my life where I was very...
5628680	5638640	...fronerable. I was very fragile in my emotions, and this is something that's plagued me for years.
5638640	5644320	His collective videos documenting the situation and what followed have obtained almost 5 million views between them,
5644320	5649360	and therefore, they're at least somewhat important. Now, admittedly, they probably don't have the greatest
5649400	5654280	influence because Trisha Paytas has a reputation for not being the most reliable person, however,
5654280	5659280	whether the person is good or bad, you are expected to be faithful to the information that you present,
5659280	5661520	and the conclusions that can be drawn.
5661520	5666800	Nick's rhetoric in this video is powerful, one of vulnerability and exploitation.
5666800	5668960	It's an Oscar-winning performance, really.
5669400	5675600	I haven't been able to move on. I haven't. And it's because I was really hurt.
5675600	5683600	I was mortified in front of thousands of people. I was made fun of. I don't even know why.
5683600	5688120	I don't know what I did to deserve this. I have no idea what I did wrong.
5688120	5694880	And I realized, after getting this video from Trisha, that I won't be able to move on until I let people know what happened
5694880	5698240	and what she did to me and how it made me feel.
5698280	5701840	But performance is the key word here, so I'll break it down.
5702320	5707080	So he goes into the backstory, explains the warrior competition, his motives, the tweets,
5707080	5709720	and then he reveals DMs between himself and Trisha.
5709720	5713560	These DMs show that although being initially interested in a collaboration,
5713560	5719040	and even committing to doing a shoot at some point, Trisha eventually did not follow up on this.
5719600	5723280	And then I said, Hi, I'm here. I'm in Hollywood. I brought you gifts. I can't wait.
5723520	5727360	Can't wait to see you. I hope everything's okay. And then two days goes by.
5727360	5731640	Each day, I'm like, Hi, is everything okay? Hi, did I do something wrong?
5732200	5736360	Hi, Trisha. I came to LA to see you, but I don't know how to get a hold of you. Is everything okay?
5736360	5740200	Next one says, If I did something wrong, can you let me know? I have gifts for me from Colombia.
5740200	5743520	Never got a response, and I figured I'm probably just being a dead bush now.
5743520	5747400	I stopped being vegan, so I filmed all these videos like my first Burger King burger,
5747400	5751560	my first McDonald's burger, my first pizza in like six years.
5752000	5757720	I had a great time. I was sad. I was very, very sad by this, but luckily I had things to distract me again.
5757720	5763440	I had to do the run anyways. Luckily, I had other people to clap with, so I was very, very hurt.
5763440	5766920	Um, but I got even more hurt after the trip, and you're gonna find out why.
5766920	5773040	This is rather unsporting behaviour, and did unfairly lead Nick on with the expectations of a collaboration,
5773040	5776720	before not providing him with any additional correspondence at all.
5776720	5779360	On top of this, when it was brought up in future streams,
5779360	5784720	she appeared to deny this version of events completely, despite the fact it was heavily evidence.
5784720	5790720	I was never going to. Like, I don't know. I was never going to. I wasn't gonna, like, collab, you know what I mean?
5790720	5795080	Like, I don't know where that came from. Yeah, I don't care for his videos or for his personality.
5795080	5801400	What Trisha Paytas did would have rightfully hurt Nick. If I was in his shoes, I would have been a tad upset too.
5801400	5805960	But honestly, this alone would have not been grounds for an exposed video, in my opinion.
5806000	5811000	She responded to a few messages regarding a meeting, and then went dark, and once again, not to defend her,
5811000	5816280	but if I was in Nick's shoes with a relatively famous creator who I literally just started talking to,
5816280	5822920	and who Nick literally acknowledges is incredibly busy and was in a tight spot, I would have definitely waited for further confirmation,
5822920	5827080	given that Trisha's own DMs clearly show she was uncertain of the plans.
5827080	5833880	Trisha Paytas is flaky, unreliable, and erratic. That's not news. Nick does acknowledge this though.
5834000	5838080	But in your video, you talked about getting closure and being upfront and being professional,
5838080	5843320	and I really appreciate if you give me a little closure too. Obviously, I don't know you and you don't know me,
5843320	5849800	so obviously, this is on a much lesser scale, which I understand. Then I was completely ignored. Then you unfollowed me.
5849800	5854600	Everyone keeps asking me to make a video saying what happened, your tweets, my tweets, our DMs, blah, blah, blah,
5854600	5859840	and I want you to know I don't want to do that to you. I never did, and I never will. Well, until now.
5860080	5864480	I hope that shows to you what my true intentions are, and hopefully that you can trust me.
5864480	5870840	But privately, can you just explain to me what I did wrong? Why you still haven't said anything to this day?
5870840	5876480	I'm just so confused. I was so excited that you asked to collab. I kept saying to myself,
5876480	5882480	what did I do wrong? Maybe I jumped the gun without getting extra confirmation. I'm sorry.
5882480	5886800	You said you were free in the schedule, and then even you said we should film Tuesday.
5886800	5891440	I bought the tickets right away. Maybe you changed your mind, or maybe someone told you something about me.
5891440	5895640	I don't know. Look, I'm not saying that I regret growing there. I actually met another YouTuber.
5895640	5900640	I made lots of videos. I'm not complaining. I'm not going to make exposing videos. I just want to know.
5900640	5906000	I would really appreciate it if you told me privately what happened on your end. Thank you, and I wish you a speedy recovery.
5906000	5911440	Nick had a bad experience, it's a shame, but in a rather long message attempting to confront Trisha,
5911480	5916800	he outwardly states that he doesn't intend to make an expose video. So what has changed since then?
5916800	5929000	She saw this message, instead of just telling me straight up, she took our DMs, edited out her messages to me,
5929000	5938600	cropped them out, deleted them, put my messages together, and then sent them all over the internet.
5938720	5944440	This is quite the allegation, what evidence is there to support it? Well, not much to be honest.
5944440	5950880	The DMs were released, this was true, but as Nick recognised in this message, there were people asking after the situation,
5950880	5957600	one of these individuals was Martin Lewis. Now, his upload is quite harsh on Nick's perspective due to some personal history
5957600	5963520	in the vegan community. However, the DMs he shows are in full chronological order with no editing,
5963560	5968960	the only content that was not passed on were the first interactions between them, and the final lengthy message,
5968960	5975040	which judging by the unread receipt shown in this video, was not sent at the time she passed on these screenshots.
5975040	5982080	In fact, if you had a keen eye, you would have noticed that in his DM, he mentions a situation transpiring with a gentleman named Sean,
5982080	5990680	Trisha's ex-boyfriend, where Trisha talks about closure in a video, this video being her response to Sean released on the 27th of February.
5990680	5997160	Trisha's ex-boyfriend, Sean, made a video saying what went down with me, where he gave the internet closure,
5997160	6007720	but still has yet to give me any closure, a real life human being, which he spent the past year of his life day in and day out with.
6007720	6014040	It's also important to note that a video uploaded by a creator by the name of Vegan Cheetah, who now goes by Charles Marlowe,
6014040	6019720	appears to include receipts as well. Now, I am not in possession of the video, and it does not appear to be archived,
6019760	6026880	I don't know all the exact details, but we can calculate it was released around mid February, around a month after Nick was meant to be meeting Trisha.
6026880	6033200	I know this because an old Reddit post which advertised this video is still updated on the 20th of February,
6033200	6038440	a week before Trisha's video response, which Nick references in his own message to her.
6038440	6043920	I did find a clip from the video in another upload which explains how this was brought up in his circle.
6043920	6052240	Now, I couldn't find a whole lot under that video that Trisha Paytas had uploaded, but this comment that was left on my video actually started a small thread.
6052240	6059200	Taylor said, yeah, something weird happened between them. She probably set them up like she does to other YouTubers,
6059200	6062840	but they're both whack jobs to be honest, so who gives a f***?
6062840	6069720	And then Nicki responded to Samantha by saying, I may be wrong, but did she not end up in the hospital around that time though?
6069720	6075840	Now, it's possible that Martin Lewis' video was released after Nick's DM, as it was the first of March,
6075840	6081120	though as we know, the DMs he'd received were prior to Nick's message, and in his video about the topic,
6081120	6084560	he shows his representation of Nick was pretty biased.
6084560	6092800	Trisha Paytas, Nikocado Avocado said that Trisha Paytas paid for his ticket to LA.
6092800	6095760	Automatically, I was like, oh my God, what did Nick do?
6095760	6101040	You know, you have a lot of people, not just one person and not just trolls,
6101040	6111960	but all these other people saying that Nikocado said that Trisha paid for him first class to fly to LA.
6111960	6117520	And at that time, I'm like, well, who's lying? Is it these people? Is it Nikocado's fans?
6117520	6121400	Or is it Nikocado? I messaged Trisha, I said to her,
6121400	6126440	Nick and I used to be best friends till I disconnected from him due to his lies and opportunist mentality.
6126440	6129320	Anyways, I'm doing a video on the situation between you and him.
6129320	6133640	Word on YouTube says you wanted to collaborate a mukbang with him.
6133640	6136480	He came to LA for you and you stood him up.
6136480	6140400	Well, anyways, let me know what happened. I have your back in this.
6140400	6148480	But if you did something wrong, own up to it, as you know what can happen with the drama these days.
6148480	6154240	Because of course, I assumed the worst because of my past with Nikocado Avocado,
6154240	6161040	and it's not just one incident, it's just multiple things, and things that even continue on to this day.
6161040	6163600	Like, he's lost a lot of friends, and there's a reason why.
6163600	6168480	With this in mind, we can portray the reality, and look into how it was twisted.
6170400	6182240	You can't follow Nick's timeline too much, because Nick has deleted a majority of his tweets,
6182240	6187840	relating to Trisha from around that time at least, despite leaving others up, not sure why he did that.
6187840	6193920	However, his framing that there were loads of people calling him a social climber on Twitter seems pretty unlikely,
6193920	6199760	and once again, I could find little evidence, given that his criticism came from such a small niche on YouTube.
6199920	6205200	In fact, if you look at Trisha's and Nikocado's joint mentions around that time, you'll see more negative
6205200	6210800	comments towards Trisha from Nick's fans, mostly in reference to the 2017 video he put out,
6210800	6213120	which many quickly assumed to be about Trisha.
6213120	6217840	Now, I mentioned this video earlier, which is allegedly in response to a supposedly deleted,
6217840	6221040	homophobic comment left by Trisha on one of Nick's videos.
6221040	6225600	Some of Nick's viewers claimed they had seen it, and captured it themselves, but there is no clear
6225600	6231440	record nor mention of it in Nick's all-spilling expose, which makes the more conspiratorial side
6231440	6236240	of me wonder if Nick was really back at it again with his fake accounts, as he had previously used
6236240	6238560	one to copyright claim our friend Rainey.
6238560	6243520	On top of this, Nick fails to mention the YouNow streams, or his deleted tweets about Trisha Paytas,
6243520	6246640	these ones being captured by an ardent supporter of his.
6246640	6251120	I don't know the exact reason he didn't mention these in his videos, but I assume it was to avoid
6251120	6256480	the perception that he had instigated the conflict in any way, and that he had remained silent.
6256480	6263600	This is something that's plagued me for years, what I'm gonna talk about, and if you have no idea
6263600	6268240	what's happened, and you've randomly found this video, or you know of me but don't really watch me,
6268240	6274080	I mean, I don't talk about this, I never have. I've alluded to it, and when I have alluded to it,
6274080	6277520	I've always said, we're not gonna discuss it, I had a great trip.
6277520	6283200	I will add that all recorded drama appeared to initiate in September after Trisha's YouNow streams,
6283200	6287440	but with all the deleted content, I can't comment on what happened for certain.
6287440	6292320	Now, looking at the receipts we can squander together, the precipitation of the situation may be
6292320	6297520	slightly different to what Mr Avocado presents. In his video, he states that he's been struggling
6297520	6299600	with escaping the vegan community.
6299760	6305440	Around this time, I had stopped being vegan. I had just made the announcement that I didn't
6305440	6309760	want to be vegan anymore, and for anyone who has been vegan, and they stopped as well, you know,
6309760	6315360	it's one of the hardest things to grapple. I mean, not like, oh, I did it for a week,
6315360	6320960	or I did it for a month, I mean, I did it for five years. My heart and soul into it. I was
6320960	6325040	one of those people that stood out with signs, meat is murder, outside of McDonald's. That's
6325040	6330160	how much it was my viewpoint. At every possible aspect, it was my life, and when I decided to stop,
6330880	6334320	I thought my world was crashing down. The majority of my audience at the time
6334960	6338720	was vegan. I had like 50,000 subscribers, all vegan.
6339600	6345120	And it's clear that some in the vegan community still harbored a level of resentment towards him.
6345120	6350400	Let me give you a little bit of background of Nikocado Avocado. Since I used to be friends
6350400	6357760	with him, I kind of know how he works. In my experience, in my opinion, he has been very
6357760	6365440	manipulative, you know, he has been very, he has a way of playing victim, and his audience are so
6365440	6369680	brainwashed that they really feel sorry for him. We're not friends anymore because he lied about
6369680	6376560	a lot of things. I used to be in a collab channel with him, and he just had the lamest excuse to
6377200	6382240	close the channel down, and there was a lot of other reasons behind it. A lot of lies,
6382800	6389280	playing victim, he was doing sneaky shit to make people assume something else in the comment
6389280	6394960	section. These aren't random drama channels who Trisha was DMing unprovoked, however. These were
6394960	6400160	people with already existent drama with Nikocado Avocado, probably looking for other ways to
6400160	6405440	tarnish his reputation. Vegan Cheetah had already uploaded multiple videos on Nikocado Avocado,
6405440	6410080	Martin Lewis was more drama oriented in general, but still states he had previous baggage with
6410080	6415280	the dude. But these videos weren't overwhelmingly popular, and Trisha's DMs didn't really reveal
6415280	6420240	a narrative without the vegan creators providing their insight. Should Trisha have responded to
6420240	6425200	Nik instead of the drama channels? For sure, but this wasn't malice prepense, it was completely
6425200	6429680	in line with Trisha's behaviour. It's very possible that she was influenced by a lot of narratives
6429680	6434000	perpetuated by certain individuals who had legitimate business towards Nik. Just because
6434000	6438880	she's a large YouTuber, doesn't mean she's the one influencing all these other creators
6438880	6443360	with her opinions. And this is what leads me to my next point, the YouNow streams.
6443360	6449520	Trisha- I was never going to, like, I don't know, I was never going to, I wasn't gonna, like, collab,
6449520	6453440	you know what I mean? Like, I don't know where that came from. I do hang out with lots of YouTubers
6453440	6458960	when they do come, and if I am feeling good and well, and I just get pissed when people are like,
6458960	6463520	she flaked on me, she blew me off of you. Look, I never even opened his messages, and I saw I had,
6463760	6468160	literally, like, 50 DMs from him that I never saw. I mean, I don't talk shit on YouTubers, but that,
6468160	6476880	like, was so, like, it was just, it was weird. I was like, if I didn't respond to someone or
6476880	6480080	I didn't confirm a date, I would not be booking. I don't know where he lives, apparently he lives
6480080	6483520	somewhere else anyways. Nik- But she does know that I was flying there, because I told her I
6483520	6488560	was already booking regardless for my visa. She does know that I don't live there, because she
6488560	6494400	asked about it, and I responded, yes, I do live in Colombia. She was plain stupid in front of
6494400	6499920	hundreds of thousands of people, and how do you think this affected my channel? The trust that
6499920	6504800	my audience had in me? I try to watch Nikkato Avocado, but I can't when someone, this is so
6504800	6509280	gross if you don't even want to eat, like, when someone, like, burps or farts when they're eating,
6509280	6512320	like, well, I don't even like it anyways, but when you're eating, like, ugh, it kind of makes me
6512320	6517200	gross out, so I can't with him. Well, this was, this was a surprise to me. That's not what she
6517200	6522000	told me. Now, on one hand, she was fundamentally wrong, but the fact that she sent messages which
6522000	6526240	showed her correspondence with Nik before then appearing to deny it doesn't make it seem very
6526240	6531120	calculated. Being calculated often doesn't ensue openly contradicting yourself with your own
6531120	6535280	evidence. Now, there could be an element of calculation, as obviously Trisha's own You Now
6535280	6540720	streams have greater reach than any of the DMs shown in the other videos, but it could also just
6540720	6545280	be standard trash talk. I'll allow you to make your own judgement on that one. I think a much
6545280	6550320	more textbook example of calculation would be taking this clip out of context, and then using
6550320	6555520	it to support a point which otherwise has very little backing. Who would do something like that?
6555520	6581840	Alright, Nick. This was another clip in Nikocado's Trisha compilation, and on first viewing, you
6581840	6584880	wouldn't suspect anything until you find the full clip.
6612320	6616720	Did you notice the difference? If you didn't, I wouldn't blame you, but he cut out the bit where
6616720	6622560	she said she had no idea until Martin Lewis DMed her, and brought it to her attention, because she
6622560	6628400	was snowed under due to other situations, situations that Nick acknowledges in his DM.
6628400	6633120	Does this change the fact that her recollection is still pretty dodgy? No. She may not have been
6633120	6636880	sure that he was coming at the point that she stopped responding, but she definitely set up the
6636880	6641280	expectations for him to come, and it doesn't change the fact that she had more communication with him
6641280	6646000	than just his violin cover, but it does show that she was not behaving in a particularly
6646000	6650960	instigatory manner, and I think Nick knew this, and he knew that there were murmurs before Trisha
6650960	6655520	reacted. Add this to the fact that YouNow streams often involve people interacting with their
6655520	6659840	audience, something that I'm sure Nick's aware of, and it's very easy that these things were brought
6659840	6664960	up towards Trisha, and she just responded in her standard chaotic fashion. I don't know what this
6664960	6669440	says about her other statements on the matter, because I couldn't find them, but it doesn't make
6669440	6674800	me somewhat suspicious as to the ones that are cut more neatly, but we're not finished there.
6674800	6684080	I mean, she, for half a year, would blast me on YouNow. Months, and months, and months. One was
6684080	6690160	published in February, one was published in March, one was published in June, one was in July.
6690160	6706800	TRISHA I like your avocado avocado stuff, though.
6706800	6710320	NICK You like the Nickacado videos that I make?
6710320	6715200	You see, our avocado acquaintance here took the YouNow clips regarding Trisha speaking about his
6715200	6719840	weight gain to imply that she had been continuously bringing attention to this. In a video by the
6720720	6725840	Primink, I don't know if you've heard of him, some twink, he shows the context for these clips.
6731440	6736000	This is from a YouNow with Martin Lewis, the same guy who sent Trisha the DMs years ago.
6736000	6741600	What a small world. First off, Nick was brought up first by Martin Lewis in the stream because
6741600	6754800	it was a drama topic. And if you let the clip play for a few more seconds than Nick did,
6754800	6759280	you can see that Trisha was actually saying she doesn't like when Martin is mean and makes fun
6759280	6770240	of people. TRISHA
6789280	6805520	She didn't just mention him out of the blue to talk bad about him, like Nick portrays.
6810160	6814480	This clip is from a YouNow with a guy named Vegan Cheetah. Vegan Cheetah was making quite
6814480	6819120	a few videos on Nick at the time, and Trisha popped into his YouNows all the time for hours
6819120	6824240	and hours. I think she had a crush on him because some of the times she's drunk, which if you're
6824240	6829200	ever bored, I highly recommend you go watch her drunk streams. It's an experience.
6829200	6842240	TRISHA
6842240	6846240	Throughout this whole YouNow Vegan Cheetah was asking Trisha how to improve his channel.
6859200	6867440	He asked how to improve his topics, what videos does Trisha like, all of this stuff. And finally,
6867440	6872160	she told him that she likes his Nick videos because he made a lot of Nick videos at the time.
6889760	6893840	TRISHA He kept asking Trisha what she liked,
6893840	6899520	and she told him what she liked. Once again, it wasn't out of the blue, she wasn't bullying him,
6899520	6903680	it was a pretty normal conversation. When you're a huge YouTuber who's pretty problematic,
6903680	6908160	people are going to talk about you. It comes with the territory. Nick took these super short,
6908160	6911680	out of context clips and put them into a narrative that made Trisha look bad.
6911680	6916480	You can make anyone look bad if you only show 10 seconds of them without any context.
6919200	6922800	In this out of context clip, Trisha was actually defending Nick.
6933920	6937680	The funny thing is about Nick is that he's a troll. Much like Trisha,
6937680	6941200	he makes videos to make people mad or get a reaction out of them,
6941200	6946160	because reactions equals views and views equals money. Both Trisha and Nick know this
6946160	6950320	very well. They're both masters at it. Which is also why this video is kinda weird to me,
6950320	6954560	because a lot of the things Nick calls Trisha out for, he also does on his channel.
6976160	6983680	Nick- I'm done. I'm done. Get the fuck out of here.
6986320	6993200	But she's not. She's playing the mental instability card.
6993200	7000240	I am not having it today. I am not having it today. Today, missy two shoes.
7000240	7004320	Unless Nick had picked it from a compilation video of which I could not find any,
7004320	7008160	there's no way that he would have missed the context for those clips, which also means that
7008160	7013200	he intentionally cut them in a way to support his point. It seems that with context, Nick Ocado
7013200	7018320	showed no actual clips about Trisha Paytas talking about him without provocation, and on top of that,
7018320	7023600	Trisha appears to defend him. He also frames these streams as partaking over the span of months on a
7023600	7028640	continuous basis, like Trisha was just trying to drum up this continuous wave of harassment against
7028640	7033680	him. A majority, if not all of the clips where she mentions Nick's weight gain are in YouNow streams
7033680	7038320	with people who have pre-existing drama with Nick Ocado, and Nick wasn't the core topic of those
7038320	7043120	streams regardless. You can't expect your name to never be mentioned by someone when you yourself
7043120	7050800	have mentioned Trisha in passing as well. Nick- I mean, she, for half a year, would blast me
7051440	7057040	on YouNow. Months, and months, and months. Now, I don't find evidence to support this either,
7057040	7061360	most of the clips had Nick being brought up in passing, her streams with Vegan Cheetah definitely
7061360	7065680	appear to be made around that time that they collaborated together, and I think the motive
7065680	7069760	may have been a little more based on the principle of attraction. Just a hunch.
7070560	7075760	So this went on for months, and months, and months, and what stemmed from it was comments,
7075760	7078800	and comments, and comments for months, and months, and months.
7078800	7084000	Yeah, I don't care for his videos or for his personality, but you know, whatever, it doesn't matter.
7084000	7091840	Nick- Of people assuming the worst about me, because she gave them that platform to do so,
7091840	7097040	you know, she kind of entertained the rumors, she spread the rumors herself, deliberately,
7097040	7101440	and then she entertained the ones that came out of it, and laughed about it in my face.
7101440	7106080	It's not hard to research his Twitter mentions from around this time, and there are really no
7106080	7110320	mentions of this. Now, that's not to say they never existed, accounts are deleted,
7110320	7114800	comments are also deleted sometimes, but none of the comments are present on a disproportionate
7114800	7119440	basis to other drama he was engaged in at the time. If anything, it seems the people who did
7119440	7124560	jump on the drama had serious baggage with Nick, and would continue to torment over other drama
7124560	7128800	that Nick provoked in the coming months, including some very controversial content.
7129360	7134480	Was Trisha's behavior unprofessional and unfair? Definitely, and I'll probably have to look down
7134480	7138480	that rabbit hole eventually, but Nick's video felt like he had chosen a perspective based on
7138480	7142720	a murky recollection of events, and then sought to find the evidence after he had chosen his
7142720	7147760	position, which led to a bending of the truth, as the situation wasn't quite as he recalled.
7147760	7152080	He's more than happy to show some receipts, but a lot of the remaining evidence is either impossible
7152080	7157200	to verify, or doctored by Nick himself. The video felt unnecessary, and rhetoric aside,
7157200	7161600	it seemed that there was very little justification for the existence of such a video, but he had one
7161600	7180160	more ace up his sleeve, but it didn't really feel like an ace to me, more like a joker.
7191600	7197280	The Joker card was introduced in the 19th century, as a trump card for the game of
7197280	7201360	Eucra, the card that beats all others. Like the Joker in the game of Eucra,
7201360	7204640	in the context of Nick's video, Trisha's video would have been a trump card.
7205360	7210640	And I'm listening to this, I'm like, she loves us, she loves us together. How am I supposed to
7210640	7216480	know that? You didn't answer my emails, you never told me what happened, you leaked my DMs, you went
7216480	7221360	and talked trash about me for a year. How am I supposed to know that you love me this whole time?
7221360	7224720	What? Through the lens of Nick's video, after failing to follow through on a commitment,
7224720	7229360	lying about the situation, and then unleashing a tidal wave of animosity based on defamatory
7229360	7234800	statements, she's attempted to make peace in a rather disingenuous manner over this OnlyFans video.
7234800	7235520	You can listen here.
7235520	7264960	And I would have loved to hear,
7265840	7270560	this, I acknowledge what I did. I'm sorry I sent those messages out about you. And then she's like,
7270560	7273920	well, let's not talk about that. Let's just talk about all the good things I love about you.
7273920	7279040	Maybe if Nick's premise is held true, this would stand as the solid trump card, but with the context
7279040	7283520	we realise that we are playing a very different card game indeed, one where the Joker doesn't
7283520	7288400	hold the same value that Nick has assigned to it. Does this make Trisha an angel? No, as said,
7288400	7292720	she screwed up, but her video explaining that her animosity has faded, and that she hopes they
7292720	7296880	can move beyond that is probably the most mature thing she could have said. She doesn't say that
7296880	7301600	the animosity was justified, nor does she attempt to push any blame onto Nick, which she could well
7301600	7306000	have done. She states there probably was a communication breakdown, and although undeniable
7306000	7310800	sugarcoating is completely true, in fact, a communication breakdown is a perfect way to
7310800	7313760	explain how irrational feelings of animosity may arise.
7340800	7351280	With this in mind, the whole premise for Nick's video's existence is strange. At the time,
7351280	7358240	Trisha Paytas cameos cost $150. Orlin paid $150 to someone who Nick frames as having
7358240	7363360	serious history with, and on top of that, asks a person to say something negative about Nick.
7363360	7369680	That is one strange birthday present, and one that conveniently fits into a video exposing her.
7369680	7373840	In all honesty, I think Nick and Orlin knew what they were doing when they requested this cameo,
7373840	7378400	and was probably disappointed that Trisha didn't give him anything outwardly unreasonable to work
7378400	7383280	with, because as said, Trisha will have her time, and this does not excuse her other actions,
7383280	7388240	but given what we know, and how certain clips are actually in context, it doesn't hold the same
7388240	7390080	power, it just seems strange.
7418240	7429120	I don't understand how you're sticking out for me. I've never felt that way, ever.
7430240	7435680	For years. I mean, you don't even follow me on your Instagram, you don't follow me on Twitter.
7435680	7439920	And again, you don't have to follow me. I'm not saying this is what upsets me, I'm saying
7440480	7444800	I don't see any evidence to support that you stick up for me, and that you care about me.
7444800	7448720	Like, what? And if this is real, if she is being truthful, that she loves being
7448720	7454640	sticks up for me, and she thinks I'm awesome, and everything, why have I never heard from her
7456240	7462480	to rectify that huge shitstorm that she pretty much caused me,
7463840	7468080	and my family, and all of my viewers? For years.
7470400	7474560	When this all went down years ago, I never shared my truth, I never said the truth.
7474560	7478560	Overall, the video was rather weak. He states that the video exists because he didn't want to
7478560	7483600	speak up the time, but if this was really his truth, he would have made it the truth.
7483600	7488560	Equally, I don't think Trisha is some calculated mastermind. If anything, Nick's video is much
7488560	7493360	more orchestrated than any of Trisha's actions. Was there a story here? Maybe, but it was the
7493360	7498480	kind of thing that you'd rant about on the side while having an Asian KFC rather than channeling
7498480	7504240	the energy into a takedown style video. But after the Veronica Wang drama, Nick had a formula that
7504240	7509200	worked, and he applied it to another person who was not known for their concise responses. In fact,
7509200	7514320	Trisha was just coming off the back of another contentious drama with H3H3, another situation
7514320	7518880	which she could have presented a strong case fairly rationally, but devolved into antics
7518880	7526560	which many felt were emotionally manipulative. She goes from model to WWE wrestler, like,
7526560	7531920	it's just, it already has such a complex, it's such a complex.
7535680	7540640	It was another easy target for Nick, and he composed the video using the scraps that he obtained
7540640	7545920	very well. For Trisha, it was a hard situation to overturn. She had let him down, and ultimately,
7545920	7550400	even if a portion of Nick's allegations were built on exaggerated rhetoric and edited content,
7550400	7554560	her failure to resolve it and instead resorting to going on streams of people who Nick clearly
7554560	7558720	had negative experiences with was highly unprofessional. Sure, the video said things
7558720	7563680	about Nick, but it also said things about Trisha, and at the time, people cared more about one person
7563680	7568000	than the other, so no matter what Trisha said, she was going to be fighting a losing battle.
7568000	7572480	Nick knew this, so he just jumped on whatever she said for a response video. Some of this stuff
7572480	7577200	seems related to what he's been saying, such as those tweets on the day of the video. Other stuff,
7577200	7578560	not as much.
7578560	7581440	But one thing we have to remember is that the internet is not real life.
7582480	7588080	People that you interact with on the internet can be lovely and wonderful,
7589200	7592240	but they can also be really hateful and negative and evil.
7592240	7598400	I did not tell people to unfollow her. I didn't tell people to dislike her. I didn't tell people
7599040	7605200	to unsubscribe. I didn't tell people to leave hateful comments. I didn't bring anyone else
7605200	7612000	unrelated to our issue into the video. I didn't tell people what to think, ultimately.
7613200	7619680	I shared my truth. I told the truth. I backed up my truth with evidence.
7620640	7627920	I came to the table prepared with receipts, and I was 100% transparent.
7627920	7631120	Nick has no proof that this comment has anything to do with his video,
7631120	7635840	other than it was from around that general time. It doesn't seem the most relevant for someone who's
7635840	7640880	so used to random hate online. Nick appears to think that Trisha could only be referring to him
7640880	7645920	as the sole perpetrator of such antagonism. Amongst the controversy she had been entangled in,
7645920	7650640	although she had made amends in the H3 situation, her comments did not seem creator specific,
7650640	7655520	and Nick goes in on this, and the stupid thing is, he gives the reasons for exactly why the
7655520	7675600	comment probably isn't directed at him. Some of his responses are valid. Once again,
7675600	7679680	Trisha made the mistake, and he's sure to hammer that in, but some of his other statements are
7679680	7685440	either disingenuous, unproven, or so unbelievably ironic that it's borderline satire.
7685440	7690560	What I don't understand, if she wants to imply that I'm not being truthful with what I showed
7690560	7696080	everybody, she needs to prove otherwise. I mean, it's one of these things where some people believe
7696080	7702880	if they say it over and over and over enough that it becomes true. If you hear it enough times,
7703760	7710960	that's a fact. But it's not. And I told everyone what happened. I showed them the DMs.
7710960	7714960	I showed the video clips of her acting like she didn't know who I was,
7715600	7720480	making faces when my weight came into discussion, egging people on to continue the gossip.
7721520	7725680	All the while, I had to watch this in humility. I would like to know how I'm not being truthful
7725680	7731120	here. If she wants to make these implications, she has to show for it. Otherwise, it's just
7731120	7737600	flat out rude, and it's just another slap in the face. Trisha then posted a mukbuk
7737600	7743840	right after she had posted a video saying that she's done with mukbangs, and that she's going to
7743840	7749920	address her diet and change it. If she's willing to go to this length to lie about something so
7749920	7755520	trivial as what you eat, what else do you think she's willing to do? Actually, someone replied
7755520	7758880	to me and said, it's obviously prerecorded, you're starting to look desperate. And I said, no.
7759840	7766000	First of all, Trisha has been doing this to me for two years. Two years, I had to read these
7766000	7772640	comments, feel this pain, and keep it to myself. Over two years, two and a half years. This is my
7772640	7779600	moment. And the fact that it is prerecorded, and she chose to put a mukbang right after announcing
7779600	7785680	she was done with them, it shows that she knows how to play her cards. She knows that it will get
7785680	7791040	a reaction, it will make people upset, it will create more comments. When I told people that
7791040	7798080	Trisha was calculating with me, I'm willing to say that she's calculating with you. And how smart
7798080	7802800	of Trisha to use a card like this, because let's face it, in society, if you question
7803520	7809680	the validity of what she says, you're seen as an awful person. And this is a very powerful card.
7809680	7812640	But one thing we have to remember is that the internet is not real life.
7812640	7819520	So if the internet's not real, what's going on? Smoke and mirrors. This is a way to cop out
7820160	7823920	and to cover up, because it's that touchy of a subject.
7823920	7830800	Ah yes, Trisha, the mastermind. Thank you Nick for illuminating that very manipulative tweet.
7830800	7837360	Trisha is very smart indeed, a true galaxy brain of our generation. But for me, with my game,
7837360	7842560	his Joker card was useless, and only served to highlight the absurdity of some of his statements.
7843120	7849520	Remember you guys, I came back, literally with a luggage, full of coffee, full of sombreros,
7849520	7855280	full of keychains and little presents for Trisha, and sat down and said, what the fuck did I do
7855280	7859920	wrong? And then to turn the computer and to see Trisha talking about my weight, regardless,
7859920	7866160	was so manipulative and just another part of the mind control, another part of the,
7866880	7870640	look who has the power, type of game she was playing.
7870640	7875600	Mind control. This is the man that many believed, but how long would that belief last for?
7882480	7886800	As said, Trisha's behaviour wasn't appropriate, and I can understand why it would bother Nick,
7886800	7891840	but it didn't strike me as dangerous or out of character. She didn't follow up with him on plans
7891840	7898320	to collaborate, unreliable and flaky, but Nick said he was okay with that. She sent DMs to drama
7898320	7903200	channels who asked, kinda trashy but not edited like Nick claims, and not at the time that he
7903200	7908240	claims either. She goes onto a stream with some of these channels and mentions him, expected,
7908240	7913280	not to the degree he claims, and not necessarily maliciously either. The only real thing that there
7913280	7917760	is to complain about here is that she misframes the situation when talking about it, and appears
7917760	7923440	to dismiss the contact they had, which is unfair, but as said, I don't think it makes her some
7923440	7926960	calculated mastermind, and even some of that was taken out of context.
7926960	7931120	Nick- I'm just putting it out there because you put it out there for two and a half years,
7931120	7939520	how you felt about me. This is how I feel about you. You heard me, and I don't want to play this game.
7939520	7945760	I don't want to play dog and bone, smoking mirrors, whipping out cards, and brushing things under the rug.
7945760	7951920	Just turn on the camera, remind all your viewers that the internet is real,
7953360	7961040	that your feelings and the things you say to other humans are real, and that includes me.
7961040	7966960	But Nick, without a doubt, was masterclassing these exposed videos. In his second video,
7966960	7970880	he even retracts his points about the clips because people found the context for them,
7970880	7974880	and still manages to convey the necessity for the existence of this upload.
7974880	7982000	She's eating popcorn, watching me be made fun of, watching people speculate, watching people
7982000	7987760	talk negatively, watching people gossip. She enjoyed it, and that's what she said in this clip.
7987760	8006080	Nick- Part of that context was my weight gain. I wasn't specific. I flew over it literally in 30
8006080	8009360	seconds. I just wanted to say that she had mentioned my weight gain, and it made me
8009360	8014480	uncomfortable. I wish I could take that out. It doesn't change the fact from anything. I was
8014480	8019360	just trying to find examples to show you that she did know who I was, and she continued to talk
8019360	8024320	smack. Eventually, he goes in on Trisha for her antics regarding a breakup that happened months
8024320	8028400	before. Everything must have been taken out of context. Remember what I said? She's going to
8028960	8035360	smoke and mirrors, throw another bone, make the dogs run this way. Guess who decides to
8035360	8041680	have that monumental breakdown about a breakup that happened three or four months ago? That's
8041680	8046560	right. Trisha posts a breakdown about Jason. Didn't she just say she wishes him well and loves
8046560	8051440	him? Didn't she just say something about his dick or something? All of a sudden, now she's really,
8051440	8057360	really sad. I almost feel like she got the sadness for knowing that she effed up, saw everyone coming
8057360	8063280	at her in the corner, got all emotional, and used that emotion to tap into her feelings about Jason.
8063280	8067600	I mean, she's an actress. She's a self-proclaimed actress. She has been on so many TV shows with
8067600	8070320	different personalities. I remember watching an interview where she said,
8071360	8076640	I want to be someone that you don't know who I really am. That's fucked up when it involves
8076640	8081360	hurting other people. Initially, this was stupefying to me because he was calling out Trisha for
8081360	8086160	something that had been a part of his brand for years, claiming that it's some elaborate ploy,
8086160	8091360	when in fact, it's completely the opposite. The timing is so unbelievably awful that no half
8091360	8096240	intelligent, manipulative person would make such a video, and people called it out without Nick's
8096240	8101120	help. Trisha's eventual response video would be called, I'm cancelled again, a reference to the
8101120	8106640	number of times this happens. Nick knows this too well, and yet frames it like some revelation.
8106640	8114400	People were on it from the get-go, and then she decided to just ban all comments, ban all ability
8114400	8119520	to thumbs up or thumbs down. I mean, if you stand by what you say and believe in, you will always
8119520	8124560	leave that open, and for the majority of Trisha's channel, she always has. I mean, I can think of
8124560	8129440	probably one video where she actually banned people from being able to share their thoughts
8129440	8135440	on her page. This screams guilty, louder than anything. Nick had the tea, but the tea was
8135440	8140240	tainted, and Trisha's eventual response video, although flawed, did illuminate that.
8140240	8144080	You know, Woody Allen still frickin' works, you know what I mean? Like, Roman Polanski...
8145520	8150640	Did he do something wrong? Yeah, he did something wrong. Wait, wrong clip. It happens at this time
8150640	8154160	of the video. Everyone keeps telling me a video about you, I just watched your video about
8154160	8157280	Sean. I'm so sorry for everything you went through. I don't know when the best time is
8157280	8160240	to ask, but you talked about getting closure, being upfront, being a professional, and I
8160240	8167200	really appreciate if you gave me a little closure too. I don't owe you closure. Chalk me up as to
8167200	8172640	some flaky lunatic YouTuber, as I do. I meet so many frickin' YouTubers and so many people that
8172640	8176800	are flaky and crazy. I'm just like, oh, that's just a crazy person. I'm just gonna, you know...
8177520	8184000	Closure is something when a friend dumps you after 10 years. Closure is something after
8184000	8188320	someone's cheated on you and trying to find out why, and like, that's when someone owes you
8188320	8193040	something because you put in so much time. It may have been common courtesy to tell someone about
8193040	8198880	their position. Patricia didn't want to, and is okay with being judged on that basis. I don't think
8198880	8204160	her response is the strongest because I think you need to accept some fault. She acted incredibly
8204160	8208800	enthusiastically towards his works, and then just stopped responding. It probably did confuse him
8208800	8213440	and lead him on, and she did trash talk a bit in future streams, but over the space of two rather
8213440	8217680	erratic videos, she provides an explanation for a majority of her actions.
8217680	8221440	This is the other reason why I'm just like so scared to even say I'm always down, but like I said,
8222000	8225520	when things change, they change, and like, yeah, at the time I would go on YouNow and talk about it,
8225520	8229600	because at the time he did say I paid for his thing. Everyone was like, he didn't say that,
8229600	8236640	but he did. I didn't edit out anything. I screenshotted. I'm not an editor.
8236640	8242080	Whether you think these explanations justify her point of view is down to you, and yet a day after
8242080	8247920	Trisha's second video mentioning the situation, Nick uploads another 18 minute video, and it is the worst.
8247920	8252720	The first two minutes in particular are shocking, and you can literally play Trisha's clips from the
8252720	8256640	videos that Nick is responding to as many responses to his points.
8282720	8286480	When things change, they change, and like, yeah, at the time I would go on YouNow and talk about it,
8286480	8291120	because at the time he did say I paid for his thing. Everyone was like, he didn't say that, but he did.
8312720	8318560	reputation when I was very small. Why did she not move on? Where she felt the need to entertain
8318560	8323520	rumors about me. Some of the things that she's saying about me that my viewers might be believing.
8323520	8328720	Again, this is not for her. She's made it very clear. She has no care in the world for me.
8328720	8333440	So on the YouNow, I say to, I was talking to, what was that guy? There's some drama channel.
8333440	8337760	Good as me. Oh, I forgot his name. Honestly, this sounds awful, but I like, I don't care.
8338400	8343200	And that's fine. I will live with that. He also showed video where you kept talking about his
8343200	8350720	weight more than once. I saw the video. Do you regret that? But he edited. So on the YouNow,
8350720	8354800	I say to, I was talking to, what was that guy? There's some drama channel. I forgot his name.
8354800	8358880	Oh, I forgot his name. And I literally say he gained weight and like, okay, so he got fat.
8358880	8363280	So what? And he added that part where I'm like, so what? I went on Social Blade because I'm a curious
8363280	8369280	George. And your numbers have gone down over the last week by a considerable amount. Nothing James
8369280	8376880	Charles, but clearly people have not loved your reaction, your response to all this drama. And
8376880	8382240	his video has done very well. It's got like 2 million views. How does that make you feel?
8382960	8388480	I mean, it like, honestly, it just sounds awful, but I like, I don't care because this is something
8388480	8393920	that I am so like, I'm sorry. I felt, I didn't, I felt harassed by him. Like he like kept going,
8393920	8399840	dm, dm, dm. He harassed, he lied. I didn't, I felt harassed by him. That was, it was so insane. It
8399840	8404080	was so insane and so scary to me. And if you're scared and you're like a little like, I'm being
8404080	8410240	targeted by a weird and she's being targeted by a weird and she's like reverse psychology.
8410240	8415360	She's saying that this is who I am. And by reacting, I'm therefore proving her point.
8416320	8422240	I've never been manipulated like this in my whole life. Um, and that's why this video is hard for me
8422240	8427360	to make. Nick frames it like he's the victim of some master puppeteering from Trisha Paytas,
8427360	8432720	which is giving her far too much credit. I could go on for the record in that clip. Trisha's
8432720	8436640	actually reading out someone else's comments, but I think Nick knows that. I don't think Nick
8436640	8440960	harassed her or anything, and I don't think it's fair of Trisha to claim that. But Nick talking
8440960	8447280	with the hushed tones and sincere confusion and hurt is by no means any less disingenuous
8447280	8452960	than Trisha. Trisha's responses are not very good. You could take them apart quite easily.
8452960	8458000	Nick does this with some of the responses, such as Trisha's rather dark tweets, but mostly fails
8458000	8463200	with others because it doesn't fit into his narrative. For example, and tried to ruin my
8463200	8470640	reputation on purpose and then twist it so that if I react, I'm crazy. She says he's a little off,
8470640	8475520	and gestures to imply he's unhinged, and it is insensitive, and suddenly it's actually
8475520	8480480	this gaslighting tactic to make him doubt his intentions in making another 18 minute video.
8480480	8485600	But I don't buy it. Gaslighting is built on intent, as we'll soon find out, and I don't believe
8485600	8491200	that Trisha had that intent. I think she saw a person who messaged her a lot, paid $150 for a
8491200	8496560	cameo to use in a video against her before posting another over her failures, and she probably
8496560	8501520	thought he was a bit unstable. Does that mean it's the right thing to say? No, but Nick's narrative
8501520	8506320	that she's some master manipulator is based on the premise that Trisha was just on some campaign of
8506320	8510960	harassment against him, and is now trying to silence him, a narrative that doesn't really stand
8510960	8515840	when you consider the flaws in his own. If I was in Trisha's shoes, if I believed that Nick was
8515840	8520880	really that bothered over DMs, he genuinely thought I was out to destroy him and made multiple
8520880	8525840	videos for that reason alone, maybe I think he was a little unhinged too, but I don't think that was
8525840	8530320	his motive. I think he was capitalising on a personal problem that he previously held against
8530320	8535360	a controversial creator acquiring some reputation points, and grabbing Trisha's attention in that
8535360	8540960	moment too, and to be fair, it worked. Despite Trisha being a master manipulator, and Nick being
8540960	8546000	this crazed stalker, Trisha apologised at the start of August and they hashed it out in another mukbang,
8546000	8548000	so maybe they do deserve each other.
8548320	8553440	Look, like, the internet is so huge, you have such a big following, like, you just go do you, like,
8553440	8558560	you're doing so good, like, I know it's fun, like, you're getting them views and stuff, like, by going
8558560	8562960	back and forth with me, but like, honestly, like, when I'm- and there's some people I'm just done
8562960	8566480	with, and I will- I will never acknowledge again this person being one of them after today.
8570480	8576640	I'm really sorry. I obviously would never have made a cameo if I hated you, or had any ill will,
8576640	8582160	or any sort of resentment. I didn't realise you still had it towards me, and again, I apologise.
8582160	8590240	I apologise for how everything went down, and I respect what you do, and I applaud your success.
8591440	8596320	I personally think the only manipulator in this situation was Nick, however, in his mind,
8596320	8602560	the means justified the ends. He had been wronged, he'd righted it, and collected a W in the process.
8603280	8607920	Throughout the videos, I received the impression that Nick really just wanted Trish's attention,
8607920	8613360	and in the end, he did acquire that, so fair play to him, but by collecting a W,
8613360	8617280	Nick set a standard, one that could ultimately do more harm than good.
8617280	8637120	Nick's second video on Trisha Paytas in particular is a fascinating video for me,
8637120	8641760	because he basically calls out something that we can identify in his own brand, the forced
8641760	8646880	melodrama. So why didn't people call him out for hypocrisy in that moment? Well, there was one key
8646880	8652080	difference, that Nick never weaponised his overly emotional videos with regards to drama with other
8652080	8657120	creators. He provoked his own drama. Why is this detail important? Because it allowed Nick to create
8657120	8661680	a new commentary brand about other creators which was detached from his otherwise capricious
8661680	8667120	reputation. He is able to transform this image into a creator who's not afraid to spill the tea
8667120	8671840	and call out other people who are engaging in these deplorable actions. Things were looking
8671840	8675920	up for Nick, as he established himself as a legitimate voice of common sense from within
8675920	8679760	the community. I don't know if that says more about Nick, or the community, but he released
8679760	8684320	multiple videos, particularly on a news third channel about trending drama and personal feuds.
8684320	8695360	Because I've never, you know, everything that happened, the fact that we have the ability to
8696640	8708080	come back and be who we are because, you know, us growing up. Oh, oh, all about ourselves again.
8708080	8715520	This was the issue that I personally had watching the whole charade five months ago, four months ago.
8715520	8720400	But it was all about me, me, me, me, me, me. I don't even know. This was about what they did to
8720400	8724800	someone else. Instead of focusing on the victims, we're gonna focus on ourselves. Everything we've
8724800	8731040	been to, everything we go through, we're ourselves. If that's yourself, I hope I don't bump into you on
8731040	8735040	the street. In the comment sections of these videos, many viewers would praise Nick for his
8735040	8739600	clinical nature while dealing with this drama, but true to his word, he continued to upload videos
8739600	8744880	dramatizing his own life with often mixed feedback. He was by no means letting off the other persona
8744880	8748880	with the minds of this new one. However, it did make the tonal shifts a little jarring.
8749600	8756720	This is your fault, Missy. This is your fault. I broke it now. It's your fault.
8772240	8776720	Nick's call-out videos may have been valid in some ways. If you want to find out, you can go and
8776720	8780560	watch them all. But ultimately, what the drama with Trisha Paytas told us is that a lot of
8780560	8785680	audiences tend to trust the creator if they can convey themselves in a credible way, rather than
8785680	8790400	necessarily looking at the claims. For anyone familiar with Nick, they would have noticed that
8790400	8795120	this wasn't all too different to his persona when he exited the vegan community, and tried to make
8795120	8799760	some pretty solidly reasoned arguments for why he left, but ultimately let that part of himself go
8799760	8804480	when he had to confront that maybe his new lifestyle wasn't as physically beneficial as he
8804480	8809840	had previously preached. But now he had a new use for his reasoned persona, YouTube drama. What
8809840	8815360	could possibly go wrong? While Nick was operating multiple personas at once, this allowed him to
8815360	8819840	make the most of multiple audiences, but when you're operating different personas, some of which
8819840	8824320	may seem incompatible with each other, you may be biting off more than you can chew. However, for
8824320	8829440	most of 2019, he was able to balance these new characters and reap the benefits for it, whether
8829440	8835840	that be financial or fanatical, but there was one more advantage worth noting. Assumedly a consequence,
8835840	8841040	though it could be coincidental, was that he began to collaborate with a fair few new faces, many of
8841040	8845520	whom large established creators from within the community. There didn't seem to be any particular
8845520	8849440	friction between these individuals, the worst that some people observed was probably Nick's
8849440	8854320	collaborations with Trisha Paytas, which many felt were a little awkward, but to be honest, their
8854320	8856040	whole existence is awkward.
8856040	8861280	Nick, can I just say one of my favourite things on you now, a long time ago, when you were talking to someone
8861280	8866240	we don't want to mention, you were just like, the views are gone, the views are down.
8866240	8867440	Did I say that about me or you?
8867440	8868800	There's no views about yourself.
8868800	8869300	Oh yeah.
8869300	8873280	You were on YouNow, like, the views are down, there's no more views, the views are gone.
8873280	8876720	You watched it a bunch of times, you have my bannerisms and everything, I was like, okay.
8876720	8877720	It was funny.
8877720	8883280	Nick appeared to welcome many of these collaborations with open arms, why wouldn't he? The more alliances
8883320	8885160	and apparent endorsements the merrier.
8885160	8889280	Maybe his collaborators were hoping that if they worked with him, they wouldn't have to suffer at the
8889280	8890760	hands of any exposed videos.
8890760	8893640	I mean, they probably had reason to not blow him off at least.
8893640	8901360	Nikocado Avocado, our Mukbang King, riding high on top of the world with all his new little friends.
8901360	8906680	Now, Trisha Paytas aside, most of his new YouTube collaborators, at least, had little previous involvement
8906680	8908680	in public views with Mr Avocado.
8908720	8914000	However, in December, with Christmas quickly approaching, we were introduced to an individual by the name of
8914000	8916480	Stephanie Soo, but this was no first impression.
8916480	8921920	No, this was around the year anniversary of the Veronica Wang drama, which was inspired by Shook Bang's
8921920	8925400	edited footage of Veronica's collaboration with our friend Stephanie here.
8925880	8928840	The other individual of interest is Zach Choi ASMR.
8928840	8931400	He had previously collaborated with Nick and Stephanie.
8931400	8936280	However, in mid-December, they decided to put their powers together and conduct a three-way collab on each
8936280	8937120	of their brother's channels.
8937120	8941320	Nick and Zach have done this before, but it was the first for Stephanie on either channel.
8941320	8945200	The first video was uploaded onto Zach's channel on the 15th of December.
8945200	8948960	Nothing seems out of the ordinary because no one actually talks in his videos.
8948960	8953560	It was a similar case for the second video, which came out on Nick's third channel the day after.
8967280	8975800	The day after that, a video went up on Nick's main channel, where they enjoy 10 packs of spicy ramen noodles
8975800	8977920	and actually have the opportunity to talk.
8977920	8983600	Nothing seems particularly out of the ordinary, but for a brief spell towards the end, the previous drama is brought up.
8983600	8986920	What did you want to share, or do you change your mind now?
8990280	8994720	You said you wanted to talk to your viewers with me here because you never talked to any of your viewers.
8994720	9003680	I guess the thing that I would clear up is that a lot of people think that I didn't like you after those videos.
9003680	9005680	Okay, I didn't say that. Oh, I didn't see them.
9005680	9012320	Yeah, so I guess it kind of made it seem like because of those videos, we didn't publicly talk to each other
9012320	9017080	or post pictures or videos until way after when we met a couple months ago.
9017080	9017720	Maybe a year later.
9017720	9024240	Yes, so during that time period, people thought that maybe we didn't like each other at all because of those videos.
9024240	9026880	So, I mean, I didn't feel that way though.
9026880	9029720	I didn't even feel teary.
9029720	9033080	Now, keep in mind that I still hadn't watched Stephanie Sue's video at this point,
9033080	9038800	but with the experience that I have with Nick's content, I noticed that this part in particular was more heavily edited
9038800	9042120	than other parts of the video and seemed to end rather awkwardly.
9042120	9045480	It made me rather suspicious that there were some interactions missing here.
9045480	9050760	One more point I would like to add is that on the 16th of December, the day after the second video was posted,
9050800	9056120	it made some tweets alluding to spilling tea on another creator, alongside some Instagram comments,
9056120	9062400	and on the 20th of December, he made a video on All In's channel stating that he planned to expose another creator.
9062400	9067600	So with one video uploaded on Zach Troy's channel and two on Nikocado's channels,
9067600	9071920	there was an expectation that Stephanie Sue would be uploading a video too, and she did.
9071920	9072720	Let's have a look.
9072720	9079720	Hi, so I haven't really posted on this channel in the past couple of days or my other channel and I'm alive.
9079760	9085760	I think I didn't get me and some of you guys are worried, but I just kind of want to talk to you guys about what's been happening
9085760	9090320	the past couple of days because a lot has happened, and it's been really stressful.
9090320	9091320	Ah.
9097080	9102200	On the 21st of December, Stephanie Sue uploaded her video about her less than positive experience with
9103200	9111440	titled Why I Am Scared of Nikocado Avocado, a 47 minute video dragging Nick and some of his behaviour pretty brutally.
9111440	9117640	The video has now obtained over 10 million views and is widely cited as the video which wiped out any of Nick's
9117640	9118840	credibility online.
9118840	9122320	For me, there's a bit more to it, but let's talk about how and why.
9122320	9128320	Stephanie's video is ultimately about how Nick has used his power and influence in situations to manipulate,
9128360	9132440	bully and control Stephanie to the point where she feels unsafe.
9132440	9137200	Like I've been manipulated by fear that I can't say no to him.
9137200	9144840	I just want to take back my power to say no, not feel like someone's holding this thing over me and threatening me.
9144840	9149040	It's a very unforgiving perspective of Nikocado and his behaviour.
9149040	9150680	What does this behaviour entail?
9150680	9154280	Well, as noted, Stephanie was vaguely involved in the Veronica Wang drama.
9154280	9159640	Stephanie claims that she had spoken to Nick then for a brief period and that Nick wanted her to make a video on the topic,
9159640	9160640	but she declined.
9160640	9162720	Stephanie didn't want anything to do with the drama.
9162720	9165600	He wanted me to make a video on my side of the story.
9165600	9167720	I had told him that I wasn't involved.
9167720	9169400	I don't think I need to make a video.
9169400	9170840	It was just back and forth of that.
9170840	9173000	There have been various additional attempts to collaborate,
9173000	9178440	but it wasn't until a meal with Zach Choi that they truly managed to move past the hurdle of prior drama.
9178440	9189880	And at this point, we had been there for hours and he had made me feel so comfortable, so, so comfortable.
9189880	9192240	And like I could trust him.
9192240	9194320	Like he understood me.
9194320	9199400	I ended up opening up about something that I don't even talk about on YouTube anymore.
9199400	9203240	If you guys have been with me since the beginning, some of you may know.
9203240	9208600	But I was sexually assaulted in my own home.
9208600	9215160	It was somebody that I had let into my home and then they took away my power to say no.
9215160	9224120	And it's kind of just shattered any sort of security, any sort of security that I felt at home prior.
9224120	9230800	And then after that, I left with the very warm feeling of just, hey, he's nice.
9230800	9234080	Nick seemed very warm and sympathetic over the next few months.
9234080	9240320	There are poor built with her being open and talking about her home security and some anxieties that surrounded it.
9240320	9245040	In December, they agreed to collaborate on each other's channels with Zach over the space of the weekend.
9245040	9250280	And although the first day of recording went off without a hitch, it went rapidly downhill on the second.
9250280	9252520	Firstly, the topic of Veronica was brought up.
9252520	9258520	Nick asserted that Stephanie committed to talking about it the day before, despite Stephanie having no recollection of this.
9258520	9265120	Before we filmed Nick's video, his first video, the talking mukbang, we were supposed to go to H Mart and then go back to his place so that we could film it.
9265120	9270040	And we were in the car and the topic of what we were going to talk about in the talking mukbang came up.
9270040	9276600	And this is kind of when I first felt really uncomfortable because Nick said it very assertively.
9276600	9279600	We're going to talk about Veronica and we're going to spill all the tea.
9279600	9283880	And I was kind of confused because I was like, oh, whoa, what?
9283880	9286800	And so I was immediately like, no, no.
9286800	9291080	And then he he went, but why did you tell me yesterday that you wanted to then?
9291080	9293600	And so I thought back to what happened yesterday.
9293600	9302120	And prior to filming my mukbang for my channel, he had mentioned, you know, I think that we need to talk about Shukbang because, you know, everyone's going to be talking about it in the comments.
9302120	9303960	And I don't know why I believed it.
9303960	9308560	I said, oh, yeah, I mean, I guess it's weirder if we just act like it never happened.
9308560	9314160	And so I felt like I was comfortable mentioning Shukbang, addressing it to the capacity of me and Nick.
9314240	9320120	Yes, this is how we met through a Shukbang video, but we have no ill will towards each other.
9320120	9321840	It's all over. We're friends now.
9321840	9330240	You know, I felt like I would never tell him that I wanted to talk about Veronica and specifically spill the tea.
9330240	9332400	It had always been about Shukbang.
9332400	9334400	She cleared this up and thought it was dealt with.
9334400	9337600	However, around half an hour into their second collaboration video,
9337600	9344040	Nick brings up the topic of Shukbang and Veronica and allegedly begins twisting Stephanie's words very viciously.
9344040	9350520	And I just remember feeling just shocked because the way he went about it was just so almost like an interrogation.
9350520	9352920	But I was like, you know what? It's fine. It's fine.
9352920	9355680	I'm going to, you know, joke it off. I'm going to say my piece.
9355680	9361880	I said, you know, I don't have any hard feelings because you made those videos and I get why you made those videos.
9361880	9366760	I had these baby wipes in front of me and I kept wiping him every time he got too serious to just kind of play it off.
9366760	9367720	Like, let me wipe him off.
9367720	9373200	And every single time I tried to do that, increasingly, it seemed like he got more offended.
9373200	9380640	He would look at me with such a shocked face, like, I can't believe, but you said you wanted to talk about it.
9380640	9384120	And now you don't? Almost like, how dare you?
9384280	9386080	You said you wanted to talk about it.
9386080	9388640	And I just remember I kept trying to put it off.
9388640	9390280	I kept trying to show him I'm uncomfortable.
9390280	9396640	I kept trying to lighten the mood with jokes and give all of us an out of this conversation without ending it awkwardly.
9396760	9399120	But it was just rapid fire.
9399360	9404920	And it increasingly went from Shukba, maybe the first two sentences, into Veronica.
9405000	9412800	And then instead of asking me any more questions, he started twisting my words and he started saying things like,
9412920	9420480	if only you guys knew what she told me, I would never tell you guys what happened because she shared it with me in private.
9420680	9422760	She trusts me with these things.
9423120	9425200	But if you only knew.
9425280	9427560	When I heard, when you sat down with me.
9427560	9438920	And I remember this one part where I freaked out because he said, she is such a strong woman to me as if I had endured something so horrendous by Veronica.
9438960	9444120	And I almost was like, shoot, do I say like, oh, whoa, it's not that serious.
9444120	9450600	Like, all I did was go pick up hair dye with her, you know, but then that would defeat, like, I don't want to disclose all of this.
9450600	9452200	I'm not comfortable with sharing this.
9452200	9453960	This has nothing to do with anything.
9454200	9461840	And I remember picking up a baby wipe and being like, I don't know, like, my life is so hard being a mukbanger and like really trying to show him that,
9462080	9464760	hey, I'm trying to get out of this conversation.
9464760	9467040	Hey, I'm trying to get out of this conversation.
9467040	9470920	And I did this pretty much almost every two sentences he gave.
9471200	9482320	And increasingly, he looked at me with more and more shock on his face, as if he was shocked and angry at the fact that I refused to talk about what I told him in private.
9482560	9490720	This whole ordeal paints Nick as manipulative, gaining trust and information, and then using it against Stephanie in an attempt to cause her to start drama.
9490720	9497080	On top of all his comments, which state intent to expose a certain YouTuber, Stephanie felt frozen as to what to do.
9497720	9504680	I was in this space at this point where I felt like anything will be used against me.
9504680	9513240	And I felt like anything I say, even Nick's stop, he would use it and make an exposing video or threaten me with it.
9513240	9515160	I don't know, I was just scared.
9515160	9517280	Whoever I knew wasn't here anymore.
9517280	9519320	I just felt like it wasn't the same Nick I knew.
9519320	9520760	He knew that I was uncomfortable.
9520760	9523400	He knew I didn't want to talk about this, but he kept going.
9523720	9529880	And so at what point does my own comfort or does my feeling even matter to him?
9529880	9532480	All I know is I was incredibly shaken up.
9532720	9536720	And I just remember like, I didn't want to be in close proximity with him.
9536720	9542240	And I was just kind of like standing off to the side and I didn't want to say anything.
9542240	9544120	But I'm so nervous.
9544120	9545440	Like, I don't know what to do.
9545440	9548320	Oh, man, like, I wish I wish I didn't say that.
9548920	9554480	I'm so nervous because I felt like if I said I'm uncomfortable or I'm scared or why did you do that?
9554480	9557400	He would just get more and more increasingly angry with me.
9558120	9564840	I had this feeling of I just need to do whatever I can to get through tonight and tomorrow
9564840	9571760	because we have collab scheduled tomorrow and just be done with it because I don't want him to get angry.
9571760	9579400	I don't want him to make a video using these words and trying to say all these things I said about Veronica.
9579520	9581640	I just wanted to get through tonight.
9581640	9585920	And that sounds crazy even to me, like me saying that right now.
9585920	9587080	I sound crazy.
9587080	9589280	Stephanie, you are 24.
9589280	9592520	You should have got up and left, but I just couldn't.
9592520	9594440	I was just so scared that I couldn't.
9594840	9599400	These enduring issues leaked into the third video, although it was an ASMR video,
9599400	9602480	she still felt uncomfortable and Nick's conduct persisted.
9602480	9607120	This led to a lot of emotional stress after the session as she felt manipulated and exploited.
9607120	9610520	This affected her sleep pattern, which disturbed the plans for the next day.
9610520	9614320	She told Zach before messaging the group chat to inform Nick of her predicament.
9614320	9619880	She then shares DMs, which seem to reinforce Stephanie's impression of Nick's behaviour as rather unpleasant.
9619880	9626120	Stephanie is apologetic, but Nick rebukes this with hostility and is unsympathetic towards Stephanie's responses.
9626120	9630440	In a way, he's upholding his previous points, but it seems very nasty.
9630840	9636360	There are more DMs shown when Nick DMs her privately and channels frustrations about her messages to the group chat.
9636360	9640480	Stephanie also shares the post Nick uploaded to his Instagram story and feed,
9640520	9646960	and brings attention to the claims of audio clips, which Stephanie states made her anxious as she never consented to being recorded.
9646960	9652520	She states that while investigating this, she found security footage of Nick taking multiple photos of her house,
9652520	9654560	which she felt was violating her privacy.
9655000	9662600	And the audio clips that he posted on his story and audio clips, I got alarmed because I felt weird about that.
9662600	9666200	I never consented to any audio clips.
9666240	9670480	So that means these were illegally recorded? When and where and how?
9670480	9675320	I didn't know what he was talking about, I didn't know if this was just an empty threat to scare me even more,
9676440	9679560	or if something happened that I don't know about.
9679560	9682960	The only thing I can do is check what I have of security footage,
9682960	9686360	and I went through all of Saturday when he was at my house.
9686360	9693600	He was here for about five-ish hours, and out of those five hours that he was here, I used the restroom once.
9694240	9697400	And during that time that I slipped away to the restroom very, very quickly,
9697400	9703360	the one time that I did, without letting me know what he was doing, he took multiple pictures inside my house.
9703360	9707080	And then immediately he started looking around at the ceiling.
9707080	9712240	I didn't have any cool light fixtures up there, I just don't know what else would be up there other than security cameras.
9712240	9720200	Seeing that footage was shattering and so angering because after everything that he made me feel safe enough to tell him about,
9720200	9725640	I told him about the one thing that I don't talk to anyone about anymore.
9725640	9731320	And I don't know if I would be this alarmed if throughout our entire interactions,
9731320	9737840	I feel like he had never had any good or even harmless intentions with everything that he did.
9737840	9742680	The way that he did it, during the five hours he was here, the minute that I slipped away to the restroom,
9742680	9749280	you knew why I'm so paranoid, you know why I have such a hard time letting people into my home.
9749280	9754440	It was a very violating feeling, and it was just something that I don't think I'll ever be able to understand.
9754440	9758720	Now this is where it becomes more theoretical, because she shows clips from a deleted video,
9758720	9762320	which she postulates could contribute to a pattern of predatory behaviour.
9762320	9762820	Four.
9762820	9770320	Five hours wasted was nice enough to say, I'll eat whatever the f*** you want to eat, because I'm gonna get f*** sucked.
9770320	9776720	You know, like, okay, I'm gonna bend over because, you know, like, I'm gonna give you what you want,
9776720	9780560	or I'm gonna get what I want, and nothing happened.
9780560	9782680	Waiting to get my action.
9782680	9785280	Well, no wonder, dude.
9785280	9786400	You're a loser.
9798400	9800440	But you have to understand where I'm coming from, too.
9800440	9803320	But you have to understand where I'm coming from, too.
9803320	9806240	I'm clearly signalling to you, I am ready.
9806240	9808720	You are here for to be ready.
9808720	9813480	I'm not going to just grab it, because you will come back, and it's gonna be the little me too movement.
9813480	9814960	The little me too movement.
9814960	9817520	He's not here to be ready for you.
9817520	9820400	Nobody is here to be ready for you.
9820400	9822600	And it's not the little me too movement.
9822600	9832480	How dare you discredit an entire movement that the sole purpose was giving people a voice who didn't have a voice.
9832480	9841240	How dare you discredit the entire thing that saved so many people because you had a bad day in New York City.
9841240	9843160	The little me too movement.
9843160	9845440	Oh, no one's going to believe you.
9845440	9848480	No one's going to believe you because it was inappropriate.
9848480	9850040	And that's why you didn't grab it.
9850040	9852360	You didn't grab it because of the me too movement.
9852360	9855200	You didn't grab it because there was a hashtag on Twitter.
9855200	9860040	You didn't grab it because that's sexual assault if he didn't want you to.
9860040	9865720	She talks more about her personal life, and why she believes her personal experiences affected her perspective,
9865720	9869160	and although Stephanie acknowledges that it may seem trivial to some,
9869160	9872920	she feels that her responses were justified given the environment that Nick created,
9872920	9876120	and she felt particularly threatened by his demeanour and status,
9876120	9882680	the latter which he had demonstrably exploited by creating a joke amongst his friends regarding her in and out of sleep comment,
9882680	9886640	which she felt he had publicly used to intimidate and bully her.
9887080	9892920	One of the biggest reasons I was even scared to make this video was because I knew that it looked stupid.
9892920	9895920	Everything sounds dramatic.
9895920	9898400	Oh, really? You were scared? Why did you stay?
9898400	9899880	And there was nothing.
9899880	9902160	Like, I felt like I had...
9902160	9910360	I don't know why in any other situation nobody ever needs a reason to feel scared or unsafe or uncomfortable,
9910360	9912400	but I felt like I needed to have a reason.
9912440	9917880	And I didn't, and so I stayed, and I tried to make him less angry and not mad at me,
9917880	9919440	and I was scared he was gonna say,
9919440	9922800	then why did you stay if you were so scared after that?
9922800	9927600	There's just been a lot of online bullying, and I'm someone that...
9927600	9929120	I've been through high school bullying.
9929120	9931640	I talk about it a lot more on my other channel.
9931640	9934560	He knows it. I've talked about it with him before.
9934560	9940360	It just was a gross abuse of power and an abuse of his platform and his voice.
9940360	9943960	At first, I felt, again, like more shame and embarrassment
9943960	9947920	because a lot of the people that he tagged are people that he knew that I would say,
9947920	9950960	oh my God, I've watched her since high school, or oh, I love her, you know?
9950960	9952600	I did a collab with her.
9952600	9955120	And these are people that I respected.
9955120	9959600	I don't wanna believe that they know the full story of what he's done.
9959600	9963920	I also felt scared because now it felt like if I say something,
9963920	9965760	it's not just going up against Nick,
9965760	9968160	but look at all the friends he has.
9970760	9971840	Who do I have?
9971840	9974360	And I just felt like I couldn't say anything
9974360	9978640	because it would be going up against all of these people and...
9978640	9980920	I was telling them a story about someone who...
9980920	9983400	Something happened, someone did something to me,
9983400	9987040	and there was just a lot that broke my spirits.
9987040	9988640	Or I'm gonna get what I want.
9990640	9991960	And I was telling them the story,
9991960	9996680	and one of the inside joke from that story was in and out of sleep.
9996680	9999640	And you don't understand, but then I told a few other YouTubers,
9999640	10002520	I tagged them on Instagram, as well as my friends,
10002520	10005440	and they all know, I was like...
10005440	10007200	They know the story, and they...
10007200	10008200	The...
10011800	10014200	The major thing that they take away from that was the in and out of sleep.
10014200	10016160	In and out of sleep.
10016160	10019440	I've just been in and out of sleep, and I don't know what's going on,
10019440	10021040	but you know, I got things to do.
10021040	10023480	I just got, ah, I got things to do!
10023480	10025280	Have you been in and out of sleep?
10025280	10027600	In and out of sleep, oh my gosh.
10027600	10029840	In and out of sleep right now.
10029840	10031560	They're like, what the f...
10031560	10034960	That's the most obnoxious, bizarre thing I've ever heard, like, what the...
10046080	10048720	In and out of sleep, we turned something that really bothered me
10048720	10052720	into something that we can laugh about when we were at the club.
10052720	10056920	I'm telling you, I should have put this on YouTube, on YouTube,
10056960	10060040	but also, I mean, it's just, you have to laugh about things to get over things.
10060040	10061880	That's just how, what I believe.
10061880	10065080	She says that she'll be producing merchandise based around this joke
10065080	10069480	with the proceeds going to charity, and she finishes on this message.
10069480	10072960	One of the things that really stood out was the word audacity.
10072960	10075400	You won't believe the audacity people have,
10075400	10077880	but I have lots of receipts and audio clips.
10077880	10081680	The definition of audacity means rude or disrespectful behavior.
10081680	10085440	I know that Nick is really offended because I was being really rude
10085480	10089080	and self-serving, and I had the audacity to do a lot of things,
10089080	10093000	and I just want to apologize that I had the audacity to say no to you
10093000	10094200	because I felt unsafe.
10094200	10098800	I'm sorry that I had the audacity to open my doors and let you into my home,
10098800	10100200	and then you took advantage of that,
10100200	10103920	and I'm sorry that I had the audacity to make you feel like I changed my mind,
10103920	10107720	but I think it's really important that we all know that a yes is not all-inclusive.
10107720	10111680	Just because you say yes doesn't mean you're saying yes to everything
10111680	10112800	for the rest of forever.
10112800	10115480	That's incredibly predatory and manipulative.
10115480	10117320	What was the purpose of all of this?
10117900	10119120	To hurt Veronica?
10119600	10120520	To hurt me?
10121400	10122800	To get your dick sucked?
10122800	10126040	This was a devastating video for Nick in multiple capacities,
10126040	10129680	and although I'd heard mixed things about the video from the commentary sphere,
10129680	10132200	a few reservations we'll talk about in a moment aside,
10132200	10133360	it was effective.
10133360	10135120	With the observations made about Nick,
10135120	10139280	a lot of the behavior was completely in line of what many could previously observe,
10139280	10141760	and even without Stephanie's personal commentary,
10141760	10143960	it was hard to provide Nick with much magnanimity.
10143960	10146600	But hey, we had Nick's side around the corner,
10146600	10149840	maybe he'd be able to give himself an out.
10150240	10155400	All right, I have screenshots, I have photos, I have audio clips,
10155400	10161840	I have various pieces of the story that Stephanie decided to leave out of hers.
10162720	10165560	With that much evidence, what could go wrong?
10171760	10176560	INTRO
10176560	10181000	Stephanie's video was slightly harder to traverse than it may initially appear,
10181000	10184240	because some of the content is based on personal sentiment,
10184240	10188680	a lot of people just interpreted that personal sentiment with a particular harshness towards Nick,
10188680	10193000	due to the depiction of him in the situation and his pattern of previous behavior.
10193000	10196080	I'll dissect the whole that Nick dug himself into in a minute,
10196080	10198080	let's talk about the shovel he used to get there.
10198440	10201120	With the response video, you can generally go for two points,
10201200	10204920	you can make your perspective seem justified, a more achievable goal,
10204920	10208360	but if you're feeling extra spicy, like some nuclear noodles,
10208360	10211640	then you can make your detractors perspective seem unjustified,
10211640	10213600	and thus bring into question their intent.
10213600	10215920	However, if you went for the latter and failed,
10215920	10218760	it would likely jeopardize your own character even further.
10219120	10223880	In the video that is 1 hour 36 minutes, please end my suffering,
10223880	10225600	he rebuts Stephanie's points,
10225600	10229440	but not with the concise nature that he might have been previously renowned for.
10229480	10233760	Nick may have been smart, but he was a naturally calculated person,
10233760	10239360	and as noted with other dramas, often had trouble adapting to evolving circumstances.
10239360	10242000	The only reason he'd kept his head above water previously,
10242000	10244520	is because people didn't really ask enough questions,
10244520	10248560	but now he was under the microscope, a lot of his faults became clear.
10248920	10253280	The first mistake Nick makes is by removing the context from their relative points,
10253280	10257080	he decides to open the video by talking about the photos in her house,
10257080	10260800	and although a rather strange decision considering it's position in Stephanie's video,
10260800	10264160	it may be because it's one of the points he has a stronger rebuttal to.
10264160	10269040	Nick- There's no, no excuse to be taking photos of someone's home without their permission.
10269040	10272080	Why would you be taking photos? That's creepy, that's stalkerish.
10272080	10274760	Are you dangerous? Are you going to break in and steal a lamp?
10274760	10277800	Are you going to leak her? Why would you take photos?
10277800	10281280	And in Stephanie's video, she implied, well she said,
10281280	10284040	that she had gone to the bathroom, she used the restroom,
10284440	10289000	and when she came back, she had checked the security footage to see that I was taking photos of her house
10289000	10294360	without her knowledge, and therefore it made her question her safety,
10294360	10301280	the overall peace of mind in her home, and that's a lie, that is 100% a lie.
10301280	10304160	But even then, he's already giving erroneous facts,
10304160	10308240	in that clip he states that she checked the security footage after she used the restroom,
10308240	10310880	I'm not sure if that's intentional misinformation,
10310920	10316880	but she checked the security footage after Nick posted on his Instagram story about having a load of audio receipts,
10316880	10319120	which Stephanie stated she didn't know about.
10319120	10322520	Those are relevant details that are necessary to discerning intent.
10322520	10327000	Now Nick has strong grounds to defend his intent on this point, on principle.
10327000	10332200	Nick- And she's claiming that I was taking photos for an odd reason,
10332200	10336680	that she has no idea what it was for, and that's what made her feel unsafe,
10336680	10340680	but she was sitting right there as I took a photo, watching me.
10340720	10344480	In spite of Stephanie's DMs from November, which did show tangible anxiety,
10344480	10348880	it could be easy to forget, and this could have been chalked up to miscommunication.
10348880	10354600	Unfortunately, because Nick removes the context, and goes in with the claim that Stephanie was just telling a bare-faced lie,
10354600	10356600	it feels inherently mean-spirited.
10356600	10362200	Nick- What she's saying here is so incriminating, she's making it look like I did something without her knowledge,
10362200	10368360	that therefore threatened her peace of mind, or implied the overall safety of her home was in jeopardy.
10368360	10373160	Stephanie, you painted the stage for your viewers, that you had no idea I was taking photos,
10373160	10376160	and that was the reason you were questioning your safety.
10376160	10378160	That's the only thing you supposedly had on me.
10378160	10381560	Was it really the only thing she had on you? Think about this, Nick.
10381560	10384760	In fact, the first five minutes were just an uncomfortable viewing,
10384760	10387560	because Nick goes into it with the most cynical outlook.
10387560	10391960	And you knew that probably wasn't enough to emotionally sway everybody,
10391960	10398360	which is why you made half of your video discussing sexual assault, PTSD, the Me Too movement,
10398360	10401160	all of which have nothing to do with our collaboration.
10401160	10406760	It is so ethically wrong to insinuate that I was taking photos while you were in the bathroom,
10406760	10410160	and you had no idea as to why that was the case.
10410160	10414560	That is deliberate manipulation in order to sell a story.
10414560	10417960	Now, I'd spoken about Nick's habit to make things about himself before.
10417960	10421960	If we look past the rhetorical hyperbole of half of the video being about Stephanie's experience
10421960	10426760	when it takes up a significantly smaller amount, for someone so switched onto arguments and their premises,
10426760	10430360	he seems to completely neglect the fact that this video isn't just about his behaviour,
10430360	10435360	but equally how Stephanie interpreted his behaviour more dramatically due to her personal history.
10435360	10440360	Now, you can challenge its purpose as a formative point, or the frequency that it is used,
10440360	10445360	but you can't say that it's irrelevant because she directly draws parallels between coercive elements
10445360	10449160	of Nick's behaviour and her experience which explains her adverse reaction.
10449160	10453960	Stephanie also states that it's information that she disclosed to Nick, which provides the implication
10453960	10458560	that he had been insensitive to her experiences while making her visibly uncomfortable.
10458560	10463360	Her video is justifying her reaction as much as it is condemning Nick's action,
10463360	10466760	because she seems aware that it could come off as an overreaction.
10466760	10470960	This is something that Nick has done before himself, and this is relevant because Nick was threatening
10470960	10475160	to upload content where he presented his own context for Stephanie's behaviour,
10475160	10479760	a context probably much more negative. Understood? Jesus.
10479760	10486160	I wasn't looking around for suspicious things, I was admiring her furniture, admiring her,
10486160	10490960	and she says I don't have fancy light fixtures. I'm sorry, that's the first house I've been in that looks like that.
10490960	10495960	This is a multi-million dollar home. I was impressed, I was happy for you,
10495960	10503560	and I think you were happy to show it off to me. That shouldn't be used as material as to why you felt threatened by me.
10503560	10505560	Absolutely not.
10505560	10510760	Now, with that said, he has a reasonable explanation for why he took those photos on principle,
10510760	10516360	but the problem is he goes in so harshly against Stephanie that it's an immediate turn off for a lot of audiences,
10516360	10522960	even if he had a point to make. Stephanie Sue's video worked off the straightforward structure of some of the best exposés,
10523160	10530160	some of Nick's own exposés. Go in with a high burden of proof, make it seem like you did your best to deal with the situation professionally,
10530160	10536160	and eventually show the attrition of that mentality that pushes you past the threshold for passive acceptance.
10536160	10540760	Why would you lie about something like that? I don't understand, why would you lie about it?
10540760	10545360	I even took a selfie, I even took a selfie, look at me, and I sent it to my husband.
10545360	10549960	Oh, oh, and let me play you, let me play you what I sent to my husband.
10549960	10555560	Here's a screenshot of Orlin watching us do the house tour. Look, I'm literally pointing toward the couch.
10555560	10560160	This is innocent stuff, this was like fellowship, this was conversation.
10560160	10564560	Oh, look at my house, look at my sofa, where's it from? It looks beautiful. Orlin says, oh, I love it.
10564560	10569960	You know, we are YouTubers too, it's not like I'm the milkman coming to rob a lamp from her.
10569960	10573760	That's the thing, Nick seems so angry and it feels completely misplaced.
10573760	10578560	It's not like you couldn't have a point here, but Nick fails to include the context for Stephanie's point,
10578560	10582760	why she may feel uncomfortable around someone taking photos while she's not there.
10582760	10587160	His paraphrasing is weak, sometimes inaccurate, and his failure to account for context,
10587160	10591160	and even Stephanie's premise makes his anger seem excessive and unreasonable.
10591160	10596160	I don't think Stephanie's point is that strong on this run, but I also acknowledge that you could find it unnerving
10596160	10600360	that the one occasion that someone leaves the room unattended in the space of five hours,
10600360	10606360	a person decides to take pictures. I will add that Stephanie has repeatedly stated that she has the footage to share,
10606360	10610560	but as California is a two-party consent state, she would need explicit permission,
10610560	10612960	something that Nick didn't provide in this video.
10612960	10615960	It's not like I walked into her house like this.
10620960	10626560	Nick did talk about what you would see if she did release the footage, but that's not the same as explicit consent.
10626560	10631960	Nick knows how easy it would have been to be clear, so it leaves us speculating about what happened,
10631960	10636160	as much as it leaves us speculating about why Nick didn't provide consent.
10636160	10641360	This is how he set the tone for the video, and little spoiler, it doesn't get better.
10641360	10646360	And Stephanie is saying that I'm pressuring her to talk about what happened.
10646360	10650560	She's saying that she would never want to bring her up, she never brought her up before,
10650560	10652960	and she said quote, I'd have no reason to.
10652960	10658160	Pro tip Nick, when you say quote, it's typically meant to follow with an actual quote.
10658160	10663360	Over the next one and a half hours, Nick pretty much fumbles every point, and he does it for many reasons.
10663360	10669760	There's no real way to summarise this video, it's a disorganised mess, and to be honest, I expected better from Nick.
10669760	10673960	He goes off on multiple tangents and vague arguments which prove very little,
10673960	10679360	particularly in the second half, but I'll try and focus now on a few key points, and what they can tell us.
10679360	10683760	She wants her viewers to think she'd never take part in a discussion about Veronica,
10683760	10691160	while she forgot to mention and show in her text messages that she asked us, me and Zach,
10691160	10697760	to take part in a multi-video documentary about Veronica Wang, Shane Dawson style.
10697760	10699160	Let me read you what she said.
10699160	10703960	This is at the end of August, a couple of months ago, three or four months ago, and this is what she said.
10703960	10710360	So essentially, I want to address everything that she did that hurt everybody involved, starting from Shookbang,
10710360	10713760	and maybe finally get her to understand that she wasn't the victim here.
10713760	10717960	And I would also like to showcase a side of you that shows you're not just here for the drama,
10717960	10723160	but you're here for the underdogs, and the words she said against you hurt you, and not just angered you.
10723160	10727760	I would also like people to see a glimpse of vulnerability from Nikocado, obviously to your comfort.
10727760	10732160	I was just hoping to be an unbiased voice. It honestly seems like a little much.
10732160	10735760	I don't live there, I'd have to fly there, and if anything, a Shane Dawson documentary,
10735760	10740160	that's many different days of filming and shooting. I'm not really interested in spending weeks there for this.
10740360	10744360	Yeah, a collab where we eat and chat, but that's different than a documentary.
10744360	10749360	It would be hard for you, Stephanie, to be that unbiased voice, considering you were Veronica's friend,
10749360	10752960	and it was your own videos that started Shookbang making videos,
10752960	10757560	as well as the supposed advice you gave to Veronica to delete them.
10757560	10763360	Like at this point in time, no one even knows you stopped being friends, or that she treated you so poorly.
10763360	10769160	So we'll come across to the viewers as you trying to bring her back to being liked by everyone again, which could backfire.
10769160	10773160	She never even apologized to you, or anybody, so I don't think it's a good idea, just my thoughts.
10773160	10777160	As I noted, Nik has trouble adapting, and this situation was no exception.
10777160	10782160	A lot of his responses fell flat because it felt like they were prepared for a completely different video.
10782160	10787560	Following the apartment issue, he goes in on the point regarding Stephanie's willingness to talk about Veronica.
10787560	10791960	He first says that Stephanie wanted to do a docuseries in August about Veronica,
10791960	10796760	and then spends a few minutes going through receipts from three and a half months prior to the situation.
10796760	10800760	He then talks about how much she spoke about the situation when they first met.
10800760	10805760	Can I tell you, when I first met Stephanie Sue out for dinner, we were there for what, like four, five, six hours?
10805760	10811760	Do you think we were talking about the weather, talking about how to make an omelet, talking about what our favorite designer bag is?
10811760	10822560	It was Stephanie Sue going on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on about all of this stuff between her and Veronica.
10822560	10827960	I didn't even ask her. Zach didn't even ask her. She was, boom, vomiting it out.
10827960	10833560	She had this boiling up, like she says, looming over her heads. It's still looming over her head then,
10833560	10839560	and let me tell you, when I just two weeks ago was in Los Angeles, it was still looming over her head then too,
10839560	10840560	and I'm gonna get into that.
10840560	10846560	All of this seems rather irrelevant to be honest, and not satisfied, he then goes through his DMs with Zach Choi
10846560	10851560	around that time of the situation, where Zach voices his skepticism of Stephanie's intentions,
10851560	10855560	and then shares Zach's DMs with Stephanie, where she says she'd love to involve him.
10855560	10861560	And this is something else that pervades the video, this excruciating matter of fact tone, like he's spilling some tea,
10861560	10866560	but a lot of the time, he's missing the mark so badly, it's painful to watch.
10866560	10872560	It doesn't help that a lot of this content was months before, and one of the key takeaways you could draw from Stephanie's video
10872560	10875560	is that people are allowed to change their mind.
10875560	10881560	I could talk about how a docuseries with said person is very different to talking crap about them in a Mukbang video,
10881560	10883560	but I feel that would be overkill.
10883560	10889560	All I'll say is that one has a much stronger ability to start drama, the other has a much stronger ability to end it.
10889560	10894560	And then Zach's like, yeah, I'll be dead, or if I disagree with her, and then Zach says,
10894560	10900560	I feel like Stephanie is trying to get involved in the drama without being involved in the drama.
10900560	10903560	When she pitched the idea to me earlier, it threw me way off.
10903560	10905560	Let me repeat that to you again.
10905560	10911560	I feel like Stephanie is trying to get involved in the drama without being involved in the drama.
10911560	10916560	And then he sent me a screenshot, a screenshot of his text messages with Stephanie.
10916560	10922560	And this is what it says, Zach says to Stephanie, it's really up to Nick since I wasn't even involved to begin with.
10922560	10926560	And then Stephanie goes, I think I'm going to do it regardless.
10926560	10929560	This is someone who's saying, what did she say? I would never want to talk about her.
10929560	10932560	Nothing even happened. Nick's trying to start something out of nowhere.
10932560	10937560	This lady has so much upset feelings against Veronica Wang.
10937560	10943560	And let me tell you, it's a lot more than just pink hair dye that she was willing to make a Shane Dawson documentary.
10943560	10947560	Four part, two part, five part series hours long.
10947560	10950560	You think people make documentaries over hair dye?
10951560	10960560	Stephanie Sue was still so, so upset about Veronica Wang that she was willing to make a documentary about it,
10960560	10967560	a documentary, and stick Zach in there too for clicks, capitalising on something and opportunistic.
10967560	10971560	Reading through Stephanie's DMs about the idea, accepting that it might be opportunistic,
10971560	10974560	it mostly seems like an innocent attempt to resolve drama.
10974560	10977560	She certainly presents it as that, and then Nick brings in these DMs,
10977560	10981560	like him talking trash with someone else about a person is evidence.
10981560	10986560	The DMs themselves involve Nick and Zach agreeing that Stephanie is trying to give Veronica an out,
10986560	10993560	while Nick uses it as evidence to show that Stephanie would want to drag Veronica in an unrelated milk bank session.
10993560	11001560	I felt like I would never tell him that I wanted to talk about Veronica and specifically spill the tea.
11001560	11005560	It had always been about Shukbang. Me and Veronica's relationship didn't involve Nick.
11005560	11008560	Once again, I have to be the one to actually show clips in Nick's favour.
11008560	11013560	Now, I think Stephanie could have been a bit more upfront regarding her previous propositions,
11013560	11019560	however, Nick's evidence here would only explain why he may have brought it up once, before Stephanie allegedly rebuffed him.
11019560	11023560	Another text I'd like to show is a couple weeks later, on September 10th, I said,
11023560	11026560	and Stephanie is so slow at communication that I'm not going to pursue it anymore.
11026560	11030560	I don't want to be an annoying Kim texting her over and over, lol.
11030560	11034560	When she doesn't respond to me, I can take it as a clear indication that she's not interested.
11034560	11039560	She managed to look at her phone to get the appearance on Belove's channel, despite her busy move,
11039560	11041560	so it's not like she isn't on her phone.
11041560	11044560	And then Zach goes, yeah, I don't know what's going on with Stephanie.
11044560	11047560	I wonder who her actual friends are, lol.
11047560	11053560	The only point here that could be noted is that it's an appeal to Zach Choi's authority and neutrality,
11053560	11055560	but as we'll see, that soon backfired.
11055560	11061560	What people see of Stephanie Su on the internet is not the Stephanie Su that people off camera know her as.
11061560	11065560	That's also why people are probably uncomfortable with me, because I tell it like it is.
11065560	11069560	If I'm mean, if I'm an asshole, if I'm soaking up the drama because I like it, people already know that.
11069560	11071560	There's no sequence there, I tell ya.
11071560	11076560	But with Stephanie, her image, her persona on the internet is very like, I'm unproblematic.
11076560	11079560	I don't like to take part. I don't talk ill will on anybody.
11079560	11081560	When that's exactly what she's doing off camera.
11081560	11085560	Wow, people online are not the same people that they are offline.
11085560	11089560	The tea is truly scolding, Nick Ocado, I know, I know, I'm just fed up.
11089560	11092560	Unfortunately, nothing he really says here is particularly helpful.
11092560	11097560	The confusing thing is that there's not really much argument between what happened for most of the story,
11097560	11100560	they just talk about different stories that occasionally overlap,
11100560	11105560	and Nick acts like he's caught her out, which just ends up being the commentary equivalent of an awkward silence.
11105560	11109560	Later on the video, he shares more voice recordings with Carly Steele,
11109560	11112560	another friend of his, over Stephanie's claim that she felt uncomfortable.
11112560	11116560	She did provide permission, though I'm confused as to why.
11116560	11121560	In Stephanie's video, she says that she had to film all these videos, she had to do three videos,
11121560	11126560	we filmed one, and she had to keep pushing through, she was uncomfortable, she didn't know how to say no.
11126560	11132560	She eluded and insinuated that she was there by the way of me and my requests.
11132560	11138560	What she forgot to tell you was the truth, and the truth was, we were there because she asked us to be.
11138560	11143560	That was not in our schedule. Stephanie Sue invites herself into my collab with Zach.
11143560	11147560	She invites herself into it. That was not for her, it wasn't for her to be there,
11147560	11151560	and she did it over FaceTime while I was standing in Jollibee.
11151560	11153560	Hey, so you know how I did my collab with Zach yesterday?
11153560	11156560	Well, today was supposed to be our collab for my video, for my channel.
11156560	11159560	Well, Stephanie Sue just like invited herself into it.
11159560	11161560	So this is exactly what I was afraid would happen.
11161560	11165560	That's so f***ing rude, and like, the thing is too is you called it, like you f***ing knew, you knew.
11165560	11171560	It seems like, yeah, like she's just really f***ing selfish, and what's shitty is like they put you in an uncomfortable position
11171560	11174560	because they FaceTimed you with like both of you together and that puts you in an uncomfortable situation
11174560	11176560	because you can't say no, you look bad.
11176560	11182560	It's kind of like I think she knew what she was doing, she seems very manipulative, like manipulating her way into people's heads.
11182560	11187560	So that's the truth. I didn't pressure her to be there, I didn't pressure her into filming really late at night
11187560	11193560	where she was uncomfortable and she's never been out that late, and that is just not the truth.
11193560	11196560	Once again, I'm really confused as to the point of this.
11196560	11198560	Carly Steele has never spoken to Stephanie.
11198560	11202560	The conflict appears to have occurred in the morning before the Veronica Wang situation,
11202560	11206560	at which point Stephanie stated she didn't see any alarming issues.
11206560	11209560	There was a lot of filming and a lot of eating that day, and the first video went really well.
11209560	11212560	So obviously, I don't know if she's comfortable with being on the phone or not,
11212560	11215560	but I feel like an apology over the phone and talking things out over the phone
11215560	11219560	is a lot more like genuine and like down to earth than just like messaging her and be like,
11220560	11223560	But I do owe her an apology, and I owe everyone here an apology,
11223560	11225560	especially the people that think of me differently.
11225560	11229560	So I guess that that was my bad for commenting on a situation I didn't know about.
11229560	11232560	I definitely shouldn't have said like the whole, I don't know who raised her thing
11232560	11235560	because that was really out of line and really out of character for me,
11235560	11237560	and I don't know why the fuck I said that, and I'm very sorry.
11237560	11240560	I guess I was just trying to be as mad as Nick was.
11240560	11243560	I don't know, like I don't know, I don't know why I said that,
11243560	11247560	and it's like really disrespectful and kind of disgusting of me to say that, and I'll take the L on that.
11247560	11251560	I definitely am not bullying her in any way. I have never called her like names.
11251560	11253560	I've never been like, you're a bitch or like whatever.
11253560	11256560	I have not sent any of my fans to hit on her.
11256560	11260560	I was just someone that was kind of in the background hearing one side.
11260560	11265560	Carly Steele went on to apologise to Stephanie after audio clips were dropped in Nick's video,
11265560	11269560	and I'm still wondering what Nick expected, including these clips would prove.
11269560	11274560	Even if the situation was relevant, trash talk doesn't prove it happened the way you portrayed it,
11274560	11280560	and your friend has no stake in that situation, you've just unnecessarily dragged them in too.
11280560	11284560	It feels like Nick was trying to name drop people to encourage them to come to his side,
11284560	11286560	but it practically had the opposite effect,
11286560	11291560	because a fair few people that he involved just seemed completely allergic to being involved in actual drama.
11291560	11296560	Zach Choi is one of those people who repeatedly requested Nick to leave him out of the drama.
11296560	11302560	He had even made a public statement committing to neutrality, which angered a fair few of his fans at the time.
11302560	11307560	However, as we've observed, Nick was particularly keen to include his character judgments on Stephanie Sue,
11307560	11310560	once again appearing like a ham-fisted appeal to authority.
11310560	11313560	When Nick dropped the DMs without Zach's permission,
11313560	11317560	Zach snapped, and released a statement criticising Nick for not consulting him,
11317560	11322560	and releasing DMs of his own, which show Nick allegedly attempting to coerce a position out of Zach.
11322560	11327560	A lot of the DMs show Nick advocating for information that the other person appears to not be aware of,
11328560	11331560	and then those friends trusting Nick with that information,
11331560	11335560	and then Nick using that trust as evidence for why his portrayal must be accurate.
11335560	11340560	Nick's behaviour seemed to show the valued winning the fight more than the trust of many of his own friends,
11340560	11345560	and in turn pushing them away, by releasing DMs without consultation at all.
11345560	11349560	What makes this worse is that a lot of the DMs don't even seem particularly relevant,
11349560	11351560	other than providing character judgments,
11351560	11354560	one from a person that knows Stephanie from Nick's own comments,
11354560	11357560	and one from a person who has renounced those statements.
11357560	11361560	It felt like he was trying to justify why he didn't like Stephanie,
11361560	11363560	and that was one of the greatest failures of the video,
11367560	11369560	because it wasn't just why he didn't like Stephanie,
11369560	11375560	he shows these DMs, and spouts this rhetoric which gives the impression that he never liked Stephanie,
11375560	11379560	which brings into question why on Earth he had appeared to befriend her in the first place.
11379560	11384560	She's very self-centered, but very self-serving,
11384560	11387560	if she can stick her way into it any way she can, she does.
11387560	11390560	And so she FaceTimed me with them both together in the car,
11390560	11392560	on their way to pick up food for a collab,
11392560	11394560	when he was supposed to come over to collab with me,
11394560	11396560	and I hate when people do this shit, I didn't want a three-way,
11396560	11400560	I wanted one with Zach just like I had one with him on his channel, it's just not fair.
11400560	11404560	Well, two times ago when I was in LA, I remember she messaged me saying,
11404560	11408560	hey, I had this great idea, because another mukbanger named Kimmy was in town,
11408560	11411560	and she's like, how about let's do a four-way collab with me, you, Kimmy, and Honey,
11411560	11413560	and we'll put it on my channel.
11413560	11417560	And Honey doesn't like Stephanie Sue either, but she's all she cares about herself.
11417560	11420560	And Honey has never talked to her, she's never gotten to know her,
11420560	11422560	she literally just said, hey, can you be on my channel?
11422560	11426560	And it was all four of us that would get hella views, and she wanted her for her channel.
11426560	11430560	She'd never talked to us before, never asked how we were doing, never wanted to meet,
11430560	11433560	she just said come over and film, she just wanted to stick us on her channel,
11433560	11436560	she doesn't even like us, she just wanted to use us, we felt very used.
11436560	11439560	So I turned it down, so now this is happening all over again.
11439560	11444560	Stephanie Sue, out of nowhere, after telling me, no, I can't collab with you because you're too much drama,
11444560	11449560	pitched me an idea to collab with me, Honey Eats, Kimmy, and herself to put on her channel.
11449560	11453560	Honey Eats doesn't like her. Kimmy doesn't like her.
11453560	11456560	I didn't really like her, I didn't even know her.
11456560	11461560	I felt that she was very self-serving, doesn't take the time to get to know Kimmy or me or Honey,
11461560	11468560	ignores us, stands us up, but only asks for us, only reaches out to us if she wants something out of us.
11468560	11471560	There's a lot of people who already have this opinion about Stephanie Sue.
11471560	11474560	How she is on camera is not the real Stephanie Sue.
11474560	11479560	She's very sneaky. How she is off camera, when we did those three-way collabs,
11479560	11484560	she complained, she bitched, she moaned, she rolled her eyes.
11484560	11487560	She even kinda alluded to this, saying like, keep pushing forward.
11487560	11492560	It's like you invited yourself there. You could have said, actually, I changed my mind.
11492560	11496560	It was just ridiculous, and she did it for her own benefit.
11496560	11501560	So she could be on my channel, I get double her views, that she could be on Zach's channel in our collab,
11501560	11506560	because she knows when me and Zach last collaborated, it got a million something views.
11506560	11509560	She wanted to be part of that so that people could go to her page too.
11509560	11512560	Not only does he manage to drag his friends in against their will,
11512560	11516560	he reveals his own intentions to be rather crooked in befriending Stephanie Sue,
11516560	11520560	and brings into question his intent in his friendships with other individuals.
11520560	11525560	A lot of the DMs show Nick forcing a lot of assumptions, and being all-round instigator-y.
11525560	11528560	In an attempt to attack Stephanie, he attacks himself.
11528560	11533560	He cuts off the nose to spite the face, and the face wasn't even that pretty in the first place.
11538560	11543560	I feel so bad for Honey, because people think she was just picking on Stephanie out of the blue.
11543560	11549560	Stephanie has given her the middle finger for a very long time, she's taken some sponsorships from her,
11549560	11554560	she's never ever gotten to know her, she only contacts her when she wants something out of her,
11554560	11559560	and that's for Honey to talk about, if she wants to go into depth, there's a lot that goes on.
11559560	11565560	I just don't, please don't think that Honey, I convinced Honey Stephanie was a d-
11565560	11567560	Nick's video is a dumpster fire of responses.
11567560	11572560	There is a fair bit that I am gonna try and save for later, because he goes at Stephanie from various angles,
11572560	11575560	but it was exhausting, and not in a challenging way.
11575560	11580560	Zach told me that Stephanie told him that she was willing to clap with me now,
11580560	11586560	not the first time, not the second time, not the third time, maybe for a drama five-part docuseries on my channel,
11586560	11591560	but now she's willing to do it because the views kept going down, down, down, down, down.
11591560	11596560	You can look at her social blade, and her views have been going down for like almost half a year,
11597560	11604560	just steadily declining. Now it's worth it, and now she's willing to do it because it's Nikocado Avocado,
11604560	11609560	and she's gonna get clicks, because I am dramatic, because I am forthright, and I say too much,
11609560	11614560	and I like to spill the beans, she knows that it would have gotten attention,
11614560	11617560	and Zach told me that that's the reason she only decided to do it.
11617560	11622560	There is barely a single point in the video where he shows a clip from Stephanie Sue's upload,
11622560	11624560	and this leads to the most obtuse paraphrasing.
11624560	11633560	Her first video back was In-N-Out Burger. I find it peculiar, I find it odd, very strange, very unusual behavior,
11633560	11638560	coming from someone who sat on camera and said that what I did to her was, quote-unquote,
11638560	11644560	the worst experience she's ever had. Remember, she said she went to the bathroom and had the worst breakdown of her life,
11644560	11646560	and she couldn't even explain to her fiancé.
11646560	11653560	To be honest, what it felt like, and the only way that I've ever felt like this to any degree in my life,
11653560	11661560	prior to Nik, was a couple years ago, and I vowed I would never find myself in a position like that ever again,
11661560	11668560	where I felt like, no, really didn't have a lot of power, and I felt like it didn't matter if I was uncomfortable.
11668560	11676560	That night, I was really pushed into a really, really, really dark place that I never thought I would be in again.
11676560	11681560	I had a breakdown, and it was unlike any other breakdown I had.
11681560	11694560	It was one where I felt shame, guilt, because I did say, I did say I would talk about it, didn't I? I don't know, he said I did.
11695560	11700560	Now, I don't know Stephanie Sue, I don't know her intent, but with Nik's own video and the additional DMs,
11700560	11705560	it just looks like he's salty at the fact that he was beaten to the punch by a more tightly constructed exposé.
11705560	11710560	For her to go on camera and say that nothing really happened, and she didn't want to talk about it,
11710560	11714560	and it was a little annoying, but no big deal, that is completely, completely off base.
11714560	11721560	Completely off base. She told me in my apartment, she told me in the car, she told me at her house,
11721560	11724560	that we were going to discuss Veronica on my channel.
11724560	11729560	She didn't feel comfortable doing the documentary on her own, because me and Zach both turned her down.
11729560	11733560	So she was okay doing it with me, because let's face it, she said nothing.
11733560	11737560	Was it my business? Not really at first, but I felt bad for Shuk-Ben.
11737560	11740560	It became my business when Veronica went after me over and over and over,
11740560	11744560	and that's why when I grabbed the camera at the airport, which we'll get into, and I said,
11744560	11752560	Look, guys, I feel like this was a setup. This is why I feel this way, because she egged it on so rich off camera,
11752560	11758560	and when the camera went on and saying, Hey, Nick, drop the subject, or, Hey, move your hands, edit it out,
11758560	11763560	she sat there and was like, Oh, I'm so uncomfortable, so that people can look.
11763560	11768560	Oh, Nick, dragging poor, innocent, little, fluffy Stephanie down a road she would never go on.
11768560	11772560	He states that she was setting him up, but with the evidence, it appears to be completely the opposite.
11772560	11778560	The DMs between them in the group chat show him making assertions which appear to be done with the intent to corner Stephanie,
11778560	11780560	and pressure into saying something that might incriminate her.
11780560	11786560	Fortunately, she was extremely cautious on this front, and traversed a lot of the inflammatory language with a diplomatic finesse.
11786560	11791560	It seems pretty clear that Nick was planning his own video, and probably wanted to put Stephanie in a position
11791560	11795560	where he'd be able to frame her as rude, hypocritical, whatever he could pin her as.
11795560	11798560	He had all these receipts, probably with the plan to release them in the video,
11798560	11802560	but with Stephanie's video, his release of many of these ended up backfiring unbelievably.
11802560	11805560	A great example were his rants to Carly Steele.
11811560	11814560	In Stephanie's additional response video, yep, there's another.
11814560	11819560	With Zack's permission, she shares his DMs with Nick, which have Nick acknowledging that it wasn't just Stephanie
11819560	11823560	inserting herself into the situation, directly contradicting Nick's rhetoric,
11823560	11826560	and just shows how trash this trash talk was.
11826560	11831560	Zack said, I just don't want you to say something was her idea when it was mine lol.
11831560	11836560	Which is exactly what Nick did in his response video, he said that I pushed myself into the ASMR collabs.
11836560	11840560	And Zack is saying, well, maybe you shouldn't say that, because that was actually my idea,
11840560	11842560	and Nick did a thumbs down on it.
11844560	11848560	And then he said, I know, it's been a different time, I'm about to film TTYL.
11848560	11849560	So that's the truth.
11849560	11851560	She's very like, um, self-serving.
11851560	11853560	She seems very manipulative.
11853560	11855560	She's f***ing rude, like I don't know how these people were raised.
11855560	11856560	So that's the truth.
11856560	11861560	You're using private conversations that you had with your friends, talking badly about me,
11861560	11867560	it's a pattern of you posting people's private conversations in order to further your own narrative.
11867560	11872560	It feels like Nick was trying to set up the drama by appealing to the spontaneity of his rants,
11872560	11875560	when in fact, they were very calculated ways of setting a scene.
11875560	11879560	So with all this in mind, did Nick manage to make any indisputable points in his video?
11879560	11883560	Well, I can think of one actually, regarding the rice cake ASMR clip.
11884560	11889560	And so we filmed the third video at the end of the ASMR because it was a whispering one.
11889560	11895560	Nick turned to me and he said, is there anything else you'd like to say?
11895560	11900560	And I just remember feeling so gutted, like my heart had dropped to the ground
11900560	11904560	because I thought it was going to be another interrogation.
11904560	11906560	What would you like to say?
11910560	11911560	Thank you for watching us.
11911560	11917560	And so I said, thanks for watching us eat this food.
11917560	11919560	Stephanie, is there anything else you'd like to say?
11919560	11921560	Obviously I'm not saying it like that because we're whispering.
11921560	11925560	So I'm like, thank you, is there anything else you'd like to add?
11925560	11929560	And Stephanie's gesturing and putting her hand up as if she wants to say something.
11929560	11932560	And I'm like, okay, what would you like to add?
11932560	11939560	She uses that, she chops out the context and she uses it to say I was pressuring her
11939560	11943560	or making her feel uncomfortable, like I want to bring up Veronica again.
11945560	11949560	In an ASMR, what were we just going to whisper about her at the end of the video?
11953560	11954560	Thank you.
11958560	11959560	What do we do now?
11964560	11965560	Goodbye.
11965560	11966560	She's playing the flute.
11969560	11970560	Okay, ready?
11971560	11973560	What would you like to say?
11974560	11976560	Thank you for watching us eat this.
11977560	11981560	With the full clip, it clearly shows Stephanie gesturing with her hands
11981560	11984560	in a way that would imply she may want to add something,
11984560	11988560	which would probably provoke Nick's comment on where there was anything she'd want to add.
11988560	11991560	After having the displeasure of watching the clip a few too many times,
11991560	11995560	I believe she wanted to finish swallowing her food before they concluded the video.
11995560	11998560	I understand that in the moment she may have misinterpreted that comment,
11998560	12002560	and revisiting the clip to add into her video, it's surprising to me that she wouldn't have noticed.
12002560	12007560	She didn't respond to this in her second video either, and this led some to question her intentions.
12007560	12010560	Just ridiculous. She knows exactly what she was doing.
12010560	12014560	Do you think she didn't know how this would come across on screen?
12014560	12020560	She was trying to emotionally sway her viewers into saying I had predatory tendencies,
12020560	12022560	and of course it looks creepy because we're whispering.
12022560	12024560	Is there anything else you'd like to add?
12024560	12029560	You know, creepy, but we're whispering. Out of context, it looks even creepier.
12029560	12034560	And she did this on person, on purpose, to sell a story.
12034560	12036560	There are people out there who really don't like Stephanie Sue,
12036560	12039560	and to them, her video was another classic case of manipulation,
12039560	12042560	and some of Nick's narrative will inevitably stick with them,
12042560	12047560	because Nick's narrative is built on the assumption that she's doing all this stuff with self-serving mal-intent,
12047560	12052560	especially shown in her reaction, such as the merch, the extra content, the emotion, the story.
12052560	12055560	However, a lot of the evidence also stood on its own,
12055560	12058560	so you didn't have to necessarily like or dislike Stephanie Sue
12058560	12061560	to see how unpleasant and coercive Nick was being.
12061560	12063560	Like Trisha Paytas, it was too late,
12063560	12067560	and he had messed up more than enough for people to take a look at these narratives against him,
12067560	12070560	and unlike Trisha Paytas, Stephanie's further response video
12070560	12073560	pointed out multiple specific flaws in his response,
12073560	12075560	requested permission to release further evidence,
12075560	12080560	requests that Nick never responded to, and even included new evidence on its own.
12080560	12083560	Now, the second thing I'm going to be referencing is my home security footage.
12083560	12086560	Now, I'm unable to release it to the public because California law,
12086560	12090560	but Nick, give me your consent because you claim that I lied about so many things,
12090560	12092560	whereas my home security footage says otherwise.
12092560	12095560	So give me your consent if you truly think I'm a liar,
12095560	12097560	if you truly think I'm a manipulator,
12097560	12101560	if you truly think that your side is the truth, let me release the footage.
12101560	12103560	But now he claims the minute he came over, I said,
12103560	12105560	did you see my oven? Did you look at it?
12105560	12109560	He spoke about my oven prior to coming over to my house.
12109560	12111560	Like a five-layer oven? Who uses that?
12111560	12114560	Now, I, without your consent, cannot release the security footage
12114560	12118560	of you taking pictures when I go to the restroom, but you release this picture.
12118560	12122560	And if you zoom in closely, you're alone in my kitchen taking this picture.
12126560	12128560	So you took the picture when I was in the bathroom.
12128560	12132560	I have never recorded anyone ever without their consent.
12132560	12135560	I took a photo with her consent.
12135560	12137560	There's another thing actually on Zach's channel.
12137560	12139560	At the end of it, there's like one piece of chicken left.
12139560	12143560	And the last scene, we had discussed it was Stephanie's idea
12143560	12146560	that she would have the last leg and I would look at her like,
12146560	12150560	ooh, what you doing? Because I'm, you know, the fat pig that loves to eat.
12150560	12153560	And it was literally following what me and Trisha had done,
12153560	12157560	where we sat there with our noodles and we looked at each other and we glared.
12157560	12159560	Well, people are taking that clip now and saying,
12159560	12163560	ah, here's proof of Nick looking at Stephanie all creepily.
12164560	12167560	And that was her idea. I didn't even, I didn't even,
12167560	12172560	I didn't even realize until when I watched the video that I was like,
12172560	12174560	she wasn't looking back at me either.
12174560	12178560	It was a YouTube video. I was, there was no thought into it.
12178560	12182560	Looking at each other, she didn't look at me and I say to myself,
12182560	12185560	why didn't she, why would she say to do this?
12185560	12187560	Where we look at each other who's going to go for the last chicken leg.
12187560	12189560	And when the cameras are rolling,
12189560	12192560	she just looks at the screen as if she doesn't know what I'm doing over there.
12193560	12195560	Like what the hell, man.
12195560	12199560	This is one of those moments where I saw this video and you had said this
12199560	12202560	blatant lie with so much conviction, no evidence,
12202560	12207560	just such a strong voice that I was like, did I do that?
12207560	12211560	And so I reached out to Zach and he has the full unedited version of that.
12211560	12212560	And this is what happened.
12212560	12214560	I got you some good comments.
12215560	12216560	So she had the last thing, right?
12216560	12219560	We're eating and I was just sitting here and I was going like this.
12220560	12224560	So are you lying or is that footage lying?
12224560	12227560	Now the next thing that he brings up in his video is about Veronica.
12227560	12229560	The way that he approached this topic,
12229560	12233560	I thought was so incredibly manipulative because he made it seem like I have
12233560	12234560	this dirty little secret.
12234560	12237560	So I'm going to read to you guys some of the text messages that he showed
12237560	12240560	because he failed to read a lot of the important parts of it.
12240560	12243560	I wanted to make this docu-series and I wanted to highlight not only
12243560	12244560	everything that happened,
12244560	12247560	but I also wanted to highlight some of the important parts of it.
12247560	12250560	I wanted to highlight not only everything that happened with Shookbung and
12250560	12252560	including what happened between Veronica and I,
12252560	12254560	but also all of the personal conflicts that were involved.
12254560	12257560	I wanted it to be less drama focused,
12257560	12260560	but more about the personal struggles behind all of the decisions that were
12260560	12262560	made. And to give you guys some perspective,
12262560	12265560	this is what I said to Veronica, which Nick has never seen.
12265560	12266560	You know,
12266560	12268560	I would also like to showcase the side of you that shows that you're not just
12268560	12269560	here for the drama,
12269560	12272560	but you're here for the underdogs and the word she said to you hurt you and
12272560	12273560	not just angered you.
12273560	12276560	I would also like people to see a little glimpse of vulnerability from
12276560	12278560	Nikocado, obviously to your comfort,
12278560	12281560	just like how my perspective changed when I actually got to meet you in
12281560	12282560	person.
12282560	12287560	I don't know how he took this and twisted it so out of context to make it
12287560	12292560	seem like I am obsessed with Veronica and I need to get an apology from her
12292560	12295560	and she did me so dirty and I just will not let it go.
12295560	12298560	That is what I told the group chat and that is what I told Veronica.
12298560	12301560	And Nick claims that I didn't do it because Nick didn't want to be a part of
12301560	12304560	it. In reality, Veronica shut me down.
12304560	12305560	She's moved on. She's thriving.
12305560	12308560	If you don't know the difference between exposing someone,
12308560	12314560	a tea video spilling the tea versus having a productive adult conversation,
12314560	12315560	then I don't know.
12315560	12316560	That seems like it's on you.
12316560	12323560	It was Stephanie Sue going on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
12323560	12325560	about all of this stuff between her and Veronica.
12325560	12326560	I didn't even ask her.
12326560	12327560	Nick,
12327560	12332560	you went on and on and on and on and on about Veronica in the videos that you
12332560	12333560	made about her.
12333560	12335560	You went on and on about her in my DMs.
12335560	12339560	You went on and on and on about her at dinner when we first met and you went
12339560	12345560	on and on and on about her in that footage of that mukbang that you refused
12345560	12346560	to release.
12346560	12348560	So please, you have my full consent.
12348560	12350560	Just two weeks ago was in Los Angeles.
12350560	12352560	It was still looming over her head then too.
12352560	12353560	And I'm going to get into that.
12353560	12355560	She's giving Veronica a lot of credit here.
12355560	12359560	An opportunity for all of us to right our wrongs and dig deep into meaningful
12359560	12360560	conversation, blah, blah, blah.
12360560	12361560	Okay.
12361560	12365560	So do I hate Veronica and I have this thing looming over my head or am I
12365560	12366560	trying to have deep,
12366560	12370560	meaningful conversations and am I giving Veronica too much credit?
12370560	12371560	Which one is it?
12371560	12373560	Pitched me an idea to collab with me,
12373560	12376560	HoneyEats, Kimmy and herself to put on her channel.
12376560	12379560	Now, just so he doesn't try to take this out of context again,
12379560	12380560	like I had mentioned,
12380560	12383560	just me doing a video with Nick would make it seem like I'm taking a side in
12383560	12384560	the drama.
12384560	12387560	Whereas me doing a video with Veronica and Nick and talking about everything
12387560	12389560	that's happened with everyone that is involved.
12389560	12391560	That's just having an adult conversation.
12391560	12394560	I actually felt bad for turning down the collab with just you.
12394560	12395560	And at the same time,
12395560	12397560	Kimmy had reached out and said that she was going to be in LA.
12397560	12399560	And so I thought this would be a cool idea.
12399560	12401560	Now, usually when YouTubers collab,
12401560	12404560	they do one video for every single person's channel.
12404560	12408560	So please don't make it look like I'm just trying to get AdSense money when
12408560	12409560	you're the one that reached out first.
12409560	12411560	I felt that she was very self-serving.
12411560	12413560	You're the one that reached out to me.
12413560	12415560	You're the one that asked to collab.
12415560	12417560	When apparently you didn't even like me.
12417560	12419560	HoneyEats doesn't like her.
12419560	12420560	Kimmy doesn't like her.
12420560	12421560	Again,
12421560	12424560	using other people's words publicly to hurt and humiliate other people.
12424560	12426560	But I didn't know that at the time,
12426560	12428560	but you knew that you didn't like me at the time,
12428560	12432560	but you still wanted to collab so that our collaboration videos would get
12432560	12434560	views. Who's really self-serving?
12434560	12437560	My first impression of Stephanie was very self-serving.
12437560	12438560	I didn't give her a gift.
12438560	12440560	We were just going to hang out and get to know each other.
12440560	12441560	That was my first impression.
12441560	12444560	Like warm and bubbly, gave me a hug, said hello.
12444560	12445560	Very self-serving.
12445560	12447560	Little welcome to Los Angeles gift for me.
12447560	12449560	And I'm like, wow.
12449560	12451560	She seems like she'll be a nice person.
12453560	12454560	Very.
12454560	12455560	So that's the truth.
12455560	12456560	So which one's the truth?
12456560	12458560	I didn't really like her.
12458560	12463560	I love Stephanie Sue because I don't like it is in Stephanie's video saying
12463560	12464560	she doesn't know how to say no to me.
12464560	12467560	She's so afraid for, she said no to me lots of different times.
12467560	12469560	She said no to me over dinner.
12469560	12471560	Look at what happened when I did say no to you.
12471560	12474560	And then during this group chat, when you said awesome,
12474560	12476560	when would you like to reschedule?
12476560	12481560	Prior to doing that, you had already texted Zach privately saying,
12481560	12484560	notice how her text tests didn't mention rescheduling LMAO.
12484560	12486560	I'm exposing her tonight.
12486560	12489560	And then you proceeded to post all of these on social media.
12489560	12493560	I did it because I was saying, look, I have people on my side.
12493560	12496560	So look at what happens when I say no to you.
12496560	12498560	Move me off the next day for our collabs.
12499560	12502560	You know, this is where a lot of my frustration was coming from.
12502560	12505560	I texted you in the group chat at 5.05 and I said,
12505560	12508560	I know that you're in LA for only a couple more days and have a lot scheduled.
12508560	12510560	Again, I'm so sorry for today.
12510560	12512560	And I hope you're able to enjoy the rest of your day.
12512560	12513560	That was at 5.05 PM.
12513560	12519560	At 5.18 PM, which is you texted Carly Steele saying,
12519560	12522560	bitch, I'm being ghosted by Stephanie Sue right now.
12522560	12525560	I am so sorry that I ghosted you for 13 minutes.
12525560	12528560	And now she's willing to do it because it's Nikocado Avocado
12528560	12529560	and she's going to get clicks.
12529560	12532560	Earlier you said that I wanted to do a collab with four people,
12532560	12535560	with you, me, Kimi and Hyunee and post it on my channel
12535560	12537560	because I want views and money.
12537560	12542560	But then now you're saying that I pushed my way into a collab on Zach's channel
12542560	12546560	because that would get more views from me, which means more exposure.
12546560	12549560	But that's contradicting with your text messages with Zach.
12549560	12553560	But on top of that, I think I would have done just fine on Zach's channel without you.
12553560	12557560	She put a sale on every single one of her items.
12557560	12560560	I didn't just put a sale on it.
12560560	12566560	I got a text message Saturday, December 21st, and this was from my manager at Fanjoy.
12566560	12568560	She's never had a sale there before.
12568560	12571560	She rarely uses their logos, Pizza Hut, Little Caesars,
12571560	12574560	because it's subliminal marketing and that comes at a high price.
12574560	12578560	And she says unless a company is paying her for that service,
12578560	12580560	she's not going to hand it to them.
12580560	12581560	This is a lie too.
12583560	12586560	Why do you keep speaking for me? I never said that.
12592560	12594560	You say it was the first time for me, so it's like,
12594560	12596560	oh, she planned it because it's the first time she did this.
12596560	12601560	It was also a first that I've never gone more than two days without posting on both of my channels.
12601560	12604560	I've never made a video like that about another influencer.
12604560	12605560	That was a first.
12605560	12608560	I've never felt scared of another influencer.
12608560	12609560	That was a first.
12609560	12612560	So, yeah, there was a lot of firsts.
12612560	12618560	I don't know why you would think that all of a sudden I wanted to have this master plan to expose Nick for something.
12618560	12620560	Oh, and I know I've mentioned this before,
12620560	12626560	but appealing to Zach's authority is still one of the most astounding misfires in YouTube drama history.
12626560	12628560	She told me in my apartment, she told me in the car,
12628560	12633560	she told me at her house that we were going to discuss Veronica on my channel
12633560	12636560	because she egged it on so rich off camera.
12636560	12639560	These happened the night when I got home from the collab.
12639560	12642560	We're talking about if you were going to post the footage
12642560	12646560	because at this point we were even scared to ask you to not post it.
12646560	12649560	And then Zach said, that's what makes me think he doesn't care.
12649560	12655560	It's so crazy too because I asked him privately if he was going to go in about Veronica and he said no.
12655560	12658560	I asked him so many times what you guys would even talk about
12658560	12664560	because he always said he'd stay away from Veronica because he knew it would make you uncomfortable.
12664560	12668560	That's why I was so surprised when he said he wanted to clear the air and talk about it.
12668560	12671560	He made it look like you really wanted to talk about her so bad.
12671560	12673560	You planned the discussion ahead of time.
12673560	12676560	You're saying that I wanted to talk so much about Veronica,
12676560	12680560	but then you told Zach that you weren't going to talk about Veronica and I would be uncomfortable.
12680560	12682560	And you knew that. Which one's the truth?
12682560	12688560	One of the most shattering new pieces of evidence was the alleged person who Nick spoke about in his deleted New York video,
12688560	12692560	offering his story to another video if necessary, with receipts.
12692560	12698560	This was particularly interesting as I'd initially dismissed this video as being a played up act from Nick's persona,
12698560	12702560	something that many mukbang creators, Stephanie included, had been known for doing,
12702560	12706560	often told through the lens of a younger Stephanie known as Stippetty.
12706560	12708560	So I go into his closet,
12712560	12714560	I have a pair of scissors from his desk,
12714560	12717560	and I cut a hole on the butt of every one of his drawers that he had.
12717560	12721560	It wasn't even like an organised cut, like I stacked them together, I like folded them, cut them,
12721560	12726560	because this guy was going to get emotional, he was obsessed with his drawers, like I said.
12726560	12729560	However, it appeared that there was a deeper story behind the video,
12729560	12732560	and possibly even more that could be said about Nick's character.
12732560	12738560	So I posted the video, and within a couple hours I got an email and a DM from someone,
12738560	12743560	and they showed me proof that they had met Nick in New York,
12743560	12748560	and they showed me pictures of their Snapchat between him and Nick, talking about that date.
12748560	12750560	Nikocado did it to me.
12750560	12753560	I am that boy that little me too video is about.
12753560	12757560	I would love to talk to you about it, we have a lot in common, I have all the screenshots as well.
12757560	12761560	And then he showed me screenshots of Snapchat and a picture that he took with Nick.
12761560	12767560	I was so scared, because he kept making all these posts about how he was going to tell this big story about me,
12767560	12771560	and I kept begging him to not post anything about me because unlike him,
12771560	12774560	I'm just a regular person with no level of fame.
12774560	12780560	In the original video, he showed me, but with an emoji over my face, and proceeded to call me a loser.
12780560	12786560	It was just so crazy, because like he did to you, he made me feel so comfortable in person when we first met.
12786560	12792560	We talked all night, and then when I left, he gave me a hug and said it was nice meeting you,
12792560	12796560	and I said it was nice meeting him too.
12796560	12798560	So I thought we left on good terms.
12798560	12803560	Then on Snapchat, he told me he was pissed that I didn't hook up with him.
12803560	12807560	And I was so so confused, because I thought we left happy.
12807560	12813560	And then he went and filmed that rant video about me, and he got so much hate for it, he took it down.
12813560	12819560	And then he made another one about me, but once again got hate, and took it down.
12819560	12826560	But it's scary, because we filmed a regular video, so he has that footage of me, in addition to some naked pictures.
12826560	12831560	I was so happy when it was all over, because he could have destroyed me, and still could.
12831560	12836560	I personally think that that was highly relevant to Nick's pattern of behavior,
12836560	12840560	and if I hadn't made that video, I wouldn't have spoken to this guy from New York.
12840560	12847560	I wouldn't have known that he felt exactly the way I felt, scared, confused, threatened, bullied.
12847560	12851560	So yes, I think it's important to point out people's patterns of behavior,
12851560	12856560	especially if it's a creator who's using their platform to threaten, and to bully others.
12856560	12860560	If something comes up where he attacks you or something, and you want me to tell my story,
12860560	12863560	I'd consider doing it, because he really needs to be stopped.
12863560	12868560	With all this on the brink, Nick didn't respond, and decided to move on from Stephanie's suit.
12868560	12873560	This was maybe because he wasn't sure what to say, or maybe he thought he couldn't turn perspective around.
12873560	12877560	But in this instance, it seems that Stephanie had won the battle of character attacks.
12877560	12880560	To be honest, I can understand why someone may have a problem with Stephanie's commentary.
12880560	12884560	If you don't like her, then you will receive the impression that she's manipulating her situation
12884560	12889560	to be much worse than it is to expose Nick, and there have been some interesting criticisms,
12889560	12893560	particularly for her first video, but for me, because she spoke from her personal perspective,
12893560	12896560	and separated a lot of the facts from her own personal interpretation,
12896560	12900560	it made it difficult for me to draw any clear character inferences.
12900560	12903560	It's a carefully worded video with strong themes for the most part.
12903560	12908560	Although that approach could be read as orchestration, it would also be the right way to go about making a video like this,
12908560	12911560	so it ultimately comes down to how you read her intent.
12911560	12915560	In many ways, it was exactly like what Nick did in his Trisha Paytas video.
12915560	12917560	So what was the difference here?
12917560	12922560	Well, the difference was that with context, Trisha's actions didn't look half as bad as Nick had portrayed them,
12922560	12928560	whereas with a few exceptions here, most of Nick's behaviour appeared to be exactly as presented and proven by Nick himself.
12928560	12932560	The only weaker point of this video, in my opinion, is the photos Nick took,
12932560	12936560	which Stephanie attacks quite harshly as a breach of personal security.
12936560	12939560	When I did go to the restroom, you did take pictures behind my back,
12939560	12944560	and I didn't approve of those pictures, and you kept trying to make it seem like I'm crazy,
12944560	12947560	I'm a manipulator for being scared of you releasing these pictures,
12947560	12952560	so then you went on to release the exact pictures that I would never want on the internet.
12952560	12957560	You released a picture of my kitchen with my security feed straight dab in the middle,
12957560	12959560	and you didn't have the courtesy to blur it out.
12959560	12961560	I don't know what you were interested in that picture.
12961560	12965560	Was it the kitchen cabinets? Because you could have gotten more of the cabinets from a different angle.
12965560	12969560	Was it the curtain? Because you could have gotten more of the curtain from a different angle.
12969560	12972560	Although I don't think Nick should have released pictures at all without permission,
12972560	12975560	it's probably worth noting that you have broadcast the house prior,
12975560	12979560	and such images are accessible, partly by your own doing.
12979560	12982560	It would have helped make the point more precise, so you convey your issue.
12982560	12985560	Certain claims that Stephanie had labelled Nick a sexual predator,
12985560	12988560	or at least implied, which I expected to see in the video,
12988560	12990560	I didn't really feel stacked up.
12990560	12994560	She defines the parallels pretty clearly, and also clarifies this position in her second video.
12994560	12998560	I never implied that Nick sexually harassed me.
12998560	13001560	I never implied that Nick did anything illegal.
13001560	13006560	I never implied that Nick committed crimes towards me, or towards anybody else.
13006560	13008560	I feel like a lot of us run off patterns.
13008560	13012560	I don't know if I'm the only one, but if someone makes a mistake, you forgive them.
13012560	13017560	But if they continue to do the same, same thing over and over and over again,
13017560	13020560	and they hurt people every single time,
13020560	13023560	I think that's very dangerous, and I think that's very alarming.
13023560	13026560	I do think the whole Dick Suck line was a bit unnecessary,
13026560	13029560	although I acknowledge its use was more dramatically motivated.
13029560	13033560	Other points, such as hypocrisy relating to a mockery of Nick's stamina,
13033560	13036560	Other points, such as hypocrisy relating to a mockery of Nick's stamina,
13036560	13039560	while criticising his use of the In-N-Out joke, are not unreasonable,
13039560	13042560	but they're extracted from the context of the points as well.
13042560	13046560	She took a part where I was stuttering all my words, and made fun of it.
13046560	13049560	It wasn't that big of a deal, I'm not going to lose sleep over it.
13049560	13053560	Honestly, if this problem wasn't happening, I wouldn't even think twice over it.
13053560	13056560	I'm only bringing this up because it's very peculiar.
13056560	13058560	She's trying to have this campaign against bullying,
13058560	13060560	and she would never want to bully someone,
13060560	13068560	and I'm trying to do this benevolent thing where I turn this terrible, terrible phrase into something happy and good.
13068560	13071560	Not only did she not say, hey viewers don't bully either,
13071560	13076560	she didn't say that, but she also essentially poked fun at me too.
13076560	13079560	But she's thinking that I was such a bully, bully, bully,
13079560	13082560	but I didn't put it on YouTube, it was on my Instagram,
13082560	13085560	and no one knew what that was about, except for like three or four people.
13085560	13089560	And then she put that on her video, which got viewed six million times.
13090560	13095560	Of course people are going to see that as license to go to my channel and add fuel to the fire.
13095560	13101560	The mocking of a person's speech errors is something that could be levelled towards most creators as a universally comprehendable joke.
13101560	13102560	It's obvious.
13102560	13107560	The In-N-Out joke was an inside joke which really had little use in being public,
13107560	13110560	which is why the argument was made that its utilisation was more malicious.
13110560	13113560	Equally, that's why she had no trouble making charity merch out of it,
13113560	13116560	because when revealed, the joke loses its power.
13116560	13121560	It doesn't mean that these points are invalid, but because there's rationale behind the other side,
13121560	13125560	a tone of slam-dunk righteous anger will likely go down like a lead balloon.
13141560	13144560	I understand the use of certain buzzwords may blur the line,
13144560	13149560	and definitely cause some more zealous community members to use the video to make more harmful statements.
13149560	13151560	It could be a bit irresponsible in that regard,
13151560	13154560	but personally speaking, as someone with similar background to Stephanie,
13154560	13159560	being placed in positions where you feel that saying no could have greater consequence can be really upsetting,
13159560	13162560	and I don't think she conveyed that incorrectly.
13162560	13165560	Whether the framing was too harsh on Nick's intentions is another question,
13165560	13167560	based on Nick's own knowledge of Stephanie's background.
13167560	13170560	Stephanie stated that she had informed Nick of her history,
13170560	13173560	but it would be easy to forget, and it depends who you believe.
13173560	13177560	There was also uncertainty about whether this could have been resolved elsewhere or not,
13177560	13178560	and how it could have been handled.
13178560	13181560	Valid questions, I'll say, which I'll save until the end.
13181560	13184560	Regardless of the answer, one thing was certain.
13184560	13188560	Nick was under fire like never before, and he had no clue how to deal with it.
13188560	13199560	Over 6 million people have viewed this video.
13199560	13203560	I just checked. 6 million people from around the world.
13203560	13208560	I certainly don't have 6 million people out there who know who I am.
13208560	13212560	There aren't 6 million people who know who Stephanie is.
13212560	13217560	I mean, I don't even have 2 million subscribers, let alone 6.
13217560	13224560	That leaves for millions of people to discover and learn who I am
13224560	13229560	from direct avenue of this video, which is fine.
13229560	13236560	You can make videos about me all you want, but the title is why you're scared of me.
13236560	13243560	Millions of people are coming to this video to learn why this girl who's crying and holding herself,
13243560	13246560	which, by the way, the thumbnail doesn't even appear in the video,
13246560	13250560	why she's scared of me.
13250560	13254560	And what do they see when they click it to learn why?
13254560	13259560	They see a clip of me taken out of context of me saying to her,
13259560	13261560	I hope you can trust me, or something along those lines,
13261560	13263560	oh, we can trust each other now.
13263560	13270560	There's another clip of me taken out of context making comments about the Me Too movement.
13271560	13275560	I'm saying that because of how she put this on the internet,
13275560	13280560	I'm now gonna have to live with people calling me a predator for God knows how long.
13280560	13284560	And she knows that most people are not gonna watch that whole video either.
13284560	13287560	45 minutes, 50 minutes, that's a very long time.
13287560	13291560	One thing that Stephanie briefly touched on in the last clip but otherwise didn't mention
13291560	13294560	was a lot of Nick's points about the calculated nature of her video,
13294560	13298560	how certain things were added for theatrics, and he's not entirely wrong,
13298560	13303560	but it's the gauntlet which has been laid down by numerous videos, Nick's own included.
13303560	13309560	She knows what she was doing, that's not an accident, that's not an accident at all,
13309560	13313560	which is why the tags have Nikocado Avocado High, I know you see this,
13313560	13317560	which is why she liked my post about exposing her,
13317560	13324560	which is why she deliberately told me to look at her, and it feels like I was set up, it's really crazy.
13324560	13329560	Nick's own videos showed that audiences cared a hell of a lot about how information is conveyed,
13329560	13331560	often more than the information itself.
13331560	13336560	Nick was a toxic person for multiple reasons, and so when this observable toxicity
13336560	13341560	was paired with his own formula and used against him much more effectively than he ever used it,
13341560	13346560	it may have been ironic, but it was also not in the slightest bit surprising that this was the outcome.
13346560	13350560	I can't pry it into Stephanie's mind, but it would not surprise me
13350560	13354560	if Stephanie had made the video partly because she anticipated Nick making his own,
13354560	13358560	which I think he definitely was. Stephanie had smartly handled Nick's instigator-y behaviour
13358560	13362560	by providing him with as little cause for conflict as possible,
13362560	13365560	which is why she stuck around and attempted to complete the collabs,
13365560	13367560	because tonally that was the best thing to do.
13367560	13371560	She tried to make it seem like it wasn't an issue, but Nick knows how to generate drama,
13371560	13373560	even when there may not appear to be any.
13373560	13377560	The Stephanie Sue good girl isn't as good as you think is great clickbait,
13377560	13380560	so she went ahead with her pre-emptive strike.
13380560	13385560	He'd go on to say that he was over it by the 19th of December in a video regarding Zach Choi.
13385560	13390560	And I literally, I told him, I remember telling him in the car when we almost pulled up to her place,
13390560	13393560	I was just like, and by the way, I don't want to think about it anymore, it's off my chest,
13393560	13395560	it's done it over with, it is what it is.
13395560	13400560	But that doesn't explain why he uploaded a video called I'm Exposing Someone on the 20th.
13402560	13405560	But some people need a good reality check.
13405560	13408560	Excuse me, I don't even like exposing people.
13409560	13411560	It's so exhausting and stuff, but...
13414560	13416560	I was really screwed over, so...
13417560	13422560	Nick indulged in the exposed culture, he made multiple videos exposing individuals,
13422560	13425560	he gave people the idea that this is what he enjoyed,
13425560	13429560	and then was exposed in the process of attempting to expose someone else,
13429560	13433560	and then went ahead with attempting to expose them anyway, only further exposing himself.
13433560	13437560	Nick's whole brand was under fire, so his multiple personas seemed to go into overdrive.
13437560	13444560	I'm not looking to convince you not to watch him or that he's terrible,
13444560	13453560	I'm just letting you know that my soul tells me that he helped Chicken Nugget bring this onto me.
13454560	13462560	They're both very smart, they're so smart, and they know how the internet works,
13462560	13468560	they know exactly what to say to be very careful,
13468560	13472560	but enough that allows people to draw the conclusions.
13472560	13476560	On the commentary front, Nick uploaded multiple more videos responding to people,
13476560	13479560	he says he was set up, but no one really bought it.
13479560	13483560	The DMs don't come out in his favour, his own evidence doesn't come out in his favour.
13483560	13486560	One DM that I often think is overlooked is this one.
13486560	13490560	When Stephanie apologises for any misunderstanding in the group chat with Zack,
13490560	13492560	and states that she was not comfortable talking about Veronica,
13492560	13496560	Nick appeals to the comments that she made on Saturday at her home.
13496560	13500560	If she was egging this discourse of Veronica on up until the video on Sunday,
13500560	13505560	as Nick claims, why would he not bring that up as a much more obvious example?
13505560	13508560	Well, it's because Zack wasn't there on Saturday.
13509560	13513560	Why would Nick appeal to Zack's ignorance rather than his knowledge?
13513560	13518560	Well, in my opinion, it's because Zack knows that she wasn't egging it on when he was there.
13518560	13523560	With this in mind, it doesn't surprise me that Zack snapped when hearing Nick's narrative.
13523560	13527560	Nick would make a couple more videos attacking Zack, and Zack responded.
13527560	13533560	Nick would concoct the narrative that he was, in fact, set up by both Stephanie and Zack due to a business partnership,
13533560	13536560	but that would mean that Zack would have needed to predict Nick dropping him in it
13536560	13541560	and leaking DMs without asking permission, and if Nick knew he was being dropped in it,
13541560	13543560	why would he appeal to Zack's authority?
13543560	13547560	To me, it seemed like he was trying to create hostility between Stephanie and Zack,
13547560	13550560	so that Zack would be forced to side with Nick, but when that failed,
13550560	13553560	he just changed the narrative so that Zack was actually in on it as well.
13553560	13557560	It's hard to see why else Nick would have asked Carly for permission, but not Zack.
13557560	13562560	I felt like what I was telling him, he was spoon feeding to Chicken Nugget,
13562560	13570560	that he was this, oh, I'm in the middle, but I'm in the middle, talking this way to me, talking this way to her,
13570560	13573560	and they are business partners, you guys.
13573560	13579560	They are joining up to make a lot of money, a lot of money.
13579560	13582560	Who knows how much? Tens of thousands of dollars.
13582560	13585560	They are business partners. They are going to come out with a product.
13585560	13590560	I don't know if they're still going to do it, but I'm telling you.
13590560	13595560	It still didn't really answer the other questions and just made Nick look like a bit of a conspiracy theorist.
13595560	13601560	The only thing in his favour was that Zack retained to lawyer, which to the commentator or critic would be a bit strange,
13601560	13604560	but Nick did have a terrible habit of twisting his words. For example,
13604560	13609560	Nick said that Zack couldn't have been a real friend because he didn't check on him when he landed after his flight.
13609560	13615560	Zack said he didn't DM either Nick or Stephanie after Stephanie's video, and Nick says this,
13616560	13620560	and show how you guys were so comfortable with me, yet you still hung out with me and drove me around
13620560	13624560	and tried to pull information out of me every chance you could get.
13624560	13628560	So how could you have stayed out of it totally and never texted again?
13628560	13634560	Which, again, is not believable, but yet we've heard from Chicken Nugget that the opposite happened,
13634560	13641560	that literally you were talking to her, you apologised, you gave permission to release more texts for her second video.
13641560	13644560	It's like, um, that's a lie.
13644560	13649560	It just reminds me of that guy who, when you ask why he wasn't early for the meeting, he says,
13649560	13652560	Well, I was here last week, which was very early.
13652560	13658560	If he was sharp, he would have observed that Stephanie shows a message from Zack she alleged to have sent on the day after her video.
13658560	13664560	This is a text message that Zack sent me on Sunday, December 22nd. This was the day after my video went up.
13664560	13669560	But unfortunately, I can't make being Nick's lawyer my full time job. Sorry, Nicholas.
13669560	13672560	I assume Zack retained a lawyer to avoid terminological hurdles,
13672560	13677560	but his lawyer probably told him what any person should have told him at that point, to stop biting.
13677560	13684560	However, not to be outdone, Nick uploads a video on January 23rd pretending to read a letter from Zack Choi's lawyer,
13684560	13686560	which was swiftly deleted following its upload.
13686560	13688560	You have been ordered to cease to sleep.
13688560	13695560	In the volume in the sauce, consumption of foods that you eat on a daily basis on your social media platforms
13696560	13701560	our client claims that you were negatively affecting the stretch marks on your behind and your pork belly.
13701560	13707560	Our client claims that your double chin should hence be forth censored and provided its own zip code.
13707560	13713560	Under threat of legal action, we demand that you cease and desist showing your pork belly and your eggplant on your social media platforms
13713560	13717560	as it is a direct offense to the morals of our client and the internet and beyond.
13717560	13720560	He made other responses to a couple people, but they soon fizzled out.
13720560	13724560	He says there's a lot people don't know, but it seems that people knew enough about him.
13724560	13728560	On the other hand, how was his melodramatic persona holding up?
13728560	13732560	Well, to be fair, it led to some sensational content.
13732560	13735560	You don't even know. You don't even know.
13735560	13738560	And this is my cinnamon stick.
13738560	13742560	And this is what's going to keep the evil spirits out, because I feel like there's evil spirits coming in, people casting spells on me.
13742560	13746560	Excuse me. Excuse you. Excuse me.
13746560	13753560	I am married to somebody who has a family who does witchcraft, so you better not watch out,
13753560	13755560	because I'm making sure there's no voodoo happening here.
13755560	13759560	I am blessing myself, clearing the energy out.
13759560	13761560	Out you go to the little out the door.
13761560	13765560	And guess what? That bad, bad energy can go right back to you.
13765560	13767560	Bye bye. You.
13767560	13769560	You don't even know what you're talking about.
13769560	13771560	I'm not sorry. Not sorry.
13771560	13774560	I'm not going to apologize for anything, for anyone, for any did in every way.
13774560	13777560	I don't even know what people are even wanting me to be sorry for.
13777560	13781560	To who? To who, Bill? To who? Sorry to who?
13783560	13788560	As shown earlier in one of his Veronica Wang videos, he said he just wanted to eat and cry on his channel.
13788560	13792560	This approach had separated his commentary persona from his melodramatic persona,
13792560	13797560	allowing the audience to lend him credibility in spite of his outlandish behaviour.
13797560	13802560	However, with his commentary credibility practically gone, he had no reason to preserve this border,
13802560	13807560	and it quickly devolved into various debauchery relating to the drama, and far beyond that.
13807560	13813560	But here's the kicker, when you think about it, it's the exact same cycle of his former vegan persona.
13813560	13819560	Establish yourself as a credible creator on a certain issue, whether that's your own lifestyle, behaviour, or someone else's.
13819560	13823560	Make multiple videos on each topic, being outspoken, opinionated, and convincing fans,
13823560	13827560	by channeling assurance and confidence, even if the evidence is shaky.
13827560	13831560	Eventually, this position no longer remains tenable, becoming quite apparent in the public eye,
13831560	13833560	either through your own narrative, or someone else's.
13833560	13839560	This is, in turn, met with a dramatised deterioration, which is absorbed into this ever-growing, more unhinged presence
13839560	13841560	which amplifies the drama.
13841560	13843560	Michelle Obama says pizza is a vegetable.
13843560	13845560	Michelle Obama says pizza is a vegetable.
13845560	13847560	Michelle Obama says pizza is a vegetable.
13847560	13849560	Turkey baster, up in here.
13849560	13851560	Turkey baster, up in here.
13851560	13853560	Turkey baster, up in here.
13853560	13855560	Why am I getting fat?
13855560	13857560	Why am I getting fat? I don't know why.
13857560	13859560	I eat all the food pyramids.
13859560	13861560	You think it's so funny, it's not funny.
13861560	13864560	I eat all the food groups.
13864560	13867560	I don't exclude any food groups.
13867560	13869560	I eat all the food groups.
13869560	13871560	I used to only eat two.
13871560	13877560	However, given the scale of this new drama, a lot of audiences just saw him swinging back and forth on his sentiments
13877560	13881560	and losing complete control of his channel, even though this was his brand,
13881560	13883560	and he was just cranking it all up to eleven.
13883560	13885560	The thumbnails, the titles, the topics,
13885560	13888560	it was hard to see why anyone would put themselves through that,
13888560	13893560	but Nick did, he would even make videos mimicking the comparison compilations,
13893560	13895560	asking what happened to him.
13895560	13899560	With his first video on his channel being about his departure from the vegan community,
13899560	13905560	many people would go back to this video and ask how he could come from such a calm, reasonable attitude to where he is today.
13905560	13909560	Well, there's one more twist to this tale, my friends.
13909560	13918560	With Nick's reputation finally being attacked from all angles,
13918560	13921560	it seemed inevitable that some old friends may resurface.
13921560	13925560	We already spoke about Star's Divine Munchies, who left a fresh input on the situation,
13925560	13929560	and a couple other more recent creators who had their run-ins with Mr Avocado.
13929560	13932560	These are not the stories that I find of particular interest,
13932560	13935560	in fact, there is one tale that may tell us more than anything else.
13935560	13938560	As you probably remember, though it's a while back now,
13938560	13940560	when responding to one of Veronica's videos,
13940560	13945560	Nick mainly chose to avoid a certain point relating to an email from someone by the name of Rainy Pachac.
13945560	13949560	This was the person who Nick had previously copyright-striked under an alias,
13949560	13952560	and attempted to conceal it for a while before coming clean,
13952560	13956560	but in Rainy's new video, he showed it went much deeper than just that.
13956560	13960560	Basically, I wanna say that Nick Ocado's been doing this to people for a very, very, very long time,
13960560	13965560	and a lot of people have been using my footage and other people's footage recently to prove that,
13965560	13967560	because these things are starting to surface,
13967560	13971560	and I think people, now that Nick Ocado's kinda been exposed a little bit,
13971560	13976560	people are feeling more comfortable about coming out and telling their stories about what he's done to them,
13976560	13979560	and so I think I am the first person, at least on YouTube,
13979560	13983560	that he has started this attacking pattern of his with.
13983560	13986560	He would eat like 19 avocados in a mukbang,
13986560	13989560	and he was in this community called the Low Fat Raw Vegan Community.
13989560	13992560	Low fat, high carb, that's what we eat, right?
13992560	13994560	And he's eating a ton of avocados,
13994560	13996560	so he had people being like,
13996560	13998560	yo bro, you should probably not eat so many avocados,
13998560	14001560	and being Nick, he takes everything super personally,
14001560	14002560	didn't like that one bit,
14002560	14005560	so he was at war with this community, right?
14005560	14008560	And so he was making drama videos about how he can eat high fat,
14008560	14010560	and it's fine, and blah blah blah,
14010560	14012560	and yeah, I agree, you can eat however you want.
14012560	14014560	That's not where our beef came from.
14014560	14018560	Our beef came from him using this drama on Facebook
14018560	14020560	to plug his YouTube channel.
14020560	14023560	I just felt like it was shady, it wasn't done with integrity,
14023560	14026560	but I came up to him in private message and said,
14026560	14030560	yo, inspect your integrity, you're making a lot of drama on Facebook
14030560	14033560	and using it to plug your YouTube channel to get more views.
14033560	14035560	I felt like I was friends enough with him
14035560	14037560	where I could give a little constructive criticism,
14037560	14039560	but no, I couldn't, that was a big mistake.
14039560	14041560	That really, really pissed him off.
14041560	14043560	Yes, and he comes with a fair few receipts of his own.
14043560	14047560	So in the coming days after that, I get a strike on my YouTube channel.
14047560	14052560	It says, Carlos Plaus put a strike on this video,
14052560	14054560	said that you used footage that was his.
14054560	14058560	It was actually a YouTube video where I did use somebody else's footage.
14058560	14060560	I didn't really know what I was doing back then.
14060560	14062560	I shouldn't have done it, but it wasn't Carlos Plaus.
14062560	14065560	It was not somebody named Carlos Plaus' footage.
14065560	14070560	So I look into Carlos Plaus, I find out that the only comments it's ever made,
14070560	14074560	the only channel it's had any engagement on is Nikocado's,
14074560	14075560	and the comments were ridiculous.
14075560	14077560	They were like, oh my God, you're so amazing.
14077560	14079560	You're like the coolest YouTuber ever.
14079560	14082560	And it became painfully obvious that it was a fake account
14082560	14086560	and Nik was using it to not only put a strike on my channel,
14086560	14089560	but to garner support, fake support on his own channel.
14089560	14093560	And so I asked him, hey Nik, this Carlos Plaus guy seems to like you a lot.
14093560	14096560	Will you ask him to, maybe because he's so much of your fan,
14096560	14099560	will you ask him maybe to please take this strike off my channel?
14099560	14101560	And he's like, yeah, sure, of course.
14101560	14103560	And he was like, oh, after like a week went by or something.
14103560	14105560	He's like, yeah, I tried. He didn't answer.
14105560	14108560	I have a whole video about this. You can watch the details about this.
14108560	14113560	But basically I say as a way to kind of get this copy strike off my back
14113560	14118560	and also kind of prove that it's Nik, I say, hey, it's okay.
14118560	14121560	I know how I can find out who it is. I'm a computer nerd. I'm a hacker.
14121560	14125560	I can find out his IP address as soon as I dispute the claim.
14126560	14130560	Ten minutes after I send that to Nik, the claim is taken off my YouTube account.
14130560	14132560	Obviously, Nik, who did it?
14132560	14134560	Nik and Orlin are totally ridiculous.
14134560	14136560	They keep asking me to do things for them.
14136560	14139560	Eventually I'm like, okay, no, you put a strike on my channel.
14139560	14141560	I'm not doing anything for you.
14141560	14144560	Maybe in the future if you apologize and Nik's really nice to me for a while,
14144560	14146560	I'll start being friends with you guys again.
14146560	14151560	So Nik doesn't say anything until I think the 2015 Woodstock Fruit Festival
14151560	14155560	where he comes up to me on the first day, says yeah.
14155560	14159560	He admits that it was me, that it was him. He apologizes.
14159560	14163560	And he tells me that he did it because two reasons.
14163560	14166560	One of them I will not mention because I feel like it's too personal.
14166560	14170560	But one of the reasons is because he was jealous of my camera equipment
14170560	14173560	and my YouTube channel and my skills and blah, blah, blah.
14173560	14175560	So that kind of says a little bit of something.
14175560	14178560	His whole relationship with me, all he talked about was my video equipment,
14178560	14180560	my stuff, my blah, blah, blah.
14180560	14183560	And he was upset, obviously. I think this is something he does.
14183560	14186560	He gets upset by something and then attacks, and this is his pattern.
14186560	14190560	Ultimately, what can be alleged from this video is that Nik's rather toxic attitude
14190560	14193560	predated his withdrawal from the vegan community,
14193560	14198560	and that ultimately after making a series of attacks against people in the raw vegan community,
14198560	14202560	he subsequently departed, attacking many others, including Rainey himself.
14202560	14205560	Here's why, after nine videos of praise,
14205560	14209560	he makes three videos trying to destroy the Woodstock Fruit Festival.
14209560	14211560	He started eating cooked food,
14211560	14215560	and some people within the community had some stuff to say about that.
14215560	14217560	Stupid stuff to say, I will admit.
14217560	14219560	They said things like, oh, he's lost his way.
14219560	14222560	Oh, he's fallen off the path, fallen off the wagon.
14222560	14225560	He's returned to eating toxic food.
14225560	14229560	He makes many videos about how raw food is bad, an eating disorder,
14229560	14231560	and how raw vegans are insane,
14231560	14235560	and how the Woodstock Fruit Festival, the largest fruit festival in the world,
14235560	14239560	is a freaking insane place where they starve their volunteers,
14239560	14241560	and they pull coconuts out of the trash,
14241560	14243560	and make food out of them,
14243560	14246560	and feed them to the people who are paying way too much money,
14246560	14248560	and they wouldn't let him have a wedding there,
14248560	14251560	and he insinuated it was because he was gay,
14251560	14253560	and all this stuff because he got offended.
14253560	14256560	He's now trying to destroy, destroy, destroy.
14256560	14258560	This is his pattern. This is what he does.
14258560	14260560	I work with the Woodstock Fruit Festival.
14260560	14264560	I'm their videographer, and so I'm making a video to defend them.
14264560	14267560	I'm working with them to defend them, and here's where I mess up.
14267560	14271560	I make the mistake of talking on Facebook about making this video.
14271560	14273560	I say, hey, I'm going to make this video.
14273560	14276560	I'm going to work with a doctor to prove that he's lying about the herpes thing.
14276560	14277560	That's not what I should have done.
14277560	14280560	I should have kept it private and just come out with the video.
14280560	14283560	All of this would have been very different had I done that,
14283560	14287560	but no, I had to let people know that I was making the video, so it alerted Nick,
14287560	14293560	so what he did was made a 40-minute long video to try to get people to distrust me.
14293560	14295560	It's like war with this kid.
14295560	14300560	Like, if you slip up a little bit, he's going to take advantage of that to the fullest,
14300560	14305560	to try to destroy you, to ruin your reputation, to get people to not trust you,
14305560	14309560	and I think this is the first time he did it, unless he was doing this in high school too. Who knows?
14309560	14313560	Rainy links an old response he wrote to the video, which Nick had uploaded,
14313560	14318560	and also shows emails in which Nick had attempted to convince Rainy to remove his side of the drama.
14318560	14322560	Rainy made the logical assumption that this sudden change was due to Nick coming under fire
14322560	14326560	from other vegan commentators like The Vegan Cheater and Martin Lewis.
14326560	14329560	Interestingly, Martin had spoken about his own experience with Nick
14329560	14331560	in an older video with receipts of his own.
14331560	14334560	With my accounts. Now, I have a few other fake accounts,
14334560	14337560	where they're run by me, but it's not really me.
14337560	14339560	They have like no photos, or it's like a random photo.
14339560	14341560	Some of them have friends, some of them don't.
14341560	14346560	It's a technique that I actually learned from them, which is ironic,
14346560	14350560	to have other accounts to help you along, start controversy,
14350560	14354560	you know, make fun of yourself, have your fans or followers defend you.
14354560	14358560	It stirs things up. Start controversy, start controversy, start controversy.
14358560	14363560	Here you have Nicholas posting on Facebook, trying to fool everyone,
14363560	14368560	and make out that I have a fake account, when in actual reality,
14368560	14375560	he's the one who creates fake accounts to start shitting people so he can get more publicity.
14375560	14379560	He tried to damage my reputation by saying I had a fake account, when I never did.
14379560	14388560	He's done like sneaky, snakey-ish, deliberately said things to make it look like I had a fake account,
14388560	14393560	when I never ever told him that I had a fake account, because I didn't.
14393560	14397560	In range description, there are links to various uploads that have withstood the test of time,
14397560	14400560	including one of Nick's about the Woodstock Food Festival.
14400560	14404560	And oh boy, a lot may have changed, but Nick hasn't.
14404560	14408560	Obviously, the festival's struggling, and I want to draw in people by making videos.
14408560	14410560	My videos have gotten tens of thousands of views.
14410560	14413560	It's gotten more views than the official Woodstock promo video.
14413560	14416560	There are people from my gym, people that follow me on YouTube,
14416560	14418560	that said, I'm going to come to the festival because of these videos.
14418560	14421560	This looks like amazing. It was basically a promotion show for them.
14421560	14426560	Because I did have a good time, and I was happy to be there as Mike Vosity's assistant,
14426560	14429560	but at the same time, that doesn't mean I didn't see all the shit that went on.
14429560	14432560	And like, I feel like people deserve to know the truth.
14432560	14441560	The Woodstock chef ordered Orlin and other people to go digging through the garbage cans to find coconuts
14441560	14444560	that they were just going to blend up and turn into a cake.
14444560	14449560	Their cake was made from the trash, and it wasn't until that festival ended
14449560	14453560	that Orlin now has what we call hoppers, because they hop from place to place.
14453560	14455560	He has herpes in his mouth. He's never had herpes.
14455560	14458560	And a lot of you are going to be like, oh, well, that's common, that's this and that.
14458560	14461560	It's like, no, this is malpractice. They could get sued for this.
14461560	14463560	They're feeding people shit from the trash.
14463560	14466560	There's been a lot of talk about what happened to Nick.
14466560	14470560	But to be honest, not much happened. He merely adapted to new communities.
14470560	14473560	Claiming the communities changed him, claiming the lifestyle changed him,
14473560	14476560	claiming the food changed him would simply be false.
14476560	14479560	I'm not entirely sure why he approaches these things the way he does.
14479560	14483560	Maybe it's for the fanatical followers. They've certainly been a permanent fixture.
14483560	14484560	You should be careful.
14484560	14488560	Nick Ocado is one of the most powerful mukbangers, and he could press charges.
14488560	14492560	You need to grow up and say you're sorry before something bad happens to you.
14492560	14495560	With these conflicts, a cycle appears to arise.
14495560	14499560	He was part of something, he left it, he attacked it, and then he moved on.
14499560	14502560	He did that with the raw vegan community, he did that with the vegan community,
14502560	14505560	and eventually he went on to do that with other YouTubers.
14505560	14509560	That's not an option with his current brand, because he's transcended a community
14509560	14512560	and emerged as an individual, put his reputation on the line,
14512560	14514560	and that will probably follow him into any community.
14514560	14516560	It's not something that he can just up and leave,
14516560	14520560	which is probably why he's taken a slightly different approach to this drama.
14524560	14526560	Another creator who briefly dropped in to leave her thoughts
14526560	14529560	was one of Nick's earliest friends and collaborators, Brianna Jackson.
14529560	14532560	She's also a former vegan, however, when Nick left the community,
14532560	14535560	she made a video responding to this decision.
14535560	14539560	A lot of comments insinuating that I'm a hypocrite, you know,
14539560	14542560	because I've come out and I'm no longer vegan anymore,
14542560	14548560	when three years ago I made a video about Nikocado Avocado not being vegan anymore.
14548560	14553560	So there's some things I have to say on this, some things to get off my chest.
14553560	14557560	In her new video, she responds to people asking her to apologise to Nick
14557560	14560560	as she subsequently made the decision to leave veganism behind as well,
14560560	14563560	while sharing some voice memos of her own.
14563560	14568560	Because people are acting like they know everything about the situation,
14568560	14573560	as if they know all about our friendship, all about me, all about Nick and what happened,
14573560	14578560	and they've just made this decision that I'm the one that must apologise, you know?
14578560	14584560	And for anyone that doesn't know, Nick is not just some random person that I made a video about,
14584560	14585560	we were friends.
14585560	14590560	I went travelling with him for three months during summer 2016.
14590560	14594560	We went to Thailand, we went to Bali, we did everything together.
14594560	14599560	We shared a bed, we shared food, we literally spent the whole day together.
14599560	14602560	There weren't many times that we were apart.
14602560	14607560	So a lot happened between us, a lot of things that you guys don't know.
14607560	14612560	And leaving a comment like that, you're assuming you know everything about the friendship,
14612560	14615560	and acting like you're the one that needs to apologise,
14615560	14619560	when you don't know anything about our friendship, you don't know what happened,
14619560	14624560	you don't know the shit that he did to me, and why our friendship broke up.
14624560	14628560	And yes, in that video, I was acting like we were still friends,
14628560	14632560	because I wasn't ready to tell you guys that we weren't friends on that video.
14632560	14638560	That video was about promoting veganism, and I didn't want to come across as this crazy person who hated him.
14638560	14640560	But yes, I did hate him at the time.
14640560	14643560	Do I hate him now? No.
14643560	14646560	But will I ever forgive him for what he did to me? No.
14646560	14649560	And will I apologise to him? Hell fucking no.
14649560	14655560	You're not going to know the full story, but you're going to hear some of the shit that he said to me.
14655560	14660560	You don't realise how you come across to people.
14660560	14663560	You look like a miserable, wet dog.
14663560	14665560	Even Ellie said she's always asking you.
14665560	14669560	And you have this disgusting scowl on your face all the time when we're going to restaurants.
14669560	14675560	Look, Brianna, if you're antisocial, and you're so fucking out of it sometimes,
14675560	14679560	you didn't even see the camera in the kitchen recording me asking you questions.
14679560	14681560	You didn't see any of it.
14681560	14687560	I have dozens of videos of you treating me like shit, ignoring me, giving me smartass responses.
14687560	14693560	The convo of you asking me why, the convo of me asking why you lied about the collab video.
14693560	14697560	The parts of the mukbangs reacted like a negative bump in the log. I have all of it.
14697560	14700560	You acted like an entitled brat.
14700560	14704560	So, I have the screenshots. I have Ellie's phone call recorded.
14704560	14707560	You have made both of us uncomfortable.
14707560	14710560	Once again, it has this highly accusatory undertone,
14710560	14713560	and although there is strictly one side to this story on show here,
14713560	14715560	and she said she doesn't really have too much else to add,
14715560	14721560	Rainey also shared DMs where Brianna stated that she had previously received a completely different impression
14721560	14725560	to the one presented by Nick, with the other DMs we've seen, some of which presented by Nick himself,
14725560	14728560	seem to maintain the theme that he has a habit of poisoning the well.
14728560	14731560	When it comes to other creators, that's obviously a more personal issue.
14731560	14734560	When paired with the other observed actions,
14734560	14738560	it seems like an excellent alienation tactic if those people were ever exposed.
14738560	14742560	After all, the mukbang king shall banquish whom he wishes.
14742560	14748560	For the record, the girl that he mentioned in those voice notes who apparently hated me, Ellie,
14748560	14752560	she's still one of my best friends. I just saw her in November in Florida.
14752560	14761560	We are very good. So yeah, he did a lot of shit to me that showed me that I would never, ever trust him again.
14761560	14764560	All of these individuals are aware of the flaws within the community,
14764560	14769560	and outwardly state that there are those who are toxic, who have probably helped precipitate the situation themselves.
14769560	14772560	As noted, such lifestyles can breed fanaticism.
14772560	14778560	However, it seems that Nikocado thrived on these sentiments as much as many of his quote haters.
14778560	14783560	People fighting, people making videos about who texted who, who cheated on who, who said what,
14783560	14786560	taking screenshots of comments from months ago and making dramatic videos about it.
14786560	14791560	Like, if that is evident with just a few thousand people in the world who have gone vegan,
14791560	14794560	then if the whole world is vegan, we are not saved.
14794560	14798560	When Nikocado made that video announcing his departure, he may have seemed reasonable.
14798560	14802560	He may have been looking for a fresh start, but the subsequent devolution of his behaviour
14802560	14807560	and the consequences that ensued wasn't a new development, it was a return to old habits.
14807560	14813560	And old habits die hard. But was Nik about to try and cull them? Let's find out.
14819560	14823560	Nik didn't really have much commentary credibility to salvage at this point.
14823560	14827560	Throughout January 2020, he had done nothing but aggravate the situation,
14827560	14831560	and by the time February came around, it didn't look like he was going to make it any easier for himself.
14831560	14836560	This is Hushbang, the uploaded content that was similar to a lot of Mukbang compilation channels.
14836560	14841560	Now, as I understand, they had uploaded multiple videos covering Nikocado Avocado's drama.
14841560	14846560	It seemed Nik wasn't happy about this, and decided to send multiple copyright strikes to this channel.
14846560	14852560	Hushbang subsequently privated all these videos and made a community post stating that they would be explaining
14852560	14857560	why soon. Nik then replied sardonically, commenting on the post that he's looking forward to it.
14857560	14862560	Many of Nik's strongest critics quickly jumped onto this, observing the hypocrisy given the narratives
14862560	14864560	he espoused in his Veronica Wang uploads.
14865560	14871560	Folks, Nikocado isn't in the wrong. He can copyright strike any channel he wants, like ever.
14871560	14877560	He has the right to even strike CNN if he wants, because Nikocado Avocado can do whatever he wants.
14877560	14883560	One of these critics was Veronica Wang herself, who expressed anger at the abandonment of such principles,
14883560	14887560	given how he'd mobilised them so assertively against her. A few days later,
14887560	14890560	Nik would go on drama alert to be interviewed by Keemstar and Leafy.
14890560	14894560	Nik maintained his position and responded to some of Keemstar's quite reasonable observations,
14894560	14897560	by making statements which I feel weren't entirely honest.
14898560	14900560	100%. 100%.
14901560	14907560	But, but Stephanie could also say, I only included that so you could better understand why I felt the way I did, right?
14907560	14910560	So there's always two sides to every story, but...
14910560	14917560	That's pretty extreme. I've never done that to someone where I pull out like that type of seriousness
14917560	14921560	to, you know, say, oh, I felt a certain way. I mean, that's just going to the extreme.
14921560	14926560	That's really, that means that you need more to add to the argument to make it a video.
14926560	14930560	Then Leafy joins, and well, what did you think was going to happen?
14930560	14933560	I don't have the energy. It's because I'm sick.
14933560	14936560	But I'm your number one fan.
14936560	14939560	You're my number one fan? What?
14939560	14943560	It's really helped me get through tough times and whatnot.
14943560	14947560	I don't believe you. I'm sorry. I don't believe you. I mean, no offense, but there's no way you are.
14947560	14949560	I am being 100% honest.
14949560	14951560	Leafy, why do you like it?
14951560	14953560	I'm in a doctor's bed right now.
14953560	14957560	He also said this regarding a prospective apology for his alleged misdeeds.
14957560	14960560	If I am going through stuff and I'm going to express it, or if I'm not sorry,
14960560	14964560	or people want me to be sorry for something I didn't even fucking do,
14964560	14967560	how is that genuine or good YouTube content? I don't understand.
14967560	14972560	However, a few days later, he uploaded a one and a half hour long video called I'm Sorry.
14972560	14975560	Though not apologizing for any specific drama that instigated his reaction,
14975560	14978560	he does apologize for some of his subsequent behaviour,
14978560	14981560	while also explaining why he behaved in a certain way.
14981560	14986560	He also discusses some changes in his life that he's been making to hopefully help him improve.
14986560	14995560	I have messed up a lot over the past six months.
14995560	14998560	I have messed up my whole life, actually. Let's take that back.
14998560	15000560	My whole life has been bad.
15000560	15008560	This past week or two especially has been I just need to apologize for everything.
15008560	15013560	I just am embarrassed.
15013560	15018560	This is not a good apology. That's also why I've been afraid to say something.
15018560	15021560	Because it's also excuses.
15021560	15028560	I mean, I am sorry that I'm telling you that I'm not happy with how I behave on the internet sometimes.
15028560	15032560	But I'm also, I feel like I need to tell you why and give you my perspective,
15032560	15034560	but then it comes across as an excuse.
15034560	15038560	But then if I don't tell you, then you think I'm just fully off the rock or deranged.
15038560	15042560	I'm not, but I don't know.
15042560	15053560	I don't know what I need to say to make people feel better other than I'm sorry.
15053560	15054560	I'm very sorry.
15054560	15058560	Knowing that everyone thinks I'm the victim, not the victim, the villain,
15058560	15062560	and then me saying, well, if I'm the villain, let me be the villain.
15062560	15067560	I have no problem. I know who I am. I have no problem doing something.
15067560	15071560	You know, it's like, it's all of those things combined.
15071560	15074560	Like, I'm mentally not well. I'm physically not well.
15074560	15077560	I'm frying my brain. My relationship isn't good.
15077560	15082560	I'm naturally extra and emotional, but I also have a lot of flaws to who I am.
15082560	15083560	And I've made some mistakes.
15083560	15087560	And then I've also exaggerated stuff because I know I've got a reaction.
15087560	15091560	But YouTube, you know, it spreads my channel when people make more videos about me.
15091560	15095560	And it's like, it goes even further. It's kind of a mess.
15095560	15100560	I went to therapy today. Wow.
15100560	15104560	First of all, I'm very lucky to have a therapist on Sundays.
15104560	15109560	Second of all, I'm lucky to have such a grounded, smart person.
15109560	15113560	I talked about it in yesterday's video, my third channel, how it's just like people.
15113560	15118560	I didn't think I needed it. I always said I'm very analytical and thought provoking.
15118560	15122560	And I like to, even though I don't appear that way on YouTube, that's also my character.
15122560	15128560	I just, I'm very analytical and stuff, but I never, I took me by surprise.
15128560	15135560	The fact that there's someone else that could be offering you insight to things that you would have thought of initially.
15135560	15139560	And you're not as smart as yourself. And sometimes you have to hear it from someone else.
15139560	15147560	So I'm addressing medication. I'm addressing, which again, I don't know if you're going to notice any differences in my mukbangs going forward.
15147560	15153560	You know, all medicines have side effects and stuff, and I don't want people, I don't want that.
15153560	15159560	I just kinda, I want you to know that I have various people in my life helping me,
15159560	15165560	and I have various tools in my life to help me fix all the things that are going on.
15165560	15169560	These accounts made sense to some people, however others weren't quite as convinced,
15169560	15175560	not believing his rationale stood under scrutiny, such as his reasoning regarding the Kobe Bryant escapades.
15175560	15182560	I, right hand, I know it's my left hand, right hand up to God.
15182560	15190560	I did not know who he was. Never heard of him in my life. You name any sport player, I'm not going to know a thing about them.
15190560	15198560	I just don't know. And that was the first time I heard of him. And Kobe, spelled that way, was the first, it's not a common name.
15198560	15205560	I never, it wasn't something, I can barely even remember, it's someone I meet five times.
15205560	15209560	After admitting that a lot of this content is made for the purpose of trolling,
15209560	15214560	it would be a strange decision to try and downplay other incidents, although it's hard to really buy his explanation
15214560	15217560	when he addresses Bryant by such ridiculous substitutes.
15217560	15225560	No, it feels like four letters, K, baby beep. Calvin? Oh, what was his name?
15225560	15232560	It starts with a K, even though it sounds like it should be a C. Kenneth? I don't know, I don't think it's that long.
15232560	15237560	I remember being very short, like four letters, I think there's an O in there.
15237560	15244560	Kirk, Kirk, Kathy. Oh, everyone's really upset, everyone's shouting at the screen.
15244560	15249560	I don't know sports, I don't know basketball, I don't, I've never heard of them before, don't come for me.
15249560	15251560	I don't know sports or anything.
15251560	15255560	Other people doubted the intent of this video, which after everything that's been revealed,
15255560	15258560	and the following publicity stunts, is understandable.
15258560	15262560	Ultimately, that part will come down to personal interpretation of his remarks.
15262560	15266560	One issue he did not appear remorseful over was that regarding Hushbang,
15266560	15270560	which he appeared to stand his ground on, stating that he'd be discussing it soon.
15270560	15278560	I also don't want to respond to that, because I just had a meeting with my manager from Google,
15278560	15282560	and we're looking into it, so that's all I'm saying.
15282560	15290560	It was not false, and we are pursuing what we need to, that's that.
15290560	15296560	That's all I'm going to say at this point, but it was made on the decision of a few people.
15296560	15301560	However, his next video turned out to be another apology video, this time to Veronica Wang,
15301560	15304560	which integrated the Hushbang discussion.
15305560	15308560	There's a lot more to that story.
15308560	15311560	What I'm able to talk about, because nothing has been confirmed yet,
15311560	15314560	I have been speaking with the copyright team here on YouTube.
15314560	15318560	I have been speaking with my manager at Google.
15318560	15323560	We, or them, are evaluating it and escalating it.
15323560	15325560	I have connections at YouTube, okay?
15325560	15334560	I use them when I feel like I'm being targeted, and I guess I felt very targeted, and that's the truth.
15334560	15344560	It's one thing where people react to me, or make comments about me, or criticize me, or say,
15344560	15349560	oh, he's crazy, he's stupid, he's ...
15349560	15358560	It's another thing when, out of over 100 videos on a channel, 80 of them were only about me,
15358560	15360560	and I felt very targeted.
15360560	15365560	Would those videos have been made if I didn't give people a reason to talk about me?
15365560	15372560	No, so it's kind of like I'm eating my own pudding, I'm getting a taste of my own medicine,
15372560	15374560	because what did I do to Veronica?
15374560	15381560	So you add up all those videos, plus the video I made a week ago, that's a collection of videos.
15381560	15383560	I can't imagine what she's feeling too.
15383560	15393560	Why should I be able to feel badly, or hurt, or target, or hurt, or anything like that about a situation,
15393560	15396560	but she's not allowed to with me?
15396560	15399560	People seem to feel this was a more sincere apology.
15399560	15405560	He once again talks a lot about his mentality, and how that yielded his behaviour, which he now sees the error in.
15405560	15407560	Very Admiral Reflection, for sure.
15407560	15413560	However, the cynical side of me can't help but feel that this sympathy towards Veronica Wang is a way to validate
15413560	15416560	the position he has taken, while appearing selfless.
15416560	15421560	Now, changing your stance with new experience and information is fine, but mass copyright strikes seem like
15421560	15427560	such a weird thing to 180 on, and I'll never truly agree or provide sympathy for people who do that stuff
15427560	15429560	unless it's just literal re-uploads.
15429560	15435560	Mass strikes at once always feel like a calculated effort to attack a channel, rather than actually defending
15435560	15440560	the content, because there are so many other ways around it, it always feels personal.
15440560	15444560	With that said, the video is an hour long, and he talks about a lot, and I don't want to present the perception
15444560	15449560	that it's just that, and since then Hushbang have moved on from that content and gone back to doing what
15449560	15452560	they did prior, which was being a Sims channel. Good for them.
15452560	15457560	As I understand, they were actually saved by YouTube's intervention, though I'm not sure how much of a hand
15457560	15458560	Nick had in that.
15458560	15463560	With these videos, it did seem that Nick Ocado was attempting to turn over a new leak.
15463560	15468560	He advocated the distinction of his trolling persona, and it's clear he didn't want to just be remembered
15468560	15472560	as a troll, but did want to sustain that side of him for entertainment purposes.
15473560	15481560	I really want to just grow from this, and also let you know that there's also things that I do on purpose,
15481560	15486560	I mean, because it's the internet, and I like to have fun.
15486560	15490560	To many people, life is about a legacy, how one will be remembered after they're gone,
15490560	15495560	whether that's internet presence or existence in general, and when facing down his legacy,
15495560	15500560	Nick reacted in the way that he knew best, but now the joke was over, he still had content to create.
15500560	15504560	and wanted to be more than a YouTube villain. Will he ever have that opportunity?
15504560	15507560	And what can be said about this exhausting character?
15512560	15516560	Nicholas, Nicholas, Nicholas, what to do with you?
15516560	15521560	Let's start this part with a positive. Nick likes cheese, I really like cheese as well,
15521560	15524560	cheese is great, good on you for liking cheese.
15524560	15527560	When South Korea gave the world Mukbang all those years ago,
15527560	15531560	few could have foreseen that it would create so many waves across many people's lives.
15531560	15535560	In many ways, with consumerism considered, it shouldn't be that surprising,
15535560	15540560	but there is a level of awe that I still find myself in that such a conceptually innocent idea
15540560	15542560	has distorted itself into this.
15542560	15547560	Nikocado was one of the first on the gravy train, making Mukbangs before he'd even quit veganism.
15547560	15551560	In a way, I think Nick's Mukbangs suit him in a twisted fashion.
15551560	15555560	There is something so fascinating yet so empty about its presentation.
15555560	15559560	Nick hailed from fervent communities with people who were very strong willed,
15559560	15565560	but Nick was equally as strong willed, and he eventually lost the allegiance to said community,
15565560	15570560	channeling his passion down other avenues, and often against the communities he had previously identified with.
15570560	15576560	Although he had pledged to distance himself from the drama, he gradually began to dabble more and more.
15576560	15580560	After all of that toxic drama, he couldn't resist. Why is that?
15580560	15585560	It's an element of me trolling for the camera because it gets people talking.
15585560	15588560	The more people talk about me, the more I grow.
15588560	15592560	Whether they're negative videos or not, it pushes my name in the algorithm.
15592560	15595560	Nikocado Avocado, my channel just keeps getting bigger and bigger.
15595560	15600560	Even if people are leaving, it's like they're coming back or they're being brought in from other people who don't know me yet.
15600560	15606560	I think this quote is more important than one may initially consider it, although only partly true.
15606560	15609560	I'm sure there are many reasons for why he behaves the way he does,
15609560	15615560	but I think his main motive is to provoke. His rather aberrant content doesn't tend to attract more views,
15615560	15622560	and never has really, it tends to alienate some audience members, and overall only loosely fits in thematically with his other content,
15622560	15625560	often being a product of some other incident that spirals.
15625560	15631560	Therefore, it was inevitable when everything began to spiral, so did the prevalence of this character.
15631560	15635560	Nick has been doing this from the start, it's a pattern, he initiates an argument, picks a strong position,
15635560	15638560	because people love strong positions, and he runs with it for better and for worse,
15638560	15642560	and if it goes south, he just hits the fuck it button and loses all control.
15642560	15661560	Oh my god.
15661560	15666560	It hurts so bad. How dare you call me dramatic? Really? You people make me fucking sick.
15666560	15670560	Get the fuck out of here. How dare you call me dramatic?
15670560	15677560	Oh, yeah, what did she say? Come on. Oh, first of all, let's just bring him back. Oh, he's trying to be a little...
15677560	15683560	It's entertaining, even if it makes him look like a fool, and he can make himself look like a fool because it's his reputation.
15683560	15689560	In a way, it was a win-win, because if he's taken seriously and lent credibility, then he can make more videos capitalising on that,
15689560	15693560	and if he's not taken seriously, then he can just turn it into a massive meme.
15693560	15697560	It ultimately means that it's difficult to decipher what's real and what's not in his life.
15697560	15703560	Nick claims that he lets his mood lead his content, given the daily upload schedule, and because his mood is so volatile,
15703560	15708560	you'd never know what to exactly expect, and with videos every day at an exhaustive rate,
15708560	15714560	his persona just amalgamates into a blur. He's never dull, but by allowing so many sides to consume him,
15714560	15717560	it feels like a simulation and not a real person.
15717560	15721560	I think the motive to provoke and entertain is something that pervades all this content,
15721560	15725560	and I don't doubt that it was part of his motivation when making call-out videos too.
15725560	15729560	Calling others out can be pretty exciting for creators and audiences alike,
15729560	15734560	and there's some real feeling of righteousness that it can drive, but there is a cost for making them.
15734560	15738560	Whether it's viewed by the instigator or the recipient, you're going at someone's reputation,
15738560	15742560	and as Nick observes himself, that will have a lasting effect on a brand.
15742560	15746560	Exposed culture is like that, and when the momentum was in his favour, Nick went with it.
15746560	15753560	He set a target, he set a position, and he entertained many people who wanted to see someone problematic brought down.
15753560	15758560	Nick had this fascinating approach to framing these people to be exposed as these manipulative masterminds,
15758560	15762560	pulling the strings, when many of them were almost completely the opposite to me.
15762560	15766560	Creators panic responding to criticism, some of which very warranted,
15766560	15770560	but them clearly having no clue what to do because they've never been involved in this.
15770560	15773560	A lot of creators don't respond well to strongly formed criticism.
15773560	15777560	Nick targeted them and gained credibility off the back of their incompetence.
15777560	15782560	Nevertheless, the content itself was opportunistic and provided an illusion of argumentative soundness,
15782560	15786560	because his demeanor conveyed conviction, his responses appeared comprehensive,
15786560	15789560	and his targets had often already been written off by audiences.
15789560	15793560	With these other personas balanced, that was a perilous position to be in.
15793560	15797560	It was only a matter of time until his narratives were placed under similar scrutiny,
15797560	15799560	and the cracks were going to appear.
15799560	15804560	What was truly exceptional is the nature by which it happened, an exposed video by someone who he planned to expose,
15804560	15810560	a video which showcased his behaviour as aggressive, manipulative, and just all-round unpleasant,
15810560	15812560	likely with the aim of cornering his subjects.
15812560	15815560	Nick wonders why this couldn't have been solved by a DM.
15815560	15819560	I'm sorry I reacted poorly to her standing me up.
15819560	15822560	I shouldn't have messaged and called that many times,
15822560	15824560	but I wanted to feel a little bit better.
15824560	15828560	If she was afraid of our developing friendship, as she said in her text,
15828560	15832560	for the sake of her developing friendship, I'm like, well, if you're trying to develop a friendship,
15832560	15834560	you can say, hey, Nick, this is what's really up.
15834560	15837560	I want to voice it to you, not, you know, keep you wondering.
15838560	15842560	You know what I mean? It really wasn't that big of an issue,
15842560	15846560	but now it's been blown up into this whole thing across the whole internet,
15846560	15851560	and I'm going to lose money, I'm going to lose business, I'm going to lose support, I'm going to lose trust.
15851560	15855560	And a couple years ago, they may have been able to talk it out before it reached a video stage,
15855560	15860560	but there was no confrontation by either party, even though there was demonstrable hostility.
15860560	15864560	Nick's own commitment to the culture and the focus that he dedicated to exposing people
15864560	15869560	led to such a rapid disintegration of trust that there was no private resolution,
15869560	15873560	particularly given Nick's public flogging of the drama before this video,
15873560	15878560	and in the end, Nick exposed himself as a rather callous snake who was pursuing a friendship for the sake of tea,
15878560	15881560	citing his own trash talk as evidence.
15881560	15884560	He may not have done anything egregiously awful, I agree there,
15884560	15887560	but the bar was lowered, partly through his own exposes.
15887560	15893560	Speaking for myself, but I'd take Nick's experience with Trisha Paytas any day over Stephanie's experience with Nick.
15893560	15898560	Also, there is an element of my attachment disorder showing through.
15898560	15902560	I didn't want to accept that, I couldn't say, oh, whatever.
15902560	15907560	I was like, no, I need to know why, what did I do, I need to be liked, I need to be accepted.
15907560	15911560	So that is where some of that played into as well.
15911560	15922560	I'm 26, 27 years old, I need to just say, okay, I was overtaken with not accepting rejection
15922560	15929560	or no or feeling left, and it's not because I'm a predator, it's not because I have sexual tendencies,
15929560	15935560	it's not because I'm a master manipulator trying to convince everyone of something,
15935560	15942560	it's because I don't like being ghosted and I take it a lot harder than other people for various different reasons.
15942560	15951560	And I'm sorry for that because I can't understand how that would trigger whatever she went through with whoever she went through.
15951560	15955560	And this wasn't six hours without eating, this was after sleeping for nine hours.
15955560	15959560	And I saw people on Twitter saying, oh gosh, poor baby, he has to not eat for five hours.
15959560	15964560	It was five hours of waiting, but I hadn't eaten since the night before when we filmed her collab,
15964560	15966560	which was like, I don't know, 10pm.
15966560	15972560	So that's 12 hours plus 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 hours without food.
15972560	15975560	The sad thing is that towards the end of his response to Stephanie Sue,
15975560	15979560	Nick does begin to speak somewhat remorsefully about mistakes he made.
15979560	15984560	And although I question certain elements of his argument, such as the point about mukbangers starving themselves,
15984560	15987560	like the dude literally had three full meals the day before,
15987560	15992560	I wish he had made this a more central element rather than what felt like a footnote.
15992560	15997560	It feels he struggles with two sides of him because one moment he talks about his attachment disorder
15997560	15999560	and why that makes him act more irrationally than most,
15999560	16003560	and the next minute he says that most people would have reacted the way he did.
16004560	16015560	I'm very, very, very sorry for making her feel like getting flashbacks to when someone convinced her not to say no,
16015560	16019560	or someone pressured her into doing sexual activities.
16019560	16026560	I'm sorry that I sprung, I instigated, I ignited those feelings and memories.
16026560	16031560	I'm sorry, I had no idea, I had no way of knowing, she didn't tell me.
16031560	16037560	And I was pissed, and I also have a problem being rejected.
16037560	16043560	Why do you think I make all these videos searching for acceptance on the computer?
16043560	16045560	I feel 100% justified in that reaction.
16045560	16049560	I think most people would have reacted that way if they were left hanging for seven hours.
16049560	16054560	I feel like people do want to get to know Nick, but no one really knows who he is.
16054560	16059560	If he'd been more inclined to integrate apologetic elements, then it would have made him more human.
16059560	16065560	But instead, he enshrined himself as the villain, and set himself up to be clinically taken apart because of details
16065560	16067560	which he was lucidly dishonest about.
16067560	16072560	Eventually, this led him to self-destruct mode, and took him down a road of performative insanity,
16072560	16078560	which combined with fresh negative attention by critical audiences, cultivated a whole new reputation in itself,
16078560	16082560	a reputation that Nick initially embraced before realising it was not sustainable,
16082560	16085560	and attempting to patch up some wounds to compensate for his erratic behaviour.
16085560	16088560	Since then, it seems he's been trying to separate the personas a little,
16088560	16093560	saving most of his eccentric content for Nikocado Avocado 3, and more Nikocado,
16093560	16098560	and uploading a few more serious videos on his main channel, though its content can be a little questionable.
16098560	16117560	But there is one thing for certain, it is undeniably Nikocado,
16117560	16122560	and over these last few months, he has continued to evolve his persona to the changing landscape.
16122560	16124560	Let's conclude this then.
16130560	16133560	I'm sure you people have heard a lot about OnlyFans recently,
16133560	16139560	the website where some creators decide to post rather candid content in return for monetary support.
16139560	16145560	Well, Nick's a guy who likes to put himself online, and his OnlyFans account takes that mantra to the next level.
16145560	16153560	He uploads and advertises it on a fairly regular basis, while proudly boasting that his page is in the top 0.25% of creators on the website.
16153560	16157560	Congratulations to you, Nick. Unfortunately, I did not subscribe.
16157560	16162560	There's a lot of business on such a website as people aren't really too concerned with your commentary credibility,
16162560	16166560	they just want the goods. With this, you could say that Nick has been moving forward,
16166560	16172560	but a lot of the stigma has persisted, with him being called out for any actions which could be classed as problematic.
16172560	16177560	He recently ended up in hot water involving my good friend James Marriott, and the drama channel Spill.
16177560	16182560	Marriott made content reacting to Nick's OnlyFans content, and Nick reacted to Marriott's reaction,
16182560	16184560	making some flirtatious remarks.
16184560	16190560	These, they're all batting for my team. I'm telling you, my radar is going ding ding ding ding ding, especially him.
16190560	16195560	Especially James, hotel boy. Marriott, a good place to sleep.
16195560	16201560	James then similarly responded, and people picked up on this exchange, with some taking it more seriously than others.
16201560	16206560	Eventually, Spill made a video on it, however, they appeared to misrepresent some of Marriott's comments,
16206560	16208560	portraying him as uncomfortable.
16208560	16215560	James was uncomfortable with the comments Nick made. For example, he called out Nick for using his last name in a way.
16215560	16219560	Just because my last name is a hotel, that does not mean that you can pay to with me.
16219560	16220560	James was off.
16220560	16223560	James clarifies this, and shows context to the clips.
16223560	16227560	For example, he called out Nick for using his last name in a way.
16227560	16232560	Just because my last name is a hotel, that does not mean that you can pay to with me.
16232560	16239560	Right. Okay, you cannot decide if I'm uncomfortable. First of all, what I was saying was a joke.
16239560	16243560	Proof of the fact that it was a joke is I'm now going to show you the clip they used in context.
16243560	16249560	Just because my last name is a hotel, that does not mean that you can pay to with me unless the price is right.
16249560	16254560	I literally told Mick Ocado that he could pay to with me. That is what I'm saying there.
16254560	16257560	I'm not saying I'm so uncomfortable with the idea that he's going to sit with me.
16257560	16261560	I literally joked about him sitting with me. That is not a man who is uncomfortable with the situation.
16261560	16266560	Now, I'll admit, although I find some of Nick's OnlyFans comments a tad ill-suited,
16266560	16271560	I know James, and he's a thick-skinned guy. Well, he's a bit thick in general, if you know what I'm saying.
16271560	16274560	And such comments aren't really cause for a spectacle.
16274560	16278560	Spill have since removed the video and apologised, which was the right thing to do.
16278560	16284560	Nick himself made a response video, although I think it evoked a few too many old memories for certain audiences.
16284560	16289560	Like, it's just gross. It's just gross. I'm just mad. I see these comments and I get so upset.
16289560	16291560	I'm sending this all to a lawyer.
16291560	16294560	Never letting off on the receipts in title trope, are we?
16294560	16297560	Of course, evoking the past trends make it harder to escape it,
16297560	16301560	and he does receive some pretty cruel comments from people coming across his content,
16301560	16305560	which does kinda make me feel sad. It obviously doesn't help that he tends to focus on them,
16305560	16310560	and talk about how you definitely shouldn't do it because it upsets him a lot in a baiting fashion,
16310560	16312560	but such is the cycle of provocation.
16312560	16315560	He has since appeared in an interview with James Merritt, and it's fine enough,
16315560	16320560	but I'd recommend watching it, although I do think he takes James' inexperience for a bit of a ride.
16320560	16325560	The story about you, I know a lot of your content can be falsified, it can be real, you know,
16325560	16327560	it's kind of like a mix, you never really know what you're gonna get.
16327560	16330560	The video where you spoke about a heart attack, did that actually happen to you?
16330560	16332560	It happened, yeah. Yes, it happened.
16332560	16337560	Oh my god. Talk me through that. How was that? I mean, how was your heart attack?
16337560	16338560	How tall are you?
16338560	16339560	I'm 6 foot 4.
16339560	16340560	Oh yeah, you're tall.
16340560	16342560	Yeah, I'm quite tall.
16342560	16343560	I'm 6 foot.
16343560	16345560	You're taller than I thought you'd be as well, though.
16345560	16346560	Yeah, I get that all the time.
16346560	16351560	Though he does say at some point he may become a weight loss channel, which I guess I wouldn't put it past him.
16351560	16353560	I look forward to that day.
16353560	16359560	Nikocado is one of those people who I don't really hate, but who I also don't necessarily feel bad for either.
16359560	16364560	Many of my friends find his content thoroughly amusing, and I think from a distance there is legitimate
16364560	16369560	entertainment in what he makes, but it also appears that it's something that should be enjoyed from a distance,
16369560	16374560	because when others have been caught up in the narrative, it seems that it can do more harm than good.
16374560	16379560	Whether he's playing it up for dramatic effect or not, it's still involving real people, whose awareness
16379560	16383560	of the content's nature ranges from possibly knowledgeable to completely ignorant.
16383560	16388560	There's been a lot of speculation about his husband Allin's involvement, who has regularly been implicated
16388560	16392560	in the drama, but has never really given people an indicative sign of his own knowledge.
16392560	16398560	I'm not really in a position to pass such judgement, but if Allin isn't in on the act, then Nik has truly done some
16398560	16403560	pretty rotten things, which are probably slightly less forgivable than what I've spoken about today.
16403560	16409560	Nik's never been in the most placid communities, I'll concede that, and this video isn't an impassioned offense
16409560	16415560	of everyone he's ever come into contact with, but Nik is like this twisted mirror which takes the community
16415560	16421560	and reflects its most dramatic faces. Mr Avocado thrived on the toxicity, often indulging in it,
16421560	16426560	and that's why many of these cliques will not remember him fondly at all. Whether that's how he'll be predominantly
16426560	16432560	remembered on YouTube is another question, one for both him and the audience that will pass such judgement.
16432560	16439560	This video isn't the end all of Nikocado Avocado content, those videos are unbelievable in length and discourse
16439560	16444560	and therefore it's hard to completely condense all the details. There are other videos which also take perspectives
16444560	16449560	which you're more than welcome to watch, and it's probably why this video has been a little longer than expected.
16449560	16453560	If you're really that interested, then watch the videos for yourself, and make your own verdict.
16453560	16458560	Regardless of mine, regardless of yours, we'll probably see more of this, this,
16459560	16464560	and hopefully a little less of this.
16464560	16469560	In the neverending nightmare of Nikocado Avocado.
16469560	16474560	Shubidoo what? Am I doing it right, Nik? Am I doing it right?
16476560	16481560	So yeah, that was the video, I hope you guys enjoyed, as you probably noticed it's quite a long video,
16481560	16487560	but congratulations if you made it this far, I wanna give a big thanks to my editors, my many editors on this one,
16487560	16492560	we've had a fair few, they're all up on screen now, go and check them out, send them some love, they do a fantastic job,
16492560	16498560	and I really appreciate them. I wanna give a big thanks to the sponsor again for funding this video,
16498560	16504560	being able to create such a lengthy, meaty piece gives me a bit more freedom and a bit more confidence
16504560	16509560	when I create this stuff that YouTube isn't gonna ruin me, so I really appreciate that as well.
16509560	16514560	And definitely go and check them out because I think it's a really good deal they've given me, 85% off Surfshark BPM,
16514560	16522560	thank you guys again. A big thanks to the patrons, I need to give a big thanks to my $10 patreons who are up on screen now,
16522560	16532560	doing a great job, I love you lots. $50 patrons, Amanda, Caroline, Devon, Hypercube, Rain, and Somehullerblue,
16532560	16541560	thank you very much. And a big thanks to my $100 patrons, we have A Little Lass, Brandon Junk, Christopher Carrasse,
16541560	16550560	Doddy, and Yesenia Ramirez and Candy Skulls, thank you so much for your support, I appreciate it a lot.
16550560	16555560	I don't really have too much else to add, other than obviously you can find me on my socials though,
16555560	16561560	I have been a bit more inactive recently due to being quite preoccupied with projects like this one,
16561560	16566560	so I do my best to be around nonetheless, and I haven't been responding too much,
16566560	16572560	though I must preface recently, and I do plan to correct that eventually, but I need to know my limits,
16572560	16576560	and I'm currently at those limits, so thanks for watching regardless guys,
16576560	16580560	and I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you in the next one.
16596560	16599560	you
