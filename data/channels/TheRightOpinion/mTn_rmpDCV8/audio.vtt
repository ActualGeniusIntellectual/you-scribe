00:00.000 --> 00:08.200
Mokbang, a community on YouTube built on the consumption of obscene amounts of food for

00:08.200 --> 00:10.320
the entertainment of bewildered onlookers.

00:10.320 --> 00:15.960
This is Nicholas Perry, aka Nikocado Avocado, a rather controversial figure on the platform.

00:15.960 --> 00:19.560
He's been in a few incidents that hit the bigwig's radar upstairs.

00:19.560 --> 00:21.560
Looks like a douchebag.

00:21.560 --> 00:23.560
You're one to talk.

00:23.560 --> 00:27.560
Recon agents have acquired its current location and are holding a perimeter on the Alpha site.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.560
You've been tasked with eliminating the target.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.560
Distraction points have been-

00:31.560 --> 00:33.560
Look, why exactly do we care?

00:33.560 --> 00:37.560
Well, you see, Alpha Strand doesn't even check that we want you to try out in the field.

00:37.560 --> 00:39.560
Hey, dude.

00:39.560 --> 00:41.560
What the f*** is this?

00:41.560 --> 00:43.560
What?

00:43.560 --> 00:49.560
Oh, no, you won't be able to access that video in your current location.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.560
That's stupid.

00:51.560 --> 00:53.560
Mm-hmm.

00:53.560 --> 00:57.560
If we could test out the incendiary plasma grenades on them, that'd be great.

00:57.560 --> 00:59.560
Incendiary pla- How'd those work?

00:59.560 --> 01:01.560
I just told you how they work.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.560
How am I supposed to watch this if it's blocked?

01:03.560 --> 01:05.560
I'm glad you asked.

01:07.560 --> 01:09.560
Well, well, well.

01:09.560 --> 01:11.560
Hey, Tro.

01:11.560 --> 01:13.560
Haven't seen you since Acapulco.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.560
Acapulco?

01:15.560 --> 01:17.560
F***, you told me we go to Acapulco together.

01:17.560 --> 01:19.560
That's our special place. Remember one time we-

01:19.560 --> 01:21.560
Look, man, can we not talk about that?

01:21.560 --> 01:23.560
Of course I'm listening to you.

01:23.560 --> 01:25.560
Listen, don't you guys normally have black hair?

01:25.560 --> 01:27.560
Well, yeah.

01:27.560 --> 01:29.560
That's a surprise you noticed, actually.

01:29.560 --> 01:31.560
Oh, you know I did. What'd you do to it?

01:31.560 --> 01:33.560
Well- I can't see your video, dude.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.560
That's because your location doesn't allow it.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.560
It's garbage.

01:37.560 --> 01:39.560
Just turn on your VPN.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.560
I don't know what that is.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.560
Well, then, I suppose I'll bring you up to speed.

01:43.560 --> 01:49.560
A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, is an online device which allows you to adjust or hide your IP address,

01:50.560 --> 01:55.560
while providing an additional layer of security for your personal data through the process of encryption.

01:55.560 --> 01:56.560
Huh.

01:56.560 --> 02:01.560
So, for example, after this rather stressful mission, you will probably want to unwind by watching a motion picture.

02:01.560 --> 02:06.560
However, you may find the current Netflix repertoire somewhat underwhelming or repetitive.

02:06.560 --> 02:14.560
By using Surfshark VPN, you can relocate to another country, which will offer you a new selection of films to quench your cinephilic designs.

02:14.560 --> 02:18.560
As a twat with too much free time, particularly in this lockdown, I know I've watched a lot recently.

02:18.560 --> 02:22.560
This is all well and good, but I don't watch that many movies, bud.

02:22.560 --> 02:26.560
Plus, the ladies keep me pretty busy, and you know how they are.

02:26.560 --> 02:27.560
One second.

02:27.560 --> 02:29.560
It was pretty scary, but, like-

02:29.560 --> 02:34.560
Oh my god, now how did you get it like that? Like, what's the technique? Like, you know-

02:34.560 --> 02:36.560
Oh yeah, well, what I do is-

02:37.560 --> 02:43.560
Well, what if you were researching one of your targets and a site which you needed access to was blocked?

02:43.560 --> 02:45.560
Go on.

02:45.560 --> 02:50.560
Using Surfshark VPN will allow you to adjust your settings to bypass this barrier.

02:50.560 --> 02:57.560
You can also use their clean web add-on to make sure those malicious sites out there don't pull the old switcheroo on you and compromise your security.

02:57.560 --> 02:58.560
Alright, what's the catch?

02:58.560 --> 03:00.560
No catch, just a deal.

03:00.560 --> 03:01.560
Send it.

03:01.560 --> 03:08.560
Well, the deal is, if you use code OPINION at checkout, you'll receive three months free alongside 85% off a two-year subscription,

03:08.560 --> 03:13.560
giving you over two years of Surfshark for the price of just four months.

03:13.560 --> 03:14.560
Is this an ad read?

03:14.560 --> 03:19.560
Hm. All you have to do is click the link in the description below and select the plan in reference.

03:19.560 --> 03:22.560
They even offer a 30-day money-back guarantee if you're not satisfied.

03:22.560 --> 03:25.560
So there's really, truly, no risk at all.

03:25.560 --> 03:28.560
You sly dog. Alright, I'mma get it, I'mma get it.

03:28.560 --> 03:29.560
TK.

03:29.560 --> 03:30.560
What?

03:30.560 --> 03:31.560
Are you kidding me?

03:31.560 --> 03:32.560
Look, Tro calls and put me on to something, right?

03:32.560 --> 03:33.560
Oh, hey, Tro.

03:33.560 --> 03:34.560
Ah, hello, Em.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.560
Finally told him about that VPN, huh?

03:36.560 --> 03:37.560
What?

03:37.560 --> 03:38.560
He's always been a bit slow, hasn't he?

03:38.560 --> 03:39.560
Always.

03:39.560 --> 03:40.560
Private call?

03:40.560 --> 03:41.560
Hey, pull up.

03:44.560 --> 03:48.560
I was so healthy.

03:48.560 --> 03:52.560
I had rice and beans and fish.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.560
Maybe this is all water weight.

03:54.560 --> 03:55.560
I'm holding on to water weight.

03:55.560 --> 03:57.560
I need to get this off my chest.

03:57.560 --> 04:00.560
I need to, you know, for my heart.

04:00.560 --> 04:01.560
For my heart.

04:01.560 --> 04:03.560
I don't even know why.

04:03.560 --> 04:04.560
I don't know what I did to deserve this.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.560
I have no idea what I did wrong.

04:06.560 --> 04:08.560
I am not having it today.

04:09.560 --> 04:25.560
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

04:25.560 --> 04:30.000
too much free time, and what a year 2020 has quickly devolved into.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.360
The turn of a new decade was met by excitement and anticipation from many, myself included.

04:35.360 --> 04:40.360
Needless to say, I think disappointed may be an understatement when summarising my sentiments.

04:40.360 --> 04:44.280
With the world falling down around us, it can be easy to lose faith in humanity, but

04:44.280 --> 04:46.480
maybe that faith was misplaced all along.

04:46.480 --> 04:47.480
What do I mean?

04:47.480 --> 04:49.760
Well, let's dabble into today's topic.

04:49.760 --> 04:50.760
Drama.

04:50.760 --> 04:54.420
In the world of YouTube, the word drama is typically used to refer to a conflict regarding

04:54.420 --> 04:57.000
a creator or multiple creators at that.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.280
It's a pretty central theme to the current content that I make on my channel, and is

05:00.280 --> 05:03.040
a focal point for multiple commentators alike.

05:03.040 --> 05:07.520
We tend to associate most drama with a more contemporary era of YouTube, originating from

05:07.520 --> 05:13.280
the mid 2010s, spearheaded by many commentators, and popularised by series like Content Cop.

05:13.280 --> 05:17.640
But drama has existed since the dawn of YouTube, but I remember all the way back in 2012 when

05:17.640 --> 05:22.840
I watched a lot of Call of Duty content, because, as you know, I am a gamer, and there was a

05:22.840 --> 05:27.320
very renowned Callout video uploaded which obtained well over a million views, and probably

05:27.320 --> 05:30.480
would have obtained many more if it hadn't been deleted.

05:30.480 --> 05:34.600
In an environment like that, such a statistic was hugely impressive, and it had a great

05:34.600 --> 05:39.600
impact on the YouTuber it was directed at who left the internet altogether shortly after.

05:39.600 --> 05:44.080
However, with the constant manifestation of communities, and lack of real culture surrounding

05:44.080 --> 05:48.400
the nature of drama, with it more seeming like an unintended side effect, nothing ever

05:48.400 --> 05:53.600
seemed to mould its way into YouTube history, and we tend to reminisce about the early 2010s

05:53.600 --> 05:57.200
on YouTube with the innocent nostalgia that we have since assigned to it.

05:57.200 --> 06:01.440
That's not a facet that can be considered with the commentary era, and since its rise,

06:01.440 --> 06:07.560
every major conflict seems like a blemish imprinted on this beautiful platform, for better and for worse.

06:07.560 --> 06:11.200
Yet the sensation that drama provokes has ever remained the same.

06:11.200 --> 06:16.520
It was still one of the most iconic feelings when that Call of Duty drama in 2012 was transpiring.

06:16.520 --> 06:20.440
It was a rush, someone being exposed, conflict within the community.

06:20.440 --> 06:25.320
The truth is plain, many creators and audiences alike thrive on drama.

06:25.360 --> 06:31.800
The appeal of it is indisputable, and as it has grown out of its reputation as a byproduct and into its own genre,

06:31.800 --> 06:36.840
it has become more powerful, and people feel less afraid to indulge their more dramatic side.

06:36.840 --> 06:41.840
On top of this, with the increased mobilisation of online communities, it has been granted additional

06:41.840 --> 06:45.560
consequential value that we can observe over the past few years.

06:45.560 --> 06:51.000
One of the most prominent outcomes of this is exposed culture, when a person makes strong or revelatory

06:51.000 --> 06:56.680
claims regarding another individual and their behaviour, typically with the intent of depicting a character

06:56.680 --> 07:01.480
that had previously not been shown to the audience. You might find someone sitting quite sternly,

07:01.480 --> 07:05.800
glaring at the camera, before going into the details of whatever they wish to disclose,

07:05.800 --> 07:11.320
or you might just see a neatly posted twit longer. The overarching message will tell you that this person

07:11.320 --> 07:17.120
isn't who you thought they were, whether it's mere business malpractice, or something a little more sinister.

07:17.160 --> 07:24.040
There can be very real ramifications. The mid-2010s weren't just for sowing the seeds of drama and commentary though,

07:24.040 --> 07:29.760
no, in fact, many new creative genres rose to YouTube prominence, one of those being Mukbang's.

07:29.760 --> 07:34.920
Mukbang is another delightful portmanteau whose literal translation would be eatcast.

07:34.920 --> 07:38.680
With such information, you can probably take a guess at what I'm referring to.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.400
Three, two, one, go.

07:42.400 --> 07:48.680
Yes, the videos where we have an individual consuming portions of food, often accompanied by them making casual chitchat

07:48.680 --> 07:56.160
with the audience. It originated in South Korea towards the end of the 2000s, but only really caught fire in 2015,

07:56.160 --> 08:02.000
when a few larger channels began to pay attention to it. Since then, we've seen a wave of creators all over the spectrum

08:02.000 --> 08:07.120
take part, either engaging in it as a side-venture, or as their dedicated pursuits.

08:07.120 --> 08:13.360
So we have drama and Mukbang simultaneously emerging into the limelight, two seemingly quite distinct genres,

08:13.360 --> 08:16.480
but what would you end up with if you merged the two together?

08:16.480 --> 08:36.320
Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce you to Nikocado Avocado, on one hand, a fairly straightforward Mukbang creator

08:36.320 --> 08:43.400
who just likes a good meal, on the other hand, a seemingly elaborate troll who will jump at the opportunity to be taken

08:43.440 --> 08:46.560
seriously, and use the power how he sees fits.

08:46.560 --> 08:54.760
I'm my own empire now, I'm the Mukbang king, and you messed with the wrong person.

08:54.760 --> 09:01.280
Over the last few years, he has emerged as an influential figure in the Mukbang community, obtaining millions of subscribers

09:01.280 --> 09:08.440
over five channels, nothing to be sneered at. However, his stint on the platform has been plagued with controversy,

09:08.480 --> 09:15.200
drama, exposés, and some pretty serious allegations, both given and taken, which may leave you wondering,

09:15.200 --> 09:21.840
how hard is it to eat your damn dinner? If this story was just about a guy who ate food and cried little,

09:21.840 --> 09:26.960
then there wouldn't be too much to say, but scratch below the surface and you'll find an extensive history of drama,

09:26.960 --> 09:33.480
chaos, and one of the strangest embodiments of exposed culture to boot. At the centre, a man who simultaneously

09:34.480 --> 09:40.800
never fails to fascinate the ardent YouTube commentator. How did he get here? How did we get here?

09:40.800 --> 09:46.800
Well, join me today as I tell you about the somewhat strange story behind the rise of Nikocado Avocado,

09:46.800 --> 09:52.520
and the rather twisted side to what could have been any other content creator, and the never-ending nightmare

09:52.520 --> 09:55.240
that Mr Avocado in fact represents.

09:55.240 --> 09:58.880
Eating food on camera? How problematic can that be?

09:58.880 --> 10:06.240
Do you know what it's like to be alive for 27 years? I don't even know what that means.

10:06.240 --> 10:11.520
What does it mean? What does it mean to be alive for 27 years? What does it mean?

10:11.520 --> 10:18.520
I'm just here, I'm just here, and I'm just stuck in this mess. I'm stuck.

10:19.960 --> 10:25.000
Well, Mr Avocado appears to have risen to the challenge, so I suggest we find out.

10:28.880 --> 10:46.680
As we have just outlined, Mukbang didn't emerge into the public consciousness until the early 2010s.

10:46.680 --> 10:52.800
This means that practically all Mukbang creators had alternative careers before their YouTube channels took off.

10:52.840 --> 10:59.040
Nikocado Avocado is no different in that regard, however, his story is one of particular curiosity.

10:59.040 --> 11:01.920
What do I mean? Well, let's start off with a little clip.

11:01.920 --> 11:22.680
That is obviously a wedding, however, there are a few details that may contribute to the intrigue.

11:22.680 --> 11:30.360
Firstly, it was a vegan wedding, and secondly, as you may notice, it was accompanied by a rather delightful violin recital.

11:30.440 --> 11:35.760
That violinist was someone by the name of Albert Einstein, I'm just f**king with you, it's Nikocado Avocado.

11:35.760 --> 11:43.760
Veganism affects not only yourself, but it affects other people, it affects the environment, it affects the animals,

11:43.760 --> 11:48.560
of course, animals that are being raised and killed for our consumption and usage.

11:48.560 --> 11:53.160
It affects us spiritually and mentally, physically, of course.

11:53.160 --> 11:59.560
Yes, this is Nikocado Avocado, as you can probably tell, he hasn't started making the Mukbang content

11:59.560 --> 12:05.760
that he is renowned for quite yet, in fact, he was on what many would interpret as the opposite end of the spectrum,

12:05.760 --> 12:08.360
he was indeed a vegan.

12:08.360 --> 12:18.960
This is the present. Look, Nikocado Avocado got an avocado. How cliche is this? So cliche, I can't even.

12:18.960 --> 12:26.120
Most content involving him in this phase was uploaded between 2014 and 2016, however, if you were feeling particularly

12:26.520 --> 12:32.520
inquisitive, you could dredge up an old Twitter which advertised his violin skills, including an audition for The Glee Project,

12:32.520 --> 12:38.920
which was a reality TV series where the winner could have their own 7 episode character arc on the titular show.

12:38.920 --> 12:46.120
Unfortunately for Nik, opportunity didn't come knocking this time, and his existence continued to be quite ordinary.

12:46.120 --> 12:50.920
This is where we should introduce another creator, this gentleman goes by the name of Orlin.

12:50.920 --> 12:56.520
Orlin had a YouTube channel known as Orlin Home, on this channel, he would post a lot of vegan related content,

12:56.520 --> 13:02.120
most of it has been removed, but thanks to this one old screenshot, and some old videos still up on his YouTube channel,

13:02.120 --> 13:06.920
you can see what the content, now belonging to one of Nik's alts, used to be.

13:06.920 --> 13:11.320
My name is Nicholas, and I'm hungry.

13:11.320 --> 13:23.720
Now, at this point, Orlin was in a relationship with our good friend Nik here, in fact, in this 2013 screenshot,

13:23.720 --> 13:27.920
you can see them posing for a very cute couple's profile pic, how adorable.

13:27.920 --> 13:33.440
Orlin lived in Colombia, and they would visit each other on a somewhat regular basis, however, this meant that

13:33.440 --> 13:38.320
Nik would feature in some of Orlin's videos, however, Orlin held down the channel.

13:38.320 --> 13:43.320
It seems, although he was active in the vegan community, YouTube wasn't always Nik's priority,

13:43.320 --> 13:46.320
although in a later video, he would say this.

13:46.320 --> 13:55.320
In 2012, 2013, one of the two, I put out this big animal rights video on my YouTube channel, on my old YouTube channel.

13:55.320 --> 14:00.320
Implying that he had been doing some online activism, though not under his current alias.

14:00.320 --> 14:08.320
No, it wouldn't be until 2014 that Nik would initiate Project Nikocado Avocado, and even then it would appear to be dormant,

14:08.320 --> 14:13.320
this screenshot showing that despite of his subscribers, he otherwise had no activity.

14:13.320 --> 14:20.320
Now, there was activity, but for many people looking, you'd have a hard time finding that, but we'll save that tea until later.

14:20.320 --> 14:26.320
This didn't mean he didn't upload, and wouldn't appear in various videos with other vegan creators, promoting that healthy lifestyle.

14:26.320 --> 14:32.320
Most of this collab content appeared throughout the span of 2016, while he was still identifying as a vegan.

14:32.320 --> 14:38.320
At this point, certain vegan creators have picked up the mukbang concept as a means to promote their lifestyle,

14:38.320 --> 14:45.320
and provide fairly easy-going, accessible content for audiences, especially those who may not be interested in veganism regardless.

14:45.320 --> 14:51.320
Nik collaborated with a few prominent creators at the time, including Brianna Jackson, Cheap Lazy Vegan,

14:51.320 --> 14:56.320
and the somewhat popular creator Mummy Tang, who by the way seems like the most delightful person,

14:56.320 --> 14:59.320
and I will be highly disappointed if she ends up being exposed.

15:11.320 --> 15:15.320
In a lot of the content that has remained on YouTube from this Nik Avocado era,

15:15.320 --> 15:18.320
there is definitely a lot of flexing regarding his healthy lifestyle.

15:18.320 --> 15:44.320
Now, some vegans are known to be vocal regarding the proclaimed health benefits that such a lifestyle can provide,

15:44.320 --> 15:50.320
and they are completely at liberty to do that, but Nik's comments never seemed to pertain the dogmatic conviction

15:50.320 --> 15:55.320
that I'd come to expect from such lifestyle professionals. Maybe I'm biased from what I know now,

15:55.320 --> 16:00.320
but after watching his pre-mukbang content, the transition began to make more sense than less.

16:00.320 --> 16:05.320
One video that did catch my interest was an upload where All In talks about Nik's first time.

16:05.320 --> 16:11.320
Now, if you were going by the title, you may assume something a bit more racy, however, it's actually the first time

16:12.320 --> 16:18.320
which given the channel branding is obviously a big deal. Nonetheless, elements of the rhetoric caught my attention.

16:34.320 --> 16:38.320
It seems that over the years, although it may not have been documented too clearly,

16:38.320 --> 16:44.320
All In and Nik's attitude to diet has seemingly softened, and at this point, although they may have still

16:44.320 --> 16:48.320
identified as vegans, they would gradually take more latitude within their lifestyle.

16:48.320 --> 16:53.320
This could also be seen in Nik's own content, although no longer on YouTube,

16:53.320 --> 16:58.320
I found some Facebook posts that do begin to show the transition his content made in 2016.

16:58.320 --> 17:04.320
He always seemed to trade in clickbait type content, and indulge in a more mainstream approach towards presentation

17:04.320 --> 17:09.320
than his partner. However, nothing really caught my attention until around July of that year, firstly,

17:09.320 --> 17:14.320
some routine mukbang content, but in the thumbnail, he would advertise how many calories are being consumed,

17:14.320 --> 17:19.320
a grand 2000 in that one. This calorie content would also increase in future uploads that month,

17:19.320 --> 17:25.320
and he'd go on to promote vegan food that in spite of their vegan nature was otherwise rather unhealthy.

17:25.320 --> 17:31.320
On top of this, there is another video uploaded a couple days later, which appears to be a pretty fiery response

17:31.320 --> 17:34.320
to another pair of creators within the vegan community.

17:34.320 --> 17:39.320
With this level of knowledge, we can tell that Nik's outspoken nature would lead to polarization,

17:39.320 --> 17:44.320
as displayed by many of his own comments around the time, and his mukbang style content showed the direction

17:44.320 --> 17:49.320
that he was headed. Over the next few months, his style would transform completely.

17:49.320 --> 17:51.320
Let's talk about that transformation.

18:02.320 --> 18:08.320
Now, Nik's transition has to be split into one of two stages, transition out of the vegan community,

18:08.320 --> 18:13.320
and transition out of veganism altogether, so I'll be splitting this into these two stages,

18:13.320 --> 18:15.320
and the observations that can be made with them.

18:15.320 --> 18:21.320
I am not a vegan, I'm sure many people will be aware of that, but at the same time, I'm rather indifferent to the lifestyle,

18:21.320 --> 18:27.320
and for many people, being vegan isn't something that they advertise on YouTube or in real life.

18:27.320 --> 18:33.320
However, vegans do receive a bit of stigma due to the self-superior attitude that a vocal few of them have.

18:33.320 --> 18:38.320
Now, I don't think this reputation is completely warranted, because every belief system which has what they perceive

18:38.320 --> 18:44.320
as moral foundations is bound to have some evangelical individuals. It's not that dissimilar to a religion.

18:44.320 --> 18:49.320
However, this means a few things. First of all, that the YouTube vegan community is probably gonna be a bit more dramatic

18:49.320 --> 18:55.320
than one might expect, because those most outspoken on their cause are often going to seek out mediums to maximize

18:55.320 --> 19:00.320
their influence, and when that happens, you'll likely have pushback, from outside, from people who hate your position

19:00.320 --> 19:05.320
as much as you hate theirs, and from within, from people who think that your attitude is the wrong way to bring

19:05.320 --> 19:10.320
change to the world. Nick definitely seemed like the sort of person to be quite vocal against those in his own community,

19:10.320 --> 19:16.320
and his posts seemed to prove that as well. Whether his points were rational or reasonable is another question which I

19:16.320 --> 19:21.320
wasn't really able to deduce from his titles or Facebook posts alone, so we'll save this point until later.

19:21.320 --> 19:27.320
However, one thing is certain, these sorts of dramas will lead to inevitable alienation from that community,

19:27.320 --> 19:33.320
and much less obligation for the binding values that drive such a clique. So with this personal experience,

19:33.320 --> 19:40.320
Nick decided to quit the vegan community, uploading a 35 minute video at the start of September, announcing this,

19:40.320 --> 19:42.320
with his own justifications.

19:42.320 --> 19:47.320
I haven't made a video for about one week now, and I have my reasons for that.

19:48.320 --> 19:55.320
I'm a little uncertain on how to properly begin this video, because there's a lot on my mind, and it comes from various angles.

19:55.320 --> 20:01.320
Now, this isn't the most necessary to the arc today, but it is an important pit stop, so I'll do my best to summarise.

20:01.320 --> 20:06.320
First of all, Nick is sick of the puritanical nature of certain factions of the vegan community.

20:06.320 --> 20:12.320
He's fed up of the quote, raw vegans, those who only support vegan food being eaten raw, and he's fed up of their

20:12.320 --> 20:17.320
attitude towards others within the community. He thought by leaving that community himself, he'd be able to escape

20:17.320 --> 20:23.320
those with that mentality, but ultimately, he was not able to, and realised this spilled over into all communities

20:23.320 --> 20:28.320
relating to veganism. I will now show a select number of clips which both reflect the nature of the video,

20:28.320 --> 20:31.320
and are definitely not ironic in the slightest.

20:32.320 --> 20:36.320
...to talk about your lifestyle. The cool thing to do is talk about someone's personal life, or this person's

20:36.320 --> 20:40.320
sent a d**k pic, or this person did this, or this person said this, and this person got cheated on.

20:40.320 --> 20:44.320
That's why this community s**t me now. This is why I want to leave.

20:44.320 --> 20:50.320
People fighting, people making videos about who texted who, who cheated on who, who said what, taking screenshots

20:50.320 --> 20:56.320
of comments from months ago and making dramatic videos about it. Like, if that is evident with just a few thousand

20:56.320 --> 21:00.320
people in the world who have gone vegan, then if the whole world goes vegan, we are not saved either.

21:00.320 --> 21:07.320
Mommy Tang, even Mommy Tang, who's done nothing to attack, or belittle, or chastise vegan YouTubers publicly,

21:07.320 --> 21:12.320
she still gets picked on, she still gets dramatic videos made about her, she still gets the crazies that are coming

21:12.320 --> 21:16.320
after her and threatening her life. What is with it with the vegans?

21:16.320 --> 21:22.320
As a side note, whoever's been messing with Mommy Tang better back up. You mess with Mommy Tang, you mess with me.

21:22.320 --> 21:28.320
Now, throughout the video, he still refers to himself as a vegan, and even states this towards the end.

21:29.320 --> 21:36.320
I'm still vegan, I love animals, I care for them, I haven't had animal products for over four and a half years,

21:36.320 --> 21:42.320
but I'm done talking about it, which is really, really unfortunate. I'm done saying vegan, because I know it turns

21:42.320 --> 21:47.320
so many people off, and even the people that are on your team are the first ones to bat you on the head,

21:47.320 --> 21:49.320
just look at this community, you guys.

21:49.320 --> 21:55.320
This was not the end of the vegan diet for Nick Avocado, it was just the end of the vegan community,

21:55.320 --> 22:00.320
and although the like to dislike ratio on this video doesn't flatter him, it's not an unreasonable video

22:00.320 --> 22:05.320
for what it's worth. Although he had shown capability to involve himself with drama in the past,

22:05.320 --> 22:10.320
this seemed like a distancing from that, and he was ready to move on and be more mature.

22:10.320 --> 22:15.320
Over the next few months, he would gradually adjust his content to that more mukbang oriented.

22:15.320 --> 22:19.320
There were other uploads, but they were generally phased out. One observation that you could make

22:19.320 --> 22:23.320
is that although the food was still vegan, it wasn't exactly healthy.

22:23.320 --> 22:27.320
I don't think I'm making any shocking revelations here, but vegan food isn't always healthy,

22:27.320 --> 22:32.320
and some substitutes can be very unhealthy. Nick was definitely playing more into the cheat day side

22:32.320 --> 22:36.320
of a vegan diet, apart from the fact that he was cheating every day.

22:36.320 --> 22:42.320
Nick- Sloths, welcome to another mukbang. Seriously, you guys, I've been busy all day long.

22:42.320 --> 22:48.320
I started out with an entire Domino's Pizza onto myself down my throat,

22:48.320 --> 22:53.320
and then I also had Subway, the entire sub, down my throat.

22:53.320 --> 22:57.320
And this is not included in all the fruit I had in the morning, plus a little rice.

22:57.320 --> 23:03.320
Now it's dinner time. I've filmed three mukbangs back today, and here I go.

23:03.320 --> 23:08.320
However, some of the videos became very popular, and looking at an old Social Blade screenshot,

23:08.320 --> 23:11.320
you could see that his success came rapidly with the change in content.

23:11.320 --> 23:16.320
Certain videos did extremely well, and subscribers began to flood in at an unprecedented rate.

23:16.320 --> 23:23.320
It seems by leaving a toxic community behind, he was able to carve out his own niche of casually vegan mukbang content.

23:23.320 --> 23:26.320
However, Nick wasn't quite satisfied with this.

23:26.320 --> 23:30.320
Nick- Right then and there. So anyways, now I eat whatever I want, as long as it's plant-based,

23:30.320 --> 23:35.320
but I still, my memory, you guys, is bad.

23:35.320 --> 23:42.320
My clumsiness is getting out of hand. No matter how much I eat, how much I sleep,

23:42.320 --> 23:49.320
how much I exercise, excuse me, eat my fruits and veggies, and even have my fun with fried food.

23:49.320 --> 23:52.320
Sometimes, I have doubts.

23:52.320 --> 23:57.320
These concerns would all be put on show in his video called I Don't Want To Be Vegan Anymore,

23:57.320 --> 24:03.320
which showcases Nick wrestling back and forth with his animal rights principles and dietary requirements.

24:03.320 --> 24:09.320
But I have to be myself, and I have to be honest with how I feel if I want to keep doing this, right?

24:10.320 --> 24:15.320
But you just want me to lie, and say that this is how humans were designed to be,

24:15.320 --> 24:18.320
even though there's never been a culture or civilization on Earth to ever do it.

24:18.320 --> 24:24.320
It's okay, that's what's really natural. Even when we're evolving, eating bugs and other animals in the rainforests.

24:24.320 --> 24:27.320
It's okay, don't worry about them. What I'm doing is right and natural.

24:27.320 --> 24:32.320
It definitely showcases a more emotional side to him, and being emotional isn't an inherently bad thing,

24:32.320 --> 24:36.320
but the video itself is pretty unfocused, and doesn't seem to have the clarity of reasoning

24:36.320 --> 24:39.320
that his video on departing the vegan community had.

24:40.320 --> 24:45.320
We come from different parts of the world. We have different abilities to tolerate this and that.

24:45.320 --> 24:52.320
Some people just like bananas. Some people hate bananas. Some people can't stand lentils. Some people like them.

24:52.320 --> 24:58.320
Some people have different genes. Did you know? Did you know that this is so true?

24:58.320 --> 25:05.320
You know, I used to believe, oh we're all evil. No. It's so true that there is a huge foundation

25:05.320 --> 25:09.320
to investigate and study the Jewish genes.

25:09.320 --> 25:13.320
It's not like I don't think there are reasons why one may need to change dietary consumption.

25:13.320 --> 25:17.320
I doubt that the amount of vegan food consumption would have been good for you.

25:17.320 --> 25:22.320
But Nick seems to be more improvising on the spot, rather than explaining why he's made a thought out decision.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.320
Here are some highlights.

25:24.320 --> 25:29.320
I think I'm missing something. It's so annoying. Like I told myself it's a blessing disguise that I do eating shows,

25:29.320 --> 25:34.320
because I can eat an insane amount of food every single day and stay relatively thin, whatever.

25:34.320 --> 25:39.320
But that doesn't mean I feel good. And it's annoying to have to eat so often.

25:39.320 --> 25:46.320
It is annoying to have to like be obsessed. Be obsessed. What am I going to eat next?

25:46.320 --> 25:49.320
Where am I going to get my food? Is that vegan? Is that vegan too?

25:49.320 --> 25:55.320
Now I have to vegan. It's annoying. If you're deficient in something, it doesn't matter how much you tell yourself.

25:55.320 --> 25:59.320
Well, I'm going to do it for the animals. I'm going to do it to save the environment, save the trees.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.320
The poor trees are being chopped down for cows right now.

26:01.320 --> 26:07.320
I need to just, you can't be deficient for that long for the trees or for the cows.

26:07.320 --> 26:09.320
Does that make sense biologically?

26:09.320 --> 26:13.320
Crooked. Do you guys know The Richest? It was a video about the world's oldest people.

26:13.320 --> 26:19.320
Okay. And it had like 20 old, the world's oldest people, not a single one of them were vegan. Okay.

26:19.320 --> 26:26.320
And the oldest lived lady on earth ate three eggs a day. And that was her secret to living long.

26:26.320 --> 26:32.320
Now I'm not saying everyone should eat three eggs a day, but I am showing that we aren't all the same.

26:32.320 --> 26:38.320
You don't understand the reason I changed the type of vegan diet I eat so much year after year after year after year.

26:39.320 --> 26:44.320
It's because eventually what I was doing didn't feel right. And I feel like I'm at the end.

26:44.320 --> 26:51.320
What is there left to try? Supplementing 15,000 things every day? I don't have that kind of money.

26:51.320 --> 26:56.320
So that's not an option. I'm not going to do juice cleanses. I'm not going to fast.

26:56.320 --> 27:00.320
I'm not going to go back to raw food. I'm not going to eat just potatoes.

27:00.320 --> 27:06.320
I'm not just going to eat rice and sugar. They don't make me feel good long-term.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.320
Let's talk about this more.

27:10.320 --> 27:14.320
Alright, so you can say what you want about his videos. They're a bit strange and hard to follow,

27:14.320 --> 27:20.320
and it's easy to look at his content and think that he may have his own reasons for wanting to leave vegan content behind.

27:20.320 --> 27:25.320
He's talking about the health of his diet, but ultimately there's nothing particularly healthy in what he was doing.

27:25.320 --> 27:30.320
How many of his viewers pointed this out at the time? Vegan substitutes don't place you above the health consequences

27:30.320 --> 27:33.320
when you're ingesting colossal volumes for YouTube content.

27:33.320 --> 27:38.320
However, although he may seem a tad ignorant, you wouldn't notice much provocation in his language.

27:38.320 --> 27:44.320
Sure, he may have some accountability issues, but it was possible to give his intent the benefit of the doubt,

27:44.320 --> 27:49.320
for the moment at least. That moment lasted shorter than one might expect, as less than 4 days later,

27:49.320 --> 27:54.320
he uploaded a video called Why Veganism is Wrong and Makes People Go Crazy.

27:54.320 --> 27:59.320
In the 50 minute video, he ups his arguments to 11, but something feels kinda off.

28:00.320 --> 28:05.320
To think that we live in a world where it's just pure and there's never consequences,

28:05.320 --> 28:12.320
or to be healthy, you don't have to contribute to something bad in order to get positive effects from it,

28:12.320 --> 28:17.320
doesn't make sense. I mean, it might be a stretch, correct me if I'm wrong, but it very well could be,

28:17.320 --> 28:23.320
but I'm thinking these are just little examples. I think of the Holocaust. The Holocaust was an awful, awful thing.

28:23.320 --> 28:29.320
People had to suffer. People were displaced around the world. People were angry.

28:29.320 --> 28:38.320
But what came of it? New laws. Change. Beautiful, beautiful art. Beautiful, beautiful music.

28:38.320 --> 28:42.320
Sometimes, light comes out of darkness.

28:42.320 --> 28:49.320
A lot of the video is him speaking very broadly about this idea of veganism, without any concise direction.

28:49.320 --> 28:55.320
A lot of the time, I was unsure about the point he was trying to prove, even though he had some all-caps bold title

28:55.320 --> 29:00.320
with a very clear point, the video itself didn't have that bite, no pun intended.

29:00.320 --> 29:04.320
There are a lot of anecdotes, and mostly about people who Nick knew.

29:04.320 --> 29:08.320
You don't think I've tried. Maybe you guys don't remember the interviews.

29:08.320 --> 29:13.320
Skype called Dr. McDougall, Dr. Fuhrman, talked to Michael Greger.

29:13.320 --> 29:20.320
I remember there was this one girl, very, very, very popular. She was one of the most watched YouTube channel.

29:20.320 --> 29:25.320
You don't know who I'm talking about. It's a mysterious person. But she was vegan. This was five, six years ago.

29:25.320 --> 29:31.320
There was a huge train of people coming out. This only happened within a few months, and then they were just kind of ignored,

29:31.320 --> 29:33.320
and hopefully what they were saying would disappear.

29:33.320 --> 29:35.320
A lot of you guys that knew me back then are probably going to know who I'm talking about.

29:35.320 --> 29:40.320
A huge train of people, group of people that all got blood works, and they had high triglycerides.

29:40.320 --> 29:45.320
I remember, I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable, but I will say, without saying their names,

29:45.320 --> 29:52.320
they were their three brothers, and they were very popular, and they had all these fans,

29:52.320 --> 29:56.320
and they were really into building muscle, and being athletes, and this and that.

29:56.320 --> 30:00.320
In another example, I was literally just out of the blue. This is perfect timing.

30:00.320 --> 30:04.320
Just a week ago, maybe, maybe even less, like five days ago, I was on the phone with a friend,

30:04.320 --> 30:10.320
and she told me about this guy that was very like, rah, rah, rah, animal rights, animal rights, animal rights,

30:10.320 --> 30:15.320
and he participated in protests, and I think he did a few undercover slaughterhouse investigate,

30:15.320 --> 30:19.320
like helped produce those videos, or spread the social media, something like that.

30:19.320 --> 30:23.320
Very, very enthusiastic about it, and he was vegan for three years, I think.

30:23.320 --> 30:27.320
Two, two or three years, not like a long, long time, but still, you know, three years is a long time.

30:27.320 --> 30:32.320
Twenty minutes ago, today is Monday, I literally got a message on Facebook from a friend,

30:32.320 --> 30:35.320
she's really, really nice, and I kind of hung out with her this summer and stuff,

30:35.320 --> 30:39.320
and she sent me a message saying, hey, I saw your first video about questioning veganism,

30:39.320 --> 30:43.320
and I want to let you know that, you know, you're in doubt, and that's okay,

30:43.320 --> 30:47.320
and I want, I'm here for you if you want to talk, because she's vegan, but her partner stopped being vegan.

30:47.320 --> 30:51.320
He had been vegan for like eight years, like a long, long time, eight years, ten years, twelve years,

30:51.320 --> 30:56.320
like a long time. Yeah, basically said that, you know, it was very scary, because they're circle friends,

30:56.320 --> 30:58.320
they weren't sure how they would treat him, and this and that.

30:58.320 --> 31:02.320
Okay, I got an email from someone named ****, don't want to say her name,

31:02.320 --> 31:06.320
and she's basically saying, look, I followed your path as well, she's been vegan for ten years.

31:06.320 --> 31:13.320
He specifically asked me not to share this message, but he is Native American,

31:13.320 --> 31:20.320
and he told me that there's this huge misconception that Native Americans were very sad when they had a cure,

31:20.320 --> 31:22.320
and they felt so sad that they did it because it's all they had.

31:22.320 --> 31:25.320
Jesus Christ, Nick, is there anyone you don't know?

31:25.320 --> 31:30.320
And it's not like I don't believe these people don't exist, a good anecdote can always spice up a video,

31:30.320 --> 31:37.320
but when used to the degree that Nick uses them, it feels like a limp substitute for real evidence-based arguments,

31:37.320 --> 31:39.320
that Nick himself seems to be aware of.

31:39.320 --> 31:43.320
Saying things without concrete evidence, using cherry-pick studies, it's no, listen,

31:43.320 --> 31:46.320
I know the meat industry probably does the same thing, so people buy more of their products,

31:46.320 --> 31:53.320
but there has to be a happy medium, and there is a reason why a lot of people have problems down the road.

31:53.320 --> 31:58.320
If I was to provide a personal opinion on the video, it feels like Nick had already made the decision,

31:58.320 --> 32:04.320
and was trying to play out his transition as naturally as possible, perhaps justify it to himself,

32:04.320 --> 32:08.320
though he may have a point about the craziest thing, given that two uploads later,

32:08.320 --> 32:11.320
he's really out here putting pineapples on his pizza.

32:11.320 --> 32:15.320
I could say more about this video, but it is rather tame for what the title may imply,

32:15.320 --> 32:20.320
however, one important takeaway, other than the food, is that Nick wasn't running from drama anymore.

32:20.320 --> 32:26.320
The video's provocative title and opening tone was more than enough to irritate defensive vegans,

32:26.320 --> 32:29.320
some of whom, I'm sure, were part of Nick's own audience.

32:29.320 --> 32:33.320
He frames it like a personal battle, but when you brand your video with such broad strokes,

32:33.320 --> 32:36.320
you're not far off the backlash, and he wasn't.

32:36.320 --> 32:41.320
That video scored a negative light to dislike ratio, with many people expressing their disappointment.

32:42.320 --> 32:45.320
However, there's no way that someone like Nick didn't anticipate this,

32:45.320 --> 32:49.320
he had already shown an awareness of the toxicity, what were his intentions?

32:49.320 --> 32:53.320
Well, over the next few months, Nick began to reveal these intentions,

32:53.320 --> 32:57.320
he made a couple more vegan videos, but then began to advertise his shift away from veganism,

32:57.320 --> 33:01.320
finally celebrating his full departure with a trip to Domino's Pizza.

33:01.320 --> 33:05.320
An interesting choice, considering one of his concerns about veganism were the health risks.

33:05.320 --> 33:10.320
These health risks continued to escalate over future videos, bringing his intent into question,

33:10.320 --> 33:14.320
nevertheless, he continued to proclaim the benefits of his new diet.

33:15.320 --> 33:22.320
I gave it an honest attempt like no other, and sure, I was skinny for the majority of all these diets.

33:22.320 --> 33:26.320
I feel like I'm even thinner now than many points when I was raw vegan.

33:27.320 --> 33:33.320
Such a swollen face, and I still get very swollen faces, and I'm gonna talk about this in this video.

33:34.320 --> 33:37.320
It's been every single day of eating animal products.

33:38.320 --> 33:43.320
I... feel so... good.

33:45.320 --> 33:50.320
It's like a light bulb went off, it's like I shooed off a light.

33:53.320 --> 33:57.320
It's like a new set of batteries have been implanted into my head.

33:59.320 --> 34:01.320
Talk about sustainable energy.

34:02.320 --> 34:06.320
And I'm not gonna be the one to defend the vegan diet as the ideal lifestyle for everyone,

34:06.320 --> 34:09.320
but Nick's solution wasn't the reasonable answer.

34:09.320 --> 34:13.320
In his vegan questioning content, he spoke a lot of the time about bringing up diet

34:13.320 --> 34:16.320
and what human beings need to maintain a balanced intake.

34:16.320 --> 34:20.320
Okay, maybe 50 of you, there's 50, you've got 50 people right now.

34:20.320 --> 34:23.320
You're watching this video and you're in the same position as me,

34:23.320 --> 34:27.320
you've been vegan for many, many years, and you're starting to have some doubts.

34:27.320 --> 34:31.320
And maybe you're getting some blood work back, and your B12's low, and your iron's low,

34:31.320 --> 34:34.320
your omegas are low, your calcium is low, you're not getting vitamin K2.

34:35.320 --> 34:39.320
Where do you get vitamin K2? How do you absorb calcium if you're not eating sauerkraut every day?

34:39.320 --> 34:42.320
Well, there's K2 in animal products, but what do you do if you don't eat them?

34:42.320 --> 34:46.320
There's all these different things. Abimin. Where do you get them? Huh?

34:46.320 --> 34:51.320
However, in response to this, he merely introduces meat to his already excessive diet,

34:51.320 --> 34:55.320
indulging himself to outrageous proportions, 10,000 calorie challenges,

34:55.320 --> 35:00.320
so much past food, I'm surprised he can't single-handedly support their value on the stock market.

35:00.320 --> 35:04.320
Because of this, people began picking up on his rather unhealthy consumption habits,

35:04.320 --> 35:08.320
and raising their concerns that this was not conducive to the lifestyle he had previously aspired for.

35:08.320 --> 35:14.320
However, in the true nature of the internet, some people went a tad too far and began diagnosing him with eating disorders.

35:14.320 --> 35:19.320
A lot of these people who were attacking Nick appeared to be those of the vegan lifestyle,

35:19.320 --> 35:25.320
and ultimately, he used a lot of this to justify another video against these individuals who were coming at him on his channel.

35:26.320 --> 35:35.320
Over the past month, I have gotten thousands. Thousands.

35:35.320 --> 35:44.320
To the extent where I have friends reaching out to me, people I haven't even talked to for like a year or two,

35:44.320 --> 35:48.320
sending me messages on Facebook or even emails.

35:49.320 --> 35:57.320
Nick, I heard that you have an eating disorder, and I just want to let you know I'm here for you,

35:57.320 --> 36:00.320
if you need help with it or talking about it.

36:00.320 --> 36:07.320
Nick, I heard that you're throwing up your food. You have bulimia.

36:07.320 --> 36:12.320
And, you know, why didn't you tell me? I thought I was your best friend.

36:13.320 --> 36:19.320
I have to say, I'm somewhat skeptical that it's thousands of people, but we will entertain this for the sake of discourse.

36:19.320 --> 36:25.320
Now, I don't think it was fair to accuse him of being bulimic, or assigning any eating disorder without clear proof.

36:25.320 --> 36:28.320
You can always tell someone to go get help because they may have a problem,

36:28.320 --> 36:33.320
but straight up shouting at them is never gonna make them listen, and Nick had chosen a perspective at that point.

36:33.320 --> 36:39.320
He was going to dig in his heels as much as possible, so a lot of people coming at him was just perfect ammunition to fire back,

36:39.320 --> 36:41.320
which is what he did.

36:41.320 --> 36:49.320
I have been doing mukbangs for months, many months, ever since last January of 2016, that's been a year.

36:49.320 --> 36:53.320
I mean, it wasn't that regular back then, it was maybe once every two weeks, once a week, something like that,

36:53.320 --> 36:58.320
but I've been doing them every single day for like four months, eating plant-based foods.

36:58.320 --> 37:02.320
But, when I stopped being vegan, all the vegans now are coming on saying,

37:02.320 --> 37:07.320
oh, you have bulimia, oh, you have purging. They never said it before if I was eating the vegan calories,

37:07.320 --> 37:11.320
but since the calories are coming from animal products, oh, I have an eating disorder.

37:11.320 --> 37:16.320
That is terrible. I don't even know the rationale.

37:16.320 --> 37:21.320
This is reasonable content to make a video on in principle, but for a person who had previously shined away from drama,

37:21.320 --> 37:24.320
he was suddenly, once again, rather outspoken.

37:24.320 --> 37:28.320
Now, there are many theories for why this may be, but for me, at this point, it seemed quite straightforward.

37:28.320 --> 37:32.320
He wanted to rebuke many naysayers who were saying he couldn't pull off this transition,

37:32.320 --> 37:35.320
while also strengthening some bonds with his most loyal subscribers.

37:35.320 --> 37:40.320
He had built up this brand as the former vegan who had made content on them in the past.

37:40.320 --> 37:44.320
He was aware of how volatile some of them can be, but rather than running away from them,

37:44.320 --> 37:50.320
he was running towards them, blowing off that drama, facing off their points about his new diet and the health considerations.

37:50.320 --> 37:56.320
Make no mistake, the worst of a community is never pleasant, but sometimes behind the worthless anger,

37:56.320 --> 38:01.320
there may be a legitimate point, and Nick was about to start losing that argument.

38:05.320 --> 38:12.320
INTRO

38:12.320 --> 38:15.320
Nick's always been a rather calculated creator.

38:15.320 --> 38:18.320
You can often tell this by the construction of his thumbnails and titles,

38:18.320 --> 38:22.320
although certain behavioural patterns may have an arc, his clickbait doesn't.

38:22.320 --> 38:26.320
With his content, he'll be sat down on the verge of tears in many screenshots,

38:26.320 --> 38:29.320
crying profusely, such as I'm sorry I was wrong.

38:29.320 --> 38:34.320
Looks very emotional, but the video itself is just him talking for 35 minutes in a rather calm tone.

38:34.320 --> 38:41.320
So, during my journey, not all of it, but many moments of it, I just treated my own race,

38:41.320 --> 38:46.320
my own species, like dirt, because of what they were eating.

38:46.320 --> 38:54.320
So I have a list here, again, this is not to stereotype, this is not to degrade, this is not to be disrespectful,

38:54.320 --> 39:00.320
this is about what happened to me and my experience, alright, my mistakes.

39:00.320 --> 39:03.320
In this video, he once again spoke about the vegan community,

39:03.320 --> 39:07.320
this time apologising to those he alienated while he was a vegan.

39:07.320 --> 39:10.320
However, in some interesting retrospective reframing,

39:10.320 --> 39:12.320
he states that although he was obviously confused at the time,

39:12.320 --> 39:17.320
his main priority for shifting away from veganism was for the sake of mental health,

39:17.320 --> 39:19.320
and the truth is, he has never felt better.

39:19.320 --> 39:24.320
Did I decide I wanted to stop? I made a few videos, they were very controversial,

39:24.320 --> 39:28.320
I was confused as ever, talking about how the primary reason for me was mental health,

39:28.320 --> 39:33.320
that was the number one thing I said over and over, I felt like something was wrong in my head.

39:33.320 --> 39:37.320
Now this isn't exactly what he was previously arguing, but hey, good for him.

39:37.320 --> 39:40.320
If he makes him feel mentally better, then that's what matters.

39:40.320 --> 39:46.320
I have to admit, the cynic in me looked at this video as another rather underhanded way to get at vegans,

39:46.320 --> 39:50.320
but he does defend the lifestyle, and it would be a lot of effort to just prove a single point,

39:50.320 --> 39:55.320
so it would be unfair of me to make a judgement call, in spite of my thoughts about the levels of calculation.

39:55.320 --> 39:59.320
There's another point that I'll bring attention to with recognition to his drama videos,

39:59.320 --> 40:02.320
they often obtained less views than his mukbang content,

40:02.320 --> 40:06.320
which means that his motives for these videos weren't exactly view oriented.

40:06.320 --> 40:10.320
With that in mind, they didn't feel completely sincere either.

40:10.320 --> 40:16.320
Now, with the knowledge of where Nick is today, everyone has one video where they think his behaviour began to unravel.

40:16.320 --> 40:21.320
Now, as you can probably observe with what we know thus far, it has been a gradual process,

40:21.320 --> 40:26.320
however, for me, it takes a nosedive with one particular video, known as This Is Not Okay,

40:26.320 --> 40:31.320
which unlike other videos, lives up to the thumbnail, but I kinda wish it hadn't.

40:31.320 --> 40:35.320
You know, Orlin was trying to help me, because I am, I am clueless in the kitchen,

40:35.320 --> 40:39.320
I don't even know how to cut a carrot.

40:42.320 --> 40:46.320
It's a very uncomfortable video where Nick airs his painful relationship issues with Orlin,

40:46.320 --> 40:51.320
basically going back over a situation, and frankly, some rather inappropriate details.

40:51.320 --> 40:56.320
Nick- I took the dive, and I said, what are you doing?

40:59.320 --> 41:03.320
And he was so sad, he's just like, I hate my life, I hate my life, I hate my life.

41:05.320 --> 41:09.320
There are multiple aspects that I thoroughly dislike about this video, firstly the excessive crying.

41:09.320 --> 41:13.320
Now, emotion is okay to an extent, sometimes we channel emotion through our rhetoric,

41:13.320 --> 41:16.320
and that can be constructive to conveying our feelings,

41:16.320 --> 41:19.320
but when it's emotional to the point of interrupting the video's message,

41:19.320 --> 41:24.320
then to many it can feel manipulative, particularly combined with the process of editing and uploading.

41:24.320 --> 41:28.320
Now, with that said, the emotions do match what he's talking about in the video,

41:28.320 --> 41:31.320
I would probably be thoroughly upset too, but that's the second point,

41:31.320 --> 41:34.320
there is no way that this content should have been uploaded,

41:34.320 --> 41:37.320
it's graphic details regarding someone else's struggle,

41:37.320 --> 41:40.320
and unless you're presenting it with their permission and in a helpful way,

41:40.320 --> 41:42.320
then you should not be uploading it.

41:42.320 --> 41:47.320
A formally pinned, and possibly now deleted comment by Orlin stated that he had provided permission

41:47.320 --> 41:53.320
as the video was filmed two days after, however, this is directly contradicted by Nick's own statements in the video.

41:53.320 --> 41:57.320
Nick- Last night we were in bed, we were in here, and he came up the stairs,

41:57.320 --> 42:01.320
and his stomach comes out of his arm.

42:01.320 --> 42:04.320
So something happened just right now.

42:04.320 --> 42:09.320
This brings into question the creation and intent of such an upload, and the nature of this relationship.

42:09.320 --> 42:13.320
On top of this, given the video's reactionary tone, it gives me an even stronger impression

42:13.320 --> 42:17.320
that it wasn't something that was created as a reflection a couple days after,

42:17.320 --> 42:22.320
and even if it was, it doesn't feel like it represented a truth, more a means of exploitation.

42:22.320 --> 42:25.320
However, this brings me to my greatest problem.

42:26.320 --> 42:31.320
Nick- So I don't know what to think, I remember we were late in bed last night,

42:31.320 --> 42:37.320
and I was saying to myself, like, this is not good, we're about to get buried.

42:37.320 --> 42:43.320
And I made him so upset that he **** himself.

42:43.320 --> 42:48.320
The fact that Nick makes it about himself, and that's what I really dislike about it,

42:48.320 --> 42:52.320
the waterworks that draw attention away from the actual story, and more to his reaction,

42:52.320 --> 42:56.320
the almost irrelevant anecdotes that seek to justify his position,

42:56.320 --> 43:00.320
it gives the impression that he's asking for sympathy from his audience for a situation

43:00.320 --> 43:03.320
that they wouldn't have been aware of regardless, and they should not be,

43:03.320 --> 43:05.320
certainly not for a video like this at least.

43:05.320 --> 43:10.320
The only content of value to any audience member is the information at the end that

43:10.320 --> 43:14.320
All In has broken up with Nick, and that is a negligible proportion of the video.

43:14.320 --> 43:19.320
Nick- You know, I almost died two days ago, you guys know about this,

43:19.320 --> 43:23.320
I almost died because I drank too much water, and I didn't want to go to the hospital

43:23.320 --> 43:29.320
because I didn't want to get the IV, because it freaked me out.

43:29.320 --> 43:34.320
Now, some of the emotions do feel quite legitimate in the video, which may soften my opinion a little,

43:34.320 --> 43:37.320
but either way, it doesn't alter my stance on the existence of it,

43:37.320 --> 43:40.320
and what it represents in the timeline of Mr Avocado.

43:40.320 --> 43:45.320
Some of his audience also observe this unsuitability, though many others express sympathy for Nick,

43:45.320 --> 43:47.320
which also proves my point.

43:47.320 --> 43:50.320
I'll add that another comment appears to imply that this video was originally titled

43:50.320 --> 43:56.320
Something Much More Inappropriate and Crats, but there were bigger fish to fry for Nick Ocado.

43:56.320 --> 44:00.320
You see, a week later he uploads another emotional video on this topic.

44:00.320 --> 44:05.320
Nick- Hey guys, it's me, I just came upstairs to the bedroom, I stand by my bed,

44:05.320 --> 44:13.320
I turn on the camera, and I just, I need, I need, I need to get this off my chest,

44:13.320 --> 44:20.320
I need to, you know, from my heart, from my heart, I'm a good person, I swear.

44:20.320 --> 44:25.320
In this video, he once again becomes extremely upset, this time over the fact that some people were accusing Nick

44:25.320 --> 44:28.320
and All In of faking this situation for views.

44:28.320 --> 44:30.320
Now, this video is important for two primary reasons.

44:30.320 --> 44:34.320
Nick exhibits a clear tendency to focus on these negative outlines,

44:34.320 --> 44:39.320
in spite of some understandably frustrated viewers, many people had responded sympathetically to his previous video,

44:39.320 --> 44:43.320
yet Nick magnifies this negative response, frames them with serious allegations,

44:43.320 --> 44:46.320
and gets another 11 minutes of emotional content out of it.

44:46.320 --> 44:59.320
Nick- People are so, so, so mean, every little thing I do, everything, people are trying to bring me down,

44:59.320 --> 45:02.320
people are trying to tear me down, people are trying to knock me down to the ground,

45:02.320 --> 45:06.320
and I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't take it anymore, I can't take it.

45:06.320 --> 45:11.320
But what I do know is that what happened was not made up, it was not fake, it was not a show,

45:11.320 --> 45:21.320
it's not all these things that people were saying, it was so real, it's so real that I see the scars.

45:21.320 --> 45:26.320
Second, this more emotional content appeared to be a new precedent for how Nick wanted to treat, quote,

45:26.320 --> 45:30.320
drama, and with this video, a significant share of his audience took issue with this,

45:30.320 --> 45:34.320
stating that he should probably avoid projecting all these personal issues onto the internet.

45:34.320 --> 45:38.320
This wasn't just one or two trolls, this was a decent number of his own audience,

45:38.320 --> 45:41.320
saying that he needed to re-evaluate his approach to YouTube,

45:41.320 --> 45:44.320
all the warning signs were there for the route that he was heading down.

45:44.320 --> 45:48.320
However, what was most important was the creation of this new persona,

45:48.320 --> 45:52.320
the new emotional, irrational, dramatic persona,

45:52.320 --> 45:58.320
and one which could pretty much take on any narrative at any point, it was a chameleon.

45:58.320 --> 46:01.320
This was a turning point for me, whether the videos were sincere or not,

46:01.320 --> 46:05.320
they demonstrated an unhealthy obsession with the worst of YouTube culture,

46:05.320 --> 46:10.320
and his previous arguments about improved mental well-being were beginning to not quite look as sturdy

46:10.320 --> 46:12.320
as they may have seemed at one point.

46:12.320 --> 46:16.320
Many of his own audience were urging him to take a step back, and yet he did not.

46:16.320 --> 46:20.320
In fact, it was quite the contrary.

46:29.320 --> 46:36.320
As said, Nick left the vegan lifestyle behind for the sake of his mental and physical health,

46:36.320 --> 46:39.320
and if a person wants to do that, then it is valid.

46:39.320 --> 46:43.320
However, as we've observed, his non-vegan diet has left a lot to be desired,

46:43.320 --> 46:45.320
the YouTube environment didn't seem to be aiding him,

46:45.320 --> 46:48.320
and only a couple days after his serious allegations video,

46:48.320 --> 46:52.320
he decides to post more content documenting his additional health struggles,

46:52.320 --> 46:54.320
but this time, it was physical.

46:55.320 --> 47:01.320
I was so healthy. I had rice, and beans, and fish, and vegetables,

47:01.320 --> 47:05.320
because I took a day off. The day before that, I had grilled cheese.

47:05.320 --> 47:08.320
Oh my gosh. It's like as if I woke up out of a dream.

47:08.320 --> 47:12.320
In a video called I'm Getting Fat and I Don't Know Why,

47:12.320 --> 47:16.320
he observes that he's getting fat, and doesn't know why.

47:16.320 --> 47:21.320
This is the first real sign of what would probably become a more satirical side of Nick's content,

47:21.320 --> 47:25.320
but maybe people did not recognise that due to their familiarity with his previous work.

47:25.320 --> 47:28.320
However, in this video, he rebuts people by stating that

47:28.320 --> 47:31.320
he thinks that most of his weight has been gained rather suddenly,

47:31.320 --> 47:34.320
and thus not really correlating with his dietary pattern.

47:34.320 --> 47:36.320
For a night, you know, everyone told me,

47:36.320 --> 47:39.320
oh, when you would change your diet, you would get OPs.

47:39.320 --> 47:42.320
I stayed the same for months. It's been three months now.

47:42.320 --> 47:48.320
But it's like all of a sudden, this week, I'm noticing in my face.

47:48.320 --> 47:51.320
However, I can't really say I agree.

47:51.320 --> 47:56.320
I think over the past few months, you can observe some gradual weight gain in the videos in the thumbnails.

47:56.320 --> 47:59.320
A lot of the time, this can be kinda hard to observe as he sat down,

47:59.320 --> 48:03.320
but if you compared a video from early 2017 to late 2016,

48:03.320 --> 48:05.320
then you could probably observe some differences.

48:05.320 --> 48:08.320
Now, if you follow his wardrobe choices such as shirts,

48:08.320 --> 48:12.320
the most rapid change definitely seems somewhat recent at this point,

48:12.320 --> 48:17.320
nothing irreversible, but something about his reflection didn't seem to instil confidence.

48:17.320 --> 48:24.320
I have a fast metabolism. I work out three times a week. I eat plenty of fiber.

48:24.320 --> 48:28.320
Working out three times a week and a fast metabolism isn't going to offset heavy consumption.

48:28.320 --> 48:32.320
It might help you maintain some level of fitness and may slow weight gain,

48:32.320 --> 48:34.320
but it's not going to prevent you from gaining at all.

48:34.320 --> 48:39.320
As a side note, metabolism is not aided by devouring large amounts in one sitting

48:39.320 --> 48:41.320
alongside long intervals between meals.

48:41.320 --> 48:44.320
Now, this doesn't mean that stress cannot contribute to weight gain.

48:44.320 --> 48:47.320
There are plenty of ways that stress can affect one's health,

48:47.320 --> 48:49.320
and I'm more than happy to attest to that,

48:49.320 --> 48:52.320
but Nick must have known it was not the sole contributor,

48:52.320 --> 48:54.320
and that there were other more long-term factors at play.

48:54.320 --> 48:58.320
Nonetheless, he still stood his ground on his mental states.

48:58.320 --> 49:01.320
I feel a lot better mentally.

49:01.320 --> 49:08.320
Like, honestly, this eating more food groups has really, really helped my mental health.

49:08.320 --> 49:10.320
It has helped everything.

49:11.320 --> 49:16.320
But then now, this comes out of nowhere.

49:16.320 --> 49:19.320
In the video, he begs people to tell him what he should do,

49:19.320 --> 49:21.320
before answering his own question.

49:21.320 --> 49:23.320
No, not doing that.

49:23.320 --> 49:29.320
So what's a healthy diet? What do I eat?

49:29.320 --> 49:31.320
I need to get healthier. I'm ready to get healthier.

49:31.320 --> 49:33.320
These muk mums are going to be the death of me.

49:33.320 --> 49:36.320
Next day, he posts another video, this time 20 minutes long,

49:36.320 --> 49:38.320
with the same sort of message.

49:38.320 --> 49:40.320
He's been gaining weight, and he doesn't know what to do.

49:40.320 --> 49:43.320
Next to some other pretty deranged quotes in this video,

49:43.320 --> 49:46.320
he does utter a few rather iconic lines.

49:46.320 --> 49:52.320
That's not the case, because literally, I've been eating that stuff

49:52.320 --> 49:56.320
for like three months straight, and I've looked and weighed the same.

49:56.320 --> 49:58.320
It's just this weight.

49:58.320 --> 50:01.320
I don't know if it's stress levels, because of the thing between me and Orlin.

50:01.320 --> 50:05.320
Maybe this is all water weight.

50:05.320 --> 50:09.320
I'm holding on to water weight, because of my stress.

50:09.320 --> 50:13.320
You know, going to get married, and going back home.

50:13.320 --> 50:17.320
Water weight, which would inevitably become one of his signature memes,

50:17.320 --> 50:22.320
basically this comic scapegoat for his weight gain, and merch you can buy.

50:22.320 --> 50:26.320
So as noted in this series of videos, he observed he needed to make a change.

50:26.320 --> 50:28.320
What was his next move?

50:28.320 --> 50:31.320
Well, to make a bacon, chips, and cheesy pasta mukbang,

50:31.320 --> 50:34.320
but his next video has him going vegan.

50:34.320 --> 50:37.320
Hi, little sloths. Good evening.

50:37.320 --> 50:39.320
I'm coming to you from my house.

50:39.320 --> 50:43.320
You guys, so I decided I'm going to go vegan for today.

50:43.320 --> 50:47.320
Today has been, you know, I have been very strict with my diet lately,

50:47.320 --> 50:51.320
and I decided to just, I do a lot of fun mukbangs, junk food mukbangs,

50:51.320 --> 50:54.320
fried food mukbangs, Cheetos, and everything in between.

50:54.320 --> 50:57.320
But off camera is this.

50:57.320 --> 50:59.320
This is what I eat all the time.

50:59.320 --> 51:00.320
You guys see me on Snapchat.

51:00.320 --> 51:02.320
You guys see all the fruit and all the vegetables,

51:02.320 --> 51:03.320
and I decided to share it with you.

51:03.320 --> 51:05.320
Talk about a bait and switch.

51:05.320 --> 51:08.320
This was then followed by a 10,000 calorie challenge,

51:08.320 --> 51:10.320
more and more mukbangs.

51:10.320 --> 51:12.320
Oh, and a video called Why We Broke Up,

51:12.320 --> 51:16.320
recording the bon vivant time where Nick slept with 12 people

51:16.320 --> 51:18.320
and gave Orlin an STD.

51:18.320 --> 51:21.320
Well, we took a break from each other, and I stayed here in Columbia,

51:21.320 --> 51:23.320
and Nick went on a trip.

51:23.320 --> 51:27.320
Nick went to the US first, and then to London, and then to Asia.

51:27.320 --> 51:31.320
Well, the first thing that you did in Florida was,

51:31.320 --> 51:35.320
he actually cheated on me with someone in Florida

51:35.320 --> 51:38.320
a day or two after you arrived in Florida, right?

51:38.320 --> 51:40.320
Yeah.

51:40.320 --> 51:43.320
Oh, my heart!

51:43.320 --> 51:45.320
You double dipped, and you had a mutual friend.

51:45.320 --> 51:47.320
There was like four or five in DC.

51:47.320 --> 51:48.320
Four or five, yeah.

51:48.320 --> 51:51.320
Drew was like, whoa!

51:51.320 --> 51:52.320
Okay, there was.

51:52.320 --> 51:53.320
Oh, God.

51:54.320 --> 51:57.320
You tried to get two in London, but it didn't work out.

51:57.320 --> 51:58.320
No.

51:58.320 --> 52:00.320
You tried to do one in Pennsylvania, two at our friend's house,

52:00.320 --> 52:01.320
and it also didn't work out.

52:01.320 --> 52:03.320
A friend's house, who's what?

52:03.320 --> 52:04.320
Our friend.

52:04.320 --> 52:09.320
Well, when he came back, he brought me a bug, a little bugger.

52:09.320 --> 52:10.320
Brought a bug.

52:10.320 --> 52:13.320
He brought me a bug.

52:13.320 --> 52:16.320
It wasn't a really bad bug, but it was a bug.

52:16.320 --> 52:17.320
Well, we were afraid.

52:17.320 --> 52:18.320
We were very afraid.

52:18.320 --> 52:19.320
It was a gross bug.

52:19.320 --> 52:22.320
I literally felt, you guys, like my world was coming to an end.

52:22.320 --> 52:28.320
It's one thing to take breaks.

52:28.320 --> 52:30.320
It's one thing to break up.

52:30.320 --> 52:31.320
It's one thing to test waters.

52:31.320 --> 52:34.320
It's one thing to have affairs, but it's another thing to get a bug.

52:34.320 --> 52:35.320
Oh, yeah?

52:35.320 --> 52:38.320
That could possibly end your life early.

52:38.320 --> 52:47.320
And for me to think about giving that to you was terrible.

52:47.320 --> 52:50.320
This happened around 10 months ago, and they both claim they've moved on,

52:50.320 --> 52:55.320
but it's certainly a strange upload, which many found wasn't the most flattering to Nick's image,

52:55.320 --> 53:00.320
especially considering the claim that All In is believed to be suffering from an autoimmune illness.

53:00.320 --> 53:04.320
This pattern of mukbangs interspersed with more personal videos persisted,

53:04.320 --> 53:08.320
including two where he has a swollen eye, and is too afraid to go to hospital.

53:08.320 --> 53:14.320
Doctors, and just to set the grounds of how intense my phobia is,

53:14.320 --> 53:17.320
just getting my blood pressure taken, I always go unconscious.

53:17.320 --> 53:20.320
I pass out, and it almost looks like a seizure.

53:20.320 --> 53:21.320
I start shaking.

53:21.320 --> 53:22.320
It's a phobia.

53:22.320 --> 53:26.320
I was diagnosed when I was a child, and it's not just blood pressure.

53:26.320 --> 53:31.320
It's like when I get my hair cut, anything with knives or sharp things,

53:31.320 --> 53:34.320
that's one reason that I shouldn't really be doing much kitchen stuff,

53:34.320 --> 53:37.320
but especially like shots, IVs.

53:37.320 --> 53:38.320
Oh, my gosh.

53:38.320 --> 53:40.320
I remember one time I had to get an IV, a blood drawn,

53:40.320 --> 53:44.320
and I passed out twice, twice before they could even do it,

53:44.320 --> 53:47.320
and I broke the lady's chair at the clinic in Washington DC.

53:47.320 --> 53:50.320
Spoiler alert, he ends up going to the hospital,

53:50.320 --> 53:54.320
and also went to the hospital a couple months later after his pet sloth bit his finger.

53:54.320 --> 53:58.320
There's a few more awkward videos, it's just far too much on show,

53:58.320 --> 54:00.320
and ultimately, it does him more harm than good.

54:00.320 --> 54:04.320
He'll go from crying copiously about a horrible day in one video,

54:04.320 --> 54:07.320
to rocking on up to the heart attack grill with hungry fat chick,

54:07.320 --> 54:10.320
and getting free food because she's over 350 pounds,

54:10.320 --> 54:13.320
not long after voicing weight concerns,

54:13.320 --> 54:15.320
and it doesn't get better.

54:22.320 --> 54:24.320
It's just a bit late for that, mate.

54:24.320 --> 54:28.320
At this point, it should be clear that what was once this reason persona

54:28.320 --> 54:32.320
attempting to articulate why he had distanced himself from a toxic community

54:32.320 --> 54:34.320
had augmented into this caricature.

54:34.320 --> 54:37.320
He can no longer really justify his previous position,

54:37.320 --> 54:41.320
so whatever reason behind it just threw it out the window completely,

54:41.320 --> 54:44.320
and turned it into a form of entertainment,

54:44.320 --> 54:47.320
and the behaviour only descended further from here.

54:47.320 --> 54:51.320
Now, the purpose of this video isn't going to be focusing on his weight,

54:51.320 --> 54:55.320
as I feel like his weight gain is more a side effect of his behaviour.

54:55.320 --> 54:58.320
As noted, someone can be the way they want to be,

54:58.320 --> 55:02.320
but when they're in a state of denial, not just with this, but with many other things,

55:02.320 --> 55:04.320
and they project those narratives to their audience,

55:04.320 --> 55:07.320
it's not constructive to themselves or those around them,

55:07.320 --> 55:09.320
even if they may see it as a lampoon.

55:09.320 --> 55:11.320
It's about the content.

55:11.320 --> 55:15.320
This stuff played up ridiculously in the moment to carry a much more dramatic heft

55:15.320 --> 55:19.320
than it has any right to, and being forgotten by the next video.

55:19.320 --> 55:21.320
This is the epitome of drama.

55:21.320 --> 55:23.320
It was hard to watch, and because of Nick's approach,

55:23.320 --> 55:28.320
it ultimately diminished the impact of said videos to all but the most ardent supporters.

55:28.320 --> 55:33.320
If the drama itself wasn't hugely exaggerated, it was often precipitated by his own actions,

55:33.320 --> 55:36.320
such as the deportation video, a sad situation,

55:36.320 --> 55:40.320
but he provoked the problem by overstaying his tourist visa by 70 days,

55:40.320 --> 55:44.320
so we need to have multiple videos of him just bawling his eyes out

55:44.320 --> 55:48.320
and making statements that are just plain daft, and here are a few.

55:48.320 --> 55:51.320
My husband, and this is my family, this is my apartment,

55:51.320 --> 55:54.320
these are my belongings, this is my table.

55:54.320 --> 55:57.320
I'll tell you, you're not going to see Mr. Noodle ever again,

55:57.320 --> 55:59.320
you're not going to see Orlan ever again.

56:02.320 --> 56:03.320
So what?

56:04.320 --> 56:06.320
Who cares?

56:06.320 --> 56:07.320
Do you care?

56:10.320 --> 56:11.320
A grocery store.

56:11.320 --> 56:13.320
We're on our way to the airport.

56:13.320 --> 56:15.320
What do you think I'm hiding right now?

56:16.320 --> 56:18.320
So that was a fun ride.

56:18.320 --> 56:22.320
And when I use a Tyler the Creator clip, you know I'm at the end of my tether.

56:22.320 --> 56:26.320
The truth is, with this content, one thing they all had in common

56:26.320 --> 56:30.320
is that they were designed to provoke, and provoke they often did.

56:31.320 --> 56:36.320
There was one more piece, the portrait of Nikocado Avocado.

56:54.320 --> 56:56.320
2018 is beginning.

56:56.320 --> 57:00.320
Nikocado Avocado is deep into his regression.

57:00.320 --> 57:03.320
I could detail every instant he covers in his videos,

57:03.320 --> 57:08.320
but as noted, the commodification of this content rendered most of the drama redundant,

57:08.320 --> 57:12.320
so I'm just going to throw out a brief compilation of some nice highlights.

57:16.320 --> 57:18.320
There's some youtubes out there that every time I go to their videos

57:18.320 --> 57:24.320
they just cover with such cruelty, such cruelty by other human beings.

57:24.320 --> 57:26.320
Don't you realize that's a real person behind the camera

57:26.320 --> 57:28.320
trying their hardest every day to make you happy?

57:28.320 --> 57:32.320
He passed out on the floor, and we're waiting for you guys to know

57:32.320 --> 57:35.320
that he's going to go get a rabies vaccine.

57:35.320 --> 57:41.320
Oh, my head hurts so bad. I feel like I'm being everywhere.

57:41.320 --> 57:44.320
It's so uncomfortable. It hurts to just be alive.

57:46.320 --> 57:49.320
The possibility is that I have pre-diabetes.

57:49.320 --> 57:51.320
I'm pre-diabetic or I have diabetes.

57:51.320 --> 57:56.320
I have hypertension. I could have high blood pressure.

57:56.320 --> 57:58.320
I don't know. I don't know.

58:09.320 --> 58:13.320
I'm not crazy. I swear. I'm not crazy. It's just so beautiful.

58:15.320 --> 58:18.320
Essentially, I am being forced to leave.

58:18.320 --> 58:20.320
The 25th is when my visa expires.

58:24.320 --> 58:28.320
I want to apologize for offending anybody when I made the statement,

58:28.320 --> 58:29.320
I hate the third world.

58:31.320 --> 58:34.320
I just, I need someone to talk to.

58:38.320 --> 58:40.320
Remember back in, what was it, March, the police framed me.

58:40.320 --> 58:43.320
They put bullets in my suitcase. I was bribed by the government.

58:43.320 --> 58:46.320
I almost got stabbed in Las Vegas.

58:49.320 --> 58:54.320
I'm proud of hate. I got on my video with Orlin.

58:54.320 --> 59:01.320
The volcano fire noodles is just unacceptable.

59:02.320 --> 59:04.320
It's just one thing after another with me.

59:04.320 --> 59:09.320
I'm leaving to get deported and we're having Domino's pizza.

59:12.320 --> 59:14.320
So kind.

59:15.320 --> 59:21.320
I'm telling you, I miss him so much. I really miss him.

59:25.320 --> 59:28.320
And now I'm married to that person.

59:31.320 --> 59:37.320
This content was embarrassing to watch, and probably even more uncomfortable if you had the displeasure of being associated with it.

59:37.320 --> 59:42.320
It ultimately culminates in a series of videos where Orlin allegedly breaks up with Nick over Instagram.

59:42.320 --> 59:46.320
This causes Nick to upload multiple emotional Instagram posts and go full Joker mode on his channel.

59:46.320 --> 59:51.320
Can I just say, I am not having it today.

59:51.320 --> 59:53.320
I am not having it today.

59:53.320 --> 01:00:01.320
Today, Missy Two Shoes, you people on my Instagram, first of all, it is a privilege.

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:06.320
P-R-I-V-E-L-E-G. Privilege to be there.

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:09.320
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:15.320
This persisted over the following year with many new developments, including break ups, new dates, Nick dragging Orlin's reputation,

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.320
and then trying to rescue it himself.

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:24.320
Now, as bizarre as this turn of events is, it's completely in line with the behaviour observed, so I don't really have too much to add here.

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:28.320
He exploits previous situations, focuses in on the negative, acts over emotional,

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:31.320
contradicts himself massively in the space of a couple videos.

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:37.320
These are all behaviours we've covered, no, in this part we're going to analyse a new fast at the surface later on,

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.320
but to do that, I need to set the scene.

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:45.320
It's 2018, Mukbang content is in full swing, Nick had been experiencing constant growth,

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:51.320
however, it's likely that with the degree of drama he immersed himself in, he had considerable audience turnover.

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:54.320
By 2019, that was going to change.

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:58.320
What do I mean? Nick has been a drama queen for the majority of his YouTube career,

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:04.320
but when Nick created drama within his own personal life, it only typically had negative implications for himself,

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:09.320
and perhaps Orlin. He may have gained a bit of attention here and there, but many viewers objected to this content.

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:15.320
In fact, even when the drama was about other people, there was very little to gain because there was no solid community

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.320
to rally behind the creator.

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:22.320
Nick hadn't been involved in any serious creator squabbles, but he definitely exhibited the potential to be.

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:27.320
The first prerequisite for such an instigatorary personality is the ability to be dramatic.

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:30.320
Now, we all know that Nick has that in spades.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:36.320
The second prerequisite is the ability to call out people, people who often you may have a pre-existing relationship with.

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:42.320
For this, I want to briefly take you back to 2017, where Nick made a video called

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:46.320
I'm Fed Up Exposing Fake Mean YouTubers.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:52.320
I have so much proof on my phone, she knows exactly who she is, and the other one,

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.320
I'm not even gonna talk about this, I'm not gonna give her attention, I don't wanna give any of them attention.

01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:01.320
I have had it up to here, though. She's so disgusting. Girl, no.

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:07.320
So she can't return my emails, she can't return my snaps, she can't return my Twitter, she can't return my Instagram,

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:13.320
she can't even, like, have a conversation with me for months and months and months and months and months and months and months,

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:18.320
but she has the time, five minutes after my video gets published, to advertise herself,

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:24.320
everyone look at my clothes, everyone look at my new boyfriend, everyone, just now, get lost.

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:31.320
This video is a rather passionate rant towards an unspecified individual that many assume to be another creator by the name of Trisha Paytas.

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:35.320
Now, Trisha Paytas is an exceptionally controversial character by her own right,

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:39.320
and therefore, it's likely that many may have shared negative experiences with her,

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:45.320
but Nick doesn't explicitly name her, and this video ends up being a rather minor entry into his exhaustive catalogue.

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:50.320
So this leads us to the third and final prerequisite, the ability to name them.

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:58.320
Now, Nick hadn't made any explicit exposes on people, so creators who work with him in the near future could be forgiven in their ignorance,

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:03.320
but if you had been paying attention in 2018, you would have perhaps spotted a combative streak.

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:08.320
She wasn't looking for recognition, she's not looking for a shoutout on like divine munchies,

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:16.320
not looking for clouds and subscribers and everyone to be like, she just wasn't asking to use me or to be on my channel,

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.320
she just was receptive to help me.

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:27.320
And no, it's so funny, divine munchies pretends that she's like, hello, my friends, we are here on the earth,

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:34.320
I don't eat animals, and you shouldn't either, even though I ate it five months, you know, for a couple months to make money and get suns,

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:39.320
but no, no, no, now I'll tell you why, I am transparent, I am genuine.

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:43.320
The people that act like that are usually the complete opposite.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:48.320
This was a clip from his two hour extravaganza with Asian KFC,

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:51.320
where he reveals that someone in the community is being rather fake.

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:55.320
This person was a creator by the name of StarsDivineMunchies.

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:11.320
StarsDivineMunchies was another mukbang creator, in 2018, she became one of the first recipients of Nick's new taste for drama.

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:17.320
Clearly tired by all the conflict in his personal life, he decided to drum up some new complaints about this individual.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:22.320
Now, StarsDivineMunchies was not a completely unproblematic creator by mukbang standards,

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:26.320
however, in a now deleted response video only documented by a few other creators,

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:29.320
she seemed quite concise in how she felt about Nick.

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:35.320
We will now observe parts of this video through the perspective of the legendary creator HowToCameron.

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:43.320
I was never trying to share anything that you hadn't already shared to hundreds of thousands of people online.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:52.320
So it wasn't like I was sharing some secret information, I was literally sharing what you had posted about on Twitter,

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:55.320
what you had shared in your mukbang videos.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:03.320
I thought your YouTube manager was the one who told you that mukbang videos were getting demonetized.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:10.320
So why would I think me sharing this with them would reflect bad on you?

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:14.320
Now you're trying to talk to me now, buttering me up, trying to talk to me.

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:18.320
I wasn't trying to talk to you or butter you up trying to talk to you.

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:23.320
This situation was provoked because Nick had tweeted concerns about mukbang content being demonetized,

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:28.320
and Divine Munchies had disparaged this claim after consulting another YouTube representative.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:33.320
It then led to a rather confusing situation where Divine Munchies alleges that Nick proposed a collab,

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:38.320
but she had to decline last minute because she was ill, which is what led Nick to making a video alleging

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:42.320
that she was the person who proposed the collab, and talking various amounts of smack as well,

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:47.320
including the rather strong claim that Divine Munchies was attempting to have Nick's channel removed.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:54.320
And Divine Munchies, that's her character, which I've been trying to point out for a long time,

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:59.320
and all that other shit, these are their characters.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:03.320
Divine Munchies made a response to clear up Nick's alleged disinformation,

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:06.320
and as observed, to present her version of events.

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:12.320
Nick didn't take this well, and decided to make some additional, rather angry Instagram posts about her.

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:17.320
Now if you go to her video, I have this thing which is like an analytical thing.

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:20.320
These are the tags that she used.

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:23.320
Nikocado Avocado Fat.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:31.320
In this video, she paints the stage from the get-go as I don't have any ill things to say about him,

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:36.320
I'm not going to name call him, I would never do what he did and call me names, you know,

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:39.320
passive aggressive stuff, being manipulative.

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:45.320
Because, I don't know if you know, but as a YouTuber, you get to link your video to key, you know, searches.

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:51.320
She's trying to get view rate and clicks off of me based on people attacking my weight,

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:54.320
people that have looked up Nikocado Fat videos that are hateful.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:59.320
She'll turn on the camera and be like, oh yeah, I don't mean to call anyone names, I would never stoop down to his level,

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:01.320
oh I don't know why he would say such a thing.

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:04.320
It's like, because I know how you are, bitch, I know how you are.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:09.320
You're going to come across on camera and be one way, but then go off camera and write out Nikocado's fat.

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:14.320
Now I'd say this would be a valid counterpoint if she'd actively typed out the tags herself,

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:20.320
but in the Instagram post, you can see the fat tag is amongst many other related tags that don't entirely connect with the video,

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:25.320
and although perhaps moderately distasteful, it probably means she just mass added a load of tags,

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:30.320
perhaps using a similar program to the one you're showing tags on, because many of them have that feature.

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:35.320
However, as we'll find out, Nik is quite interested in video tags.

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:50.320
He also says this, which I found confusing, because he was the one who brought it up in the video,

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:54.320
and although you could say that Divine making a response video in the first place was an overreaction,

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:59.320
you can't act surprised that part of her response is responding to what you said.

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:03.320
Now these are only fragments of the drama, there was other content too which is untraceable,

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:06.320
so it's hard to take too many character inferences.

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:11.320
What it does tell us is that Nik was gradually immersing himself in more drama and call out culture

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:15.320
as he became more involved in the community, and he certainly wasn't afraid to throw some shade.

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:21.320
But throwing shade was one thing, and he was ready to step it up a whole new level.

01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:24.320
But before we go into that, I wanted to say a quick side note.

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:29.320
Where the hell is his nipple? Another question that will never be answered.

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:34.320
It's quite clear that Nik is an inherently dramatic person,

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:39.320
but drama only really exists on a continual basis in communities where such a culture is supported.

01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:41.320
Mukbang is one of those cultures.

01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:53.320
Why is that? Well firstly because it coasts on a more intimate personal basis, rather than core creativity.

01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:56.320
This doesn't mean that Mukbangs can't be creative, many of them are,

01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:01.320
but Mukbang content will always include the subject of the video interacting with the audience on a personal basis,

01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:05.320
talking about their week, and if their week involves some other person being a twat,

01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:10.320
then they may well wish to tell you about that person, especially if it means spicy tea.

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:14.320
Secondly, because many audiences of such creators seem highly receptive to drama.

01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:18.320
The beauty community, for example, is another community fairly renowned for its high-stakes scandal,

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:21.320
and it has many creators who occasionally partake in Mukbangs,

01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:25.320
leading to audience overlap in the more dedicated Mukbang community.

01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:30.320
This also means commentary overlap, and it wouldn't surprise you to see various YouTube compilation channels

01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:34.320
set up to mock and parody the worst moments of Mukbang creators,

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:37.320
much akin to the corresponding beauty community compilation channels.

01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:40.320
Which conveniently segues us to our next situation.

01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:46.320
Here's a fun little question, how do you make someone with very little credibility seem credible?

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:50.320
It's a difficult job, and Nikocado Avocado had his work cut out.

01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:55.320
This dude had rolled his reputation through the mud at this point, like a Mukbang mux.

01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:03.320
However, there is a rather simple answer, find someone with even less credibility, and get to work.

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:14.320
Let's introduce someone by the name of Veronica Wang then.

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:19.320
Veronica Wang is also a Mukbang creator, she, like many Mukbang creators, enjoys a good meal,

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:24.320
but has a bit of a habit of focusing on the negative. In this instance, the negative encompassed compilations

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:29.320
made by a channel called Shookbang. This content has also mostly been removed from the internet,

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:33.320
though it was documented fairly comprehensively in a video by Spill.

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:48.320
I think that's more passive aggressive than appreciative to be honest.

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:53.320
But that aside, after a couple videos, Veronica uploaded her own parody compilation,

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:57.320
whose undertone conveyed one of hurt at people who were making these.

01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:02.320
After not receiving the desired response, she decided to copyright strike two of Shookbang's videos.

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:06.320
Shookbang responded by uploading an exposé on Veronica, which is where Nick comes in.

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:12.320
He leaves the comments criticizing Veronica's behaviour. All in all, it seems relatively empathetic to Shookbang's

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:16.320
predicaments. Veronica continues to dig herself a hole with rather weak statements,

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:23.320
and then another channel, Sass ASMR, decides to deal with an additional copyright strike on Shookbang's channel.

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:26.320
This meant that Shookbang had three strikes and was set for termination.

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:32.320
Enter unlikely hero, Nikocado Avocado, who Shookbang contacted with their plights.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:37.320
Following multiple email exchanges, Nick decided to make a video of his own discussing the situation

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:41.320
on his Nikocado Avocado 2 channel, the channel which used to be All In's.

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:46.320
Hi guys, it's Nikocado Avocado, welcome to my new Mukbang channel, Nikocado 2, you're on it,

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:50.320
consider subscribing if you haven't done so, but it doesn't matter, cause today we have a lot to talk about.

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:56.320
I woke up to some juicy tea, oh my gosh, I even got a tea for the thumbnail, yes I did.

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.320
Nick, edit that out, no one wants to see that.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:07.320
This is a 40 minute video, but once again, it's not entirely unreasonable.

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:12.320
He stands up for Shookbang and discusses fair use, though he does assert the somewhat inaccurate narrative

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:15.320
that Veronica's copyright claims were quote, basically illegal.

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:20.320
So this is the issue, another Mukbanger took her clip and reacted to it, changed it around,

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:23.320
made his own little story out of it in a very nice way.

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:30.320
She flagged it as copyright, which was a lie, which is illegal basically, it's basically illegal,

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:33.320
I mean let's just be real here, and you can't say that it infringes your rights,

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:36.320
when in actuality, it falls under the fair use law.

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:43.320
She used that copyright complaint system as grounds to strike down a channel that she just agreed with

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.320
on the premise of a lie.

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:49.320
The claims themselves may not be valid, and Veronica's motives were twisted

01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:52.320
given the cyberbullying narrative, that's not copyright.

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:56.320
But unless someone submits a claim on a video that they know is fair use,

01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:58.320
then it would be hard to prove illegality.

01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:01.320
Particularly with these compilations, it is very unclear.

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:05.320
In my opinion, it is quite possible that Veronica became upset about these videos

01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:07.320
and wanted to find a valid excuse to remove them.

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:12.320
It may be childish, but as long as she thought it was copyright infringement, then it's not illegal.

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:17.320
Someone could initiate a lawsuit against another person because of some deeply rooted personal grudge,

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:19.320
which has nothing to do with the legal system,

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:23.320
but there could still be legal grounds for wrongdoing on the other person's behalf.

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:27.320
However, I will say that Nick's points on this seem more reactive than manipulative.

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:31.320
Nick also eats a lot of noodles, which kind of interrupts the flow of the narrative,

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:34.320
but ho-hum, I'll take it over crying and eating pizza.

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:37.320
However, not too long after, Veronica flies off the handle,

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:41.320
publishing a rather unhinged Instagram rant, attacking Shookbang, audiences,

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:45.320
and anyone making commentary on the situation, Nick being no exception.

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:48.320
I do not regret copyright striking those videos.

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.320
I do not regret standing up for myself,

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:56.320
and I will not address anybody who is making titles about me from here on out for views,

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:59.320
because they're shady, they're liars,

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:05.320
and they're painting me to be this horrible person when I do nothing except spread love every single day of my life.

01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:11.320
Everyone else can honestly, seriously, and I'm saying this wholeheartedly, can go f**k themselves.

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:13.320
I do not give a s**t, man.

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:16.320
Like, you're gonna try to twist my s**t around?

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:18.320
I have been nothing but loving and caring.

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:22.320
This was enough for Nick to upload two more videos, reinforcing his stance,

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:25.320
and there are a few other details here, but they are mostly superfluous to the focus.

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:29.320
Okay, it is a little bit crowded here, everyone out of the way, back to the topic.

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:34.320
At some point, Shookbang, Veronica, and Sass came to an out of YouTube settlement,

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.320
and the copyright strikes were removed,

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:40.320
but many, Nick included, felt that Shookbang took a far too apologetic position,

01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:45.320
and that the main instigators in this situation did not face nearly enough consequences.

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:49.320
This is where Nick becomes more involved following a video uploaded by PewDiePie.

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:54.320
Veronica seemed to take the criticism well, which offended Nick as he felt he had delivered similar criticism.

01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:57.320
There are multiple details regarding the resolution of this situation,

01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:00.320
but they are mostly relating to Shookbang and fair use discourse,

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:03.320
which is fascinating, but not the focus of today.

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:07.320
So we'll cut to the video that Veronica uploads, and it's another bad one.

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:12.320
I think the first thing that I need to do for my subscribers, but not just my subscribers,

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:17.320
because recently, someone told me that this is the thing about being an influencer.

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:22.320
It's not about apologizing to that person, it's not about apologizing about the situation,

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:24.320
it's about directly apologizing to everyone.

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:29.320
After I was told this, I realized how wrong I was, and that I do owe everyone an apology.

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:33.320
So I want to make it very clear now that I am so sorry to everyone,

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:36.320
I am so sorry to Shookbang that they got their channel taken down,

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:40.320
I am so sorry that I even made a copyright strike to begin with.

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:46.320
I am so sorry, I made a huge mistake, I've made a bunch of mistakes in this situation.

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:50.320
Great, now we have a decent apology in the first two minutes out of the way,

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:53.320
we still have 25 minutes left, what else is there to say?

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:55.320
Did she cut the tea kettle?

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:56.320
Yeah, of course!

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:04.320
Okay, wait, wait, wait, I love how he chalks that up too, like, oh my god.

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:06.320
Is he always trying to make her look crazy?

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:09.320
You can really hold on to this, you can tell that this was affecting her,

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:11.320
because people were really attacking you.

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:14.320
You were very, like, how can you say, like, after seeing her live,

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:19.320
yeah, I don't believe what she's saying, this is fake, like, what are you talking about?

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:26.320
It's kind of funny, like, how he chalks it up, because it makes you look certified, like, now.

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.320
I know!

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:35.320
Her sitting down with her friends, going after Nick in such a disorganised way,

01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:37.320
was an exceptionally strange response,

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:40.320
because not only does it provide the impression of unnecessary dog-piling,

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:44.320
it's lack of structure undermines whatever weight it may carry,

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.320
or additional evidence it may have to offer,

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:51.320
and it wasn't like there was nothing there, it was just a barren wasteland to find it,

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:56.320
and this allowed Nick to move in fairly clinically, providing a cohesive wall of rhetoric.

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:59.320
And yes, I put her most dramatic parts in the beginning of my videos,

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:03.320
instead of focusing on the premise, instead of focusing on the principle,

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:06.320
instead of backing up her statements with evidence,

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:09.320
instead of showing us how she lied or did not lie,

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:11.320
instead of apologising to everybody.

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:14.320
Now this is word porn for the verbose commentator,

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:16.320
but what was really behind that language?

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:33.320
One thing that seems quite clear is that Nick is not lacking in intelligence,

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:36.320
his responses were well-formulated and maintained a consistent narrative.

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:39.320
Veronica, on the other hand, decided to make a call-out video,

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:44.320
primarily aimed at Nikocado Avocado and marketed it as an apology video,

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:49.320
which is such a terrible idea that everyone just assumed she'd learned absolutely nothing from the entire situation.

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:55.320
Here's a scenario that caused a lot of upset, and she's just cavorting with her mates like a legitimate sociopath.

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:03.320
Make no mistake, Nick deconstructed her on many fronts,

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:06.320
however there were a few details which I found rather curious.

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:10.320
Nick frames this video as an extensive direct response to everything Veronica says about him,

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:13.320
and mostly he does a good job of responding,

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:16.320
but one of the details he purposely cuts out is this whole screenshot,

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:21.320
which he would have undoubtedly encountered while responding to Veronica's counter-allegations.

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:24.320
It only appears when Veronica cuts it over herself talking.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:28.320
And so he has just done so much that he is claiming that I am,

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:33.320
that he is completely guilty of all these things, consistent with his channel.

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:38.320
Excuse me, if we're going to speak about relative consistency, let's look at my past few years on YouTube.

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:42.320
Have I ever made a video like the one I made to you? No.

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:45.320
My consistency has been crying and eating. That's it.

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:53.320
This doesn't define my character, and it's very sad that someone who is like this feels like they need to portray who they are onto other people.

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:58.320
I did not talk about myself at all in any of my videos. How did I portray myself?

01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:02.320
I'll take a quick moment to say that Nick manages to misinterpret Veronica's point,

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:07.320
stating that he hadn't talked about himself in his videos, but with the corresponding evidence,

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:13.320
Veronica's claim was clearly that Nick was projecting cynical character judgements based on his own actions,

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:16.320
not necessarily that he was talking about himself.

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:19.320
What were these actions? Well, let's talk about this picture.

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:23.320
This screenshot is from a gentleman by the name of Rainy Pachac.

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:27.320
Rainy Pachac, known as Symbiotic Solutions on YouTube, is a raw food vegan creator.

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:31.320
He knew Nick from when he was in the community, and didn't have the best experience with him.

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:35.320
In fact, some old posts paid clear testament to his feelings about Nick.

01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:39.320
However, one of the interesting facts about their relationship is that at a certain point,

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:45.320
Nick copyright-striked one of Rainy's videos using a fake account, which he later admitted to be himself.

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:50.320
Now, this was a long time ago, and although completely hypocritical from a behavioural standpoint,

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:55.320
it's understandable that people can change, and Nick's narrative wasn't that she should be permanently ruined,

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:59.320
it was just that she should apologise, something that it seems Nick has done.

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:04.320
So why is this of interest? Well, because of the simple fact he glossed over it.

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:09.320
Which, given that he was desperately asking for some semblance of receipts, seems somewhat surprising.

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:12.320
Why did he dodge it? Well, he probably didn't want to address it,

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:16.320
but his own narrative preached forgiveness and owning up so we can all move forward.

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:20.320
If he admitted that he's made mistakes elsewhere, and then turned this point on its head

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:25.320
for why Veronica should own up to her mistakes, then it could have made his video even more effective.

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:29.320
I have a hunch for why he dodged it, but that will be revealed in due time.

01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:34.320
Truth is, a lot of people didn't notice because Veronica's response was such a dumpster fire,

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:38.320
and more people actually watched Nick's response to Veronica than the original video.

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:44.320
Now, he does briefly mention the general notion of people dredging up his past, questioning their intent and validity,

01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:48.320
but it ultimately feels slightly disingenuous given the specific example shown on screen,

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:51.320
and how it could on principle contradict his position.

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:57.320
Instead, Nick uses the fact that he's not going to descend into such mudslinging as a way to pedestal his stance,

01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:02.320
before launching multiple ad hominems against the community that this person's complaint is from.

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:06.320
Why are you going to sit here and claim that I depicted you in a bad light,

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:09.320
that I'm attacking and bullying and slandering you,

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:14.320
when you're sitting here and entertaining all of these claims from people of the past?

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:20.320
He has just done so much that he is claiming that I am, that he is completely guilty of all these things.

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:23.320
All of these claims from people of the past.

01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:25.320
Who are crawling up from the floorboards and saying,

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:28.320
Oh, Nikocado did this to me in the past.

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:30.320
Nikocado did this in the past.

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:31.320
And you're going to say, oh.

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:32.320
No!

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:36.320
Well, it must be true. Let me just stick it into my video. My apology.

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:39.320
I have gotten many emails about you.

01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:45.320
I have had people reach out to me who have personally been affected and traumatized by what you've done to them.

01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:47.320
Should I let the world know what you've done in your past?

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:52.320
Should I sit here and entertain all of these accusations from five years ago, ten years ago?

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:53.320
I didn't do that.

01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.320
You want to sit here and say that I bullied and slandered you?

01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:57.320
My videos were talking about the present.

01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:59.320
I backed up my statements with evidence.

01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:03.320
You making a video apologizing by bringing up all of these old conflicts,

01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:08.320
which you have no idea what they entail, is what actual slander is.

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.320
Because you can't verify if they're true.

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:14.320
I'm not going to go into all of my past problems, just like I didn't go into all your past problems.

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:18.320
But I will just say for the record, some of these people reached out to you literally half a decade ago.

01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:24.320
2013, 2014, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, literally over half a decade ago.

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:30.320
When I was a raw food vegan, I was blasted at all of these raw food groups.

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.320
I mean, you clearly don't watch me.

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:35.320
I have so many story times about how Orlin and I met in a cult.

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:36.320
Okay?

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:38.320
Cooking food denatures the food.

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:40.320
Cooking food is poison.

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.320
Dietary leukodygenesis.

01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:47.320
A group of people who thought, if you cook your food, you are setting bad examples to society.

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:51.320
These people have had it out to get me ever since I stopped being vegan.

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:54.320
Since I eat dead animals now, I am seen as a murderer.

01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:56.320
I am seen as having no compassion.

01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:59.320
I am seen as unethical because I eat chicken.

01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:03.320
Some of these people are taking it to the extreme because I cooked my food.

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:07.320
Not only can you not verify if those are true and accurate,

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:11.320
not only can you not verify if these people are just holding grudges against me,

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:14.320
but you're entertaining something you know nothing about.

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:17.320
You have no idea who you're speaking to.

01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:25.320
You have no idea the type of intensity behind these people and their mission and their views.

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:32.320
And I guarantee, had you not had this problem with me, they would also see you as a murderer because you eat meat.

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:35.320
People are seeing this as an opportunity to make it about themselves

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:40.320
and to make it about past situations from years ago that has nothing to do with anything.

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:43.320
And you're entertaining that, and sticking it in your apology.

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:49.320
Side note, Nick tends to wrap his justifications in the Quoque fallacy a lot,

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:52.320
that I'll informally call the No You argument.

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:56.320
Veronica's claims are pretty baseless, so Nick looks fairly assured in his takedown,

01:23:56.320 --> 01:24:00.320
but by logic and argumentation standards, it's not the best.

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:04.320
On top of this, Veronica Wang also includes content from Divine Munchies,

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:07.320
who brings up the specific point about Nick promoting the need for evidence,

01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:11.320
and yet gleefully claiming she was trying to take his channel down with no evidence of his own,

01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:15.320
it's also important to mention that he made that allegation less than a year before.

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:19.320
Nick, once again, doesn't show this or mention it at all.

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:21.320
He still did decimate Veronica Wang's arguments,

01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:26.320
but for someone who conveys a message of such sincerity, these omissions seem rather calculated.

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:31.320
He had no problem being meticulous in going through the details when dealing with Veronica's issue,

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:35.320
but also had no problem making general and frankly somewhat inaccurate statements

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:37.320
about people who Veronica referenced in her video,

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:41.320
as well as saying that Veronica could not prove what those people were saying to be true,

01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:43.320
which, honestly, she could have.

01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:47.320
Now, Veronica didn't prove it because she's not very good at these sorts of videos,

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:50.320
but it wouldn't have been too much hassle to obtain verification,

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:54.320
especially the one where Nick literally has it in an upload on his own channel.

01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:58.320
On top of this, Nick also left out any screenshots rebutting his points about legality,

01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:01.320
although he does respond to it partly in the video.

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.320
Veronica's arguments were pretty weak on this front anyway,

01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:07.320
and it didn't help that one of her friends suggested that US law didn't apply to them,

01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:09.320
which Nick had a field day with,

01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:13.320
before going on to claim that Veronica said it herself towards the end of the video.

01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:14.320
Sneaky sneaky.

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:19.320
And if you were so smart, you would know that we live in Canada.

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:22.320
Like, US law doesn't apply to us, and it's different.

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:25.320
And that's not excusing Veronica just because she's Canadian or whatever,

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:29.320
because I know, like, Niko Kai, you're going to try and clock me for that.

01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:34.320
But at the same, like, it's just that, like, you're talking out of your ass.

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:38.320
And if you were so smart, too.

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:40.320
So smart.

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:43.320
Or took the time to Google, rather than sitting here and enabling your friend,

01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:47.320
your pal, you would also know that when you work for a company overseas,

01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:50.320
you adhere to the laws of the country's origin.

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:52.320
I mean, I've traveled internationally a lot.

01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:54.320
When in Rome, you act as the Romans.

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:56.320
I'm not claiming to be a lawyer.

01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:03.320
Now, the only person who's claiming to have legal counsel from an attorney is Veronica.

01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:06.320
Her legal advisor didn't tell her this.

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:11.320
When and where has she shown through her actions that she has owned up to anything?

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:15.320
That the U.S. law doesn't apply to her because she's Canadian.

01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:19.320
There is no way that you would have removed the strike had I not brought light to it.

01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:24.320
That you would have removed your strike had PewDiePie not exposed you to seven million people.

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:28.320
There is no way, because you still said U.S. law doesn't apply to you.

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:33.320
Veronica's ostensible approval of her friend's comments is part of her undoing here.

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:37.320
As Nik shows, if you don't have a good response, maybe best not to respond at all.

01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.320
I never forced this person to do anything.

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:42.320
I told them if they were uncomfortable, they didn't have to do it.

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:46.320
I understand that the other YouTuber sass asked for an apology.

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:48.320
I even said that this person didn't have to apologize.

01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:53.320
All I wanted was the facts written out, and that's it, for us to move on.

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:56.320
There were a few times where Nik seems to avoid responses and corrections,

01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:02.320
such as Veronica's fully evidenced responses to the claim that she forced Shookban to apologize,

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:06.320
something that Nik doesn't address, despite it being part of those receipts he begged for.

01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:13.320
One consistent narrative that Nik has always had is tearing people down to bring himself back up.

01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:19.320
Instead of showing us receipts, you know, to back up your statements, to add validity to your words.

01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:23.320
You did it real quick over here. Congrats getting into your college.

01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:25.320
That took, what, two seconds? Screenshot, boom.

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:28.320
Why didn't you show us the receipts for the police report?

01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:30.320
The receipts for your death threats.

01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:32.320
Where are those receipts of the emails?

01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:39.320
Supposedly, as you quoted, every mukbanger emailed you privately behind closed doors to say they were in support of you.

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.320
Let's see those receipts.

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.320
The receipts of your lawyer.

01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:44.320
The receipts from SAS ASMR.

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:48.320
The receipts of the fair use law, which you still believe you did not break.

01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:52.320
The receipts of your private messages with Shookbang, which I happen to have.

01:27:52.320 --> 01:28:00.320
Instead of doing any of this, showing us evidence, she decided to use this as an opportunity to assassinate my character.

01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:07.320
And yet because Nik's so confident, it easily offsets any counterpoints that can be brought against him.

01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:13.320
It also conveys the message that you don't necessarily need the best points if you have the power of conviction,

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:18.320
a lesson that would turn out to be rather prophetic in more than one way.

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:22.320
This is a basic rundown of what happened here, but it does tell us the story.

01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:24.320
Is there anything else of note?

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:28.320
Well, Veronica uploaded a video on the 4th of February generally talking about the drama again,

01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:31.320
though honestly, it seems like she's ranting off the top of her head.

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:39.320
Like, people like to assume, like, everything that anyone has ever said to me about me has been an assumption.

01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:44.320
This is like, everyone's like, oh, we hit you with facts, Veronica, facts, facts, facts, no.

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:48.320
You hit me with fucking assumptions. You hit me with a fucking opinion.

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:52.320
However, she made the fatal error of putting Nik's name in the tags,

01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:59.320
leading to a 47 minute response video from Nik a month later, destroying her with facts and logic.

01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:03.320
And for the record, this video is a passive aggressive attack on me.

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:05.320
And you want to know why? You have to look at the tags.

01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:08.320
Who does she want this video to reach?

01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:11.320
The audience of Nikocado Avocado, because she tagged me.

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:16.320
Nikocado and Veronica, as well as Nikocado exclusively.

01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:18.320
They're in the tags. Here's the receipts.

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:22.320
So, please don't say I'm just trying to make this about myself. Trust me.

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:24.320
If she would have just said sorry, even privately, like,

01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:28.320
I'm sorry for damaging your reputation and lying about you, I would move on too.

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:33.320
But here she is instigating and perpetuating drama by being mean

01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:36.320
and being passive aggressive by sticking my name in the tag

01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:39.320
so that this video gets recommended to Nikocado's followers.

01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:42.320
The pattern that we tend to establish with these videos

01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:45.320
is that if there's an opportunity to find a reason to respond,

01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:49.320
Nik will make it. Obviously, it's his prerogative to respond to whatever he wants.

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:52.320
But the premise behind this one did feel a little weak,

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:57.320
especially given how Veronica's not partaking in the most scholarly discourse.

01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:01.320
However, this was his fifth and final video on this specific matter.

01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.320
Here's the tea, if you really want it.

01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:07.320
Veronica's low effort videos were inevitably ripped apart by Nik

01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:10.320
because she assassinated her own image and initiated drama

01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:13.320
which allowed Nik to be invited in like a vampire.

01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:16.320
However, there were cracks in the foundations of his rebuttals,

01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:19.320
and yet no one, no one could have noticed at that point.

01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:23.320
Veronica's video with her friends is probably one of the most insufferable smugfests,

01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:27.320
and I have a grudging admiration that she still has it public on her channel.

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:29.320
With Veronica appropriately bodied,

01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:32.320
Nik managed to obtain some status within the community,

01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:35.320
and a fair few subscribers and new supporters.

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:37.320
These drama videos had obtained consistent views,

01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:39.320
and allowed him to be taken seriously.

01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:42.320
These new audiences weren't too familiar with his past antics

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:45.320
and became acquainted with a different Nikocado avocado,

01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:47.320
although he did say this.

01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:51.320
So he clearly wants to retain his current brand,

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:54.320
if that's what crying can be classified as.

01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:57.320
But vampires don't tend to only have one victim,

01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:00.320
and as the tea was spilled on more and more people,

01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:03.320
he had his first boss battle in sight.

01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:05.320
He's not a vampire,

01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:07.320
he's a vampire,

01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:08.320
he's a vampire,

01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:09.320
he's a vampire,

01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:10.320
he's a vampire,

01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:11.320
he's a vampire,

01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:12.320
he's a vampire,

01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:13.320
he's a vampire,

01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:14.320
he's a vampire,

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:15.320
he's a vampire,

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:23.320
etc.

01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:25.320
Trisha Paytas

01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:30.320
The amount of requests that I've had for a video on Trisha is quite astounding.

01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:34.320
but then again, she is a rather astounding person,

01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:37.320
and maybe, just maybe that time will come?

01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:41.320
but for now, she is a necessary side character in this belated tale.

01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:47.120
was one of the first popular western creators involved in promoting mukbang, and has sustained an interest

01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:54.920
in the genre since her first upload. However, she also had a history with Nikocado Avocado, dating back to 2017,

01:31:54.920 --> 01:32:00.760
when Trisha held a competition which involved covering a song from her album, and Nick decided to enter.

01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:16.880
It's a fantastic performance, and Trisha left a very enthusiastic comment in response to this video,

01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:21.160
and there were additional interactions between them on other social media platforms.

01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:27.160
However, after this, all fell silent, but as noted earlier, many had assumed that the video where he calls out

01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:30.480
fake people on social media was directed at her.

01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:58.960
However, because the video was purposely vague, nothing really came of it,

01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:06.120
but by 2019, he'd established himself in the community as a bit of a queenslayer, and now there was a formula for success,

01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:11.880
he could apply it to others within the community, and his old adversary, Trisha Paytas, was the perfect target.

01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:16.960
She was already controversial and widely hated for being rather problematic, and because of this it made people

01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:19.840
more receptive to allegations regarding her behaviour.

01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:25.720
Nick had also cracked the say for what people loved the most in exposed videos, that being receipts.

01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:31.320
He had advertised them rather conspicuously in the last set of responses to Veronica Wang and SaaS ASMR,

01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:36.640
which had been met with widespread support, so it only made sense that he included all the spicy receipts

01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:42.400
if he wanted to take Trisha Paytas down for what she did to him, so he launched his attack.

01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:48.680
We have to talk. What I'm gonna talk about happened at a point in my life where I was very...

01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:58.640
...fronerable. I was very fragile in my emotions, and this is something that's plagued me for years.

01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:04.320
His collective videos documenting the situation and what followed have obtained almost 5 million views between them,

01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:09.360
and therefore, they're at least somewhat important. Now, admittedly, they probably don't have the greatest

01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:14.280
influence because Trisha Paytas has a reputation for not being the most reliable person, however,

01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:19.280
whether the person is good or bad, you are expected to be faithful to the information that you present,

01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:21.520
and the conclusions that can be drawn.

01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:26.800
Nick's rhetoric in this video is powerful, one of vulnerability and exploitation.

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:28.960
It's an Oscar-winning performance, really.

01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:35.600
I haven't been able to move on. I haven't. And it's because I was really hurt.

01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:43.600
I was mortified in front of thousands of people. I was made fun of. I don't even know why.

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:48.120
I don't know what I did to deserve this. I have no idea what I did wrong.

01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:54.880
And I realized, after getting this video from Trisha, that I won't be able to move on until I let people know what happened

01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:58.240
and what she did to me and how it made me feel.

01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:01.840
But performance is the key word here, so I'll break it down.

01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:07.080
So he goes into the backstory, explains the warrior competition, his motives, the tweets,

01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:09.720
and then he reveals DMs between himself and Trisha.

01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:13.560
These DMs show that although being initially interested in a collaboration,

01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:19.040
and even committing to doing a shoot at some point, Trisha eventually did not follow up on this.

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:23.280
And then I said, Hi, I'm here. I'm in Hollywood. I brought you gifts. I can't wait.

01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:27.360
Can't wait to see you. I hope everything's okay. And then two days goes by.

01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:31.640
Each day, I'm like, Hi, is everything okay? Hi, did I do something wrong?

01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:36.360
Hi, Trisha. I came to LA to see you, but I don't know how to get a hold of you. Is everything okay?

01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:40.200
Next one says, If I did something wrong, can you let me know? I have gifts for me from Colombia.

01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:43.520
Never got a response, and I figured I'm probably just being a dead bush now.

01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:47.400
I stopped being vegan, so I filmed all these videos like my first Burger King burger,

01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:51.560
my first McDonald's burger, my first pizza in like six years.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:57.720
I had a great time. I was sad. I was very, very sad by this, but luckily I had things to distract me again.

01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:03.440
I had to do the run anyways. Luckily, I had other people to clap with, so I was very, very hurt.

01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:06.920
Um, but I got even more hurt after the trip, and you're gonna find out why.

01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:13.040
This is rather unsporting behaviour, and did unfairly lead Nick on with the expectations of a collaboration,

01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:16.720
before not providing him with any additional correspondence at all.

01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:19.360
On top of this, when it was brought up in future streams,

01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:24.720
she appeared to deny this version of events completely, despite the fact it was heavily evidence.

01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:30.720
I was never going to. Like, I don't know. I was never going to. I wasn't gonna, like, collab, you know what I mean?

01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:35.080
Like, I don't know where that came from. Yeah, I don't care for his videos or for his personality.

01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:41.400
What Trisha Paytas did would have rightfully hurt Nick. If I was in his shoes, I would have been a tad upset too.

01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:45.960
But honestly, this alone would have not been grounds for an exposed video, in my opinion.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:51.000
She responded to a few messages regarding a meeting, and then went dark, and once again, not to defend her,

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:56.280
but if I was in Nick's shoes with a relatively famous creator who I literally just started talking to,

01:36:56.280 --> 01:37:02.920
and who Nick literally acknowledges is incredibly busy and was in a tight spot, I would have definitely waited for further confirmation,

01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:07.080
given that Trisha's own DMs clearly show she was uncertain of the plans.

01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:13.880
Trisha Paytas is flaky, unreliable, and erratic. That's not news. Nick does acknowledge this though.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:18.080
But in your video, you talked about getting closure and being upfront and being professional,

01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:23.320
and I really appreciate if you give me a little closure too. Obviously, I don't know you and you don't know me,

01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:29.800
so obviously, this is on a much lesser scale, which I understand. Then I was completely ignored. Then you unfollowed me.

01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:34.600
Everyone keeps asking me to make a video saying what happened, your tweets, my tweets, our DMs, blah, blah, blah,

01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:39.840
and I want you to know I don't want to do that to you. I never did, and I never will. Well, until now.

01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:44.480
I hope that shows to you what my true intentions are, and hopefully that you can trust me.

01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:50.840
But privately, can you just explain to me what I did wrong? Why you still haven't said anything to this day?

01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:56.480
I'm just so confused. I was so excited that you asked to collab. I kept saying to myself,

01:37:56.480 --> 01:38:02.480
what did I do wrong? Maybe I jumped the gun without getting extra confirmation. I'm sorry.

01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:06.800
You said you were free in the schedule, and then even you said we should film Tuesday.

01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:11.440
I bought the tickets right away. Maybe you changed your mind, or maybe someone told you something about me.

01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:15.640
I don't know. Look, I'm not saying that I regret growing there. I actually met another YouTuber.

01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:20.640
I made lots of videos. I'm not complaining. I'm not going to make exposing videos. I just want to know.

01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:26.000
I would really appreciate it if you told me privately what happened on your end. Thank you, and I wish you a speedy recovery.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:31.440
Nick had a bad experience, it's a shame, but in a rather long message attempting to confront Trisha,

01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:36.800
he outwardly states that he doesn't intend to make an expose video. So what has changed since then?

01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:49.000
She saw this message, instead of just telling me straight up, she took our DMs, edited out her messages to me,

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:58.600
cropped them out, deleted them, put my messages together, and then sent them all over the internet.

01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:04.440
This is quite the allegation, what evidence is there to support it? Well, not much to be honest.

01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:10.880
The DMs were released, this was true, but as Nick recognised in this message, there were people asking after the situation,

01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:17.600
one of these individuals was Martin Lewis. Now, his upload is quite harsh on Nick's perspective due to some personal history

01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:23.520
in the vegan community. However, the DMs he shows are in full chronological order with no editing,

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:28.960
the only content that was not passed on were the first interactions between them, and the final lengthy message,

01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:35.040
which judging by the unread receipt shown in this video, was not sent at the time she passed on these screenshots.

01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:42.080
In fact, if you had a keen eye, you would have noticed that in his DM, he mentions a situation transpiring with a gentleman named Sean,

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:50.680
Trisha's ex-boyfriend, where Trisha talks about closure in a video, this video being her response to Sean released on the 27th of February.

01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:57.160
Trisha's ex-boyfriend, Sean, made a video saying what went down with me, where he gave the internet closure,

01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:07.720
but still has yet to give me any closure, a real life human being, which he spent the past year of his life day in and day out with.

01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:14.040
It's also important to note that a video uploaded by a creator by the name of Vegan Cheetah, who now goes by Charles Marlowe,

01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:19.720
appears to include receipts as well. Now, I am not in possession of the video, and it does not appear to be archived,

01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:26.880
I don't know all the exact details, but we can calculate it was released around mid February, around a month after Nick was meant to be meeting Trisha.

01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:33.200
I know this because an old Reddit post which advertised this video is still updated on the 20th of February,

01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:38.440
a week before Trisha's video response, which Nick references in his own message to her.

01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:43.920
I did find a clip from the video in another upload which explains how this was brought up in his circle.

01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:52.240
Now, I couldn't find a whole lot under that video that Trisha Paytas had uploaded, but this comment that was left on my video actually started a small thread.

01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:59.200
Taylor said, yeah, something weird happened between them. She probably set them up like she does to other YouTubers,

01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:02.840
but they're both whack jobs to be honest, so who gives a f***?

01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:09.720
And then Nicki responded to Samantha by saying, I may be wrong, but did she not end up in the hospital around that time though?

01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:15.840
Now, it's possible that Martin Lewis' video was released after Nick's DM, as it was the first of March,

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:21.120
though as we know, the DMs he'd received were prior to Nick's message, and in his video about the topic,

01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:24.560
he shows his representation of Nick was pretty biased.

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:32.800
Trisha Paytas, Nikocado Avocado said that Trisha Paytas paid for his ticket to LA.

01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:35.760
Automatically, I was like, oh my God, what did Nick do?

01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:41.040
You know, you have a lot of people, not just one person and not just trolls,

01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:51.960
but all these other people saying that Nikocado said that Trisha paid for him first class to fly to LA.

01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:57.520
And at that time, I'm like, well, who's lying? Is it these people? Is it Nikocado's fans?

01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:01.400
Or is it Nikocado? I messaged Trisha, I said to her,

01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:06.440
Nick and I used to be best friends till I disconnected from him due to his lies and opportunist mentality.

01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:09.320
Anyways, I'm doing a video on the situation between you and him.

01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:13.640
Word on YouTube says you wanted to collaborate a mukbang with him.

01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:16.480
He came to LA for you and you stood him up.

01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:20.400
Well, anyways, let me know what happened. I have your back in this.

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:28.480
But if you did something wrong, own up to it, as you know what can happen with the drama these days.

01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:34.240
Because of course, I assumed the worst because of my past with Nikocado Avocado,

01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:41.040
and it's not just one incident, it's just multiple things, and things that even continue on to this day.

01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:43.600
Like, he's lost a lot of friends, and there's a reason why.

01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:48.480
With this in mind, we can portray the reality, and look into how it was twisted.

01:42:50.400 --> 01:43:02.240
You can't follow Nick's timeline too much, because Nick has deleted a majority of his tweets,

01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:07.840
relating to Trisha from around that time at least, despite leaving others up, not sure why he did that.

01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:13.920
However, his framing that there were loads of people calling him a social climber on Twitter seems pretty unlikely,

01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:19.760
and once again, I could find little evidence, given that his criticism came from such a small niche on YouTube.

01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:25.200
In fact, if you look at Trisha's and Nikocado's joint mentions around that time, you'll see more negative

01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:30.800
comments towards Trisha from Nick's fans, mostly in reference to the 2017 video he put out,

01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:33.120
which many quickly assumed to be about Trisha.

01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:37.840
Now, I mentioned this video earlier, which is allegedly in response to a supposedly deleted,

01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:41.040
homophobic comment left by Trisha on one of Nick's videos.

01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:45.600
Some of Nick's viewers claimed they had seen it, and captured it themselves, but there is no clear

01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:51.440
record nor mention of it in Nick's all-spilling expose, which makes the more conspiratorial side

01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:56.240
of me wonder if Nick was really back at it again with his fake accounts, as he had previously used

01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:58.560
one to copyright claim our friend Rainey.

01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:03.520
On top of this, Nick fails to mention the YouNow streams, or his deleted tweets about Trisha Paytas,

01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:06.640
these ones being captured by an ardent supporter of his.

01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:11.120
I don't know the exact reason he didn't mention these in his videos, but I assume it was to avoid

01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:16.480
the perception that he had instigated the conflict in any way, and that he had remained silent.

01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:23.600
This is something that's plagued me for years, what I'm gonna talk about, and if you have no idea

01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:28.240
what's happened, and you've randomly found this video, or you know of me but don't really watch me,

01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:34.080
I mean, I don't talk about this, I never have. I've alluded to it, and when I have alluded to it,

01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:37.520
I've always said, we're not gonna discuss it, I had a great trip.

01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:43.200
I will add that all recorded drama appeared to initiate in September after Trisha's YouNow streams,

01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:47.440
but with all the deleted content, I can't comment on what happened for certain.

01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:52.320
Now, looking at the receipts we can squander together, the precipitation of the situation may be

01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:57.520
slightly different to what Mr Avocado presents. In his video, he states that he's been struggling

01:44:57.520 --> 01:44:59.600
with escaping the vegan community.

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:05.440
Around this time, I had stopped being vegan. I had just made the announcement that I didn't

01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:09.760
want to be vegan anymore, and for anyone who has been vegan, and they stopped as well, you know,

01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:15.360
it's one of the hardest things to grapple. I mean, not like, oh, I did it for a week,

01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:20.960
or I did it for a month, I mean, I did it for five years. My heart and soul into it. I was

01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:25.040
one of those people that stood out with signs, meat is murder, outside of McDonald's. That's

01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:30.160
how much it was my viewpoint. At every possible aspect, it was my life, and when I decided to stop,

01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:34.320
I thought my world was crashing down. The majority of my audience at the time

01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:38.720
was vegan. I had like 50,000 subscribers, all vegan.

01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:45.120
And it's clear that some in the vegan community still harbored a level of resentment towards him.

01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:50.400
Let me give you a little bit of background of Nikocado Avocado. Since I used to be friends

01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:57.760
with him, I kind of know how he works. In my experience, in my opinion, he has been very

01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:05.440
manipulative, you know, he has been very, he has a way of playing victim, and his audience are so

01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:09.680
brainwashed that they really feel sorry for him. We're not friends anymore because he lied about

01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:16.560
a lot of things. I used to be in a collab channel with him, and he just had the lamest excuse to

01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:22.240
close the channel down, and there was a lot of other reasons behind it. A lot of lies,

01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:29.280
playing victim, he was doing sneaky shit to make people assume something else in the comment

01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:34.960
section. These aren't random drama channels who Trisha was DMing unprovoked, however. These were

01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:40.160
people with already existent drama with Nikocado Avocado, probably looking for other ways to

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:45.440
tarnish his reputation. Vegan Cheetah had already uploaded multiple videos on Nikocado Avocado,

01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:50.080
Martin Lewis was more drama oriented in general, but still states he had previous baggage with

01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:55.280
the dude. But these videos weren't overwhelmingly popular, and Trisha's DMs didn't really reveal

01:46:55.280 --> 01:47:00.240
a narrative without the vegan creators providing their insight. Should Trisha have responded to

01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:05.200
Nik instead of the drama channels? For sure, but this wasn't malice prepense, it was completely

01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:09.680
in line with Trisha's behaviour. It's very possible that she was influenced by a lot of narratives

01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:14.000
perpetuated by certain individuals who had legitimate business towards Nik. Just because

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:18.880
she's a large YouTuber, doesn't mean she's the one influencing all these other creators

01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:23.360
with her opinions. And this is what leads me to my next point, the YouNow streams.

01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:29.520
Trisha- I was never going to, like, I don't know, I was never going to, I wasn't gonna, like, collab,

01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:33.440
you know what I mean? Like, I don't know where that came from. I do hang out with lots of YouTubers

01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:38.960
when they do come, and if I am feeling good and well, and I just get pissed when people are like,

01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:43.520
she flaked on me, she blew me off of you. Look, I never even opened his messages, and I saw I had,

01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:48.160
literally, like, 50 DMs from him that I never saw. I mean, I don't talk shit on YouTubers, but that,

01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:56.880
like, was so, like, it was just, it was weird. I was like, if I didn't respond to someone or

01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:00.080
I didn't confirm a date, I would not be booking. I don't know where he lives, apparently he lives

01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:03.520
somewhere else anyways. Nik- But she does know that I was flying there, because I told her I

01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:08.560
was already booking regardless for my visa. She does know that I don't live there, because she

01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:14.400
asked about it, and I responded, yes, I do live in Colombia. She was plain stupid in front of

01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:19.920
hundreds of thousands of people, and how do you think this affected my channel? The trust that

01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:24.800
my audience had in me? I try to watch Nikkato Avocado, but I can't when someone, this is so

01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:29.280
gross if you don't even want to eat, like, when someone, like, burps or farts when they're eating,

01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:32.320
like, well, I don't even like it anyways, but when you're eating, like, ugh, it kind of makes me

01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:37.200
gross out, so I can't with him. Well, this was, this was a surprise to me. That's not what she

01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:42.000
told me. Now, on one hand, she was fundamentally wrong, but the fact that she sent messages which

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:46.240
showed her correspondence with Nik before then appearing to deny it doesn't make it seem very

01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:51.120
calculated. Being calculated often doesn't ensue openly contradicting yourself with your own

01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:55.280
evidence. Now, there could be an element of calculation, as obviously Trisha's own You Now

01:48:55.280 --> 01:49:00.720
streams have greater reach than any of the DMs shown in the other videos, but it could also just

01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:05.280
be standard trash talk. I'll allow you to make your own judgement on that one. I think a much

01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:10.320
more textbook example of calculation would be taking this clip out of context, and then using

01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:15.520
it to support a point which otherwise has very little backing. Who would do something like that?

01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:41.840
Alright, Nick. This was another clip in Nikocado's Trisha compilation, and on first viewing, you

01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:44.880
wouldn't suspect anything until you find the full clip.

01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:16.720
Did you notice the difference? If you didn't, I wouldn't blame you, but he cut out the bit where

01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:22.560
she said she had no idea until Martin Lewis DMed her, and brought it to her attention, because she

01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:28.400
was snowed under due to other situations, situations that Nick acknowledges in his DM.

01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:33.120
Does this change the fact that her recollection is still pretty dodgy? No. She may not have been

01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:36.880
sure that he was coming at the point that she stopped responding, but she definitely set up the

01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:41.280
expectations for him to come, and it doesn't change the fact that she had more communication with him

01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:46.000
than just his violin cover, but it does show that she was not behaving in a particularly

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:50.960
instigatory manner, and I think Nick knew this, and he knew that there were murmurs before Trisha

01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:55.520
reacted. Add this to the fact that YouNow streams often involve people interacting with their

01:50:55.520 --> 01:50:59.840
audience, something that I'm sure Nick's aware of, and it's very easy that these things were brought

01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:04.960
up towards Trisha, and she just responded in her standard chaotic fashion. I don't know what this

01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:09.440
says about her other statements on the matter, because I couldn't find them, but it doesn't make

01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:14.800
me somewhat suspicious as to the ones that are cut more neatly, but we're not finished there.

01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:24.080
I mean, she, for half a year, would blast me on YouNow. Months, and months, and months. One was

01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:30.160
published in February, one was published in March, one was published in June, one was in July.

01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:46.800
TRISHA I like your avocado avocado stuff, though.

01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:50.320
NICK You like the Nickacado videos that I make?

01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:55.200
You see, our avocado acquaintance here took the YouNow clips regarding Trisha speaking about his

01:51:55.200 --> 01:51:59.840
weight gain to imply that she had been continuously bringing attention to this. In a video by the

01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:05.840
Primink, I don't know if you've heard of him, some twink, he shows the context for these clips.

01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:16.000
This is from a YouNow with Martin Lewis, the same guy who sent Trisha the DMs years ago.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:21.600
What a small world. First off, Nick was brought up first by Martin Lewis in the stream because

01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:34.800
it was a drama topic. And if you let the clip play for a few more seconds than Nick did,

01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:39.280
you can see that Trisha was actually saying she doesn't like when Martin is mean and makes fun

01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:50.240
of people. TRISHA

01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:25.520
She didn't just mention him out of the blue to talk bad about him, like Nick portrays.

01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:34.480
This clip is from a YouNow with a guy named Vegan Cheetah. Vegan Cheetah was making quite

01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:39.120
a few videos on Nick at the time, and Trisha popped into his YouNows all the time for hours

01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:44.240
and hours. I think she had a crush on him because some of the times she's drunk, which if you're

01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:49.200
ever bored, I highly recommend you go watch her drunk streams. It's an experience.

01:53:49.200 --> 01:54:02.240
TRISHA

01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:06.240
Throughout this whole YouNow Vegan Cheetah was asking Trisha how to improve his channel.

01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:27.440
He asked how to improve his topics, what videos does Trisha like, all of this stuff. And finally,

01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:32.160
she told him that she likes his Nick videos because he made a lot of Nick videos at the time.

01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:53.840
TRISHA He kept asking Trisha what she liked,

01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:59.520
and she told him what she liked. Once again, it wasn't out of the blue, she wasn't bullying him,

01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:03.680
it was a pretty normal conversation. When you're a huge YouTuber who's pretty problematic,

01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:08.160
people are going to talk about you. It comes with the territory. Nick took these super short,

01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:11.680
out of context clips and put them into a narrative that made Trisha look bad.

01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:16.480
You can make anyone look bad if you only show 10 seconds of them without any context.

01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:22.800
In this out of context clip, Trisha was actually defending Nick.

01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:37.680
The funny thing is about Nick is that he's a troll. Much like Trisha,

01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:41.200
he makes videos to make people mad or get a reaction out of them,

01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:46.160
because reactions equals views and views equals money. Both Trisha and Nick know this

01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:50.320
very well. They're both masters at it. Which is also why this video is kinda weird to me,

01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:54.560
because a lot of the things Nick calls Trisha out for, he also does on his channel.

01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:23.680
Nick- I'm done. I'm done. Get the fuck out of here.

01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:33.200
But she's not. She's playing the mental instability card.

01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:40.240
I am not having it today. I am not having it today. Today, missy two shoes.

01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:44.320
Unless Nick had picked it from a compilation video of which I could not find any,

01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:48.160
there's no way that he would have missed the context for those clips, which also means that

01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:53.200
he intentionally cut them in a way to support his point. It seems that with context, Nick Ocado

01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:58.320
showed no actual clips about Trisha Paytas talking about him without provocation, and on top of that,

01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:03.600
Trisha appears to defend him. He also frames these streams as partaking over the span of months on a

01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:08.640
continuous basis, like Trisha was just trying to drum up this continuous wave of harassment against

01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:13.680
him. A majority, if not all of the clips where she mentions Nick's weight gain are in YouNow streams

01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:18.320
with people who have pre-existing drama with Nick Ocado, and Nick wasn't the core topic of those

01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:23.120
streams regardless. You can't expect your name to never be mentioned by someone when you yourself

01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:30.800
have mentioned Trisha in passing as well. Nick- I mean, she, for half a year, would blast me

01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:37.040
on YouNow. Months, and months, and months. Now, I don't find evidence to support this either,

01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:41.360
most of the clips had Nick being brought up in passing, her streams with Vegan Cheetah definitely

01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:45.680
appear to be made around that time that they collaborated together, and I think the motive

01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:49.760
may have been a little more based on the principle of attraction. Just a hunch.

01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:55.760
So this went on for months, and months, and months, and what stemmed from it was comments,

01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:58.800
and comments, and comments for months, and months, and months.

01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:04.000
Yeah, I don't care for his videos or for his personality, but you know, whatever, it doesn't matter.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:11.840
Nick- Of people assuming the worst about me, because she gave them that platform to do so,

01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:17.040
you know, she kind of entertained the rumors, she spread the rumors herself, deliberately,

01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:21.440
and then she entertained the ones that came out of it, and laughed about it in my face.

01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:26.080
It's not hard to research his Twitter mentions from around this time, and there are really no

01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:30.320
mentions of this. Now, that's not to say they never existed, accounts are deleted,

01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:34.800
comments are also deleted sometimes, but none of the comments are present on a disproportionate

01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:39.440
basis to other drama he was engaged in at the time. If anything, it seems the people who did

01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:44.560
jump on the drama had serious baggage with Nick, and would continue to torment over other drama

01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:48.800
that Nick provoked in the coming months, including some very controversial content.

01:58:49.360 --> 01:58:54.480
Was Trisha's behavior unprofessional and unfair? Definitely, and I'll probably have to look down

01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:58.480
that rabbit hole eventually, but Nick's video felt like he had chosen a perspective based on

01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:02.720
a murky recollection of events, and then sought to find the evidence after he had chosen his

01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:07.760
position, which led to a bending of the truth, as the situation wasn't quite as he recalled.

01:59:07.760 --> 01:59:12.080
He's more than happy to show some receipts, but a lot of the remaining evidence is either impossible

01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:17.200
to verify, or doctored by Nick himself. The video felt unnecessary, and rhetoric aside,

01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:21.600
it seemed that there was very little justification for the existence of such a video, but he had one

01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:40.160
more ace up his sleeve, but it didn't really feel like an ace to me, more like a joker.

01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:57.280
The Joker card was introduced in the 19th century, as a trump card for the game of

01:59:57.280 --> 02:00:01.360
Eucra, the card that beats all others. Like the Joker in the game of Eucra,

02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:04.640
in the context of Nick's video, Trisha's video would have been a trump card.

02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:10.640
And I'm listening to this, I'm like, she loves us, she loves us together. How am I supposed to

02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:16.480
know that? You didn't answer my emails, you never told me what happened, you leaked my DMs, you went

02:00:16.480 --> 02:00:21.360
and talked trash about me for a year. How am I supposed to know that you love me this whole time?

02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:24.720
What? Through the lens of Nick's video, after failing to follow through on a commitment,

02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:29.360
lying about the situation, and then unleashing a tidal wave of animosity based on defamatory

02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:34.800
statements, she's attempted to make peace in a rather disingenuous manner over this OnlyFans video.

02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:35.520
You can listen here.

02:00:35.520 --> 02:01:04.960
And I would have loved to hear,

02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:10.560
this, I acknowledge what I did. I'm sorry I sent those messages out about you. And then she's like,

02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:13.920
well, let's not talk about that. Let's just talk about all the good things I love about you.

02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:19.040
Maybe if Nick's premise is held true, this would stand as the solid trump card, but with the context

02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:23.520
we realise that we are playing a very different card game indeed, one where the Joker doesn't

02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:28.400
hold the same value that Nick has assigned to it. Does this make Trisha an angel? No, as said,

02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:32.720
she screwed up, but her video explaining that her animosity has faded, and that she hopes they

02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:36.880
can move beyond that is probably the most mature thing she could have said. She doesn't say that

02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:41.600
the animosity was justified, nor does she attempt to push any blame onto Nick, which she could well

02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:46.000
have done. She states there probably was a communication breakdown, and although undeniable

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:50.800
sugarcoating is completely true, in fact, a communication breakdown is a perfect way to

02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:53.760
explain how irrational feelings of animosity may arise.

02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:31.280
With this in mind, the whole premise for Nick's video's existence is strange. At the time,

02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:38.240
Trisha Paytas cameos cost $150. Orlin paid $150 to someone who Nick frames as having

02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:43.360
serious history with, and on top of that, asks a person to say something negative about Nick.

02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:49.680
That is one strange birthday present, and one that conveniently fits into a video exposing her.

02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:53.840
In all honesty, I think Nick and Orlin knew what they were doing when they requested this cameo,

02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:58.400
and was probably disappointed that Trisha didn't give him anything outwardly unreasonable to work

02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:03.280
with, because as said, Trisha will have her time, and this does not excuse her other actions,

02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:08.240
but given what we know, and how certain clips are actually in context, it doesn't hold the same

02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:10.080
power, it just seems strange.

02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:49.120
I don't understand how you're sticking out for me. I've never felt that way, ever.

02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:55.680
For years. I mean, you don't even follow me on your Instagram, you don't follow me on Twitter.

02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:59.920
And again, you don't have to follow me. I'm not saying this is what upsets me, I'm saying

02:04:00.480 --> 02:04:04.800
I don't see any evidence to support that you stick up for me, and that you care about me.

02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:08.720
Like, what? And if this is real, if she is being truthful, that she loves being

02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:14.640
sticks up for me, and she thinks I'm awesome, and everything, why have I never heard from her

02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:22.480
to rectify that huge shitstorm that she pretty much caused me,

02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:28.080
and my family, and all of my viewers? For years.

02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:34.560
When this all went down years ago, I never shared my truth, I never said the truth.

02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:38.560
Overall, the video was rather weak. He states that the video exists because he didn't want to

02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:43.600
speak up the time, but if this was really his truth, he would have made it the truth.

02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:48.560
Equally, I don't think Trisha is some calculated mastermind. If anything, Nick's video is much

02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:53.360
more orchestrated than any of Trisha's actions. Was there a story here? Maybe, but it was the

02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:58.480
kind of thing that you'd rant about on the side while having an Asian KFC rather than channeling

02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:04.240
the energy into a takedown style video. But after the Veronica Wang drama, Nick had a formula that

02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:09.200
worked, and he applied it to another person who was not known for their concise responses. In fact,

02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:14.320
Trisha was just coming off the back of another contentious drama with H3H3, another situation

02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:18.880
which she could have presented a strong case fairly rationally, but devolved into antics

02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:26.560
which many felt were emotionally manipulative. She goes from model to WWE wrestler, like,

02:05:26.560 --> 02:05:31.920
it's just, it already has such a complex, it's such a complex.

02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:40.640
It was another easy target for Nick, and he composed the video using the scraps that he obtained

02:05:40.640 --> 02:05:45.920
very well. For Trisha, it was a hard situation to overturn. She had let him down, and ultimately,

02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:50.400
even if a portion of Nick's allegations were built on exaggerated rhetoric and edited content,

02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:54.560
her failure to resolve it and instead resorting to going on streams of people who Nick clearly

02:05:54.560 --> 02:05:58.720
had negative experiences with was highly unprofessional. Sure, the video said things

02:05:58.720 --> 02:06:03.680
about Nick, but it also said things about Trisha, and at the time, people cared more about one person

02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:08.000
than the other, so no matter what Trisha said, she was going to be fighting a losing battle.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:12.480
Nick knew this, so he just jumped on whatever she said for a response video. Some of this stuff

02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:17.200
seems related to what he's been saying, such as those tweets on the day of the video. Other stuff,

02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:18.560
not as much.

02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:21.440
But one thing we have to remember is that the internet is not real life.

02:06:22.480 --> 02:06:28.080
People that you interact with on the internet can be lovely and wonderful,

02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:32.240
but they can also be really hateful and negative and evil.

02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:38.400
I did not tell people to unfollow her. I didn't tell people to dislike her. I didn't tell people

02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:45.200
to unsubscribe. I didn't tell people to leave hateful comments. I didn't bring anyone else

02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:52.000
unrelated to our issue into the video. I didn't tell people what to think, ultimately.

02:06:53.200 --> 02:06:59.680
I shared my truth. I told the truth. I backed up my truth with evidence.

02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:07.920
I came to the table prepared with receipts, and I was 100% transparent.

02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:11.120
Nick has no proof that this comment has anything to do with his video,

02:07:11.120 --> 02:07:15.840
other than it was from around that general time. It doesn't seem the most relevant for someone who's

02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:20.880
so used to random hate online. Nick appears to think that Trisha could only be referring to him

02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:25.920
as the sole perpetrator of such antagonism. Amongst the controversy she had been entangled in,

02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:30.640
although she had made amends in the H3 situation, her comments did not seem creator specific,

02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:35.520
and Nick goes in on this, and the stupid thing is, he gives the reasons for exactly why the

02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:55.600
comment probably isn't directed at him. Some of his responses are valid. Once again,

02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:59.680
Trisha made the mistake, and he's sure to hammer that in, but some of his other statements are

02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:05.440
either disingenuous, unproven, or so unbelievably ironic that it's borderline satire.

02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:10.560
What I don't understand, if she wants to imply that I'm not being truthful with what I showed

02:08:10.560 --> 02:08:16.080
everybody, she needs to prove otherwise. I mean, it's one of these things where some people believe

02:08:16.080 --> 02:08:22.880
if they say it over and over and over enough that it becomes true. If you hear it enough times,

02:08:23.760 --> 02:08:30.960
that's a fact. But it's not. And I told everyone what happened. I showed them the DMs.

02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:34.960
I showed the video clips of her acting like she didn't know who I was,

02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:40.480
making faces when my weight came into discussion, egging people on to continue the gossip.

02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:45.680
All the while, I had to watch this in humility. I would like to know how I'm not being truthful

02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:51.120
here. If she wants to make these implications, she has to show for it. Otherwise, it's just

02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:57.600
flat out rude, and it's just another slap in the face. Trisha then posted a mukbuk

02:08:57.600 --> 02:09:03.840
right after she had posted a video saying that she's done with mukbangs, and that she's going to

02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:09.920
address her diet and change it. If she's willing to go to this length to lie about something so

02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:15.520
trivial as what you eat, what else do you think she's willing to do? Actually, someone replied

02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:18.880
to me and said, it's obviously prerecorded, you're starting to look desperate. And I said, no.

02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:26.000
First of all, Trisha has been doing this to me for two years. Two years, I had to read these

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:32.640
comments, feel this pain, and keep it to myself. Over two years, two and a half years. This is my

02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:39.600
moment. And the fact that it is prerecorded, and she chose to put a mukbang right after announcing

02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:45.680
she was done with them, it shows that she knows how to play her cards. She knows that it will get

02:09:45.680 --> 02:09:51.040
a reaction, it will make people upset, it will create more comments. When I told people that

02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:58.080
Trisha was calculating with me, I'm willing to say that she's calculating with you. And how smart

02:09:58.080 --> 02:10:02.800
of Trisha to use a card like this, because let's face it, in society, if you question

02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:09.680
the validity of what she says, you're seen as an awful person. And this is a very powerful card.

02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:12.640
But one thing we have to remember is that the internet is not real life.

02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:19.520
So if the internet's not real, what's going on? Smoke and mirrors. This is a way to cop out

02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:23.920
and to cover up, because it's that touchy of a subject.

02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:30.800
Ah yes, Trisha, the mastermind. Thank you Nick for illuminating that very manipulative tweet.

02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:37.360
Trisha is very smart indeed, a true galaxy brain of our generation. But for me, with my game,

02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:42.560
his Joker card was useless, and only served to highlight the absurdity of some of his statements.

02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:49.520
Remember you guys, I came back, literally with a luggage, full of coffee, full of sombreros,

02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:55.280
full of keychains and little presents for Trisha, and sat down and said, what the fuck did I do

02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:59.920
wrong? And then to turn the computer and to see Trisha talking about my weight, regardless,

02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:06.160
was so manipulative and just another part of the mind control, another part of the,

02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:10.640
look who has the power, type of game she was playing.

02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:15.600
Mind control. This is the man that many believed, but how long would that belief last for?

02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:26.800
As said, Trisha's behaviour wasn't appropriate, and I can understand why it would bother Nick,

02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:31.840
but it didn't strike me as dangerous or out of character. She didn't follow up with him on plans

02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:38.320
to collaborate, unreliable and flaky, but Nick said he was okay with that. She sent DMs to drama

02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:43.200
channels who asked, kinda trashy but not edited like Nick claims, and not at the time that he

02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:48.240
claims either. She goes onto a stream with some of these channels and mentions him, expected,

02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:53.280
not to the degree he claims, and not necessarily maliciously either. The only real thing that there

02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:57.760
is to complain about here is that she misframes the situation when talking about it, and appears

02:11:57.760 --> 02:12:03.440
to dismiss the contact they had, which is unfair, but as said, I don't think it makes her some

02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:06.960
calculated mastermind, and even some of that was taken out of context.

02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:11.120
Nick- I'm just putting it out there because you put it out there for two and a half years,

02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:19.520
how you felt about me. This is how I feel about you. You heard me, and I don't want to play this game.

02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:25.760
I don't want to play dog and bone, smoking mirrors, whipping out cards, and brushing things under the rug.

02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:31.920
Just turn on the camera, remind all your viewers that the internet is real,

02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:41.040
that your feelings and the things you say to other humans are real, and that includes me.

02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:46.960
But Nick, without a doubt, was masterclassing these exposed videos. In his second video,

02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:50.880
he even retracts his points about the clips because people found the context for them,

02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:54.880
and still manages to convey the necessity for the existence of this upload.

02:12:54.880 --> 02:13:02.000
She's eating popcorn, watching me be made fun of, watching people speculate, watching people

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:07.760
talk negatively, watching people gossip. She enjoyed it, and that's what she said in this clip.

02:13:07.760 --> 02:13:26.080
Nick- Part of that context was my weight gain. I wasn't specific. I flew over it literally in 30

02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:29.360
seconds. I just wanted to say that she had mentioned my weight gain, and it made me

02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:34.480
uncomfortable. I wish I could take that out. It doesn't change the fact from anything. I was

02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:39.360
just trying to find examples to show you that she did know who I was, and she continued to talk

02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:44.320
smack. Eventually, he goes in on Trisha for her antics regarding a breakup that happened months

02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:48.400
before. Everything must have been taken out of context. Remember what I said? She's going to

02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:55.360
smoke and mirrors, throw another bone, make the dogs run this way. Guess who decides to

02:13:55.360 --> 02:14:01.680
have that monumental breakdown about a breakup that happened three or four months ago? That's

02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:06.560
right. Trisha posts a breakdown about Jason. Didn't she just say she wishes him well and loves

02:14:06.560 --> 02:14:11.440
him? Didn't she just say something about his dick or something? All of a sudden, now she's really,

02:14:11.440 --> 02:14:17.360
really sad. I almost feel like she got the sadness for knowing that she effed up, saw everyone coming

02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:23.280
at her in the corner, got all emotional, and used that emotion to tap into her feelings about Jason.

02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:27.600
I mean, she's an actress. She's a self-proclaimed actress. She has been on so many TV shows with

02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:30.320
different personalities. I remember watching an interview where she said,

02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:36.640
I want to be someone that you don't know who I really am. That's fucked up when it involves

02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:41.360
hurting other people. Initially, this was stupefying to me because he was calling out Trisha for

02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:46.160
something that had been a part of his brand for years, claiming that it's some elaborate ploy,

02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:51.360
when in fact, it's completely the opposite. The timing is so unbelievably awful that no half

02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:56.240
intelligent, manipulative person would make such a video, and people called it out without Nick's

02:14:56.240 --> 02:15:01.120
help. Trisha's eventual response video would be called, I'm cancelled again, a reference to the

02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:06.640
number of times this happens. Nick knows this too well, and yet frames it like some revelation.

02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:14.400
People were on it from the get-go, and then she decided to just ban all comments, ban all ability

02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:19.520
to thumbs up or thumbs down. I mean, if you stand by what you say and believe in, you will always

02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:24.560
leave that open, and for the majority of Trisha's channel, she always has. I mean, I can think of

02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:29.440
probably one video where she actually banned people from being able to share their thoughts

02:15:29.440 --> 02:15:35.440
on her page. This screams guilty, louder than anything. Nick had the tea, but the tea was

02:15:35.440 --> 02:15:40.240
tainted, and Trisha's eventual response video, although flawed, did illuminate that.

02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:44.080
You know, Woody Allen still frickin' works, you know what I mean? Like, Roman Polanski...

02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:50.640
Did he do something wrong? Yeah, he did something wrong. Wait, wrong clip. It happens at this time

02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:54.160
of the video. Everyone keeps telling me a video about you, I just watched your video about

02:15:54.160 --> 02:15:57.280
Sean. I'm so sorry for everything you went through. I don't know when the best time is

02:15:57.280 --> 02:16:00.240
to ask, but you talked about getting closure, being upfront, being a professional, and I

02:16:00.240 --> 02:16:07.200
really appreciate if you gave me a little closure too. I don't owe you closure. Chalk me up as to

02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:12.640
some flaky lunatic YouTuber, as I do. I meet so many frickin' YouTubers and so many people that

02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:16.800
are flaky and crazy. I'm just like, oh, that's just a crazy person. I'm just gonna, you know...

02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:24.000
Closure is something when a friend dumps you after 10 years. Closure is something after

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:28.320
someone's cheated on you and trying to find out why, and like, that's when someone owes you

02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:33.040
something because you put in so much time. It may have been common courtesy to tell someone about

02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:38.880
their position. Patricia didn't want to, and is okay with being judged on that basis. I don't think

02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:44.160
her response is the strongest because I think you need to accept some fault. She acted incredibly

02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:48.800
enthusiastically towards his works, and then just stopped responding. It probably did confuse him

02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:53.440
and lead him on, and she did trash talk a bit in future streams, but over the space of two rather

02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:57.680
erratic videos, she provides an explanation for a majority of her actions.

02:16:57.680 --> 02:17:01.440
This is the other reason why I'm just like so scared to even say I'm always down, but like I said,

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:05.520
when things change, they change, and like, yeah, at the time I would go on YouNow and talk about it,

02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:09.600
because at the time he did say I paid for his thing. Everyone was like, he didn't say that,

02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:16.640
but he did. I didn't edit out anything. I screenshotted. I'm not an editor.

02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:22.080
Whether you think these explanations justify her point of view is down to you, and yet a day after

02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:27.920
Trisha's second video mentioning the situation, Nick uploads another 18 minute video, and it is the worst.

02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:32.720
The first two minutes in particular are shocking, and you can literally play Trisha's clips from the

02:17:32.720 --> 02:17:36.640
videos that Nick is responding to as many responses to his points.

02:18:02.720 --> 02:18:06.480
When things change, they change, and like, yeah, at the time I would go on YouNow and talk about it,

02:18:06.480 --> 02:18:11.120
because at the time he did say I paid for his thing. Everyone was like, he didn't say that, but he did.

02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:38.560
reputation when I was very small. Why did she not move on? Where she felt the need to entertain

02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:43.520
rumors about me. Some of the things that she's saying about me that my viewers might be believing.

02:18:43.520 --> 02:18:48.720
Again, this is not for her. She's made it very clear. She has no care in the world for me.

02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:53.440
So on the YouNow, I say to, I was talking to, what was that guy? There's some drama channel.

02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:57.760
Good as me. Oh, I forgot his name. Honestly, this sounds awful, but I like, I don't care.

02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:03.200
And that's fine. I will live with that. He also showed video where you kept talking about his

02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:10.720
weight more than once. I saw the video. Do you regret that? But he edited. So on the YouNow,

02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:14.800
I say to, I was talking to, what was that guy? There's some drama channel. I forgot his name.

02:19:14.800 --> 02:19:18.880
Oh, I forgot his name. And I literally say he gained weight and like, okay, so he got fat.

02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:23.280
So what? And he added that part where I'm like, so what? I went on Social Blade because I'm a curious

02:19:23.280 --> 02:19:29.280
George. And your numbers have gone down over the last week by a considerable amount. Nothing James

02:19:29.280 --> 02:19:36.880
Charles, but clearly people have not loved your reaction, your response to all this drama. And

02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:42.240
his video has done very well. It's got like 2 million views. How does that make you feel?

02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:48.480
I mean, it like, honestly, it just sounds awful, but I like, I don't care because this is something

02:19:48.480 --> 02:19:53.920
that I am so like, I'm sorry. I felt, I didn't, I felt harassed by him. Like he like kept going,

02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:59.840
dm, dm, dm. He harassed, he lied. I didn't, I felt harassed by him. That was, it was so insane. It

02:19:59.840 --> 02:20:04.080
was so insane and so scary to me. And if you're scared and you're like a little like, I'm being

02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:10.240
targeted by a weird and she's being targeted by a weird and she's like reverse psychology.

02:20:10.240 --> 02:20:15.360
She's saying that this is who I am. And by reacting, I'm therefore proving her point.

02:20:16.320 --> 02:20:22.240
I've never been manipulated like this in my whole life. Um, and that's why this video is hard for me

02:20:22.240 --> 02:20:27.360
to make. Nick frames it like he's the victim of some master puppeteering from Trisha Paytas,

02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:32.720
which is giving her far too much credit. I could go on for the record in that clip. Trisha's

02:20:32.720 --> 02:20:36.640
actually reading out someone else's comments, but I think Nick knows that. I don't think Nick

02:20:36.640 --> 02:20:40.960
harassed her or anything, and I don't think it's fair of Trisha to claim that. But Nick talking

02:20:40.960 --> 02:20:47.280
with the hushed tones and sincere confusion and hurt is by no means any less disingenuous

02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:52.960
than Trisha. Trisha's responses are not very good. You could take them apart quite easily.

02:20:52.960 --> 02:20:58.000
Nick does this with some of the responses, such as Trisha's rather dark tweets, but mostly fails

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:03.200
with others because it doesn't fit into his narrative. For example, and tried to ruin my

02:21:03.200 --> 02:21:10.640
reputation on purpose and then twist it so that if I react, I'm crazy. She says he's a little off,

02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:15.520
and gestures to imply he's unhinged, and it is insensitive, and suddenly it's actually

02:21:15.520 --> 02:21:20.480
this gaslighting tactic to make him doubt his intentions in making another 18 minute video.

02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:25.600
But I don't buy it. Gaslighting is built on intent, as we'll soon find out, and I don't believe

02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:31.200
that Trisha had that intent. I think she saw a person who messaged her a lot, paid $150 for a

02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:36.560
cameo to use in a video against her before posting another over her failures, and she probably

02:21:36.560 --> 02:21:41.520
thought he was a bit unstable. Does that mean it's the right thing to say? No, but Nick's narrative

02:21:41.520 --> 02:21:46.320
that she's some master manipulator is based on the premise that Trisha was just on some campaign of

02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:50.960
harassment against him, and is now trying to silence him, a narrative that doesn't really stand

02:21:50.960 --> 02:21:55.840
when you consider the flaws in his own. If I was in Trisha's shoes, if I believed that Nick was

02:21:55.840 --> 02:22:00.880
really that bothered over DMs, he genuinely thought I was out to destroy him and made multiple

02:22:00.880 --> 02:22:05.840
videos for that reason alone, maybe I think he was a little unhinged too, but I don't think that was

02:22:05.840 --> 02:22:10.320
his motive. I think he was capitalising on a personal problem that he previously held against

02:22:10.320 --> 02:22:15.360
a controversial creator acquiring some reputation points, and grabbing Trisha's attention in that

02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:20.960
moment too, and to be fair, it worked. Despite Trisha being a master manipulator, and Nick being

02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:26.000
this crazed stalker, Trisha apologised at the start of August and they hashed it out in another mukbang,

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
so maybe they do deserve each other.

02:22:28.320 --> 02:22:33.440
Look, like, the internet is so huge, you have such a big following, like, you just go do you, like,

02:22:33.440 --> 02:22:38.560
you're doing so good, like, I know it's fun, like, you're getting them views and stuff, like, by going

02:22:38.560 --> 02:22:42.960
back and forth with me, but like, honestly, like, when I'm- and there's some people I'm just done

02:22:42.960 --> 02:22:46.480
with, and I will- I will never acknowledge again this person being one of them after today.

02:22:50.480 --> 02:22:56.640
I'm really sorry. I obviously would never have made a cameo if I hated you, or had any ill will,

02:22:56.640 --> 02:23:02.160
or any sort of resentment. I didn't realise you still had it towards me, and again, I apologise.

02:23:02.160 --> 02:23:10.240
I apologise for how everything went down, and I respect what you do, and I applaud your success.

02:23:11.440 --> 02:23:16.320
I personally think the only manipulator in this situation was Nick, however, in his mind,

02:23:16.320 --> 02:23:22.560
the means justified the ends. He had been wronged, he'd righted it, and collected a W in the process.

02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:27.920
Throughout the videos, I received the impression that Nick really just wanted Trish's attention,

02:23:27.920 --> 02:23:33.360
and in the end, he did acquire that, so fair play to him, but by collecting a W,

02:23:33.360 --> 02:23:37.280
Nick set a standard, one that could ultimately do more harm than good.

02:23:37.280 --> 02:23:57.120
Nick's second video on Trisha Paytas in particular is a fascinating video for me,

02:23:57.120 --> 02:24:01.760
because he basically calls out something that we can identify in his own brand, the forced

02:24:01.760 --> 02:24:06.880
melodrama. So why didn't people call him out for hypocrisy in that moment? Well, there was one key

02:24:06.880 --> 02:24:12.080
difference, that Nick never weaponised his overly emotional videos with regards to drama with other

02:24:12.080 --> 02:24:17.120
creators. He provoked his own drama. Why is this detail important? Because it allowed Nick to create

02:24:17.120 --> 02:24:21.680
a new commentary brand about other creators which was detached from his otherwise capricious

02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:27.120
reputation. He is able to transform this image into a creator who's not afraid to spill the tea

02:24:27.120 --> 02:24:31.840
and call out other people who are engaging in these deplorable actions. Things were looking

02:24:31.840 --> 02:24:35.920
up for Nick, as he established himself as a legitimate voice of common sense from within

02:24:35.920 --> 02:24:39.760
the community. I don't know if that says more about Nick, or the community, but he released

02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:44.320
multiple videos, particularly on a news third channel about trending drama and personal feuds.

02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:55.360
Because I've never, you know, everything that happened, the fact that we have the ability to

02:24:56.640 --> 02:25:08.080
come back and be who we are because, you know, us growing up. Oh, oh, all about ourselves again.

02:25:08.080 --> 02:25:15.520
This was the issue that I personally had watching the whole charade five months ago, four months ago.

02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:20.400
But it was all about me, me, me, me, me, me. I don't even know. This was about what they did to

02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:24.800
someone else. Instead of focusing on the victims, we're gonna focus on ourselves. Everything we've

02:25:24.800 --> 02:25:31.040
been to, everything we go through, we're ourselves. If that's yourself, I hope I don't bump into you on

02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:35.040
the street. In the comment sections of these videos, many viewers would praise Nick for his

02:25:35.040 --> 02:25:39.600
clinical nature while dealing with this drama, but true to his word, he continued to upload videos

02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:44.880
dramatizing his own life with often mixed feedback. He was by no means letting off the other persona

02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:48.880
with the minds of this new one. However, it did make the tonal shifts a little jarring.

02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:56.720
This is your fault, Missy. This is your fault. I broke it now. It's your fault.

02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:16.720
Nick's call-out videos may have been valid in some ways. If you want to find out, you can go and

02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:20.560
watch them all. But ultimately, what the drama with Trisha Paytas told us is that a lot of

02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:25.680
audiences tend to trust the creator if they can convey themselves in a credible way, rather than

02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:30.400
necessarily looking at the claims. For anyone familiar with Nick, they would have noticed that

02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:35.120
this wasn't all too different to his persona when he exited the vegan community, and tried to make

02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:39.760
some pretty solidly reasoned arguments for why he left, but ultimately let that part of himself go

02:26:39.760 --> 02:26:44.480
when he had to confront that maybe his new lifestyle wasn't as physically beneficial as he

02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:49.840
had previously preached. But now he had a new use for his reasoned persona, YouTube drama. What

02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:55.360
could possibly go wrong? While Nick was operating multiple personas at once, this allowed him to

02:26:55.360 --> 02:26:59.840
make the most of multiple audiences, but when you're operating different personas, some of which

02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:04.320
may seem incompatible with each other, you may be biting off more than you can chew. However, for

02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:09.440
most of 2019, he was able to balance these new characters and reap the benefits for it, whether

02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:15.840
that be financial or fanatical, but there was one more advantage worth noting. Assumedly a consequence,

02:27:15.840 --> 02:27:21.040
though it could be coincidental, was that he began to collaborate with a fair few new faces, many of

02:27:21.040 --> 02:27:25.520
whom large established creators from within the community. There didn't seem to be any particular

02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:29.440
friction between these individuals, the worst that some people observed was probably Nick's

02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:34.320
collaborations with Trisha Paytas, which many felt were a little awkward, but to be honest, their

02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:36.040
whole existence is awkward.

02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:41.280
Nick, can I just say one of my favourite things on you now, a long time ago, when you were talking to someone

02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:46.240
we don't want to mention, you were just like, the views are gone, the views are down.

02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:47.440
Did I say that about me or you?

02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:48.800
There's no views about yourself.

02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:49.300
Oh yeah.

02:27:49.300 --> 02:27:53.280
You were on YouNow, like, the views are down, there's no more views, the views are gone.

02:27:53.280 --> 02:27:56.720
You watched it a bunch of times, you have my bannerisms and everything, I was like, okay.

02:27:56.720 --> 02:27:57.720
It was funny.

02:27:57.720 --> 02:28:03.280
Nick appeared to welcome many of these collaborations with open arms, why wouldn't he? The more alliances

02:28:03.320 --> 02:28:05.160
and apparent endorsements the merrier.

02:28:05.160 --> 02:28:09.280
Maybe his collaborators were hoping that if they worked with him, they wouldn't have to suffer at the

02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:10.760
hands of any exposed videos.

02:28:10.760 --> 02:28:13.640
I mean, they probably had reason to not blow him off at least.

02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:21.360
Nikocado Avocado, our Mukbang King, riding high on top of the world with all his new little friends.

02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:26.680
Now, Trisha Paytas aside, most of his new YouTube collaborators, at least, had little previous involvement

02:28:26.680 --> 02:28:28.680
in public views with Mr Avocado.

02:28:28.720 --> 02:28:34.000
However, in December, with Christmas quickly approaching, we were introduced to an individual by the name of

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.480
Stephanie Soo, but this was no first impression.

02:28:36.480 --> 02:28:41.920
No, this was around the year anniversary of the Veronica Wang drama, which was inspired by Shook Bang's

02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:45.400
edited footage of Veronica's collaboration with our friend Stephanie here.

02:28:45.880 --> 02:28:48.840
The other individual of interest is Zach Choi ASMR.

02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:51.400
He had previously collaborated with Nick and Stephanie.

02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:56.280
However, in mid-December, they decided to put their powers together and conduct a three-way collab on each

02:28:56.280 --> 02:28:57.120
of their brother's channels.

02:28:57.120 --> 02:29:01.320
Nick and Zach have done this before, but it was the first for Stephanie on either channel.

02:29:01.320 --> 02:29:05.200
The first video was uploaded onto Zach's channel on the 15th of December.

02:29:05.200 --> 02:29:08.960
Nothing seems out of the ordinary because no one actually talks in his videos.

02:29:08.960 --> 02:29:13.560
It was a similar case for the second video, which came out on Nick's third channel the day after.

02:29:27.280 --> 02:29:35.800
The day after that, a video went up on Nick's main channel, where they enjoy 10 packs of spicy ramen noodles

02:29:35.800 --> 02:29:37.920
and actually have the opportunity to talk.

02:29:37.920 --> 02:29:43.600
Nothing seems particularly out of the ordinary, but for a brief spell towards the end, the previous drama is brought up.

02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:46.920
What did you want to share, or do you change your mind now?

02:29:50.280 --> 02:29:54.720
You said you wanted to talk to your viewers with me here because you never talked to any of your viewers.

02:29:54.720 --> 02:30:03.680
I guess the thing that I would clear up is that a lot of people think that I didn't like you after those videos.

02:30:03.680 --> 02:30:05.680
Okay, I didn't say that. Oh, I didn't see them.

02:30:05.680 --> 02:30:12.320
Yeah, so I guess it kind of made it seem like because of those videos, we didn't publicly talk to each other

02:30:12.320 --> 02:30:17.080
or post pictures or videos until way after when we met a couple months ago.

02:30:17.080 --> 02:30:17.720
Maybe a year later.

02:30:17.720 --> 02:30:24.240
Yes, so during that time period, people thought that maybe we didn't like each other at all because of those videos.

02:30:24.240 --> 02:30:26.880
So, I mean, I didn't feel that way though.

02:30:26.880 --> 02:30:29.720
I didn't even feel teary.

02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:33.080
Now, keep in mind that I still hadn't watched Stephanie Sue's video at this point,

02:30:33.080 --> 02:30:38.800
but with the experience that I have with Nick's content, I noticed that this part in particular was more heavily edited

02:30:38.800 --> 02:30:42.120
than other parts of the video and seemed to end rather awkwardly.

02:30:42.120 --> 02:30:45.480
It made me rather suspicious that there were some interactions missing here.

02:30:45.480 --> 02:30:50.760
One more point I would like to add is that on the 16th of December, the day after the second video was posted,

02:30:50.800 --> 02:30:56.120
it made some tweets alluding to spilling tea on another creator, alongside some Instagram comments,

02:30:56.120 --> 02:31:02.400
and on the 20th of December, he made a video on All In's channel stating that he planned to expose another creator.

02:31:02.400 --> 02:31:07.600
So with one video uploaded on Zach Troy's channel and two on Nikocado's channels,

02:31:07.600 --> 02:31:11.920
there was an expectation that Stephanie Sue would be uploading a video too, and she did.

02:31:11.920 --> 02:31:12.720
Let's have a look.

02:31:12.720 --> 02:31:19.720
Hi, so I haven't really posted on this channel in the past couple of days or my other channel and I'm alive.

02:31:19.760 --> 02:31:25.760
I think I didn't get me and some of you guys are worried, but I just kind of want to talk to you guys about what's been happening

02:31:25.760 --> 02:31:30.320
the past couple of days because a lot has happened, and it's been really stressful.

02:31:30.320 --> 02:31:31.320
Ah.

02:31:37.080 --> 02:31:42.200
On the 21st of December, Stephanie Sue uploaded her video about her less than positive experience with

02:31:43.200 --> 02:31:51.440
titled Why I Am Scared of Nikocado Avocado, a 47 minute video dragging Nick and some of his behaviour pretty brutally.

02:31:51.440 --> 02:31:57.640
The video has now obtained over 10 million views and is widely cited as the video which wiped out any of Nick's

02:31:57.640 --> 02:31:58.840
credibility online.

02:31:58.840 --> 02:32:02.320
For me, there's a bit more to it, but let's talk about how and why.

02:32:02.320 --> 02:32:08.320
Stephanie's video is ultimately about how Nick has used his power and influence in situations to manipulate,

02:32:08.360 --> 02:32:12.440
bully and control Stephanie to the point where she feels unsafe.

02:32:12.440 --> 02:32:17.200
Like I've been manipulated by fear that I can't say no to him.

02:32:17.200 --> 02:32:24.840
I just want to take back my power to say no, not feel like someone's holding this thing over me and threatening me.

02:32:24.840 --> 02:32:29.040
It's a very unforgiving perspective of Nikocado and his behaviour.

02:32:29.040 --> 02:32:30.680
What does this behaviour entail?

02:32:30.680 --> 02:32:34.280
Well, as noted, Stephanie was vaguely involved in the Veronica Wang drama.

02:32:34.280 --> 02:32:39.640
Stephanie claims that she had spoken to Nick then for a brief period and that Nick wanted her to make a video on the topic,

02:32:39.640 --> 02:32:40.640
but she declined.

02:32:40.640 --> 02:32:42.720
Stephanie didn't want anything to do with the drama.

02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:45.600
He wanted me to make a video on my side of the story.

02:32:45.600 --> 02:32:47.720
I had told him that I wasn't involved.

02:32:47.720 --> 02:32:49.400
I don't think I need to make a video.

02:32:49.400 --> 02:32:50.840
It was just back and forth of that.

02:32:50.840 --> 02:32:53.000
There have been various additional attempts to collaborate,

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:58.440
but it wasn't until a meal with Zach Choi that they truly managed to move past the hurdle of prior drama.

02:32:58.440 --> 02:33:09.880
And at this point, we had been there for hours and he had made me feel so comfortable, so, so comfortable.

02:33:09.880 --> 02:33:12.240
And like I could trust him.

02:33:12.240 --> 02:33:14.320
Like he understood me.

02:33:14.320 --> 02:33:19.400
I ended up opening up about something that I don't even talk about on YouTube anymore.

02:33:19.400 --> 02:33:23.240
If you guys have been with me since the beginning, some of you may know.

02:33:23.240 --> 02:33:28.600
But I was sexually assaulted in my own home.

02:33:28.600 --> 02:33:35.160
It was somebody that I had let into my home and then they took away my power to say no.

02:33:35.160 --> 02:33:44.120
And it's kind of just shattered any sort of security, any sort of security that I felt at home prior.

02:33:44.120 --> 02:33:50.800
And then after that, I left with the very warm feeling of just, hey, he's nice.

02:33:50.800 --> 02:33:54.080
Nick seemed very warm and sympathetic over the next few months.

02:33:54.080 --> 02:34:00.320
There are poor built with her being open and talking about her home security and some anxieties that surrounded it.

02:34:00.320 --> 02:34:05.040
In December, they agreed to collaborate on each other's channels with Zach over the space of the weekend.

02:34:05.040 --> 02:34:10.280
And although the first day of recording went off without a hitch, it went rapidly downhill on the second.

02:34:10.280 --> 02:34:12.520
Firstly, the topic of Veronica was brought up.

02:34:12.520 --> 02:34:18.520
Nick asserted that Stephanie committed to talking about it the day before, despite Stephanie having no recollection of this.

02:34:18.520 --> 02:34:25.120
Before we filmed Nick's video, his first video, the talking mukbang, we were supposed to go to H Mart and then go back to his place so that we could film it.

02:34:25.120 --> 02:34:30.040
And we were in the car and the topic of what we were going to talk about in the talking mukbang came up.

02:34:30.040 --> 02:34:36.600
And this is kind of when I first felt really uncomfortable because Nick said it very assertively.

02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:39.600
We're going to talk about Veronica and we're going to spill all the tea.

02:34:39.600 --> 02:34:43.880
And I was kind of confused because I was like, oh, whoa, what?

02:34:43.880 --> 02:34:46.800
And so I was immediately like, no, no.

02:34:46.800 --> 02:34:51.080
And then he he went, but why did you tell me yesterday that you wanted to then?

02:34:51.080 --> 02:34:53.600
And so I thought back to what happened yesterday.

02:34:53.600 --> 02:35:02.120
And prior to filming my mukbang for my channel, he had mentioned, you know, I think that we need to talk about Shukbang because, you know, everyone's going to be talking about it in the comments.

02:35:02.120 --> 02:35:03.960
And I don't know why I believed it.

02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:08.560
I said, oh, yeah, I mean, I guess it's weirder if we just act like it never happened.

02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:14.160
And so I felt like I was comfortable mentioning Shukbang, addressing it to the capacity of me and Nick.

02:35:14.240 --> 02:35:20.120
Yes, this is how we met through a Shukbang video, but we have no ill will towards each other.

02:35:20.120 --> 02:35:21.840
It's all over. We're friends now.

02:35:21.840 --> 02:35:30.240
You know, I felt like I would never tell him that I wanted to talk about Veronica and specifically spill the tea.

02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:32.400
It had always been about Shukbang.

02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:34.400
She cleared this up and thought it was dealt with.

02:35:34.400 --> 02:35:37.600
However, around half an hour into their second collaboration video,

02:35:37.600 --> 02:35:44.040
Nick brings up the topic of Shukbang and Veronica and allegedly begins twisting Stephanie's words very viciously.

02:35:44.040 --> 02:35:50.520
And I just remember feeling just shocked because the way he went about it was just so almost like an interrogation.

02:35:50.520 --> 02:35:52.920
But I was like, you know what? It's fine. It's fine.

02:35:52.920 --> 02:35:55.680
I'm going to, you know, joke it off. I'm going to say my piece.

02:35:55.680 --> 02:36:01.880
I said, you know, I don't have any hard feelings because you made those videos and I get why you made those videos.

02:36:01.880 --> 02:36:06.760
I had these baby wipes in front of me and I kept wiping him every time he got too serious to just kind of play it off.

02:36:06.760 --> 02:36:07.720
Like, let me wipe him off.

02:36:07.720 --> 02:36:13.200
And every single time I tried to do that, increasingly, it seemed like he got more offended.

02:36:13.200 --> 02:36:20.640
He would look at me with such a shocked face, like, I can't believe, but you said you wanted to talk about it.

02:36:20.640 --> 02:36:24.120
And now you don't? Almost like, how dare you?

02:36:24.280 --> 02:36:26.080
You said you wanted to talk about it.

02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:28.640
And I just remember I kept trying to put it off.

02:36:28.640 --> 02:36:30.280
I kept trying to show him I'm uncomfortable.

02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:36.640
I kept trying to lighten the mood with jokes and give all of us an out of this conversation without ending it awkwardly.

02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:39.120
But it was just rapid fire.

02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:44.920
And it increasingly went from Shukba, maybe the first two sentences, into Veronica.

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:52.800
And then instead of asking me any more questions, he started twisting my words and he started saying things like,

02:36:52.920 --> 02:37:00.480
if only you guys knew what she told me, I would never tell you guys what happened because she shared it with me in private.

02:37:00.680 --> 02:37:02.760
She trusts me with these things.

02:37:03.120 --> 02:37:05.200
But if you only knew.

02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:07.560
When I heard, when you sat down with me.

02:37:07.560 --> 02:37:18.920
And I remember this one part where I freaked out because he said, she is such a strong woman to me as if I had endured something so horrendous by Veronica.

02:37:18.960 --> 02:37:24.120
And I almost was like, shoot, do I say like, oh, whoa, it's not that serious.

02:37:24.120 --> 02:37:30.600
Like, all I did was go pick up hair dye with her, you know, but then that would defeat, like, I don't want to disclose all of this.

02:37:30.600 --> 02:37:32.200
I'm not comfortable with sharing this.

02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:33.960
This has nothing to do with anything.

02:37:34.200 --> 02:37:41.840
And I remember picking up a baby wipe and being like, I don't know, like, my life is so hard being a mukbanger and like really trying to show him that,

02:37:42.080 --> 02:37:44.760
hey, I'm trying to get out of this conversation.

02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:47.040
Hey, I'm trying to get out of this conversation.

02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:50.920
And I did this pretty much almost every two sentences he gave.

02:37:51.200 --> 02:38:02.320
And increasingly, he looked at me with more and more shock on his face, as if he was shocked and angry at the fact that I refused to talk about what I told him in private.

02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:10.720
This whole ordeal paints Nick as manipulative, gaining trust and information, and then using it against Stephanie in an attempt to cause her to start drama.

02:38:10.720 --> 02:38:17.080
On top of all his comments, which state intent to expose a certain YouTuber, Stephanie felt frozen as to what to do.

02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:24.680
I was in this space at this point where I felt like anything will be used against me.

02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:33.240
And I felt like anything I say, even Nick's stop, he would use it and make an exposing video or threaten me with it.

02:38:33.240 --> 02:38:35.160
I don't know, I was just scared.

02:38:35.160 --> 02:38:37.280
Whoever I knew wasn't here anymore.

02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:39.320
I just felt like it wasn't the same Nick I knew.

02:38:39.320 --> 02:38:40.760
He knew that I was uncomfortable.

02:38:40.760 --> 02:38:43.400
He knew I didn't want to talk about this, but he kept going.

02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:49.880
And so at what point does my own comfort or does my feeling even matter to him?

02:38:49.880 --> 02:38:52.480
All I know is I was incredibly shaken up.

02:38:52.720 --> 02:38:56.720
And I just remember like, I didn't want to be in close proximity with him.

02:38:56.720 --> 02:39:02.240
And I was just kind of like standing off to the side and I didn't want to say anything.

02:39:02.240 --> 02:39:04.120
But I'm so nervous.

02:39:04.120 --> 02:39:05.440
Like, I don't know what to do.

02:39:05.440 --> 02:39:08.320
Oh, man, like, I wish I wish I didn't say that.

02:39:08.920 --> 02:39:14.480
I'm so nervous because I felt like if I said I'm uncomfortable or I'm scared or why did you do that?

02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:17.400
He would just get more and more increasingly angry with me.

02:39:18.120 --> 02:39:24.840
I had this feeling of I just need to do whatever I can to get through tonight and tomorrow

02:39:24.840 --> 02:39:31.760
because we have collab scheduled tomorrow and just be done with it because I don't want him to get angry.

02:39:31.760 --> 02:39:39.400
I don't want him to make a video using these words and trying to say all these things I said about Veronica.

02:39:39.520 --> 02:39:41.640
I just wanted to get through tonight.

02:39:41.640 --> 02:39:45.920
And that sounds crazy even to me, like me saying that right now.

02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:47.080
I sound crazy.

02:39:47.080 --> 02:39:49.280
Stephanie, you are 24.

02:39:49.280 --> 02:39:52.520
You should have got up and left, but I just couldn't.

02:39:52.520 --> 02:39:54.440
I was just so scared that I couldn't.

02:39:54.840 --> 02:39:59.400
These enduring issues leaked into the third video, although it was an ASMR video,

02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:02.480
she still felt uncomfortable and Nick's conduct persisted.

02:40:02.480 --> 02:40:07.120
This led to a lot of emotional stress after the session as she felt manipulated and exploited.

02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:10.520
This affected her sleep pattern, which disturbed the plans for the next day.

02:40:10.520 --> 02:40:14.320
She told Zach before messaging the group chat to inform Nick of her predicament.

02:40:14.320 --> 02:40:19.880
She then shares DMs, which seem to reinforce Stephanie's impression of Nick's behaviour as rather unpleasant.

02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:26.120
Stephanie is apologetic, but Nick rebukes this with hostility and is unsympathetic towards Stephanie's responses.

02:40:26.120 --> 02:40:30.440
In a way, he's upholding his previous points, but it seems very nasty.

02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:36.360
There are more DMs shown when Nick DMs her privately and channels frustrations about her messages to the group chat.

02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:40.480
Stephanie also shares the post Nick uploaded to his Instagram story and feed,

02:40:40.520 --> 02:40:46.960
and brings attention to the claims of audio clips, which Stephanie states made her anxious as she never consented to being recorded.

02:40:46.960 --> 02:40:52.520
She states that while investigating this, she found security footage of Nick taking multiple photos of her house,

02:40:52.520 --> 02:40:54.560
which she felt was violating her privacy.

02:40:55.000 --> 02:41:02.600
And the audio clips that he posted on his story and audio clips, I got alarmed because I felt weird about that.

02:41:02.600 --> 02:41:06.200
I never consented to any audio clips.

02:41:06.240 --> 02:41:10.480
So that means these were illegally recorded? When and where and how?

02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:15.320
I didn't know what he was talking about, I didn't know if this was just an empty threat to scare me even more,

02:41:16.440 --> 02:41:19.560
or if something happened that I don't know about.

02:41:19.560 --> 02:41:22.960
The only thing I can do is check what I have of security footage,

02:41:22.960 --> 02:41:26.360
and I went through all of Saturday when he was at my house.

02:41:26.360 --> 02:41:33.600
He was here for about five-ish hours, and out of those five hours that he was here, I used the restroom once.

02:41:34.240 --> 02:41:37.400
And during that time that I slipped away to the restroom very, very quickly,

02:41:37.400 --> 02:41:43.360
the one time that I did, without letting me know what he was doing, he took multiple pictures inside my house.

02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:47.080
And then immediately he started looking around at the ceiling.

02:41:47.080 --> 02:41:52.240
I didn't have any cool light fixtures up there, I just don't know what else would be up there other than security cameras.

02:41:52.240 --> 02:42:00.200
Seeing that footage was shattering and so angering because after everything that he made me feel safe enough to tell him about,

02:42:00.200 --> 02:42:05.640
I told him about the one thing that I don't talk to anyone about anymore.

02:42:05.640 --> 02:42:11.320
And I don't know if I would be this alarmed if throughout our entire interactions,

02:42:11.320 --> 02:42:17.840
I feel like he had never had any good or even harmless intentions with everything that he did.

02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:22.680
The way that he did it, during the five hours he was here, the minute that I slipped away to the restroom,

02:42:22.680 --> 02:42:29.280
you knew why I'm so paranoid, you know why I have such a hard time letting people into my home.

02:42:29.280 --> 02:42:34.440
It was a very violating feeling, and it was just something that I don't think I'll ever be able to understand.

02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:38.720
Now this is where it becomes more theoretical, because she shows clips from a deleted video,

02:42:38.720 --> 02:42:42.320
which she postulates could contribute to a pattern of predatory behaviour.

02:42:42.320 --> 02:42:42.820
Four.

02:42:42.820 --> 02:42:50.320
Five hours wasted was nice enough to say, I'll eat whatever the f*** you want to eat, because I'm gonna get f*** sucked.

02:42:50.320 --> 02:42:56.720
You know, like, okay, I'm gonna bend over because, you know, like, I'm gonna give you what you want,

02:42:56.720 --> 02:43:00.560
or I'm gonna get what I want, and nothing happened.

02:43:00.560 --> 02:43:02.680
Waiting to get my action.

02:43:02.680 --> 02:43:05.280
Well, no wonder, dude.

02:43:05.280 --> 02:43:06.400
You're a loser.

02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:20.440
But you have to understand where I'm coming from, too.

02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:23.320
But you have to understand where I'm coming from, too.

02:43:23.320 --> 02:43:26.240
I'm clearly signalling to you, I am ready.

02:43:26.240 --> 02:43:28.720
You are here for to be ready.

02:43:28.720 --> 02:43:33.480
I'm not going to just grab it, because you will come back, and it's gonna be the little me too movement.

02:43:33.480 --> 02:43:34.960
The little me too movement.

02:43:34.960 --> 02:43:37.520
He's not here to be ready for you.

02:43:37.520 --> 02:43:40.400
Nobody is here to be ready for you.

02:43:40.400 --> 02:43:42.600
And it's not the little me too movement.

02:43:42.600 --> 02:43:52.480
How dare you discredit an entire movement that the sole purpose was giving people a voice who didn't have a voice.

02:43:52.480 --> 02:44:01.240
How dare you discredit the entire thing that saved so many people because you had a bad day in New York City.

02:44:01.240 --> 02:44:03.160
The little me too movement.

02:44:03.160 --> 02:44:05.440
Oh, no one's going to believe you.

02:44:05.440 --> 02:44:08.480
No one's going to believe you because it was inappropriate.

02:44:08.480 --> 02:44:10.040
And that's why you didn't grab it.

02:44:10.040 --> 02:44:12.360
You didn't grab it because of the me too movement.

02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:15.200
You didn't grab it because there was a hashtag on Twitter.

02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:20.040
You didn't grab it because that's sexual assault if he didn't want you to.

02:44:20.040 --> 02:44:25.720
She talks more about her personal life, and why she believes her personal experiences affected her perspective,

02:44:25.720 --> 02:44:29.160
and although Stephanie acknowledges that it may seem trivial to some,

02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:32.920
she feels that her responses were justified given the environment that Nick created,

02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:36.120
and she felt particularly threatened by his demeanour and status,

02:44:36.120 --> 02:44:42.680
the latter which he had demonstrably exploited by creating a joke amongst his friends regarding her in and out of sleep comment,

02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:46.640
which she felt he had publicly used to intimidate and bully her.

02:44:47.080 --> 02:44:52.920
One of the biggest reasons I was even scared to make this video was because I knew that it looked stupid.

02:44:52.920 --> 02:44:55.920
Everything sounds dramatic.

02:44:55.920 --> 02:44:58.400
Oh, really? You were scared? Why did you stay?

02:44:58.400 --> 02:44:59.880
And there was nothing.

02:44:59.880 --> 02:45:02.160
Like, I felt like I had...

02:45:02.160 --> 02:45:10.360
I don't know why in any other situation nobody ever needs a reason to feel scared or unsafe or uncomfortable,

02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:12.400
but I felt like I needed to have a reason.

02:45:12.440 --> 02:45:17.880
And I didn't, and so I stayed, and I tried to make him less angry and not mad at me,

02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:19.440
and I was scared he was gonna say,

02:45:19.440 --> 02:45:22.800
then why did you stay if you were so scared after that?

02:45:22.800 --> 02:45:27.600
There's just been a lot of online bullying, and I'm someone that...

02:45:27.600 --> 02:45:29.120
I've been through high school bullying.

02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:31.640
I talk about it a lot more on my other channel.

02:45:31.640 --> 02:45:34.560
He knows it. I've talked about it with him before.

02:45:34.560 --> 02:45:40.360
It just was a gross abuse of power and an abuse of his platform and his voice.

02:45:40.360 --> 02:45:43.960
At first, I felt, again, like more shame and embarrassment

02:45:43.960 --> 02:45:47.920
because a lot of the people that he tagged are people that he knew that I would say,

02:45:47.920 --> 02:45:50.960
oh my God, I've watched her since high school, or oh, I love her, you know?

02:45:50.960 --> 02:45:52.600
I did a collab with her.

02:45:52.600 --> 02:45:55.120
And these are people that I respected.

02:45:55.120 --> 02:45:59.600
I don't wanna believe that they know the full story of what he's done.

02:45:59.600 --> 02:46:03.920
I also felt scared because now it felt like if I say something,

02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:05.760
it's not just going up against Nick,

02:46:05.760 --> 02:46:08.160
but look at all the friends he has.

02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:11.840
Who do I have?

02:46:11.840 --> 02:46:14.360
And I just felt like I couldn't say anything

02:46:14.360 --> 02:46:18.640
because it would be going up against all of these people and...

02:46:18.640 --> 02:46:20.920
I was telling them a story about someone who...

02:46:20.920 --> 02:46:23.400
Something happened, someone did something to me,

02:46:23.400 --> 02:46:27.040
and there was just a lot that broke my spirits.

02:46:27.040 --> 02:46:28.640
Or I'm gonna get what I want.

02:46:30.640 --> 02:46:31.960
And I was telling them the story,

02:46:31.960 --> 02:46:36.680
and one of the inside joke from that story was in and out of sleep.

02:46:36.680 --> 02:46:39.640
And you don't understand, but then I told a few other YouTubers,

02:46:39.640 --> 02:46:42.520
I tagged them on Instagram, as well as my friends,

02:46:42.520 --> 02:46:45.440
and they all know, I was like...

02:46:45.440 --> 02:46:47.200
They know the story, and they...

02:46:47.200 --> 02:46:48.200
The...

02:46:51.800 --> 02:46:54.200
The major thing that they take away from that was the in and out of sleep.

02:46:54.200 --> 02:46:56.160
In and out of sleep.

02:46:56.160 --> 02:46:59.440
I've just been in and out of sleep, and I don't know what's going on,

02:46:59.440 --> 02:47:01.040
but you know, I got things to do.

02:47:01.040 --> 02:47:03.480
I just got, ah, I got things to do!

02:47:03.480 --> 02:47:05.280
Have you been in and out of sleep?

02:47:05.280 --> 02:47:07.600
In and out of sleep, oh my gosh.

02:47:07.600 --> 02:47:09.840
In and out of sleep right now.

02:47:09.840 --> 02:47:11.560
They're like, what the f...

02:47:11.560 --> 02:47:14.960
That's the most obnoxious, bizarre thing I've ever heard, like, what the...

02:47:26.080 --> 02:47:28.720
In and out of sleep, we turned something that really bothered me

02:47:28.720 --> 02:47:32.720
into something that we can laugh about when we were at the club.

02:47:32.720 --> 02:47:36.920
I'm telling you, I should have put this on YouTube, on YouTube,

02:47:36.960 --> 02:47:40.040
but also, I mean, it's just, you have to laugh about things to get over things.

02:47:40.040 --> 02:47:41.880
That's just how, what I believe.

02:47:41.880 --> 02:47:45.080
She says that she'll be producing merchandise based around this joke

02:47:45.080 --> 02:47:49.480
with the proceeds going to charity, and she finishes on this message.

02:47:49.480 --> 02:47:52.960
One of the things that really stood out was the word audacity.

02:47:52.960 --> 02:47:55.400
You won't believe the audacity people have,

02:47:55.400 --> 02:47:57.880
but I have lots of receipts and audio clips.

02:47:57.880 --> 02:48:01.680
The definition of audacity means rude or disrespectful behavior.

02:48:01.680 --> 02:48:05.440
I know that Nick is really offended because I was being really rude

02:48:05.480 --> 02:48:09.080
and self-serving, and I had the audacity to do a lot of things,

02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:13.000
and I just want to apologize that I had the audacity to say no to you

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:14.200
because I felt unsafe.

02:48:14.200 --> 02:48:18.800
I'm sorry that I had the audacity to open my doors and let you into my home,

02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:20.200
and then you took advantage of that,

02:48:20.200 --> 02:48:23.920
and I'm sorry that I had the audacity to make you feel like I changed my mind,

02:48:23.920 --> 02:48:27.720
but I think it's really important that we all know that a yes is not all-inclusive.

02:48:27.720 --> 02:48:31.680
Just because you say yes doesn't mean you're saying yes to everything

02:48:31.680 --> 02:48:32.800
for the rest of forever.

02:48:32.800 --> 02:48:35.480
That's incredibly predatory and manipulative.

02:48:35.480 --> 02:48:37.320
What was the purpose of all of this?

02:48:37.900 --> 02:48:39.120
To hurt Veronica?

02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:40.520
To hurt me?

02:48:41.400 --> 02:48:42.800
To get your dick sucked?

02:48:42.800 --> 02:48:46.040
This was a devastating video for Nick in multiple capacities,

02:48:46.040 --> 02:48:49.680
and although I'd heard mixed things about the video from the commentary sphere,

02:48:49.680 --> 02:48:52.200
a few reservations we'll talk about in a moment aside,

02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:53.360
it was effective.

02:48:53.360 --> 02:48:55.120
With the observations made about Nick,

02:48:55.120 --> 02:48:59.280
a lot of the behavior was completely in line of what many could previously observe,

02:48:59.280 --> 02:49:01.760
and even without Stephanie's personal commentary,

02:49:01.760 --> 02:49:03.960
it was hard to provide Nick with much magnanimity.

02:49:03.960 --> 02:49:06.600
But hey, we had Nick's side around the corner,

02:49:06.600 --> 02:49:09.840
maybe he'd be able to give himself an out.

02:49:10.240 --> 02:49:15.400
All right, I have screenshots, I have photos, I have audio clips,

02:49:15.400 --> 02:49:21.840
I have various pieces of the story that Stephanie decided to leave out of hers.

02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:25.560
With that much evidence, what could go wrong?

02:49:31.760 --> 02:49:36.560
INTRO

02:49:36.560 --> 02:49:41.000
Stephanie's video was slightly harder to traverse than it may initially appear,

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:44.240
because some of the content is based on personal sentiment,

02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:48.680
a lot of people just interpreted that personal sentiment with a particular harshness towards Nick,

02:49:48.680 --> 02:49:53.000
due to the depiction of him in the situation and his pattern of previous behavior.

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:56.080
I'll dissect the whole that Nick dug himself into in a minute,

02:49:56.080 --> 02:49:58.080
let's talk about the shovel he used to get there.

02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:01.120
With the response video, you can generally go for two points,

02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:04.920
you can make your perspective seem justified, a more achievable goal,

02:50:04.920 --> 02:50:08.360
but if you're feeling extra spicy, like some nuclear noodles,

02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:11.640
then you can make your detractors perspective seem unjustified,

02:50:11.640 --> 02:50:13.600
and thus bring into question their intent.

02:50:13.600 --> 02:50:15.920
However, if you went for the latter and failed,

02:50:15.920 --> 02:50:18.760
it would likely jeopardize your own character even further.

02:50:19.120 --> 02:50:23.880
In the video that is 1 hour 36 minutes, please end my suffering,

02:50:23.880 --> 02:50:25.600
he rebuts Stephanie's points,

02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:29.440
but not with the concise nature that he might have been previously renowned for.

02:50:29.480 --> 02:50:33.760
Nick may have been smart, but he was a naturally calculated person,

02:50:33.760 --> 02:50:39.360
and as noted with other dramas, often had trouble adapting to evolving circumstances.

02:50:39.360 --> 02:50:42.000
The only reason he'd kept his head above water previously,

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.520
is because people didn't really ask enough questions,

02:50:44.520 --> 02:50:48.560
but now he was under the microscope, a lot of his faults became clear.

02:50:48.920 --> 02:50:53.280
The first mistake Nick makes is by removing the context from their relative points,

02:50:53.280 --> 02:50:57.080
he decides to open the video by talking about the photos in her house,

02:50:57.080 --> 02:51:00.800
and although a rather strange decision considering it's position in Stephanie's video,

02:51:00.800 --> 02:51:04.160
it may be because it's one of the points he has a stronger rebuttal to.

02:51:04.160 --> 02:51:09.040
Nick- There's no, no excuse to be taking photos of someone's home without their permission.

02:51:09.040 --> 02:51:12.080
Why would you be taking photos? That's creepy, that's stalkerish.

02:51:12.080 --> 02:51:14.760
Are you dangerous? Are you going to break in and steal a lamp?

02:51:14.760 --> 02:51:17.800
Are you going to leak her? Why would you take photos?

02:51:17.800 --> 02:51:21.280
And in Stephanie's video, she implied, well she said,

02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:24.040
that she had gone to the bathroom, she used the restroom,

02:51:24.440 --> 02:51:29.000
and when she came back, she had checked the security footage to see that I was taking photos of her house

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:34.360
without her knowledge, and therefore it made her question her safety,

02:51:34.360 --> 02:51:41.280
the overall peace of mind in her home, and that's a lie, that is 100% a lie.

02:51:41.280 --> 02:51:44.160
But even then, he's already giving erroneous facts,

02:51:44.160 --> 02:51:48.240
in that clip he states that she checked the security footage after she used the restroom,

02:51:48.240 --> 02:51:50.880
I'm not sure if that's intentional misinformation,

02:51:50.920 --> 02:51:56.880
but she checked the security footage after Nick posted on his Instagram story about having a load of audio receipts,

02:51:56.880 --> 02:51:59.120
which Stephanie stated she didn't know about.

02:51:59.120 --> 02:52:02.520
Those are relevant details that are necessary to discerning intent.

02:52:02.520 --> 02:52:07.000
Now Nick has strong grounds to defend his intent on this point, on principle.

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:12.200
Nick- And she's claiming that I was taking photos for an odd reason,

02:52:12.200 --> 02:52:16.680
that she has no idea what it was for, and that's what made her feel unsafe,

02:52:16.680 --> 02:52:20.680
but she was sitting right there as I took a photo, watching me.

02:52:20.720 --> 02:52:24.480
In spite of Stephanie's DMs from November, which did show tangible anxiety,

02:52:24.480 --> 02:52:28.880
it could be easy to forget, and this could have been chalked up to miscommunication.

02:52:28.880 --> 02:52:34.600
Unfortunately, because Nick removes the context, and goes in with the claim that Stephanie was just telling a bare-faced lie,

02:52:34.600 --> 02:52:36.600
it feels inherently mean-spirited.

02:52:36.600 --> 02:52:42.200
Nick- What she's saying here is so incriminating, she's making it look like I did something without her knowledge,

02:52:42.200 --> 02:52:48.360
that therefore threatened her peace of mind, or implied the overall safety of her home was in jeopardy.

02:52:48.360 --> 02:52:53.160
Stephanie, you painted the stage for your viewers, that you had no idea I was taking photos,

02:52:53.160 --> 02:52:56.160
and that was the reason you were questioning your safety.

02:52:56.160 --> 02:52:58.160
That's the only thing you supposedly had on me.

02:52:58.160 --> 02:53:01.560
Was it really the only thing she had on you? Think about this, Nick.

02:53:01.560 --> 02:53:04.760
In fact, the first five minutes were just an uncomfortable viewing,

02:53:04.760 --> 02:53:07.560
because Nick goes into it with the most cynical outlook.

02:53:07.560 --> 02:53:11.960
And you knew that probably wasn't enough to emotionally sway everybody,

02:53:11.960 --> 02:53:18.360
which is why you made half of your video discussing sexual assault, PTSD, the Me Too movement,

02:53:18.360 --> 02:53:21.160
all of which have nothing to do with our collaboration.

02:53:21.160 --> 02:53:26.760
It is so ethically wrong to insinuate that I was taking photos while you were in the bathroom,

02:53:26.760 --> 02:53:30.160
and you had no idea as to why that was the case.

02:53:30.160 --> 02:53:34.560
That is deliberate manipulation in order to sell a story.

02:53:34.560 --> 02:53:37.960
Now, I'd spoken about Nick's habit to make things about himself before.

02:53:37.960 --> 02:53:41.960
If we look past the rhetorical hyperbole of half of the video being about Stephanie's experience

02:53:41.960 --> 02:53:46.760
when it takes up a significantly smaller amount, for someone so switched onto arguments and their premises,

02:53:46.760 --> 02:53:50.360
he seems to completely neglect the fact that this video isn't just about his behaviour,

02:53:50.360 --> 02:53:55.360
but equally how Stephanie interpreted his behaviour more dramatically due to her personal history.

02:53:55.360 --> 02:54:00.360
Now, you can challenge its purpose as a formative point, or the frequency that it is used,

02:54:00.360 --> 02:54:05.360
but you can't say that it's irrelevant because she directly draws parallels between coercive elements

02:54:05.360 --> 02:54:09.160
of Nick's behaviour and her experience which explains her adverse reaction.

02:54:09.160 --> 02:54:13.960
Stephanie also states that it's information that she disclosed to Nick, which provides the implication

02:54:13.960 --> 02:54:18.560
that he had been insensitive to her experiences while making her visibly uncomfortable.

02:54:18.560 --> 02:54:23.360
Her video is justifying her reaction as much as it is condemning Nick's action,

02:54:23.360 --> 02:54:26.760
because she seems aware that it could come off as an overreaction.

02:54:26.760 --> 02:54:30.960
This is something that Nick has done before himself, and this is relevant because Nick was threatening

02:54:30.960 --> 02:54:35.160
to upload content where he presented his own context for Stephanie's behaviour,

02:54:35.160 --> 02:54:39.760
a context probably much more negative. Understood? Jesus.

02:54:39.760 --> 02:54:46.160
I wasn't looking around for suspicious things, I was admiring her furniture, admiring her,

02:54:46.160 --> 02:54:50.960
and she says I don't have fancy light fixtures. I'm sorry, that's the first house I've been in that looks like that.

02:54:50.960 --> 02:54:55.960
This is a multi-million dollar home. I was impressed, I was happy for you,

02:54:55.960 --> 02:55:03.560
and I think you were happy to show it off to me. That shouldn't be used as material as to why you felt threatened by me.

02:55:03.560 --> 02:55:05.560
Absolutely not.

02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:10.760
Now, with that said, he has a reasonable explanation for why he took those photos on principle,

02:55:10.760 --> 02:55:16.360
but the problem is he goes in so harshly against Stephanie that it's an immediate turn off for a lot of audiences,

02:55:16.360 --> 02:55:22.960
even if he had a point to make. Stephanie Sue's video worked off the straightforward structure of some of the best exposés,

02:55:23.160 --> 02:55:30.160
some of Nick's own exposés. Go in with a high burden of proof, make it seem like you did your best to deal with the situation professionally,

02:55:30.160 --> 02:55:36.160
and eventually show the attrition of that mentality that pushes you past the threshold for passive acceptance.

02:55:36.160 --> 02:55:40.760
Why would you lie about something like that? I don't understand, why would you lie about it?

02:55:40.760 --> 02:55:45.360
I even took a selfie, I even took a selfie, look at me, and I sent it to my husband.

02:55:45.360 --> 02:55:49.960
Oh, oh, and let me play you, let me play you what I sent to my husband.

02:55:49.960 --> 02:55:55.560
Here's a screenshot of Orlin watching us do the house tour. Look, I'm literally pointing toward the couch.

02:55:55.560 --> 02:56:00.160
This is innocent stuff, this was like fellowship, this was conversation.

02:56:00.160 --> 02:56:04.560
Oh, look at my house, look at my sofa, where's it from? It looks beautiful. Orlin says, oh, I love it.

02:56:04.560 --> 02:56:09.960
You know, we are YouTubers too, it's not like I'm the milkman coming to rob a lamp from her.

02:56:09.960 --> 02:56:13.760
That's the thing, Nick seems so angry and it feels completely misplaced.

02:56:13.760 --> 02:56:18.560
It's not like you couldn't have a point here, but Nick fails to include the context for Stephanie's point,

02:56:18.560 --> 02:56:22.760
why she may feel uncomfortable around someone taking photos while she's not there.

02:56:22.760 --> 02:56:27.160
His paraphrasing is weak, sometimes inaccurate, and his failure to account for context,

02:56:27.160 --> 02:56:31.160
and even Stephanie's premise makes his anger seem excessive and unreasonable.

02:56:31.160 --> 02:56:36.160
I don't think Stephanie's point is that strong on this run, but I also acknowledge that you could find it unnerving

02:56:36.160 --> 02:56:40.360
that the one occasion that someone leaves the room unattended in the space of five hours,

02:56:40.360 --> 02:56:46.360
a person decides to take pictures. I will add that Stephanie has repeatedly stated that she has the footage to share,

02:56:46.360 --> 02:56:50.560
but as California is a two-party consent state, she would need explicit permission,

02:56:50.560 --> 02:56:52.960
something that Nick didn't provide in this video.

02:56:52.960 --> 02:56:55.960
It's not like I walked into her house like this.

02:57:00.960 --> 02:57:06.560
Nick did talk about what you would see if she did release the footage, but that's not the same as explicit consent.

02:57:06.560 --> 02:57:11.960
Nick knows how easy it would have been to be clear, so it leaves us speculating about what happened,

02:57:11.960 --> 02:57:16.160
as much as it leaves us speculating about why Nick didn't provide consent.

02:57:16.160 --> 02:57:21.360
This is how he set the tone for the video, and little spoiler, it doesn't get better.

02:57:21.360 --> 02:57:26.360
And Stephanie is saying that I'm pressuring her to talk about what happened.

02:57:26.360 --> 02:57:30.560
She's saying that she would never want to bring her up, she never brought her up before,

02:57:30.560 --> 02:57:32.960
and she said quote, I'd have no reason to.

02:57:32.960 --> 02:57:38.160
Pro tip Nick, when you say quote, it's typically meant to follow with an actual quote.

02:57:38.160 --> 02:57:43.360
Over the next one and a half hours, Nick pretty much fumbles every point, and he does it for many reasons.

02:57:43.360 --> 02:57:49.760
There's no real way to summarise this video, it's a disorganised mess, and to be honest, I expected better from Nick.

02:57:49.760 --> 02:57:53.960
He goes off on multiple tangents and vague arguments which prove very little,

02:57:53.960 --> 02:57:59.360
particularly in the second half, but I'll try and focus now on a few key points, and what they can tell us.

02:57:59.360 --> 02:58:03.760
She wants her viewers to think she'd never take part in a discussion about Veronica,

02:58:03.760 --> 02:58:11.160
while she forgot to mention and show in her text messages that she asked us, me and Zach,

02:58:11.160 --> 02:58:17.760
to take part in a multi-video documentary about Veronica Wang, Shane Dawson style.

02:58:17.760 --> 02:58:19.160
Let me read you what she said.

02:58:19.160 --> 02:58:23.960
This is at the end of August, a couple of months ago, three or four months ago, and this is what she said.

02:58:23.960 --> 02:58:30.360
So essentially, I want to address everything that she did that hurt everybody involved, starting from Shookbang,

02:58:30.360 --> 02:58:33.760
and maybe finally get her to understand that she wasn't the victim here.

02:58:33.760 --> 02:58:37.960
And I would also like to showcase a side of you that shows you're not just here for the drama,

02:58:37.960 --> 02:58:43.160
but you're here for the underdogs, and the words she said against you hurt you, and not just angered you.

02:58:43.160 --> 02:58:47.760
I would also like people to see a glimpse of vulnerability from Nikocado, obviously to your comfort.

02:58:47.760 --> 02:58:52.160
I was just hoping to be an unbiased voice. It honestly seems like a little much.

02:58:52.160 --> 02:58:55.760
I don't live there, I'd have to fly there, and if anything, a Shane Dawson documentary,

02:58:55.760 --> 02:59:00.160
that's many different days of filming and shooting. I'm not really interested in spending weeks there for this.

02:59:00.360 --> 02:59:04.360
Yeah, a collab where we eat and chat, but that's different than a documentary.

02:59:04.360 --> 02:59:09.360
It would be hard for you, Stephanie, to be that unbiased voice, considering you were Veronica's friend,

02:59:09.360 --> 02:59:12.960
and it was your own videos that started Shookbang making videos,

02:59:12.960 --> 02:59:17.560
as well as the supposed advice you gave to Veronica to delete them.

02:59:17.560 --> 02:59:23.360
Like at this point in time, no one even knows you stopped being friends, or that she treated you so poorly.

02:59:23.360 --> 02:59:29.160
So we'll come across to the viewers as you trying to bring her back to being liked by everyone again, which could backfire.

02:59:29.160 --> 02:59:33.160
She never even apologized to you, or anybody, so I don't think it's a good idea, just my thoughts.

02:59:33.160 --> 02:59:37.160
As I noted, Nik has trouble adapting, and this situation was no exception.

02:59:37.160 --> 02:59:42.160
A lot of his responses fell flat because it felt like they were prepared for a completely different video.

02:59:42.160 --> 02:59:47.560
Following the apartment issue, he goes in on the point regarding Stephanie's willingness to talk about Veronica.

02:59:47.560 --> 02:59:51.960
He first says that Stephanie wanted to do a docuseries in August about Veronica,

02:59:51.960 --> 02:59:56.760
and then spends a few minutes going through receipts from three and a half months prior to the situation.

02:59:56.760 --> 03:00:00.760
He then talks about how much she spoke about the situation when they first met.

03:00:00.760 --> 03:00:05.760
Can I tell you, when I first met Stephanie Sue out for dinner, we were there for what, like four, five, six hours?

03:00:05.760 --> 03:00:11.760
Do you think we were talking about the weather, talking about how to make an omelet, talking about what our favorite designer bag is?

03:00:11.760 --> 03:00:22.560
It was Stephanie Sue going on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on about all of this stuff between her and Veronica.

03:00:22.560 --> 03:00:27.960
I didn't even ask her. Zach didn't even ask her. She was, boom, vomiting it out.

03:00:27.960 --> 03:00:33.560
She had this boiling up, like she says, looming over her heads. It's still looming over her head then,

03:00:33.560 --> 03:00:39.560
and let me tell you, when I just two weeks ago was in Los Angeles, it was still looming over her head then too,

03:00:39.560 --> 03:00:40.560
and I'm gonna get into that.

03:00:40.560 --> 03:00:46.560
All of this seems rather irrelevant to be honest, and not satisfied, he then goes through his DMs with Zach Choi

03:00:46.560 --> 03:00:51.560
around that time of the situation, where Zach voices his skepticism of Stephanie's intentions,

03:00:51.560 --> 03:00:55.560
and then shares Zach's DMs with Stephanie, where she says she'd love to involve him.

03:00:55.560 --> 03:01:01.560
And this is something else that pervades the video, this excruciating matter of fact tone, like he's spilling some tea,

03:01:01.560 --> 03:01:06.560
but a lot of the time, he's missing the mark so badly, it's painful to watch.

03:01:06.560 --> 03:01:12.560
It doesn't help that a lot of this content was months before, and one of the key takeaways you could draw from Stephanie's video

03:01:12.560 --> 03:01:15.560
is that people are allowed to change their mind.

03:01:15.560 --> 03:01:21.560
I could talk about how a docuseries with said person is very different to talking crap about them in a Mukbang video,

03:01:21.560 --> 03:01:23.560
but I feel that would be overkill.

03:01:23.560 --> 03:01:29.560
All I'll say is that one has a much stronger ability to start drama, the other has a much stronger ability to end it.

03:01:29.560 --> 03:01:34.560
And then Zach's like, yeah, I'll be dead, or if I disagree with her, and then Zach says,

03:01:34.560 --> 03:01:40.560
I feel like Stephanie is trying to get involved in the drama without being involved in the drama.

03:01:40.560 --> 03:01:43.560
When she pitched the idea to me earlier, it threw me way off.

03:01:43.560 --> 03:01:45.560
Let me repeat that to you again.

03:01:45.560 --> 03:01:51.560
I feel like Stephanie is trying to get involved in the drama without being involved in the drama.

03:01:51.560 --> 03:01:56.560
And then he sent me a screenshot, a screenshot of his text messages with Stephanie.

03:01:56.560 --> 03:02:02.560
And this is what it says, Zach says to Stephanie, it's really up to Nick since I wasn't even involved to begin with.

03:02:02.560 --> 03:02:06.560
And then Stephanie goes, I think I'm going to do it regardless.

03:02:06.560 --> 03:02:09.560
This is someone who's saying, what did she say? I would never want to talk about her.

03:02:09.560 --> 03:02:12.560
Nothing even happened. Nick's trying to start something out of nowhere.

03:02:12.560 --> 03:02:17.560
This lady has so much upset feelings against Veronica Wang.

03:02:17.560 --> 03:02:23.560
And let me tell you, it's a lot more than just pink hair dye that she was willing to make a Shane Dawson documentary.

03:02:23.560 --> 03:02:27.560
Four part, two part, five part series hours long.

03:02:27.560 --> 03:02:30.560
You think people make documentaries over hair dye?

03:02:31.560 --> 03:02:40.560
Stephanie Sue was still so, so upset about Veronica Wang that she was willing to make a documentary about it,

03:02:40.560 --> 03:02:47.560
a documentary, and stick Zach in there too for clicks, capitalising on something and opportunistic.

03:02:47.560 --> 03:02:51.560
Reading through Stephanie's DMs about the idea, accepting that it might be opportunistic,

03:02:51.560 --> 03:02:54.560
it mostly seems like an innocent attempt to resolve drama.

03:02:54.560 --> 03:02:57.560
She certainly presents it as that, and then Nick brings in these DMs,

03:02:57.560 --> 03:03:01.560
like him talking trash with someone else about a person is evidence.

03:03:01.560 --> 03:03:06.560
The DMs themselves involve Nick and Zach agreeing that Stephanie is trying to give Veronica an out,

03:03:06.560 --> 03:03:13.560
while Nick uses it as evidence to show that Stephanie would want to drag Veronica in an unrelated milk bank session.

03:03:13.560 --> 03:03:21.560
I felt like I would never tell him that I wanted to talk about Veronica and specifically spill the tea.

03:03:21.560 --> 03:03:25.560
It had always been about Shukbang. Me and Veronica's relationship didn't involve Nick.

03:03:25.560 --> 03:03:28.560
Once again, I have to be the one to actually show clips in Nick's favour.

03:03:28.560 --> 03:03:33.560
Now, I think Stephanie could have been a bit more upfront regarding her previous propositions,

03:03:33.560 --> 03:03:39.560
however, Nick's evidence here would only explain why he may have brought it up once, before Stephanie allegedly rebuffed him.

03:03:39.560 --> 03:03:43.560
Another text I'd like to show is a couple weeks later, on September 10th, I said,

03:03:43.560 --> 03:03:46.560
and Stephanie is so slow at communication that I'm not going to pursue it anymore.

03:03:46.560 --> 03:03:50.560
I don't want to be an annoying Kim texting her over and over, lol.

03:03:50.560 --> 03:03:54.560
When she doesn't respond to me, I can take it as a clear indication that she's not interested.

03:03:54.560 --> 03:03:59.560
She managed to look at her phone to get the appearance on Belove's channel, despite her busy move,

03:03:59.560 --> 03:04:01.560
so it's not like she isn't on her phone.

03:04:01.560 --> 03:04:04.560
And then Zach goes, yeah, I don't know what's going on with Stephanie.

03:04:04.560 --> 03:04:07.560
I wonder who her actual friends are, lol.

03:04:07.560 --> 03:04:13.560
The only point here that could be noted is that it's an appeal to Zach Choi's authority and neutrality,

03:04:13.560 --> 03:04:15.560
but as we'll see, that soon backfired.

03:04:15.560 --> 03:04:21.560
What people see of Stephanie Su on the internet is not the Stephanie Su that people off camera know her as.

03:04:21.560 --> 03:04:25.560
That's also why people are probably uncomfortable with me, because I tell it like it is.

03:04:25.560 --> 03:04:29.560
If I'm mean, if I'm an asshole, if I'm soaking up the drama because I like it, people already know that.

03:04:29.560 --> 03:04:31.560
There's no sequence there, I tell ya.

03:04:31.560 --> 03:04:36.560
But with Stephanie, her image, her persona on the internet is very like, I'm unproblematic.

03:04:36.560 --> 03:04:39.560
I don't like to take part. I don't talk ill will on anybody.

03:04:39.560 --> 03:04:41.560
When that's exactly what she's doing off camera.

03:04:41.560 --> 03:04:45.560
Wow, people online are not the same people that they are offline.

03:04:45.560 --> 03:04:49.560
The tea is truly scolding, Nick Ocado, I know, I know, I'm just fed up.

03:04:49.560 --> 03:04:52.560
Unfortunately, nothing he really says here is particularly helpful.

03:04:52.560 --> 03:04:57.560
The confusing thing is that there's not really much argument between what happened for most of the story,

03:04:57.560 --> 03:05:00.560
they just talk about different stories that occasionally overlap,

03:05:00.560 --> 03:05:05.560
and Nick acts like he's caught her out, which just ends up being the commentary equivalent of an awkward silence.

03:05:05.560 --> 03:05:09.560
Later on the video, he shares more voice recordings with Carly Steele,

03:05:09.560 --> 03:05:12.560
another friend of his, over Stephanie's claim that she felt uncomfortable.

03:05:12.560 --> 03:05:16.560
She did provide permission, though I'm confused as to why.

03:05:16.560 --> 03:05:21.560
In Stephanie's video, she says that she had to film all these videos, she had to do three videos,

03:05:21.560 --> 03:05:26.560
we filmed one, and she had to keep pushing through, she was uncomfortable, she didn't know how to say no.

03:05:26.560 --> 03:05:32.560
She eluded and insinuated that she was there by the way of me and my requests.

03:05:32.560 --> 03:05:38.560
What she forgot to tell you was the truth, and the truth was, we were there because she asked us to be.

03:05:38.560 --> 03:05:43.560
That was not in our schedule. Stephanie Sue invites herself into my collab with Zach.

03:05:43.560 --> 03:05:47.560
She invites herself into it. That was not for her, it wasn't for her to be there,

03:05:47.560 --> 03:05:51.560
and she did it over FaceTime while I was standing in Jollibee.

03:05:51.560 --> 03:05:53.560
Hey, so you know how I did my collab with Zach yesterday?

03:05:53.560 --> 03:05:56.560
Well, today was supposed to be our collab for my video, for my channel.

03:05:56.560 --> 03:05:59.560
Well, Stephanie Sue just like invited herself into it.

03:05:59.560 --> 03:06:01.560
So this is exactly what I was afraid would happen.

03:06:01.560 --> 03:06:05.560
That's so f***ing rude, and like, the thing is too is you called it, like you f***ing knew, you knew.

03:06:05.560 --> 03:06:11.560
It seems like, yeah, like she's just really f***ing selfish, and what's shitty is like they put you in an uncomfortable position

03:06:11.560 --> 03:06:14.560
because they FaceTimed you with like both of you together and that puts you in an uncomfortable situation

03:06:14.560 --> 03:06:16.560
because you can't say no, you look bad.

03:06:16.560 --> 03:06:22.560
It's kind of like I think she knew what she was doing, she seems very manipulative, like manipulating her way into people's heads.

03:06:22.560 --> 03:06:27.560
So that's the truth. I didn't pressure her to be there, I didn't pressure her into filming really late at night

03:06:27.560 --> 03:06:33.560
where she was uncomfortable and she's never been out that late, and that is just not the truth.

03:06:33.560 --> 03:06:36.560
Once again, I'm really confused as to the point of this.

03:06:36.560 --> 03:06:38.560
Carly Steele has never spoken to Stephanie.

03:06:38.560 --> 03:06:42.560
The conflict appears to have occurred in the morning before the Veronica Wang situation,

03:06:42.560 --> 03:06:46.560
at which point Stephanie stated she didn't see any alarming issues.

03:06:46.560 --> 03:06:49.560
There was a lot of filming and a lot of eating that day, and the first video went really well.

03:06:49.560 --> 03:06:52.560
So obviously, I don't know if she's comfortable with being on the phone or not,

03:06:52.560 --> 03:06:55.560
but I feel like an apology over the phone and talking things out over the phone

03:06:55.560 --> 03:06:59.560
is a lot more like genuine and like down to earth than just like messaging her and be like,

03:07:00.560 --> 03:07:03.560
But I do owe her an apology, and I owe everyone here an apology,

03:07:03.560 --> 03:07:05.560
especially the people that think of me differently.

03:07:05.560 --> 03:07:09.560
So I guess that that was my bad for commenting on a situation I didn't know about.

03:07:09.560 --> 03:07:12.560
I definitely shouldn't have said like the whole, I don't know who raised her thing

03:07:12.560 --> 03:07:15.560
because that was really out of line and really out of character for me,

03:07:15.560 --> 03:07:17.560
and I don't know why the fuck I said that, and I'm very sorry.

03:07:17.560 --> 03:07:20.560
I guess I was just trying to be as mad as Nick was.

03:07:20.560 --> 03:07:23.560
I don't know, like I don't know, I don't know why I said that,

03:07:23.560 --> 03:07:27.560
and it's like really disrespectful and kind of disgusting of me to say that, and I'll take the L on that.

03:07:27.560 --> 03:07:31.560
I definitely am not bullying her in any way. I have never called her like names.

03:07:31.560 --> 03:07:33.560
I've never been like, you're a bitch or like whatever.

03:07:33.560 --> 03:07:36.560
I have not sent any of my fans to hit on her.

03:07:36.560 --> 03:07:40.560
I was just someone that was kind of in the background hearing one side.

03:07:40.560 --> 03:07:45.560
Carly Steele went on to apologise to Stephanie after audio clips were dropped in Nick's video,

03:07:45.560 --> 03:07:49.560
and I'm still wondering what Nick expected, including these clips would prove.

03:07:49.560 --> 03:07:54.560
Even if the situation was relevant, trash talk doesn't prove it happened the way you portrayed it,

03:07:54.560 --> 03:08:00.560
and your friend has no stake in that situation, you've just unnecessarily dragged them in too.

03:08:00.560 --> 03:08:04.560
It feels like Nick was trying to name drop people to encourage them to come to his side,

03:08:04.560 --> 03:08:06.560
but it practically had the opposite effect,

03:08:06.560 --> 03:08:11.560
because a fair few people that he involved just seemed completely allergic to being involved in actual drama.

03:08:11.560 --> 03:08:16.560
Zach Choi is one of those people who repeatedly requested Nick to leave him out of the drama.

03:08:16.560 --> 03:08:22.560
He had even made a public statement committing to neutrality, which angered a fair few of his fans at the time.

03:08:22.560 --> 03:08:27.560
However, as we've observed, Nick was particularly keen to include his character judgments on Stephanie Sue,

03:08:27.560 --> 03:08:30.560
once again appearing like a ham-fisted appeal to authority.

03:08:30.560 --> 03:08:33.560
When Nick dropped the DMs without Zach's permission,

03:08:33.560 --> 03:08:37.560
Zach snapped, and released a statement criticising Nick for not consulting him,

03:08:37.560 --> 03:08:42.560
and releasing DMs of his own, which show Nick allegedly attempting to coerce a position out of Zach.

03:08:42.560 --> 03:08:47.560
A lot of the DMs show Nick advocating for information that the other person appears to not be aware of,

03:08:48.560 --> 03:08:51.560
and then those friends trusting Nick with that information,

03:08:51.560 --> 03:08:55.560
and then Nick using that trust as evidence for why his portrayal must be accurate.

03:08:55.560 --> 03:09:00.560
Nick's behaviour seemed to show the valued winning the fight more than the trust of many of his own friends,

03:09:00.560 --> 03:09:05.560
and in turn pushing them away, by releasing DMs without consultation at all.

03:09:05.560 --> 03:09:09.560
What makes this worse is that a lot of the DMs don't even seem particularly relevant,

03:09:09.560 --> 03:09:11.560
other than providing character judgments,

03:09:11.560 --> 03:09:14.560
one from a person that knows Stephanie from Nick's own comments,

03:09:14.560 --> 03:09:17.560
and one from a person who has renounced those statements.

03:09:17.560 --> 03:09:21.560
It felt like he was trying to justify why he didn't like Stephanie,

03:09:21.560 --> 03:09:23.560
and that was one of the greatest failures of the video,

03:09:27.560 --> 03:09:29.560
because it wasn't just why he didn't like Stephanie,

03:09:29.560 --> 03:09:35.560
he shows these DMs, and spouts this rhetoric which gives the impression that he never liked Stephanie,

03:09:35.560 --> 03:09:39.560
which brings into question why on Earth he had appeared to befriend her in the first place.

03:09:39.560 --> 03:09:44.560
She's very self-centered, but very self-serving,

03:09:44.560 --> 03:09:47.560
if she can stick her way into it any way she can, she does.

03:09:47.560 --> 03:09:50.560
And so she FaceTimed me with them both together in the car,

03:09:50.560 --> 03:09:52.560
on their way to pick up food for a collab,

03:09:52.560 --> 03:09:54.560
when he was supposed to come over to collab with me,

03:09:54.560 --> 03:09:56.560
and I hate when people do this shit, I didn't want a three-way,

03:09:56.560 --> 03:10:00.560
I wanted one with Zach just like I had one with him on his channel, it's just not fair.

03:10:00.560 --> 03:10:04.560
Well, two times ago when I was in LA, I remember she messaged me saying,

03:10:04.560 --> 03:10:08.560
hey, I had this great idea, because another mukbanger named Kimmy was in town,

03:10:08.560 --> 03:10:11.560
and she's like, how about let's do a four-way collab with me, you, Kimmy, and Honey,

03:10:11.560 --> 03:10:13.560
and we'll put it on my channel.

03:10:13.560 --> 03:10:17.560
And Honey doesn't like Stephanie Sue either, but she's all she cares about herself.

03:10:17.560 --> 03:10:20.560
And Honey has never talked to her, she's never gotten to know her,

03:10:20.560 --> 03:10:22.560
she literally just said, hey, can you be on my channel?

03:10:22.560 --> 03:10:26.560
And it was all four of us that would get hella views, and she wanted her for her channel.

03:10:26.560 --> 03:10:30.560
She'd never talked to us before, never asked how we were doing, never wanted to meet,

03:10:30.560 --> 03:10:33.560
she just said come over and film, she just wanted to stick us on her channel,

03:10:33.560 --> 03:10:36.560
she doesn't even like us, she just wanted to use us, we felt very used.

03:10:36.560 --> 03:10:39.560
So I turned it down, so now this is happening all over again.

03:10:39.560 --> 03:10:44.560
Stephanie Sue, out of nowhere, after telling me, no, I can't collab with you because you're too much drama,

03:10:44.560 --> 03:10:49.560
pitched me an idea to collab with me, Honey Eats, Kimmy, and herself to put on her channel.

03:10:49.560 --> 03:10:53.560
Honey Eats doesn't like her. Kimmy doesn't like her.

03:10:53.560 --> 03:10:56.560
I didn't really like her, I didn't even know her.

03:10:56.560 --> 03:11:01.560
I felt that she was very self-serving, doesn't take the time to get to know Kimmy or me or Honey,

03:11:01.560 --> 03:11:08.560
ignores us, stands us up, but only asks for us, only reaches out to us if she wants something out of us.

03:11:08.560 --> 03:11:11.560
There's a lot of people who already have this opinion about Stephanie Sue.

03:11:11.560 --> 03:11:14.560
How she is on camera is not the real Stephanie Sue.

03:11:14.560 --> 03:11:19.560
She's very sneaky. How she is off camera, when we did those three-way collabs,

03:11:19.560 --> 03:11:24.560
she complained, she bitched, she moaned, she rolled her eyes.

03:11:24.560 --> 03:11:27.560
She even kinda alluded to this, saying like, keep pushing forward.

03:11:27.560 --> 03:11:32.560
It's like you invited yourself there. You could have said, actually, I changed my mind.

03:11:32.560 --> 03:11:36.560
It was just ridiculous, and she did it for her own benefit.

03:11:36.560 --> 03:11:41.560
So she could be on my channel, I get double her views, that she could be on Zach's channel in our collab,

03:11:41.560 --> 03:11:46.560
because she knows when me and Zach last collaborated, it got a million something views.

03:11:46.560 --> 03:11:49.560
She wanted to be part of that so that people could go to her page too.

03:11:49.560 --> 03:11:52.560
Not only does he manage to drag his friends in against their will,

03:11:52.560 --> 03:11:56.560
he reveals his own intentions to be rather crooked in befriending Stephanie Sue,

03:11:56.560 --> 03:12:00.560
and brings into question his intent in his friendships with other individuals.

03:12:00.560 --> 03:12:05.560
A lot of the DMs show Nick forcing a lot of assumptions, and being all-round instigator-y.

03:12:05.560 --> 03:12:08.560
In an attempt to attack Stephanie, he attacks himself.

03:12:08.560 --> 03:12:13.560
He cuts off the nose to spite the face, and the face wasn't even that pretty in the first place.

03:12:18.560 --> 03:12:23.560
I feel so bad for Honey, because people think she was just picking on Stephanie out of the blue.

03:12:23.560 --> 03:12:29.560
Stephanie has given her the middle finger for a very long time, she's taken some sponsorships from her,

03:12:29.560 --> 03:12:34.560
she's never ever gotten to know her, she only contacts her when she wants something out of her,

03:12:34.560 --> 03:12:39.560
and that's for Honey to talk about, if she wants to go into depth, there's a lot that goes on.

03:12:39.560 --> 03:12:45.560
I just don't, please don't think that Honey, I convinced Honey Stephanie was a d-

03:12:45.560 --> 03:12:47.560
Nick's video is a dumpster fire of responses.

03:12:47.560 --> 03:12:52.560
There is a fair bit that I am gonna try and save for later, because he goes at Stephanie from various angles,

03:12:52.560 --> 03:12:55.560
but it was exhausting, and not in a challenging way.

03:12:55.560 --> 03:13:00.560
Zach told me that Stephanie told him that she was willing to clap with me now,

03:13:00.560 --> 03:13:06.560
not the first time, not the second time, not the third time, maybe for a drama five-part docuseries on my channel,

03:13:06.560 --> 03:13:11.560
but now she's willing to do it because the views kept going down, down, down, down, down.

03:13:11.560 --> 03:13:16.560
You can look at her social blade, and her views have been going down for like almost half a year,

03:13:17.560 --> 03:13:24.560
just steadily declining. Now it's worth it, and now she's willing to do it because it's Nikocado Avocado,

03:13:24.560 --> 03:13:29.560
and she's gonna get clicks, because I am dramatic, because I am forthright, and I say too much,

03:13:29.560 --> 03:13:34.560
and I like to spill the beans, she knows that it would have gotten attention,

03:13:34.560 --> 03:13:37.560
and Zach told me that that's the reason she only decided to do it.

03:13:37.560 --> 03:13:42.560
There is barely a single point in the video where he shows a clip from Stephanie Sue's upload,

03:13:42.560 --> 03:13:44.560
and this leads to the most obtuse paraphrasing.

03:13:44.560 --> 03:13:53.560
Her first video back was In-N-Out Burger. I find it peculiar, I find it odd, very strange, very unusual behavior,

03:13:53.560 --> 03:13:58.560
coming from someone who sat on camera and said that what I did to her was, quote-unquote,

03:13:58.560 --> 03:14:04.560
the worst experience she's ever had. Remember, she said she went to the bathroom and had the worst breakdown of her life,

03:14:04.560 --> 03:14:06.560
and she couldn't even explain to her fiancé.

03:14:06.560 --> 03:14:13.560
To be honest, what it felt like, and the only way that I've ever felt like this to any degree in my life,

03:14:13.560 --> 03:14:21.560
prior to Nik, was a couple years ago, and I vowed I would never find myself in a position like that ever again,

03:14:21.560 --> 03:14:28.560
where I felt like, no, really didn't have a lot of power, and I felt like it didn't matter if I was uncomfortable.

03:14:28.560 --> 03:14:36.560
That night, I was really pushed into a really, really, really dark place that I never thought I would be in again.

03:14:36.560 --> 03:14:41.560
I had a breakdown, and it was unlike any other breakdown I had.

03:14:41.560 --> 03:14:54.560
It was one where I felt shame, guilt, because I did say, I did say I would talk about it, didn't I? I don't know, he said I did.

03:14:55.560 --> 03:15:00.560
Now, I don't know Stephanie Sue, I don't know her intent, but with Nik's own video and the additional DMs,

03:15:00.560 --> 03:15:05.560
it just looks like he's salty at the fact that he was beaten to the punch by a more tightly constructed exposé.

03:15:05.560 --> 03:15:10.560
For her to go on camera and say that nothing really happened, and she didn't want to talk about it,

03:15:10.560 --> 03:15:14.560
and it was a little annoying, but no big deal, that is completely, completely off base.

03:15:14.560 --> 03:15:21.560
Completely off base. She told me in my apartment, she told me in the car, she told me at her house,

03:15:21.560 --> 03:15:24.560
that we were going to discuss Veronica on my channel.

03:15:24.560 --> 03:15:29.560
She didn't feel comfortable doing the documentary on her own, because me and Zach both turned her down.

03:15:29.560 --> 03:15:33.560
So she was okay doing it with me, because let's face it, she said nothing.

03:15:33.560 --> 03:15:37.560
Was it my business? Not really at first, but I felt bad for Shuk-Ben.

03:15:37.560 --> 03:15:40.560
It became my business when Veronica went after me over and over and over,

03:15:40.560 --> 03:15:44.560
and that's why when I grabbed the camera at the airport, which we'll get into, and I said,

03:15:44.560 --> 03:15:52.560
Look, guys, I feel like this was a setup. This is why I feel this way, because she egged it on so rich off camera,

03:15:52.560 --> 03:15:58.560
and when the camera went on and saying, Hey, Nick, drop the subject, or, Hey, move your hands, edit it out,

03:15:58.560 --> 03:16:03.560
she sat there and was like, Oh, I'm so uncomfortable, so that people can look.

03:16:03.560 --> 03:16:08.560
Oh, Nick, dragging poor, innocent, little, fluffy Stephanie down a road she would never go on.

03:16:08.560 --> 03:16:12.560
He states that she was setting him up, but with the evidence, it appears to be completely the opposite.

03:16:12.560 --> 03:16:18.560
The DMs between them in the group chat show him making assertions which appear to be done with the intent to corner Stephanie,

03:16:18.560 --> 03:16:20.560
and pressure into saying something that might incriminate her.

03:16:20.560 --> 03:16:26.560
Fortunately, she was extremely cautious on this front, and traversed a lot of the inflammatory language with a diplomatic finesse.

03:16:26.560 --> 03:16:31.560
It seems pretty clear that Nick was planning his own video, and probably wanted to put Stephanie in a position

03:16:31.560 --> 03:16:35.560
where he'd be able to frame her as rude, hypocritical, whatever he could pin her as.

03:16:35.560 --> 03:16:38.560
He had all these receipts, probably with the plan to release them in the video,

03:16:38.560 --> 03:16:42.560
but with Stephanie's video, his release of many of these ended up backfiring unbelievably.

03:16:42.560 --> 03:16:45.560
A great example were his rants to Carly Steele.

03:16:51.560 --> 03:16:54.560
In Stephanie's additional response video, yep, there's another.

03:16:54.560 --> 03:16:59.560
With Zack's permission, she shares his DMs with Nick, which have Nick acknowledging that it wasn't just Stephanie

03:16:59.560 --> 03:17:03.560
inserting herself into the situation, directly contradicting Nick's rhetoric,

03:17:03.560 --> 03:17:06.560
and just shows how trash this trash talk was.

03:17:06.560 --> 03:17:11.560
Zack said, I just don't want you to say something was her idea when it was mine lol.

03:17:11.560 --> 03:17:16.560
Which is exactly what Nick did in his response video, he said that I pushed myself into the ASMR collabs.

03:17:16.560 --> 03:17:20.560
And Zack is saying, well, maybe you shouldn't say that, because that was actually my idea,

03:17:20.560 --> 03:17:22.560
and Nick did a thumbs down on it.

03:17:24.560 --> 03:17:28.560
And then he said, I know, it's been a different time, I'm about to film TTYL.

03:17:28.560 --> 03:17:29.560
So that's the truth.

03:17:29.560 --> 03:17:31.560
She's very like, um, self-serving.

03:17:31.560 --> 03:17:33.560
She seems very manipulative.

03:17:33.560 --> 03:17:35.560
She's f***ing rude, like I don't know how these people were raised.

03:17:35.560 --> 03:17:36.560
So that's the truth.

03:17:36.560 --> 03:17:41.560
You're using private conversations that you had with your friends, talking badly about me,

03:17:41.560 --> 03:17:47.560
it's a pattern of you posting people's private conversations in order to further your own narrative.

03:17:47.560 --> 03:17:52.560
It feels like Nick was trying to set up the drama by appealing to the spontaneity of his rants,

03:17:52.560 --> 03:17:55.560
when in fact, they were very calculated ways of setting a scene.

03:17:55.560 --> 03:17:59.560
So with all this in mind, did Nick manage to make any indisputable points in his video?

03:17:59.560 --> 03:18:03.560
Well, I can think of one actually, regarding the rice cake ASMR clip.

03:18:04.560 --> 03:18:09.560
And so we filmed the third video at the end of the ASMR because it was a whispering one.

03:18:09.560 --> 03:18:15.560
Nick turned to me and he said, is there anything else you'd like to say?

03:18:15.560 --> 03:18:20.560
And I just remember feeling so gutted, like my heart had dropped to the ground

03:18:20.560 --> 03:18:24.560
because I thought it was going to be another interrogation.

03:18:24.560 --> 03:18:26.560
What would you like to say?

03:18:30.560 --> 03:18:31.560
Thank you for watching us.

03:18:31.560 --> 03:18:37.560
And so I said, thanks for watching us eat this food.

03:18:37.560 --> 03:18:39.560
Stephanie, is there anything else you'd like to say?

03:18:39.560 --> 03:18:41.560
Obviously I'm not saying it like that because we're whispering.

03:18:41.560 --> 03:18:45.560
So I'm like, thank you, is there anything else you'd like to add?

03:18:45.560 --> 03:18:49.560
And Stephanie's gesturing and putting her hand up as if she wants to say something.

03:18:49.560 --> 03:18:52.560
And I'm like, okay, what would you like to add?

03:18:52.560 --> 03:18:59.560
She uses that, she chops out the context and she uses it to say I was pressuring her

03:18:59.560 --> 03:19:03.560
or making her feel uncomfortable, like I want to bring up Veronica again.

03:19:05.560 --> 03:19:09.560
In an ASMR, what were we just going to whisper about her at the end of the video?

03:19:13.560 --> 03:19:14.560
Thank you.

03:19:18.560 --> 03:19:19.560
What do we do now?

03:19:24.560 --> 03:19:25.560
Goodbye.

03:19:25.560 --> 03:19:26.560
She's playing the flute.

03:19:29.560 --> 03:19:30.560
Okay, ready?

03:19:31.560 --> 03:19:33.560
What would you like to say?

03:19:34.560 --> 03:19:36.560
Thank you for watching us eat this.

03:19:37.560 --> 03:19:41.560
With the full clip, it clearly shows Stephanie gesturing with her hands

03:19:41.560 --> 03:19:44.560
in a way that would imply she may want to add something,

03:19:44.560 --> 03:19:48.560
which would probably provoke Nick's comment on where there was anything she'd want to add.

03:19:48.560 --> 03:19:51.560
After having the displeasure of watching the clip a few too many times,

03:19:51.560 --> 03:19:55.560
I believe she wanted to finish swallowing her food before they concluded the video.

03:19:55.560 --> 03:19:58.560
I understand that in the moment she may have misinterpreted that comment,

03:19:58.560 --> 03:20:02.560
and revisiting the clip to add into her video, it's surprising to me that she wouldn't have noticed.

03:20:02.560 --> 03:20:07.560
She didn't respond to this in her second video either, and this led some to question her intentions.

03:20:07.560 --> 03:20:10.560
Just ridiculous. She knows exactly what she was doing.

03:20:10.560 --> 03:20:14.560
Do you think she didn't know how this would come across on screen?

03:20:14.560 --> 03:20:20.560
She was trying to emotionally sway her viewers into saying I had predatory tendencies,

03:20:20.560 --> 03:20:22.560
and of course it looks creepy because we're whispering.

03:20:22.560 --> 03:20:24.560
Is there anything else you'd like to add?

03:20:24.560 --> 03:20:29.560
You know, creepy, but we're whispering. Out of context, it looks even creepier.

03:20:29.560 --> 03:20:34.560
And she did this on person, on purpose, to sell a story.

03:20:34.560 --> 03:20:36.560
There are people out there who really don't like Stephanie Sue,

03:20:36.560 --> 03:20:39.560
and to them, her video was another classic case of manipulation,

03:20:39.560 --> 03:20:42.560
and some of Nick's narrative will inevitably stick with them,

03:20:42.560 --> 03:20:47.560
because Nick's narrative is built on the assumption that she's doing all this stuff with self-serving mal-intent,

03:20:47.560 --> 03:20:52.560
especially shown in her reaction, such as the merch, the extra content, the emotion, the story.

03:20:52.560 --> 03:20:55.560
However, a lot of the evidence also stood on its own,

03:20:55.560 --> 03:20:58.560
so you didn't have to necessarily like or dislike Stephanie Sue

03:20:58.560 --> 03:21:01.560
to see how unpleasant and coercive Nick was being.

03:21:01.560 --> 03:21:03.560
Like Trisha Paytas, it was too late,

03:21:03.560 --> 03:21:07.560
and he had messed up more than enough for people to take a look at these narratives against him,

03:21:07.560 --> 03:21:10.560
and unlike Trisha Paytas, Stephanie's further response video

03:21:10.560 --> 03:21:13.560
pointed out multiple specific flaws in his response,

03:21:13.560 --> 03:21:15.560
requested permission to release further evidence,

03:21:15.560 --> 03:21:20.560
requests that Nick never responded to, and even included new evidence on its own.

03:21:20.560 --> 03:21:23.560
Now, the second thing I'm going to be referencing is my home security footage.

03:21:23.560 --> 03:21:26.560
Now, I'm unable to release it to the public because California law,

03:21:26.560 --> 03:21:30.560
but Nick, give me your consent because you claim that I lied about so many things,

03:21:30.560 --> 03:21:32.560
whereas my home security footage says otherwise.

03:21:32.560 --> 03:21:35.560
So give me your consent if you truly think I'm a liar,

03:21:35.560 --> 03:21:37.560
if you truly think I'm a manipulator,

03:21:37.560 --> 03:21:41.560
if you truly think that your side is the truth, let me release the footage.

03:21:41.560 --> 03:21:43.560
But now he claims the minute he came over, I said,

03:21:43.560 --> 03:21:45.560
did you see my oven? Did you look at it?

03:21:45.560 --> 03:21:49.560
He spoke about my oven prior to coming over to my house.

03:21:49.560 --> 03:21:51.560
Like a five-layer oven? Who uses that?

03:21:51.560 --> 03:21:54.560
Now, I, without your consent, cannot release the security footage

03:21:54.560 --> 03:21:58.560
of you taking pictures when I go to the restroom, but you release this picture.

03:21:58.560 --> 03:22:02.560
And if you zoom in closely, you're alone in my kitchen taking this picture.

03:22:06.560 --> 03:22:08.560
So you took the picture when I was in the bathroom.

03:22:08.560 --> 03:22:12.560
I have never recorded anyone ever without their consent.

03:22:12.560 --> 03:22:15.560
I took a photo with her consent.

03:22:15.560 --> 03:22:17.560
There's another thing actually on Zach's channel.

03:22:17.560 --> 03:22:19.560
At the end of it, there's like one piece of chicken left.

03:22:19.560 --> 03:22:23.560
And the last scene, we had discussed it was Stephanie's idea

03:22:23.560 --> 03:22:26.560
that she would have the last leg and I would look at her like,

03:22:26.560 --> 03:22:30.560
ooh, what you doing? Because I'm, you know, the fat pig that loves to eat.

03:22:30.560 --> 03:22:33.560
And it was literally following what me and Trisha had done,

03:22:33.560 --> 03:22:37.560
where we sat there with our noodles and we looked at each other and we glared.

03:22:37.560 --> 03:22:39.560
Well, people are taking that clip now and saying,

03:22:39.560 --> 03:22:43.560
ah, here's proof of Nick looking at Stephanie all creepily.

03:22:44.560 --> 03:22:47.560
And that was her idea. I didn't even, I didn't even,

03:22:47.560 --> 03:22:52.560
I didn't even realize until when I watched the video that I was like,

03:22:52.560 --> 03:22:54.560
she wasn't looking back at me either.

03:22:54.560 --> 03:22:58.560
It was a YouTube video. I was, there was no thought into it.

03:22:58.560 --> 03:23:02.560
Looking at each other, she didn't look at me and I say to myself,

03:23:02.560 --> 03:23:05.560
why didn't she, why would she say to do this?

03:23:05.560 --> 03:23:07.560
Where we look at each other who's going to go for the last chicken leg.

03:23:07.560 --> 03:23:09.560
And when the cameras are rolling,

03:23:09.560 --> 03:23:12.560
she just looks at the screen as if she doesn't know what I'm doing over there.

03:23:13.560 --> 03:23:15.560
Like what the hell, man.

03:23:15.560 --> 03:23:19.560
This is one of those moments where I saw this video and you had said this

03:23:19.560 --> 03:23:22.560
blatant lie with so much conviction, no evidence,

03:23:22.560 --> 03:23:27.560
just such a strong voice that I was like, did I do that?

03:23:27.560 --> 03:23:31.560
And so I reached out to Zach and he has the full unedited version of that.

03:23:31.560 --> 03:23:32.560
And this is what happened.

03:23:32.560 --> 03:23:34.560
I got you some good comments.

03:23:35.560 --> 03:23:36.560
So she had the last thing, right?

03:23:36.560 --> 03:23:39.560
We're eating and I was just sitting here and I was going like this.

03:23:40.560 --> 03:23:44.560
So are you lying or is that footage lying?

03:23:44.560 --> 03:23:47.560
Now the next thing that he brings up in his video is about Veronica.

03:23:47.560 --> 03:23:49.560
The way that he approached this topic,

03:23:49.560 --> 03:23:53.560
I thought was so incredibly manipulative because he made it seem like I have

03:23:53.560 --> 03:23:54.560
this dirty little secret.

03:23:54.560 --> 03:23:57.560
So I'm going to read to you guys some of the text messages that he showed

03:23:57.560 --> 03:24:00.560
because he failed to read a lot of the important parts of it.

03:24:00.560 --> 03:24:03.560
I wanted to make this docu-series and I wanted to highlight not only

03:24:03.560 --> 03:24:04.560
everything that happened,

03:24:04.560 --> 03:24:07.560
but I also wanted to highlight some of the important parts of it.

03:24:07.560 --> 03:24:10.560
I wanted to highlight not only everything that happened with Shookbung and

03:24:10.560 --> 03:24:12.560
including what happened between Veronica and I,

03:24:12.560 --> 03:24:14.560
but also all of the personal conflicts that were involved.

03:24:14.560 --> 03:24:17.560
I wanted it to be less drama focused,

03:24:17.560 --> 03:24:20.560
but more about the personal struggles behind all of the decisions that were

03:24:20.560 --> 03:24:22.560
made. And to give you guys some perspective,

03:24:22.560 --> 03:24:25.560
this is what I said to Veronica, which Nick has never seen.

03:24:25.560 --> 03:24:26.560
You know,

03:24:26.560 --> 03:24:28.560
I would also like to showcase the side of you that shows that you're not just

03:24:28.560 --> 03:24:29.560
here for the drama,

03:24:29.560 --> 03:24:32.560
but you're here for the underdogs and the word she said to you hurt you and

03:24:32.560 --> 03:24:33.560
not just angered you.

03:24:33.560 --> 03:24:36.560
I would also like people to see a little glimpse of vulnerability from

03:24:36.560 --> 03:24:38.560
Nikocado, obviously to your comfort,

03:24:38.560 --> 03:24:41.560
just like how my perspective changed when I actually got to meet you in

03:24:41.560 --> 03:24:42.560
person.

03:24:42.560 --> 03:24:47.560
I don't know how he took this and twisted it so out of context to make it

03:24:47.560 --> 03:24:52.560
seem like I am obsessed with Veronica and I need to get an apology from her

03:24:52.560 --> 03:24:55.560
and she did me so dirty and I just will not let it go.

03:24:55.560 --> 03:24:58.560
That is what I told the group chat and that is what I told Veronica.

03:24:58.560 --> 03:25:01.560
And Nick claims that I didn't do it because Nick didn't want to be a part of

03:25:01.560 --> 03:25:04.560
it. In reality, Veronica shut me down.

03:25:04.560 --> 03:25:05.560
She's moved on. She's thriving.

03:25:05.560 --> 03:25:08.560
If you don't know the difference between exposing someone,

03:25:08.560 --> 03:25:14.560
a tea video spilling the tea versus having a productive adult conversation,

03:25:14.560 --> 03:25:15.560
then I don't know.

03:25:15.560 --> 03:25:16.560
That seems like it's on you.

03:25:16.560 --> 03:25:23.560
It was Stephanie Sue going on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on

03:25:23.560 --> 03:25:25.560
about all of this stuff between her and Veronica.

03:25:25.560 --> 03:25:26.560
I didn't even ask her.

03:25:26.560 --> 03:25:27.560
Nick,

03:25:27.560 --> 03:25:32.560
you went on and on and on and on and on about Veronica in the videos that you

03:25:32.560 --> 03:25:33.560
made about her.

03:25:33.560 --> 03:25:35.560
You went on and on about her in my DMs.

03:25:35.560 --> 03:25:39.560
You went on and on and on about her at dinner when we first met and you went

03:25:39.560 --> 03:25:45.560
on and on and on about her in that footage of that mukbang that you refused

03:25:45.560 --> 03:25:46.560
to release.

03:25:46.560 --> 03:25:48.560
So please, you have my full consent.

03:25:48.560 --> 03:25:50.560
Just two weeks ago was in Los Angeles.

03:25:50.560 --> 03:25:52.560
It was still looming over her head then too.

03:25:52.560 --> 03:25:53.560
And I'm going to get into that.

03:25:53.560 --> 03:25:55.560
She's giving Veronica a lot of credit here.

03:25:55.560 --> 03:25:59.560
An opportunity for all of us to right our wrongs and dig deep into meaningful

03:25:59.560 --> 03:26:00.560
conversation, blah, blah, blah.

03:26:00.560 --> 03:26:01.560
Okay.

03:26:01.560 --> 03:26:05.560
So do I hate Veronica and I have this thing looming over my head or am I

03:26:05.560 --> 03:26:06.560
trying to have deep,

03:26:06.560 --> 03:26:10.560
meaningful conversations and am I giving Veronica too much credit?

03:26:10.560 --> 03:26:11.560
Which one is it?

03:26:11.560 --> 03:26:13.560
Pitched me an idea to collab with me,

03:26:13.560 --> 03:26:16.560
HoneyEats, Kimmy and herself to put on her channel.

03:26:16.560 --> 03:26:19.560
Now, just so he doesn't try to take this out of context again,

03:26:19.560 --> 03:26:20.560
like I had mentioned,

03:26:20.560 --> 03:26:23.560
just me doing a video with Nick would make it seem like I'm taking a side in

03:26:23.560 --> 03:26:24.560
the drama.

03:26:24.560 --> 03:26:27.560
Whereas me doing a video with Veronica and Nick and talking about everything

03:26:27.560 --> 03:26:29.560
that's happened with everyone that is involved.

03:26:29.560 --> 03:26:31.560
That's just having an adult conversation.

03:26:31.560 --> 03:26:34.560
I actually felt bad for turning down the collab with just you.

03:26:34.560 --> 03:26:35.560
And at the same time,

03:26:35.560 --> 03:26:37.560
Kimmy had reached out and said that she was going to be in LA.

03:26:37.560 --> 03:26:39.560
And so I thought this would be a cool idea.

03:26:39.560 --> 03:26:41.560
Now, usually when YouTubers collab,

03:26:41.560 --> 03:26:44.560
they do one video for every single person's channel.

03:26:44.560 --> 03:26:48.560
So please don't make it look like I'm just trying to get AdSense money when

03:26:48.560 --> 03:26:49.560
you're the one that reached out first.

03:26:49.560 --> 03:26:51.560
I felt that she was very self-serving.

03:26:51.560 --> 03:26:53.560
You're the one that reached out to me.

03:26:53.560 --> 03:26:55.560
You're the one that asked to collab.

03:26:55.560 --> 03:26:57.560
When apparently you didn't even like me.

03:26:57.560 --> 03:26:59.560
HoneyEats doesn't like her.

03:26:59.560 --> 03:27:00.560
Kimmy doesn't like her.

03:27:00.560 --> 03:27:01.560
Again,

03:27:01.560 --> 03:27:04.560
using other people's words publicly to hurt and humiliate other people.

03:27:04.560 --> 03:27:06.560
But I didn't know that at the time,

03:27:06.560 --> 03:27:08.560
but you knew that you didn't like me at the time,

03:27:08.560 --> 03:27:12.560
but you still wanted to collab so that our collaboration videos would get

03:27:12.560 --> 03:27:14.560
views. Who's really self-serving?

03:27:14.560 --> 03:27:17.560
My first impression of Stephanie was very self-serving.

03:27:17.560 --> 03:27:18.560
I didn't give her a gift.

03:27:18.560 --> 03:27:20.560
We were just going to hang out and get to know each other.

03:27:20.560 --> 03:27:21.560
That was my first impression.

03:27:21.560 --> 03:27:24.560
Like warm and bubbly, gave me a hug, said hello.

03:27:24.560 --> 03:27:25.560
Very self-serving.

03:27:25.560 --> 03:27:27.560
Little welcome to Los Angeles gift for me.

03:27:27.560 --> 03:27:29.560
And I'm like, wow.

03:27:29.560 --> 03:27:31.560
She seems like she'll be a nice person.

03:27:33.560 --> 03:27:34.560
Very.

03:27:34.560 --> 03:27:35.560
So that's the truth.

03:27:35.560 --> 03:27:36.560
So which one's the truth?

03:27:36.560 --> 03:27:38.560
I didn't really like her.

03:27:38.560 --> 03:27:43.560
I love Stephanie Sue because I don't like it is in Stephanie's video saying

03:27:43.560 --> 03:27:44.560
she doesn't know how to say no to me.

03:27:44.560 --> 03:27:47.560
She's so afraid for, she said no to me lots of different times.

03:27:47.560 --> 03:27:49.560
She said no to me over dinner.

03:27:49.560 --> 03:27:51.560
Look at what happened when I did say no to you.

03:27:51.560 --> 03:27:54.560
And then during this group chat, when you said awesome,

03:27:54.560 --> 03:27:56.560
when would you like to reschedule?

03:27:56.560 --> 03:28:01.560
Prior to doing that, you had already texted Zach privately saying,

03:28:01.560 --> 03:28:04.560
notice how her text tests didn't mention rescheduling LMAO.

03:28:04.560 --> 03:28:06.560
I'm exposing her tonight.

03:28:06.560 --> 03:28:09.560
And then you proceeded to post all of these on social media.

03:28:09.560 --> 03:28:13.560
I did it because I was saying, look, I have people on my side.

03:28:13.560 --> 03:28:16.560
So look at what happens when I say no to you.

03:28:16.560 --> 03:28:18.560
Move me off the next day for our collabs.

03:28:19.560 --> 03:28:22.560
You know, this is where a lot of my frustration was coming from.

03:28:22.560 --> 03:28:25.560
I texted you in the group chat at 5.05 and I said,

03:28:25.560 --> 03:28:28.560
I know that you're in LA for only a couple more days and have a lot scheduled.

03:28:28.560 --> 03:28:30.560
Again, I'm so sorry for today.

03:28:30.560 --> 03:28:32.560
And I hope you're able to enjoy the rest of your day.

03:28:32.560 --> 03:28:33.560
That was at 5.05 PM.

03:28:33.560 --> 03:28:39.560
At 5.18 PM, which is you texted Carly Steele saying,

03:28:39.560 --> 03:28:42.560
bitch, I'm being ghosted by Stephanie Sue right now.

03:28:42.560 --> 03:28:45.560
I am so sorry that I ghosted you for 13 minutes.

03:28:45.560 --> 03:28:48.560
And now she's willing to do it because it's Nikocado Avocado

03:28:48.560 --> 03:28:49.560
and she's going to get clicks.

03:28:49.560 --> 03:28:52.560
Earlier you said that I wanted to do a collab with four people,

03:28:52.560 --> 03:28:55.560
with you, me, Kimi and Hyunee and post it on my channel

03:28:55.560 --> 03:28:57.560
because I want views and money.

03:28:57.560 --> 03:29:02.560
But then now you're saying that I pushed my way into a collab on Zach's channel

03:29:02.560 --> 03:29:06.560
because that would get more views from me, which means more exposure.

03:29:06.560 --> 03:29:09.560
But that's contradicting with your text messages with Zach.

03:29:09.560 --> 03:29:13.560
But on top of that, I think I would have done just fine on Zach's channel without you.

03:29:13.560 --> 03:29:17.560
She put a sale on every single one of her items.

03:29:17.560 --> 03:29:20.560
I didn't just put a sale on it.

03:29:20.560 --> 03:29:26.560
I got a text message Saturday, December 21st, and this was from my manager at Fanjoy.

03:29:26.560 --> 03:29:28.560
She's never had a sale there before.

03:29:28.560 --> 03:29:31.560
She rarely uses their logos, Pizza Hut, Little Caesars,

03:29:31.560 --> 03:29:34.560
because it's subliminal marketing and that comes at a high price.

03:29:34.560 --> 03:29:38.560
And she says unless a company is paying her for that service,

03:29:38.560 --> 03:29:40.560
she's not going to hand it to them.

03:29:40.560 --> 03:29:41.560
This is a lie too.

03:29:43.560 --> 03:29:46.560
Why do you keep speaking for me? I never said that.

03:29:52.560 --> 03:29:54.560
You say it was the first time for me, so it's like,

03:29:54.560 --> 03:29:56.560
oh, she planned it because it's the first time she did this.

03:29:56.560 --> 03:30:01.560
It was also a first that I've never gone more than two days without posting on both of my channels.

03:30:01.560 --> 03:30:04.560
I've never made a video like that about another influencer.

03:30:04.560 --> 03:30:05.560
That was a first.

03:30:05.560 --> 03:30:08.560
I've never felt scared of another influencer.

03:30:08.560 --> 03:30:09.560
That was a first.

03:30:09.560 --> 03:30:12.560
So, yeah, there was a lot of firsts.

03:30:12.560 --> 03:30:18.560
I don't know why you would think that all of a sudden I wanted to have this master plan to expose Nick for something.

03:30:18.560 --> 03:30:20.560
Oh, and I know I've mentioned this before,

03:30:20.560 --> 03:30:26.560
but appealing to Zach's authority is still one of the most astounding misfires in YouTube drama history.

03:30:26.560 --> 03:30:28.560
She told me in my apartment, she told me in the car,

03:30:28.560 --> 03:30:33.560
she told me at her house that we were going to discuss Veronica on my channel

03:30:33.560 --> 03:30:36.560
because she egged it on so rich off camera.

03:30:36.560 --> 03:30:39.560
These happened the night when I got home from the collab.

03:30:39.560 --> 03:30:42.560
We're talking about if you were going to post the footage

03:30:42.560 --> 03:30:46.560
because at this point we were even scared to ask you to not post it.

03:30:46.560 --> 03:30:49.560
And then Zach said, that's what makes me think he doesn't care.

03:30:49.560 --> 03:30:55.560
It's so crazy too because I asked him privately if he was going to go in about Veronica and he said no.

03:30:55.560 --> 03:30:58.560
I asked him so many times what you guys would even talk about

03:30:58.560 --> 03:31:04.560
because he always said he'd stay away from Veronica because he knew it would make you uncomfortable.

03:31:04.560 --> 03:31:08.560
That's why I was so surprised when he said he wanted to clear the air and talk about it.

03:31:08.560 --> 03:31:11.560
He made it look like you really wanted to talk about her so bad.

03:31:11.560 --> 03:31:13.560
You planned the discussion ahead of time.

03:31:13.560 --> 03:31:16.560
You're saying that I wanted to talk so much about Veronica,

03:31:16.560 --> 03:31:20.560
but then you told Zach that you weren't going to talk about Veronica and I would be uncomfortable.

03:31:20.560 --> 03:31:22.560
And you knew that. Which one's the truth?

03:31:22.560 --> 03:31:28.560
One of the most shattering new pieces of evidence was the alleged person who Nick spoke about in his deleted New York video,

03:31:28.560 --> 03:31:32.560
offering his story to another video if necessary, with receipts.

03:31:32.560 --> 03:31:38.560
This was particularly interesting as I'd initially dismissed this video as being a played up act from Nick's persona,

03:31:38.560 --> 03:31:42.560
something that many mukbang creators, Stephanie included, had been known for doing,

03:31:42.560 --> 03:31:46.560
often told through the lens of a younger Stephanie known as Stippetty.

03:31:46.560 --> 03:31:48.560
So I go into his closet,

03:31:52.560 --> 03:31:54.560
I have a pair of scissors from his desk,

03:31:54.560 --> 03:31:57.560
and I cut a hole on the butt of every one of his drawers that he had.

03:31:57.560 --> 03:32:01.560
It wasn't even like an organised cut, like I stacked them together, I like folded them, cut them,

03:32:01.560 --> 03:32:06.560
because this guy was going to get emotional, he was obsessed with his drawers, like I said.

03:32:06.560 --> 03:32:09.560
However, it appeared that there was a deeper story behind the video,

03:32:09.560 --> 03:32:12.560
and possibly even more that could be said about Nick's character.

03:32:12.560 --> 03:32:18.560
So I posted the video, and within a couple hours I got an email and a DM from someone,

03:32:18.560 --> 03:32:23.560
and they showed me proof that they had met Nick in New York,

03:32:23.560 --> 03:32:28.560
and they showed me pictures of their Snapchat between him and Nick, talking about that date.

03:32:28.560 --> 03:32:30.560
Nikocado did it to me.

03:32:30.560 --> 03:32:33.560
I am that boy that little me too video is about.

03:32:33.560 --> 03:32:37.560
I would love to talk to you about it, we have a lot in common, I have all the screenshots as well.

03:32:37.560 --> 03:32:41.560
And then he showed me screenshots of Snapchat and a picture that he took with Nick.

03:32:41.560 --> 03:32:47.560
I was so scared, because he kept making all these posts about how he was going to tell this big story about me,

03:32:47.560 --> 03:32:51.560
and I kept begging him to not post anything about me because unlike him,

03:32:51.560 --> 03:32:54.560
I'm just a regular person with no level of fame.

03:32:54.560 --> 03:33:00.560
In the original video, he showed me, but with an emoji over my face, and proceeded to call me a loser.

03:33:00.560 --> 03:33:06.560
It was just so crazy, because like he did to you, he made me feel so comfortable in person when we first met.

03:33:06.560 --> 03:33:12.560
We talked all night, and then when I left, he gave me a hug and said it was nice meeting you,

03:33:12.560 --> 03:33:16.560
and I said it was nice meeting him too.

03:33:16.560 --> 03:33:18.560
So I thought we left on good terms.

03:33:18.560 --> 03:33:23.560
Then on Snapchat, he told me he was pissed that I didn't hook up with him.

03:33:23.560 --> 03:33:27.560
And I was so so confused, because I thought we left happy.

03:33:27.560 --> 03:33:33.560
And then he went and filmed that rant video about me, and he got so much hate for it, he took it down.

03:33:33.560 --> 03:33:39.560
And then he made another one about me, but once again got hate, and took it down.

03:33:39.560 --> 03:33:46.560
But it's scary, because we filmed a regular video, so he has that footage of me, in addition to some naked pictures.

03:33:46.560 --> 03:33:51.560
I was so happy when it was all over, because he could have destroyed me, and still could.

03:33:51.560 --> 03:33:56.560
I personally think that that was highly relevant to Nick's pattern of behavior,

03:33:56.560 --> 03:34:00.560
and if I hadn't made that video, I wouldn't have spoken to this guy from New York.

03:34:00.560 --> 03:34:07.560
I wouldn't have known that he felt exactly the way I felt, scared, confused, threatened, bullied.

03:34:07.560 --> 03:34:11.560
So yes, I think it's important to point out people's patterns of behavior,

03:34:11.560 --> 03:34:16.560
especially if it's a creator who's using their platform to threaten, and to bully others.

03:34:16.560 --> 03:34:20.560
If something comes up where he attacks you or something, and you want me to tell my story,

03:34:20.560 --> 03:34:23.560
I'd consider doing it, because he really needs to be stopped.

03:34:23.560 --> 03:34:28.560
With all this on the brink, Nick didn't respond, and decided to move on from Stephanie's suit.

03:34:28.560 --> 03:34:33.560
This was maybe because he wasn't sure what to say, or maybe he thought he couldn't turn perspective around.

03:34:33.560 --> 03:34:37.560
But in this instance, it seems that Stephanie had won the battle of character attacks.

03:34:37.560 --> 03:34:40.560
To be honest, I can understand why someone may have a problem with Stephanie's commentary.

03:34:40.560 --> 03:34:44.560
If you don't like her, then you will receive the impression that she's manipulating her situation

03:34:44.560 --> 03:34:49.560
to be much worse than it is to expose Nick, and there have been some interesting criticisms,

03:34:49.560 --> 03:34:53.560
particularly for her first video, but for me, because she spoke from her personal perspective,

03:34:53.560 --> 03:34:56.560
and separated a lot of the facts from her own personal interpretation,

03:34:56.560 --> 03:35:00.560
it made it difficult for me to draw any clear character inferences.

03:35:00.560 --> 03:35:03.560
It's a carefully worded video with strong themes for the most part.

03:35:03.560 --> 03:35:08.560
Although that approach could be read as orchestration, it would also be the right way to go about making a video like this,

03:35:08.560 --> 03:35:11.560
so it ultimately comes down to how you read her intent.

03:35:11.560 --> 03:35:15.560
In many ways, it was exactly like what Nick did in his Trisha Paytas video.

03:35:15.560 --> 03:35:17.560
So what was the difference here?

03:35:17.560 --> 03:35:22.560
Well, the difference was that with context, Trisha's actions didn't look half as bad as Nick had portrayed them,

03:35:22.560 --> 03:35:28.560
whereas with a few exceptions here, most of Nick's behaviour appeared to be exactly as presented and proven by Nick himself.

03:35:28.560 --> 03:35:32.560
The only weaker point of this video, in my opinion, is the photos Nick took,

03:35:32.560 --> 03:35:36.560
which Stephanie attacks quite harshly as a breach of personal security.

03:35:36.560 --> 03:35:39.560
When I did go to the restroom, you did take pictures behind my back,

03:35:39.560 --> 03:35:44.560
and I didn't approve of those pictures, and you kept trying to make it seem like I'm crazy,

03:35:44.560 --> 03:35:47.560
I'm a manipulator for being scared of you releasing these pictures,

03:35:47.560 --> 03:35:52.560
so then you went on to release the exact pictures that I would never want on the internet.

03:35:52.560 --> 03:35:57.560
You released a picture of my kitchen with my security feed straight dab in the middle,

03:35:57.560 --> 03:35:59.560
and you didn't have the courtesy to blur it out.

03:35:59.560 --> 03:36:01.560
I don't know what you were interested in that picture.

03:36:01.560 --> 03:36:05.560
Was it the kitchen cabinets? Because you could have gotten more of the cabinets from a different angle.

03:36:05.560 --> 03:36:09.560
Was it the curtain? Because you could have gotten more of the curtain from a different angle.

03:36:09.560 --> 03:36:12.560
Although I don't think Nick should have released pictures at all without permission,

03:36:12.560 --> 03:36:15.560
it's probably worth noting that you have broadcast the house prior,

03:36:15.560 --> 03:36:19.560
and such images are accessible, partly by your own doing.

03:36:19.560 --> 03:36:22.560
It would have helped make the point more precise, so you convey your issue.

03:36:22.560 --> 03:36:25.560
Certain claims that Stephanie had labelled Nick a sexual predator,

03:36:25.560 --> 03:36:28.560
or at least implied, which I expected to see in the video,

03:36:28.560 --> 03:36:30.560
I didn't really feel stacked up.

03:36:30.560 --> 03:36:34.560
She defines the parallels pretty clearly, and also clarifies this position in her second video.

03:36:34.560 --> 03:36:38.560
I never implied that Nick sexually harassed me.

03:36:38.560 --> 03:36:41.560
I never implied that Nick did anything illegal.

03:36:41.560 --> 03:36:46.560
I never implied that Nick committed crimes towards me, or towards anybody else.

03:36:46.560 --> 03:36:48.560
I feel like a lot of us run off patterns.

03:36:48.560 --> 03:36:52.560
I don't know if I'm the only one, but if someone makes a mistake, you forgive them.

03:36:52.560 --> 03:36:57.560
But if they continue to do the same, same thing over and over and over again,

03:36:57.560 --> 03:37:00.560
and they hurt people every single time,

03:37:00.560 --> 03:37:03.560
I think that's very dangerous, and I think that's very alarming.

03:37:03.560 --> 03:37:06.560
I do think the whole Dick Suck line was a bit unnecessary,

03:37:06.560 --> 03:37:09.560
although I acknowledge its use was more dramatically motivated.

03:37:09.560 --> 03:37:13.560
Other points, such as hypocrisy relating to a mockery of Nick's stamina,

03:37:13.560 --> 03:37:16.560
Other points, such as hypocrisy relating to a mockery of Nick's stamina,

03:37:16.560 --> 03:37:19.560
while criticising his use of the In-N-Out joke, are not unreasonable,

03:37:19.560 --> 03:37:22.560
but they're extracted from the context of the points as well.

03:37:22.560 --> 03:37:26.560
She took a part where I was stuttering all my words, and made fun of it.

03:37:26.560 --> 03:37:29.560
It wasn't that big of a deal, I'm not going to lose sleep over it.

03:37:29.560 --> 03:37:33.560
Honestly, if this problem wasn't happening, I wouldn't even think twice over it.

03:37:33.560 --> 03:37:36.560
I'm only bringing this up because it's very peculiar.

03:37:36.560 --> 03:37:38.560
She's trying to have this campaign against bullying,

03:37:38.560 --> 03:37:40.560
and she would never want to bully someone,

03:37:40.560 --> 03:37:48.560
and I'm trying to do this benevolent thing where I turn this terrible, terrible phrase into something happy and good.

03:37:48.560 --> 03:37:51.560
Not only did she not say, hey viewers don't bully either,

03:37:51.560 --> 03:37:56.560
she didn't say that, but she also essentially poked fun at me too.

03:37:56.560 --> 03:37:59.560
But she's thinking that I was such a bully, bully, bully,

03:37:59.560 --> 03:38:02.560
but I didn't put it on YouTube, it was on my Instagram,

03:38:02.560 --> 03:38:05.560
and no one knew what that was about, except for like three or four people.

03:38:05.560 --> 03:38:09.560
And then she put that on her video, which got viewed six million times.

03:38:10.560 --> 03:38:15.560
Of course people are going to see that as license to go to my channel and add fuel to the fire.

03:38:15.560 --> 03:38:21.560
The mocking of a person's speech errors is something that could be levelled towards most creators as a universally comprehendable joke.

03:38:21.560 --> 03:38:22.560
It's obvious.

03:38:22.560 --> 03:38:27.560
The In-N-Out joke was an inside joke which really had little use in being public,

03:38:27.560 --> 03:38:30.560
which is why the argument was made that its utilisation was more malicious.

03:38:30.560 --> 03:38:33.560
Equally, that's why she had no trouble making charity merch out of it,

03:38:33.560 --> 03:38:36.560
because when revealed, the joke loses its power.

03:38:36.560 --> 03:38:41.560
It doesn't mean that these points are invalid, but because there's rationale behind the other side,

03:38:41.560 --> 03:38:45.560
a tone of slam-dunk righteous anger will likely go down like a lead balloon.

03:39:01.560 --> 03:39:04.560
I understand the use of certain buzzwords may blur the line,

03:39:04.560 --> 03:39:09.560
and definitely cause some more zealous community members to use the video to make more harmful statements.

03:39:09.560 --> 03:39:11.560
It could be a bit irresponsible in that regard,

03:39:11.560 --> 03:39:14.560
but personally speaking, as someone with similar background to Stephanie,

03:39:14.560 --> 03:39:19.560
being placed in positions where you feel that saying no could have greater consequence can be really upsetting,

03:39:19.560 --> 03:39:22.560
and I don't think she conveyed that incorrectly.

03:39:22.560 --> 03:39:25.560
Whether the framing was too harsh on Nick's intentions is another question,

03:39:25.560 --> 03:39:27.560
based on Nick's own knowledge of Stephanie's background.

03:39:27.560 --> 03:39:30.560
Stephanie stated that she had informed Nick of her history,

03:39:30.560 --> 03:39:33.560
but it would be easy to forget, and it depends who you believe.

03:39:33.560 --> 03:39:37.560
There was also uncertainty about whether this could have been resolved elsewhere or not,

03:39:37.560 --> 03:39:38.560
and how it could have been handled.

03:39:38.560 --> 03:39:41.560
Valid questions, I'll say, which I'll save until the end.

03:39:41.560 --> 03:39:44.560
Regardless of the answer, one thing was certain.

03:39:44.560 --> 03:39:48.560
Nick was under fire like never before, and he had no clue how to deal with it.

03:39:48.560 --> 03:39:59.560
Over 6 million people have viewed this video.

03:39:59.560 --> 03:40:03.560
I just checked. 6 million people from around the world.

03:40:03.560 --> 03:40:08.560
I certainly don't have 6 million people out there who know who I am.

03:40:08.560 --> 03:40:12.560
There aren't 6 million people who know who Stephanie is.

03:40:12.560 --> 03:40:17.560
I mean, I don't even have 2 million subscribers, let alone 6.

03:40:17.560 --> 03:40:24.560
That leaves for millions of people to discover and learn who I am

03:40:24.560 --> 03:40:29.560
from direct avenue of this video, which is fine.

03:40:29.560 --> 03:40:36.560
You can make videos about me all you want, but the title is why you're scared of me.

03:40:36.560 --> 03:40:43.560
Millions of people are coming to this video to learn why this girl who's crying and holding herself,

03:40:43.560 --> 03:40:46.560
which, by the way, the thumbnail doesn't even appear in the video,

03:40:46.560 --> 03:40:50.560
why she's scared of me.

03:40:50.560 --> 03:40:54.560
And what do they see when they click it to learn why?

03:40:54.560 --> 03:40:59.560
They see a clip of me taken out of context of me saying to her,

03:40:59.560 --> 03:41:01.560
I hope you can trust me, or something along those lines,

03:41:01.560 --> 03:41:03.560
oh, we can trust each other now.

03:41:03.560 --> 03:41:10.560
There's another clip of me taken out of context making comments about the Me Too movement.

03:41:11.560 --> 03:41:15.560
I'm saying that because of how she put this on the internet,

03:41:15.560 --> 03:41:20.560
I'm now gonna have to live with people calling me a predator for God knows how long.

03:41:20.560 --> 03:41:24.560
And she knows that most people are not gonna watch that whole video either.

03:41:24.560 --> 03:41:27.560
45 minutes, 50 minutes, that's a very long time.

03:41:27.560 --> 03:41:31.560
One thing that Stephanie briefly touched on in the last clip but otherwise didn't mention

03:41:31.560 --> 03:41:34.560
was a lot of Nick's points about the calculated nature of her video,

03:41:34.560 --> 03:41:38.560
how certain things were added for theatrics, and he's not entirely wrong,

03:41:38.560 --> 03:41:43.560
but it's the gauntlet which has been laid down by numerous videos, Nick's own included.

03:41:43.560 --> 03:41:49.560
She knows what she was doing, that's not an accident, that's not an accident at all,

03:41:49.560 --> 03:41:53.560
which is why the tags have Nikocado Avocado High, I know you see this,

03:41:53.560 --> 03:41:57.560
which is why she liked my post about exposing her,

03:41:57.560 --> 03:42:04.560
which is why she deliberately told me to look at her, and it feels like I was set up, it's really crazy.

03:42:04.560 --> 03:42:09.560
Nick's own videos showed that audiences cared a hell of a lot about how information is conveyed,

03:42:09.560 --> 03:42:11.560
often more than the information itself.

03:42:11.560 --> 03:42:16.560
Nick was a toxic person for multiple reasons, and so when this observable toxicity

03:42:16.560 --> 03:42:21.560
was paired with his own formula and used against him much more effectively than he ever used it,

03:42:21.560 --> 03:42:26.560
it may have been ironic, but it was also not in the slightest bit surprising that this was the outcome.

03:42:26.560 --> 03:42:30.560
I can't pry it into Stephanie's mind, but it would not surprise me

03:42:30.560 --> 03:42:34.560
if Stephanie had made the video partly because she anticipated Nick making his own,

03:42:34.560 --> 03:42:38.560
which I think he definitely was. Stephanie had smartly handled Nick's instigator-y behaviour

03:42:38.560 --> 03:42:42.560
by providing him with as little cause for conflict as possible,

03:42:42.560 --> 03:42:45.560
which is why she stuck around and attempted to complete the collabs,

03:42:45.560 --> 03:42:47.560
because tonally that was the best thing to do.

03:42:47.560 --> 03:42:51.560
She tried to make it seem like it wasn't an issue, but Nick knows how to generate drama,

03:42:51.560 --> 03:42:53.560
even when there may not appear to be any.

03:42:53.560 --> 03:42:57.560
The Stephanie Sue good girl isn't as good as you think is great clickbait,

03:42:57.560 --> 03:43:00.560
so she went ahead with her pre-emptive strike.

03:43:00.560 --> 03:43:05.560
He'd go on to say that he was over it by the 19th of December in a video regarding Zach Choi.

03:43:05.560 --> 03:43:10.560
And I literally, I told him, I remember telling him in the car when we almost pulled up to her place,

03:43:10.560 --> 03:43:13.560
I was just like, and by the way, I don't want to think about it anymore, it's off my chest,

03:43:13.560 --> 03:43:15.560
it's done it over with, it is what it is.

03:43:15.560 --> 03:43:20.560
But that doesn't explain why he uploaded a video called I'm Exposing Someone on the 20th.

03:43:22.560 --> 03:43:25.560
But some people need a good reality check.

03:43:25.560 --> 03:43:28.560
Excuse me, I don't even like exposing people.

03:43:29.560 --> 03:43:31.560
It's so exhausting and stuff, but...

03:43:34.560 --> 03:43:36.560
I was really screwed over, so...

03:43:37.560 --> 03:43:42.560
Nick indulged in the exposed culture, he made multiple videos exposing individuals,

03:43:42.560 --> 03:43:45.560
he gave people the idea that this is what he enjoyed,

03:43:45.560 --> 03:43:49.560
and then was exposed in the process of attempting to expose someone else,

03:43:49.560 --> 03:43:53.560
and then went ahead with attempting to expose them anyway, only further exposing himself.

03:43:53.560 --> 03:43:57.560
Nick's whole brand was under fire, so his multiple personas seemed to go into overdrive.

03:43:57.560 --> 03:44:04.560
I'm not looking to convince you not to watch him or that he's terrible,

03:44:04.560 --> 03:44:13.560
I'm just letting you know that my soul tells me that he helped Chicken Nugget bring this onto me.

03:44:14.560 --> 03:44:22.560
They're both very smart, they're so smart, and they know how the internet works,

03:44:22.560 --> 03:44:28.560
they know exactly what to say to be very careful,

03:44:28.560 --> 03:44:32.560
but enough that allows people to draw the conclusions.

03:44:32.560 --> 03:44:36.560
On the commentary front, Nick uploaded multiple more videos responding to people,

03:44:36.560 --> 03:44:39.560
he says he was set up, but no one really bought it.

03:44:39.560 --> 03:44:43.560
The DMs don't come out in his favour, his own evidence doesn't come out in his favour.

03:44:43.560 --> 03:44:46.560
One DM that I often think is overlooked is this one.

03:44:46.560 --> 03:44:50.560
When Stephanie apologises for any misunderstanding in the group chat with Zack,

03:44:50.560 --> 03:44:52.560
and states that she was not comfortable talking about Veronica,

03:44:52.560 --> 03:44:56.560
Nick appeals to the comments that she made on Saturday at her home.

03:44:56.560 --> 03:45:00.560
If she was egging this discourse of Veronica on up until the video on Sunday,

03:45:00.560 --> 03:45:05.560
as Nick claims, why would he not bring that up as a much more obvious example?

03:45:05.560 --> 03:45:08.560
Well, it's because Zack wasn't there on Saturday.

03:45:09.560 --> 03:45:13.560
Why would Nick appeal to Zack's ignorance rather than his knowledge?

03:45:13.560 --> 03:45:18.560
Well, in my opinion, it's because Zack knows that she wasn't egging it on when he was there.

03:45:18.560 --> 03:45:23.560
With this in mind, it doesn't surprise me that Zack snapped when hearing Nick's narrative.

03:45:23.560 --> 03:45:27.560
Nick would make a couple more videos attacking Zack, and Zack responded.

03:45:27.560 --> 03:45:33.560
Nick would concoct the narrative that he was, in fact, set up by both Stephanie and Zack due to a business partnership,

03:45:33.560 --> 03:45:36.560
but that would mean that Zack would have needed to predict Nick dropping him in it

03:45:36.560 --> 03:45:41.560
and leaking DMs without asking permission, and if Nick knew he was being dropped in it,

03:45:41.560 --> 03:45:43.560
why would he appeal to Zack's authority?

03:45:43.560 --> 03:45:47.560
To me, it seemed like he was trying to create hostility between Stephanie and Zack,

03:45:47.560 --> 03:45:50.560
so that Zack would be forced to side with Nick, but when that failed,

03:45:50.560 --> 03:45:53.560
he just changed the narrative so that Zack was actually in on it as well.

03:45:53.560 --> 03:45:57.560
It's hard to see why else Nick would have asked Carly for permission, but not Zack.

03:45:57.560 --> 03:46:02.560
I felt like what I was telling him, he was spoon feeding to Chicken Nugget,

03:46:02.560 --> 03:46:10.560
that he was this, oh, I'm in the middle, but I'm in the middle, talking this way to me, talking this way to her,

03:46:10.560 --> 03:46:13.560
and they are business partners, you guys.

03:46:13.560 --> 03:46:19.560
They are joining up to make a lot of money, a lot of money.

03:46:19.560 --> 03:46:22.560
Who knows how much? Tens of thousands of dollars.

03:46:22.560 --> 03:46:25.560
They are business partners. They are going to come out with a product.

03:46:25.560 --> 03:46:30.560
I don't know if they're still going to do it, but I'm telling you.

03:46:30.560 --> 03:46:35.560
It still didn't really answer the other questions and just made Nick look like a bit of a conspiracy theorist.

03:46:35.560 --> 03:46:41.560
The only thing in his favour was that Zack retained to lawyer, which to the commentator or critic would be a bit strange,

03:46:41.560 --> 03:46:44.560
but Nick did have a terrible habit of twisting his words. For example,

03:46:44.560 --> 03:46:49.560
Nick said that Zack couldn't have been a real friend because he didn't check on him when he landed after his flight.

03:46:49.560 --> 03:46:55.560
Zack said he didn't DM either Nick or Stephanie after Stephanie's video, and Nick says this,

03:46:56.560 --> 03:47:00.560
and show how you guys were so comfortable with me, yet you still hung out with me and drove me around

03:47:00.560 --> 03:47:04.560
and tried to pull information out of me every chance you could get.

03:47:04.560 --> 03:47:08.560
So how could you have stayed out of it totally and never texted again?

03:47:08.560 --> 03:47:14.560
Which, again, is not believable, but yet we've heard from Chicken Nugget that the opposite happened,

03:47:14.560 --> 03:47:21.560
that literally you were talking to her, you apologised, you gave permission to release more texts for her second video.

03:47:21.560 --> 03:47:24.560
It's like, um, that's a lie.

03:47:24.560 --> 03:47:29.560
It just reminds me of that guy who, when you ask why he wasn't early for the meeting, he says,

03:47:29.560 --> 03:47:32.560
Well, I was here last week, which was very early.

03:47:32.560 --> 03:47:38.560
If he was sharp, he would have observed that Stephanie shows a message from Zack she alleged to have sent on the day after her video.

03:47:38.560 --> 03:47:44.560
This is a text message that Zack sent me on Sunday, December 22nd. This was the day after my video went up.

03:47:44.560 --> 03:47:49.560
But unfortunately, I can't make being Nick's lawyer my full time job. Sorry, Nicholas.

03:47:49.560 --> 03:47:52.560
I assume Zack retained a lawyer to avoid terminological hurdles,

03:47:52.560 --> 03:47:57.560
but his lawyer probably told him what any person should have told him at that point, to stop biting.

03:47:57.560 --> 03:48:04.560
However, not to be outdone, Nick uploads a video on January 23rd pretending to read a letter from Zack Choi's lawyer,

03:48:04.560 --> 03:48:06.560
which was swiftly deleted following its upload.

03:48:06.560 --> 03:48:08.560
You have been ordered to cease to sleep.

03:48:08.560 --> 03:48:15.560
In the volume in the sauce, consumption of foods that you eat on a daily basis on your social media platforms

03:48:16.560 --> 03:48:21.560
our client claims that you were negatively affecting the stretch marks on your behind and your pork belly.

03:48:21.560 --> 03:48:27.560
Our client claims that your double chin should hence be forth censored and provided its own zip code.

03:48:27.560 --> 03:48:33.560
Under threat of legal action, we demand that you cease and desist showing your pork belly and your eggplant on your social media platforms

03:48:33.560 --> 03:48:37.560
as it is a direct offense to the morals of our client and the internet and beyond.

03:48:37.560 --> 03:48:40.560
He made other responses to a couple people, but they soon fizzled out.

03:48:40.560 --> 03:48:44.560
He says there's a lot people don't know, but it seems that people knew enough about him.

03:48:44.560 --> 03:48:48.560
On the other hand, how was his melodramatic persona holding up?

03:48:48.560 --> 03:48:52.560
Well, to be fair, it led to some sensational content.

03:48:52.560 --> 03:48:55.560
You don't even know. You don't even know.

03:48:55.560 --> 03:48:58.560
And this is my cinnamon stick.

03:48:58.560 --> 03:49:02.560
And this is what's going to keep the evil spirits out, because I feel like there's evil spirits coming in, people casting spells on me.

03:49:02.560 --> 03:49:06.560
Excuse me. Excuse you. Excuse me.

03:49:06.560 --> 03:49:13.560
I am married to somebody who has a family who does witchcraft, so you better not watch out,

03:49:13.560 --> 03:49:15.560
because I'm making sure there's no voodoo happening here.

03:49:15.560 --> 03:49:19.560
I am blessing myself, clearing the energy out.

03:49:19.560 --> 03:49:21.560
Out you go to the little out the door.

03:49:21.560 --> 03:49:25.560
And guess what? That bad, bad energy can go right back to you.

03:49:25.560 --> 03:49:27.560
Bye bye. You.

03:49:27.560 --> 03:49:29.560
You don't even know what you're talking about.

03:49:29.560 --> 03:49:31.560
I'm not sorry. Not sorry.

03:49:31.560 --> 03:49:34.560
I'm not going to apologize for anything, for anyone, for any did in every way.

03:49:34.560 --> 03:49:37.560
I don't even know what people are even wanting me to be sorry for.

03:49:37.560 --> 03:49:41.560
To who? To who, Bill? To who? Sorry to who?

03:49:43.560 --> 03:49:48.560
As shown earlier in one of his Veronica Wang videos, he said he just wanted to eat and cry on his channel.

03:49:48.560 --> 03:49:52.560
This approach had separated his commentary persona from his melodramatic persona,

03:49:52.560 --> 03:49:57.560
allowing the audience to lend him credibility in spite of his outlandish behaviour.

03:49:57.560 --> 03:50:02.560
However, with his commentary credibility practically gone, he had no reason to preserve this border,

03:50:02.560 --> 03:50:07.560
and it quickly devolved into various debauchery relating to the drama, and far beyond that.

03:50:07.560 --> 03:50:13.560
But here's the kicker, when you think about it, it's the exact same cycle of his former vegan persona.

03:50:13.560 --> 03:50:19.560
Establish yourself as a credible creator on a certain issue, whether that's your own lifestyle, behaviour, or someone else's.

03:50:19.560 --> 03:50:23.560
Make multiple videos on each topic, being outspoken, opinionated, and convincing fans,

03:50:23.560 --> 03:50:27.560
by channeling assurance and confidence, even if the evidence is shaky.

03:50:27.560 --> 03:50:31.560
Eventually, this position no longer remains tenable, becoming quite apparent in the public eye,

03:50:31.560 --> 03:50:33.560
either through your own narrative, or someone else's.

03:50:33.560 --> 03:50:39.560
This is, in turn, met with a dramatised deterioration, which is absorbed into this ever-growing, more unhinged presence

03:50:39.560 --> 03:50:41.560
which amplifies the drama.

03:50:41.560 --> 03:50:43.560
Michelle Obama says pizza is a vegetable.

03:50:43.560 --> 03:50:45.560
Michelle Obama says pizza is a vegetable.

03:50:45.560 --> 03:50:47.560
Michelle Obama says pizza is a vegetable.

03:50:47.560 --> 03:50:49.560
Turkey baster, up in here.

03:50:49.560 --> 03:50:51.560
Turkey baster, up in here.

03:50:51.560 --> 03:50:53.560
Turkey baster, up in here.

03:50:53.560 --> 03:50:55.560
Why am I getting fat?

03:50:55.560 --> 03:50:57.560
Why am I getting fat? I don't know why.

03:50:57.560 --> 03:50:59.560
I eat all the food pyramids.

03:50:59.560 --> 03:51:01.560
You think it's so funny, it's not funny.

03:51:01.560 --> 03:51:04.560
I eat all the food groups.

03:51:04.560 --> 03:51:07.560
I don't exclude any food groups.

03:51:07.560 --> 03:51:09.560
I eat all the food groups.

03:51:09.560 --> 03:51:11.560
I used to only eat two.

03:51:11.560 --> 03:51:17.560
However, given the scale of this new drama, a lot of audiences just saw him swinging back and forth on his sentiments

03:51:17.560 --> 03:51:21.560
and losing complete control of his channel, even though this was his brand,

03:51:21.560 --> 03:51:23.560
and he was just cranking it all up to eleven.

03:51:23.560 --> 03:51:25.560
The thumbnails, the titles, the topics,

03:51:25.560 --> 03:51:28.560
it was hard to see why anyone would put themselves through that,

03:51:28.560 --> 03:51:33.560
but Nick did, he would even make videos mimicking the comparison compilations,

03:51:33.560 --> 03:51:35.560
asking what happened to him.

03:51:35.560 --> 03:51:39.560
With his first video on his channel being about his departure from the vegan community,

03:51:39.560 --> 03:51:45.560
many people would go back to this video and ask how he could come from such a calm, reasonable attitude to where he is today.

03:51:45.560 --> 03:51:49.560
Well, there's one more twist to this tale, my friends.

03:51:49.560 --> 03:51:58.560
With Nick's reputation finally being attacked from all angles,

03:51:58.560 --> 03:52:01.560
it seemed inevitable that some old friends may resurface.

03:52:01.560 --> 03:52:05.560
We already spoke about Star's Divine Munchies, who left a fresh input on the situation,

03:52:05.560 --> 03:52:09.560
and a couple other more recent creators who had their run-ins with Mr Avocado.

03:52:09.560 --> 03:52:12.560
These are not the stories that I find of particular interest,

03:52:12.560 --> 03:52:15.560
in fact, there is one tale that may tell us more than anything else.

03:52:15.560 --> 03:52:18.560
As you probably remember, though it's a while back now,

03:52:18.560 --> 03:52:20.560
when responding to one of Veronica's videos,

03:52:20.560 --> 03:52:25.560
Nick mainly chose to avoid a certain point relating to an email from someone by the name of Rainy Pachac.

03:52:25.560 --> 03:52:29.560
This was the person who Nick had previously copyright-striked under an alias,

03:52:29.560 --> 03:52:32.560
and attempted to conceal it for a while before coming clean,

03:52:32.560 --> 03:52:36.560
but in Rainy's new video, he showed it went much deeper than just that.

03:52:36.560 --> 03:52:40.560
Basically, I wanna say that Nick Ocado's been doing this to people for a very, very, very long time,

03:52:40.560 --> 03:52:45.560
and a lot of people have been using my footage and other people's footage recently to prove that,

03:52:45.560 --> 03:52:47.560
because these things are starting to surface,

03:52:47.560 --> 03:52:51.560
and I think people, now that Nick Ocado's kinda been exposed a little bit,

03:52:51.560 --> 03:52:56.560
people are feeling more comfortable about coming out and telling their stories about what he's done to them,

03:52:56.560 --> 03:52:59.560
and so I think I am the first person, at least on YouTube,

03:52:59.560 --> 03:53:03.560
that he has started this attacking pattern of his with.

03:53:03.560 --> 03:53:06.560
He would eat like 19 avocados in a mukbang,

03:53:06.560 --> 03:53:09.560
and he was in this community called the Low Fat Raw Vegan Community.

03:53:09.560 --> 03:53:12.560
Low fat, high carb, that's what we eat, right?

03:53:12.560 --> 03:53:14.560
And he's eating a ton of avocados,

03:53:14.560 --> 03:53:16.560
so he had people being like,

03:53:16.560 --> 03:53:18.560
yo bro, you should probably not eat so many avocados,

03:53:18.560 --> 03:53:21.560
and being Nick, he takes everything super personally,

03:53:21.560 --> 03:53:22.560
didn't like that one bit,

03:53:22.560 --> 03:53:25.560
so he was at war with this community, right?

03:53:25.560 --> 03:53:28.560
And so he was making drama videos about how he can eat high fat,

03:53:28.560 --> 03:53:30.560
and it's fine, and blah blah blah,

03:53:30.560 --> 03:53:32.560
and yeah, I agree, you can eat however you want.

03:53:32.560 --> 03:53:34.560
That's not where our beef came from.

03:53:34.560 --> 03:53:38.560
Our beef came from him using this drama on Facebook

03:53:38.560 --> 03:53:40.560
to plug his YouTube channel.

03:53:40.560 --> 03:53:43.560
I just felt like it was shady, it wasn't done with integrity,

03:53:43.560 --> 03:53:46.560
but I came up to him in private message and said,

03:53:46.560 --> 03:53:50.560
yo, inspect your integrity, you're making a lot of drama on Facebook

03:53:50.560 --> 03:53:53.560
and using it to plug your YouTube channel to get more views.

03:53:53.560 --> 03:53:55.560
I felt like I was friends enough with him

03:53:55.560 --> 03:53:57.560
where I could give a little constructive criticism,

03:53:57.560 --> 03:53:59.560
but no, I couldn't, that was a big mistake.

03:53:59.560 --> 03:54:01.560
That really, really pissed him off.

03:54:01.560 --> 03:54:03.560
Yes, and he comes with a fair few receipts of his own.

03:54:03.560 --> 03:54:07.560
So in the coming days after that, I get a strike on my YouTube channel.

03:54:07.560 --> 03:54:12.560
It says, Carlos Plaus put a strike on this video,

03:54:12.560 --> 03:54:14.560
said that you used footage that was his.

03:54:14.560 --> 03:54:18.560
It was actually a YouTube video where I did use somebody else's footage.

03:54:18.560 --> 03:54:20.560
I didn't really know what I was doing back then.

03:54:20.560 --> 03:54:22.560
I shouldn't have done it, but it wasn't Carlos Plaus.

03:54:22.560 --> 03:54:25.560
It was not somebody named Carlos Plaus' footage.

03:54:25.560 --> 03:54:30.560
So I look into Carlos Plaus, I find out that the only comments it's ever made,

03:54:30.560 --> 03:54:34.560
the only channel it's had any engagement on is Nikocado's,

03:54:34.560 --> 03:54:35.560
and the comments were ridiculous.

03:54:35.560 --> 03:54:37.560
They were like, oh my God, you're so amazing.

03:54:37.560 --> 03:54:39.560
You're like the coolest YouTuber ever.

03:54:39.560 --> 03:54:42.560
And it became painfully obvious that it was a fake account

03:54:42.560 --> 03:54:46.560
and Nik was using it to not only put a strike on my channel,

03:54:46.560 --> 03:54:49.560
but to garner support, fake support on his own channel.

03:54:49.560 --> 03:54:53.560
And so I asked him, hey Nik, this Carlos Plaus guy seems to like you a lot.

03:54:53.560 --> 03:54:56.560
Will you ask him to, maybe because he's so much of your fan,

03:54:56.560 --> 03:54:59.560
will you ask him maybe to please take this strike off my channel?

03:54:59.560 --> 03:55:01.560
And he's like, yeah, sure, of course.

03:55:01.560 --> 03:55:03.560
And he was like, oh, after like a week went by or something.

03:55:03.560 --> 03:55:05.560
He's like, yeah, I tried. He didn't answer.

03:55:05.560 --> 03:55:08.560
I have a whole video about this. You can watch the details about this.

03:55:08.560 --> 03:55:13.560
But basically I say as a way to kind of get this copy strike off my back

03:55:13.560 --> 03:55:18.560
and also kind of prove that it's Nik, I say, hey, it's okay.

03:55:18.560 --> 03:55:21.560
I know how I can find out who it is. I'm a computer nerd. I'm a hacker.

03:55:21.560 --> 03:55:25.560
I can find out his IP address as soon as I dispute the claim.

03:55:26.560 --> 03:55:30.560
Ten minutes after I send that to Nik, the claim is taken off my YouTube account.

03:55:30.560 --> 03:55:32.560
Obviously, Nik, who did it?

03:55:32.560 --> 03:55:34.560
Nik and Orlin are totally ridiculous.

03:55:34.560 --> 03:55:36.560
They keep asking me to do things for them.

03:55:36.560 --> 03:55:39.560
Eventually I'm like, okay, no, you put a strike on my channel.

03:55:39.560 --> 03:55:41.560
I'm not doing anything for you.

03:55:41.560 --> 03:55:44.560
Maybe in the future if you apologize and Nik's really nice to me for a while,

03:55:44.560 --> 03:55:46.560
I'll start being friends with you guys again.

03:55:46.560 --> 03:55:51.560
So Nik doesn't say anything until I think the 2015 Woodstock Fruit Festival

03:55:51.560 --> 03:55:55.560
where he comes up to me on the first day, says yeah.

03:55:55.560 --> 03:55:59.560
He admits that it was me, that it was him. He apologizes.

03:55:59.560 --> 03:56:03.560
And he tells me that he did it because two reasons.

03:56:03.560 --> 03:56:06.560
One of them I will not mention because I feel like it's too personal.

03:56:06.560 --> 03:56:10.560
But one of the reasons is because he was jealous of my camera equipment

03:56:10.560 --> 03:56:13.560
and my YouTube channel and my skills and blah, blah, blah.

03:56:13.560 --> 03:56:15.560
So that kind of says a little bit of something.

03:56:15.560 --> 03:56:18.560
His whole relationship with me, all he talked about was my video equipment,

03:56:18.560 --> 03:56:20.560
my stuff, my blah, blah, blah.

03:56:20.560 --> 03:56:23.560
And he was upset, obviously. I think this is something he does.

03:56:23.560 --> 03:56:26.560
He gets upset by something and then attacks, and this is his pattern.

03:56:26.560 --> 03:56:30.560
Ultimately, what can be alleged from this video is that Nik's rather toxic attitude

03:56:30.560 --> 03:56:33.560
predated his withdrawal from the vegan community,

03:56:33.560 --> 03:56:38.560
and that ultimately after making a series of attacks against people in the raw vegan community,

03:56:38.560 --> 03:56:42.560
he subsequently departed, attacking many others, including Rainey himself.

03:56:42.560 --> 03:56:45.560
Here's why, after nine videos of praise,

03:56:45.560 --> 03:56:49.560
he makes three videos trying to destroy the Woodstock Fruit Festival.

03:56:49.560 --> 03:56:51.560
He started eating cooked food,

03:56:51.560 --> 03:56:55.560
and some people within the community had some stuff to say about that.

03:56:55.560 --> 03:56:57.560
Stupid stuff to say, I will admit.

03:56:57.560 --> 03:56:59.560
They said things like, oh, he's lost his way.

03:56:59.560 --> 03:57:02.560
Oh, he's fallen off the path, fallen off the wagon.

03:57:02.560 --> 03:57:05.560
He's returned to eating toxic food.

03:57:05.560 --> 03:57:09.560
He makes many videos about how raw food is bad, an eating disorder,

03:57:09.560 --> 03:57:11.560
and how raw vegans are insane,

03:57:11.560 --> 03:57:15.560
and how the Woodstock Fruit Festival, the largest fruit festival in the world,

03:57:15.560 --> 03:57:19.560
is a freaking insane place where they starve their volunteers,

03:57:19.560 --> 03:57:21.560
and they pull coconuts out of the trash,

03:57:21.560 --> 03:57:23.560
and make food out of them,

03:57:23.560 --> 03:57:26.560
and feed them to the people who are paying way too much money,

03:57:26.560 --> 03:57:28.560
and they wouldn't let him have a wedding there,

03:57:28.560 --> 03:57:31.560
and he insinuated it was because he was gay,

03:57:31.560 --> 03:57:33.560
and all this stuff because he got offended.

03:57:33.560 --> 03:57:36.560
He's now trying to destroy, destroy, destroy.

03:57:36.560 --> 03:57:38.560
This is his pattern. This is what he does.

03:57:38.560 --> 03:57:40.560
I work with the Woodstock Fruit Festival.

03:57:40.560 --> 03:57:44.560
I'm their videographer, and so I'm making a video to defend them.

03:57:44.560 --> 03:57:47.560
I'm working with them to defend them, and here's where I mess up.

03:57:47.560 --> 03:57:51.560
I make the mistake of talking on Facebook about making this video.

03:57:51.560 --> 03:57:53.560
I say, hey, I'm going to make this video.

03:57:53.560 --> 03:57:56.560
I'm going to work with a doctor to prove that he's lying about the herpes thing.

03:57:56.560 --> 03:57:57.560
That's not what I should have done.

03:57:57.560 --> 03:58:00.560
I should have kept it private and just come out with the video.

03:58:00.560 --> 03:58:03.560
All of this would have been very different had I done that,

03:58:03.560 --> 03:58:07.560
but no, I had to let people know that I was making the video, so it alerted Nick,

03:58:07.560 --> 03:58:13.560
so what he did was made a 40-minute long video to try to get people to distrust me.

03:58:13.560 --> 03:58:15.560
It's like war with this kid.

03:58:15.560 --> 03:58:20.560
Like, if you slip up a little bit, he's going to take advantage of that to the fullest,

03:58:20.560 --> 03:58:25.560
to try to destroy you, to ruin your reputation, to get people to not trust you,

03:58:25.560 --> 03:58:29.560
and I think this is the first time he did it, unless he was doing this in high school too. Who knows?

03:58:29.560 --> 03:58:33.560
Rainy links an old response he wrote to the video, which Nick had uploaded,

03:58:33.560 --> 03:58:38.560
and also shows emails in which Nick had attempted to convince Rainy to remove his side of the drama.

03:58:38.560 --> 03:58:42.560
Rainy made the logical assumption that this sudden change was due to Nick coming under fire

03:58:42.560 --> 03:58:46.560
from other vegan commentators like The Vegan Cheater and Martin Lewis.

03:58:46.560 --> 03:58:49.560
Interestingly, Martin had spoken about his own experience with Nick

03:58:49.560 --> 03:58:51.560
in an older video with receipts of his own.

03:58:51.560 --> 03:58:54.560
With my accounts. Now, I have a few other fake accounts,

03:58:54.560 --> 03:58:57.560
where they're run by me, but it's not really me.

03:58:57.560 --> 03:58:59.560
They have like no photos, or it's like a random photo.

03:58:59.560 --> 03:59:01.560
Some of them have friends, some of them don't.

03:59:01.560 --> 03:59:06.560
It's a technique that I actually learned from them, which is ironic,

03:59:06.560 --> 03:59:10.560
to have other accounts to help you along, start controversy,

03:59:10.560 --> 03:59:14.560
you know, make fun of yourself, have your fans or followers defend you.

03:59:14.560 --> 03:59:18.560
It stirs things up. Start controversy, start controversy, start controversy.

03:59:18.560 --> 03:59:23.560
Here you have Nicholas posting on Facebook, trying to fool everyone,

03:59:23.560 --> 03:59:28.560
and make out that I have a fake account, when in actual reality,

03:59:28.560 --> 03:59:35.560
he's the one who creates fake accounts to start shitting people so he can get more publicity.

03:59:35.560 --> 03:59:39.560
He tried to damage my reputation by saying I had a fake account, when I never did.

03:59:39.560 --> 03:59:48.560
He's done like sneaky, snakey-ish, deliberately said things to make it look like I had a fake account,

03:59:48.560 --> 03:59:53.560
when I never ever told him that I had a fake account, because I didn't.

03:59:53.560 --> 03:59:57.560
In range description, there are links to various uploads that have withstood the test of time,

03:59:57.560 --> 04:00:00.560
including one of Nick's about the Woodstock Food Festival.

04:00:00.560 --> 04:00:04.560
And oh boy, a lot may have changed, but Nick hasn't.

04:00:04.560 --> 04:00:08.560
Obviously, the festival's struggling, and I want to draw in people by making videos.

04:00:08.560 --> 04:00:10.560
My videos have gotten tens of thousands of views.

04:00:10.560 --> 04:00:13.560
It's gotten more views than the official Woodstock promo video.

04:00:13.560 --> 04:00:16.560
There are people from my gym, people that follow me on YouTube,

04:00:16.560 --> 04:00:18.560
that said, I'm going to come to the festival because of these videos.

04:00:18.560 --> 04:00:21.560
This looks like amazing. It was basically a promotion show for them.

04:00:21.560 --> 04:00:26.560
Because I did have a good time, and I was happy to be there as Mike Vosity's assistant,

04:00:26.560 --> 04:00:29.560
but at the same time, that doesn't mean I didn't see all the shit that went on.

04:00:29.560 --> 04:00:32.560
And like, I feel like people deserve to know the truth.

04:00:32.560 --> 04:00:41.560
The Woodstock chef ordered Orlin and other people to go digging through the garbage cans to find coconuts

04:00:41.560 --> 04:00:44.560
that they were just going to blend up and turn into a cake.

04:00:44.560 --> 04:00:49.560
Their cake was made from the trash, and it wasn't until that festival ended

04:00:49.560 --> 04:00:53.560
that Orlin now has what we call hoppers, because they hop from place to place.

04:00:53.560 --> 04:00:55.560
He has herpes in his mouth. He's never had herpes.

04:00:55.560 --> 04:00:58.560
And a lot of you are going to be like, oh, well, that's common, that's this and that.

04:00:58.560 --> 04:01:01.560
It's like, no, this is malpractice. They could get sued for this.

04:01:01.560 --> 04:01:03.560
They're feeding people shit from the trash.

04:01:03.560 --> 04:01:06.560
There's been a lot of talk about what happened to Nick.

04:01:06.560 --> 04:01:10.560
But to be honest, not much happened. He merely adapted to new communities.

04:01:10.560 --> 04:01:13.560
Claiming the communities changed him, claiming the lifestyle changed him,

04:01:13.560 --> 04:01:16.560
claiming the food changed him would simply be false.

04:01:16.560 --> 04:01:19.560
I'm not entirely sure why he approaches these things the way he does.

04:01:19.560 --> 04:01:23.560
Maybe it's for the fanatical followers. They've certainly been a permanent fixture.

04:01:23.560 --> 04:01:24.560
You should be careful.

04:01:24.560 --> 04:01:28.560
Nick Ocado is one of the most powerful mukbangers, and he could press charges.

04:01:28.560 --> 04:01:32.560
You need to grow up and say you're sorry before something bad happens to you.

04:01:32.560 --> 04:01:35.560
With these conflicts, a cycle appears to arise.

04:01:35.560 --> 04:01:39.560
He was part of something, he left it, he attacked it, and then he moved on.

04:01:39.560 --> 04:01:42.560
He did that with the raw vegan community, he did that with the vegan community,

04:01:42.560 --> 04:01:45.560
and eventually he went on to do that with other YouTubers.

04:01:45.560 --> 04:01:49.560
That's not an option with his current brand, because he's transcended a community

04:01:49.560 --> 04:01:52.560
and emerged as an individual, put his reputation on the line,

04:01:52.560 --> 04:01:54.560
and that will probably follow him into any community.

04:01:54.560 --> 04:01:56.560
It's not something that he can just up and leave,

04:01:56.560 --> 04:02:00.560
which is probably why he's taken a slightly different approach to this drama.

04:02:04.560 --> 04:02:06.560
Another creator who briefly dropped in to leave her thoughts

04:02:06.560 --> 04:02:09.560
was one of Nick's earliest friends and collaborators, Brianna Jackson.

04:02:09.560 --> 04:02:12.560
She's also a former vegan, however, when Nick left the community,

04:02:12.560 --> 04:02:15.560
she made a video responding to this decision.

04:02:15.560 --> 04:02:19.560
A lot of comments insinuating that I'm a hypocrite, you know,

04:02:19.560 --> 04:02:22.560
because I've come out and I'm no longer vegan anymore,

04:02:22.560 --> 04:02:28.560
when three years ago I made a video about Nikocado Avocado not being vegan anymore.

04:02:28.560 --> 04:02:33.560
So there's some things I have to say on this, some things to get off my chest.

04:02:33.560 --> 04:02:37.560
In her new video, she responds to people asking her to apologise to Nick

04:02:37.560 --> 04:02:40.560
as she subsequently made the decision to leave veganism behind as well,

04:02:40.560 --> 04:02:43.560
while sharing some voice memos of her own.

04:02:43.560 --> 04:02:48.560
Because people are acting like they know everything about the situation,

04:02:48.560 --> 04:02:53.560
as if they know all about our friendship, all about me, all about Nick and what happened,

04:02:53.560 --> 04:02:58.560
and they've just made this decision that I'm the one that must apologise, you know?

04:02:58.560 --> 04:03:04.560
And for anyone that doesn't know, Nick is not just some random person that I made a video about,

04:03:04.560 --> 04:03:05.560
we were friends.

04:03:05.560 --> 04:03:10.560
I went travelling with him for three months during summer 2016.

04:03:10.560 --> 04:03:14.560
We went to Thailand, we went to Bali, we did everything together.

04:03:14.560 --> 04:03:19.560
We shared a bed, we shared food, we literally spent the whole day together.

04:03:19.560 --> 04:03:22.560
There weren't many times that we were apart.

04:03:22.560 --> 04:03:27.560
So a lot happened between us, a lot of things that you guys don't know.

04:03:27.560 --> 04:03:32.560
And leaving a comment like that, you're assuming you know everything about the friendship,

04:03:32.560 --> 04:03:35.560
and acting like you're the one that needs to apologise,

04:03:35.560 --> 04:03:39.560
when you don't know anything about our friendship, you don't know what happened,

04:03:39.560 --> 04:03:44.560
you don't know the shit that he did to me, and why our friendship broke up.

04:03:44.560 --> 04:03:48.560
And yes, in that video, I was acting like we were still friends,

04:03:48.560 --> 04:03:52.560
because I wasn't ready to tell you guys that we weren't friends on that video.

04:03:52.560 --> 04:03:58.560
That video was about promoting veganism, and I didn't want to come across as this crazy person who hated him.

04:03:58.560 --> 04:04:00.560
But yes, I did hate him at the time.

04:04:00.560 --> 04:04:03.560
Do I hate him now? No.

04:04:03.560 --> 04:04:06.560
But will I ever forgive him for what he did to me? No.

04:04:06.560 --> 04:04:09.560
And will I apologise to him? Hell fucking no.

04:04:09.560 --> 04:04:15.560
You're not going to know the full story, but you're going to hear some of the shit that he said to me.

04:04:15.560 --> 04:04:20.560
You don't realise how you come across to people.

04:04:20.560 --> 04:04:23.560
You look like a miserable, wet dog.

04:04:23.560 --> 04:04:25.560
Even Ellie said she's always asking you.

04:04:25.560 --> 04:04:29.560
And you have this disgusting scowl on your face all the time when we're going to restaurants.

04:04:29.560 --> 04:04:35.560
Look, Brianna, if you're antisocial, and you're so fucking out of it sometimes,

04:04:35.560 --> 04:04:39.560
you didn't even see the camera in the kitchen recording me asking you questions.

04:04:39.560 --> 04:04:41.560
You didn't see any of it.

04:04:41.560 --> 04:04:47.560
I have dozens of videos of you treating me like shit, ignoring me, giving me smartass responses.

04:04:47.560 --> 04:04:53.560
The convo of you asking me why, the convo of me asking why you lied about the collab video.

04:04:53.560 --> 04:04:57.560
The parts of the mukbangs reacted like a negative bump in the log. I have all of it.

04:04:57.560 --> 04:05:00.560
You acted like an entitled brat.

04:05:00.560 --> 04:05:04.560
So, I have the screenshots. I have Ellie's phone call recorded.

04:05:04.560 --> 04:05:07.560
You have made both of us uncomfortable.

04:05:07.560 --> 04:05:10.560
Once again, it has this highly accusatory undertone,

04:05:10.560 --> 04:05:13.560
and although there is strictly one side to this story on show here,

04:05:13.560 --> 04:05:15.560
and she said she doesn't really have too much else to add,

04:05:15.560 --> 04:05:21.560
Rainey also shared DMs where Brianna stated that she had previously received a completely different impression

04:05:21.560 --> 04:05:25.560
to the one presented by Nick, with the other DMs we've seen, some of which presented by Nick himself,

04:05:25.560 --> 04:05:28.560
seem to maintain the theme that he has a habit of poisoning the well.

04:05:28.560 --> 04:05:31.560
When it comes to other creators, that's obviously a more personal issue.

04:05:31.560 --> 04:05:34.560
When paired with the other observed actions,

04:05:34.560 --> 04:05:38.560
it seems like an excellent alienation tactic if those people were ever exposed.

04:05:38.560 --> 04:05:42.560
After all, the mukbang king shall banquish whom he wishes.

04:05:42.560 --> 04:05:48.560
For the record, the girl that he mentioned in those voice notes who apparently hated me, Ellie,

04:05:48.560 --> 04:05:52.560
she's still one of my best friends. I just saw her in November in Florida.

04:05:52.560 --> 04:06:01.560
We are very good. So yeah, he did a lot of shit to me that showed me that I would never, ever trust him again.

04:06:01.560 --> 04:06:04.560
All of these individuals are aware of the flaws within the community,

04:06:04.560 --> 04:06:09.560
and outwardly state that there are those who are toxic, who have probably helped precipitate the situation themselves.

04:06:09.560 --> 04:06:12.560
As noted, such lifestyles can breed fanaticism.

04:06:12.560 --> 04:06:18.560
However, it seems that Nikocado thrived on these sentiments as much as many of his quote haters.

04:06:18.560 --> 04:06:23.560
People fighting, people making videos about who texted who, who cheated on who, who said what,

04:06:23.560 --> 04:06:26.560
taking screenshots of comments from months ago and making dramatic videos about it.

04:06:26.560 --> 04:06:31.560
Like, if that is evident with just a few thousand people in the world who have gone vegan,

04:06:31.560 --> 04:06:34.560
then if the whole world is vegan, we are not saved.

04:06:34.560 --> 04:06:38.560
When Nikocado made that video announcing his departure, he may have seemed reasonable.

04:06:38.560 --> 04:06:42.560
He may have been looking for a fresh start, but the subsequent devolution of his behaviour

04:06:42.560 --> 04:06:47.560
and the consequences that ensued wasn't a new development, it was a return to old habits.

04:06:47.560 --> 04:06:53.560
And old habits die hard. But was Nik about to try and cull them? Let's find out.

04:06:59.560 --> 04:07:03.560
Nik didn't really have much commentary credibility to salvage at this point.

04:07:03.560 --> 04:07:07.560
Throughout January 2020, he had done nothing but aggravate the situation,

04:07:07.560 --> 04:07:11.560
and by the time February came around, it didn't look like he was going to make it any easier for himself.

04:07:11.560 --> 04:07:16.560
This is Hushbang, the uploaded content that was similar to a lot of Mukbang compilation channels.

04:07:16.560 --> 04:07:21.560
Now, as I understand, they had uploaded multiple videos covering Nikocado Avocado's drama.

04:07:21.560 --> 04:07:26.560
It seemed Nik wasn't happy about this, and decided to send multiple copyright strikes to this channel.

04:07:26.560 --> 04:07:32.560
Hushbang subsequently privated all these videos and made a community post stating that they would be explaining

04:07:32.560 --> 04:07:37.560
why soon. Nik then replied sardonically, commenting on the post that he's looking forward to it.

04:07:37.560 --> 04:07:42.560
Many of Nik's strongest critics quickly jumped onto this, observing the hypocrisy given the narratives

04:07:42.560 --> 04:07:44.560
he espoused in his Veronica Wang uploads.

04:07:45.560 --> 04:07:51.560
Folks, Nikocado isn't in the wrong. He can copyright strike any channel he wants, like ever.

04:07:51.560 --> 04:07:57.560
He has the right to even strike CNN if he wants, because Nikocado Avocado can do whatever he wants.

04:07:57.560 --> 04:08:03.560
One of these critics was Veronica Wang herself, who expressed anger at the abandonment of such principles,

04:08:03.560 --> 04:08:07.560
given how he'd mobilised them so assertively against her. A few days later,

04:08:07.560 --> 04:08:10.560
Nik would go on drama alert to be interviewed by Keemstar and Leafy.

04:08:10.560 --> 04:08:14.560
Nik maintained his position and responded to some of Keemstar's quite reasonable observations,

04:08:14.560 --> 04:08:17.560
by making statements which I feel weren't entirely honest.

04:08:18.560 --> 04:08:20.560
100%. 100%.

04:08:21.560 --> 04:08:27.560
But, but Stephanie could also say, I only included that so you could better understand why I felt the way I did, right?

04:08:27.560 --> 04:08:30.560
So there's always two sides to every story, but...

04:08:30.560 --> 04:08:37.560
That's pretty extreme. I've never done that to someone where I pull out like that type of seriousness

04:08:37.560 --> 04:08:41.560
to, you know, say, oh, I felt a certain way. I mean, that's just going to the extreme.

04:08:41.560 --> 04:08:46.560
That's really, that means that you need more to add to the argument to make it a video.

04:08:46.560 --> 04:08:50.560
Then Leafy joins, and well, what did you think was going to happen?

04:08:50.560 --> 04:08:53.560
I don't have the energy. It's because I'm sick.

04:08:53.560 --> 04:08:56.560
But I'm your number one fan.

04:08:56.560 --> 04:08:59.560
You're my number one fan? What?

04:08:59.560 --> 04:09:03.560
It's really helped me get through tough times and whatnot.

04:09:03.560 --> 04:09:07.560
I don't believe you. I'm sorry. I don't believe you. I mean, no offense, but there's no way you are.

04:09:07.560 --> 04:09:09.560
I am being 100% honest.

04:09:09.560 --> 04:09:11.560
Leafy, why do you like it?

04:09:11.560 --> 04:09:13.560
I'm in a doctor's bed right now.

04:09:13.560 --> 04:09:17.560
He also said this regarding a prospective apology for his alleged misdeeds.

04:09:17.560 --> 04:09:20.560
If I am going through stuff and I'm going to express it, or if I'm not sorry,

04:09:20.560 --> 04:09:24.560
or people want me to be sorry for something I didn't even fucking do,

04:09:24.560 --> 04:09:27.560
how is that genuine or good YouTube content? I don't understand.

04:09:27.560 --> 04:09:32.560
However, a few days later, he uploaded a one and a half hour long video called I'm Sorry.

04:09:32.560 --> 04:09:35.560
Though not apologizing for any specific drama that instigated his reaction,

04:09:35.560 --> 04:09:38.560
he does apologize for some of his subsequent behaviour,

04:09:38.560 --> 04:09:41.560
while also explaining why he behaved in a certain way.

04:09:41.560 --> 04:09:46.560
He also discusses some changes in his life that he's been making to hopefully help him improve.

04:09:46.560 --> 04:09:55.560
I have messed up a lot over the past six months.

04:09:55.560 --> 04:09:58.560
I have messed up my whole life, actually. Let's take that back.

04:09:58.560 --> 04:10:00.560
My whole life has been bad.

04:10:00.560 --> 04:10:08.560
This past week or two especially has been I just need to apologize for everything.

04:10:08.560 --> 04:10:13.560
I just am embarrassed.

04:10:13.560 --> 04:10:18.560
This is not a good apology. That's also why I've been afraid to say something.

04:10:18.560 --> 04:10:21.560
Because it's also excuses.

04:10:21.560 --> 04:10:28.560
I mean, I am sorry that I'm telling you that I'm not happy with how I behave on the internet sometimes.

04:10:28.560 --> 04:10:32.560
But I'm also, I feel like I need to tell you why and give you my perspective,

04:10:32.560 --> 04:10:34.560
but then it comes across as an excuse.

04:10:34.560 --> 04:10:38.560
But then if I don't tell you, then you think I'm just fully off the rock or deranged.

04:10:38.560 --> 04:10:42.560
I'm not, but I don't know.

04:10:42.560 --> 04:10:53.560
I don't know what I need to say to make people feel better other than I'm sorry.

04:10:53.560 --> 04:10:54.560
I'm very sorry.

04:10:54.560 --> 04:10:58.560
Knowing that everyone thinks I'm the victim, not the victim, the villain,

04:10:58.560 --> 04:11:02.560
and then me saying, well, if I'm the villain, let me be the villain.

04:11:02.560 --> 04:11:07.560
I have no problem. I know who I am. I have no problem doing something.

04:11:07.560 --> 04:11:11.560
You know, it's like, it's all of those things combined.

04:11:11.560 --> 04:11:14.560
Like, I'm mentally not well. I'm physically not well.

04:11:14.560 --> 04:11:17.560
I'm frying my brain. My relationship isn't good.

04:11:17.560 --> 04:11:22.560
I'm naturally extra and emotional, but I also have a lot of flaws to who I am.

04:11:22.560 --> 04:11:23.560
And I've made some mistakes.

04:11:23.560 --> 04:11:27.560
And then I've also exaggerated stuff because I know I've got a reaction.

04:11:27.560 --> 04:11:31.560
But YouTube, you know, it spreads my channel when people make more videos about me.

04:11:31.560 --> 04:11:35.560
And it's like, it goes even further. It's kind of a mess.

04:11:35.560 --> 04:11:40.560
I went to therapy today. Wow.

04:11:40.560 --> 04:11:44.560
First of all, I'm very lucky to have a therapist on Sundays.

04:11:44.560 --> 04:11:49.560
Second of all, I'm lucky to have such a grounded, smart person.

04:11:49.560 --> 04:11:53.560
I talked about it in yesterday's video, my third channel, how it's just like people.

04:11:53.560 --> 04:11:58.560
I didn't think I needed it. I always said I'm very analytical and thought provoking.

04:11:58.560 --> 04:12:02.560
And I like to, even though I don't appear that way on YouTube, that's also my character.

04:12:02.560 --> 04:12:08.560
I just, I'm very analytical and stuff, but I never, I took me by surprise.

04:12:08.560 --> 04:12:15.560
The fact that there's someone else that could be offering you insight to things that you would have thought of initially.

04:12:15.560 --> 04:12:19.560
And you're not as smart as yourself. And sometimes you have to hear it from someone else.

04:12:19.560 --> 04:12:27.560
So I'm addressing medication. I'm addressing, which again, I don't know if you're going to notice any differences in my mukbangs going forward.

04:12:27.560 --> 04:12:33.560
You know, all medicines have side effects and stuff, and I don't want people, I don't want that.

04:12:33.560 --> 04:12:39.560
I just kinda, I want you to know that I have various people in my life helping me,

04:12:39.560 --> 04:12:45.560
and I have various tools in my life to help me fix all the things that are going on.

04:12:45.560 --> 04:12:49.560
These accounts made sense to some people, however others weren't quite as convinced,

04:12:49.560 --> 04:12:55.560
not believing his rationale stood under scrutiny, such as his reasoning regarding the Kobe Bryant escapades.

04:12:55.560 --> 04:13:02.560
I, right hand, I know it's my left hand, right hand up to God.

04:13:02.560 --> 04:13:10.560
I did not know who he was. Never heard of him in my life. You name any sport player, I'm not going to know a thing about them.

04:13:10.560 --> 04:13:18.560
I just don't know. And that was the first time I heard of him. And Kobe, spelled that way, was the first, it's not a common name.

04:13:18.560 --> 04:13:25.560
I never, it wasn't something, I can barely even remember, it's someone I meet five times.

04:13:25.560 --> 04:13:29.560
After admitting that a lot of this content is made for the purpose of trolling,

04:13:29.560 --> 04:13:34.560
it would be a strange decision to try and downplay other incidents, although it's hard to really buy his explanation

04:13:34.560 --> 04:13:37.560
when he addresses Bryant by such ridiculous substitutes.

04:13:37.560 --> 04:13:45.560
No, it feels like four letters, K, baby beep. Calvin? Oh, what was his name?

04:13:45.560 --> 04:13:52.560
It starts with a K, even though it sounds like it should be a C. Kenneth? I don't know, I don't think it's that long.

04:13:52.560 --> 04:13:57.560
I remember being very short, like four letters, I think there's an O in there.

04:13:57.560 --> 04:14:04.560
Kirk, Kirk, Kathy. Oh, everyone's really upset, everyone's shouting at the screen.

04:14:04.560 --> 04:14:09.560
I don't know sports, I don't know basketball, I don't, I've never heard of them before, don't come for me.

04:14:09.560 --> 04:14:11.560
I don't know sports or anything.

04:14:11.560 --> 04:14:15.560
Other people doubted the intent of this video, which after everything that's been revealed,

04:14:15.560 --> 04:14:18.560
and the following publicity stunts, is understandable.

04:14:18.560 --> 04:14:22.560
Ultimately, that part will come down to personal interpretation of his remarks.

04:14:22.560 --> 04:14:26.560
One issue he did not appear remorseful over was that regarding Hushbang,

04:14:26.560 --> 04:14:30.560
which he appeared to stand his ground on, stating that he'd be discussing it soon.

04:14:30.560 --> 04:14:38.560
I also don't want to respond to that, because I just had a meeting with my manager from Google,

04:14:38.560 --> 04:14:42.560
and we're looking into it, so that's all I'm saying.

04:14:42.560 --> 04:14:50.560
It was not false, and we are pursuing what we need to, that's that.

04:14:50.560 --> 04:14:56.560
That's all I'm going to say at this point, but it was made on the decision of a few people.

04:14:56.560 --> 04:15:01.560
However, his next video turned out to be another apology video, this time to Veronica Wang,

04:15:01.560 --> 04:15:04.560
which integrated the Hushbang discussion.

04:15:05.560 --> 04:15:08.560
There's a lot more to that story.

04:15:08.560 --> 04:15:11.560
What I'm able to talk about, because nothing has been confirmed yet,

04:15:11.560 --> 04:15:14.560
I have been speaking with the copyright team here on YouTube.

04:15:14.560 --> 04:15:18.560
I have been speaking with my manager at Google.

04:15:18.560 --> 04:15:23.560
We, or them, are evaluating it and escalating it.

04:15:23.560 --> 04:15:25.560
I have connections at YouTube, okay?

04:15:25.560 --> 04:15:34.560
I use them when I feel like I'm being targeted, and I guess I felt very targeted, and that's the truth.

04:15:34.560 --> 04:15:44.560
It's one thing where people react to me, or make comments about me, or criticize me, or say,

04:15:44.560 --> 04:15:49.560
oh, he's crazy, he's stupid, he's ...

04:15:49.560 --> 04:15:58.560
It's another thing when, out of over 100 videos on a channel, 80 of them were only about me,

04:15:58.560 --> 04:16:00.560
and I felt very targeted.

04:16:00.560 --> 04:16:05.560
Would those videos have been made if I didn't give people a reason to talk about me?

04:16:05.560 --> 04:16:12.560
No, so it's kind of like I'm eating my own pudding, I'm getting a taste of my own medicine,

04:16:12.560 --> 04:16:14.560
because what did I do to Veronica?

04:16:14.560 --> 04:16:21.560
So you add up all those videos, plus the video I made a week ago, that's a collection of videos.

04:16:21.560 --> 04:16:23.560
I can't imagine what she's feeling too.

04:16:23.560 --> 04:16:33.560
Why should I be able to feel badly, or hurt, or target, or hurt, or anything like that about a situation,

04:16:33.560 --> 04:16:36.560
but she's not allowed to with me?

04:16:36.560 --> 04:16:39.560
People seem to feel this was a more sincere apology.

04:16:39.560 --> 04:16:45.560
He once again talks a lot about his mentality, and how that yielded his behaviour, which he now sees the error in.

04:16:45.560 --> 04:16:47.560
Very Admiral Reflection, for sure.

04:16:47.560 --> 04:16:53.560
However, the cynical side of me can't help but feel that this sympathy towards Veronica Wang is a way to validate

04:16:53.560 --> 04:16:56.560
the position he has taken, while appearing selfless.

04:16:56.560 --> 04:17:01.560
Now, changing your stance with new experience and information is fine, but mass copyright strikes seem like

04:17:01.560 --> 04:17:07.560
such a weird thing to 180 on, and I'll never truly agree or provide sympathy for people who do that stuff

04:17:07.560 --> 04:17:09.560
unless it's just literal re-uploads.

04:17:09.560 --> 04:17:15.560
Mass strikes at once always feel like a calculated effort to attack a channel, rather than actually defending

04:17:15.560 --> 04:17:20.560
the content, because there are so many other ways around it, it always feels personal.

04:17:20.560 --> 04:17:24.560
With that said, the video is an hour long, and he talks about a lot, and I don't want to present the perception

04:17:24.560 --> 04:17:29.560
that it's just that, and since then Hushbang have moved on from that content and gone back to doing what

04:17:29.560 --> 04:17:32.560
they did prior, which was being a Sims channel. Good for them.

04:17:32.560 --> 04:17:37.560
As I understand, they were actually saved by YouTube's intervention, though I'm not sure how much of a hand

04:17:37.560 --> 04:17:38.560
Nick had in that.

04:17:38.560 --> 04:17:43.560
With these videos, it did seem that Nick Ocado was attempting to turn over a new leak.

04:17:43.560 --> 04:17:48.560
He advocated the distinction of his trolling persona, and it's clear he didn't want to just be remembered

04:17:48.560 --> 04:17:52.560
as a troll, but did want to sustain that side of him for entertainment purposes.

04:17:53.560 --> 04:18:01.560
I really want to just grow from this, and also let you know that there's also things that I do on purpose,

04:18:01.560 --> 04:18:06.560
I mean, because it's the internet, and I like to have fun.

04:18:06.560 --> 04:18:10.560
To many people, life is about a legacy, how one will be remembered after they're gone,

04:18:10.560 --> 04:18:15.560
whether that's internet presence or existence in general, and when facing down his legacy,

04:18:15.560 --> 04:18:20.560
Nick reacted in the way that he knew best, but now the joke was over, he still had content to create.

04:18:20.560 --> 04:18:24.560
and wanted to be more than a YouTube villain. Will he ever have that opportunity?

04:18:24.560 --> 04:18:27.560
And what can be said about this exhausting character?

04:18:32.560 --> 04:18:36.560
Nicholas, Nicholas, Nicholas, what to do with you?

04:18:36.560 --> 04:18:41.560
Let's start this part with a positive. Nick likes cheese, I really like cheese as well,

04:18:41.560 --> 04:18:44.560
cheese is great, good on you for liking cheese.

04:18:44.560 --> 04:18:47.560
When South Korea gave the world Mukbang all those years ago,

04:18:47.560 --> 04:18:51.560
few could have foreseen that it would create so many waves across many people's lives.

04:18:51.560 --> 04:18:55.560
In many ways, with consumerism considered, it shouldn't be that surprising,

04:18:55.560 --> 04:19:00.560
but there is a level of awe that I still find myself in that such a conceptually innocent idea

04:19:00.560 --> 04:19:02.560
has distorted itself into this.

04:19:02.560 --> 04:19:07.560
Nikocado was one of the first on the gravy train, making Mukbangs before he'd even quit veganism.

04:19:07.560 --> 04:19:11.560
In a way, I think Nick's Mukbangs suit him in a twisted fashion.

04:19:11.560 --> 04:19:15.560
There is something so fascinating yet so empty about its presentation.

04:19:15.560 --> 04:19:19.560
Nick hailed from fervent communities with people who were very strong willed,

04:19:19.560 --> 04:19:25.560
but Nick was equally as strong willed, and he eventually lost the allegiance to said community,

04:19:25.560 --> 04:19:30.560
channeling his passion down other avenues, and often against the communities he had previously identified with.

04:19:30.560 --> 04:19:36.560
Although he had pledged to distance himself from the drama, he gradually began to dabble more and more.

04:19:36.560 --> 04:19:40.560
After all of that toxic drama, he couldn't resist. Why is that?

04:19:40.560 --> 04:19:45.560
It's an element of me trolling for the camera because it gets people talking.

04:19:45.560 --> 04:19:48.560
The more people talk about me, the more I grow.

04:19:48.560 --> 04:19:52.560
Whether they're negative videos or not, it pushes my name in the algorithm.

04:19:52.560 --> 04:19:55.560
Nikocado Avocado, my channel just keeps getting bigger and bigger.

04:19:55.560 --> 04:20:00.560
Even if people are leaving, it's like they're coming back or they're being brought in from other people who don't know me yet.

04:20:00.560 --> 04:20:06.560
I think this quote is more important than one may initially consider it, although only partly true.

04:20:06.560 --> 04:20:09.560
I'm sure there are many reasons for why he behaves the way he does,

04:20:09.560 --> 04:20:15.560
but I think his main motive is to provoke. His rather aberrant content doesn't tend to attract more views,

04:20:15.560 --> 04:20:22.560
and never has really, it tends to alienate some audience members, and overall only loosely fits in thematically with his other content,

04:20:22.560 --> 04:20:25.560
often being a product of some other incident that spirals.

04:20:25.560 --> 04:20:31.560
Therefore, it was inevitable when everything began to spiral, so did the prevalence of this character.

04:20:31.560 --> 04:20:35.560
Nick has been doing this from the start, it's a pattern, he initiates an argument, picks a strong position,

04:20:35.560 --> 04:20:38.560
because people love strong positions, and he runs with it for better and for worse,

04:20:38.560 --> 04:20:42.560
and if it goes south, he just hits the fuck it button and loses all control.

04:20:42.560 --> 04:21:01.560
Oh my god.

04:21:01.560 --> 04:21:06.560
It hurts so bad. How dare you call me dramatic? Really? You people make me fucking sick.

04:21:06.560 --> 04:21:10.560
Get the fuck out of here. How dare you call me dramatic?

04:21:10.560 --> 04:21:17.560
Oh, yeah, what did she say? Come on. Oh, first of all, let's just bring him back. Oh, he's trying to be a little...

04:21:17.560 --> 04:21:23.560
It's entertaining, even if it makes him look like a fool, and he can make himself look like a fool because it's his reputation.

04:21:23.560 --> 04:21:29.560
In a way, it was a win-win, because if he's taken seriously and lent credibility, then he can make more videos capitalising on that,

04:21:29.560 --> 04:21:33.560
and if he's not taken seriously, then he can just turn it into a massive meme.

04:21:33.560 --> 04:21:37.560
It ultimately means that it's difficult to decipher what's real and what's not in his life.

04:21:37.560 --> 04:21:43.560
Nick claims that he lets his mood lead his content, given the daily upload schedule, and because his mood is so volatile,

04:21:43.560 --> 04:21:48.560
you'd never know what to exactly expect, and with videos every day at an exhaustive rate,

04:21:48.560 --> 04:21:54.560
his persona just amalgamates into a blur. He's never dull, but by allowing so many sides to consume him,

04:21:54.560 --> 04:21:57.560
it feels like a simulation and not a real person.

04:21:57.560 --> 04:22:01.560
I think the motive to provoke and entertain is something that pervades all this content,

04:22:01.560 --> 04:22:05.560
and I don't doubt that it was part of his motivation when making call-out videos too.

04:22:05.560 --> 04:22:09.560
Calling others out can be pretty exciting for creators and audiences alike,

04:22:09.560 --> 04:22:14.560
and there's some real feeling of righteousness that it can drive, but there is a cost for making them.

04:22:14.560 --> 04:22:18.560
Whether it's viewed by the instigator or the recipient, you're going at someone's reputation,

04:22:18.560 --> 04:22:22.560
and as Nick observes himself, that will have a lasting effect on a brand.

04:22:22.560 --> 04:22:26.560
Exposed culture is like that, and when the momentum was in his favour, Nick went with it.

04:22:26.560 --> 04:22:33.560
He set a target, he set a position, and he entertained many people who wanted to see someone problematic brought down.

04:22:33.560 --> 04:22:38.560
Nick had this fascinating approach to framing these people to be exposed as these manipulative masterminds,

04:22:38.560 --> 04:22:42.560
pulling the strings, when many of them were almost completely the opposite to me.

04:22:42.560 --> 04:22:46.560
Creators panic responding to criticism, some of which very warranted,

04:22:46.560 --> 04:22:50.560
but them clearly having no clue what to do because they've never been involved in this.

04:22:50.560 --> 04:22:53.560
A lot of creators don't respond well to strongly formed criticism.

04:22:53.560 --> 04:22:57.560
Nick targeted them and gained credibility off the back of their incompetence.

04:22:57.560 --> 04:23:02.560
Nevertheless, the content itself was opportunistic and provided an illusion of argumentative soundness,

04:23:02.560 --> 04:23:06.560
because his demeanor conveyed conviction, his responses appeared comprehensive,

04:23:06.560 --> 04:23:09.560
and his targets had often already been written off by audiences.

04:23:09.560 --> 04:23:13.560
With these other personas balanced, that was a perilous position to be in.

04:23:13.560 --> 04:23:17.560
It was only a matter of time until his narratives were placed under similar scrutiny,

04:23:17.560 --> 04:23:19.560
and the cracks were going to appear.

04:23:19.560 --> 04:23:24.560
What was truly exceptional is the nature by which it happened, an exposed video by someone who he planned to expose,

04:23:24.560 --> 04:23:30.560
a video which showcased his behaviour as aggressive, manipulative, and just all-round unpleasant,

04:23:30.560 --> 04:23:32.560
likely with the aim of cornering his subjects.

04:23:32.560 --> 04:23:35.560
Nick wonders why this couldn't have been solved by a DM.

04:23:35.560 --> 04:23:39.560
I'm sorry I reacted poorly to her standing me up.

04:23:39.560 --> 04:23:42.560
I shouldn't have messaged and called that many times,

04:23:42.560 --> 04:23:44.560
but I wanted to feel a little bit better.

04:23:44.560 --> 04:23:48.560
If she was afraid of our developing friendship, as she said in her text,

04:23:48.560 --> 04:23:52.560
for the sake of her developing friendship, I'm like, well, if you're trying to develop a friendship,

04:23:52.560 --> 04:23:54.560
you can say, hey, Nick, this is what's really up.

04:23:54.560 --> 04:23:57.560
I want to voice it to you, not, you know, keep you wondering.

04:23:58.560 --> 04:24:02.560
You know what I mean? It really wasn't that big of an issue,

04:24:02.560 --> 04:24:06.560
but now it's been blown up into this whole thing across the whole internet,

04:24:06.560 --> 04:24:11.560
and I'm going to lose money, I'm going to lose business, I'm going to lose support, I'm going to lose trust.

04:24:11.560 --> 04:24:15.560
And a couple years ago, they may have been able to talk it out before it reached a video stage,

04:24:15.560 --> 04:24:20.560
but there was no confrontation by either party, even though there was demonstrable hostility.

04:24:20.560 --> 04:24:24.560
Nick's own commitment to the culture and the focus that he dedicated to exposing people

04:24:24.560 --> 04:24:29.560
led to such a rapid disintegration of trust that there was no private resolution,

04:24:29.560 --> 04:24:33.560
particularly given Nick's public flogging of the drama before this video,

04:24:33.560 --> 04:24:38.560
and in the end, Nick exposed himself as a rather callous snake who was pursuing a friendship for the sake of tea,

04:24:38.560 --> 04:24:41.560
citing his own trash talk as evidence.

04:24:41.560 --> 04:24:44.560
He may not have done anything egregiously awful, I agree there,

04:24:44.560 --> 04:24:47.560
but the bar was lowered, partly through his own exposes.

04:24:47.560 --> 04:24:53.560
Speaking for myself, but I'd take Nick's experience with Trisha Paytas any day over Stephanie's experience with Nick.

04:24:53.560 --> 04:24:58.560
Also, there is an element of my attachment disorder showing through.

04:24:58.560 --> 04:25:02.560
I didn't want to accept that, I couldn't say, oh, whatever.

04:25:02.560 --> 04:25:07.560
I was like, no, I need to know why, what did I do, I need to be liked, I need to be accepted.

04:25:07.560 --> 04:25:11.560
So that is where some of that played into as well.

04:25:11.560 --> 04:25:22.560
I'm 26, 27 years old, I need to just say, okay, I was overtaken with not accepting rejection

04:25:22.560 --> 04:25:29.560
or no or feeling left, and it's not because I'm a predator, it's not because I have sexual tendencies,

04:25:29.560 --> 04:25:35.560
it's not because I'm a master manipulator trying to convince everyone of something,

04:25:35.560 --> 04:25:42.560
it's because I don't like being ghosted and I take it a lot harder than other people for various different reasons.

04:25:42.560 --> 04:25:51.560
And I'm sorry for that because I can't understand how that would trigger whatever she went through with whoever she went through.

04:25:51.560 --> 04:25:55.560
And this wasn't six hours without eating, this was after sleeping for nine hours.

04:25:55.560 --> 04:25:59.560
And I saw people on Twitter saying, oh gosh, poor baby, he has to not eat for five hours.

04:25:59.560 --> 04:26:04.560
It was five hours of waiting, but I hadn't eaten since the night before when we filmed her collab,

04:26:04.560 --> 04:26:06.560
which was like, I don't know, 10pm.

04:26:06.560 --> 04:26:12.560
So that's 12 hours plus 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 hours without food.

04:26:12.560 --> 04:26:15.560
The sad thing is that towards the end of his response to Stephanie Sue,

04:26:15.560 --> 04:26:19.560
Nick does begin to speak somewhat remorsefully about mistakes he made.

04:26:19.560 --> 04:26:24.560
And although I question certain elements of his argument, such as the point about mukbangers starving themselves,

04:26:24.560 --> 04:26:27.560
like the dude literally had three full meals the day before,

04:26:27.560 --> 04:26:32.560
I wish he had made this a more central element rather than what felt like a footnote.

04:26:32.560 --> 04:26:37.560
It feels he struggles with two sides of him because one moment he talks about his attachment disorder

04:26:37.560 --> 04:26:39.560
and why that makes him act more irrationally than most,

04:26:39.560 --> 04:26:43.560
and the next minute he says that most people would have reacted the way he did.

04:26:44.560 --> 04:26:55.560
I'm very, very, very sorry for making her feel like getting flashbacks to when someone convinced her not to say no,

04:26:55.560 --> 04:26:59.560
or someone pressured her into doing sexual activities.

04:26:59.560 --> 04:27:06.560
I'm sorry that I sprung, I instigated, I ignited those feelings and memories.

04:27:06.560 --> 04:27:11.560
I'm sorry, I had no idea, I had no way of knowing, she didn't tell me.

04:27:11.560 --> 04:27:17.560
And I was pissed, and I also have a problem being rejected.

04:27:17.560 --> 04:27:23.560
Why do you think I make all these videos searching for acceptance on the computer?

04:27:23.560 --> 04:27:25.560
I feel 100% justified in that reaction.

04:27:25.560 --> 04:27:29.560
I think most people would have reacted that way if they were left hanging for seven hours.

04:27:29.560 --> 04:27:34.560
I feel like people do want to get to know Nick, but no one really knows who he is.

04:27:34.560 --> 04:27:39.560
If he'd been more inclined to integrate apologetic elements, then it would have made him more human.

04:27:39.560 --> 04:27:45.560
But instead, he enshrined himself as the villain, and set himself up to be clinically taken apart because of details

04:27:45.560 --> 04:27:47.560
which he was lucidly dishonest about.

04:27:47.560 --> 04:27:52.560
Eventually, this led him to self-destruct mode, and took him down a road of performative insanity,

04:27:52.560 --> 04:27:58.560
which combined with fresh negative attention by critical audiences, cultivated a whole new reputation in itself,

04:27:58.560 --> 04:28:02.560
a reputation that Nick initially embraced before realising it was not sustainable,

04:28:02.560 --> 04:28:05.560
and attempting to patch up some wounds to compensate for his erratic behaviour.

04:28:05.560 --> 04:28:08.560
Since then, it seems he's been trying to separate the personas a little,

04:28:08.560 --> 04:28:13.560
saving most of his eccentric content for Nikocado Avocado 3, and more Nikocado,

04:28:13.560 --> 04:28:18.560
and uploading a few more serious videos on his main channel, though its content can be a little questionable.

04:28:18.560 --> 04:28:37.560
But there is one thing for certain, it is undeniably Nikocado,

04:28:37.560 --> 04:28:42.560
and over these last few months, he has continued to evolve his persona to the changing landscape.

04:28:42.560 --> 04:28:44.560
Let's conclude this then.

04:28:50.560 --> 04:28:53.560
I'm sure you people have heard a lot about OnlyFans recently,

04:28:53.560 --> 04:28:59.560
the website where some creators decide to post rather candid content in return for monetary support.

04:28:59.560 --> 04:29:05.560
Well, Nick's a guy who likes to put himself online, and his OnlyFans account takes that mantra to the next level.

04:29:05.560 --> 04:29:13.560
He uploads and advertises it on a fairly regular basis, while proudly boasting that his page is in the top 0.25% of creators on the website.

04:29:13.560 --> 04:29:17.560
Congratulations to you, Nick. Unfortunately, I did not subscribe.

04:29:17.560 --> 04:29:22.560
There's a lot of business on such a website as people aren't really too concerned with your commentary credibility,

04:29:22.560 --> 04:29:26.560
they just want the goods. With this, you could say that Nick has been moving forward,

04:29:26.560 --> 04:29:32.560
but a lot of the stigma has persisted, with him being called out for any actions which could be classed as problematic.

04:29:32.560 --> 04:29:37.560
He recently ended up in hot water involving my good friend James Marriott, and the drama channel Spill.

04:29:37.560 --> 04:29:42.560
Marriott made content reacting to Nick's OnlyFans content, and Nick reacted to Marriott's reaction,

04:29:42.560 --> 04:29:44.560
making some flirtatious remarks.

04:29:44.560 --> 04:29:50.560
These, they're all batting for my team. I'm telling you, my radar is going ding ding ding ding ding, especially him.

04:29:50.560 --> 04:29:55.560
Especially James, hotel boy. Marriott, a good place to sleep.

04:29:55.560 --> 04:30:01.560
James then similarly responded, and people picked up on this exchange, with some taking it more seriously than others.

04:30:01.560 --> 04:30:06.560
Eventually, Spill made a video on it, however, they appeared to misrepresent some of Marriott's comments,

04:30:06.560 --> 04:30:08.560
portraying him as uncomfortable.

04:30:08.560 --> 04:30:15.560
James was uncomfortable with the comments Nick made. For example, he called out Nick for using his last name in a way.

04:30:15.560 --> 04:30:19.560
Just because my last name is a hotel, that does not mean that you can pay to with me.

04:30:19.560 --> 04:30:20.560
James was off.

04:30:20.560 --> 04:30:23.560
James clarifies this, and shows context to the clips.

04:30:23.560 --> 04:30:27.560
For example, he called out Nick for using his last name in a way.

04:30:27.560 --> 04:30:32.560
Just because my last name is a hotel, that does not mean that you can pay to with me.

04:30:32.560 --> 04:30:39.560
Right. Okay, you cannot decide if I'm uncomfortable. First of all, what I was saying was a joke.

04:30:39.560 --> 04:30:43.560
Proof of the fact that it was a joke is I'm now going to show you the clip they used in context.

04:30:43.560 --> 04:30:49.560
Just because my last name is a hotel, that does not mean that you can pay to with me unless the price is right.

04:30:49.560 --> 04:30:54.560
I literally told Mick Ocado that he could pay to with me. That is what I'm saying there.

04:30:54.560 --> 04:30:57.560
I'm not saying I'm so uncomfortable with the idea that he's going to sit with me.

04:30:57.560 --> 04:31:01.560
I literally joked about him sitting with me. That is not a man who is uncomfortable with the situation.

04:31:01.560 --> 04:31:06.560
Now, I'll admit, although I find some of Nick's OnlyFans comments a tad ill-suited,

04:31:06.560 --> 04:31:11.560
I know James, and he's a thick-skinned guy. Well, he's a bit thick in general, if you know what I'm saying.

04:31:11.560 --> 04:31:14.560
And such comments aren't really cause for a spectacle.

04:31:14.560 --> 04:31:18.560
Spill have since removed the video and apologised, which was the right thing to do.

04:31:18.560 --> 04:31:24.560
Nick himself made a response video, although I think it evoked a few too many old memories for certain audiences.

04:31:24.560 --> 04:31:29.560
Like, it's just gross. It's just gross. I'm just mad. I see these comments and I get so upset.

04:31:29.560 --> 04:31:31.560
I'm sending this all to a lawyer.

04:31:31.560 --> 04:31:34.560
Never letting off on the receipts in title trope, are we?

04:31:34.560 --> 04:31:37.560
Of course, evoking the past trends make it harder to escape it,

04:31:37.560 --> 04:31:41.560
and he does receive some pretty cruel comments from people coming across his content,

04:31:41.560 --> 04:31:45.560
which does kinda make me feel sad. It obviously doesn't help that he tends to focus on them,

04:31:45.560 --> 04:31:50.560
and talk about how you definitely shouldn't do it because it upsets him a lot in a baiting fashion,

04:31:50.560 --> 04:31:52.560
but such is the cycle of provocation.

04:31:52.560 --> 04:31:55.560
He has since appeared in an interview with James Merritt, and it's fine enough,

04:31:55.560 --> 04:32:00.560
but I'd recommend watching it, although I do think he takes James' inexperience for a bit of a ride.

04:32:00.560 --> 04:32:05.560
The story about you, I know a lot of your content can be falsified, it can be real, you know,

04:32:05.560 --> 04:32:07.560
it's kind of like a mix, you never really know what you're gonna get.

04:32:07.560 --> 04:32:10.560
The video where you spoke about a heart attack, did that actually happen to you?

04:32:10.560 --> 04:32:12.560
It happened, yeah. Yes, it happened.

04:32:12.560 --> 04:32:17.560
Oh my god. Talk me through that. How was that? I mean, how was your heart attack?

04:32:17.560 --> 04:32:18.560
How tall are you?

04:32:18.560 --> 04:32:19.560
I'm 6 foot 4.

04:32:19.560 --> 04:32:20.560
Oh yeah, you're tall.

04:32:20.560 --> 04:32:22.560
Yeah, I'm quite tall.

04:32:22.560 --> 04:32:23.560
I'm 6 foot.

04:32:23.560 --> 04:32:25.560
You're taller than I thought you'd be as well, though.

04:32:25.560 --> 04:32:26.560
Yeah, I get that all the time.

04:32:26.560 --> 04:32:31.560
Though he does say at some point he may become a weight loss channel, which I guess I wouldn't put it past him.

04:32:31.560 --> 04:32:33.560
I look forward to that day.

04:32:33.560 --> 04:32:39.560
Nikocado is one of those people who I don't really hate, but who I also don't necessarily feel bad for either.

04:32:39.560 --> 04:32:44.560
Many of my friends find his content thoroughly amusing, and I think from a distance there is legitimate

04:32:44.560 --> 04:32:49.560
entertainment in what he makes, but it also appears that it's something that should be enjoyed from a distance,

04:32:49.560 --> 04:32:54.560
because when others have been caught up in the narrative, it seems that it can do more harm than good.

04:32:54.560 --> 04:32:59.560
Whether he's playing it up for dramatic effect or not, it's still involving real people, whose awareness

04:32:59.560 --> 04:33:03.560
of the content's nature ranges from possibly knowledgeable to completely ignorant.

04:33:03.560 --> 04:33:08.560
There's been a lot of speculation about his husband Allin's involvement, who has regularly been implicated

04:33:08.560 --> 04:33:12.560
in the drama, but has never really given people an indicative sign of his own knowledge.

04:33:12.560 --> 04:33:18.560
I'm not really in a position to pass such judgement, but if Allin isn't in on the act, then Nik has truly done some

04:33:18.560 --> 04:33:23.560
pretty rotten things, which are probably slightly less forgivable than what I've spoken about today.

04:33:23.560 --> 04:33:29.560
Nik's never been in the most placid communities, I'll concede that, and this video isn't an impassioned offense

04:33:29.560 --> 04:33:35.560
of everyone he's ever come into contact with, but Nik is like this twisted mirror which takes the community

04:33:35.560 --> 04:33:41.560
and reflects its most dramatic faces. Mr Avocado thrived on the toxicity, often indulging in it,

04:33:41.560 --> 04:33:46.560
and that's why many of these cliques will not remember him fondly at all. Whether that's how he'll be predominantly

04:33:46.560 --> 04:33:52.560
remembered on YouTube is another question, one for both him and the audience that will pass such judgement.

04:33:52.560 --> 04:33:59.560
This video isn't the end all of Nikocado Avocado content, those videos are unbelievable in length and discourse

04:33:59.560 --> 04:34:04.560
and therefore it's hard to completely condense all the details. There are other videos which also take perspectives

04:34:04.560 --> 04:34:09.560
which you're more than welcome to watch, and it's probably why this video has been a little longer than expected.

04:34:09.560 --> 04:34:13.560
If you're really that interested, then watch the videos for yourself, and make your own verdict.

04:34:13.560 --> 04:34:18.560
Regardless of mine, regardless of yours, we'll probably see more of this, this,

04:34:19.560 --> 04:34:24.560
and hopefully a little less of this.

04:34:24.560 --> 04:34:29.560
In the neverending nightmare of Nikocado Avocado.

04:34:29.560 --> 04:34:34.560
Shubidoo what? Am I doing it right, Nik? Am I doing it right?

04:34:36.560 --> 04:34:41.560
So yeah, that was the video, I hope you guys enjoyed, as you probably noticed it's quite a long video,

04:34:41.560 --> 04:34:47.560
but congratulations if you made it this far, I wanna give a big thanks to my editors, my many editors on this one,

04:34:47.560 --> 04:34:52.560
we've had a fair few, they're all up on screen now, go and check them out, send them some love, they do a fantastic job,

04:34:52.560 --> 04:34:58.560
and I really appreciate them. I wanna give a big thanks to the sponsor again for funding this video,

04:34:58.560 --> 04:35:04.560
being able to create such a lengthy, meaty piece gives me a bit more freedom and a bit more confidence

04:35:04.560 --> 04:35:09.560
when I create this stuff that YouTube isn't gonna ruin me, so I really appreciate that as well.

04:35:09.560 --> 04:35:14.560
And definitely go and check them out because I think it's a really good deal they've given me, 85% off Surfshark BPM,

04:35:14.560 --> 04:35:22.560
thank you guys again. A big thanks to the patrons, I need to give a big thanks to my $10 patreons who are up on screen now,

04:35:22.560 --> 04:35:32.560
doing a great job, I love you lots. $50 patrons, Amanda, Caroline, Devon, Hypercube, Rain, and Somehullerblue,

04:35:32.560 --> 04:35:41.560
thank you very much. And a big thanks to my $100 patrons, we have A Little Lass, Brandon Junk, Christopher Carrasse,

04:35:41.560 --> 04:35:50.560
Doddy, and Yesenia Ramirez and Candy Skulls, thank you so much for your support, I appreciate it a lot.

04:35:50.560 --> 04:35:55.560
I don't really have too much else to add, other than obviously you can find me on my socials though,

04:35:55.560 --> 04:36:01.560
I have been a bit more inactive recently due to being quite preoccupied with projects like this one,

04:36:01.560 --> 04:36:06.560
so I do my best to be around nonetheless, and I haven't been responding too much,

04:36:06.560 --> 04:36:12.560
though I must preface recently, and I do plan to correct that eventually, but I need to know my limits,

04:36:12.560 --> 04:36:16.560
and I'm currently at those limits, so thanks for watching regardless guys,

04:36:16.560 --> 04:36:20.560
and I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you in the next one.

04:36:36.560 --> 04:36:39.560
you
