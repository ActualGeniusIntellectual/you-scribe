1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,460
It's time to get rid of the horrible, racists, and sexists.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:13,460
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,240
too much free time, and heaven knows what is going on in the world these days.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,420
There are some very pressing matters.

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,880
Now we often speak about the importance of grave issues, such as language.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,960
We all know that there are some words that are a bit more unsavoury than others, however

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,200
there is still a colossal grey area.

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,800
But fortunately we have a lot of fantastic individuals to put us in our place when people-kind

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,800
goes astray.

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,200
Hello Justin Trudeau.

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,520
Now Justin Trudeau is a truly fascinating being, and one that becomes more entertaining

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,520
day after day.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,080
Apart from being known for his smouldering looks, he's also the Prime Minister of Canada

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,200
and leader of the Liberal Party.

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,200
He also likes to wear socks, so more power to him like that.

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,880
I'm not here to judge his electoral term, he seems to be one of those quote progressive

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,380
guys who make certain social issues at the media forefront, so I cannot assume the prosperity

18
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,960
of Canadians right now.

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,760
Maybe everyone's having a great time in Canada, and Trudeau's just bored so he's taken to

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,440
doing all this silly shit.

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,360
The hypothetical boredom may have been put on show at one of his latest talks, where

22
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,600
he decided to interrupt a person to correct their phrase from mankind to people-kind.

23
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,240
Now it would be dishonest to say that he didn't claim it was a joke.

24
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,200
Apparently there is context that was needed, but I just found it too funny to ignore, and

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,600
the fact that we've reached peak politics where we genuinely can't distinguish between

26
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,040
parody and reality.

27
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,840
And to be honest, when I first saw that clip, I thought to myself, parody has become reality.

28
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,720
Everyone hopped on it, one side to accuse him of mansplaining, another to bash him for

29
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,840
the sheer ridicule of such a statement, and even with the context it doesn't make too

30
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,840
much sense.

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,520
But, you know, who am I to judge?

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,720
I think the main problem with this joke is that it didn't appear to be a joke in many

33
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,480
people's logical functions.

34
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,480
Why is that?

35
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,400
Because if it was a joke, there was one of two outcomes, that he was taking a jab at

36
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,360
the questioner, or that he was taking a jab at the culture, now it was clear that he's

37
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,280
not one to take a jab at such a culture, it's not really up his street.

38
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,040
So with regards to the questioner, now, with enough thought, you can actually get a theory

39
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
of the joke.

40
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,320
So the concept of God is typically an androcentric concept, and therefore the questioner noted

41
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,440
that her church was challenging that concept, henceforth Trudeau was mimicking that style

42
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,440
by challenging the perceptibly androcentric use of the term mankind.

43
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,880
That was the humour.

44
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,480
But even with that said, the joke's not very clear, and it was said in a fairly straight

45
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,800
way, and it would still be out of character for someone like Trudeau.

46
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,120
But why isn't it clear?

47
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,200
Well, if we'd made a comment on this a few years ago, we'd all chuckle, great banter,

48
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,080
hahaha, life goes on.

49
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,120
There are a few reasons why it's not the same anymore.

50
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,240
Firstly, it was Justin Trudeau, who, as I said, is known for flaunting his progressive

51
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,640
credentials, but also the environment of internet paranoia, to say the least.

52
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,920
Not that that paranoia is wholly unjustified, recently it seems that many have attempted

53
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,040
to bastardise a few words that have had a foothold in language, so the atmosphere was

54
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,360
just brimming for someone like Trudeau to come and catalyse the tension.

55
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,600
There were two examples that stood out to me.

56
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,520
However, to speak about one, I've decided that my good man Jay Schlatt can come on and

57
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,800
talk about it, because he found it great banter, and I thought, you know what, let's get some

58
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
mates on.

59
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,880
This is a good ol' mates club right now.

60
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,320
Come on, Jay Schlatt, take him away, talk your shit.

61
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,440
Thank you so much for having me, and you know, it's truly an honour to be here, helping cover

62
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,480
some of society's most pressing issues.

63
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,560
There are some real problems going on nowadays, and I'm glad I'm able to-

64
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,920
Stop saying marijuana.

65
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
Why?

66
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,880
Because it's racist as f***.

67
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,640
This is what you brought me on to talk about?

68
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,640
Marijuana being racist?

69
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,040
Okay, remind me to never come back.

70
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,280
Stop saying marijuana is the newest installment of NowThis Weed, the pot-only chapter of NowThis.

71
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,120
Of course, NowThis being the news corporation that has a reputation for ruining things.

72
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,360
And today, this fine gentleman is here to drop some red pills on us.

73
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,400
The term was used to knock on people of colour and their devilish ways.

74
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,640
Now, the word itself isn't inherently racist.

75
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,680
The word itself isn't inherently racist, he says.

76
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,040
And in fact, he even suggests that the term marijuana came from Mexican immigrants, the

77
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,080
very same group of people he later claims the term demonizes.

78
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,760
He gives us a quick backstory next, explaining how the Federal Bureau of Narcotics started

79
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,240
a smear campaign against the drug in the 1930s, claiming that it led its non-white users to

80
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,480
commit violent crime.

81
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,920
Which is ridiculous, he says, because-

82
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,720
All I see people do when they smoke is sit on their couch, watch TV, eat munchies, and

83
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
fall asleep.

84
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,820
Imagine having the gall to crack a joke on a video about how the word marijuana is racist.

85
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,200
Not only that, but imagine only providing anecdotal evidence in your think piece.

86
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,160
Anyways, the origins of the word aren't racist, and the word already had a history completely

87
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,180
detached from the United States.

88
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,760
So all you're doing at this point is demanding we all stop saying an extremely popular word

89
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,220
because at some arbitrary point in time it was used by some people in an entirely different

90
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,880
culture than the one it originated in to make someone look bad.

91
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,880
You're actually insane.

92
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,160
You see, this is what I don't understand about the culture of word policing that's becoming

93
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,160
more and more prevalent.

94
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,080
At the end of the day, this fine gentleman, as well as everyone else who tries to tell

95
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,200
you what you can and cannot say, are coming from a good place, insofar as they're trying

96
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,740
to keep other people from being offended.

97
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,160
But prohibiting speech is the hilariously backwards approach to solving this problem.

98
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,600
Whenever this topic comes up, I always point back to a rare moment of sanity from iDubbbz

99
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,140
in his Tana Mongeau video.

100
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,440
This is a very important lesson in critical thinking.

101
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,400
Have you or your friends ever said a word so frequently that it's lost a lot of the

102
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,360
initial punch that it had, and eventually just lost all meaning entirely?

103
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,460
I remember initially hearing the word cunt and how awful that sounded, but I've used

104
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,640
it so frequently that it means fucking nothing to me now.

105
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:50,520
So all of you people out there who hold these words at such high esteem, you are giving

106
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,000
it the power that you so desperately want it to not have.

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,320
In attempts to control speech, you ensure that certain forbidden words will always have

108
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,320
power.

109
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,320
They'll always offend people.

110
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,560
It seems pretty counterproductive, considering you're only policing us in the interest of

111
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,540
protecting other people's feelings.

112
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,580
But not only are these people keeping certain words in this forbidden category, they're

113
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,060
adding new ones to it.

114
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,060
Marijuana!

115
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,060
Marijuana!

116
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,740
Put that next to all the other words that are insanely racist now.

117
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,740
You know what?

118
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,060
I want to see how far this rabbit hole can go.

119
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,660
Let's see how bland society gets once we're inevitably only allowed to pick from a list

120
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,700
of 20 different progressive-approved words.

121
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,740
I bet PeopleKind is on that list.

122
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,740
Thank you, JSlatt.

123
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,540
He is a devilishly underrated creator, so you should definitely check out his stuff

124
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,700
if you haven't already.

125
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,600
And JSlatt was just the appetizer to the main course, because it's one thing to complain

126
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,500
about the use of your own language, it's another to claim offense to the use of another that

127
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,100
you clearly demonstrate no understanding of.

128
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:53,060
So let's bring in this final example, because the marijuana situation is a molehill compared

129
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,060
to this mountain.

130
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,620
Now, in Twitter, there are some people who can be quite unpleasant, to be honest, and

131
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,580
that was demonstrated recently when a poor lady lost her dog.

132
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,580
The name of the dog?

133
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,580
Negro.

134
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,040
Now, negro is the Spanish word for black.

135
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,380
The dog was black, therefore, in spite of its simplicity, the name made sense.

136
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,100
However, some people were not having it, and being the slightly on-edge people that

137
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,820
they like to see themselves as, felt insulted that she had the audacity to name a dog such

138
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,140
an offensive word.

139
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,660
One Twitter even went as far to suggest that the fact that negro was the Spanish word for

140
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,980
black was racist as fuck.

141
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:27,100
Now, once again, we've reached a stage of international wokeness of oppression.

142
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,020
The fact that a traditional word that predates the forms of suffering that many reference

143
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:36,220
to these days is somehow a contentious issue that needs to be discussed as racism, with

144
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,920
no link whatsoever, just bewilders me.

145
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,140
The sheer usage of such objective words to take offence to.

146
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,220
Is anyone really victimised by this?

147
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,180
Or is it just another crazy, crazy Twitter moment?

148
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,800
I think, personally, you know, this is just my hot take, I guess.

149
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
It's the latter.

150
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
But this is the thing.

151
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,780
You have a few irrational beings who threw a tantrum, it's covered in various news articles,

152
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,340
and it creates this atmosphere of uncertainty that people are gonna live in the word police

153
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,340
state.

154
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,340
I do not believe it myself.

155
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,420
Unless some are gonna start growing up and realise that words exist, some words that

156
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:14,940
have bad roots, some that may even correlate with negative things of another language,

157
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,540
heaven forbid, people are just gonna have to get used to it.

158
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:23,580
Unless you want to live in a padded cell, you have to live with these words.

159
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,100
And if we're gonna start talking about objects like colours, or drugs like marijuana, then

160
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,440
you're gonna have to get used to it and stop wasting people's time.

161
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,040
The Trudeau reaction, whether it was a joke or not, it was an insight to what people these

162
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,760
days expect.

163
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,760
Overreaction?

164
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,760
Maybe.

165
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,360
The internet definitely needs to cool off.

166
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,840
I think we all need to cool off.

167
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,920
But let's create an atmosphere where we can cool off, eh?

168
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
Good.

169
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,680
Anyway, I would love to hear your thoughts down below.

170
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,160
Should we deal with that dog, that cheeky cunt, or should we leave the joyous canine

171
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,160
alone?

172
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,000
Thankfully, he's back home now.

173
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,920
Until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

174
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
Bye!

175
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
Bye!

176
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:03,940
Bye!
