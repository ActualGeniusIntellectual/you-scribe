0	4460	It's time to get rid of the horrible, racists, and sexists.
4460	13460	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
13460	17240	too much free time, and heaven knows what is going on in the world these days.
17240	19420	There are some very pressing matters.
19420	22880	Now we often speak about the importance of grave issues, such as language.
22880	25960	We all know that there are some words that are a bit more unsavoury than others, however
25960	28200	there is still a colossal grey area.
28200	32800	But fortunately we have a lot of fantastic individuals to put us in our place when people-kind
32800	33800	goes astray.
33800	35200	Hello Justin Trudeau.
35200	40520	Now Justin Trudeau is a truly fascinating being, and one that becomes more entertaining
40520	41520	day after day.
41520	45080	Apart from being known for his smouldering looks, he's also the Prime Minister of Canada
45080	47200	and leader of the Liberal Party.
47200	51200	He also likes to wear socks, so more power to him like that.
51200	54880	I'm not here to judge his electoral term, he seems to be one of those quote progressive
54880	60380	guys who make certain social issues at the media forefront, so I cannot assume the prosperity
60380	61960	of Canadians right now.
61960	65760	Maybe everyone's having a great time in Canada, and Trudeau's just bored so he's taken to
65760	67440	doing all this silly shit.
67440	71360	The hypothetical boredom may have been put on show at one of his latest talks, where
71360	75600	he decided to interrupt a person to correct their phrase from mankind to people-kind.
75600	79240	Now it would be dishonest to say that he didn't claim it was a joke.
79240	83200	Apparently there is context that was needed, but I just found it too funny to ignore, and
83200	86600	the fact that we've reached peak politics where we genuinely can't distinguish between
86600	88040	parody and reality.
88040	92840	And to be honest, when I first saw that clip, I thought to myself, parody has become reality.
92840	96720	Everyone hopped on it, one side to accuse him of mansplaining, another to bash him for
96720	100840	the sheer ridicule of such a statement, and even with the context it doesn't make too
100840	101840	much sense.
101840	103520	But, you know, who am I to judge?
103520	107720	I think the main problem with this joke is that it didn't appear to be a joke in many
107720	109480	people's logical functions.
109480	110480	Why is that?
110480	113400	Because if it was a joke, there was one of two outcomes, that he was taking a jab at
113400	116360	the questioner, or that he was taking a jab at the culture, now it was clear that he's
116360	120280	not one to take a jab at such a culture, it's not really up his street.
120280	124040	So with regards to the questioner, now, with enough thought, you can actually get a theory
124040	125040	of the joke.
125040	129320	So the concept of God is typically an androcentric concept, and therefore the questioner noted
129320	133440	that her church was challenging that concept, henceforth Trudeau was mimicking that style
133440	137440	by challenging the perceptibly androcentric use of the term mankind.
137440	138880	That was the humour.
138880	142480	But even with that said, the joke's not very clear, and it was said in a fairly straight
142480	145800	way, and it would still be out of character for someone like Trudeau.
145800	147120	But why isn't it clear?
147120	151200	Well, if we'd made a comment on this a few years ago, we'd all chuckle, great banter,
151200	153080	hahaha, life goes on.
153080	155120	There are a few reasons why it's not the same anymore.
155120	159240	Firstly, it was Justin Trudeau, who, as I said, is known for flaunting his progressive
159240	163640	credentials, but also the environment of internet paranoia, to say the least.
163640	167920	Not that that paranoia is wholly unjustified, recently it seems that many have attempted
167920	172040	to bastardise a few words that have had a foothold in language, so the atmosphere was
172040	175360	just brimming for someone like Trudeau to come and catalyse the tension.
175360	177600	There were two examples that stood out to me.
177600	181520	However, to speak about one, I've decided that my good man Jay Schlatt can come on and
181520	185800	talk about it, because he found it great banter, and I thought, you know what, let's get some
185800	186800	mates on.
186800	188880	This is a good ol' mates club right now.
188880	191320	Come on, Jay Schlatt, take him away, talk your shit.
191320	194440	Thank you so much for having me, and you know, it's truly an honour to be here, helping cover
194440	196480	some of society's most pressing issues.
196520	199560	There are some real problems going on nowadays, and I'm glad I'm able to-
199560	201920	Stop saying marijuana.
201920	202920	Why?
202920	204880	Because it's racist as f***.
207280	209640	This is what you brought me on to talk about?
209640	210640	Marijuana being racist?
210640	213040	Okay, remind me to never come back.
213040	218280	Stop saying marijuana is the newest installment of NowThis Weed, the pot-only chapter of NowThis.
218280	222120	Of course, NowThis being the news corporation that has a reputation for ruining things.
222120	225360	And today, this fine gentleman is here to drop some red pills on us.
225360	229400	The term was used to knock on people of colour and their devilish ways.
229400	232640	Now, the word itself isn't inherently racist.
232640	235680	The word itself isn't inherently racist, he says.
235680	240040	And in fact, he even suggests that the term marijuana came from Mexican immigrants, the
240040	243080	very same group of people he later claims the term demonizes.
243080	246760	He gives us a quick backstory next, explaining how the Federal Bureau of Narcotics started
246760	251240	a smear campaign against the drug in the 1930s, claiming that it led its non-white users to
251240	252480	commit violent crime.
252480	254920	Which is ridiculous, he says, because-
254920	260720	All I see people do when they smoke is sit on their couch, watch TV, eat munchies, and
260720	261720	fall asleep.
261720	266820	Imagine having the gall to crack a joke on a video about how the word marijuana is racist.
266820	271200	Not only that, but imagine only providing anecdotal evidence in your think piece.
271200	276160	Anyways, the origins of the word aren't racist, and the word already had a history completely
276160	278180	detached from the United States.
278180	282760	So all you're doing at this point is demanding we all stop saying an extremely popular word
282760	287220	because at some arbitrary point in time it was used by some people in an entirely different
287220	290880	culture than the one it originated in to make someone look bad.
290880	291880	You're actually insane.
291880	296160	You see, this is what I don't understand about the culture of word policing that's becoming
296160	297160	more and more prevalent.
297160	300080	At the end of the day, this fine gentleman, as well as everyone else who tries to tell
300080	305200	you what you can and cannot say, are coming from a good place, insofar as they're trying
305200	307740	to keep other people from being offended.
307740	312160	But prohibiting speech is the hilariously backwards approach to solving this problem.
312280	316600	Whenever this topic comes up, I always point back to a rare moment of sanity from iDubbbz
316600	318140	in his Tana Mongeau video.
318140	321440	This is a very important lesson in critical thinking.
321440	326400	Have you or your friends ever said a word so frequently that it's lost a lot of the
326400	331360	initial punch that it had, and eventually just lost all meaning entirely?
331360	336460	I remember initially hearing the word cunt and how awful that sounded, but I've used
336460	340640	it so frequently that it means fucking nothing to me now.
341640	350520	So all of you people out there who hold these words at such high esteem, you are giving
350520	355000	it the power that you so desperately want it to not have.
355000	360320	In attempts to control speech, you ensure that certain forbidden words will always have
360320	361320	power.
361320	362320	They'll always offend people.
362320	366560	It seems pretty counterproductive, considering you're only policing us in the interest of
366560	368540	protecting other people's feelings.
368540	372580	But not only are these people keeping certain words in this forbidden category, they're
372580	374060	adding new ones to it.
374060	375060	Marijuana!
375060	376060	Marijuana!
376060	378740	Put that next to all the other words that are insanely racist now.
378740	379740	You know what?
379740	381060	I want to see how far this rabbit hole can go.
381060	384660	Let's see how bland society gets once we're inevitably only allowed to pick from a list
384660	387700	of 20 different progressive-approved words.
387700	391740	I bet PeopleKind is on that list.
391740	392740	Thank you, JSlatt.
392740	396540	He is a devilishly underrated creator, so you should definitely check out his stuff
396540	397700	if you haven't already.
397700	401600	And JSlatt was just the appetizer to the main course, because it's one thing to complain
401600	405500	about the use of your own language, it's another to claim offense to the use of another that
405500	408100	you clearly demonstrate no understanding of.
408100	413060	So let's bring in this final example, because the marijuana situation is a molehill compared
413060	414060	to this mountain.
414060	417620	Now, in Twitter, there are some people who can be quite unpleasant, to be honest, and
417620	420580	that was demonstrated recently when a poor lady lost her dog.
420580	421580	The name of the dog?
421580	422580	Negro.
422580	424040	Now, negro is the Spanish word for black.
424040	427380	The dog was black, therefore, in spite of its simplicity, the name made sense.
427380	431100	However, some people were not having it, and being the slightly on-edge people that
431100	435820	they like to see themselves as, felt insulted that she had the audacity to name a dog such
435820	437140	an offensive word.
437140	440660	One Twitter even went as far to suggest that the fact that negro was the Spanish word for
440660	442980	black was racist as fuck.
442980	447100	Now, once again, we've reached a stage of international wokeness of oppression.
447100	451020	The fact that a traditional word that predates the forms of suffering that many reference
451020	456220	to these days is somehow a contentious issue that needs to be discussed as racism, with
456220	458920	no link whatsoever, just bewilders me.
458920	463140	The sheer usage of such objective words to take offence to.
463140	466220	Is anyone really victimised by this?
466220	469180	Or is it just another crazy, crazy Twitter moment?
469180	472800	I think, personally, you know, this is just my hot take, I guess.
472800	473800	It's the latter.
473800	474800	But this is the thing.
474800	478780	You have a few irrational beings who threw a tantrum, it's covered in various news articles,
478780	483340	and it creates this atmosphere of uncertainty that people are gonna live in the word police
483340	484340	state.
484340	485340	I do not believe it myself.
485500	489420	Unless some are gonna start growing up and realise that words exist, some words that
489420	494940	have bad roots, some that may even correlate with negative things of another language,
494940	498540	heaven forbid, people are just gonna have to get used to it.
498540	503580	Unless you want to live in a padded cell, you have to live with these words.
503580	508100	And if we're gonna start talking about objects like colours, or drugs like marijuana, then
508100	511440	you're gonna have to get used to it and stop wasting people's time.
511440	516040	The Trudeau reaction, whether it was a joke or not, it was an insight to what people these
516040	517760	days expect.
517760	518760	Overreaction?
518760	519760	Maybe.
519760	521360	The internet definitely needs to cool off.
521360	522840	I think we all need to cool off.
522840	525920	But let's create an atmosphere where we can cool off, eh?
525920	526920	Good.
526920	528680	Anyway, I would love to hear your thoughts down below.
528680	533160	Should we deal with that dog, that cheeky cunt, or should we leave the joyous canine
533160	534160	alone?
534160	536000	Thankfully, he's back home now.
536000	538920	Until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
541440	542440	Bye!
542440	543440	Bye!
543440	543940	Bye!
