00:00.000 --> 00:04.460
It's time to get rid of the horrible, racists, and sexists.

00:04.460 --> 00:13.460
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:13.460 --> 00:17.240
too much free time, and heaven knows what is going on in the world these days.

00:17.240 --> 00:19.420
There are some very pressing matters.

00:19.420 --> 00:22.880
Now we often speak about the importance of grave issues, such as language.

00:22.880 --> 00:25.960
We all know that there are some words that are a bit more unsavoury than others, however

00:25.960 --> 00:28.200
there is still a colossal grey area.

00:28.200 --> 00:32.800
But fortunately we have a lot of fantastic individuals to put us in our place when people-kind

00:32.800 --> 00:33.800
goes astray.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.200
Hello Justin Trudeau.

00:35.200 --> 00:40.520
Now Justin Trudeau is a truly fascinating being, and one that becomes more entertaining

00:40.520 --> 00:41.520
day after day.

00:41.520 --> 00:45.080
Apart from being known for his smouldering looks, he's also the Prime Minister of Canada

00:45.080 --> 00:47.200
and leader of the Liberal Party.

00:47.200 --> 00:51.200
He also likes to wear socks, so more power to him like that.

00:51.200 --> 00:54.880
I'm not here to judge his electoral term, he seems to be one of those quote progressive

00:54.880 --> 01:00.380
guys who make certain social issues at the media forefront, so I cannot assume the prosperity

01:00.380 --> 01:01.960
of Canadians right now.

01:01.960 --> 01:05.760
Maybe everyone's having a great time in Canada, and Trudeau's just bored so he's taken to

01:05.760 --> 01:07.440
doing all this silly shit.

01:07.440 --> 01:11.360
The hypothetical boredom may have been put on show at one of his latest talks, where

01:11.360 --> 01:15.600
he decided to interrupt a person to correct their phrase from mankind to people-kind.

01:15.600 --> 01:19.240
Now it would be dishonest to say that he didn't claim it was a joke.

01:19.240 --> 01:23.200
Apparently there is context that was needed, but I just found it too funny to ignore, and

01:23.200 --> 01:26.600
the fact that we've reached peak politics where we genuinely can't distinguish between

01:26.600 --> 01:28.040
parody and reality.

01:28.040 --> 01:32.840
And to be honest, when I first saw that clip, I thought to myself, parody has become reality.

01:32.840 --> 01:36.720
Everyone hopped on it, one side to accuse him of mansplaining, another to bash him for

01:36.720 --> 01:40.840
the sheer ridicule of such a statement, and even with the context it doesn't make too

01:40.840 --> 01:41.840
much sense.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.520
But, you know, who am I to judge?

01:43.520 --> 01:47.720
I think the main problem with this joke is that it didn't appear to be a joke in many

01:47.720 --> 01:49.480
people's logical functions.

01:49.480 --> 01:50.480
Why is that?

01:50.480 --> 01:53.400
Because if it was a joke, there was one of two outcomes, that he was taking a jab at

01:53.400 --> 01:56.360
the questioner, or that he was taking a jab at the culture, now it was clear that he's

01:56.360 --> 02:00.280
not one to take a jab at such a culture, it's not really up his street.

02:00.280 --> 02:04.040
So with regards to the questioner, now, with enough thought, you can actually get a theory

02:04.040 --> 02:05.040
of the joke.

02:05.040 --> 02:09.320
So the concept of God is typically an androcentric concept, and therefore the questioner noted

02:09.320 --> 02:13.440
that her church was challenging that concept, henceforth Trudeau was mimicking that style

02:13.440 --> 02:17.440
by challenging the perceptibly androcentric use of the term mankind.

02:17.440 --> 02:18.880
That was the humour.

02:18.880 --> 02:22.480
But even with that said, the joke's not very clear, and it was said in a fairly straight

02:22.480 --> 02:25.800
way, and it would still be out of character for someone like Trudeau.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.120
But why isn't it clear?

02:27.120 --> 02:31.200
Well, if we'd made a comment on this a few years ago, we'd all chuckle, great banter,

02:31.200 --> 02:33.080
hahaha, life goes on.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.120
There are a few reasons why it's not the same anymore.

02:35.120 --> 02:39.240
Firstly, it was Justin Trudeau, who, as I said, is known for flaunting his progressive

02:39.240 --> 02:43.640
credentials, but also the environment of internet paranoia, to say the least.

02:43.640 --> 02:47.920
Not that that paranoia is wholly unjustified, recently it seems that many have attempted

02:47.920 --> 02:52.040
to bastardise a few words that have had a foothold in language, so the atmosphere was

02:52.040 --> 02:55.360
just brimming for someone like Trudeau to come and catalyse the tension.

02:55.360 --> 02:57.600
There were two examples that stood out to me.

02:57.600 --> 03:01.520
However, to speak about one, I've decided that my good man Jay Schlatt can come on and

03:01.520 --> 03:05.800
talk about it, because he found it great banter, and I thought, you know what, let's get some

03:05.800 --> 03:06.800
mates on.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.880
This is a good ol' mates club right now.

03:08.880 --> 03:11.320
Come on, Jay Schlatt, take him away, talk your shit.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.440
Thank you so much for having me, and you know, it's truly an honour to be here, helping cover

03:14.440 --> 03:16.480
some of society's most pressing issues.

03:16.520 --> 03:19.560
There are some real problems going on nowadays, and I'm glad I'm able to-

03:19.560 --> 03:21.920
Stop saying marijuana.

03:21.920 --> 03:22.920
Why?

03:22.920 --> 03:24.880
Because it's racist as f***.

03:27.280 --> 03:29.640
This is what you brought me on to talk about?

03:29.640 --> 03:30.640
Marijuana being racist?

03:30.640 --> 03:33.040
Okay, remind me to never come back.

03:33.040 --> 03:38.280
Stop saying marijuana is the newest installment of NowThis Weed, the pot-only chapter of NowThis.

03:38.280 --> 03:42.120
Of course, NowThis being the news corporation that has a reputation for ruining things.

03:42.120 --> 03:45.360
And today, this fine gentleman is here to drop some red pills on us.

03:45.360 --> 03:49.400
The term was used to knock on people of colour and their devilish ways.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.640
Now, the word itself isn't inherently racist.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.680
The word itself isn't inherently racist, he says.

03:55.680 --> 04:00.040
And in fact, he even suggests that the term marijuana came from Mexican immigrants, the

04:00.040 --> 04:03.080
very same group of people he later claims the term demonizes.

04:03.080 --> 04:06.760
He gives us a quick backstory next, explaining how the Federal Bureau of Narcotics started

04:06.760 --> 04:11.240
a smear campaign against the drug in the 1930s, claiming that it led its non-white users to

04:11.240 --> 04:12.480
commit violent crime.

04:12.480 --> 04:14.920
Which is ridiculous, he says, because-

04:14.920 --> 04:20.720
All I see people do when they smoke is sit on their couch, watch TV, eat munchies, and

04:20.720 --> 04:21.720
fall asleep.

04:21.720 --> 04:26.820
Imagine having the gall to crack a joke on a video about how the word marijuana is racist.

04:26.820 --> 04:31.200
Not only that, but imagine only providing anecdotal evidence in your think piece.

04:31.200 --> 04:36.160
Anyways, the origins of the word aren't racist, and the word already had a history completely

04:36.160 --> 04:38.180
detached from the United States.

04:38.180 --> 04:42.760
So all you're doing at this point is demanding we all stop saying an extremely popular word

04:42.760 --> 04:47.220
because at some arbitrary point in time it was used by some people in an entirely different

04:47.220 --> 04:50.880
culture than the one it originated in to make someone look bad.

04:50.880 --> 04:51.880
You're actually insane.

04:51.880 --> 04:56.160
You see, this is what I don't understand about the culture of word policing that's becoming

04:56.160 --> 04:57.160
more and more prevalent.

04:57.160 --> 05:00.080
At the end of the day, this fine gentleman, as well as everyone else who tries to tell

05:00.080 --> 05:05.200
you what you can and cannot say, are coming from a good place, insofar as they're trying

05:05.200 --> 05:07.740
to keep other people from being offended.

05:07.740 --> 05:12.160
But prohibiting speech is the hilariously backwards approach to solving this problem.

05:12.280 --> 05:16.600
Whenever this topic comes up, I always point back to a rare moment of sanity from iDubbbz

05:16.600 --> 05:18.140
in his Tana Mongeau video.

05:18.140 --> 05:21.440
This is a very important lesson in critical thinking.

05:21.440 --> 05:26.400
Have you or your friends ever said a word so frequently that it's lost a lot of the

05:26.400 --> 05:31.360
initial punch that it had, and eventually just lost all meaning entirely?

05:31.360 --> 05:36.460
I remember initially hearing the word cunt and how awful that sounded, but I've used

05:36.460 --> 05:40.640
it so frequently that it means fucking nothing to me now.

05:41.640 --> 05:50.520
So all of you people out there who hold these words at such high esteem, you are giving

05:50.520 --> 05:55.000
it the power that you so desperately want it to not have.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.320
In attempts to control speech, you ensure that certain forbidden words will always have

06:00.320 --> 06:01.320
power.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.320
They'll always offend people.

06:02.320 --> 06:06.560
It seems pretty counterproductive, considering you're only policing us in the interest of

06:06.560 --> 06:08.540
protecting other people's feelings.

06:08.540 --> 06:12.580
But not only are these people keeping certain words in this forbidden category, they're

06:12.580 --> 06:14.060
adding new ones to it.

06:14.060 --> 06:15.060
Marijuana!

06:15.060 --> 06:16.060
Marijuana!

06:16.060 --> 06:18.740
Put that next to all the other words that are insanely racist now.

06:18.740 --> 06:19.740
You know what?

06:19.740 --> 06:21.060
I want to see how far this rabbit hole can go.

06:21.060 --> 06:24.660
Let's see how bland society gets once we're inevitably only allowed to pick from a list

06:24.660 --> 06:27.700
of 20 different progressive-approved words.

06:27.700 --> 06:31.740
I bet PeopleKind is on that list.

06:31.740 --> 06:32.740
Thank you, JSlatt.

06:32.740 --> 06:36.540
He is a devilishly underrated creator, so you should definitely check out his stuff

06:36.540 --> 06:37.700
if you haven't already.

06:37.700 --> 06:41.600
And JSlatt was just the appetizer to the main course, because it's one thing to complain

06:41.600 --> 06:45.500
about the use of your own language, it's another to claim offense to the use of another that

06:45.500 --> 06:48.100
you clearly demonstrate no understanding of.

06:48.100 --> 06:53.060
So let's bring in this final example, because the marijuana situation is a molehill compared

06:53.060 --> 06:54.060
to this mountain.

06:54.060 --> 06:57.620
Now, in Twitter, there are some people who can be quite unpleasant, to be honest, and

06:57.620 --> 07:00.580
that was demonstrated recently when a poor lady lost her dog.

07:00.580 --> 07:01.580
The name of the dog?

07:01.580 --> 07:02.580
Negro.

07:02.580 --> 07:04.040
Now, negro is the Spanish word for black.

07:04.040 --> 07:07.380
The dog was black, therefore, in spite of its simplicity, the name made sense.

07:07.380 --> 07:11.100
However, some people were not having it, and being the slightly on-edge people that

07:11.100 --> 07:15.820
they like to see themselves as, felt insulted that she had the audacity to name a dog such

07:15.820 --> 07:17.140
an offensive word.

07:17.140 --> 07:20.660
One Twitter even went as far to suggest that the fact that negro was the Spanish word for

07:20.660 --> 07:22.980
black was racist as fuck.

07:22.980 --> 07:27.100
Now, once again, we've reached a stage of international wokeness of oppression.

07:27.100 --> 07:31.020
The fact that a traditional word that predates the forms of suffering that many reference

07:31.020 --> 07:36.220
to these days is somehow a contentious issue that needs to be discussed as racism, with

07:36.220 --> 07:38.920
no link whatsoever, just bewilders me.

07:38.920 --> 07:43.140
The sheer usage of such objective words to take offence to.

07:43.140 --> 07:46.220
Is anyone really victimised by this?

07:46.220 --> 07:49.180
Or is it just another crazy, crazy Twitter moment?

07:49.180 --> 07:52.800
I think, personally, you know, this is just my hot take, I guess.

07:52.800 --> 07:53.800
It's the latter.

07:53.800 --> 07:54.800
But this is the thing.

07:54.800 --> 07:58.780
You have a few irrational beings who threw a tantrum, it's covered in various news articles,

07:58.780 --> 08:03.340
and it creates this atmosphere of uncertainty that people are gonna live in the word police

08:03.340 --> 08:04.340
state.

08:04.340 --> 08:05.340
I do not believe it myself.

08:05.500 --> 08:09.420
Unless some are gonna start growing up and realise that words exist, some words that

08:09.420 --> 08:14.940
have bad roots, some that may even correlate with negative things of another language,

08:14.940 --> 08:18.540
heaven forbid, people are just gonna have to get used to it.

08:18.540 --> 08:23.580
Unless you want to live in a padded cell, you have to live with these words.

08:23.580 --> 08:28.100
And if we're gonna start talking about objects like colours, or drugs like marijuana, then

08:28.100 --> 08:31.440
you're gonna have to get used to it and stop wasting people's time.

08:31.440 --> 08:36.040
The Trudeau reaction, whether it was a joke or not, it was an insight to what people these

08:36.040 --> 08:37.760
days expect.

08:37.760 --> 08:38.760
Overreaction?

08:38.760 --> 08:39.760
Maybe.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.360
The internet definitely needs to cool off.

08:41.360 --> 08:42.840
I think we all need to cool off.

08:42.840 --> 08:45.920
But let's create an atmosphere where we can cool off, eh?

08:45.920 --> 08:46.920
Good.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.680
Anyway, I would love to hear your thoughts down below.

08:48.680 --> 08:53.160
Should we deal with that dog, that cheeky cunt, or should we leave the joyous canine

08:53.160 --> 08:54.160
alone?

08:54.160 --> 08:56.000
Thankfully, he's back home now.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.920
Until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

09:01.440 --> 09:02.440
Bye!

09:02.440 --> 09:03.440
Bye!

09:03.440 --> 09:03.940
Bye!
