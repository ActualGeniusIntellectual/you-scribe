00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
A little thought piece here.

00:02.000 --> 00:09.660
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:09.660 --> 00:10.760
too much free time.

00:10.760 --> 00:14.600
And I enjoy trading, I recently got into the habit of day trading, where you put some money

00:14.600 --> 00:18.140
in, let it go somewhere and take it out, with the premise that hopefully you've made a bit

00:18.140 --> 00:19.140
of dollar here and there.

00:19.140 --> 00:22.640
One of my favourites for day trading are the cryptocurrencies, their volatility allows

00:22.640 --> 00:24.240
you to make money fairly easily.

00:24.240 --> 00:28.440
Day trading for me is a nice pastime, however as I learned recently when I fell asleep with

00:28.440 --> 00:31.400
money in the game, it's best to do it when you have a bit more free time.

00:31.400 --> 00:35.560
At the forefront of cryptocurrencies is Bitcoin, one that I've actually avoided.

00:35.560 --> 00:37.920
Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to appear.

00:37.920 --> 00:41.700
The basic premise of cryptocurrencies is that they're not owned by a single government and

00:41.700 --> 00:44.680
it doesn't experience taxation or inflation by effect.

00:44.680 --> 00:49.320
It is handled by an online blockchain which to sum up is where a record of these transactions

00:49.320 --> 00:50.320
are stored.

00:50.320 --> 00:54.040
One of the very unique traits of cryptocurrency is that it's very difficult to commit fraud

00:54.040 --> 00:59.080
as the online blockchain means that the cryptocurrency can be tied down to a specific consumer, so

00:59.080 --> 01:02.160
that consumer does truly own the Bitcoin they have.

01:02.160 --> 01:05.500
Now there are many more specific details that if I were to include, would probably confuse

01:05.500 --> 01:07.360
you more than it has already confused me.

01:07.360 --> 01:11.440
Now as I said, at the centre of cryptocurrencies is Bitcoin, which has caused a lot of excitement

01:11.440 --> 01:15.480
recently due to its inflating value, with many investors funding it with the faith that

01:15.480 --> 01:17.040
it will continue to increase.

01:17.040 --> 01:20.440
To put it into perspective, whereas 6 years ago, one bitcoin would have approximately

01:20.440 --> 01:25.000
been worth $1, it is at the time of writing this, worth over $18,000.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.400
Now it may be a bit less when this video is released because it is that changeable, but

01:28.400 --> 01:32.000
it clearly demonstrates how much this has exploded in the last few years.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.240
If you look at the graph, you'll notice that it has increased at an unbelievably exponential

01:36.240 --> 01:37.240
rate.

01:37.240 --> 01:40.800
But as the old adage goes, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.

01:40.800 --> 01:44.120
And with this, many are beginning to wonder whether it's a bubble waiting to burst.

01:44.120 --> 01:48.840
One of those people was the wolf on Wall Street himself, Jordan Belfort, whose autobiographical

01:48.840 --> 01:52.360
fall from grace was the source material for the Martin Scorsese feature film.

01:52.360 --> 01:56.760
In an interview with CNN, he claimed that the cryptocurrency was quote unquote a big

01:56.760 --> 02:00.000
scam and projected the value of bitcoin would plummet greatly.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.920
Belfort outlines a very interesting theory that is more relevant to cryptocurrencies

02:03.920 --> 02:07.020
than almost any other market, the hype victim theory.

02:07.020 --> 02:10.640
Now that can happen in any industry where something is hyped up and therefore its value

02:10.640 --> 02:15.280
increases, however eventually there is this revelation of the illusion and it collapses.

02:15.280 --> 02:19.320
However with bitcoin and any other currency, the hype is a snowball effect because people

02:19.320 --> 02:22.960
buy into it and therefore encourage the notion that it is increasing in value.

02:22.960 --> 02:26.840
This is particularly noticeable when you look at the buyer seller ratio, if that ratio was

02:26.840 --> 02:30.080
applied to many other stocks, they would be shooting through the roof.

02:30.080 --> 02:34.240
Which is why cryptocurrencies do have their moments of crashing very severely because

02:34.240 --> 02:38.520
something conducting a sell of a large volume could trigger the misconception the whole

02:38.520 --> 02:40.120
currency is collapsing.

02:40.120 --> 02:44.080
That's less prominent with bitcoin as it's a slightly more stable crypto than its competitors,

02:44.080 --> 02:48.840
but there's no doubt that a lot of bitcoin's current success is a result of its own hype.

02:48.840 --> 02:52.640
What Belfort is suggesting is that there are a select few who are looking to make a lot

02:52.640 --> 02:57.600
of money publicising and emphasising success through various techniques, which in effect

02:57.600 --> 02:59.760
builds up hype and increases investment.

02:59.760 --> 03:03.480
That investment leads to further hype, media articles about how bitcoin is skyrocketing

03:03.480 --> 03:07.880
for example, at which point you enter a hype investment cycle, until someone breaks that

03:07.880 --> 03:11.300
cycle and bitcoin's true value is seen for what it is.

03:11.300 --> 03:13.320
Is Belfort a trustworthy source though?

03:13.320 --> 03:17.540
Maybe, as noted in the article, he has his fair experience with shares and scams.

03:17.540 --> 03:21.680
Now obviously there are differences between Belfort's example and bitcoin, but Belfort

03:21.680 --> 03:25.160
is right that there are a lot of self-centred people who probably see this as an opportunity

03:25.160 --> 03:26.240
to make a lot of money.

03:26.240 --> 03:30.000
With that said, how much influence they're having and whether that influences altering

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
bitcoin's value at all is another question, and one that we can't necessarily answer.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.540
Essentially it's a no until the answer's yes.

03:37.540 --> 03:41.460
Now we're not comparing bitcoin to Belfort beyond conceptual knowledge, in that instance

03:41.460 --> 03:45.620
the scams landed him in prison, if bitcoin crashed tomorrow would anyone who manipulated

03:45.620 --> 03:47.500
it by publicising it go to prison?

03:47.500 --> 03:48.500
Unlikely.

03:48.500 --> 03:51.980
You can't really depict people's motivations for over-hyping something, and this isn't

03:51.980 --> 03:56.660
an example of defrauding on Belfort's scale, it's not accountable to one person.

03:56.660 --> 03:58.940
Bitcoin doesn't work like that.

03:58.940 --> 03:59.940
What does this mean?

03:59.940 --> 04:04.560
If bitcoin is a scam whose stocks have been manipulated by profit-driven individuals,

04:04.560 --> 04:08.360
it will only be realised too late, there will be losers, there always are.

04:08.360 --> 04:12.200
We also cannot tell when the manipulation started and how badly the effect will truly

04:12.200 --> 04:13.360
be due to that.

04:13.360 --> 04:17.840
We've reached a very unique situation where bitcoin is being valued more as an investment

04:17.840 --> 04:20.280
product than what it originally represented.

04:20.280 --> 04:24.200
That clouds the judgement of its true value and therefore makes it incredibly difficult

04:24.200 --> 04:27.720
to decipher how such a claim like Belfort's would be addressed.

04:27.720 --> 04:29.940
What lies in the future for bitcoin then?

04:29.940 --> 04:34.800
We can be certain that it will peak, but its response after is what will decide its future

04:34.800 --> 04:37.080
of many, many investors.

04:37.080 --> 04:40.740
I'd like to thank Michael Voll and Lord Seago for proofreading my script, because

04:40.740 --> 04:44.720
I didn't want to get any of the details wrong, and I want to thank them for verifying

04:44.720 --> 04:47.800
it, and I would love to hear what your thoughts are as well.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.080
Are there any investors out there?

04:49.080 --> 04:52.600
I would be more than delighted to hear your input below.

04:52.600 --> 04:55.560
Until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

05:07.080 --> 05:18.960
Peace.
