0	2000	A little thought piece here.
2000	9660	Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
9660	10760	too much free time.
10760	14600	And I enjoy trading, I recently got into the habit of day trading, where you put some money
14600	18140	in, let it go somewhere and take it out, with the premise that hopefully you've made a bit
18140	19140	of dollar here and there.
19140	22640	One of my favourites for day trading are the cryptocurrencies, their volatility allows
22640	24240	you to make money fairly easily.
24240	28440	Day trading for me is a nice pastime, however as I learned recently when I fell asleep with
28440	31400	money in the game, it's best to do it when you have a bit more free time.
31400	35560	At the forefront of cryptocurrencies is Bitcoin, one that I've actually avoided.
35560	37920	Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to appear.
37920	41700	The basic premise of cryptocurrencies is that they're not owned by a single government and
41700	44680	it doesn't experience taxation or inflation by effect.
44680	49320	It is handled by an online blockchain which to sum up is where a record of these transactions
49320	50320	are stored.
50320	54040	One of the very unique traits of cryptocurrency is that it's very difficult to commit fraud
54040	59080	as the online blockchain means that the cryptocurrency can be tied down to a specific consumer, so
59080	62160	that consumer does truly own the Bitcoin they have.
62160	65500	Now there are many more specific details that if I were to include, would probably confuse
65500	67360	you more than it has already confused me.
67360	71440	Now as I said, at the centre of cryptocurrencies is Bitcoin, which has caused a lot of excitement
71440	75480	recently due to its inflating value, with many investors funding it with the faith that
75480	77040	it will continue to increase.
77040	80440	To put it into perspective, whereas 6 years ago, one bitcoin would have approximately
80440	85000	been worth $1, it is at the time of writing this, worth over $18,000.
85000	88400	Now it may be a bit less when this video is released because it is that changeable, but
88400	92000	it clearly demonstrates how much this has exploded in the last few years.
92000	96240	If you look at the graph, you'll notice that it has increased at an unbelievably exponential
96240	97240	rate.
97240	100800	But as the old adage goes, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.
100800	104120	And with this, many are beginning to wonder whether it's a bubble waiting to burst.
104120	108840	One of those people was the wolf on Wall Street himself, Jordan Belfort, whose autobiographical
108840	112360	fall from grace was the source material for the Martin Scorsese feature film.
112360	116760	In an interview with CNN, he claimed that the cryptocurrency was quote unquote a big
116760	120000	scam and projected the value of bitcoin would plummet greatly.
120000	123920	Belfort outlines a very interesting theory that is more relevant to cryptocurrencies
123920	127020	than almost any other market, the hype victim theory.
127020	130640	Now that can happen in any industry where something is hyped up and therefore its value
130640	135280	increases, however eventually there is this revelation of the illusion and it collapses.
135280	139320	However with bitcoin and any other currency, the hype is a snowball effect because people
139320	142960	buy into it and therefore encourage the notion that it is increasing in value.
142960	146840	This is particularly noticeable when you look at the buyer seller ratio, if that ratio was
146840	150080	applied to many other stocks, they would be shooting through the roof.
150080	154240	Which is why cryptocurrencies do have their moments of crashing very severely because
154240	158520	something conducting a sell of a large volume could trigger the misconception the whole
158520	160120	currency is collapsing.
160120	164080	That's less prominent with bitcoin as it's a slightly more stable crypto than its competitors,
164080	168840	but there's no doubt that a lot of bitcoin's current success is a result of its own hype.
168840	172640	What Belfort is suggesting is that there are a select few who are looking to make a lot
172640	177600	of money publicising and emphasising success through various techniques, which in effect
177600	179760	builds up hype and increases investment.
179760	183480	That investment leads to further hype, media articles about how bitcoin is skyrocketing
183480	187880	for example, at which point you enter a hype investment cycle, until someone breaks that
187880	191300	cycle and bitcoin's true value is seen for what it is.
191300	193320	Is Belfort a trustworthy source though?
193320	197540	Maybe, as noted in the article, he has his fair experience with shares and scams.
197540	201680	Now obviously there are differences between Belfort's example and bitcoin, but Belfort
201680	205160	is right that there are a lot of self-centred people who probably see this as an opportunity
205160	206240	to make a lot of money.
206240	210000	With that said, how much influence they're having and whether that influences altering
210000	215000	bitcoin's value at all is another question, and one that we can't necessarily answer.
215000	217540	Essentially it's a no until the answer's yes.
217540	221460	Now we're not comparing bitcoin to Belfort beyond conceptual knowledge, in that instance
221460	225620	the scams landed him in prison, if bitcoin crashed tomorrow would anyone who manipulated
225620	227500	it by publicising it go to prison?
227500	228500	Unlikely.
228500	231980	You can't really depict people's motivations for over-hyping something, and this isn't
231980	236660	an example of defrauding on Belfort's scale, it's not accountable to one person.
236660	238940	Bitcoin doesn't work like that.
238940	239940	What does this mean?
239940	244560	If bitcoin is a scam whose stocks have been manipulated by profit-driven individuals,
244560	248360	it will only be realised too late, there will be losers, there always are.
248360	252200	We also cannot tell when the manipulation started and how badly the effect will truly
252200	253360	be due to that.
253360	257840	We've reached a very unique situation where bitcoin is being valued more as an investment
257840	260280	product than what it originally represented.
260280	264200	That clouds the judgement of its true value and therefore makes it incredibly difficult
264200	267720	to decipher how such a claim like Belfort's would be addressed.
267720	269940	What lies in the future for bitcoin then?
269940	274800	We can be certain that it will peak, but its response after is what will decide its future
274800	277080	of many, many investors.
277080	280740	I'd like to thank Michael Voll and Lord Seago for proofreading my script, because
280740	284720	I didn't want to get any of the details wrong, and I want to thank them for verifying
284720	287800	it, and I would love to hear what your thoughts are as well.
287800	289080	Are there any investors out there?
289080	292600	I would be more than delighted to hear your input below.
292600	295560	Until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
307080	318960	Peace.
