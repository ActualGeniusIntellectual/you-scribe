00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
A little thought piece here.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,660
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,760
too much free time.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,600
And I enjoy trading, I recently got into the habit of day trading, where you put some money

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,140
in, let it go somewhere and take it out, with the premise that hopefully you've made a bit

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,140
of dollar here and there.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,640
One of my favourites for day trading are the cryptocurrencies, their volatility allows

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,240
you to make money fairly easily.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,440
Day trading for me is a nice pastime, however as I learned recently when I fell asleep with

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,400
money in the game, it's best to do it when you have a bit more free time.

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,560
At the forefront of cryptocurrencies is Bitcoin, one that I've actually avoided.

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,920
Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to appear.

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,700
The basic premise of cryptocurrencies is that they're not owned by a single government and

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,680
it doesn't experience taxation or inflation by effect.

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,320
It is handled by an online blockchain which to sum up is where a record of these transactions

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,320
are stored.

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,040
One of the very unique traits of cryptocurrency is that it's very difficult to commit fraud

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59,080
as the online blockchain means that the cryptocurrency can be tied down to a specific consumer, so

19
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,160
that consumer does truly own the Bitcoin they have.

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,500
Now there are many more specific details that if I were to include, would probably confuse

21
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,360
you more than it has already confused me.

22
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,440
Now as I said, at the centre of cryptocurrencies is Bitcoin, which has caused a lot of excitement

23
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,480
recently due to its inflating value, with many investors funding it with the faith that

24
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,040
it will continue to increase.

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,440
To put it into perspective, whereas 6 years ago, one bitcoin would have approximately

26
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,000
been worth $1, it is at the time of writing this, worth over $18,000.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,400
Now it may be a bit less when this video is released because it is that changeable, but

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,000
it clearly demonstrates how much this has exploded in the last few years.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,240
If you look at the graph, you'll notice that it has increased at an unbelievably exponential

30
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,240
rate.

31
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,800
But as the old adage goes, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.

32
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,120
And with this, many are beginning to wonder whether it's a bubble waiting to burst.

33
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,840
One of those people was the wolf on Wall Street himself, Jordan Belfort, whose autobiographical

34
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,360
fall from grace was the source material for the Martin Scorsese feature film.

35
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,760
In an interview with CNN, he claimed that the cryptocurrency was quote unquote a big

36
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,000
scam and projected the value of bitcoin would plummet greatly.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,920
Belfort outlines a very interesting theory that is more relevant to cryptocurrencies

38
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,020
than almost any other market, the hype victim theory.

39
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,640
Now that can happen in any industry where something is hyped up and therefore its value

40
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,280
increases, however eventually there is this revelation of the illusion and it collapses.

41
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,320
However with bitcoin and any other currency, the hype is a snowball effect because people

42
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,960
buy into it and therefore encourage the notion that it is increasing in value.

43
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,840
This is particularly noticeable when you look at the buyer seller ratio, if that ratio was

44
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,080
applied to many other stocks, they would be shooting through the roof.

45
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,240
Which is why cryptocurrencies do have their moments of crashing very severely because

46
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,520
something conducting a sell of a large volume could trigger the misconception the whole

47
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,120
currency is collapsing.

48
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,080
That's less prominent with bitcoin as it's a slightly more stable crypto than its competitors,

49
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,840
but there's no doubt that a lot of bitcoin's current success is a result of its own hype.

50
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,640
What Belfort is suggesting is that there are a select few who are looking to make a lot

51
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,600
of money publicising and emphasising success through various techniques, which in effect

52
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,760
builds up hype and increases investment.

53
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,480
That investment leads to further hype, media articles about how bitcoin is skyrocketing

54
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,880
for example, at which point you enter a hype investment cycle, until someone breaks that

55
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,300
cycle and bitcoin's true value is seen for what it is.

56
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,320
Is Belfort a trustworthy source though?

57
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,540
Maybe, as noted in the article, he has his fair experience with shares and scams.

58
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,680
Now obviously there are differences between Belfort's example and bitcoin, but Belfort

59
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,160
is right that there are a lot of self-centred people who probably see this as an opportunity

60
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,240
to make a lot of money.

61
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,000
With that said, how much influence they're having and whether that influences altering

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
bitcoin's value at all is another question, and one that we can't necessarily answer.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,540
Essentially it's a no until the answer's yes.

64
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,460
Now we're not comparing bitcoin to Belfort beyond conceptual knowledge, in that instance

65
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,620
the scams landed him in prison, if bitcoin crashed tomorrow would anyone who manipulated

66
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,500
it by publicising it go to prison?

67
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,500
Unlikely.

68
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,980
You can't really depict people's motivations for over-hyping something, and this isn't

69
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,660
an example of defrauding on Belfort's scale, it's not accountable to one person.

70
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,940
Bitcoin doesn't work like that.

71
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,940
What does this mean?

72
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,560
If bitcoin is a scam whose stocks have been manipulated by profit-driven individuals,

73
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,360
it will only be realised too late, there will be losers, there always are.

74
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,200
We also cannot tell when the manipulation started and how badly the effect will truly

75
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,360
be due to that.

76
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,840
We've reached a very unique situation where bitcoin is being valued more as an investment

77
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,280
product than what it originally represented.

78
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,200
That clouds the judgement of its true value and therefore makes it incredibly difficult

79
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,720
to decipher how such a claim like Belfort's would be addressed.

80
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,940
What lies in the future for bitcoin then?

81
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:34,800
We can be certain that it will peak, but its response after is what will decide its future

82
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,080
of many, many investors.

83
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,740
I'd like to thank Michael Voll and Lord Seago for proofreading my script, because

84
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,720
I didn't want to get any of the details wrong, and I want to thank them for verifying

85
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,800
it, and I would love to hear what your thoughts are as well.

86
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,080
Are there any investors out there?

87
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,600
I would be more than delighted to hear your input below.

88
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,560
Until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

89
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:18,960
Peace.
