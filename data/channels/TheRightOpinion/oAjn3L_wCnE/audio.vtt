00:28.080 --> 00:33.280
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

00:33.280 --> 00:37.520
And today, we're gonna be reacting to Danielle Bregoli on Dr. Phil!

00:37.520 --> 00:41.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what the fuck do you think you're doing here, Benji?

00:41.360 --> 00:43.040
What on earth do you think you're doing? Shut up!

00:43.040 --> 00:47.200
Well, dude, since you've been changing your content recently, I thought I would modernize it.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.120
That's the word you use, right? Modernize?

00:49.120 --> 00:54.560
Oh, look at me, I'm The Right Opinion, and this mutiny of my content creation hub is a travesty.

00:54.560 --> 00:57.200
Hmm, let me publish a thesis on this catastrophe.

00:57.200 --> 01:01.920
I love to use a prolific amount of big boy words because I'm insecure about my monocle.

01:01.920 --> 01:04.320
You are not an invited guest. Goodbye.

01:05.280 --> 01:08.400
This is a right opinion video, not a democracy.

01:08.400 --> 01:12.880
And although topics have changed, I'll still be covering some more serious issues that you're familiar with.

01:12.880 --> 01:15.840
Basically, I'll be doing what I find fun and somewhat original,

01:15.840 --> 01:18.960
and I hope you guys in the Tro family will find it fun too.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.800
But let's talk about family for a moment.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.800
Whether that family is biological, adopted,

01:22.800 --> 01:25.440
or just a group of people that you share a unique connection with,

01:25.440 --> 01:27.760
they play a real role in shaping you as a person,

01:27.760 --> 01:29.920
and can help you through some of your hardest times.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.520
That should never be underrated.

01:31.520 --> 01:33.360
But what if that family is Greg Paul?

01:34.080 --> 01:37.280
Well, that's the scenario that Jake and Logan find themselves in.

01:37.280 --> 01:41.280
It makes sense, he's their biological father, but he's not your normal dad of a YouTuber,

01:41.280 --> 01:44.000
the one who stands, hopefully supportively, on the sidelines.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.160
He clearly enjoys basking in the spotlight,

01:46.160 --> 01:48.960
and on principle there is nothing wrong with that time of the belief that

01:48.960 --> 01:51.120
age should not constrain one's capacity,

01:51.120 --> 01:53.120
and even if the doorway is via nepotism,

01:53.120 --> 01:57.280
they may still have the character independent from the familial factor to redeem that.

01:57.280 --> 02:00.320
The 54 year old is a character without a doubt,

02:00.320 --> 02:02.960
but he clearly does want to involve himself in his son's lives,

02:02.960 --> 02:04.240
and we'll touch on this later.

02:04.240 --> 02:07.360
Jake and Logan Paul have established clout within their own rights,

02:07.360 --> 02:09.920
but still appear to appreciate the presence of their father.

02:09.920 --> 02:12.240
In one event, which I won't be discussing today,

02:12.240 --> 02:14.160
Gregory here featured in one of Jake's videos,

02:14.160 --> 02:15.360
and made out with a fan,

02:15.360 --> 02:17.680
and although it's weird and marginally unsettling,

02:17.680 --> 02:20.000
it's been ran into the ground by everyone under the sun,

02:20.000 --> 02:22.400
and I think people have mostly made their mind up on it.

02:23.440 --> 02:27.120
However, it is important that we provide some background for what inspired this video.

02:27.120 --> 02:31.040
It was May, the Earth was rotating on its axis like any normal day,

02:31.040 --> 02:33.040
but it wasn't any normal day for Team 10,

02:33.040 --> 02:36.720
in fact it was quite an eventful period of time for Jake Paul and his comrades,

02:36.720 --> 02:39.200
because on May the 5th, the COO of Team 10,

02:39.200 --> 02:43.600
Nick Crompton, you know, the person who claimed that England was his city, stepped down.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.480
Nick Crompton had been noted for his staunch devotion to Jake Paul,

02:46.480 --> 02:49.360
and even in his divorce statement, he kept it relatively civil,

02:49.360 --> 02:51.520
and urged people not to blindly hate on Jake.

02:51.520 --> 02:54.800
However, an indirect recipient of the underlying message within the letter

02:54.800 --> 02:56.800
seemed to be Mr. Gregory Paul himself.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.640
It was also not long before Charles Sutton,

02:58.640 --> 03:00.560
another highly distinguished member of the troop,

03:00.560 --> 03:02.400
decided it was time for him to part ways,

03:02.400 --> 03:06.000
and eventually, after a fair bit of digging, various hypotheses were stated.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.640
The main one being that Greg Paul, in question,

03:08.640 --> 03:12.000
had assumed control of many of Jake's assets within the Team 10 business,

03:12.000 --> 03:13.920
and had since been making some ruthless cut.

03:13.920 --> 03:18.800
To put it quaintly, he had taken up the role of Team 10's own personal human resources department.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.560
There were some elaborate stories,

03:20.560 --> 03:23.200
some that included various details of possible merger,

03:23.200 --> 03:25.440
and more individual developments that we'll discuss later,

03:25.440 --> 03:29.120
but that is the core story that is mostly confirmed from both sides.

03:29.120 --> 03:32.560
I follow this vaguely, and often it's something I would not rather touch on,

03:32.560 --> 03:35.200
but I do believe there is a greater commentary that can be made out of

03:35.200 --> 03:39.040
Greg Paul, his demeanour, and various relationships that this story encompasses.

03:39.040 --> 03:41.920
Both Jake and Logan have their fair share of controversies,

03:41.920 --> 03:44.320
Logan with the obvious, and Jake with the consistency,

03:44.320 --> 03:47.120
and once again I stress that Jake and Logan can act how they want,

03:47.120 --> 03:49.040
and the public will judge them as they do,

03:49.040 --> 03:52.720
but if they want to be slightly more positive role models than the ones they're currently,

03:52.720 --> 03:55.440
a mediating actor could be genuinely beneficial.

03:55.440 --> 03:56.800
However, what I've found today,

03:56.800 --> 04:00.400
tends to lend support to the fact that this could actually be rather detrimental.

04:01.280 --> 04:03.280
No one's obliged to be great human beings,

04:03.280 --> 04:06.080
however if you want to lecture people on what's right and what's wrong,

04:06.080 --> 04:07.680
you better practice what you preach,

04:07.680 --> 04:11.280
something that I find fundamentally lacking for all parties involved today.

04:11.280 --> 04:12.720
I never do things lightweight here,

04:12.720 --> 04:15.600
and although I'm leaning very heavily on the trending topic genre,

04:15.600 --> 04:17.280
moreover than I ever have in the past,

04:17.280 --> 04:21.520
do not expect any less of a serious analysis with various hypotheses integrated.

04:21.520 --> 04:24.720
This is what we do here, on the right fucking opinion.

04:26.880 --> 04:30.160
So, without further ado, let's get to it.

04:41.360 --> 04:52.000
I think it's best to start an analysis with a bit of background.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.280
Greg Paul started up his Vine in light of Logan and Jake's success,

04:55.280 --> 04:57.520
and although the Vine account doesn't appear to be up anymore,

04:57.520 --> 05:01.200
I have found a compilation of clips that seem to reflect the sort of content that he made.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.760
Given the fact that obviously his sons had Vine accounts too,

05:03.760 --> 05:07.120
it's fairly easy to compare and contrast the sort of content that they produced.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.200
Logan and Jake had a high energy style,

05:09.200 --> 05:11.840
that whether you find funny or not, clearly had its appeal.

05:11.840 --> 05:14.240
It was well produced, the punchlines were mostly on point,

05:14.240 --> 05:16.800
and their choice of topics were diverse enough to have a novelty,

05:16.800 --> 05:18.720
while similar enough to retain an audience.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.960
Greg's content tended to revolve around a few things,

05:20.960 --> 05:24.880
either captioning videos on the internet, interacting with his family, or yoga.

05:24.880 --> 05:26.400
It's an interesting compilation.

05:26.400 --> 05:30.240
Now, as intriguing as the yoga might be, I'm more interested in the second point there.

05:30.240 --> 05:34.560
You see, through these, Greg Paul built his reputation as Logan and Jake Paul's dad.

05:34.560 --> 05:35.760
Duh, I hear you say.

05:35.760 --> 05:36.960
Well, that's who he is.

05:36.960 --> 05:38.160
But it's not that simple.

05:38.160 --> 05:41.280
For example, I assume most of the audience watching this video have parents,

05:41.280 --> 05:44.560
but those parents don't go around branding themselves as your parents,

05:44.560 --> 05:46.080
although it is factually true.

05:46.080 --> 05:49.680
A significant proportion of Greg Paul's Vine and subsequent YouTube content

05:49.680 --> 05:52.720
is dedicated to the misadventures with his two sons.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.600
It makes sense, and I'm not saying it's a necessarily bad thing,

05:55.600 --> 05:57.840
but it does set up premises for later statements.

05:57.840 --> 06:00.000
It means that instead of really growing his own clout,

06:00.000 --> 06:03.360
nearly all of his followers are confined within the Paul brothers circle.

06:03.360 --> 06:06.800
This also means it makes a lot of interactions between the Paul family public,

06:06.800 --> 06:09.520
which is okay again, considering Greg does seem to enjoy it.

06:09.520 --> 06:11.120
But when dealing with certain levels of drama,

06:11.120 --> 06:13.360
although it is family nature to defend the ones you love,

06:13.360 --> 06:15.840
other times responding can just make you look worse,

06:15.840 --> 06:18.240
and trying to justify unjustifiable actions

06:18.240 --> 06:21.040
becomes much harder when you have journalistic attention.

06:21.040 --> 06:24.720
Now, on the surface, a fair majority of his content is fairly harmless.

06:24.720 --> 06:28.000
However, you can see how a mindset is created in most of his quote,

06:28.000 --> 06:31.760
harmless content that follows into some of the more challenging videos of his,

06:31.760 --> 06:33.920
particularly those surrounding drama.

06:33.920 --> 06:37.440
So to get to the crux of the matter, we have to brush away at the surface first.

06:37.440 --> 06:40.480
I think it's time to discuss the manufactured love.

06:40.480 --> 06:42.240
Everyone needs a bit of love in their life,

06:42.240 --> 06:45.520
but Greg Paul milks that simple fact until the cows come home.

06:45.520 --> 06:48.880
It's kind of a meme, the more senior individuals within society

06:48.880 --> 06:50.640
act slightly unnaturally online,

06:50.640 --> 06:53.200
but Greg Paul seems to be a victim of that theory.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.440
He bases his actions on the notion of love,

06:55.440 --> 06:58.080
he's the sort of guy who would punch you in the name of love.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.880
The haters knew how much love was out there and how much support was out there,

07:00.880 --> 07:02.160
they'd shut their freaking mouths.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.200
There's one video that kind of pushes this example,

07:05.200 --> 07:07.920
it's the video in which Greg Paul confronts paparazzi.

07:07.920 --> 07:10.720
Now, it would take someone very talented to make me feel sorry

07:10.720 --> 07:13.440
for individuals who follow you around everywhere and take pictures,

07:13.440 --> 07:15.840
and I'm not sure Greg Paul quite achieves that,

07:15.840 --> 07:17.520
but I'll give him points for trying.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.640
Being loud and obnoxious, being all in your face,

07:20.640 --> 07:22.240
it's all for the love, my man.

07:22.240 --> 07:23.200
Gotta have that love.

07:23.920 --> 07:26.880
I've been talking about intentions a lot on this channel recently.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.400
I said in my Nicole Arber video,

07:28.400 --> 07:31.600
the good causes do not absolve terrible execution.

07:31.600 --> 07:34.400
I do believe that many of these adults are quite aware of that,

07:34.400 --> 07:35.280
they're not stupid.

07:35.280 --> 07:39.040
I think Greg Paul's expression of this notion is excessively transparent,

07:39.040 --> 07:41.200
but nonetheless, in spite of its contrivances,

07:41.200 --> 07:43.040
some people still eat that shit up.

07:43.040 --> 07:45.840
Despite the simple truth that if he'd done all the same things,

07:45.840 --> 07:47.680
just out of anger or vitriol,

07:47.680 --> 07:49.840
he wouldn't be given the same treatment.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.280
Why is this?

07:51.280 --> 07:53.200
Well, people like to justify their actions,

07:53.200 --> 07:56.800
even when their actions may seem illogical to the individual in question.

07:56.800 --> 08:01.040
Now, I have no doubt that there is a rationale behind the way that Greg Paul behaves,

08:01.040 --> 08:02.880
but love is not that rationale.

08:02.880 --> 08:05.760
Love is what he uses as a shield to deflect the idea

08:05.760 --> 08:08.960
that sometimes he behaves in a less than socially aware manner.

08:08.960 --> 08:11.440
This becomes increasingly transparent when you turn

08:11.440 --> 08:14.320
to some of the more controversial statements that he put out.

08:14.320 --> 08:17.200
My favorite video being the one he posted on his Instagram,

08:17.200 --> 08:19.680
in response to the scrutiny Logan received,

08:19.680 --> 08:22.240
many of it I'd argue justifiably so.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.360
He made this statement.

08:26.720 --> 08:28.560
Yo folks, what's happening?

08:28.640 --> 08:29.760
GP coming at you.

08:29.760 --> 08:32.560
Hey, a couple things I want to let everybody know that Logan is coming back.

08:32.560 --> 08:33.360
That is definite.

08:33.920 --> 08:36.080
A little bit of the bus update.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.760
I put a new insulated floor in.

08:38.560 --> 08:40.400
I've got some kitchen cabinets going in.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.800
I've got a couple dressers I'm going to use for storage.

08:43.520 --> 08:44.880
And it's coming along nice.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.480
I'm having fun with this thing.

08:46.480 --> 08:50.800
Also, the amount of love that has been coming has been unbelievable.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.720
The amount of people showing support is unbelievable.

08:52.720 --> 08:54.720
And I am now calling you guys super fans.

08:55.600 --> 08:56.800
Because, you know, it's crazy.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.800
As the haters think they're having an effect on us,

08:58.800 --> 09:00.560
and if the haters knew how much love was out there

09:00.560 --> 09:01.840
and how much support was out there,

09:01.840 --> 09:03.200
they'd shut their freaking mouths.

09:03.840 --> 09:07.520
The haters will never, ever have an effect on the Paul family

09:07.520 --> 09:09.280
and the way that they want to make it happen,

09:09.280 --> 09:10.640
because the love is too strong.

09:10.640 --> 09:11.600
We all make mistakes.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.760
Dr. Phil even said, hey, Logan's a good kid.

09:13.760 --> 09:14.480
He's made a mistake.

09:14.480 --> 09:15.520
He's 22 years old.

09:16.560 --> 09:18.400
Push through it, get over it, and keep moving on.

09:18.400 --> 09:19.520
Anyways, love you guys.

09:19.520 --> 09:20.240
Love the support.

09:20.800 --> 09:21.520
GP's out.

09:22.160 --> 09:25.920
What Greg has done here is create a dichotomy from his earlier content,

09:25.920 --> 09:27.600
where he preaches love and kindness.

09:27.600 --> 09:31.280
And therefore, what he does here is equivocate his being to love.

09:31.280 --> 09:34.800
And therefore, if you are opposed to the Pauls, you are thus opposed to love.

09:34.800 --> 09:38.320
And on top of that, you're not just opposed to love, you are a hater.

09:38.320 --> 09:40.640
There is no clarification on the sort of hate.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.800
He doesn't qualify it with any statement.

09:42.800 --> 09:46.880
It's just the haters won't get to him because he's got all this love inside of him.

09:46.880 --> 09:50.240
Listen, there were clearly people who probably responded to Logan's actions

09:50.240 --> 09:54.080
as irresponsible as they were in an irrational and disproportionate manner.

09:54.080 --> 09:58.080
But Greg doesn't concern himself to clarify that he may be addressing a fringe group.

09:58.080 --> 10:02.480
He's more interested in blanket statements and labels to give his fans that validation.

10:02.480 --> 10:05.920
And even if he was addressing a fringe group, it would seem like a deflection anyway,

10:05.920 --> 10:08.800
especially if you're not going to directly address it.

10:08.800 --> 10:12.880
Also, general terminology, saying that people you claim to be haters would quote,

10:12.880 --> 10:18.000
shut their freaking mouths if they knew about all the love you have, is a bit of a contradiction.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.480
Greg always appeals to these basic emotional concepts as a way to distract from the fact

10:22.480 --> 10:25.360
there is no real way to defend how people act sometimes.

10:25.360 --> 10:29.360
But as long as he holds down that love sector, these people, they're just haters,

10:29.360 --> 10:31.600
and he's got the love right here to hold them off.

10:31.600 --> 10:36.640
So what was Greg referring to when he mentioned that transcendent concept of love that was just

10:36.640 --> 10:37.600
out there?

10:37.600 --> 10:41.200
Well, one of the other observations I made was how Greg likes to reflect

10:41.200 --> 10:43.920
and discuss all the people that he and Jake have assisted.

10:43.920 --> 10:48.160
And Logan, of course, I believe he uses this as mental justification in his own head

10:48.160 --> 10:50.080
for the wrongdoings that may be committed.

10:50.080 --> 10:55.680
I have had DMs with a lot of people talking about issues,

10:55.680 --> 10:59.440
talking about them trying to commit suicide, and I've responded to a lot of people

10:59.440 --> 11:02.640
said, hey, be strong, appreciate your writing, things like that.

11:02.640 --> 11:05.120
I also noticed this on one of Jake's diss tracks,

11:05.120 --> 11:08.240
in which he responds to criticism by talking about the great stuff he does.

11:20.080 --> 11:30.400
If you fuck up and you accept you fuck up,

11:30.400 --> 11:34.320
the best thing to do is remember that you have the capacity to do good with that influence

11:34.320 --> 11:37.360
rather than attempting to retell all the times that you've done good

11:37.360 --> 11:40.080
or noting it as some general love, because by doing that,

11:40.080 --> 11:43.200
it immediately trivializes the actions that you have committed

11:43.200 --> 11:44.960
and the motivations for committing them.

11:45.040 --> 11:47.120
As the famous philosopher Cool Cat once said,

11:54.320 --> 11:57.520
I'd also like to bring attention to what I call the loyalty card,

11:57.520 --> 12:01.040
which isn't exactly the one you use in the supermache per se.

12:01.040 --> 12:02.880
No, I mean the sort of one that's used by people

12:02.880 --> 12:05.680
when they thank those for standing by them through the tough times.

12:05.680 --> 12:08.400
In this instance, Greg Paul's use of the loyalty cards

12:08.400 --> 12:10.480
upgrades the fans to super fans,

12:11.440 --> 12:16.320
which of course means absolutely nothing to anyone above the age of 12,

12:16.320 --> 12:18.800
but is a sort of emotional reward that may gratify

12:18.800 --> 12:21.520
the sort of unconditional supporter of the Pauls.

12:21.520 --> 12:24.640
It's always nice to experience appreciation from those we admire,

12:24.640 --> 12:27.120
however most of us are at that age where we realize

12:27.120 --> 12:30.400
the impersonality of YouTube celebrities saying it through the screen.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.640
Basically, it probably doesn't mean much,

12:32.640 --> 12:35.360
but if there's anything that the Paul fanbase has taught us,

12:35.360 --> 12:38.240
is that people are still very easily influenced.

12:38.240 --> 12:41.280
Now, the loyalty card isn't an intrinsically bad asset,

12:41.280 --> 12:44.080
plenty of creators have it and use it on a regular basis,

12:44.080 --> 12:45.280
it is natural in a way,

12:45.280 --> 12:47.600
but when you abuse it to the level of Greg Paul,

12:47.600 --> 12:50.000
the loyalty becomes a tool to override logic,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.320
and I want you to hold on to this point for later.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.240
It's been a while since I've had a guest on,

12:54.240 --> 12:57.200
so I thought I'd mix it up and bring in my good friend Urbot,

12:57.200 --> 12:58.400
also known as Wooly One,

12:58.400 --> 13:01.840
and he did some research into Greg Paul's cyberbullying escapades.

13:01.840 --> 13:02.880
Not sure what that is?

13:02.880 --> 13:04.320
Well, you're in for a treat.

13:04.320 --> 13:05.360
Take it away my friend.

13:05.360 --> 13:08.880
Hello everyone, I'm Wooly One,

13:08.880 --> 13:11.360
contributing-pologist on The Right Opinion's channel.

13:11.920 --> 13:14.880
So Greg Paul, being a 54-year-old man,

13:14.880 --> 13:17.520
has found it difficult to fit in on the internet.

13:17.520 --> 13:20.880
From some of his videos, it's clear he simply does not understand

13:20.880 --> 13:24.560
how basic things that YouTubers deal with every day work.

13:24.560 --> 13:27.760
And it's not just through his somewhat cringey persona,

13:27.760 --> 13:30.160
it's through the ideas that he has suggested.

13:30.160 --> 13:33.520
The example we are going to look at today is cyberbullying.

13:33.520 --> 13:36.400
Now, cyberbullying is a very new form of harassment

13:36.400 --> 13:39.200
because it takes place on a very new medium, the internet.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.600
It's also an incredibly easy form of harassment

13:41.600 --> 13:45.360
because you can get the satisfaction of speaking your mind about another person

13:45.360 --> 13:47.600
without having to see their reaction live.

13:47.600 --> 13:51.520
Louis CK, you know, the comedian, the guy who,

13:51.520 --> 13:54.240
yeah, he put it best in an interview with Conan O'Brien.

13:54.240 --> 13:56.960
So kids are mean and it's because they're trying it out.

13:58.560 --> 13:59.520
They look at a kid and they go,

13:59.520 --> 14:02.640
you're fat, and then they see the kid's face scrunch up and they go,

14:02.640 --> 14:05.120
ooh, that doesn't feel good to make a person do that.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.680
But they got to start with doing the mean thing.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.800
Because these insults are bytes and data

14:10.800 --> 14:14.160
seemingly posted by one person and received by another,

14:14.160 --> 14:17.360
Greg Paul thinks this issue can easily be solved.

14:17.360 --> 14:21.520
About a year ago, Greg Paul posted a very interesting video titled,

14:21.520 --> 14:25.760
Cyberbullying is real! My thoughts on everything Logan and Jake Paul.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.440
Hashtag the second verse.

14:27.440 --> 14:30.480
He starts off by addressing some of the hot rumors at the time,

14:30.480 --> 14:34.400
particularly the Alyssa Violet situation, which James will touch on later.

14:34.400 --> 14:37.680
He makes a really weird point about perception versus reality,

14:37.680 --> 14:41.040
where he calls out Jake and Logan's own pranks by name,

14:41.040 --> 14:43.200
and he tells you that they were staged.

14:43.200 --> 14:46.240
Just remember, a lot of the same people coming at me

14:47.120 --> 14:48.800
really believed Jake was in the White House.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.440
They really believed Dwarf Mamba was shipped in an airplane.

14:52.000 --> 14:52.880
None of it was true.

14:52.880 --> 14:55.680
But then he tries to connect it back to the truth

14:55.680 --> 14:57.360
and how the viewers perceive the truth.

14:57.360 --> 15:02.400
And a lot of it is somebody's perception of how they saw things.

15:02.400 --> 15:05.600
He basically leaves you with the impression that it was the viewers' fault

15:05.600 --> 15:08.240
that they didn't understand that the pranks were staged.

15:08.240 --> 15:11.840
And in a similar way, they don't understand the Alyssa Violet situation.

15:11.840 --> 15:15.760
It's a very loose connection that doesn't really seem to help his case.

15:15.760 --> 15:20.240
After all, if Jake and Logan Paul wanted their viewers to get the right idea about their content,

15:20.240 --> 15:21.920
why don't they just not lie to them?

15:21.920 --> 15:24.800
About five minutes in though, he switches gears.

15:24.800 --> 15:30.000
You see, in his coverage of this Alyssa Violet situation, he's received a great deal of hate.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.120
Now, most YouTubers would probably just block and ignore them.

15:33.120 --> 15:35.440
But Greg Paul has a different idea.

15:35.440 --> 15:38.240
Instead, he proposes a cyberbullying database

15:38.240 --> 15:40.720
where people are named and branded as cyberbullies.

15:54.800 --> 16:08.720
And this database can be accessed by, well, pretty much anyone.

16:08.720 --> 16:12.480
Parents, teachers, employers, significant others, and yes, the police.

16:12.480 --> 16:15.600
If this idea sounds extremely Orwellian and horrible,

16:15.600 --> 16:18.560
you're thinking at least a little more rationally than Greg here.

16:18.560 --> 16:23.200
There are so many problems with a database of this nature that become immediately apparent.

16:23.200 --> 16:26.160
For example, that most threats are made anonymously,

16:26.160 --> 16:28.960
and without an extremely invasive police investigation,

16:28.960 --> 16:34.320
the only identification people would have access to would be their general location, if that at all.

16:34.320 --> 16:39.200
But let's assume, as Greg does, that one would be able to easily log this information.

16:39.200 --> 16:42.560
He still essentially wants a nine-year-old telling you to KYS

16:42.560 --> 16:45.120
to be treated with the same severity and seriousness

16:45.120 --> 16:49.600
as a 60-year-old homeless man whipping his dick out in front of preschoolers on a playground.

16:49.600 --> 16:52.240
Even to most of the technologically inept,

16:52.240 --> 16:54.880
this sounds incredibly stupid and ineffective.

16:54.880 --> 16:59.440
Not to mention how easy it would be to fake the evidence with Inspect Element or Photoshop,

16:59.440 --> 17:01.840
two things that Greg probably hasn't even heard of.

17:01.840 --> 17:02.960
It just wouldn't work.

17:02.960 --> 17:05.680
And while Greg may be a seasoned human being,

17:05.680 --> 17:08.320
he's not a seasoned YouTuber, so he just doesn't get it.

17:08.880 --> 17:14.080
Well, fast forward a year and prepubescent YouTube commenters with anime profile pictures

17:14.080 --> 17:16.800
have not been rounded up and shot into mass graves yet.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.400
So what happened?

17:18.400 --> 17:19.600
Well, nothing, I guess.

17:19.600 --> 17:23.360
For a few months after his video, he continued talking on Instagram

17:23.360 --> 17:27.520
about how he was definitely going to create this database and how he was going to do it right.

17:27.520 --> 17:32.080
Like his video, he also mentioned working with the LAPD to get it off the ground.

17:32.080 --> 17:35.440
And each time, he promised to do away with these vile cyberbullies

17:35.440 --> 17:38.560
who'd been sending hate to him, but it just never happened.

17:38.560 --> 17:41.760
There still is no database, and I doubt there ever will be.

17:41.760 --> 17:42.320
Why?

17:42.320 --> 17:45.520
Well, maybe he realized how much of an idiotic concept this was

17:45.520 --> 17:48.080
from the numerous comments and dislikes on the video.

17:48.080 --> 17:51.440
Or maybe he never had any intention of creating such a database

17:51.440 --> 17:55.280
and only conceived of it as a threat to freak out those who were insulting him.

17:55.280 --> 17:57.520
Perhaps he was just doing it to make himself look better,

17:57.520 --> 18:02.240
especially considering he was in a video about an already highly controversial topic,

18:02.240 --> 18:06.240
using it as yet another means to shove his love down your throat and evade criticism.

18:06.240 --> 18:10.720
I think that one of the conclusions that can be drawn from the Greg Paul cyberbullying saga

18:10.720 --> 18:16.080
is that the man himself seems deeply concerned about others when something happens to him.

18:16.080 --> 18:17.280
Now, what do I mean by this?

18:17.280 --> 18:22.000
Well, in the video, he states constantly about how he doesn't care about all the hate he's received.

18:22.000 --> 18:22.500
Guess what?

18:23.040 --> 18:24.160
I don't care what you call me.

18:24.160 --> 18:24.640
Doesn't matter.

18:24.640 --> 18:27.040
The fact that you're calling me a faggot and you think it's offensive?

18:27.040 --> 18:27.360
Where are you?

18:27.360 --> 18:29.200
Are you living in 1952?

18:29.200 --> 18:30.880
This is 2017.

18:30.880 --> 18:34.960
If you got an issue with somebody in their sexual orientation, that's too bad for you.

18:34.960 --> 18:35.920
Those aren't my issues.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.840
The fact that you're calling me old and bald?

18:37.840 --> 18:38.560
I don't really care.

18:38.560 --> 18:42.000
Uh, a lot of you guys said you know why Pam and I got divorced?

18:42.000 --> 18:44.880
Listen, 50% of the couples out there get divorced.

18:44.880 --> 18:48.560
The 50% that are married, another 25% want to get divorced.

18:48.560 --> 18:53.120
So trying to slam me because I got divorced doesn't bother me.

18:53.120 --> 18:54.560
It has no value.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.320
It's all water off the duck's back for him.

18:56.320 --> 18:58.640
He's so resolute that you can call him a faggot.

18:58.640 --> 19:02.560
And if you're not down with the gays in 2017, well, that's your problem.

19:02.560 --> 19:06.560
However, Greg Paul is so concerned that it might happen to someone else

19:06.560 --> 19:08.960
that isn't as strong and resolute as him

19:08.960 --> 19:13.840
that he wants to set up this database that takes down everyone who says something mean.

19:13.840 --> 19:15.680
All you folks that sent me the hate mail,

19:16.800 --> 19:19.920
I think you're going to be the first ones that I expose

19:19.920 --> 19:24.880
and let the general public know that you guys are out there trying to be bullies.

19:24.880 --> 19:28.160
And listen, there's nothing wrong with looking out for other people.

19:28.160 --> 19:32.880
But when you suddenly start caring about something for the sole reason of it happening to you,

19:32.880 --> 19:37.520
saying that you don't care about the fact that it happens to you seems fairly hard to believe.

19:37.520 --> 19:42.880
And it seems like a real attempt to switch the fact that he's upset about what someone did to him

19:42.880 --> 19:48.160
as a way to simultaneously look better, like a crusader against all those bad, nasty bullies.

19:48.160 --> 19:52.240
But this is just indicative of how Greg Paul really tries to find

19:52.240 --> 19:56.000
anything that's happened to him as a way to pole vault himself into relevancy.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.920
He needs the spotlight to be on him.

19:57.920 --> 20:02.480
So by seizing the opportunity to do something revolutionary in his head,

20:02.480 --> 20:06.480
it would give him that attention, even when his reaction, as I showed earlier,

20:06.480 --> 20:10.800
is completely irrational and symptomatic of his technological naivety.

20:10.800 --> 20:12.320
Anyway, back to you, Jimbo.

20:12.880 --> 20:17.280
As noted earlier, this was part of a greater video on the Alyssa Violet situation,

20:17.280 --> 20:19.040
in which she left the Team 10 house.

20:19.040 --> 20:24.240
Both Jake and Alyssa told very contrasting stories about what exactly happened within the premises.

20:24.240 --> 20:27.280
But Greg Paul then decided to join in and tell his own story,

20:27.280 --> 20:29.120
which is interesting to say the least.

20:29.120 --> 20:32.160
In this story, he declared that Alyssa wasn't kicked out for cheating,

20:32.160 --> 20:35.840
as Jake claimed, or anything else, but she was removed for not paying rent.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.440
Alyssa wasn't kicked out of the house.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.160
She was asked to leave because she wasn't paying rent.

20:40.160 --> 20:43.920
And at the center of this bizarre story is the father, Mr. Greg Paul himself,

20:43.920 --> 20:47.680
who in spite of barely turning up in either of the other members' testaments,

20:47.680 --> 20:51.120
apart from a cameo in Alyssa's where she claimed he verbally abused her in public.

21:00.800 --> 21:02.720
He had a leading role in his story.

21:02.720 --> 21:06.560
In this retelling, Alyssa Violet was belligerently remaining in the Team 10 house,

21:06.560 --> 21:07.920
and she would not budge.

21:07.920 --> 21:11.760
Greg Paul, the gracious, cogent gentleman, sat down with her,

21:11.760 --> 21:15.520
and gave her some top-notch advice on that Greg Paul, the man himself,

21:15.520 --> 21:18.240
managed to bring her time at Team 10 to an end.

21:23.360 --> 21:26.720
In case you've noticed an undertone of sarcasm in my voice,

21:26.720 --> 21:29.120
it's because I am being fucking sarcastic.

21:29.120 --> 21:32.160
And frankly, this is some of the thickest bullshit that I've heard in a while.

21:33.040 --> 21:35.760
Warning! Warning! Bullshit alert!

21:35.760 --> 21:39.600
Greg Paul claims that a lot of Alyssa Violet's allegations cannot be backed up,

21:43.680 --> 21:47.760
before making a number of unsubstantiated claims himself and just saying,

21:47.760 --> 21:48.960
well it's the truth.

21:48.960 --> 21:53.520
She did miss auditions because of not being able to wake up and make it on time.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.560
These things are all the truth. These things actually happen.

21:56.560 --> 21:59.680
I also find it amusing that he has to interject multiple times in the video

21:59.680 --> 22:01.840
to remind the viewer that he is telling the truth,

22:01.840 --> 22:04.560
and reminds us all that everyone in Team 10 likes him,

22:04.560 --> 22:06.400
because he's hard working for those people.

22:27.040 --> 22:30.800
I'm not saying that he's not, but the self-validation is pretty suspicious.

22:30.800 --> 22:34.480
To prove his moral worth, he says that his level of truth is so strong

22:34.480 --> 22:38.240
that there are lawyers who have offered to take his case for free against Alyssa Violet,

22:38.240 --> 22:41.360
but he's not going to do that because he's above all the petty drama,

22:41.360 --> 22:43.280
he's above the lying and the hatred.

22:43.280 --> 22:46.720
He's so moral, don't we all wish we could be like Gregory here?

22:46.720 --> 22:47.920
Not quite, right?

22:48.560 --> 22:50.080
This tells me two things.

22:50.080 --> 22:53.120
Firstly, that Greg Paul is a pretty bad liar.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.720
There are multiple cues for lying,

22:54.720 --> 22:58.400
most notably the disturbing amount of times he licks his lips in that video.

23:00.800 --> 23:24.080
Which in comparison to his other videos is quite disproportionate,

23:24.080 --> 23:26.080
but who cares, maybe it was a hot day,

23:26.080 --> 23:30.080
Greg's lips have just been so dry in need of that constant moisturising.

23:30.080 --> 23:31.840
Maybe a boy just thirsty.

23:33.040 --> 23:35.760
After all, the biggest indicator that he's chatting shit

23:35.760 --> 23:38.800
is the story doesn't even match the one told by his son Jakey here.

23:38.800 --> 23:41.920
Jake claimed that Alyssa cheated on him, but maybe he was wrong too,

23:41.920 --> 23:43.600
maybe Greg is actually Thanos,

23:43.600 --> 23:47.120
and is using the reality stone to manipulate the world that Team 10 lives in.

23:47.120 --> 23:50.240
It's still more plausible than any of the stories that Greg is actually telling.

23:50.240 --> 23:53.120
Greg also has this perfect way of twisting what people say.

23:53.120 --> 23:56.880
He states that Alyssa saying that she thought he was going to pull a gun out was unfair,

23:56.880 --> 24:00.640
which as a point, a standalone point, I guess, stands,

24:00.640 --> 24:02.080
but then goes on to say this.

24:10.960 --> 24:14.720
Which given the additional context is a blatantly dishonest way of framing it,

24:14.720 --> 24:18.960
and anyone who understands basic rhetorical devices knows exactly what she's implying.

24:26.960 --> 24:31.280
And I think you do too, Greg.

24:31.280 --> 24:34.160
All I'm saying is you're not making a good case for yourself here, buddy.

24:34.160 --> 24:37.360
In fact, in another video where he once again truthfully recollects

24:37.360 --> 24:39.840
a story of the Martinez twins and their departure,

24:39.840 --> 24:43.680
he drops the disclaimer that he often makes very little eye contact with the camera,

24:43.680 --> 24:46.880
and that is normal behaviour, so don't try and investigate him for lying.

24:56.880 --> 25:01.280
After all, if you act like a liar all the time, people can't specifically call out the lies,

25:01.280 --> 25:03.520
although the licking lips are pretty excessive.

25:04.320 --> 25:05.120
Tasty.

25:05.120 --> 25:09.600
What I've found from all these videos is that Greg likes to insert himself into these situations,

25:09.600 --> 25:11.520
and be as intimate to the drama as possible.

25:11.520 --> 25:14.560
He takes credit for the savage shirt that the Martinez twins wear,

25:14.560 --> 25:16.400
says that they were referring to him as a dad,

25:16.400 --> 25:21.440
and wanted him to be their manager before this other manager came in and disrupted the whole situation.

25:21.680 --> 25:29.200
Every story involves him, despite many of the anecdotes

25:29.200 --> 25:32.400
from other individuals within the Team 10 house seldom including him.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.560
The details that Greg provides would lead you to believe that

25:34.560 --> 25:37.680
he's actually a member of Team 10, let alone involved in it.

25:37.680 --> 25:39.760
Why this level of involvement though?

25:39.760 --> 25:43.440
Well, one reason appears pretty obvious, that it's good for views and interaction,

25:43.440 --> 25:46.480
and people always want to hear the hottest takes from those in the know,

25:46.480 --> 25:50.640
and Greg Paul is definitely in the know, he's just not entirely in the tell.

25:50.640 --> 25:54.720
The other idea is that he likes to see himself as involved in his children's lives,

25:54.720 --> 25:57.360
which isn't a completely unreasonable explanation either,

25:57.360 --> 26:01.360
as I said at the start, he brands himself as the father to these two icons,

26:01.360 --> 26:06.400
above all other representations of his character, and his content plays into this narrative.

26:06.400 --> 26:09.920
But I want to reintroduce a couple of points that I mentioned briefly earlier.

26:09.920 --> 26:12.480
A lot of the issue that the Paul family tends to culminate

26:12.480 --> 26:14.880
is that their interactions are out in the public eye,

26:14.880 --> 26:17.120
and that's not a huge issue as principle,

26:17.120 --> 26:19.600
but as families we are more likely to defend each other,

26:19.600 --> 26:23.360
because we believe we know the character of the individual better than the criticism

26:23.360 --> 26:26.480
from the outsiders, and these people are intimate to our lives,

26:26.480 --> 26:29.200
we don't want conflict by publicly shouting them down,

26:29.200 --> 26:33.440
and frankly, I wouldn't expect Greg Paul to go around publicly lambasting his children,

26:33.440 --> 26:36.400
and if you want to defend them, then that's not necessarily a bad thing either,

26:36.400 --> 26:40.480
but there comes a point where defending an individual not just comes at a detriment to you,

26:40.480 --> 26:43.040
but to them and other individuals around them.

26:45.280 --> 26:48.320
If there's one thing that Jake and Logan's behaviour has taught us,

26:48.320 --> 26:51.760
is that they are really in desperate need of some real world experience.

26:51.760 --> 26:54.720
They're hardly children, but you'd be hard pressed to find behaviour

26:54.720 --> 26:56.560
that matches their respective maturity,

26:56.560 --> 26:59.360
whether it's obnoxiousness or just plain insensitivity,

26:59.360 --> 27:01.200
they seem to have all the boxes ticked.

27:01.200 --> 27:05.200
Much of their behaviour seems to lean onto the fact they don't recognise the implications

27:05.200 --> 27:07.200
that their actions have on those around them.

27:07.200 --> 27:11.200
As implied by this video, I find Greg Paul's rhetoric rather dishonest,

27:11.200 --> 27:13.680
but on top of that, I find it quite hawkish.

27:13.680 --> 27:15.280
It's one thing to defend your children,

27:15.280 --> 27:20.000
but it's another to then try to assassinate the characters of those who make these allegations.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.160
Gregory is preaching all this love while simultaneously making highly questionable

27:24.160 --> 27:26.160
and unsubstantiated claims against people,

27:26.160 --> 27:30.160
attacking their character with anecdotal evidence which given the additional context,

27:30.160 --> 27:31.280
seems rather doubtful.

27:31.280 --> 27:35.200
But even then, consistently dismissing his detractors on all fronts does not look good

27:35.200 --> 27:39.680
by any means, and most worryingly it creates an atmosphere in which no lessons are already learnt.

27:39.680 --> 27:42.240
The whole way to right your wrongs begins with accepting

27:42.240 --> 27:44.400
that you may have committed those wrongs here and there.

27:44.400 --> 27:46.240
All this little investigation has shown to me

27:46.240 --> 27:49.440
is that our mate Gregory here doesn't really wish to acknowledge that.

27:49.440 --> 27:52.480
In response to the Logan Paul scenario, the best he could say was

27:52.480 --> 27:55.200
we all make mistakes and appeal to Dr Phil.

27:55.200 --> 27:58.800
Which once again is not false, but is underplaying the circumstances.

27:58.800 --> 28:03.440
You also write a paragraph in the description about how they sometimes do stuff you disagree with.

28:03.440 --> 28:08.320
This is not a case of agreement or disagreement, and portraying it that way is very myopic.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.640
The thing is, in the context of modern society,

28:10.640 --> 28:13.440
many people have standards of how they should treat others.

28:13.440 --> 28:16.000
Everyone kind of differs a bit, but there is a baseline.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.840
Most of what has been discussed today is not a case of different strokes for different folks,

28:19.840 --> 28:22.240
it's about showing some respect to a fellow human being.

28:22.240 --> 28:25.600
The issue that Greg Paul creates is when he dismisses those who confront him,

28:25.600 --> 28:28.400
and being prepared to seemingly lie about these situations,

28:28.400 --> 28:30.880
that he cements himself as a constant scapegoat

28:30.880 --> 28:34.240
for whatever destructive actions Jake or Logan may commit.

28:34.240 --> 28:37.440
It enables them, knowing that they have that unconditional parachute,

28:37.440 --> 28:39.200
but sometimes they need to free fall.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.880
You don't have to publicly shit on them,

28:40.880 --> 28:44.240
but you just have to stop trying to make up these very transparent excuses

28:44.240 --> 28:46.480
for what is fairly deplorable behaviour.

28:46.480 --> 28:48.080
As I noted at the start of the video,

28:48.080 --> 28:51.120
Greg Paul had recently been called in and he was conducting an audit,

28:51.120 --> 28:54.160
and Nick Crompton leaving was a huge moment for the Ensembler,

28:54.160 --> 28:57.760
and the differences seem fairly obvious from the inception of this incident.

28:57.760 --> 28:59.200
However, very shortly after this,

28:59.200 --> 29:02.160
Team 10 put out a very bizarre statement on their twitter,

29:02.160 --> 29:06.160
which seemed to echo much of the attitude reflected in Greg Paul's behaviour,

29:06.160 --> 29:08.480
in a worrying totalitarian attitude.

29:08.480 --> 29:11.920
Notice the excessive and transparent use of the loyalty card,

29:11.920 --> 29:16.240
and this is something that Greg Paul clearly values himself above all other aspects.

29:16.240 --> 29:18.160
In his video over the Martinez twins,

29:18.160 --> 29:20.560
he lamented the fact that he was right about Max,

29:20.560 --> 29:22.000
another former Team 10 member.

29:38.480 --> 29:42.480
Despite the fact that Max left because he was uncomfortable with how the Pauls were presenting

29:42.480 --> 29:44.800
a possible assault case against FaZe Banks,

29:44.800 --> 29:46.960
one that seemed incredibly dishonest.

29:46.960 --> 29:49.360
Yet Greg Paul sees Max as a negative actor,

29:49.360 --> 29:54.000
despite the fact that Max's move was one of the most arguably moral in the history of Team 10.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.840
Greg saw it as a selfish action,

29:55.840 --> 29:58.960
how could he do that to people who gave him such an opportunity?

29:58.960 --> 30:01.920
That's because Gregory sees its influence as a collective,

30:01.920 --> 30:04.960
everything good that has come from Team 10 outweighs the bad,

30:05.040 --> 30:08.640
and from his perspective, if people stop trying to milk all these negative actions,

30:08.640 --> 30:12.720
then the collective could just carry on spreading this joy and this love.

30:12.720 --> 30:16.480
Through this love premise, Greg has always the loyalty card to maximum gain,

30:16.480 --> 30:21.040
telling us about how he knows all the people who have had their lives enhanced by Team 10,

30:21.040 --> 30:24.320
you are there for Team 10, you are subservient to Team 10.

30:24.320 --> 30:28.480
Also I thought it'd be interesting to note how the little text started much like the

30:28.480 --> 30:32.320
Instagram video, with that chunk of gratitude to the fans for their support,

30:32.320 --> 30:34.640
its contrivance almost nauseating.

30:34.640 --> 30:38.080
The aura that this statement gave off was much alike to a cult,

30:38.080 --> 30:41.440
if you are disloyal to what Team 10 represents then you are struck off,

30:41.440 --> 30:44.160
but that would premise that Team 10 is a positive force,

30:44.160 --> 30:47.200
which is a bit more up for debate than Greg presents it to be,

30:47.200 --> 30:51.040
he forgets that although Team 10 may have supposedly enhanced some people's lives,

30:51.040 --> 30:53.520
it could also have negatively affected others.

30:53.520 --> 30:57.840
The other factor that Greg doesn't seem to take into consideration is the alternate reality,

30:57.840 --> 31:02.720
where Team 10 doesn't exist, now it's here sure some people may have found purpose within it,

31:02.720 --> 31:07.440
but they may have found a different purpose in something more productive if Team 10 didn't exist,

31:07.440 --> 31:09.840
and it may not be beneficial for them long term.

31:09.840 --> 31:14.560
But Greg doesn't work on that level of reasoning, and therefore because Team 10 is so helpful,

31:14.560 --> 31:19.040
people should respect it regardless of what they do, the ends justify the means in his mind,

31:19.040 --> 31:22.400
but his idea of means are different to many of his critics,

31:22.400 --> 31:27.440
so it doesn't matter how allegedly rude or aggressive he is, it's for Team 10, it's for love.

31:27.440 --> 31:30.720
Judging from its language I think it's fair to assume that this little message

31:30.720 --> 31:35.040
had at least a bit of Greg sprinkled on it, and this takes me to my next point.

31:36.400 --> 31:42.160
Jake Paul made a video himself addressing the situation, in what was 20 minutes of unbelievable

31:42.160 --> 31:46.560
waffle that would put me on my most drunken terrain to shame, he stumbles through an explanation

31:46.560 --> 31:50.720
of how there's a future, and how he's planning for it, and how the people who left were afraid

31:50.720 --> 31:55.440
of his visions. Amongst the filler that was clearly done for the ad rev, I did find some

31:55.440 --> 31:59.840
statements of meaning, and I think they can tell something about the sorry situation that he finds

31:59.840 --> 32:03.920
himself in. Two parts stood out, the part in which he discusses his father, and the one that

32:03.920 --> 32:08.400
follows on from this. But what does he say about Greg specifically, well he said he needed someone

32:08.400 --> 32:13.520
to unconditionally fight his corner with the increasingly ambitious visions and ideas,

32:13.520 --> 32:18.560
he needed someone with more life experience to step in and help with possible individuals who

32:18.560 --> 32:23.760
might suck away that Jake Paul exuberance. And you know what, I'd probably do the same thing in his

32:23.760 --> 32:29.200
position, however the issue that this creates is a character evolution, because what Jake has in mind

32:29.200 --> 32:33.920
is more audacious, and likely more bombastic behaviour. One moment that I found distinctly

32:33.920 --> 32:38.640
symbolic was how he almost said he wanted to become the best person, before suddenly

32:38.640 --> 32:48.800
changing a qualifying statement to the best Jake Paul. The thing is that these two are distinctly

32:48.800 --> 32:53.440
different statements, and Jake realises that. I spoke about respect and decency earlier,

32:53.440 --> 32:58.160
and Jake needs someone to challenge that attitude rather than condoning it, especially if he doesn't

32:58.160 --> 33:02.320
want to burn out. There is no doubt that Jake will continue to be successful, and let's say

33:02.320 --> 33:07.200
Team 10 is a positive force, if it has brought joy to many people's lives then fair enough,

33:07.200 --> 33:12.160
we can always do better, and when people call out individuals like Jake for his destructive and

33:12.160 --> 33:16.480
reckless behaviour, whether Team 10 is a net positive is kinda regardless when it comes to

33:16.480 --> 33:21.520
these issues, if you can do better, why wouldn't you do better? Greg just doesn't accept this,

33:21.520 --> 33:26.320
and under the premise that Team 10 is a force for good, publicly dismisses, and attempts to smear

33:26.320 --> 33:30.320
other individuals in the name of that good cause, but most importantly not encouraging

33:30.320 --> 33:35.200
self reflection, not just within your family, but within fans, who for some reason then see you

33:35.200 --> 33:41.040
justifying actions and using the loyalty and false notion of positivity to blow off others as haters,

33:41.040 --> 33:45.440
while formulating your own plotlines. I'm sorry, but for someone with life experience,

33:45.440 --> 33:50.720
you should know better. What Greg Paul is up to in Team 10 I cannot be certain, it is not mine to

33:50.720 --> 33:54.720
prove, but although it may provide Jake with some business grounding, I can't see it being wholly

33:54.720 --> 33:58.640
beneficial for many other aspects. Jake Paul needs someone who is going to support him,

33:58.640 --> 34:02.720
but is also going to correct him, he's been in this world 21 years, and he needs the right

34:02.720 --> 34:08.720
guidance now he's actually trying to deal with life. Unfortunately, life is not one long vine

34:08.720 --> 34:12.960
clip. Equally as unfortunate, Greg does not seem the person to alleviate the problems that have

34:12.960 --> 34:17.040
been observed by multiple commentators, on the contrary his behaviour seems to lead to

34:17.040 --> 34:20.720
reinforcement which I personally believe will not lead to favourable outcomes.

34:20.720 --> 34:25.520
This brings me to my second point about Jake's video, the idea that it was best for Jake.

34:25.520 --> 34:30.000
The problem is that Greg is solely concerned with Jake, but what is best for Jake is not

34:30.000 --> 34:34.640
necessarily best for Team 10, and when you continuously cause people from Team 10 to leave,

34:34.640 --> 34:38.240
the people inside will inevitably become expendable and lose the draw that they gave

34:38.240 --> 34:42.160
to the squad, it becomes Jake Paul and his background answers, and it will inevitably

34:42.160 --> 34:47.120
lead people to question whether there even is a necessity for Team 10. So although people saying

34:47.120 --> 34:51.680
Team 10 is falling apart is an exaggeration, it does cause a possible loss of identity,

34:51.680 --> 34:55.600
the starting lineup established identity for themselves, the new ones appear to lack that,

34:55.600 --> 35:01.920
but either Greg Paul doesn't know or doesn't care. Once again, loyalty matters, but so does logic.

35:01.920 --> 35:05.840
It will inevitably become the Jake Paul show which if that's what you want then fair enough,

35:05.840 --> 35:10.640
but I don't want more Jake Paul in my life. The idea of Jake Paul having complete free reign

35:10.640 --> 35:14.560
is slightly concerning. Whether Jake Paul is conscious of this himself is a different

35:14.560 --> 35:18.240
question, but either way I do not see Greg benefiting Jake as an individual,

35:18.240 --> 35:23.200
nor Team 10 as a collective, I'm not saying it's going to happen soon, but if it does we know why.

35:23.200 --> 35:27.760
At the centre of the Paul family, we find a man who although may not be the image of the brand,

35:27.760 --> 35:32.720
is certainly exerting influence on a day to day basis, either over his sons, over an audience,

35:32.720 --> 35:37.920
or over others around him. Where that influence is positive as I present today is highly tentative,

35:37.920 --> 35:43.280
and the means that he uses to exert it is even more dubious. That man is Greg Paul.

35:44.160 --> 35:48.480
What do you think of the situation? What is exactly going on here? I would love to hear

35:48.480 --> 35:52.720
what you think. Leave your comments down below, I'm always interested to hear.

35:52.720 --> 35:56.560
You can also reach me on Twitter, at The Right Opinion, you can reach me on Facebook,

35:56.560 --> 36:00.880
I'll leave the links there, and you can also reach me on Discord too, I'll put my server in the link

36:00.880 --> 36:06.000
below. You can reach out to me through any of those mediums, I tend to respond to all of them,

36:06.000 --> 36:12.000
I do my best to be a responsive gentleman. Also, big shout out to the editors, they've once again

36:12.000 --> 36:17.280
done a stellar job, and I'm just imagining right now how this is going to look, and oh yes,

36:17.280 --> 36:23.280
that's very pleasing indeed. Also, big thanks to Wooly One, and RDBenji, whether invited or

36:23.280 --> 36:28.560
uninvited, I appreciate them nonetheless. Anyhow, love to hear your thoughts once again,

36:28.560 --> 36:32.720
until then however, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

36:42.000 --> 36:50.960
Thanks for watching!
