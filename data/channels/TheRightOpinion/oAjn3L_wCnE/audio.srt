00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,280
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

3
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,520
And today, we're gonna be reacting to Danielle Bregoli on Dr. Phil!

4
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what the fuck do you think you're doing here, Benji?

5
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,040
What on earth do you think you're doing? Shut up!

6
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,200
Well, dude, since you've been changing your content recently, I thought I would modernize it.

7
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,120
That's the word you use, right? Modernize?

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,560
Oh, look at me, I'm The Right Opinion, and this mutiny of my content creation hub is a travesty.

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,200
Hmm, let me publish a thesis on this catastrophe.

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,920
I love to use a prolific amount of big boy words because I'm insecure about my monocle.

11
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,320
You are not an invited guest. Goodbye.

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,400
This is a right opinion video, not a democracy.

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,880
And although topics have changed, I'll still be covering some more serious issues that you're familiar with.

14
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,840
Basically, I'll be doing what I find fun and somewhat original,

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,960
and I hope you guys in the Tro family will find it fun too.

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,800
But let's talk about family for a moment.

17
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
Whether that family is biological, adopted,

18
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,440
or just a group of people that you share a unique connection with,

19
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,760
they play a real role in shaping you as a person,

20
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,920
and can help you through some of your hardest times.

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,520
That should never be underrated.

22
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,360
But what if that family is Greg Paul?

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,280
Well, that's the scenario that Jake and Logan find themselves in.

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,280
It makes sense, he's their biological father, but he's not your normal dad of a YouTuber,

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,000
the one who stands, hopefully supportively, on the sidelines.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,160
He clearly enjoys basking in the spotlight,

27
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,960
and on principle there is nothing wrong with that time of the belief that

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,120
age should not constrain one's capacity,

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,120
and even if the doorway is via nepotism,

30
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,280
they may still have the character independent from the familial factor to redeem that.

31
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,320
The 54 year old is a character without a doubt,

32
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,960
but he clearly does want to involve himself in his son's lives,

33
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,240
and we'll touch on this later.

34
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,360
Jake and Logan Paul have established clout within their own rights,

35
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,920
but still appear to appreciate the presence of their father.

36
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,240
In one event, which I won't be discussing today,

37
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,160
Gregory here featured in one of Jake's videos,

38
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,360
and made out with a fan,

39
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,680
and although it's weird and marginally unsettling,

40
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,000
it's been ran into the ground by everyone under the sun,

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,400
and I think people have mostly made their mind up on it.

42
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,120
However, it is important that we provide some background for what inspired this video.

43
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,040
It was May, the Earth was rotating on its axis like any normal day,

44
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,040
but it wasn't any normal day for Team 10,

45
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,720
in fact it was quite an eventful period of time for Jake Paul and his comrades,

46
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,200
because on May the 5th, the COO of Team 10,

47
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,600
Nick Crompton, you know, the person who claimed that England was his city, stepped down.

48
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,480
Nick Crompton had been noted for his staunch devotion to Jake Paul,

49
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,360
and even in his divorce statement, he kept it relatively civil,

50
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,520
and urged people not to blindly hate on Jake.

51
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,800
However, an indirect recipient of the underlying message within the letter

52
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
seemed to be Mr. Gregory Paul himself.

53
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,640
It was also not long before Charles Sutton,

54
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,560
another highly distinguished member of the troop,

55
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,400
decided it was time for him to part ways,

56
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,000
and eventually, after a fair bit of digging, various hypotheses were stated.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,640
The main one being that Greg Paul, in question,

58
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,000
had assumed control of many of Jake's assets within the Team 10 business,

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,920
and had since been making some ruthless cut.

60
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,800
To put it quaintly, he had taken up the role of Team 10's own personal human resources department.

61
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,560
There were some elaborate stories,

62
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,200
some that included various details of possible merger,

63
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,440
and more individual developments that we'll discuss later,

64
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,120
but that is the core story that is mostly confirmed from both sides.

65
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,560
I follow this vaguely, and often it's something I would not rather touch on,

66
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,200
but I do believe there is a greater commentary that can be made out of

67
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,040
Greg Paul, his demeanour, and various relationships that this story encompasses.

68
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,920
Both Jake and Logan have their fair share of controversies,

69
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,320
Logan with the obvious, and Jake with the consistency,

70
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,120
and once again I stress that Jake and Logan can act how they want,

71
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,040
and the public will judge them as they do,

72
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,720
but if they want to be slightly more positive role models than the ones they're currently,

73
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,440
a mediating actor could be genuinely beneficial.

74
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,800
However, what I've found today,

75
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,400
tends to lend support to the fact that this could actually be rather detrimental.

76
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,280
No one's obliged to be great human beings,

77
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,080
however if you want to lecture people on what's right and what's wrong,

78
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,680
you better practice what you preach,

79
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,280
something that I find fundamentally lacking for all parties involved today.

80
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,720
I never do things lightweight here,

81
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,600
and although I'm leaning very heavily on the trending topic genre,

82
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,280
moreover than I ever have in the past,

83
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,520
do not expect any less of a serious analysis with various hypotheses integrated.

84
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,720
This is what we do here, on the right fucking opinion.

85
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,160
So, without further ado, let's get to it.

86
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:52,000
I think it's best to start an analysis with a bit of background.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,280
Greg Paul started up his Vine in light of Logan and Jake's success,

88
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,520
and although the Vine account doesn't appear to be up anymore,

89
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,200
I have found a compilation of clips that seem to reflect the sort of content that he made.

90
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,760
Given the fact that obviously his sons had Vine accounts too,

91
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,120
it's fairly easy to compare and contrast the sort of content that they produced.

92
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,200
Logan and Jake had a high energy style,

93
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,840
that whether you find funny or not, clearly had its appeal.

94
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,240
It was well produced, the punchlines were mostly on point,

95
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,800
and their choice of topics were diverse enough to have a novelty,

96
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,720
while similar enough to retain an audience.

97
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,960
Greg's content tended to revolve around a few things,

98
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,880
either captioning videos on the internet, interacting with his family, or yoga.

99
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,400
It's an interesting compilation.

100
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,240
Now, as intriguing as the yoga might be, I'm more interested in the second point there.

101
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,560
You see, through these, Greg Paul built his reputation as Logan and Jake Paul's dad.

102
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,760
Duh, I hear you say.

103
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,960
Well, that's who he is.

104
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,160
But it's not that simple.

105
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,280
For example, I assume most of the audience watching this video have parents,

106
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,560
but those parents don't go around branding themselves as your parents,

107
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,080
although it is factually true.

108
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,680
A significant proportion of Greg Paul's Vine and subsequent YouTube content

109
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,720
is dedicated to the misadventures with his two sons.

110
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,600
It makes sense, and I'm not saying it's a necessarily bad thing,

111
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,840
but it does set up premises for later statements.

112
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,000
It means that instead of really growing his own clout,

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,360
nearly all of his followers are confined within the Paul brothers circle.

114
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,800
This also means it makes a lot of interactions between the Paul family public,

115
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,520
which is okay again, considering Greg does seem to enjoy it.

116
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,120
But when dealing with certain levels of drama,

117
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,360
although it is family nature to defend the ones you love,

118
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,840
other times responding can just make you look worse,

119
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,240
and trying to justify unjustifiable actions

120
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,040
becomes much harder when you have journalistic attention.

121
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,720
Now, on the surface, a fair majority of his content is fairly harmless.

122
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,000
However, you can see how a mindset is created in most of his quote,

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,760
harmless content that follows into some of the more challenging videos of his,

124
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,920
particularly those surrounding drama.

125
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,440
So to get to the crux of the matter, we have to brush away at the surface first.

126
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,480
I think it's time to discuss the manufactured love.

127
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,240
Everyone needs a bit of love in their life,

128
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,520
but Greg Paul milks that simple fact until the cows come home.

129
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,880
It's kind of a meme, the more senior individuals within society

130
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,640
act slightly unnaturally online,

131
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,200
but Greg Paul seems to be a victim of that theory.

132
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,440
He bases his actions on the notion of love,

133
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,080
he's the sort of guy who would punch you in the name of love.

134
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,880
The haters knew how much love was out there and how much support was out there,

135
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,160
they'd shut their freaking mouths.

136
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,200
There's one video that kind of pushes this example,

137
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,920
it's the video in which Greg Paul confronts paparazzi.

138
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,720
Now, it would take someone very talented to make me feel sorry

139
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,440
for individuals who follow you around everywhere and take pictures,

140
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,840
and I'm not sure Greg Paul quite achieves that,

141
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,520
but I'll give him points for trying.

142
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,640
Being loud and obnoxious, being all in your face,

143
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,240
it's all for the love, my man.

144
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,200
Gotta have that love.

145
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,880
I've been talking about intentions a lot on this channel recently.

146
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,400
I said in my Nicole Arber video,

147
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,600
the good causes do not absolve terrible execution.

148
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,400
I do believe that many of these adults are quite aware of that,

149
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,280
they're not stupid.

150
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,040
I think Greg Paul's expression of this notion is excessively transparent,

151
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,200
but nonetheless, in spite of its contrivances,

152
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,040
some people still eat that shit up.

153
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,840
Despite the simple truth that if he'd done all the same things,

154
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,680
just out of anger or vitriol,

155
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,840
he wouldn't be given the same treatment.

156
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,280
Why is this?

157
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,200
Well, people like to justify their actions,

158
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,800
even when their actions may seem illogical to the individual in question.

159
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,040
Now, I have no doubt that there is a rationale behind the way that Greg Paul behaves,

160
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,880
but love is not that rationale.

161
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,760
Love is what he uses as a shield to deflect the idea

162
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,960
that sometimes he behaves in a less than socially aware manner.

163
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,440
This becomes increasingly transparent when you turn

164
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,320
to some of the more controversial statements that he put out.

165
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,200
My favorite video being the one he posted on his Instagram,

166
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,680
in response to the scrutiny Logan received,

167
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,240
many of it I'd argue justifiably so.

168
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,360
He made this statement.

169
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,560
Yo folks, what's happening?

170
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,760
GP coming at you.

171
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,560
Hey, a couple things I want to let everybody know that Logan is coming back.

172
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,360
That is definite.

173
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,080
A little bit of the bus update.

174
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,760
I put a new insulated floor in.

175
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,400
I've got some kitchen cabinets going in.

176
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,800
I've got a couple dressers I'm going to use for storage.

177
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,880
And it's coming along nice.

178
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,480
I'm having fun with this thing.

179
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,800
Also, the amount of love that has been coming has been unbelievable.

180
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,720
The amount of people showing support is unbelievable.

181
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
And I am now calling you guys super fans.

182
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,800
Because, you know, it's crazy.

183
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
As the haters think they're having an effect on us,

184
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,560
and if the haters knew how much love was out there

185
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,840
and how much support was out there,

186
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,200
they'd shut their freaking mouths.

187
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,520
The haters will never, ever have an effect on the Paul family

188
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,280
and the way that they want to make it happen,

189
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,640
because the love is too strong.

190
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,600
We all make mistakes.

191
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,760
Dr. Phil even said, hey, Logan's a good kid.

192
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,480
He's made a mistake.

193
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,520
He's 22 years old.

194
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,400
Push through it, get over it, and keep moving on.

195
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,520
Anyways, love you guys.

196
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,240
Love the support.

197
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,520
GP's out.

198
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,920
What Greg has done here is create a dichotomy from his earlier content,

199
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,600
where he preaches love and kindness.

200
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,280
And therefore, what he does here is equivocate his being to love.

201
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,800
And therefore, if you are opposed to the Pauls, you are thus opposed to love.

202
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,320
And on top of that, you're not just opposed to love, you are a hater.

203
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,640
There is no clarification on the sort of hate.

204
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,800
He doesn't qualify it with any statement.

205
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,880
It's just the haters won't get to him because he's got all this love inside of him.

206
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,240
Listen, there were clearly people who probably responded to Logan's actions

207
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,080
as irresponsible as they were in an irrational and disproportionate manner.

208
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,080
But Greg doesn't concern himself to clarify that he may be addressing a fringe group.

209
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,480
He's more interested in blanket statements and labels to give his fans that validation.

210
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,920
And even if he was addressing a fringe group, it would seem like a deflection anyway,

211
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,800
especially if you're not going to directly address it.

212
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,880
Also, general terminology, saying that people you claim to be haters would quote,

213
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,000
shut their freaking mouths if they knew about all the love you have, is a bit of a contradiction.

214
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,480
Greg always appeals to these basic emotional concepts as a way to distract from the fact

215
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,360
there is no real way to defend how people act sometimes.

216
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,360
But as long as he holds down that love sector, these people, they're just haters,

217
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,600
and he's got the love right here to hold them off.

218
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,640
So what was Greg referring to when he mentioned that transcendent concept of love that was just

219
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,600
out there?

220
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,200
Well, one of the other observations I made was how Greg likes to reflect

221
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,920
and discuss all the people that he and Jake have assisted.

222
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,160
And Logan, of course, I believe he uses this as mental justification in his own head

223
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,080
for the wrongdoings that may be committed.

224
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,680
I have had DMs with a lot of people talking about issues,

225
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,440
talking about them trying to commit suicide, and I've responded to a lot of people

226
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,640
said, hey, be strong, appreciate your writing, things like that.

227
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,120
I also noticed this on one of Jake's diss tracks,

228
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,240
in which he responds to criticism by talking about the great stuff he does.

229
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:30,400
If you fuck up and you accept you fuck up,

230
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,320
the best thing to do is remember that you have the capacity to do good with that influence

231
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,360
rather than attempting to retell all the times that you've done good

232
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,080
or noting it as some general love, because by doing that,

233
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,200
it immediately trivializes the actions that you have committed

234
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,960
and the motivations for committing them.

235
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,120
As the famous philosopher Cool Cat once said,

236
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,520
I'd also like to bring attention to what I call the loyalty card,

237
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,040
which isn't exactly the one you use in the supermache per se.

238
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,880
No, I mean the sort of one that's used by people

239
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,680
when they thank those for standing by them through the tough times.

240
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,400
In this instance, Greg Paul's use of the loyalty cards

241
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,480
upgrades the fans to super fans,

242
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,320
which of course means absolutely nothing to anyone above the age of 12,

243
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,800
but is a sort of emotional reward that may gratify

244
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,520
the sort of unconditional supporter of the Pauls.

245
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,640
It's always nice to experience appreciation from those we admire,

246
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,120
however most of us are at that age where we realize

247
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,400
the impersonality of YouTube celebrities saying it through the screen.

248
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,640
Basically, it probably doesn't mean much,

249
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,360
but if there's anything that the Paul fanbase has taught us,

250
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,240
is that people are still very easily influenced.

251
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,280
Now, the loyalty card isn't an intrinsically bad asset,

252
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,080
plenty of creators have it and use it on a regular basis,

253
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,280
it is natural in a way,

254
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,600
but when you abuse it to the level of Greg Paul,

255
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,000
the loyalty becomes a tool to override logic,

256
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,320
and I want you to hold on to this point for later.

257
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,240
It's been a while since I've had a guest on,

258
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,200
so I thought I'd mix it up and bring in my good friend Urbot,

259
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,400
also known as Wooly One,

260
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,840
and he did some research into Greg Paul's cyberbullying escapades.

261
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,880
Not sure what that is?

262
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,320
Well, you're in for a treat.

263
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,360
Take it away my friend.

264
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,880
Hello everyone, I'm Wooly One,

265
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,360
contributing-pologist on The Right Opinion's channel.

266
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,880
So Greg Paul, being a 54-year-old man,

267
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,520
has found it difficult to fit in on the internet.

268
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,880
From some of his videos, it's clear he simply does not understand

269
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,560
how basic things that YouTubers deal with every day work.

270
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,760
And it's not just through his somewhat cringey persona,

271
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,160
it's through the ideas that he has suggested.

272
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,520
The example we are going to look at today is cyberbullying.

273
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,400
Now, cyberbullying is a very new form of harassment

274
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,200
because it takes place on a very new medium, the internet.

275
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,600
It's also an incredibly easy form of harassment

276
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,360
because you can get the satisfaction of speaking your mind about another person

277
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,600
without having to see their reaction live.

278
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,520
Louis CK, you know, the comedian, the guy who,

279
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,240
yeah, he put it best in an interview with Conan O'Brien.

280
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,960
So kids are mean and it's because they're trying it out.

281
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,520
They look at a kid and they go,

282
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,640
you're fat, and then they see the kid's face scrunch up and they go,

283
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,120
ooh, that doesn't feel good to make a person do that.

284
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,680
But they got to start with doing the mean thing.

285
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,800
Because these insults are bytes and data

286
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,160
seemingly posted by one person and received by another,

287
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,360
Greg Paul thinks this issue can easily be solved.

288
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,520
About a year ago, Greg Paul posted a very interesting video titled,

289
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,760
Cyberbullying is real! My thoughts on everything Logan and Jake Paul.

290
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,440
Hashtag the second verse.

291
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,480
He starts off by addressing some of the hot rumors at the time,

292
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,400
particularly the Alyssa Violet situation, which James will touch on later.

293
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,680
He makes a really weird point about perception versus reality,

294
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,040
where he calls out Jake and Logan's own pranks by name,

295
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,200
and he tells you that they were staged.

296
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,240
Just remember, a lot of the same people coming at me

297
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,800
really believed Jake was in the White House.

298
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,440
They really believed Dwarf Mamba was shipped in an airplane.

299
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,880
None of it was true.

300
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,680
But then he tries to connect it back to the truth

301
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,360
and how the viewers perceive the truth.

302
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,400
And a lot of it is somebody's perception of how they saw things.

303
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,600
He basically leaves you with the impression that it was the viewers' fault

304
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,240
that they didn't understand that the pranks were staged.

305
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,840
And in a similar way, they don't understand the Alyssa Violet situation.

306
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,760
It's a very loose connection that doesn't really seem to help his case.

307
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,240
After all, if Jake and Logan Paul wanted their viewers to get the right idea about their content,

308
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,920
why don't they just not lie to them?

309
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,800
About five minutes in though, he switches gears.

310
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,000
You see, in his coverage of this Alyssa Violet situation, he's received a great deal of hate.

311
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,120
Now, most YouTubers would probably just block and ignore them.

312
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,440
But Greg Paul has a different idea.

313
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,240
Instead, he proposes a cyberbullying database

314
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,720
where people are named and branded as cyberbullies.

315
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:08,720
And this database can be accessed by, well, pretty much anyone.

316
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,480
Parents, teachers, employers, significant others, and yes, the police.

317
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,600
If this idea sounds extremely Orwellian and horrible,

318
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,560
you're thinking at least a little more rationally than Greg here.

319
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,200
There are so many problems with a database of this nature that become immediately apparent.

320
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,160
For example, that most threats are made anonymously,

321
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,960
and without an extremely invasive police investigation,

322
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:34,320
the only identification people would have access to would be their general location, if that at all.

323
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,200
But let's assume, as Greg does, that one would be able to easily log this information.

324
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,560
He still essentially wants a nine-year-old telling you to KYS

325
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,120
to be treated with the same severity and seriousness

326
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,600
as a 60-year-old homeless man whipping his dick out in front of preschoolers on a playground.

327
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,240
Even to most of the technologically inept,

328
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,880
this sounds incredibly stupid and ineffective.

329
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,440
Not to mention how easy it would be to fake the evidence with Inspect Element or Photoshop,

330
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,840
two things that Greg probably hasn't even heard of.

331
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,960
It just wouldn't work.

332
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,680
And while Greg may be a seasoned human being,

333
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,320
he's not a seasoned YouTuber, so he just doesn't get it.

334
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,080
Well, fast forward a year and prepubescent YouTube commenters with anime profile pictures

335
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,800
have not been rounded up and shot into mass graves yet.

336
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,400
So what happened?

337
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,600
Well, nothing, I guess.

338
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,360
For a few months after his video, he continued talking on Instagram

339
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,520
about how he was definitely going to create this database and how he was going to do it right.

340
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,080
Like his video, he also mentioned working with the LAPD to get it off the ground.

341
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,440
And each time, he promised to do away with these vile cyberbullies

342
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,560
who'd been sending hate to him, but it just never happened.

343
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,760
There still is no database, and I doubt there ever will be.

344
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,320
Why?

345
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,520
Well, maybe he realized how much of an idiotic concept this was

346
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,080
from the numerous comments and dislikes on the video.

347
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,440
Or maybe he never had any intention of creating such a database

348
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,280
and only conceived of it as a threat to freak out those who were insulting him.

349
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,520
Perhaps he was just doing it to make himself look better,

350
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,240
especially considering he was in a video about an already highly controversial topic,

351
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,240
using it as yet another means to shove his love down your throat and evade criticism.

352
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,720
I think that one of the conclusions that can be drawn from the Greg Paul cyberbullying saga

353
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,080
is that the man himself seems deeply concerned about others when something happens to him.

354
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,280
Now, what do I mean by this?

355
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,000
Well, in the video, he states constantly about how he doesn't care about all the hate he's received.

356
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,500
Guess what?

357
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,160
I don't care what you call me.

358
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,640
Doesn't matter.

359
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,040
The fact that you're calling me a faggot and you think it's offensive?

360
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,360
Where are you?

361
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,200
Are you living in 1952?

362
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,880
This is 2017.

363
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,960
If you got an issue with somebody in their sexual orientation, that's too bad for you.

364
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,920
Those aren't my issues.

365
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,840
The fact that you're calling me old and bald?

366
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,560
I don't really care.

367
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,000
Uh, a lot of you guys said you know why Pam and I got divorced?

368
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,880
Listen, 50% of the couples out there get divorced.

369
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,560
The 50% that are married, another 25% want to get divorced.

370
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,120
So trying to slam me because I got divorced doesn't bother me.

371
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,560
It has no value.

372
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,320
It's all water off the duck's back for him.

373
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,640
He's so resolute that you can call him a faggot.

374
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,560
And if you're not down with the gays in 2017, well, that's your problem.

375
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,560
However, Greg Paul is so concerned that it might happen to someone else

376
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,960
that isn't as strong and resolute as him

377
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,840
that he wants to set up this database that takes down everyone who says something mean.

378
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,680
All you folks that sent me the hate mail,

379
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,920
I think you're going to be the first ones that I expose

380
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,880
and let the general public know that you guys are out there trying to be bullies.

381
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,160
And listen, there's nothing wrong with looking out for other people.

382
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,880
But when you suddenly start caring about something for the sole reason of it happening to you,

383
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,520
saying that you don't care about the fact that it happens to you seems fairly hard to believe.

384
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,880
And it seems like a real attempt to switch the fact that he's upset about what someone did to him

385
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,160
as a way to simultaneously look better, like a crusader against all those bad, nasty bullies.

386
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,240
But this is just indicative of how Greg Paul really tries to find

387
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,000
anything that's happened to him as a way to pole vault himself into relevancy.

388
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,920
He needs the spotlight to be on him.

389
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,480
So by seizing the opportunity to do something revolutionary in his head,

390
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,480
it would give him that attention, even when his reaction, as I showed earlier,

391
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,800
is completely irrational and symptomatic of his technological naivety.

392
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,320
Anyway, back to you, Jimbo.

393
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,280
As noted earlier, this was part of a greater video on the Alyssa Violet situation,

394
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,040
in which she left the Team 10 house.

395
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:24,240
Both Jake and Alyssa told very contrasting stories about what exactly happened within the premises.

396
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,280
But Greg Paul then decided to join in and tell his own story,

397
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,120
which is interesting to say the least.

398
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,160
In this story, he declared that Alyssa wasn't kicked out for cheating,

399
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,840
as Jake claimed, or anything else, but she was removed for not paying rent.

400
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,440
Alyssa wasn't kicked out of the house.

401
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,160
She was asked to leave because she wasn't paying rent.

402
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,920
And at the center of this bizarre story is the father, Mr. Greg Paul himself,

403
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,680
who in spite of barely turning up in either of the other members' testaments,

404
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,120
apart from a cameo in Alyssa's where she claimed he verbally abused her in public.

405
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,720
He had a leading role in his story.

406
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,560
In this retelling, Alyssa Violet was belligerently remaining in the Team 10 house,

407
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,920
and she would not budge.

408
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,760
Greg Paul, the gracious, cogent gentleman, sat down with her,

409
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,520
and gave her some top-notch advice on that Greg Paul, the man himself,

410
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,240
managed to bring her time at Team 10 to an end.

411
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,720
In case you've noticed an undertone of sarcasm in my voice,

412
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,120
it's because I am being fucking sarcastic.

413
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,160
And frankly, this is some of the thickest bullshit that I've heard in a while.

414
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,760
Warning! Warning! Bullshit alert!

415
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,600
Greg Paul claims that a lot of Alyssa Violet's allegations cannot be backed up,

416
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,760
before making a number of unsubstantiated claims himself and just saying,

417
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,960
well it's the truth.

418
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,520
She did miss auditions because of not being able to wake up and make it on time.

419
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,560
These things are all the truth. These things actually happen.

420
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,680
I also find it amusing that he has to interject multiple times in the video

421
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,840
to remind the viewer that he is telling the truth,

422
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,560
and reminds us all that everyone in Team 10 likes him,

423
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,400
because he's hard working for those people.

424
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,800
I'm not saying that he's not, but the self-validation is pretty suspicious.

425
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,480
To prove his moral worth, he says that his level of truth is so strong

426
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,240
that there are lawyers who have offered to take his case for free against Alyssa Violet,

427
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,360
but he's not going to do that because he's above all the petty drama,

428
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,280
he's above the lying and the hatred.

429
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,720
He's so moral, don't we all wish we could be like Gregory here?

430
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,920
Not quite, right?

431
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,080
This tells me two things.

432
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,120
Firstly, that Greg Paul is a pretty bad liar.

433
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,720
There are multiple cues for lying,

434
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,400
most notably the disturbing amount of times he licks his lips in that video.

435
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:24,080
Which in comparison to his other videos is quite disproportionate,

436
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,080
but who cares, maybe it was a hot day,

437
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,080
Greg's lips have just been so dry in need of that constant moisturising.

438
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,840
Maybe a boy just thirsty.

439
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,760
After all, the biggest indicator that he's chatting shit

440
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,800
is the story doesn't even match the one told by his son Jakey here.

441
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,920
Jake claimed that Alyssa cheated on him, but maybe he was wrong too,

442
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,600
maybe Greg is actually Thanos,

443
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,120
and is using the reality stone to manipulate the world that Team 10 lives in.

444
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,240
It's still more plausible than any of the stories that Greg is actually telling.

445
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,120
Greg also has this perfect way of twisting what people say.

446
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,880
He states that Alyssa saying that she thought he was going to pull a gun out was unfair,

447
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,640
which as a point, a standalone point, I guess, stands,

448
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,080
but then goes on to say this.

449
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,720
Which given the additional context is a blatantly dishonest way of framing it,

450
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,960
and anyone who understands basic rhetorical devices knows exactly what she's implying.

451
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,280
And I think you do too, Greg.

452
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,160
All I'm saying is you're not making a good case for yourself here, buddy.

453
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,360
In fact, in another video where he once again truthfully recollects

454
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,840
a story of the Martinez twins and their departure,

455
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,680
he drops the disclaimer that he often makes very little eye contact with the camera,

456
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,880
and that is normal behaviour, so don't try and investigate him for lying.

457
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,280
After all, if you act like a liar all the time, people can't specifically call out the lies,

458
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,520
although the licking lips are pretty excessive.

459
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,120
Tasty.

460
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,600
What I've found from all these videos is that Greg likes to insert himself into these situations,

461
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,520
and be as intimate to the drama as possible.

462
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,560
He takes credit for the savage shirt that the Martinez twins wear,

463
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,400
says that they were referring to him as a dad,

464
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,440
and wanted him to be their manager before this other manager came in and disrupted the whole situation.

465
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:29,200
Every story involves him, despite many of the anecdotes

466
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,400
from other individuals within the Team 10 house seldom including him.

467
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,560
The details that Greg provides would lead you to believe that

468
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,680
he's actually a member of Team 10, let alone involved in it.

469
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,760
Why this level of involvement though?

470
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,440
Well, one reason appears pretty obvious, that it's good for views and interaction,

471
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,480
and people always want to hear the hottest takes from those in the know,

472
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,640
and Greg Paul is definitely in the know, he's just not entirely in the tell.

473
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,720
The other idea is that he likes to see himself as involved in his children's lives,

474
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,360
which isn't a completely unreasonable explanation either,

475
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,360
as I said at the start, he brands himself as the father to these two icons,

476
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,400
above all other representations of his character, and his content plays into this narrative.

477
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,920
But I want to reintroduce a couple of points that I mentioned briefly earlier.

478
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,480
A lot of the issue that the Paul family tends to culminate

479
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,880
is that their interactions are out in the public eye,

480
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,120
and that's not a huge issue as principle,

481
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,600
but as families we are more likely to defend each other,

482
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,360
because we believe we know the character of the individual better than the criticism

483
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,480
from the outsiders, and these people are intimate to our lives,

484
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,200
we don't want conflict by publicly shouting them down,

485
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,440
and frankly, I wouldn't expect Greg Paul to go around publicly lambasting his children,

486
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,400
and if you want to defend them, then that's not necessarily a bad thing either,

487
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,480
but there comes a point where defending an individual not just comes at a detriment to you,

488
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,040
but to them and other individuals around them.

489
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,320
If there's one thing that Jake and Logan's behaviour has taught us,

490
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,760
is that they are really in desperate need of some real world experience.

491
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,720
They're hardly children, but you'd be hard pressed to find behaviour

492
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,560
that matches their respective maturity,

493
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,360
whether it's obnoxiousness or just plain insensitivity,

494
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,200
they seem to have all the boxes ticked.

495
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,200
Much of their behaviour seems to lean onto the fact they don't recognise the implications

496
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,200
that their actions have on those around them.

497
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,200
As implied by this video, I find Greg Paul's rhetoric rather dishonest,

498
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,680
but on top of that, I find it quite hawkish.

499
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,280
It's one thing to defend your children,

500
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:20,000
but it's another to then try to assassinate the characters of those who make these allegations.

501
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,160
Gregory is preaching all this love while simultaneously making highly questionable

502
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,160
and unsubstantiated claims against people,

503
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,160
attacking their character with anecdotal evidence which given the additional context,

504
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,280
seems rather doubtful.

505
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,200
But even then, consistently dismissing his detractors on all fronts does not look good

506
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,680
by any means, and most worryingly it creates an atmosphere in which no lessons are already learnt.

507
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,240
The whole way to right your wrongs begins with accepting

508
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,400
that you may have committed those wrongs here and there.

509
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,240
All this little investigation has shown to me

510
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,440
is that our mate Gregory here doesn't really wish to acknowledge that.

511
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,480
In response to the Logan Paul scenario, the best he could say was

512
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,200
we all make mistakes and appeal to Dr Phil.

513
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,800
Which once again is not false, but is underplaying the circumstances.

514
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,440
You also write a paragraph in the description about how they sometimes do stuff you disagree with.

515
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,320
This is not a case of agreement or disagreement, and portraying it that way is very myopic.

516
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,640
The thing is, in the context of modern society,

517
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,440
many people have standards of how they should treat others.

518
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,000
Everyone kind of differs a bit, but there is a baseline.

519
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,840
Most of what has been discussed today is not a case of different strokes for different folks,

520
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,240
it's about showing some respect to a fellow human being.

521
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,600
The issue that Greg Paul creates is when he dismisses those who confront him,

522
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,400
and being prepared to seemingly lie about these situations,

523
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,880
that he cements himself as a constant scapegoat

524
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,240
for whatever destructive actions Jake or Logan may commit.

525
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,440
It enables them, knowing that they have that unconditional parachute,

526
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,200
but sometimes they need to free fall.

527
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,880
You don't have to publicly shit on them,

528
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,240
but you just have to stop trying to make up these very transparent excuses

529
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,480
for what is fairly deplorable behaviour.

530
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,080
As I noted at the start of the video,

531
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,120
Greg Paul had recently been called in and he was conducting an audit,

532
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,160
and Nick Crompton leaving was a huge moment for the Ensembler,

533
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,760
and the differences seem fairly obvious from the inception of this incident.

534
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,200
However, very shortly after this,

535
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,160
Team 10 put out a very bizarre statement on their twitter,

536
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:06,160
which seemed to echo much of the attitude reflected in Greg Paul's behaviour,

537
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,480
in a worrying totalitarian attitude.

538
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,920
Notice the excessive and transparent use of the loyalty card,

539
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:16,240
and this is something that Greg Paul clearly values himself above all other aspects.

540
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,160
In his video over the Martinez twins,

541
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,560
he lamented the fact that he was right about Max,

542
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,000
another former Team 10 member.

543
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,480
Despite the fact that Max left because he was uncomfortable with how the Pauls were presenting

544
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,800
a possible assault case against FaZe Banks,

545
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,960
one that seemed incredibly dishonest.

546
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,360
Yet Greg Paul sees Max as a negative actor,

547
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,000
despite the fact that Max's move was one of the most arguably moral in the history of Team 10.

548
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,840
Greg saw it as a selfish action,

549
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,960
how could he do that to people who gave him such an opportunity?

550
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,920
That's because Gregory sees its influence as a collective,

551
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,960
everything good that has come from Team 10 outweighs the bad,

552
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,640
and from his perspective, if people stop trying to milk all these negative actions,

553
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,720
then the collective could just carry on spreading this joy and this love.

554
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,480
Through this love premise, Greg has always the loyalty card to maximum gain,

555
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,040
telling us about how he knows all the people who have had their lives enhanced by Team 10,

556
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,320
you are there for Team 10, you are subservient to Team 10.

557
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,480
Also I thought it'd be interesting to note how the little text started much like the

558
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,320
Instagram video, with that chunk of gratitude to the fans for their support,

559
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,640
its contrivance almost nauseating.

560
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,080
The aura that this statement gave off was much alike to a cult,

561
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,440
if you are disloyal to what Team 10 represents then you are struck off,

562
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,160
but that would premise that Team 10 is a positive force,

563
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,200
which is a bit more up for debate than Greg presents it to be,

564
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,040
he forgets that although Team 10 may have supposedly enhanced some people's lives,

565
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,520
it could also have negatively affected others.

566
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,840
The other factor that Greg doesn't seem to take into consideration is the alternate reality,

567
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,720
where Team 10 doesn't exist, now it's here sure some people may have found purpose within it,

568
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,440
but they may have found a different purpose in something more productive if Team 10 didn't exist,

569
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,840
and it may not be beneficial for them long term.

570
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,560
But Greg doesn't work on that level of reasoning, and therefore because Team 10 is so helpful,

571
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:19,040
people should respect it regardless of what they do, the ends justify the means in his mind,

572
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,400
but his idea of means are different to many of his critics,

573
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:27,440
so it doesn't matter how allegedly rude or aggressive he is, it's for Team 10, it's for love.

574
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,720
Judging from its language I think it's fair to assume that this little message

575
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,040
had at least a bit of Greg sprinkled on it, and this takes me to my next point.

576
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:42,160
Jake Paul made a video himself addressing the situation, in what was 20 minutes of unbelievable

577
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,560
waffle that would put me on my most drunken terrain to shame, he stumbles through an explanation

578
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,720
of how there's a future, and how he's planning for it, and how the people who left were afraid

579
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,440
of his visions. Amongst the filler that was clearly done for the ad rev, I did find some

580
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,840
statements of meaning, and I think they can tell something about the sorry situation that he finds

581
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,920
himself in. Two parts stood out, the part in which he discusses his father, and the one that

582
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,400
follows on from this. But what does he say about Greg specifically, well he said he needed someone

583
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,520
to unconditionally fight his corner with the increasingly ambitious visions and ideas,

584
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:18,560
he needed someone with more life experience to step in and help with possible individuals who

585
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:23,760
might suck away that Jake Paul exuberance. And you know what, I'd probably do the same thing in his

586
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:29,200
position, however the issue that this creates is a character evolution, because what Jake has in mind

587
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,920
is more audacious, and likely more bombastic behaviour. One moment that I found distinctly

588
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:38,640
symbolic was how he almost said he wanted to become the best person, before suddenly

589
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:48,800
changing a qualifying statement to the best Jake Paul. The thing is that these two are distinctly

590
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:53,440
different statements, and Jake realises that. I spoke about respect and decency earlier,

591
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,160
and Jake needs someone to challenge that attitude rather than condoning it, especially if he doesn't

592
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,320
want to burn out. There is no doubt that Jake will continue to be successful, and let's say

593
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:07,200
Team 10 is a positive force, if it has brought joy to many people's lives then fair enough,

594
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,160
we can always do better, and when people call out individuals like Jake for his destructive and

595
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:16,480
reckless behaviour, whether Team 10 is a net positive is kinda regardless when it comes to

596
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,520
these issues, if you can do better, why wouldn't you do better? Greg just doesn't accept this,

597
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:26,320
and under the premise that Team 10 is a force for good, publicly dismisses, and attempts to smear

598
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,320
other individuals in the name of that good cause, but most importantly not encouraging

599
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,200
self reflection, not just within your family, but within fans, who for some reason then see you

600
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,040
justifying actions and using the loyalty and false notion of positivity to blow off others as haters,

601
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:45,440
while formulating your own plotlines. I'm sorry, but for someone with life experience,

602
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,720
you should know better. What Greg Paul is up to in Team 10 I cannot be certain, it is not mine to

603
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,720
prove, but although it may provide Jake with some business grounding, I can't see it being wholly

604
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,640
beneficial for many other aspects. Jake Paul needs someone who is going to support him,

605
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,720
but is also going to correct him, he's been in this world 21 years, and he needs the right

606
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:08,720
guidance now he's actually trying to deal with life. Unfortunately, life is not one long vine

607
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,960
clip. Equally as unfortunate, Greg does not seem the person to alleviate the problems that have

608
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,040
been observed by multiple commentators, on the contrary his behaviour seems to lead to

609
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,720
reinforcement which I personally believe will not lead to favourable outcomes.

610
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,520
This brings me to my second point about Jake's video, the idea that it was best for Jake.

611
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,000
The problem is that Greg is solely concerned with Jake, but what is best for Jake is not

612
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,640
necessarily best for Team 10, and when you continuously cause people from Team 10 to leave,

613
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:38,240
the people inside will inevitably become expendable and lose the draw that they gave

614
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,160
to the squad, it becomes Jake Paul and his background answers, and it will inevitably

615
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:47,120
lead people to question whether there even is a necessity for Team 10. So although people saying

616
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,680
Team 10 is falling apart is an exaggeration, it does cause a possible loss of identity,

617
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,600
the starting lineup established identity for themselves, the new ones appear to lack that,

618
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:01,920
but either Greg Paul doesn't know or doesn't care. Once again, loyalty matters, but so does logic.

619
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,840
It will inevitably become the Jake Paul show which if that's what you want then fair enough,

620
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:10,640
but I don't want more Jake Paul in my life. The idea of Jake Paul having complete free reign

621
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,560
is slightly concerning. Whether Jake Paul is conscious of this himself is a different

622
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,240
question, but either way I do not see Greg benefiting Jake as an individual,

623
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,200
nor Team 10 as a collective, I'm not saying it's going to happen soon, but if it does we know why.

624
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,760
At the centre of the Paul family, we find a man who although may not be the image of the brand,

625
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,720
is certainly exerting influence on a day to day basis, either over his sons, over an audience,

626
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,920
or over others around him. Where that influence is positive as I present today is highly tentative,

627
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,280
and the means that he uses to exert it is even more dubious. That man is Greg Paul.

628
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,480
What do you think of the situation? What is exactly going on here? I would love to hear

629
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,720
what you think. Leave your comments down below, I'm always interested to hear.

630
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,560
You can also reach me on Twitter, at The Right Opinion, you can reach me on Facebook,

631
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,880
I'll leave the links there, and you can also reach me on Discord too, I'll put my server in the link

632
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,000
below. You can reach out to me through any of those mediums, I tend to respond to all of them,

633
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I do my best to be a responsive gentleman. Also, big shout out to the editors, they've once again

634
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,280
done a stellar job, and I'm just imagining right now how this is going to look, and oh yes,

635
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,280
that's very pleasing indeed. Also, big thanks to Wooly One, and RDBenji, whether invited or

636
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,560
uninvited, I appreciate them nonetheless. Anyhow, love to hear your thoughts once again,

637
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,720
until then however, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

638
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:50,960
Thanks for watching!
