28080	33280	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
33280	37520	And today, we're gonna be reacting to Danielle Bregoli on Dr. Phil!
37520	41360	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what the fuck do you think you're doing here, Benji?
41360	43040	What on earth do you think you're doing? Shut up!
43040	47200	Well, dude, since you've been changing your content recently, I thought I would modernize it.
47200	49120	That's the word you use, right? Modernize?
49120	54560	Oh, look at me, I'm The Right Opinion, and this mutiny of my content creation hub is a travesty.
54560	57200	Hmm, let me publish a thesis on this catastrophe.
57200	61920	I love to use a prolific amount of big boy words because I'm insecure about my monocle.
61920	64320	You are not an invited guest. Goodbye.
65280	68400	This is a right opinion video, not a democracy.
68400	72880	And although topics have changed, I'll still be covering some more serious issues that you're familiar with.
72880	75840	Basically, I'll be doing what I find fun and somewhat original,
75840	78960	and I hope you guys in the Tro family will find it fun too.
78960	80800	But let's talk about family for a moment.
80800	82800	Whether that family is biological, adopted,
82800	85440	or just a group of people that you share a unique connection with,
85440	87760	they play a real role in shaping you as a person,
87760	89920	and can help you through some of your hardest times.
89920	91520	That should never be underrated.
91520	93360	But what if that family is Greg Paul?
94080	97280	Well, that's the scenario that Jake and Logan find themselves in.
97280	101280	It makes sense, he's their biological father, but he's not your normal dad of a YouTuber,
101280	104000	the one who stands, hopefully supportively, on the sidelines.
104000	106160	He clearly enjoys basking in the spotlight,
106160	108960	and on principle there is nothing wrong with that time of the belief that
108960	111120	age should not constrain one's capacity,
111120	113120	and even if the doorway is via nepotism,
113120	117280	they may still have the character independent from the familial factor to redeem that.
117280	120320	The 54 year old is a character without a doubt,
120320	122960	but he clearly does want to involve himself in his son's lives,
122960	124240	and we'll touch on this later.
124240	127360	Jake and Logan Paul have established clout within their own rights,
127360	129920	but still appear to appreciate the presence of their father.
129920	132240	In one event, which I won't be discussing today,
132240	134160	Gregory here featured in one of Jake's videos,
134160	135360	and made out with a fan,
135360	137680	and although it's weird and marginally unsettling,
137680	140000	it's been ran into the ground by everyone under the sun,
140000	142400	and I think people have mostly made their mind up on it.
143440	147120	However, it is important that we provide some background for what inspired this video.
147120	151040	It was May, the Earth was rotating on its axis like any normal day,
151040	153040	but it wasn't any normal day for Team 10,
153040	156720	in fact it was quite an eventful period of time for Jake Paul and his comrades,
156720	159200	because on May the 5th, the COO of Team 10,
159200	163600	Nick Crompton, you know, the person who claimed that England was his city, stepped down.
163600	166480	Nick Crompton had been noted for his staunch devotion to Jake Paul,
166480	169360	and even in his divorce statement, he kept it relatively civil,
169360	171520	and urged people not to blindly hate on Jake.
171520	174800	However, an indirect recipient of the underlying message within the letter
174800	176800	seemed to be Mr. Gregory Paul himself.
176800	178640	It was also not long before Charles Sutton,
178640	180560	another highly distinguished member of the troop,
180560	182400	decided it was time for him to part ways,
182400	186000	and eventually, after a fair bit of digging, various hypotheses were stated.
186000	188640	The main one being that Greg Paul, in question,
188640	192000	had assumed control of many of Jake's assets within the Team 10 business,
192000	193920	and had since been making some ruthless cut.
193920	198800	To put it quaintly, he had taken up the role of Team 10's own personal human resources department.
198800	200560	There were some elaborate stories,
200560	203200	some that included various details of possible merger,
203200	205440	and more individual developments that we'll discuss later,
205440	209120	but that is the core story that is mostly confirmed from both sides.
209120	212560	I follow this vaguely, and often it's something I would not rather touch on,
212560	215200	but I do believe there is a greater commentary that can be made out of
215200	219040	Greg Paul, his demeanour, and various relationships that this story encompasses.
219040	221920	Both Jake and Logan have their fair share of controversies,
221920	224320	Logan with the obvious, and Jake with the consistency,
224320	227120	and once again I stress that Jake and Logan can act how they want,
227120	229040	and the public will judge them as they do,
229040	232720	but if they want to be slightly more positive role models than the ones they're currently,
232720	235440	a mediating actor could be genuinely beneficial.
235440	236800	However, what I've found today,
236800	240400	tends to lend support to the fact that this could actually be rather detrimental.
241280	243280	No one's obliged to be great human beings,
243280	246080	however if you want to lecture people on what's right and what's wrong,
246080	247680	you better practice what you preach,
247680	251280	something that I find fundamentally lacking for all parties involved today.
251280	252720	I never do things lightweight here,
252720	255600	and although I'm leaning very heavily on the trending topic genre,
255600	257280	moreover than I ever have in the past,
257280	261520	do not expect any less of a serious analysis with various hypotheses integrated.
261520	264720	This is what we do here, on the right fucking opinion.
266880	270160	So, without further ado, let's get to it.
281360	292000	I think it's best to start an analysis with a bit of background.
292000	295280	Greg Paul started up his Vine in light of Logan and Jake's success,
295280	297520	and although the Vine account doesn't appear to be up anymore,
297520	301200	I have found a compilation of clips that seem to reflect the sort of content that he made.
301200	303760	Given the fact that obviously his sons had Vine accounts too,
303760	307120	it's fairly easy to compare and contrast the sort of content that they produced.
307120	309200	Logan and Jake had a high energy style,
309200	311840	that whether you find funny or not, clearly had its appeal.
311840	314240	It was well produced, the punchlines were mostly on point,
314240	316800	and their choice of topics were diverse enough to have a novelty,
316800	318720	while similar enough to retain an audience.
318720	320960	Greg's content tended to revolve around a few things,
320960	324880	either captioning videos on the internet, interacting with his family, or yoga.
324880	326400	It's an interesting compilation.
326400	330240	Now, as intriguing as the yoga might be, I'm more interested in the second point there.
330240	334560	You see, through these, Greg Paul built his reputation as Logan and Jake Paul's dad.
334560	335760	Duh, I hear you say.
335760	336960	Well, that's who he is.
336960	338160	But it's not that simple.
338160	341280	For example, I assume most of the audience watching this video have parents,
341280	344560	but those parents don't go around branding themselves as your parents,
344560	346080	although it is factually true.
346080	349680	A significant proportion of Greg Paul's Vine and subsequent YouTube content
349680	352720	is dedicated to the misadventures with his two sons.
352720	355600	It makes sense, and I'm not saying it's a necessarily bad thing,
355600	357840	but it does set up premises for later statements.
357840	360000	It means that instead of really growing his own clout,
360000	363360	nearly all of his followers are confined within the Paul brothers circle.
363360	366800	This also means it makes a lot of interactions between the Paul family public,
366800	369520	which is okay again, considering Greg does seem to enjoy it.
369520	371120	But when dealing with certain levels of drama,
371120	373360	although it is family nature to defend the ones you love,
373360	375840	other times responding can just make you look worse,
375840	378240	and trying to justify unjustifiable actions
378240	381040	becomes much harder when you have journalistic attention.
381040	384720	Now, on the surface, a fair majority of his content is fairly harmless.
384720	388000	However, you can see how a mindset is created in most of his quote,
388000	391760	harmless content that follows into some of the more challenging videos of his,
391760	393920	particularly those surrounding drama.
393920	397440	So to get to the crux of the matter, we have to brush away at the surface first.
397440	400480	I think it's time to discuss the manufactured love.
400480	402240	Everyone needs a bit of love in their life,
402240	405520	but Greg Paul milks that simple fact until the cows come home.
405520	408880	It's kind of a meme, the more senior individuals within society
408880	410640	act slightly unnaturally online,
410640	413200	but Greg Paul seems to be a victim of that theory.
413200	415440	He bases his actions on the notion of love,
415440	418080	he's the sort of guy who would punch you in the name of love.
418080	420880	The haters knew how much love was out there and how much support was out there,
420880	422160	they'd shut their freaking mouths.
422880	425200	There's one video that kind of pushes this example,
425200	427920	it's the video in which Greg Paul confronts paparazzi.
427920	430720	Now, it would take someone very talented to make me feel sorry
430720	433440	for individuals who follow you around everywhere and take pictures,
433440	435840	and I'm not sure Greg Paul quite achieves that,
435840	437520	but I'll give him points for trying.
437520	440640	Being loud and obnoxious, being all in your face,
440640	442240	it's all for the love, my man.
442240	443200	Gotta have that love.
443920	446880	I've been talking about intentions a lot on this channel recently.
446880	448400	I said in my Nicole Arber video,
448400	451600	the good causes do not absolve terrible execution.
451600	454400	I do believe that many of these adults are quite aware of that,
454400	455280	they're not stupid.
455280	459040	I think Greg Paul's expression of this notion is excessively transparent,
459040	461200	but nonetheless, in spite of its contrivances,
461200	463040	some people still eat that shit up.
463040	465840	Despite the simple truth that if he'd done all the same things,
465840	467680	just out of anger or vitriol,
467680	469840	he wouldn't be given the same treatment.
470400	471280	Why is this?
471280	473200	Well, people like to justify their actions,
473200	476800	even when their actions may seem illogical to the individual in question.
476800	481040	Now, I have no doubt that there is a rationale behind the way that Greg Paul behaves,
481040	482880	but love is not that rationale.
482880	485760	Love is what he uses as a shield to deflect the idea
485760	488960	that sometimes he behaves in a less than socially aware manner.
488960	491440	This becomes increasingly transparent when you turn
491440	494320	to some of the more controversial statements that he put out.
494320	497200	My favorite video being the one he posted on his Instagram,
497200	499680	in response to the scrutiny Logan received,
499680	502240	many of it I'd argue justifiably so.
502240	503360	He made this statement.
506720	508560	Yo folks, what's happening?
508640	509760	GP coming at you.
509760	512560	Hey, a couple things I want to let everybody know that Logan is coming back.
512560	513360	That is definite.
513920	516080	A little bit of the bus update.
516080	517760	I put a new insulated floor in.
518560	520400	I've got some kitchen cabinets going in.
520400	522800	I've got a couple dressers I'm going to use for storage.
523520	524880	And it's coming along nice.
524880	526480	I'm having fun with this thing.
526480	530800	Also, the amount of love that has been coming has been unbelievable.
530800	532720	The amount of people showing support is unbelievable.
532720	534720	And I am now calling you guys super fans.
535600	536800	Because, you know, it's crazy.
536800	538800	As the haters think they're having an effect on us,
538800	540560	and if the haters knew how much love was out there
540560	541840	and how much support was out there,
541840	543200	they'd shut their freaking mouths.
543840	547520	The haters will never, ever have an effect on the Paul family
547520	549280	and the way that they want to make it happen,
549280	550640	because the love is too strong.
550640	551600	We all make mistakes.
551600	553760	Dr. Phil even said, hey, Logan's a good kid.
553760	554480	He's made a mistake.
554480	555520	He's 22 years old.
556560	558400	Push through it, get over it, and keep moving on.
558400	559520	Anyways, love you guys.
559520	560240	Love the support.
560800	561520	GP's out.
562160	565920	What Greg has done here is create a dichotomy from his earlier content,
565920	567600	where he preaches love and kindness.
567600	571280	And therefore, what he does here is equivocate his being to love.
571280	574800	And therefore, if you are opposed to the Pauls, you are thus opposed to love.
574800	578320	And on top of that, you're not just opposed to love, you are a hater.
578320	580640	There is no clarification on the sort of hate.
580640	582800	He doesn't qualify it with any statement.
582800	586880	It's just the haters won't get to him because he's got all this love inside of him.
586880	590240	Listen, there were clearly people who probably responded to Logan's actions
590240	594080	as irresponsible as they were in an irrational and disproportionate manner.
594080	598080	But Greg doesn't concern himself to clarify that he may be addressing a fringe group.
598080	602480	He's more interested in blanket statements and labels to give his fans that validation.
602480	605920	And even if he was addressing a fringe group, it would seem like a deflection anyway,
605920	608800	especially if you're not going to directly address it.
608800	612880	Also, general terminology, saying that people you claim to be haters would quote,
612880	618000	shut their freaking mouths if they knew about all the love you have, is a bit of a contradiction.
618000	622480	Greg always appeals to these basic emotional concepts as a way to distract from the fact
622480	625360	there is no real way to defend how people act sometimes.
625360	629360	But as long as he holds down that love sector, these people, they're just haters,
629360	631600	and he's got the love right here to hold them off.
631600	636640	So what was Greg referring to when he mentioned that transcendent concept of love that was just
636640	637600	out there?
637600	641200	Well, one of the other observations I made was how Greg likes to reflect
641200	643920	and discuss all the people that he and Jake have assisted.
643920	648160	And Logan, of course, I believe he uses this as mental justification in his own head
648160	650080	for the wrongdoings that may be committed.
650080	655680	I have had DMs with a lot of people talking about issues,
655680	659440	talking about them trying to commit suicide, and I've responded to a lot of people
659440	662640	said, hey, be strong, appreciate your writing, things like that.
662640	665120	I also noticed this on one of Jake's diss tracks,
665120	668240	in which he responds to criticism by talking about the great stuff he does.
680080	690400	If you fuck up and you accept you fuck up,
690400	694320	the best thing to do is remember that you have the capacity to do good with that influence
694320	697360	rather than attempting to retell all the times that you've done good
697360	700080	or noting it as some general love, because by doing that,
700080	703200	it immediately trivializes the actions that you have committed
703200	704960	and the motivations for committing them.
705040	707120	As the famous philosopher Cool Cat once said,
714320	717520	I'd also like to bring attention to what I call the loyalty card,
717520	721040	which isn't exactly the one you use in the supermache per se.
721040	722880	No, I mean the sort of one that's used by people
722880	725680	when they thank those for standing by them through the tough times.
725680	728400	In this instance, Greg Paul's use of the loyalty cards
728400	730480	upgrades the fans to super fans,
731440	736320	which of course means absolutely nothing to anyone above the age of 12,
736320	738800	but is a sort of emotional reward that may gratify
738800	741520	the sort of unconditional supporter of the Pauls.
741520	744640	It's always nice to experience appreciation from those we admire,
744640	747120	however most of us are at that age where we realize
747120	750400	the impersonality of YouTube celebrities saying it through the screen.
750400	752640	Basically, it probably doesn't mean much,
752640	755360	but if there's anything that the Paul fanbase has taught us,
755360	758240	is that people are still very easily influenced.
758240	761280	Now, the loyalty card isn't an intrinsically bad asset,
761280	764080	plenty of creators have it and use it on a regular basis,
764080	765280	it is natural in a way,
765280	767600	but when you abuse it to the level of Greg Paul,
767600	770000	the loyalty becomes a tool to override logic,
770000	772320	and I want you to hold on to this point for later.
772320	774240	It's been a while since I've had a guest on,
774240	777200	so I thought I'd mix it up and bring in my good friend Urbot,
777200	778400	also known as Wooly One,
778400	781840	and he did some research into Greg Paul's cyberbullying escapades.
781840	782880	Not sure what that is?
782880	784320	Well, you're in for a treat.
784320	785360	Take it away my friend.
785360	788880	Hello everyone, I'm Wooly One,
788880	791360	contributing-pologist on The Right Opinion's channel.
791920	794880	So Greg Paul, being a 54-year-old man,
794880	797520	has found it difficult to fit in on the internet.
797520	800880	From some of his videos, it's clear he simply does not understand
800880	804560	how basic things that YouTubers deal with every day work.
804560	807760	And it's not just through his somewhat cringey persona,
807760	810160	it's through the ideas that he has suggested.
810160	813520	The example we are going to look at today is cyberbullying.
813520	816400	Now, cyberbullying is a very new form of harassment
816400	819200	because it takes place on a very new medium, the internet.
819200	821600	It's also an incredibly easy form of harassment
821600	825360	because you can get the satisfaction of speaking your mind about another person
825360	827600	without having to see their reaction live.
827600	831520	Louis CK, you know, the comedian, the guy who,
831520	834240	yeah, he put it best in an interview with Conan O'Brien.
834240	836960	So kids are mean and it's because they're trying it out.
838560	839520	They look at a kid and they go,
839520	842640	you're fat, and then they see the kid's face scrunch up and they go,
842640	845120	ooh, that doesn't feel good to make a person do that.
845680	847680	But they got to start with doing the mean thing.
847680	850800	Because these insults are bytes and data
850800	854160	seemingly posted by one person and received by another,
854160	857360	Greg Paul thinks this issue can easily be solved.
857360	861520	About a year ago, Greg Paul posted a very interesting video titled,
861520	865760	Cyberbullying is real! My thoughts on everything Logan and Jake Paul.
865760	867440	Hashtag the second verse.
867440	870480	He starts off by addressing some of the hot rumors at the time,
870480	874400	particularly the Alyssa Violet situation, which James will touch on later.
874400	877680	He makes a really weird point about perception versus reality,
877680	881040	where he calls out Jake and Logan's own pranks by name,
881040	883200	and he tells you that they were staged.
883200	886240	Just remember, a lot of the same people coming at me
887120	888800	really believed Jake was in the White House.
888800	891440	They really believed Dwarf Mamba was shipped in an airplane.
892000	892880	None of it was true.
892880	895680	But then he tries to connect it back to the truth
895680	897360	and how the viewers perceive the truth.
897360	902400	And a lot of it is somebody's perception of how they saw things.
902400	905600	He basically leaves you with the impression that it was the viewers' fault
905600	908240	that they didn't understand that the pranks were staged.
908240	911840	And in a similar way, they don't understand the Alyssa Violet situation.
911840	915760	It's a very loose connection that doesn't really seem to help his case.
915760	920240	After all, if Jake and Logan Paul wanted their viewers to get the right idea about their content,
920240	921920	why don't they just not lie to them?
921920	924800	About five minutes in though, he switches gears.
924800	930000	You see, in his coverage of this Alyssa Violet situation, he's received a great deal of hate.
930000	933120	Now, most YouTubers would probably just block and ignore them.
933120	935440	But Greg Paul has a different idea.
935440	938240	Instead, he proposes a cyberbullying database
938240	940720	where people are named and branded as cyberbullies.
954800	968720	And this database can be accessed by, well, pretty much anyone.
968720	972480	Parents, teachers, employers, significant others, and yes, the police.
972480	975600	If this idea sounds extremely Orwellian and horrible,
975600	978560	you're thinking at least a little more rationally than Greg here.
978560	983200	There are so many problems with a database of this nature that become immediately apparent.
983200	986160	For example, that most threats are made anonymously,
986160	988960	and without an extremely invasive police investigation,
988960	994320	the only identification people would have access to would be their general location, if that at all.
994320	999200	But let's assume, as Greg does, that one would be able to easily log this information.
999200	1002560	He still essentially wants a nine-year-old telling you to KYS
1002560	1005120	to be treated with the same severity and seriousness
1005120	1009600	as a 60-year-old homeless man whipping his dick out in front of preschoolers on a playground.
1009600	1012240	Even to most of the technologically inept,
1012240	1014880	this sounds incredibly stupid and ineffective.
1014880	1019440	Not to mention how easy it would be to fake the evidence with Inspect Element or Photoshop,
1019440	1021840	two things that Greg probably hasn't even heard of.
1021840	1022960	It just wouldn't work.
1022960	1025680	And while Greg may be a seasoned human being,
1025680	1028320	he's not a seasoned YouTuber, so he just doesn't get it.
1028880	1034080	Well, fast forward a year and prepubescent YouTube commenters with anime profile pictures
1034080	1036800	have not been rounded up and shot into mass graves yet.
1036800	1038400	So what happened?
1038400	1039600	Well, nothing, I guess.
1039600	1043360	For a few months after his video, he continued talking on Instagram
1043360	1047520	about how he was definitely going to create this database and how he was going to do it right.
1047520	1052080	Like his video, he also mentioned working with the LAPD to get it off the ground.
1052080	1055440	And each time, he promised to do away with these vile cyberbullies
1055440	1058560	who'd been sending hate to him, but it just never happened.
1058560	1061760	There still is no database, and I doubt there ever will be.
1061760	1062320	Why?
1062320	1065520	Well, maybe he realized how much of an idiotic concept this was
1065520	1068080	from the numerous comments and dislikes on the video.
1068080	1071440	Or maybe he never had any intention of creating such a database
1071440	1075280	and only conceived of it as a threat to freak out those who were insulting him.
1075280	1077520	Perhaps he was just doing it to make himself look better,
1077520	1082240	especially considering he was in a video about an already highly controversial topic,
1082240	1086240	using it as yet another means to shove his love down your throat and evade criticism.
1086240	1090720	I think that one of the conclusions that can be drawn from the Greg Paul cyberbullying saga
1090720	1096080	is that the man himself seems deeply concerned about others when something happens to him.
1096080	1097280	Now, what do I mean by this?
1097280	1102000	Well, in the video, he states constantly about how he doesn't care about all the hate he's received.
1102000	1102500	Guess what?
1103040	1104160	I don't care what you call me.
1104160	1104640	Doesn't matter.
1104640	1107040	The fact that you're calling me a faggot and you think it's offensive?
1107040	1107360	Where are you?
1107360	1109200	Are you living in 1952?
1109200	1110880	This is 2017.
1110880	1114960	If you got an issue with somebody in their sexual orientation, that's too bad for you.
1114960	1115920	Those aren't my issues.
1115920	1117840	The fact that you're calling me old and bald?
1117840	1118560	I don't really care.
1118560	1122000	Uh, a lot of you guys said you know why Pam and I got divorced?
1122000	1124880	Listen, 50% of the couples out there get divorced.
1124880	1128560	The 50% that are married, another 25% want to get divorced.
1128560	1133120	So trying to slam me because I got divorced doesn't bother me.
1133120	1134560	It has no value.
1134560	1136320	It's all water off the duck's back for him.
1136320	1138640	He's so resolute that you can call him a faggot.
1138640	1142560	And if you're not down with the gays in 2017, well, that's your problem.
1142560	1146560	However, Greg Paul is so concerned that it might happen to someone else
1146560	1148960	that isn't as strong and resolute as him
1148960	1153840	that he wants to set up this database that takes down everyone who says something mean.
1153840	1155680	All you folks that sent me the hate mail,
1156800	1159920	I think you're going to be the first ones that I expose
1159920	1164880	and let the general public know that you guys are out there trying to be bullies.
1164880	1168160	And listen, there's nothing wrong with looking out for other people.
1168160	1172880	But when you suddenly start caring about something for the sole reason of it happening to you,
1172880	1177520	saying that you don't care about the fact that it happens to you seems fairly hard to believe.
1177520	1182880	And it seems like a real attempt to switch the fact that he's upset about what someone did to him
1182880	1188160	as a way to simultaneously look better, like a crusader against all those bad, nasty bullies.
1188160	1192240	But this is just indicative of how Greg Paul really tries to find
1192240	1196000	anything that's happened to him as a way to pole vault himself into relevancy.
1196000	1197920	He needs the spotlight to be on him.
1197920	1202480	So by seizing the opportunity to do something revolutionary in his head,
1202480	1206480	it would give him that attention, even when his reaction, as I showed earlier,
1206480	1210800	is completely irrational and symptomatic of his technological naivety.
1210800	1212320	Anyway, back to you, Jimbo.
1212880	1217280	As noted earlier, this was part of a greater video on the Alyssa Violet situation,
1217280	1219040	in which she left the Team 10 house.
1219040	1224240	Both Jake and Alyssa told very contrasting stories about what exactly happened within the premises.
1224240	1227280	But Greg Paul then decided to join in and tell his own story,
1227280	1229120	which is interesting to say the least.
1229120	1232160	In this story, he declared that Alyssa wasn't kicked out for cheating,
1232160	1235840	as Jake claimed, or anything else, but she was removed for not paying rent.
1235840	1237440	Alyssa wasn't kicked out of the house.
1238400	1240160	She was asked to leave because she wasn't paying rent.
1240160	1243920	And at the center of this bizarre story is the father, Mr. Greg Paul himself,
1243920	1247680	who in spite of barely turning up in either of the other members' testaments,
1247680	1251120	apart from a cameo in Alyssa's where she claimed he verbally abused her in public.
1260800	1262720	He had a leading role in his story.
1262720	1266560	In this retelling, Alyssa Violet was belligerently remaining in the Team 10 house,
1266560	1267920	and she would not budge.
1267920	1271760	Greg Paul, the gracious, cogent gentleman, sat down with her,
1271760	1275520	and gave her some top-notch advice on that Greg Paul, the man himself,
1275520	1278240	managed to bring her time at Team 10 to an end.
1283360	1286720	In case you've noticed an undertone of sarcasm in my voice,
1286720	1289120	it's because I am being fucking sarcastic.
1289120	1292160	And frankly, this is some of the thickest bullshit that I've heard in a while.
1293040	1295760	Warning! Warning! Bullshit alert!
1295760	1299600	Greg Paul claims that a lot of Alyssa Violet's allegations cannot be backed up,
1303680	1307760	before making a number of unsubstantiated claims himself and just saying,
1307760	1308960	well it's the truth.
1308960	1313520	She did miss auditions because of not being able to wake up and make it on time.
1314080	1316560	These things are all the truth. These things actually happen.
1316560	1319680	I also find it amusing that he has to interject multiple times in the video
1319680	1321840	to remind the viewer that he is telling the truth,
1321840	1324560	and reminds us all that everyone in Team 10 likes him,
1324560	1326400	because he's hard working for those people.
1347040	1350800	I'm not saying that he's not, but the self-validation is pretty suspicious.
1350800	1354480	To prove his moral worth, he says that his level of truth is so strong
1354480	1358240	that there are lawyers who have offered to take his case for free against Alyssa Violet,
1358240	1361360	but he's not going to do that because he's above all the petty drama,
1361360	1363280	he's above the lying and the hatred.
1363280	1366720	He's so moral, don't we all wish we could be like Gregory here?
1366720	1367920	Not quite, right?
1368560	1370080	This tells me two things.
1370080	1373120	Firstly, that Greg Paul is a pretty bad liar.
1373120	1374720	There are multiple cues for lying,
1374720	1378400	most notably the disturbing amount of times he licks his lips in that video.
1380800	1404080	Which in comparison to his other videos is quite disproportionate,
1404080	1406080	but who cares, maybe it was a hot day,
1406080	1410080	Greg's lips have just been so dry in need of that constant moisturising.
1410080	1411840	Maybe a boy just thirsty.
1413040	1415760	After all, the biggest indicator that he's chatting shit
1415760	1418800	is the story doesn't even match the one told by his son Jakey here.
1418800	1421920	Jake claimed that Alyssa cheated on him, but maybe he was wrong too,
1421920	1423600	maybe Greg is actually Thanos,
1423600	1427120	and is using the reality stone to manipulate the world that Team 10 lives in.
1427120	1430240	It's still more plausible than any of the stories that Greg is actually telling.
1430240	1433120	Greg also has this perfect way of twisting what people say.
1433120	1436880	He states that Alyssa saying that she thought he was going to pull a gun out was unfair,
1436880	1440640	which as a point, a standalone point, I guess, stands,
1440640	1442080	but then goes on to say this.
1450960	1454720	Which given the additional context is a blatantly dishonest way of framing it,
1454720	1458960	and anyone who understands basic rhetorical devices knows exactly what she's implying.
1466960	1471280	And I think you do too, Greg.
1471280	1474160	All I'm saying is you're not making a good case for yourself here, buddy.
1474160	1477360	In fact, in another video where he once again truthfully recollects
1477360	1479840	a story of the Martinez twins and their departure,
1479840	1483680	he drops the disclaimer that he often makes very little eye contact with the camera,
1483680	1486880	and that is normal behaviour, so don't try and investigate him for lying.
1496880	1501280	After all, if you act like a liar all the time, people can't specifically call out the lies,
1501280	1503520	although the licking lips are pretty excessive.
1504320	1505120	Tasty.
1505120	1509600	What I've found from all these videos is that Greg likes to insert himself into these situations,
1509600	1511520	and be as intimate to the drama as possible.
1511520	1514560	He takes credit for the savage shirt that the Martinez twins wear,
1514560	1516400	says that they were referring to him as a dad,
1516400	1521440	and wanted him to be their manager before this other manager came in and disrupted the whole situation.
1521680	1529200	Every story involves him, despite many of the anecdotes
1529200	1532400	from other individuals within the Team 10 house seldom including him.
1532400	1534560	The details that Greg provides would lead you to believe that
1534560	1537680	he's actually a member of Team 10, let alone involved in it.
1537680	1539760	Why this level of involvement though?
1539760	1543440	Well, one reason appears pretty obvious, that it's good for views and interaction,
1543440	1546480	and people always want to hear the hottest takes from those in the know,
1546480	1550640	and Greg Paul is definitely in the know, he's just not entirely in the tell.
1550640	1554720	The other idea is that he likes to see himself as involved in his children's lives,
1554720	1557360	which isn't a completely unreasonable explanation either,
1557360	1561360	as I said at the start, he brands himself as the father to these two icons,
1561360	1566400	above all other representations of his character, and his content plays into this narrative.
1566400	1569920	But I want to reintroduce a couple of points that I mentioned briefly earlier.
1569920	1572480	A lot of the issue that the Paul family tends to culminate
1572480	1574880	is that their interactions are out in the public eye,
1574880	1577120	and that's not a huge issue as principle,
1577120	1579600	but as families we are more likely to defend each other,
1579600	1583360	because we believe we know the character of the individual better than the criticism
1583360	1586480	from the outsiders, and these people are intimate to our lives,
1586480	1589200	we don't want conflict by publicly shouting them down,
1589200	1593440	and frankly, I wouldn't expect Greg Paul to go around publicly lambasting his children,
1593440	1596400	and if you want to defend them, then that's not necessarily a bad thing either,
1596400	1600480	but there comes a point where defending an individual not just comes at a detriment to you,
1600480	1603040	but to them and other individuals around them.
1605280	1608320	If there's one thing that Jake and Logan's behaviour has taught us,
1608320	1611760	is that they are really in desperate need of some real world experience.
1611760	1614720	They're hardly children, but you'd be hard pressed to find behaviour
1614720	1616560	that matches their respective maturity,
1616560	1619360	whether it's obnoxiousness or just plain insensitivity,
1619360	1621200	they seem to have all the boxes ticked.
1621200	1625200	Much of their behaviour seems to lean onto the fact they don't recognise the implications
1625200	1627200	that their actions have on those around them.
1627200	1631200	As implied by this video, I find Greg Paul's rhetoric rather dishonest,
1631200	1633680	but on top of that, I find it quite hawkish.
1633680	1635280	It's one thing to defend your children,
1635280	1640000	but it's another to then try to assassinate the characters of those who make these allegations.
1640000	1644160	Gregory is preaching all this love while simultaneously making highly questionable
1644160	1646160	and unsubstantiated claims against people,
1646160	1650160	attacking their character with anecdotal evidence which given the additional context,
1650160	1651280	seems rather doubtful.
1651280	1655200	But even then, consistently dismissing his detractors on all fronts does not look good
1655200	1659680	by any means, and most worryingly it creates an atmosphere in which no lessons are already learnt.
1659680	1662240	The whole way to right your wrongs begins with accepting
1662240	1664400	that you may have committed those wrongs here and there.
1664400	1666240	All this little investigation has shown to me
1666240	1669440	is that our mate Gregory here doesn't really wish to acknowledge that.
1669440	1672480	In response to the Logan Paul scenario, the best he could say was
1672480	1675200	we all make mistakes and appeal to Dr Phil.
1675200	1678800	Which once again is not false, but is underplaying the circumstances.
1678800	1683440	You also write a paragraph in the description about how they sometimes do stuff you disagree with.
1683440	1688320	This is not a case of agreement or disagreement, and portraying it that way is very myopic.
1688320	1690640	The thing is, in the context of modern society,
1690640	1693440	many people have standards of how they should treat others.
1693440	1696000	Everyone kind of differs a bit, but there is a baseline.
1696000	1699840	Most of what has been discussed today is not a case of different strokes for different folks,
1699840	1702240	it's about showing some respect to a fellow human being.
1702240	1705600	The issue that Greg Paul creates is when he dismisses those who confront him,
1705600	1708400	and being prepared to seemingly lie about these situations,
1708400	1710880	that he cements himself as a constant scapegoat
1710880	1714240	for whatever destructive actions Jake or Logan may commit.
1714240	1717440	It enables them, knowing that they have that unconditional parachute,
1717440	1719200	but sometimes they need to free fall.
1719200	1720880	You don't have to publicly shit on them,
1720880	1724240	but you just have to stop trying to make up these very transparent excuses
1724240	1726480	for what is fairly deplorable behaviour.
1726480	1728080	As I noted at the start of the video,
1728080	1731120	Greg Paul had recently been called in and he was conducting an audit,
1731120	1734160	and Nick Crompton leaving was a huge moment for the Ensembler,
1734160	1737760	and the differences seem fairly obvious from the inception of this incident.
1737760	1739200	However, very shortly after this,
1739200	1742160	Team 10 put out a very bizarre statement on their twitter,
1742160	1746160	which seemed to echo much of the attitude reflected in Greg Paul's behaviour,
1746160	1748480	in a worrying totalitarian attitude.
1748480	1751920	Notice the excessive and transparent use of the loyalty card,
1751920	1756240	and this is something that Greg Paul clearly values himself above all other aspects.
1756240	1758160	In his video over the Martinez twins,
1758160	1760560	he lamented the fact that he was right about Max,
1760560	1762000	another former Team 10 member.
1778480	1782480	Despite the fact that Max left because he was uncomfortable with how the Pauls were presenting
1782480	1784800	a possible assault case against FaZe Banks,
1784800	1786960	one that seemed incredibly dishonest.
1786960	1789360	Yet Greg Paul sees Max as a negative actor,
1789360	1794000	despite the fact that Max's move was one of the most arguably moral in the history of Team 10.
1794000	1795840	Greg saw it as a selfish action,
1795840	1798960	how could he do that to people who gave him such an opportunity?
1798960	1801920	That's because Gregory sees its influence as a collective,
1801920	1804960	everything good that has come from Team 10 outweighs the bad,
1805040	1808640	and from his perspective, if people stop trying to milk all these negative actions,
1808640	1812720	then the collective could just carry on spreading this joy and this love.
1812720	1816480	Through this love premise, Greg has always the loyalty card to maximum gain,
1816480	1821040	telling us about how he knows all the people who have had their lives enhanced by Team 10,
1821040	1824320	you are there for Team 10, you are subservient to Team 10.
1824320	1828480	Also I thought it'd be interesting to note how the little text started much like the
1828480	1832320	Instagram video, with that chunk of gratitude to the fans for their support,
1832320	1834640	its contrivance almost nauseating.
1834640	1838080	The aura that this statement gave off was much alike to a cult,
1838080	1841440	if you are disloyal to what Team 10 represents then you are struck off,
1841440	1844160	but that would premise that Team 10 is a positive force,
1844160	1847200	which is a bit more up for debate than Greg presents it to be,
1847200	1851040	he forgets that although Team 10 may have supposedly enhanced some people's lives,
1851040	1853520	it could also have negatively affected others.
1853520	1857840	The other factor that Greg doesn't seem to take into consideration is the alternate reality,
1857840	1862720	where Team 10 doesn't exist, now it's here sure some people may have found purpose within it,
1862720	1867440	but they may have found a different purpose in something more productive if Team 10 didn't exist,
1867440	1869840	and it may not be beneficial for them long term.
1869840	1874560	But Greg doesn't work on that level of reasoning, and therefore because Team 10 is so helpful,
1874560	1879040	people should respect it regardless of what they do, the ends justify the means in his mind,
1879040	1882400	but his idea of means are different to many of his critics,
1882400	1887440	so it doesn't matter how allegedly rude or aggressive he is, it's for Team 10, it's for love.
1887440	1890720	Judging from its language I think it's fair to assume that this little message
1890720	1895040	had at least a bit of Greg sprinkled on it, and this takes me to my next point.
1896400	1902160	Jake Paul made a video himself addressing the situation, in what was 20 minutes of unbelievable
1902160	1906560	waffle that would put me on my most drunken terrain to shame, he stumbles through an explanation
1906560	1910720	of how there's a future, and how he's planning for it, and how the people who left were afraid
1910720	1915440	of his visions. Amongst the filler that was clearly done for the ad rev, I did find some
1915440	1919840	statements of meaning, and I think they can tell something about the sorry situation that he finds
1919840	1923920	himself in. Two parts stood out, the part in which he discusses his father, and the one that
1923920	1928400	follows on from this. But what does he say about Greg specifically, well he said he needed someone
1928400	1933520	to unconditionally fight his corner with the increasingly ambitious visions and ideas,
1933520	1938560	he needed someone with more life experience to step in and help with possible individuals who
1938560	1943760	might suck away that Jake Paul exuberance. And you know what, I'd probably do the same thing in his
1943760	1949200	position, however the issue that this creates is a character evolution, because what Jake has in mind
1949200	1953920	is more audacious, and likely more bombastic behaviour. One moment that I found distinctly
1953920	1958640	symbolic was how he almost said he wanted to become the best person, before suddenly
1958640	1968800	changing a qualifying statement to the best Jake Paul. The thing is that these two are distinctly
1968800	1973440	different statements, and Jake realises that. I spoke about respect and decency earlier,
1973440	1978160	and Jake needs someone to challenge that attitude rather than condoning it, especially if he doesn't
1978160	1982320	want to burn out. There is no doubt that Jake will continue to be successful, and let's say
1982320	1987200	Team 10 is a positive force, if it has brought joy to many people's lives then fair enough,
1987200	1992160	we can always do better, and when people call out individuals like Jake for his destructive and
1992160	1996480	reckless behaviour, whether Team 10 is a net positive is kinda regardless when it comes to
1996480	2001520	these issues, if you can do better, why wouldn't you do better? Greg just doesn't accept this,
2001520	2006320	and under the premise that Team 10 is a force for good, publicly dismisses, and attempts to smear
2006320	2010320	other individuals in the name of that good cause, but most importantly not encouraging
2010320	2015200	self reflection, not just within your family, but within fans, who for some reason then see you
2015200	2021040	justifying actions and using the loyalty and false notion of positivity to blow off others as haters,
2021040	2025440	while formulating your own plotlines. I'm sorry, but for someone with life experience,
2025440	2030720	you should know better. What Greg Paul is up to in Team 10 I cannot be certain, it is not mine to
2030720	2034720	prove, but although it may provide Jake with some business grounding, I can't see it being wholly
2034720	2038640	beneficial for many other aspects. Jake Paul needs someone who is going to support him,
2038640	2042720	but is also going to correct him, he's been in this world 21 years, and he needs the right
2042720	2048720	guidance now he's actually trying to deal with life. Unfortunately, life is not one long vine
2048720	2052960	clip. Equally as unfortunate, Greg does not seem the person to alleviate the problems that have
2052960	2057040	been observed by multiple commentators, on the contrary his behaviour seems to lead to
2057040	2060720	reinforcement which I personally believe will not lead to favourable outcomes.
2060720	2065520	This brings me to my second point about Jake's video, the idea that it was best for Jake.
2065520	2070000	The problem is that Greg is solely concerned with Jake, but what is best for Jake is not
2070000	2074640	necessarily best for Team 10, and when you continuously cause people from Team 10 to leave,
2074640	2078240	the people inside will inevitably become expendable and lose the draw that they gave
2078240	2082160	to the squad, it becomes Jake Paul and his background answers, and it will inevitably
2082160	2087120	lead people to question whether there even is a necessity for Team 10. So although people saying
2087120	2091680	Team 10 is falling apart is an exaggeration, it does cause a possible loss of identity,
2091680	2095600	the starting lineup established identity for themselves, the new ones appear to lack that,
2095600	2101920	but either Greg Paul doesn't know or doesn't care. Once again, loyalty matters, but so does logic.
2101920	2105840	It will inevitably become the Jake Paul show which if that's what you want then fair enough,
2105840	2110640	but I don't want more Jake Paul in my life. The idea of Jake Paul having complete free reign
2110640	2114560	is slightly concerning. Whether Jake Paul is conscious of this himself is a different
2114560	2118240	question, but either way I do not see Greg benefiting Jake as an individual,
2118240	2123200	nor Team 10 as a collective, I'm not saying it's going to happen soon, but if it does we know why.
2123200	2127760	At the centre of the Paul family, we find a man who although may not be the image of the brand,
2127760	2132720	is certainly exerting influence on a day to day basis, either over his sons, over an audience,
2132720	2137920	or over others around him. Where that influence is positive as I present today is highly tentative,
2137920	2143280	and the means that he uses to exert it is even more dubious. That man is Greg Paul.
2144160	2148480	What do you think of the situation? What is exactly going on here? I would love to hear
2148480	2152720	what you think. Leave your comments down below, I'm always interested to hear.
