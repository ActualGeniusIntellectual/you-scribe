00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I hate to be a downer

00:07.400 --> 00:12.580
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the right opinion the home of a twat with too much free time and Matt Hoss

00:12.880 --> 00:14.300
What a scumbag

00:14.300 --> 00:14.800
Yes

00:14.800 --> 00:21.560
The sheer amount of mental turmoil that he has put h2a3 over a single video has guaranteed him a special seat in hell

00:21.880 --> 00:24.400
Regardless of what you think of their content

00:24.400 --> 00:25.880
Vape nation

00:25.880 --> 00:32.400
I genuinely cannot stand the man a selfish egomaniac whose videos were no better than mediocre in the first place

00:32.400 --> 00:34.940
He recently announced the date of the supposed court hearing

00:34.940 --> 00:38.920
I didn't watch the video as I didn't want to grant him that thousandth of a cent for the view

00:38.920 --> 00:43.440
I found it out. Otherwise, hopefully I think it's sometime in April, but I found that on reddit

00:43.440 --> 00:46.160
So if I'm wrong, tell me I can be wrong on facts

00:46.800 --> 00:51.640
Not opinions though, of course, but everyone's relatively confident, right? Right?

00:52.240 --> 00:58.000
I'm not well not as much as I'd like to be at least you see we as a YouTube community know that this whole lawsuit

00:58.000 --> 01:02.680
Is ridiculous and the video contained enough commentary to be described as constructive

01:02.680 --> 01:07.640
We wouldn't watch Matt Hoss's video if Ethan and Hila hadn't provided their banterous remarks to add on to it

01:07.640 --> 01:12.840
But we're not there to tell them that talking and we can't trust them to take Ethan's word on that

01:12.840 --> 01:19.240
For example, they didn't believe Ray William Johnson when he went up against Duke and media and actually ruled in favor of the large video

01:19.240 --> 01:24.080
Sharing corporation and to be fair Matt Hoss doesn't have quite the same weight as Duke and media

01:24.200 --> 01:27.240
Regardless of what he thinks of himself my parents put me in pussy

01:28.160 --> 01:33.120
I've been a champion ever since and h3h3 do more than Ray William Johnson

01:33.120 --> 01:37.240
Whereas Johnson was more of a reporter even the healer are more commentators

01:37.240 --> 01:41.960
But one of the problems that makes h3h3 productions an easier time at the most commentary channels

01:41.960 --> 01:48.460
Is that they've always labeled themselves as a reaction channel and that makes them vulnerable to being tarred with the same brush with these other

01:48.460 --> 01:52.060
Channels that don't add anything on as a reaction is different to criticism

01:52.060 --> 01:57.180
Even though I and many others have always considered h3h3 a channel that builds greatly on the content that they look at

01:57.180 --> 02:01.340
I don't trust them to see the same picture and maybe that's just because I'm not very trusting person

02:01.340 --> 02:04.740
But there are a lot of idiots in the world and you never know where they're gonna be

02:04.740 --> 02:09.540
My main concern is that there's a court full of middle-aged people who don't have experience in this area

02:09.540 --> 02:13.600
And in a way you don't always expect people to have an understanding of such a situation

02:13.640 --> 02:14.440
But I think

02:14.440 --> 02:21.600
Inexperience lends a disadvantage to Ethan healer on these accounts that if I was brushing the surface you could say that they're not doing anything

02:22.000 --> 02:26.280
Transformative even though after watching many of their videos it's clear to me and many others

02:26.280 --> 02:32.320
They do most of these creators a favor by giving them extra exposure Ethan and healers content is not malign

02:32.320 --> 02:36.220
It's typically very casual very light-hearted and obviously as it's not as critical

02:36.220 --> 02:42.760
It does make them a soft target and exploiting that especially when the video was nothing personal is pretty

02:43.200 --> 02:49.720
reprehensible and the fact that Matt Hoss probably benefited of their initial video and then has the audacity to file a

02:50.040 --> 02:57.400
Fucking lawsuit probably with some of the money he made from that fucking exposure that video gave fucking disgusting

02:59.320 --> 03:06.520
And Ethan Nila have wasted copious amounts of money on lawyers just to maximize their chance and they did not have to do this

03:06.560 --> 03:11.480
They could have just settle with four thousand dollars passing over to that twat and we'd all be

03:11.840 --> 03:18.640
Fucking fucked by lawyers coming round like the fucking tax collectors asking us for money because we use their fucking videos

03:18.640 --> 03:25.280
this is about the community and I really hope they do win because they deserve to and everyone is in near

03:25.580 --> 03:32.460
Unanimous agreement that Matt Hoss is trying to ruin YouTube for everyone and I have a message for those like Matt Hoss

03:32.460 --> 03:35.220
Who want to tear down the foundations?

03:35.220 --> 03:40.180
There's so many have worked so hard and so look borously to put up that without it

03:40.180 --> 03:44.060
Your pathetic little channel probably wouldn't exist in the first place

03:44.060 --> 03:48.520
You won't even have a platform to perform your audacious publicity stunts

03:48.620 --> 03:56.580
But remember we are stronger than you so you can fucking pull the carpet from under our feet and we will get up again

03:56.580 --> 03:59.940
You can try to shackle us with your fucking

04:00.860 --> 04:03.160
Egocentrism, but we will break the chains

04:03.160 --> 04:08.880
You could plunge a stake through the heart of this community and we will pull every last

04:09.320 --> 04:11.540
splinter out because for every

04:12.240 --> 04:16.620
Narcissistic braggart like you there's a whole fan base willing to get behind

04:17.200 --> 04:23.640
Positive cause that won't necessarily benefit them but because it's right and if there's one thing I know about

04:24.400 --> 04:27.160
It's righteousness. I'm the right opinion

04:28.680 --> 04:30.680
And here's to fair use

04:38.880 --> 04:40.880
You
