0	2000	I hate to be a downer
7400	12580	Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the right opinion the home of a twat with too much free time and Matt Hoss
12880	14300	What a scumbag
14300	14800	Yes
14800	21560	The sheer amount of mental turmoil that he has put h2a3 over a single video has guaranteed him a special seat in hell
21880	24400	Regardless of what you think of their content
24400	25880	Vape nation
25880	32400	I genuinely cannot stand the man a selfish egomaniac whose videos were no better than mediocre in the first place
32400	34940	He recently announced the date of the supposed court hearing
34940	38920	I didn't watch the video as I didn't want to grant him that thousandth of a cent for the view
38920	43440	I found it out. Otherwise, hopefully I think it's sometime in April, but I found that on reddit
43440	46160	So if I'm wrong, tell me I can be wrong on facts
46800	51640	Not opinions though, of course, but everyone's relatively confident, right? Right?
52240	58000	I'm not well not as much as I'd like to be at least you see we as a YouTube community know that this whole lawsuit
58000	62680	Is ridiculous and the video contained enough commentary to be described as constructive
62680	67640	We wouldn't watch Matt Hoss's video if Ethan and Hila hadn't provided their banterous remarks to add on to it
67640	72840	But we're not there to tell them that talking and we can't trust them to take Ethan's word on that
72840	79240	For example, they didn't believe Ray William Johnson when he went up against Duke and media and actually ruled in favor of the large video
79240	84080	Sharing corporation and to be fair Matt Hoss doesn't have quite the same weight as Duke and media
84200	87240	Regardless of what he thinks of himself my parents put me in pussy
88160	93120	I've been a champion ever since and h3h3 do more than Ray William Johnson
93120	97240	Whereas Johnson was more of a reporter even the healer are more commentators
97240	101960	But one of the problems that makes h3h3 productions an easier time at the most commentary channels
101960	108460	Is that they've always labeled themselves as a reaction channel and that makes them vulnerable to being tarred with the same brush with these other
108460	112060	Channels that don't add anything on as a reaction is different to criticism
112060	117180	Even though I and many others have always considered h3h3 a channel that builds greatly on the content that they look at
117180	121340	I don't trust them to see the same picture and maybe that's just because I'm not very trusting person
121340	124740	But there are a lot of idiots in the world and you never know where they're gonna be
124740	129540	My main concern is that there's a court full of middle-aged people who don't have experience in this area
129540	133600	And in a way you don't always expect people to have an understanding of such a situation
133640	134440	But I think
134440	141600	Inexperience lends a disadvantage to Ethan healer on these accounts that if I was brushing the surface you could say that they're not doing anything
142000	146280	Transformative even though after watching many of their videos it's clear to me and many others
146280	152320	They do most of these creators a favor by giving them extra exposure Ethan and healers content is not malign
152320	156220	It's typically very casual very light-hearted and obviously as it's not as critical
156220	162760	It does make them a soft target and exploiting that especially when the video was nothing personal is pretty
163200	169720	reprehensible and the fact that Matt Hoss probably benefited of their initial video and then has the audacity to file a
170040	177400	Fucking lawsuit probably with some of the money he made from that fucking exposure that video gave fucking disgusting
179320	186520	And Ethan Nila have wasted copious amounts of money on lawyers just to maximize their chance and they did not have to do this
186560	191480	They could have just settle with four thousand dollars passing over to that twat and we'd all be
191840	198640	Fucking fucked by lawyers coming round like the fucking tax collectors asking us for money because we use their fucking videos
198640	205280	this is about the community and I really hope they do win because they deserve to and everyone is in near
205580	212460	Unanimous agreement that Matt Hoss is trying to ruin YouTube for everyone and I have a message for those like Matt Hoss
212460	215220	Who want to tear down the foundations?
215220	220180	There's so many have worked so hard and so look borously to put up that without it
220180	224060	Your pathetic little channel probably wouldn't exist in the first place
224060	228520	You won't even have a platform to perform your audacious publicity stunts
228620	236580	But remember we are stronger than you so you can fucking pull the carpet from under our feet and we will get up again
236580	239940	You can try to shackle us with your fucking
240860	243160	Egocentrism, but we will break the chains
243160	248880	You could plunge a stake through the heart of this community and we will pull every last
249320	251540	splinter out because for every
252240	256620	Narcissistic braggart like you there's a whole fan base willing to get behind
257200	263640	Positive cause that won't necessarily benefit them but because it's right and if there's one thing I know about
264400	267160	It's righteousness. I'm the right opinion
268680	270680	And here's to fair use
278880	280880	You
