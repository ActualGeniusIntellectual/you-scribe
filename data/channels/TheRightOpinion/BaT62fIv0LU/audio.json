{"text": " I hate to be a downer Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the right opinion the home of a twat with too much free time and Matt Hoss What a scumbag Yes The sheer amount of mental turmoil that he has put h2a3 over a single video has guaranteed him a special seat in hell Regardless of what you think of their content Vape nation I genuinely cannot stand the man a selfish egomaniac whose videos were no better than mediocre in the first place He recently announced the date of the supposed court hearing I didn't watch the video as I didn't want to grant him that thousandth of a cent for the view I found it out. Otherwise, hopefully I think it's sometime in April, but I found that on reddit So if I'm wrong, tell me I can be wrong on facts Not opinions though, of course, but everyone's relatively confident, right? Right? I'm not well not as much as I'd like to be at least you see we as a YouTube community know that this whole lawsuit Is ridiculous and the video contained enough commentary to be described as constructive We wouldn't watch Matt Hoss's video if Ethan and Hila hadn't provided their banterous remarks to add on to it But we're not there to tell them that talking and we can't trust them to take Ethan's word on that For example, they didn't believe Ray William Johnson when he went up against Duke and media and actually ruled in favor of the large video Sharing corporation and to be fair Matt Hoss doesn't have quite the same weight as Duke and media Regardless of what he thinks of himself my parents put me in pussy I've been a champion ever since and h3h3 do more than Ray William Johnson Whereas Johnson was more of a reporter even the healer are more commentators But one of the problems that makes h3h3 productions an easier time at the most commentary channels Is that they've always labeled themselves as a reaction channel and that makes them vulnerable to being tarred with the same brush with these other Channels that don't add anything on as a reaction is different to criticism Even though I and many others have always considered h3h3 a channel that builds greatly on the content that they look at I don't trust them to see the same picture and maybe that's just because I'm not very trusting person But there are a lot of idiots in the world and you never know where they're gonna be My main concern is that there's a court full of middle-aged people who don't have experience in this area And in a way you don't always expect people to have an understanding of such a situation But I think Inexperience lends a disadvantage to Ethan healer on these accounts that if I was brushing the surface you could say that they're not doing anything Transformative even though after watching many of their videos it's clear to me and many others They do most of these creators a favor by giving them extra exposure Ethan and healers content is not malign It's typically very casual very light-hearted and obviously as it's not as critical It does make them a soft target and exploiting that especially when the video was nothing personal is pretty reprehensible and the fact that Matt Hoss probably benefited of their initial video and then has the audacity to file a Fucking lawsuit probably with some of the money he made from that fucking exposure that video gave fucking disgusting And Ethan Nila have wasted copious amounts of money on lawyers just to maximize their chance and they did not have to do this They could have just settle with four thousand dollars passing over to that twat and we'd all be Fucking fucked by lawyers coming round like the fucking tax collectors asking us for money because we use their fucking videos this is about the community and I really hope they do win because they deserve to and everyone is in near Unanimous agreement that Matt Hoss is trying to ruin YouTube for everyone and I have a message for those like Matt Hoss Who want to tear down the foundations? There's so many have worked so hard and so look borously to put up that without it Your pathetic little channel probably wouldn't exist in the first place You won't even have a platform to perform your audacious publicity stunts But remember we are stronger than you so you can fucking pull the carpet from under our feet and we will get up again You can try to shackle us with your fucking Egocentrism, but we will break the chains You could plunge a stake through the heart of this community and we will pull every last splinter out because for every Narcissistic braggart like you there's a whole fan base willing to get behind Positive cause that won't necessarily benefit them but because it's right and if there's one thing I know about It's righteousness. I'm the right opinion And here's to fair use You", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 2.0, "text": " I hate to be a downer", "tokens": [50363, 314, 5465, 284, 307, 257, 866, 263, 50463], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.2822320749471476, "compression_ratio": 1.5, "no_speech_prob": 0.10117731988430023}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 7.4, "end": 12.58, "text": " Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the right opinion the home of a twat with too much free time and Matt Hoss", "tokens": [50733, 18435, 17308, 290, 28527, 11, 7062, 284, 262, 826, 4459, 262, 1363, 286, 257, 665, 265, 351, 1165, 881, 1479, 640, 290, 4705, 367, 793, 50992], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.2822320749471476, "compression_ratio": 1.5, "no_speech_prob": 0.10117731988430023}, {"id": 2, "seek": 0, "start": 12.88, "end": 14.3, "text": " What a scumbag", "tokens": [51007, 1867, 257, 629, 2178, 363, 51078], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.2822320749471476, "compression_ratio": 1.5, "no_speech_prob": 0.10117731988430023}, {"id": 3, "seek": 0, "start": 14.3, "end": 14.8, "text": " Yes", "tokens": [51078, 3363, 51103], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.2822320749471476, "compression_ratio": 1.5, "no_speech_prob": 0.10117731988430023}, {"id": 4, "seek": 0, "start": 14.8, "end": 21.56, "text": " The sheer amount of mental turmoil that he has put h2a3 over a single video has guaranteed him a special seat in hell", "tokens": [51103, 383, 15163, 2033, 286, 5110, 26962, 326, 339, 468, 1234, 289, 17, 64, 18, 625, 257, 2060, 2008, 468, 11462, 683, 257, 2041, 5852, 287, 5968, 51441], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.2822320749471476, "compression_ratio": 1.5, "no_speech_prob": 0.10117731988430023}, {"id": 5, "seek": 0, "start": 21.88, "end": 24.400000000000002, "text": " Regardless of what you think of their content", "tokens": [51457, 22250, 286, 644, 345, 892, 286, 511, 2695, 51583], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.2822320749471476, "compression_ratio": 1.5, "no_speech_prob": 0.10117731988430023}, {"id": 6, "seek": 0, "start": 24.400000000000002, "end": 25.88, "text": " Vape nation", "tokens": [51583, 569, 1758, 3277, 51657], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.2822320749471476, "compression_ratio": 1.5, "no_speech_prob": 0.10117731988430023}, {"id": 7, "seek": 2588, "start": 25.88, "end": 32.4, "text": " I genuinely cannot stand the man a selfish egomaniac whose videos were no better than mediocre in the first place", "tokens": [50363, 314, 17170, 2314, 1302, 262, 582, 257, 20363, 304, 19120, 3216, 330, 3025, 5861, 547, 645, 1365, 621, 29956, 287, 262, 717, 1295, 50689], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.17894422329538237, "compression_ratio": 1.636963696369637, "no_speech_prob": 0.014489538967609406}, {"id": 8, "seek": 2588, "start": 32.4, "end": 34.94, "text": " He recently announced the date of the supposed court hearing", "tokens": [50689, 679, 2904, 3414, 262, 3128, 286, 262, 4385, 2184, 4854, 50816], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.17894422329538237, "compression_ratio": 1.636963696369637, "no_speech_prob": 0.014489538967609406}, {"id": 9, "seek": 2588, "start": 34.94, "end": 38.92, "text": " I didn't watch the video as I didn't want to grant him that thousandth of a cent for the view", "tokens": [50816, 314, 1422, 470, 2342, 262, 2008, 355, 314, 1422, 470, 765, 284, 7264, 683, 326, 7319, 400, 286, 257, 1247, 329, 262, 1570, 51015], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.17894422329538237, "compression_ratio": 1.636963696369637, "no_speech_prob": 0.014489538967609406}, {"id": 10, "seek": 2588, "start": 38.92, "end": 43.44, "text": " I found it out.
