00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I hate to be a downer

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,580
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the right opinion the home of a twat with too much free time and Matt Hoss

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,300
What a scumbag

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:14,800
Yes

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:21,560
The sheer amount of mental turmoil that he has put h2a3 over a single video has guaranteed him a special seat in hell

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,400
Regardless of what you think of their content

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,880
Vape nation

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:32,400
I genuinely cannot stand the man a selfish egomaniac whose videos were no better than mediocre in the first place

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,940
He recently announced the date of the supposed court hearing

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,920
I didn't watch the video as I didn't want to grant him that thousandth of a cent for the view

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,440
I found it out. Otherwise, hopefully I think it's sometime in April, but I found that on reddit

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,160
So if I'm wrong, tell me I can be wrong on facts

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,640
Not opinions though, of course, but everyone's relatively confident, right? Right?

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not well not as much as I'd like to be at least you see we as a YouTube community know that this whole lawsuit

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,680
Is ridiculous and the video contained enough commentary to be described as constructive

16
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,640
We wouldn't watch Matt Hoss's video if Ethan and Hila hadn't provided their banterous remarks to add on to it

17
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,840
But we're not there to tell them that talking and we can't trust them to take Ethan's word on that

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,240
For example, they didn't believe Ray William Johnson when he went up against Duke and media and actually ruled in favor of the large video

19
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,080
Sharing corporation and to be fair Matt Hoss doesn't have quite the same weight as Duke and media

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,240
Regardless of what he thinks of himself my parents put me in pussy

21
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,120
I've been a champion ever since and h3h3 do more than Ray William Johnson

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,240
Whereas Johnson was more of a reporter even the healer are more commentators

23
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,960
But one of the problems that makes h3h3 productions an easier time at the most commentary channels

24
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:48,460
Is that they've always labeled themselves as a reaction channel and that makes them vulnerable to being tarred with the same brush with these other

25
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,060
Channels that don't add anything on as a reaction is different to criticism

26
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,180
Even though I and many others have always considered h3h3 a channel that builds greatly on the content that they look at

27
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,340
I don't trust them to see the same picture and maybe that's just because I'm not very trusting person

28
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,740
But there are a lot of idiots in the world and you never know where they're gonna be

29
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,540
My main concern is that there's a court full of middle-aged people who don't have experience in this area

30
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,600
And in a way you don't always expect people to have an understanding of such a situation

31
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,440
But I think

32
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:21,600
Inexperience lends a disadvantage to Ethan healer on these accounts that if I was brushing the surface you could say that they're not doing anything

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,280
Transformative even though after watching many of their videos it's clear to me and many others

34
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,320
They do most of these creators a favor by giving them extra exposure Ethan and healers content is not malign

35
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,220
It's typically very casual very light-hearted and obviously as it's not as critical

36
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:42,760
It does make them a soft target and exploiting that especially when the video was nothing personal is pretty

37
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,720
reprehensible and the fact that Matt Hoss probably benefited of their initial video and then has the audacity to file a

38
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:57,400
Fucking lawsuit probably with some of the money he made from that fucking exposure that video gave fucking disgusting

39
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:06,520
And Ethan Nila have wasted copious amounts of money on lawyers just to maximize their chance and they did not have to do this

40
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,480
They could have just settle with four thousand dollars passing over to that twat and we'd all be

41
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,640
Fucking fucked by lawyers coming round like the fucking tax collectors asking us for money because we use their fucking videos

42
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,280
this is about the community and I really hope they do win because they deserve to and everyone is in near

43
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:32,460
Unanimous agreement that Matt Hoss is trying to ruin YouTube for everyone and I have a message for those like Matt Hoss

44
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,220
Who want to tear down the foundations?

45
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,180
There's so many have worked so hard and so look borously to put up that without it

46
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,060
Your pathetic little channel probably wouldn't exist in the first place

47
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,520
You won't even have a platform to perform your audacious publicity stunts

48
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:56,580
But remember we are stronger than you so you can fucking pull the carpet from under our feet and we will get up again

49
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,940
You can try to shackle us with your fucking

50
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,160
Egocentrism, but we will break the chains

51
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,880
You could plunge a stake through the heart of this community and we will pull every last

52
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,540
splinter out because for every

53
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,620
Narcissistic braggart like you there's a whole fan base willing to get behind

54
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:23,640
Positive cause that won't necessarily benefit them but because it's right and if there's one thing I know about

55
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,160
It's righteousness. I'm the right opinion

56
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,680
And here's to fair use

57
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,880
You
