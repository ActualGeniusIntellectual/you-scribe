00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Genius or suicide?

00:07.440 --> 00:09.880
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the right opinion

00:09.880 --> 00:13.960
I hope you twat with too much free time and Trump sure does enjoy his Twitter charades

00:13.960 --> 00:20.000
And today I decide to take it upon myself to look at some of these charades of recent because at this point they are just

00:20.160 --> 00:23.400
unavoidable and I would not be doing my job as a critic of the bizarre and

00:23.660 --> 00:28.480
Entertaining if I were not to cover them. Donald Trump is the 45th president of the United States

00:28.480 --> 00:34.140
It has been a journey to his election and now after his election as we have noted a few times his very upfront

00:34.360 --> 00:36.720
Audacious attitude can be a virtue to voters

00:36.720 --> 00:39.760
It was certainly before the election and although I did not support him

00:39.760 --> 00:42.000
I saw his victory coming a mile away

00:42.000 --> 00:45.760
One of my problems with Donald Trump was that I just didn't think he had enough political

00:46.040 --> 00:49.600
Experience to uproot the system that he claimed he wanted to now in a sense

00:49.600 --> 00:52.560
It may have seemed like a better choice than going with Hillary Clinton

00:52.560 --> 00:57.560
So he knew the system and clearly had no intent to uproot it many people who were scorned by the establishment

00:57.560 --> 01:02.080
It seemed like a clear choice and I've spoken about my distaste of Hillary Clinton on multiple occasions

01:02.080 --> 01:05.400
So we will not be going down that rabbit hole again part of Trump success

01:05.400 --> 01:11.840
However did come from his rugged approach most importantly on social media where a wave of strongly targeted campaigns brought out results in certain

01:12.200 --> 01:18.220
Demographics notoriously central to this social media drive was Donald Trump's Twitter, which was pure unfiltered. Mr

01:18.220 --> 01:24.920
J Trump and would be used to gain more attention through his rather bullish statements that he made on the social media account rather than actual

01:25.240 --> 01:31.400
Diplomatic problems it seemed to mostly work with the media focusing on trivial stuff that people didn't really think about a few

01:31.400 --> 01:37.640
Breakthrough moments tore through Hillary Clinton's uninspired campaign and gave him the win with that said it was a tentative win

01:37.640 --> 01:42.000
And although he won on state he didn't win the popular vote. So he's always been walking on thin ice

01:42.000 --> 01:47.320
There were a few elections in 2017 and these were the ones that were gonna test his popularity

01:47.320 --> 01:49.240
How did it go and how did he respond?

01:49.240 --> 01:54.400
I mean he's kept up the whole persona since the last election and although that has worked on some levels particularly in

01:54.480 --> 02:01.800
distraction politics at controversial points is also muted a lot of public response and left a lot of people rather ambivalent now incumbent presidents

02:01.800 --> 02:05.640
Normally tend to perform worse on midterm elections and elections that are between them in

02:06.120 --> 02:11.760
2017 we had a few elections and the Republicans did not have a great showing but as I said that isn't a huge surprise

02:11.760 --> 02:18.340
But I did notice one thing afterwards Donald Trump has seemed to up the Twitter drama with some very diverse figures

02:18.340 --> 02:22.240
The first is North Korean president Kim Jong-un of the head of state

02:22.240 --> 02:25.720
Regarded to him as old Donald Trump took to his Twitter and when I read it

02:25.720 --> 02:31.200
I just sat there grinning wondering what was going on. I mean you can read it for yourself

02:31.200 --> 02:36.920
He pretty much deals a very passive-aggressive backhanded insults and says I could call him short and fat

02:36.920 --> 02:43.600
But I won't which basically means you are calling him short and fat and then he suggests that they could be friends just amazing

02:43.600 --> 02:49.360
I feel like Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump have this beef going which seems to be leading to a playground rap battle rather than all-out

02:49.520 --> 02:54.080
Nuclear war I mean all they do is shout insults at each other in the most immature fashion

02:54.080 --> 02:59.440
I trust there's a strategy behind it, but I'm not really sure at this point when Trump did the whole kafifi typo

02:59.440 --> 03:01.600
I thought it was a very effective distraction technique

03:01.600 --> 03:06.660
But it just keeps on happening and let us not forget the tale of Icarus who flew too close to the Sun

03:06.720 --> 03:13.240
What I think epitomized this was his even more bizarre feud with LeVar Ball when Donald Trump intervened in the arrest of three basketball players

03:13.560 --> 03:17.200
LeVar Ball the father of one of the players refused to thank Trump now

03:17.200 --> 03:21.400
If you've watched the interviews with LeVar Ball, you'll realize he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer

03:21.400 --> 03:25.360
This should have been a proverbial slam dunk for the president's back to Twitter

03:25.360 --> 03:31.000
He went and off on another rant about how he should have left the players in jail and amusing as this is it really makes

03:31.000 --> 03:37.960
me wonder what on earth is going on another golden moment was when he responded to an article made about him saying make America great again

03:37.960 --> 03:43.200
In all big caps lock and at this point, I'm just done. Is it that time of year two points can be made from this

03:43.200 --> 03:49.160
I feel that Trump is better at dealing with smart people than he is at dealing with stupid people and as bizarre as that sounds

03:49.160 --> 03:53.400
I genuinely stick by it. I think that he could have very easily dealt with LeVar Ball

03:53.400 --> 04:00.280
But for some reason he just felt it was more necessary to get down on this level and just throw the insults back

04:00.280 --> 04:01.440
Maybe he's got a plan

04:01.440 --> 04:06.240
but I don't know another point that can be made is that the aspects that are in part what propelled Trump to his

04:06.360 --> 04:10.080
Presidency or also the ones that becoming the most notorious part of his term

04:10.080 --> 04:14.700
I want to think it's some sort of elaborate flan, but I'm failing to see the bigger picture currently though

04:14.700 --> 04:21.400
I would love to hear some theories about it part of Trump's rhetoric that drove his straight-talking persona was the fiercely anti-establishment approach

04:21.400 --> 04:24.680
But now he's part of the establishment. Although he should hold on to his roots

04:24.680 --> 04:30.720
He does need to act slightly within his powers and avoid the Twitter issue becoming people's main concern because if you look at the polls

04:30.720 --> 04:34.320
When people are noting your Twitter as the most detracting aspect of you

04:34.320 --> 04:39.040
There's something not quite right it worked before the election because people didn't really care about it

04:39.040 --> 04:40.620
But if you make people care about the issue

04:40.620 --> 04:46.860
Then they may side against it and that would be ill-advised indeed if one thing has been proven in this term so far

04:46.860 --> 04:48.860
It's that you could have the most

04:48.860 --> 04:54.560
Bombastic ideologically skewed president and still end up with very little difference than if you had a moderate present

04:54.560 --> 05:00.240
It has demonstrated how immovable most of the DC swamp is and you really have to vote someone in with a balance of experience

05:00.400 --> 05:08.060
And principle to achieve that but unfortunately, they're normally exclusive disjunctions. Anyway, I'd really love to hear people's thoughts on good old. Mr

05:08.060 --> 05:10.500
Trump's Twitter has it worsened over the last couple months

05:10.500 --> 05:15.460
I mean it wasn't great before but you know what I'm saying, or do you simply believe once again?

05:15.460 --> 05:19.180
It is receiving more coverage. I love to hear your thoughts below until then

05:19.180 --> 05:21.760
I'm the right opinion and I'll see you in the next one
