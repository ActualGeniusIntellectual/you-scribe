0	2000	Genius or suicide?
7440	9880	Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the right opinion
9880	13960	I hope you twat with too much free time and Trump sure does enjoy his Twitter charades
13960	20000	And today I decide to take it upon myself to look at some of these charades of recent because at this point they are just
20160	23400	unavoidable and I would not be doing my job as a critic of the bizarre and
23660	28480	Entertaining if I were not to cover them. Donald Trump is the 45th president of the United States
28480	34140	It has been a journey to his election and now after his election as we have noted a few times his very upfront
34360	36720	Audacious attitude can be a virtue to voters
36720	39760	It was certainly before the election and although I did not support him
39760	42000	I saw his victory coming a mile away
42000	45760	One of my problems with Donald Trump was that I just didn't think he had enough political
46040	49600	Experience to uproot the system that he claimed he wanted to now in a sense
49600	52560	It may have seemed like a better choice than going with Hillary Clinton
52560	57560	So he knew the system and clearly had no intent to uproot it many people who were scorned by the establishment
57560	62080	It seemed like a clear choice and I've spoken about my distaste of Hillary Clinton on multiple occasions
62080	65400	So we will not be going down that rabbit hole again part of Trump success
65400	71840	However did come from his rugged approach most importantly on social media where a wave of strongly targeted campaigns brought out results in certain
72200	78220	Demographics notoriously central to this social media drive was Donald Trump's Twitter, which was pure unfiltered. Mr
78220	84920	J Trump and would be used to gain more attention through his rather bullish statements that he made on the social media account rather than actual
85240	91400	Diplomatic problems it seemed to mostly work with the media focusing on trivial stuff that people didn't really think about a few
91400	97640	Breakthrough moments tore through Hillary Clinton's uninspired campaign and gave him the win with that said it was a tentative win
97640	102000	And although he won on state he didn't win the popular vote. So he's always been walking on thin ice
102000	107320	There were a few elections in 2017 and these were the ones that were gonna test his popularity
107320	109240	How did it go and how did he respond?
109240	114400	I mean he's kept up the whole persona since the last election and although that has worked on some levels particularly in
114480	121800	distraction politics at controversial points is also muted a lot of public response and left a lot of people rather ambivalent now incumbent presidents
121800	125640	Normally tend to perform worse on midterm elections and elections that are between them in
126120	131760	2017 we had a few elections and the Republicans did not have a great showing but as I said that isn't a huge surprise
131760	138340	But I did notice one thing afterwards Donald Trump has seemed to up the Twitter drama with some very diverse figures
138340	142240	The first is North Korean president Kim Jong-un of the head of state
142240	145720	Regarded to him as old Donald Trump took to his Twitter and when I read it
145720	151200	I just sat there grinning wondering what was going on. I mean you can read it for yourself
151200	156920	He pretty much deals a very passive-aggressive backhanded insults and says I could call him short and fat
156920	163600	But I won't which basically means you are calling him short and fat and then he suggests that they could be friends just amazing
163600	169360	I feel like Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump have this beef going which seems to be leading to a playground rap battle rather than all-out
169520	174080	Nuclear war I mean all they do is shout insults at each other in the most immature fashion
174080	179440	I trust there's a strategy behind it, but I'm not really sure at this point when Trump did the whole kafifi typo
179440	181600	I thought it was a very effective distraction technique
181600	186660	But it just keeps on happening and let us not forget the tale of Icarus who flew too close to the Sun
186720	193240	What I think epitomized this was his even more bizarre feud with LeVar Ball when Donald Trump intervened in the arrest of three basketball players
193560	197200	LeVar Ball the father of one of the players refused to thank Trump now
197200	201400	If you've watched the interviews with LeVar Ball, you'll realize he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer
201400	205360	This should have been a proverbial slam dunk for the president's back to Twitter
205360	211000	He went and off on another rant about how he should have left the players in jail and amusing as this is it really makes
211000	217960	me wonder what on earth is going on another golden moment was when he responded to an article made about him saying make America great again
217960	223200	In all big caps lock and at this point, I'm just done. Is it that time of year two points can be made from this
223200	229160	I feel that Trump is better at dealing with smart people than he is at dealing with stupid people and as bizarre as that sounds
229160	233400	I genuinely stick by it. I think that he could have very easily dealt with LeVar Ball
233400	240280	But for some reason he just felt it was more necessary to get down on this level and just throw the insults back
240280	241440	Maybe he's got a plan
241440	246240	but I don't know another point that can be made is that the aspects that are in part what propelled Trump to his
246360	250080	Presidency or also the ones that becoming the most notorious part of his term
250080	254700	I want to think it's some sort of elaborate flan, but I'm failing to see the bigger picture currently though
254700	261400	I would love to hear some theories about it part of Trump's rhetoric that drove his straight-talking persona was the fiercely anti-establishment approach
261400	264680	But now he's part of the establishment. Although he should hold on to his roots
264680	270720	He does need to act slightly within his powers and avoid the Twitter issue becoming people's main concern because if you look at the polls
270720	274320	When people are noting your Twitter as the most detracting aspect of you
274320	279040	There's something not quite right it worked before the election because people didn't really care about it
279040	280620	But if you make people care about the issue
280620	286860	Then they may side against it and that would be ill-advised indeed if one thing has been proven in this term so far
286860	288860	It's that you could have the most
288860	294560	Bombastic ideologically skewed president and still end up with very little difference than if you had a moderate present
294560	300240	It has demonstrated how immovable most of the DC swamp is and you really have to vote someone in with a balance of experience
300400	308060	And principle to achieve that but unfortunately, they're normally exclusive disjunctions. Anyway, I'd really love to hear people's thoughts on good old. Mr
308060	310500	Trump's Twitter has it worsened over the last couple months
310500	315460	I mean it wasn't great before but you know what I'm saying, or do you simply believe once again?
315460	319180	It is receiving more coverage. I love to hear your thoughts below until then
319180	321760	I'm the right opinion and I'll see you in the next one
