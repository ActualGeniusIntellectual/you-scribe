0	8680	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,
8680	12440	and there are many ways that celebrities may immortalise themselves in popular culture,
12440	17680	maybe they pioneered a defining industry, maybe they released a series of critically acclaimed albums,
17680	24560	or maybe they died young. I know that was a bit of an abrupt segue, but there is a morbid fascination we have
24560	28360	with celebrities who didn't necessarily bow out in the most graceful fashion,
28400	33640	when someone with such great potential and apparent success is victim to the tragedy of a premature demise,
33640	38560	particularly those of artificial sorts, we're left thinking about what might have been for that individual,
38560	42760	and we're also encouraged to reflect on the industry that may have manufactured such an outcome.
42760	47480	Now make no mistake, some of these individuals were incredibly prolific regardless of their depth,
47480	51880	and you don't want to overstate their depth as if to take away from their artistic contribution,
51880	55880	but when someone passes away, that contribution is often frozen in that moment,
55880	60440	and we are drawn to the attention of what that death has taken away from us as individuals.
60440	65080	A really great example of that was Stefan Karl Steffensen, the guy who played Robbie Rotten,
65080	69320	and provided me and many others with the numerous memes that yielded from We Are Number One.
69320	76200	His diagnosis, recovery, relapse, and eventual death was an emotional rollercoaster that many people were on all the way,
76200	80200	but his death reflected something else. Because we were there throughout the situation,
80200	85080	we had time to provide our support to someone we loved. Popular individuals dying prematurely
85080	91080	is not the most common event, and often what is even rarer is being able to foresee the possibility of that death,
91080	97400	as many people don't go public about it, and therefore the journey to that destination is often a fight we want to be there for.
97400	102280	There's an emotional battle that gives us purpose, to know that we might make a difference in that battle.
102280	107640	Therefore, it was natural that when people found out that today's subjects were dying, they wanted to show their support.
107640	112360	Who are those subjects? Well, they are a pair of YouTubers by the name of Xtreme Games,
112360	119240	the Australian brothers of Thomas and Jonathan, who do what you want to see, have fun, play games, and chill.
119240	124120	They describe their content as family friendly, and kid friendly, and in their five years on YouTube,
124120	130440	they've built up a fairly sturdy subscriber count of 4.24 million, and over 314 million views.
130440	136200	Pretty impressive. Where did those views come from? Well, who remembers Pro Gamer Jay? No one?
136200	141240	Well, let me refresh your memory. A couple years back, he was the punching bag for many commentators
141240	147320	who found his content a bit, well, laughable. He was notorious for rather misleading, albeit amusing, clickbait.
147320	152920	His most well known was a video that was titled, If You See Red Then You Are Colorblind, or Words To That Effect,
152920	157080	as he has changed it since then, the cheeky bugger. However, although many people picked on him,
157080	162120	maybe due to his delivery, he was part of a greater trend that was represented by multiple creators,
162120	167080	even to this day, that rated the power of leading your audience to believe that they were doing something
167080	170360	with higher stakes than what actually happened in the video.
170360	174360	Now, with that said, a lot of these channels specialised in various areas of clickbait.
174360	178840	There was obviously a significant amount of overlap, but they all occupied various corners.
178840	183560	Honestly, these videos should have died out much faster than they did, but some have, in fact, persisted.
183560	188120	The ones who have either grew into the creative maestros, such as Mr. Beast, who actually followed through
188120	194040	on their clickbaits, or a level of uninspired irony that I and other audiences appear still to be attempting
194040	196840	to understand, such as Mork's.
196840	204760	Guys, I'm so close, but I'm just not sure what the item is. What could come after B-O-O?
204760	212360	Wait a minute! Book! I guessed the letter K! Guys, what could that final letter be?
212360	216760	A math book! A mal book! A mad book! A mad book!
216760	221560	However, many of these creators also lost a lot of traction, with the introduction of corporate channels
221560	226120	like Brightside, who can just pump out these dire informational videos on a regular basis.
226120	230680	Many individual creators realised that they couldn't compete, and only channels who were doing things
230680	233640	that weren't just based on clickbait managed to survive.
233640	238760	Extreme Games were one of the channels that appeared to have gained most of their prominence off this trend initially.
238760	243800	Although they clearly had some presence prior to two years ago, this is the only content that really is still
243800	247880	accessible on their channel. In fact, one of the things that I found while researching their videos
247880	251000	is that they removed them at an unbelievably high rate.
251000	257000	However, like many channels around this time, Extreme Games were the victim to the demise of that brand of content.
257000	264200	Extreme Games at their peak seemed to specialise in Nerf gun mods, DIY fidget spinners, and DIY Nerf guns.
264200	267720	Basically mixing and matching various trends at that point.
267720	271880	Now, there's been worse clickbait to be honest, but it became very clear that people were not going to be won over
271880	276920	by the concept of lava fidget spinners forever, and eventually their views began to fall.
276920	280360	Like many channels that coasted on the clickbait rather than the content,
280360	283240	people did not stick around when those topics lost their charm.
283240	286600	It didn't help that they were not the most charismatic of individuals.
286600	289720	That is literally an apple fidget spinner.
289720	292920	Oh man! We just made a fidget spinner out of an apple!
292920	295640	And the cool thing is, if you're hungry, you can just take a bite from it.
295640	298600	Who would have honestly thought that, ever? That is so cool.
298600	302520	Basically, they just couldn't maintain the brilliant momentum that they once had.
302520	305640	However, on the horizon, something much more sinister was brewing.
305640	309800	A tragedy about to befall both characters involved in this compelling tale.
309800	314600	They were going to face down a challenge much worse than a dead channel, death itself.
318920	320040	This is the end.
320040	324440	They were in the fight for their life, and their fanbase was right behind them.
324440	327960	They needed that support more desperately than anything they needed before.
327960	332360	The tale was of two brothers who were facing down their own life-threatening illnesses.
332360	336680	Jonathan suffering from a kidney problem, and Thomas suffering from severe vertigo.
336680	339800	However, very soon, a few voices of skepticism arose,
339800	342680	that stated that not everything was as it seems.
343800	347320	Now, as far as making shitty clickbaity content goes, I could care less.
347320	350680	I mean, there's millions of people that do this on the internet, and I say get that money.
350680	351640	More power to you.
353240	356600	But the second you start pretending you're dying in order to get clicks and views
356600	359800	after your channel's kind of suffering and not performing as well as it used to,
359800	363080	well, that's when I start to just raise a little eyebrow at it.
363880	367080	Join me today as I look into the story of Extreme Games,
367080	371080	and what led them to one of the most bizarre creator meltdowns in the last year,
371080	373960	and see if we can diagnose the real problem.
373960	375000	Are you ready?
375000	375560	Good.
375560	376600	I know I am.
376600	378120	Let us commence.
389800	394760	4.2 Million Subscribers
394760	400120	A channel that has 4.2 million subscribers, they couldn't have obtained that overnight.
400120	401080	Well, they didn't.
401080	404520	In spite of the fact that most of their content wasn't online anymore,
404520	408920	I have been able to create a somewhat accurate timeline of the progress of their channel,
408920	411080	and what it says about them as creators.
411080	415160	It's quite incredible, actually, the lack of public record of their content,
415160	417880	despite the monumental statistics.
417880	421000	The actual documented content is rather scarce.
421000	424600	One of the things that I found was that no one seemed to screenshot their content,
424600	427480	and that made it very hard to find archived versions.
427480	431480	In fact, this video would not exist if it hadn't been for Leon Lush's archivings
431480	436360	of their videos about their illnesses, so I wanted to extend my sincerest gratitude to him.
436360	439160	However, fortunately, because I am a tenacious bastard,
439160	442920	the one thing that Extreme Games did not do was clear their Twitter history,
442920	445480	and this is where it becomes quite spicy.
445480	446440	Now, what do we know?
446440	451480	We know that Extreme Games were formed in around 2014, mid 2014.
451480	454040	Now, we don't know exactly what they were doing back then,
454040	456920	however, unfortunately, their Twitter is pretty much untouched,
456920	459320	so we know the sort of content that they were tweeting.
459320	463880	Now, I want to have a quick trivia game, because you all know how much I love quizzes.
463880	465400	Today's million pound question is,
465400	469800	what sort of channel did Extreme Games brand themselves as in 2015?
469800	475000	Your options are a Clash of Clans gaming channel, or a free giveaway channel.
475960	479720	If you answered A or B, you'd only be half right, because it was both.
479720	482680	In fact, they'd really love to tell you that they were doing free giveaways
482680	484680	for Clash of Clans accounts.
484680	488040	I really do feel bad for anyone who was tagged in their insipid tweets,
488040	490360	telling them to make sure they like and subscribe,
490360	493800	so they're in with a chance to win an epic Clash of Clans account.
493800	497560	However, maybe they did have a legitimate passion for this Clash of Clans content,
497560	499800	because in rare footage of them with Banks plays,
499800	503240	they informed the audience that they were actually top ten at one point.
505000	509080	And so these guys right here are pretty much badasses at Clash Royale,
509080	511000	are they what y'all are number ten in the world at some point?
511000	514920	Yes, yes, we were at some point, but we're still pretty high up there at the moment.
514920	518680	Now, honestly, she seems more convinced than they do about this fun fact,
518680	522200	but I don't know, it looks like they did reach the top 50 at a stage,
522200	524520	so hey, it's not impossible.
524520	528440	After all, why wouldn't I trust these Extreme Gamers?
528440	529480	Looking at their other tweets,
529480	532840	they also said hello to some people with a couple of replies,
532840	535080	very productive conversation.
535080	539720	Honestly, I can't imagine what living this life would be like just tweeting at people,
539720	545480	but hey, they were young, probably around 16 and 17, 18,
545480	548280	and they were at that stage where they could learn and grow.
548280	550280	So how did they evolve in the coming years?
551320	555480	Well, it seems after hitting a few subscriber milestones, they spanned out.
555480	560200	They did some different games with giveaways, they did some prank calls with giveaways.
560200	562440	Honestly, they seemed to enjoy their giveaways.
562440	564440	Even when they were making different content,
564440	567080	they were still integrated with the giveaways.
567080	570840	They also had what must have been the shortest Shoutout Sunday series,
570840	576600	running from the 23rd of February 2016 to the 23rd of February 2016.
576600	579000	I hope that someone got their shoutout.
579000	583000	Ultimately, their mentality represented a time where people were just so obsessed
583000	586280	with subscriber counts, and the short-term gain that could be obtained
586280	588280	by having a nice number next to your name,
588280	590760	that was more valued than actually constructing a channel
590760	592360	for which people would stick around for.
592360	594520	Most of these giveaways were presented with the commitment
594520	596920	that you needed to like and subscribe to the channel.
596920	600360	Now, beyond the fact that a person could not see who has liked their videos
600360	603240	unless they went on their channel and looked at their playlists,
603240	606040	and they would have to have a public playlist of liked videos,
606040	608360	it's also the same pretty much with subscriptions.
608360	610520	They would have to have their subscriptions public.
610520	614280	They could, in all fairness, look at who subscribed to them in their subscriber list.
614280	617080	However, that's only people who make their subscriptions public.
617080	620760	At this stage, a fair majority of giveaways were absolute codswallop,
620760	623880	and although I cannot comment on the legitimacy of the specific ones,
623880	625320	I highly doubt they were real.
625320	628360	Given that I highly doubt they were making much money when they started,
628360	632120	the volume of these giveaways was such that unless they were already oil barons,
632120	633880	I highly doubt they have the budget.
633880	637480	With that said, at the start there were a fair few people who did claim to win,
637480	641000	and they did seem to announce winners as well, even in later videos,
641000	644680	although once again my point about their flawed methodology still persists,
644680	647640	and just because there were some winners or some announced winners
647640	650520	doesn't mean that every single giveaway was legitimate.
650520	652680	There may be people who have claimed to give away things to winners,
652680	654200	but that would not be the case.
654200	656680	They also did some streaming on camcorder this time,
656680	660600	but that site's defunct, so that's another one lost to the vaults unfortunately.
660600	664840	Now with that said, given the topic, and given their competence with the topic,
664840	669080	they did acquire a sturdy fanbase, however it clearly wasn't good enough for them.
669080	672200	The pool audience for Clash of Clans is pretty restricted.
672200	676360	There are some popular channels, but you're not gonna have a plethora of them,
676360	678600	and with gamers as extreme as Tom and John,
678600	683160	they knew they could easily adapt with the changing environment, so they did.
683160	687000	But what was the big thing at the time around 2016?
687000	690040	Well it was Pokemon Go, so what did they do?
690040	694200	They rebranded to Extreme Games Pokemon Go,
694200	695960	that was literally the name of their channel,
695960	699000	and quickly began to churn out content catered to that audience,
699000	702440	of which back in 2016, there was a lot of desire for.
702440	705800	There was hesitant success when they started this content in July,
705800	710120	but by August, they were attaining subscribers at a rate not seen before.
710120	714200	What I assume made their content particularly successful alongside the topic choice,
714200	715880	was the giveaways.
716600	717800	And it's gonna be amazing.
717800	719080	Before we get into this video guys,
719080	722280	we wanna quickly run you through our huge giveaways that we're doing guys.
722280	726840	The first step to enter our Pokemon Go level 30 account giveaways is guys,
726840	728600	you gotta like this video.
728600	730760	We're trying to hit 10,000 likes on this video,
730760	733320	so every single person watching this video,
733320	735400	go down below and smash that like button,
735400	738440	it is one of the biggest steps to enter into this giveaway.
738440	742840	Giveaways back then were basically pasted at the start of videos by these creators.
742840	747160	What this would do is catch audiences who may not otherwise watch the whole video,
747160	748840	and persuade them to subscribe,
748840	750920	so that in the future when you upload it,
750920	754120	there would be a higher probability of them viewing your content.
754120	757640	At first, I didn't think this observation was particularly consequential,
757640	761000	however, I do want you to keep this in mind for their future content.
761000	762760	Combined with already high viewership,
762760	765400	this turned over a high subscriber rate for the lads,
765400	769880	and by the end of 2016, they hit 200,000 subscribers.
769880	773400	At first, it seemed bizarre to me that people would inundate their audience
773400	774840	with that level of giveaways,
774840	776040	they're obviously not real,
776040	780040	and all you're doing is creating a load of dormant subscribers who will desert you.
780040	781480	But then it hit me,
781480	782680	and it hit me hard.
788440	791480	Extreme Games ran a very interesting project on the surface,
791480	793880	because they weren't just empty shells of people,
793880	797240	they clearly have souls, and activities that they enjoy.
797240	800200	However, they were also rather unexceptional in their personality,
800200	802280	if someone was asked what made their content,
802280	804520	they would probably hesitate to provide an answer.
804520	808120	Because at first, the giveaways seemed to just be a vacuous inclusion
808120	809560	to increase subscriber count,
809560	810360	which they are,
810360	812840	let me emphasise that, of course, cannot be ignored.
812840	814200	However, after some brooding,
814200	817000	I came to the conclusion that it was actually the giveaways
817000	819560	that also gave them such a staying power.
819560	822120	Creators like Derv were only known for their giveaways,
822120	825880	because otherwise, their content provided nothing really of additional value.
825880	830280	With Extreme Games, their videos were mediocre, even tolerable at points.
830280	833880	This ultimately meant that if people had an additional reason to watch their content,
833880	837480	they normally would if it covered something that might have appealed to their interest.
837480	840760	At the same time, they could enter whatever definitely legitimate giveaway
840760	842040	the YouTuber was hosting,
842040	844280	and provide them with the view that they desired.
844280	845880	On top of this, the fact that Extreme Games
845880	849240	always said they would announce the winner in future videos
849240	852120	gave people a greater desire to watch those future videos
852120	854120	to see if they could find out if they had won.
854120	856440	So when they were making these Pokemon videos that were,
856440	859320	from my perspective, equatable to FIFA opening packs,
859320	861800	people would just find mild amusement from the content,
861800	863480	and then continue with their day.
863480	867080	This also allowed the brothers to change genre of content fairly easily,
867080	868520	because although clearly existent,
868520	871240	there wasn't an intense topic loyalty to what they covered.
871240	874520	This meant that although they had created over 200,000 subscribers
874520	876200	from Pokemon related content,
876200	880440	a number that many Pokemon creators would never consider changing their content for,
880440	883400	in the extreme world, it was rather elementary.
883400	886680	They continued their Pokemon content well into 2017,
886680	890520	however at around February time, they started to seemingly mix it up a little.
890520	894040	One of the first videos that appears to have been a real benchmark for this change
894040	899400	was another private video called $1 Cake vs $870 Cake.
899400	902760	At this point, they appeared to begin integrating some new types of videos,
902760	905400	ones that didn't focus around just Pokemon.
905400	910040	That's beginning the segue to eventually completely phase out Pokemon content altogether.
910040	914440	The other video that I really want to note is one called How I Almost Died.
914440	915480	Let's have a quick watch.
916440	918200	I take these every single day.
918200	921640	Now if you want to know why, make sure you watch this video all the way through,
921640	925080	and I will tell you why all these tablets need to be taken daily.
925080	927640	Before we get into this video guys, I want to quickly tell you guys,
927640	932040	we are holding some humongous giveaways, iTunes cards, Google Play cards,
932040	933080	and much more.
933080	934680	Oh, another giveaway.
934680	938520	So basically, in this video, they describe Jonathan's dice with death,
938520	941720	and how it affected them, over suitably emotional music.
941720	945720	So the kidney disease specialists actually checked my urine,
945720	949320	and checked that there was actually a lot of protein in my urine,
949320	952600	and actually a lot of blood in my urine, which are two bad things.
952600	956200	You don't want to have either of those in your urine, obviously.
956200	957800	But yeah, to those two bad things.
957800	958920	So they gave me three options.
958920	962440	They said option number one is you can get on Predicinal,
962440	967240	which is a tablet that like, really, I'll tell you guys a bit later,
967240	968520	really is bad for you.
968520	970680	Then there is another option where we could do nothing.
971800	972840	That's one of the options.
972840	976840	And then the third option was get a kidney biopsy to see exactly what I have.
977480	981000	It appears that Jonathan had a kidney condition that caused various symptoms,
981000	982680	and led him to be hospitalized.
982680	986040	I can't necessarily completely comment on the validity of the story.
986040	988760	What I can comment on is that it gave them two things.
989720	992280	A lot of views, and a lot of very sympathetic comments from individuals
992280	993960	who identified with that struggle.
993960	998440	A struggle that doesn't come easily, and a struggle often harder to open up about.
998440	1001080	Although the piano was a rather heavy-handed measure,
1001080	1004600	many were prepared to look past it and see the humanity in the message,
1004600	1006280	and to witness that struggle.
1006280	1008760	Now as said, I'm not one to doubt this story.
1008760	1011240	The medicine that he's taking all checks out,
1011240	1013960	and he seems to have reasonable knowledge of the condition,
1013960	1017560	though it does enter suspicious territory at certain points.
1018440	1020200	He's not going to tell you the actual story.
1020200	1021480	I'll tell you the actual story.
1022920	1025480	That's not the crazy part, because normally people would be like,
1025480	1028040	okay, you can't see it, so you can't feel it, right?
1028040	1030440	They put in a drug, they numb your back.
1031080	1032680	This is the crazy part.
1032680	1036120	Johnny here didn't get any numbing anything.
1036120	1040040	So pretty much, he felt getting stabbed in the back multiple times.
1041240	1044440	He didn't get any of the numbing drugs to get to numb his back.
1044440	1045480	He wasn't asleep.
1045480	1046520	He wasn't anything.
1046520	1047960	He was just under there.
1047960	1049560	And the doctor, when he came out, he said,
1050200	1052120	this kid is the strongest kid I've ever seen.
1052120	1059240	He said, I've seen fully grown adults do this with being numbed and still cry.
1059240	1062600	And he did it without being numbed, and he was only, what, 15 at the time.
1062600	1065560	I'd personally be quite surprised if doctors were allowed to operate
1065560	1068280	on someone without any anaesthetic administered,
1068280	1069960	and I'm still not sure why.
1069960	1071320	But hey, I digress.
1071320	1074040	Maybe he is just an extremely strong lad.
1074040	1076600	There are some other interesting points, such as the information
1076600	1080040	that membranous nephropathy is typically found in older adults,
1080040	1083160	and theory that maybe he took this story from a relative I'm sure
1083160	1087240	has bounced around in people's minds, but that was too cynical for me.
1087240	1090280	As said, there are sides to this story that seem to add up.
1090280	1093560	So yes, this video received a lot of positive feedback and support
1093560	1095080	from many people within the community,
1095080	1097400	and it was also a video that came out just before
1097400	1099960	a very successful run of uploads for the brothers.
1099960	1101560	How consistently successful?
1101560	1105960	Well, I can't say, because for I know they've unlisted all the poorly performing ones.
1105960	1109080	However, the ones that did do well, did very well.
1109080	1111480	We're not just talking about 1 or 2 million views a video,
1111480	1113720	we're talking 10 million plus videos.
1113720	1118040	These videos were an eventual transition out of the Pokemon related content,
1118040	1120520	and represented a move to content more general.
1120520	1122520	Many channels couldn't make this transition,
1122520	1124600	but there were two factors that eased this.
1124600	1126360	The first one we spoke about earlier.
1126360	1128760	The other factor that was important to note was that
1128760	1133160	this new type of content didn't necessarily alienate those who subscribed for Pokemon.
1133160	1136200	Many people have been easily pulled in by these types of videos,
1136200	1137480	they have a general appeal,
1137480	1141640	they weren't necessarily moving from Pokemon to another specific game,
1141640	1145800	they were moving to a more broad genre that could still catch a viewer's attention,
1145800	1147640	regardless of that viewer's interests.
1147640	1150440	In the moment, doing this made them incredibly successful,
1150440	1153160	but they also took a critical hit to their staying power.
1153160	1155240	Back when they made videos on specific games,
1155240	1157160	they had the reassurance that their content
1157160	1160120	was likely always going to appeal to a certain audience.
1160120	1162280	This venture was like searching for treasure,
1162280	1164600	it was either incredible amounts of success,
1164600	1165960	or no success at all,
1165960	1168200	but when you keep looting the same island,
1168200	1170040	the returns become diminished,
1170040	1172040	and if you have no other islands to loot,
1172040	1175880	then the voyages become repeatedly less and less fortuitous,
1175880	1179720	and suddenly, all those previous voyages just don't seem so successful.
1179720	1181000	How could that happen?
1181000	1181960	Let's have a chat.
1187560	1191320	Many of us have an understanding of what might make an audience view our content,
1191320	1194040	typically the main aim is to keep people coming back.
1194040	1196600	A subscription is an important component of that,
1196600	1199880	because it shows a commitment that will subsequently have a knock-on effect
1199880	1203240	on the frequency that the individual sees our content in their feed,
1203240	1205240	however it's still only half the story.
1205240	1208120	I feel the lads over at Extreme Games did understand that,
1208120	1211320	and tried to use the anticipation yielded by multiple giveaways
1211320	1214040	to have people stick around longer than they normally would.
1214040	1216600	However, it was a fickle sense of brand loyalty,
1216600	1219400	mainly because people become impatient when they don't win,
1219400	1222440	and even if they were legitimately picking winners of these giveaways,
1222440	1226680	the chances of winning became much lower the larger their channel became.
1226680	1230760	By gaining subscribers from this method, they undermined their own appeal.
1230760	1233640	The idea of giveaways are a nice inclusion here and there,
1233640	1236840	but unless everyone legitimately believes they have a chance of winning,
1236840	1241960	the subscribers and views that it provides is never substantial enough to justify the technique,
1241960	1244440	mainly because many creators also understand
1244440	1247880	that you need to have people invested in your content for the long term,
1247880	1252360	they need to be invested in a part of you, the creator, which can be relied on.
1252360	1257640	Giveaways can't be relied on by the viewer, because they are almost completely chance-based.
1257640	1261000	At the time for Tom and John, it may have been hard for them to notice this,
1261000	1263720	behind the absolutely monumental views,
1263720	1266200	but they were setting up a channel that would not survive,
1266200	1269320	their move to broad topics made them vulnerable to a changing of the tide
1269320	1271080	with no real hook on the content,
1271080	1274680	and their giveaways were undermined by the colossal size of the viewership
1274680	1276680	and the alienation that came with that.
1276680	1278760	Eventually the views began to dwindle.
1278760	1283400	Once again, I can't exactly calculate the point where they drop below a reasonable threshold,
1283400	1286360	because they've removed a majority of the unsuccessful videos,
1286360	1290600	but you can see a clear trend in the ones that the brothers deem worthy to remain.
1290600	1292600	With the gradual decline of their views,
1292600	1296120	it appeared that there was no real way to switch up at this point,
1296120	1299560	as mentioned, to survive the evolving environment of these types of videos,
1299560	1302680	you either have to be accompanied with an abnormally high output rate,
1302680	1305880	or have something genuinely unique about your personality,
1305880	1307880	or the way that you conduct your content,
1307880	1310520	and that's something Extreme Games just did not have.
1310520	1313880	However, they did have one more character to introduce to this story,
1313880	1315320	and that was Jesus.
1316680	1319880	Now, the brothers had always been fond of their festivities,
1319880	1323160	however, on October 29th 2017,
1323160	1324360	the lads tweeted out that,
1324360	1331560	Now, as you probably know, I am not a man of faith,
1331560	1335720	however, I take no issue with anyone who finds solace within the bounds of religion.
1335720	1339960	Nonetheless, it did seem like a sudden wave of found faith that caught me off guard.
1339960	1341960	After this initial tweet, to be fair to them,
1341960	1344840	they did follow through with this commitment to Jesus Christ,
1344840	1347160	as shown by their Twitter and Instagram.
1347160	1349000	Guys, it's time for the bible verse of the day.
1349000	1350360	Johnny, what is it?
1350360	1352760	It is, in your relationships with one another,
1352760	1355560	have the same mindset as Jesus Christ.
1355560	1357320	That is the verse meaning pretty much,
1357320	1359320	what Jesus Christ does is he loves everyone,
1359320	1362200	and he cares for everyone, he wants the best for everyone.
1362200	1363400	So that's what he's saying,
1363400	1366040	in your mindset with one another, with your friends, with your family,
1366040	1368120	with anyone, just a random person on the street,
1368120	1370280	have that same mindset, have that same love,
1370280	1373000	have that same passion for everyone you meet,
1373000	1374920	and everything will be really awesome,
1374920	1376600	you'll always have a good feeling in your heart.
1377160	1379560	So that was Philippines chapter 2 verse 5,
1379560	1380760	we love you all so much,
1380760	1383720	and honestly guys, you guys have been giving us some really good comments,
1383720	1385080	and some great feedback,
1385080	1386600	we love you guys so much,
1386600	1388360	have an awesome day, have an awesome night,
1388360	1390120	and we'll speak to you guys again tomorrow.
1390120	1390440	Peace!
1391240	1392600	That's all well and good,
1392600	1396040	but I think it's pronounced Philippians rather than Philippines,
1396040	1399240	there's a difference between the sovereign state and the New Testament book.
1399240	1400840	Anyhow, pronunciation aside,
1400840	1404040	their commitment to Jesus Christ without necessary explanation
1404040	1405560	certainly came as a surprise,
1405560	1408440	but hey, maybe they were always passionate about Christ,
1408440	1411960	and just felt they could be more open about it with their audience.
1411960	1413960	After all, who am I to take it away from them?
1413960	1416280	However, there was one thing bouncing around in my head
1416280	1418360	that just left me with a lingering suspicion.
1418360	1421160	Although many find positive meaning in Christianity,
1421160	1424440	there is a darker side to the idea of organised religion.
1424440	1427720	Because its validity relies on one's own perception of belief,
1427720	1430920	there are a lot of individuals who will use this element of Christianity,
1430920	1432680	and the connection that they have with it,
1432680	1434680	as an element of binding loyalty.
1434680	1436840	This has been most often observed with maybe
1436840	1439080	some of the more celebrity American preachers,
1439080	1441720	some of whom have been exposed for preaching modesty
1441720	1444760	while indulging in fairly lavish behaviours themselves.
1444760	1448280	What happens is that basically people promote themselves as so holy
1448280	1450680	that people must think that they can do no wrong,
1450680	1453720	and then when they commit wrong, and some people may call them out,
1453720	1458440	they use the notion of Christianity to frame themselves as being unfairly persecuted.
1458440	1461960	Now I highly doubt the lads were necessarily looking at it from that perspective,
1461960	1463000	but one of these genres,
1463080	1467080	there does seem to be a real lack of strongly Christian individuals, is YouTube.
1467080	1469560	I'm not referring to softly spiritual individuals,
1469560	1472440	or even people who may identify with the Christian religion,
1472440	1475720	but those who preach it with the sort of fervour that these lads do.
1475720	1478920	Some people in this genre even receive a decent amount of stigma,
1478920	1481640	and some of that, I'd argue, is hard to justify.
1481640	1483720	I don't know why the lads made this sudden change,
1483720	1485640	but honestly, it felt out of place.
1485640	1488040	Not because I don't think you can be Christian on concept,
1488040	1491320	but because I didn't feel it fit into the way that they behaved.
1491320	1492920	And you know, maybe that's just me,
1492920	1496680	but I guess I don't see the preaching of deep Christian principles
1496680	1500040	as completely congruent with the content that they viewed as marketable,
1500040	1502920	and maybe that's my more judgmental side coming into play.
1502920	1506440	I know there's nothing specifically in the Bible about clickbaits.
1506440	1507960	Ultimately, when going through the stage,
1507960	1509720	although I have my own personal feelings,
1509720	1512600	if Christianity is something that they want to promote to their audience,
1512600	1513880	then that is fair enough.
1513880	1518360	They did start promoting Christianity as a concept before their overwhelming success,
1518360	1520840	even if it was just with the occasional tweets.
1520840	1526120	The actual Instagram videos that I showed you there were from around February in 2018,
1526120	1530360	which was just under a month after they had their last multi-million view video,
1530360	1532200	the 24 hour escape room.
1532520	1533080	No way!
1533880	1535400	Don't do that!
1535400	1536360	And you know what?
1536360	1538440	This tape is impenetrable.
1538440	1538840	What?
1538840	1539960	You don't believe that?
1539960	1540600	You know what that means?
1540600	1541000	What?
1541000	1542360	You can't break it.
1542360	1543560	I don't believe that.
1543560	1544360	Well, believe it.
1545400	1546760	I don't believe that.
1546760	1548520	I'm gonna break out, you know that, right?
1548520	1549240	Believe it.
1549240	1549800	I'm hungry!
1550360	1551800	It's lunch time and I haven't eaten!
1552440	1553320	Are you gonna get me some food?
1553320	1555160	You should have thought of that before you tried to run the joint.
1555160	1556360	Let me see if this stuff's real.
1557720	1558440	Rip fruit.
1559240	1563080	I'd asked how these videos received so many likes,
1563080	1567000	but then I realised that there was another giveaway at the start, so who cares?
1567000	1569240	However, there was a lingering suspicion that to me,
1569240	1572440	there was a deeper meaning to their Christianity,
1572440	1574600	and that was about to be exercised.
1588440	1598440	The thing is, whether the lads were genuinely Christian or not,
1598440	1599560	and they may well be,
1599560	1604120	there is a unique appeal to be a YouTuber who openly preaches their belief in God.
1604120	1607000	Once again, it promotes a level of loyalty.
1607000	1610680	In a way to me, it seemed like a reformulated approach of the giveaways,
1610680	1612920	it was a way to increase people's commitment to you
1612920	1616520	without offering anything additional value in the actual content,
1616520	1620040	because honestly, this is not really what I consider high quality.
1627640	1631400	Now with that said, there are many risks to promoting a specific religious doctrine.
1631400	1634200	You may alienate significant portions of your audience,
1634200	1637720	those who may identify with other religions or no religion at all.
1637720	1640360	However, it's important to note that the preaching that we observe
1640360	1643320	was pretty much confined to their Instagram and Twitter,
1643320	1646440	which is where you'd find their more committed audience anyway.
1646440	1648280	I feel this was a tactical decision,
1648280	1652520	as they were aware of the risk that inserting that into every video would ensue.
1652520	1655400	To me, it seemed like a way to try and gain a commitment from fans
1655400	1659160	who sought out their personas more passionately than the surface level audience.
1660280	1662200	I don't know if the brothers understand this,
1662200	1666520	but a key part of videos performing well is click-through rate, also known as CTR.
1666520	1669480	Now the problem is that if you have a large, dead channel,
1669480	1672280	the audiences may be advertised a video when you upload it,
1672280	1673640	but when none of them click it,
1673720	1677080	YouTube will probably decide that it's not worth promoting much further.
1677080	1679720	By creating a committed audience on social media,
1679720	1682360	they could increase CTR of the video at the start,
1682360	1687160	and boost it to additional audiences who may be drawn in by their regular giveaway formula.
1687160	1689640	However, one thing that they really didn't take into account
1689640	1693640	was the fact that the proportion of committed fans was astronomically low.
1693640	1699160	For a 4 million subscriber channel to have 13k followers on Twitter is embarrassing,
1699160	1701800	especially given the volume that they posted on there.
1701800	1704440	I think they were always trying to add a depth and commitment
1704440	1706520	that they themselves couldn't bring to the table,
1706520	1710520	and when people recognised that, they moved on, and that couldn't have felt good.
1710520	1715000	I don't think it's easy for any creator to realise that their channel isn't what it used to be.
1715000	1719240	There are very few creators who can maintain the spotlight for an extended length of time,
1719240	1722280	and even some of the larger stars have fallen rather hard,
1722280	1725560	and when people do fall, there are many different ways to cope with it.
1725560	1728840	You could quit YouTube and try and find another career,
1728840	1731000	you could start a new channel or change brands,
1731000	1733880	or you could just accept that you'll never be quite where you were,
1733880	1736680	and just make content for the reduced audience.
1736680	1739240	Of course, the brothers took none of these options,
1739240	1741800	but maybe they didn't have the time to consider these options
1741800	1744120	because before they could come to terms with this,
1744120	1747560	they had something else, much more horrific to come to terms with.
1747560	1751480	In a video called We're Quiting YouTube Because We're Dying,
1751480	1753720	they open up about these struggles.
1753720	1757400	And it's just hit a point where we literally can't do it anymore.
1758360	1763640	And it's sad because this is what we love doing,
1763640	1765400	this is what we love doing so much,
1766120	1769080	and our bodies literally can't do it anymore.
1770200	1773560	I know a lot of you guys are probably wondering right now what we're talking about,
1775800	1779240	but pretty much we're both really sick,
1779880	1783800	and this could be the last video that we have.
1783800	1785880	Oh no, what exactly is happening?
1787560	1790520	I've been fighting this kidney disease now for literally four years,
1791320	1793320	and it's finally got the best in me.
1794040	1796120	I can't literally fight it anymore.
1796120	1799400	I'm holding 16 kilos of fluid in my body,
1799400	1803560	and when I say fluid, it's literally because my kidneys can't filter my fluid out anymore.
1804280	1808920	And you know how painful it is to be locked inside your own body?
1809560	1813400	With all this fluid that you can't physically move, you can't eat, you're not hungry.
1813960	1817560	No matter what you do, you can't eat, you're not hungry at all.
1818600	1820280	My body's literally at the end.
1820280	1824600	It appears that Jonathan's kidney disease has returned in a much more aggressive fashion,
1824600	1827640	and now he is suffering from excessive amounts of fluid buildup,
1827640	1830280	which is affecting every aspect of his life.
1830280	1834120	But it doesn't stop there, as apparently Thomas has also been suffering too.
1835080	1840440	And every single day I wake up, it's like just absolute vertigo.
1840440	1843960	And if you guys don't know what vertigo is, it's like dizziness.
1843960	1849240	You know when you're on a roller coaster, you get off and everything's spinning,
1849240	1850280	the world is spinning.
1850840	1856200	Imagine that happening to you every single day for the entire duration of the day,
1856840	1860920	and it's just like on, off, on, off, on, off,
1860920	1863880	and you just keep getting dizzy every single day for four years.
1864280	1867720	That's kind of what's happened, what that is, what's happened to me.
1869000	1872920	And then you get acne, and then your stomach's always hurting, you vomit,
1872920	1877240	and it's just like, you kind of can't live.
1878040	1880760	Of absolute vertigo.
1880760	1881320	All right.
1883240	1886600	You feel like you're in a box, and you can't escape.
1887240	1888600	Your mind goes insane.
1889240	1890120	You can't breathe.
1891080	1897000	You just get so tight and worn out, and it's just like,
1897960	1901240	you kind of wish you could just put yourself to sleep forever, sort of thing.
1902200	1903880	But obviously there's no way to do that.
1905000	1907800	This did not appear to be good, and given their medical conditions,
1907800	1912200	it was very understandable that they would not want to continue pursuing their YouTube careers.
1912200	1916680	It was obviously just highly unfortunate that this coincided with a decrease in views,
1916680	1918920	and they were, of course, legitimately dying.
1918920	1923640	However, like the true province they were, they had one more important announcement to make.
1923640	1927880	Guys, we want to say a serious thank you to every single person that's watched our videos.
1927880	1930360	Seriously, all you guys out there, we love you so much.
1930920	1934280	And we want you to know two things.
1934280	1936440	First thing is we want to give back to you guys.
1936440	1939640	Every single one of you, we're going to hold a huge giveaway right now.
1940200	1943080	We're going to give away two iPhone Xs, two of them.
1943080	1944440	We're literally going to give away two of them.
1944440	1946200	That's how much we love you guys.
1946200	1949400	And all you got to do is literally like this video,
1949400	1952520	turn on notifications on our channel, and subscribe.
1953080	1953720	And that's it.
1953720	1955480	And you're entered into the giveaway.
1955480	1958360	We're giving one last giveaway just because we seriously want to give back,
1958360	1961080	because we honestly love you all so much.
1961080	1961960	That's the first thing.
1961960	1964920	Second thing is we want you to know Jesus Christ loves you too.
1965480	1965960	Wow.
1965960	1967400	Give them a round of applause.
1969880	1971960	It was a moment of true selflessness.
1971960	1974200	These individuals, dying of their ailments,
1974200	1978520	found it in their hearts to once more give back to a community that has supported them.
1978520	1981480	It's a sort of generosity that just brings you to tears.
1981480	1982520	You love to see it.
1982520	1985800	However, if you were watching the video and became slightly suspicious,
1985800	1987240	then you know what?
1987240	1991320	You might have justified reason because they go into depth regarding their suffering,
1991320	1994760	and it just becomes a bit implausible.
1994760	1999000	Imagine for four years you're feeling sick, dizzy, vomiting,
1999640	2003640	and your stomach feels like it's practically a volcano.
2004200	2009480	And you go doctor after doctor, hospital after hospital,
2010120	2012520	and they all keep telling you there's nothing wrong with you.
2013480	2016680	Um, that's what's happened to me.
2018520	2021080	In fact, if they were suffering to the extent that they were,
2021080	2024120	how come they've had the strength to fly all the way to America?
2024120	2030280	How did any airline let them do that without them acquiring some special permission?
2030280	2035240	They then must have recorded and edited and subsequently uploaded this video,
2035240	2038440	not looking particularly different to any of their other videos.
2038440	2041480	In fact, if they'd been suffering so badly over the months prior,
2041480	2045320	what made them so capable to record multiple videos often?
2045320	2048200	We'd seen very little symptoms demonstrated on screen,
2048200	2051480	and although a person would obviously avoid showing those symptoms,
2051480	2054760	the frequency of their upload suggested they would have struggled
2054760	2057480	if this illness was as severe as they framed it.
2057480	2059080	But they had one more hope.
2060840	2062280	We've got this one doctor,
2064920	2066440	and we've done a lot of like,
2067800	2072040	we've been researching literally for hours on end
2072600	2075880	to try and figure out how we're gonna get better.
2077480	2082120	And we found this one man by the name of Dr. John Bergman,
2083080	2087960	and he's our last hope.
2088600	2091240	He's literally our last chance.
2092280	2095240	He's our last chance at being us again.
2096200	2098120	He's our last chance at living again.
2099160	2100680	Well, two more hopes.
2101720	2103240	With the power of you guys,
2103960	2105080	with the power of us,
2105800	2106920	and the power of Jesus,
2107560	2108680	Jesus Christ,
2108680	2109240	and God,
2110680	2112760	we'll be able to do this, I think.
2112760	2113480	So right now,
2114520	2116200	all you guys watching this video
2116840	2118760	will want to ask one thing from you guys,
2119320	2122520	is that you close your eyes and you make a prayer for us
2122520	2124440	through the name of Jesus Christ.
2124440	2126520	Because if you guys do that for us,
2126520	2127880	I know we'll get better,
2127880	2128920	and I know we'll heal.
2129480	2129960	Ah.
2143480	2144760	With the upload of the video,
2144760	2147800	there was an outpouring of support and sympathy
2147800	2149480	from all sorts of audiences,
2149480	2153400	although once again, the record on the video is quite unclear.
2153400	2154760	We do know that after upload,
2154760	2156920	they were receiving a lot of likes and comments
2156920	2158920	that seemed to be believing in their nature.
2158920	2161400	This screenshot shows that their like dislike ratio
2161400	2163960	was around 95% at that point.
2163960	2166680	It was a video that would generate that sort of support,
2166680	2167960	particularly from audiences
2167960	2171320	who may have become acquainted with them in previous videos.
2171320	2174680	If they're naive enough to be roped in by the giveaways and clickbait,
2174680	2178520	then someone talking to them about dying is probably just as believable,
2178520	2181880	particularly considering that many people would be hesitant to call them out,
2181880	2185080	telling someone who might be going through an excessive amount of suffering
2185080	2186120	that they're faking it,
2186120	2188440	or exaggerating it might be sketchy,
2188440	2191720	and you wouldn't want to agree with someone already suffering like that.
2191720	2194680	However, not everyone conforms to that formula,
2194680	2197080	in fact, there's always one person who doesn't,
2197800	2199000	the commentator.
2199000	2203720	In this instance, the bold individual who shed the most light onto this was Leon Lush,
2203720	2205960	although he was rather sensitive to the possibility
2205960	2208760	that these gentlemen may be suffering from some sort of illness,
2208760	2211000	he decided to take the side as skepticism,
2211000	2214040	especially given the very ham-fisted giveaway.
2214040	2216200	A giveaway in your We're Dying video,
2216200	2218920	where people have to like and subscribe and turn notifications on
2218920	2221480	to stay updated and see if they won the giveaway
2221480	2223240	in your We're Fucking Dying video?
2226360	2228360	I'll tell you what, it's a good thing I'm a detective,
2228360	2231160	because it's a red flag right here,
2231240	2233000	this is a fucking red mother,
2233000	2234200	this flag is redder,
2234200	2235880	I just cannot.
2235880	2240600	It was interesting because I had watched so many extreme games videos at that point,
2240600	2244760	that although the giveaway would be rightfully viewed as inappropriate by many people,
2244760	2246120	I was just numb to it,
2246120	2248600	and I knew that even if they were genuinely dying,
2248600	2251240	they'd probably still do this thing regardless.
2251240	2254760	However, for many viewers, particularly the more commentary oriented ones,
2254760	2258760	this was a tell-all sign these guys weren't being the most honest.
2258760	2262280	The more obvious point for me was that if these guys were planning to quit YouTube
2262280	2263320	because they were dying,
2263320	2265800	then they wouldn't care if people subscribed to their channel.
2265800	2270600	As noted earlier, subscriptions are not an accurate way to measure entry into these competitions,
2270600	2273160	as many people don't have their subscriptions public,
2273160	2277000	and the reason to increase subscriptions is therefore completely self-motivated,
2277000	2280040	but if they were dying, there would be no motivation to do that.
2280040	2283640	The confusion was furthered when the lads updated the timeline by making this video,
2283640	2286440	in which he performed a cover of a photograph by Ed Sheeran,
2286440	2288600	which I know will be copyright claimed if I play,
2288600	2291000	so nice bait lads, I'm not falling for it.
2291000	2293800	Nonetheless, the tone of this video is pretty dramatic.
2295080	2296680	Guys, the doctor just told us...
2300840	2302680	that Johnny's got four weeks to live.
2306840	2308360	He doesn't deserve this.
2308360	2313000	But I of course understand why you'd be so upset given the dire circumstances.
2313000	2314680	So yes, he's dying, but suddenly,
2314680	2317880	they're sat at a lovely Riviera promoting another giveaway,
2317880	2319960	and this time, the doctor's involved.
2319960	2323160	We also want you guys to know that the doctor that we're going to right now,
2323160	2324680	we found him from YouTube,
2324680	2328520	so we want you guys to check out his YouTube channel and subscribe to him.
2328520	2329960	If you subscribe to his channel,
2329960	2332520	you're gonna double your chances at winning this giveaway.
2332520	2334120	So who is this doctor?
2334120	2337000	The doctor's name is John Bergman, he is a chiropractor.
2337000	2339000	Now, I don't want to decry chiropractors,
2339000	2341640	because I do actually know a fair few people in my life
2341640	2343400	who have been significantly helped by them.
2343400	2346840	In fact, I think I might need to take a trip to one eventually myself.
2346840	2350280	However, I would stress that if you are dying of kidney failure,
2350280	2353240	a chiropractor probably will not cure you.
2353240	2355720	The fact also stands for severe vertigo,
2355720	2357880	and given the severity of their illnesses,
2357880	2362120	I'm just concerned they were completely unaccompanied in this journey to America.
2362120	2364760	I mean, it all seems a little far-fetched.
2364760	2366520	The point is not that they were not ill,
2366520	2368280	but that they were clearly not dying,
2368280	2369800	and that in both of their instances,
2369880	2371560	the video stating that, you know,
2371560	2375400	one of them may have four weeks left to live seemed ridiculous and manipulative.
2375400	2376360	Why would they do this?
2376360	2380440	Well, the first reason is one that I believe is fairly easy to state, views.
2380440	2381960	As noted at the start of the video,
2381960	2385000	we tend to follow people's battles with illness quite closely,
2385000	2388200	and we like to show our support and feel like we're making a difference.
2388200	2391160	Therefore, these things generate a lot of attention.
2391160	2393080	Secondly, well subscriber loyalty.
2393080	2396440	Once again, these creators are trying to create a connection with their audience
2396440	2398920	on the basis of experiences that they are going through,
2398920	2401880	rather than anything actually relating to their personality.
2401880	2405880	The thing is that any regular conduct that is morally justifiable to make videos about
2405880	2407720	probably has already made videos on them,
2407720	2409080	and probably better videos,
2409080	2413240	and therefore these creators need to push the boundaries in a way that most people wouldn't.
2413240	2416520	In fact, this development ties quite nicely into their previous content,
2416520	2419960	which was also based around doing what people were not prepared to do.
2419960	2422440	It's just the reasons that most people weren't prepared to do it
2422440	2424120	are quite different this time around.
2424120	2426360	The third reason is because, as mentioned earlier,
2426440	2430120	people are much more hesitant to call people who may be faking these things out,
2430120	2431240	in case they were wrong.
2431240	2434280	This meant that there was a higher chance of them getting away with this.
2434280	2437080	If people did call them out, well, how dare you?
2437080	2438920	You could drive them to suicide.
2438920	2441880	Now I know that a lot of you guys would be saying that you can't die from this,
2441880	2442520	but you can.
2442520	2444600	How many people have died from depression?
2444600	2448040	How many people have died from anxiety and stress?
2448040	2449880	It just pushes you to a point,
2449880	2452360	when everyone's telling you that you're not telling the truth,
2452360	2454440	it pushes you to a point in your mental state,
2454440	2457160	where you can just suicide, you can do anything.
2457160	2459720	And honestly, I'm not the kind of person that would suicide,
2459720	2461720	because I have Jesus Christ in my life,
2461720	2464440	I would never suicide, no matter what pain I'm ever going through,
2464440	2466280	suicide is never the option.
2466280	2469720	But I'm just saying that that is the point where it was getting to,
2469720	2473960	and my mental state was not stable at all from this sickness.
2473960	2477320	And the other point that they continued to push was Dr. Bergman.
2477320	2481080	All you got to do to enter this giveaway is subscribe to Dr. Bergman,
2481080	2484200	because we want you guys not only to enter a giveaway,
2484200	2485640	you could win an awesome iPhone,
2485640	2488200	but you will also learn the truth about health,
2488200	2490680	because he knows every single answer to the sickness,
2490680	2493480	he knows a cure to cancer, he knows a cure to liver disease,
2493480	2496520	he knows a cure to kidney disease, he knows a cure to everything.
2496520	2498520	You guys are acting like he's just a chiropractor,
2498520	2500920	but trust me, he is much more than a chiropractor,
2500920	2504920	he is a genius, he knows everything to do with healing the human body.
2504920	2507720	So we urge you right now, go subscribe to him,
2507720	2509720	go click his videos, because he knows the truth.
2510840	2512520	I'm not entirely sure why they did this,
2512600	2514680	maybe they had some agreement with the doctor,
2514680	2517720	but then pushing the narrative that actually Dr. John Bergman
2517720	2521000	could cure any illness may have appeared funny to us,
2521000	2523480	but it actually could have been quite sinister.
2523480	2524600	Let's talk about that more.
2531960	2536120	I don't know what the alternative timeline was for these creators,
2536120	2539640	prior to people like Leon Lurch throwing a spanner in the works,
2539640	2541400	but by the end of the response video,
2541400	2545240	I came to the conclusion that whatever was going on was some kind of scam.
2571400	2573560	In this video, we know you guys know the truth,
2573560	2575240	we know you guys believe in us,
2575240	2579480	we know you guys know what is actually going on with our bodies and with our lives,
2579480	2582200	and we're gonna keep filling you guys in as much as possible.
2582200	2586600	Honestly, Dr. Bergman is starting to show some crazy improvement on our bodies,
2586600	2589640	we're going to him three times a day, every single day,
2589640	2592520	working on ourselves, trying to get ourselves fixed and healed,
2592520	2594200	and a scam is a strong word,
2594200	2597000	but at the end of the day they were promoting this chiropractor
2597000	2600120	as the individual who could cure all these illnesses.
2600120	2602760	When that sort of statement is blatantly false,
2602760	2607160	and it's easy to point at them and laugh at their complete ignorance in these statements,
2607160	2611880	but those statements were made when they were under a lot of scrutiny and pressure.
2611880	2613560	If no one had really challenged them,
2613560	2617800	and they had exercised their significant influence over a fairly gullible fanbase,
2617800	2620680	they could have spread some legitimately harmful messages.
2620680	2624440	I don't doubt that there may be some legitimate illness that Jonathan may be encountering,
2624440	2627320	and the evidence that there are some symptoms is very clear,
2627320	2629880	but that does not suffice for the argument that you are making,
2629880	2631880	which is much more preachy and radical.
2631880	2633480	You are not just claiming that you are dying,
2633480	2635480	you are promoting general doubt of a system,
2635480	2636760	albeit not perfect,
2636760	2638760	that has done a lot of good for many people,
2638760	2642280	while promoting this single individual as some sort of miracle worker.
2642280	2646120	I also thought it was funny that they would have agreed to go on an interview with Keemstar,
2646120	2648920	but under the premise that they would know the questions before,
2648920	2650680	which obviously didn't come to a head
2650680	2653960	because they had no confidence in their narrative under further scrutiny,
2653960	2655000	especially live.
2655000	2658120	When people are suffering from an illness, they may become desperate,
2658120	2659560	they are definitely vulnerable,
2659560	2661800	particularly when looking for possible cures.
2661800	2665720	Now as said, during the first video I have become so numb to their giveaways
2665720	2670600	that they didn't even seem out of place in this much more sensitive content.
2670600	2673880	In the two year old video where they talk about Jonathan's kidney condition,
2673880	2675480	they do exactly the same thing.
2675480	2679000	Who else would be completely used to Extreme Games' type of content?
2679000	2683960	The core audience, the fanbase, the people who actually choose to click on every video,
2683960	2687880	what happens when they hear these two guys talking about how they're dying,
2687880	2691080	and how their last hope is this chiropract in California,
2691080	2693880	and I'm not saying that an overwhelming number of people
2693880	2697480	would be influenced by this sort of propaganda, which is what it is,
2697480	2701240	but we've all been in situations where we've been looking for some sort of miracle,
2701240	2705800	and whether knowingly or not they have asserted to provide an answer to that.
2705800	2708280	In the original video this message was more subtle,
2708280	2712760	but under pressure they cracked, that sounded like a pair of rather unhinged individuals.
2712760	2714920	It is a scam, that's what it is.
2714920	2719960	As noted, they also integrated the giveaway with a subscription to Dr John Bergman's channel,
2719960	2722840	which once again is extremely impractical for multiple reasons,
2722840	2726280	and something that a channel that size would not be able to organise,
2726280	2727960	especially if they were dying.
2727960	2732120	I know many people may be more focused on the aspect that they were trying to gain subs from
2732120	2735720	a video in which they talk about their impending death through giveaways,
2735720	2738920	but I'm more annoyed at the fact that they emotionally manipulated people
2738920	2741000	into thinking that they were about to die,
2741000	2745320	and then presented the solution as this miracle doctor who you should all subscribe to.
2745320	2747800	It's unhealthy and pretty dangerous.
2747800	2751960	I feel that if uninterrupted, they probably would have followed this treatment through,
2751960	2756120	claimed to have been cured, and then used that emotional victory to try and sell the practice
2756120	2758680	as further credibility for this chiropractor,
2758680	2763000	as well as winning over all these fans who were ardently rousing for them to come through.
2763000	2765400	I can't tell you if this plan would have worked,
2765400	2767160	to be honest I'm kinda skeptical,
2767160	2770200	but it was good that people did actually step in and say something,
2770200	2772440	and actually point out what was wrong.
2772440	2775080	Also, to add on to my two narratives here,
2775080	2777880	the other character that has made appearances in these videos
2777880	2780680	was our lord and saviour Jesus Christ.
2780680	2783000	Before we literally prove anything to anyone,
2783000	2784440	what we wanna say first of all is,
2784440	2788280	we forgive every single one of you guys that has created a hate video on us.
2788280	2789560	Every single comment,
2789560	2791240	every single thing that any of you have said,
2791240	2792120	we forgive you,
2792120	2793960	because that's what Jesus Christ would do.
2793960	2794760	He would forgive you,
2794760	2798440	he would forgive you no matter what you've done to him if you go to him for forgiveness,
2798440	2800520	and that's exactly what we're gonna do to you guys,
2800520	2802840	cause Jesus Christ lives inside of us,
2802840	2805720	and we forgive every single person that's created hate on us.
2805720	2809720	However, it wasn't until two months later when they made their post recovery video
2809720	2811240	that the truth becomes clear.
2811240	2814920	Now this is the one video that I do not actually have the original copy of,
2814920	2819640	so I'll just use the Leon Lush reaction video to both summarise exactly how I feel
2819640	2820600	about their rhetoric,
2820600	2823080	and suitably deliver the tone of the video.
2823080	2825640	The person that has been there all this time,
2825640	2827640	that we should have had our faith in,
2827640	2828440	not doctors,
2829000	2830280	not specialists,
2830280	2831640	not anyone of this world,
2831640	2834040	the person that we have put our faith into,
2834040	2836040	his name is Jesus Christ.
2836040	2838040	Now that is what we have done just recently,
2838040	2842040	we have literally put our sicknesses into Jesus Christ's hands,
2842040	2843800	and as you guys know if you've read the bible,
2843800	2845560	or if you know anything about Jesus,
2845560	2846680	he's a healer.
2846680	2849320	He can heal you cause he is the son of God.
2849320	2852440	He can do miracles and literally do whatever he wants.
2852440	2854920	So we have put our faith in him and I tell you right now,
2854920	2857560	yes I might still have a little bit of oedema left,
2857560	2860280	but I feel no pain.
2860280	2861800	It was in fact Jesus,
2861800	2862840	Jesus healed them,
2862840	2864760	Jesus was the person all along,
2864760	2867080	in fact they didn't need any doctors at all,
2867080	2867720	after all,
2867720	2871960	those are the same doctors who had told Thomas that there was in fact nothing wrong with him.
2871960	2874600	The only authority that you should trust is Jesus,
2874600	2878280	and Jesus has made the conscious decision to heal those suffering gentlemen.
2878280	2882520	Praise the Lord and his random healings of vertigo through California chiropractors.
2882520	2883320	Now as mentioned,
2883320	2885720	the lads have been promoting Christianity for a while,
2885800	2889720	but here is one of the times where it seems to have been used for a less than benign purpose.
2889720	2890920	Sometimes when people are down,
2890920	2893640	bringing religion into their lives can legitimately help them,
2893640	2898360	and I might even go as far to say the emotional uplift that religion can provide for some people
2898360	2901160	might aid people's fight against certain illnesses.
2901160	2901640	However,
2901640	2904520	to me it seems like it's been used as a scapegoat here,
2904520	2907400	as a way to explain how they have managed to heal themselves,
2907400	2910600	and definitely to try and create a connection with the Christian crowd
2910600	2912840	who will brand this as some miracle healing,
2912840	2915560	and as proof that God does in fact exist.
2915560	2918680	They have created this perfect arc where they were all going to die,
2918680	2920200	they needed all this support,
2920200	2923160	and when they had it they made a miraculous recovery,
2923160	2926360	thanks to Dr. John Bergman and Jesus Christ.
2926360	2927160	Amen.
2927160	2930440	In the video they also state that their DMs are open on Instagram,
2930440	2932440	and they are there to spread the message of God,
2932440	2934840	and if you are interested you should reach out to them.
2934840	2939560	This was basically a way of reaching out to the right audience who may be brought into this story,
2939560	2940360	and believe me,
2940360	2941720	although few and far between,
2941720	2943480	they're definitely out there.
2943480	2944600	Johnny and Tommy,
2944600	2945960	you guys are amazing people,
2945960	2948680	and for those of you who think they're pretending to be sick,
2948680	2949320	screw you,
2949320	2951720	cause these guys are strong believers in Christ,
2951720	2953720	and they help me get through a lot,
2953720	2955960	I know I can go to them whenever I need them,
2955960	2956760	thank you.
2956760	2957320	Now,
2957320	2957800	once again,
2957800	2959240	if they're helping people,
2959240	2959800	you know,
2959800	2961160	I can't take that away from them,
2961160	2962120	but overall,
2962120	2964360	as a greater cultural effect,
2964360	2967320	I class these escapades as hope baiting,
2967320	2969880	it's basically telling people that there are all these solutions
2969880	2973560	that can be found in places that they need to just put their faith in,
2973640	2975640	this problem solving entity,
2975640	2979960	I feel that they are basically trying to couple themselves to that notion of hope
2979960	2983000	with the intention of winning back an audience from the brink,
2983000	2984280	which as Leon notes,
2984280	2985480	wasn't the most hopeful.
2986040	2988200	But it does seem awfully convenient,
2988200	2988920	you know what I mean?
2988920	2990360	Eight weeks ago we were dying,
2990360	2990920	definitely,
2990920	2992040	we're not lying about that,
2992040	2992920	we were gonna die,
2992920	2993480	vertigo,
2993480	2994600	leaky gut,
2994600	2994920	dead.
2996280	2997560	JC hooked it up bro,
2997560	3000040	JC came through in the clutch,
3000040	3000840	not dead anymore,
3000840	3001160	in fact,
3001160	3002360	we're feeling great,
3002360	3004040	be sure to like and subscribe.
3004040	3005640	But was it all that simple?
3005640	3009080	Was it just two guys using a load of shit to try and keep their channel afloat,
3009080	3011880	or were they a bit more invested in it than I thought?
3011880	3014840	Let's take a look back and try to come to a conclusion.
3032360	3042120	I mean the one point in their favour is that they started preaching about their closeness to Jesus
3042120	3043800	during their channel hire point,
3043800	3049080	and therefore it seems unlikely that they just had conjured up this belief of Jesus for the sake of views.
3049080	3051640	Maybe they did view their success as a miracle,
3051640	3052200	I mean,
3052200	3053560	I can understand why.
3053560	3055400	I wouldn't put it down to Jesus though,
3055400	3057800	I'd put it down to some rather crafty clickbait,
3057800	3060280	which I'm not sure Jesus would approve of to be honest,
3060280	3062760	though I haven't spoken to him so I can't confirm.
3063480	3064680	Looking back at their history,
3064680	3066920	they've really done anything to succeed,
3066920	3070680	whether that was completely transforming their channel branding to a Pokemon channel,
3070680	3073400	and then basically acting like that phase never happened,
3073400	3076520	the only thing that remained remotely consistent was their giveaways,
3076520	3077240	and in effect,
3077240	3078520	I can understand why.
3078520	3079960	And this is the strange thing,
3079960	3082200	although they changed their content in and out,
3082200	3085480	they clearly never really identified the content with the success,
3085480	3087000	they identified the giveaways,
3087000	3090200	because the giveaways were what provided them these subscriptions,
3090200	3092040	the content was just filler to them,
3092040	3094840	and the reason that I think they look at it from that perspective
3094840	3097000	is because of how they use the Christian faith.
3098520	3100040	When someone's channel begins to fail,
3100040	3102040	they grip onto a formula more tightly,
3102040	3104840	they try and use the same tricks to a greater extent,
3104840	3106440	and you can see this with the land,
3106440	3108840	both in their view of religion and giveaways,
3108840	3112360	these are the only two things that seem to increase in their intensity
3112360	3114040	when their channels begin to fail,
3114040	3116680	they put their success in giveaways and Jesus,
3116680	3118280	so when it begins to fall flat,
3118280	3120440	they create a greater investment in it.
3120440	3123320	Honestly, if they thought they could get away with crediting giveaways
3123320	3124360	for saving their lives,
3124360	3125720	then they probably would.
3125720	3127880	That's exactly why their channel died,
3127880	3129320	even if they haven't.
3129320	3130680	If you want to keep people watching,
3130680	3132600	you need to have faith in your content,
3132600	3135800	not concepts that are mostly separate to what you're creating.
3135800	3137880	Careers are seldom built on gimmicks,
3137880	3140200	they're built on fleshed out characters who we appreciate
3140200	3141640	not because of what happens to them,
3141640	3144600	but because of how they react to their environments and evolve.
3144600	3147960	Someone fighting a life threatening illness can be extremely riveting,
3147960	3151480	but only because of how they respond to the battle that they are fighting.
3151480	3152680	It's about character,
3152680	3155560	and I guarantee that even if they had sold it to people,
3155560	3157160	they wouldn't have revived their channel
3157160	3159000	because they didn't show the character of someone
3159000	3161080	who was genuinely going through those struggles.
3161080	3162120	They may have found Jesus,
3162120	3163960	but they haven't found the moral compass
3163960	3167480	that many religious individuals would argue should come with him.
3167480	3170120	It's the worst brand of religious exploitation.
3170120	3172040	Jesus is the ultimate authority,
3172040	3174520	and he helped us heal because he did.
3174520	3175480	It's bizarre.
3175480	3176280	It's a con.
3176280	3178200	They're trying to connect people like that,
3178200	3180360	and I just do not stand.
3180360	3181560	And I'm no fan of religion,
3181560	3183080	but I accept that, on principle,
3183080	3184760	it has a moral compass,
3184760	3189160	and I don't believe there's any way for these guys to remain inside the Christian moral compass,
3189160	3190840	given the way that they have behaved,
3190840	3193320	which leads me to believe that they're moral licenses,
3193320	3195800	people who basically identify with these causes
3195800	3199560	to make themselves feel better about not necessarily practicing what they preach.
3199560	3202120	Maybe they're trying to justify it to themselves as well,
3202120	3204600	but really, looking at it from a removed perspective,
3204600	3206440	it could have been much worse than it was.
3206440	3207880	People called it out early,
3207880	3211800	and therefore the dissemination of a potentially harmful doctrine was suppressed,
3211800	3214760	but they still have a responsibility for the intent,
3214760	3217720	which they retained, as shown by their response video.
3217720	3218680	Trust us, guys.
3218680	3220360	They have removed these videos since,
3220360	3222680	as said, they seem to enjoy removing content,
3222680	3224600	but they haven't formally commented on it.
3224600	3226680	If they do regret it, well, okay,
3226680	3228600	it's not that I'm not willing to hear them out.
3228600	3231400	In the instance that they were just really invested in this treatment,
3231400	3232840	which I feel is unlikely,
3232840	3234200	maybe they're not bad people,
3234200	3238040	but what they did was excessively reckless and irrational considering their fanbase,
3238040	3240280	and how impressible many of them seemed at the time.
3240280	3244600	You don't deserve to have that responsibility given the possible repercussions.
3244600	3247080	That fanbase was built from the start on giveaways,
3247080	3250520	whether they were giving away a Clash of Clans account or an iPhone.
3250520	3253720	You need to have some beggar's belief to sign up to a channel for that,
3253720	3254680	and given that to me,
3254680	3257800	they seem to be convinced that the giveaways are a catch to the channel,
3257800	3260520	they had to know the audience that they were trying to rope in
3260520	3262520	with a much more consequential narrative.
3262520	3267560	Now, normally this would be the part where I talk about how their channel has died,
3267560	3269000	due to these escapades,
3269000	3271480	but also due to the fact that they could not evolve,
3271480	3273640	which seemed to be a constant block for them.
3273640	3276920	However, ironically, and maybe even depressingly,
3276920	3279240	they've revived their channel very recently,
3279240	3280760	and that is the problem with YouTube,
3280760	3282840	there would be people who just don't know,
3282840	3285400	especially when you make flavourless content.
3285400	3287720	That was the problem with someone like Austin Jones,
3287720	3291240	even though, of course, that was much, much more serious.
3291240	3294520	Very briefly, after YouTube introduced abbreviated subscriber counts,
3294520	3297080	you can see the ugly, rounded up number jump up
3297080	3300520	in a way that it hasn't for maybe over a year at least.
3300520	3303560	Basically, what they're doing now is a rip-off of more content,
3303560	3306280	I mean, they even put Morgz in the tags of their videos,
3306280	3309640	and given that Morgz is a rip-off of, like, five other YouTubers,
3309640	3312200	it's hard to really argue that they've learned anything,
3312200	3313880	they're just following the paper trail.
3313880	3314760	What's in this?
3314760	3317000	I'm genuinely shocked, I don't know what's in either of these.
3317000	3320040	It's like it's Christmas before Christmas, Johnny, what is next?
3320040	3321000	It's your turn!
3321000	3322440	Alright, here we go then!
3322440	3323400	No!
3323400	3324280	It's a twin!
3324280	3325320	That's not Christmas, is it?
3325320	3326040	No!
3326040	3327480	Not the most charismatic,
3327480	3330680	although if they're not selling miracle cures to gullible audiences,
3330680	3332040	I guess it's an improvement.
3332040	3335240	Asking them to make decent content would probably be a step too far.
3335240	3338840	I still feel that their behaviour will be fresh in some people's memories,
3338840	3341640	given how forgettable they are for basically anything else,
3341640	3345400	and they will never immortalise themselves in a way that other individuals can,
3345400	3347320	because they coast on clickbait alone,
3347320	3350280	and the fact that one video can get over a million views back to back
3350280	3354520	with another video that barely cracks 50,000 is at least somewhat reassuring.
3354520	3358280	However, their lack of personality is probably why they've had a spike in success again,
3358280	3359880	because they are so damn forgettable,
3359880	3362200	people probably forgot this whole charade,
3362200	3364120	especially when they erased the history.
3364120	3368040	Nonetheless, for the first time ever, they seem to have let go of old habits,
3368040	3369080	there are no giveaways,
3369080	3371720	and they may have finally clocked that successful content
3371720	3374280	is not dependent on the number of giveaways you do.
3374280	3375960	Maybe they just had to let go,
3375960	3378360	which is something that they never could do before.
3378360	3381080	If you wanna win an iPhone 11, we might be giving one away.
3381080	3383080	Oh, never mind.
3383080	3385640	Wait, we might be giving one away?
3385640	3387080	Yes, an iPhone 11.
3387080	3389080	They've really outdone themselves this time.
3389080	3391800	I think on that bombshell, it's best to conclude.
3393080	3397400	Extreme Games' breakdown was strange in a way that it was a sign of a dying channel
3397400	3400680	trying to use old techniques to an insane extent,
3400680	3404440	but also the attempt of a channel to understand what that means
3404440	3406280	in the most tasteless way possible.
3406280	3408840	They're constantly trying to retain the aspects of a channel
3408840	3410680	with a greater connection with their fans,
3410680	3413080	but their genre will never permit that.
3413080	3416440	They will never be those sorts of creators, even if they die.
3416440	3419880	They have to understand the humanity behind individuals
3419880	3421800	and why we care about their lives.
3421800	3423640	If you build your career on clickbait,
3423640	3425960	we will never know enough about who you truly are
3425960	3428680	to understand how you interpret your own struggles,
3428680	3432120	and that's something Extreme Games could never really comprehend,
3432120	3434360	how to market their own humanity.
3434360	3436280	And it seems they've come to terms with it,
3436280	3438360	and are now as successful as ever.
3438360	3441000	It's just a shame that the journey to that destination
3441000	3443400	has been pretty manipulative and destructive.
3443400	3445000	I pray to God it was worth it.
3448200	3451080	So yes, that was the video, I hope you enjoyed.
3451080	3454760	It was an interesting one to script, certainly a bit longer than I anticipated,
3454760	3456520	but that's what happens sometimes.
3456520	3458600	I really want to give a big shout out to the editors,
3458600	3460920	they've done a fantastic job, I am sure,
3460920	3463720	and I would not have it any other way.
3464840	3467320	I would also like to give a big thanks to my Patreons,
3467320	3469640	$10 Patreons on the screen right now,
3469640	3472360	give a special thanks to my $50 Patreons,
3472360	3474360	Somehuller Blue, The Specter Angel,
3474360	3478120	Bowright, Nico Deschamps, Sarah Elizabeth and Caroline,
3478120	3481560	and a very special thanks to my $100 Patreons,
3481560	3484200	Brandon, Adam Michael, and Christopher Karas.
3485320	3487480	My Twitter is at The Right Opinion,
3487480	3489320	my Facebook The Right Opinion Official,
3489320	3492360	and my Discord, they're all linked in the pinned comment,
3492360	3496040	and if you have any other questions then feel free to hit me up there.
3496040	3497640	I hope you're having a wonderful day,
3497640	3499080	my go is going fairly average,
3499080	3502360	but hopefully something interesting can happen in my life soon enough,
3502360	3504200	I know I've been waiting long enough.
3504200	3506200	Anyhow, I don't really have much to add,
3506200	3508440	so I'll leave it here, I'm The Right Opinion,
3508440	3510840	and I will see you in the next one.
