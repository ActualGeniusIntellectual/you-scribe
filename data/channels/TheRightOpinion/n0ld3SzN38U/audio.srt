00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,680
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,440
and there are many ways that celebrities may immortalise themselves in popular culture,

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,680
maybe they pioneered a defining industry, maybe they released a series of critically acclaimed albums,

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,560
or maybe they died young. I know that was a bit of an abrupt segue, but there is a morbid fascination we have

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,360
with celebrities who didn't necessarily bow out in the most graceful fashion,

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,640
when someone with such great potential and apparent success is victim to the tragedy of a premature demise,

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,560
particularly those of artificial sorts, we're left thinking about what might have been for that individual,

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,760
and we're also encouraged to reflect on the industry that may have manufactured such an outcome.

9
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,480
Now make no mistake, some of these individuals were incredibly prolific regardless of their depth,

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,880
and you don't want to overstate their depth as if to take away from their artistic contribution,

11
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,880
but when someone passes away, that contribution is often frozen in that moment,

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,440
and we are drawn to the attention of what that death has taken away from us as individuals.

13
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,080
A really great example of that was Stefan Karl Steffensen, the guy who played Robbie Rotten,

14
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,320
and provided me and many others with the numerous memes that yielded from We Are Number One.

15
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:16,200
His diagnosis, recovery, relapse, and eventual death was an emotional rollercoaster that many people were on all the way,

16
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,200
but his death reflected something else. Because we were there throughout the situation,

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,080
we had time to provide our support to someone we loved. Popular individuals dying prematurely

18
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:31,080
is not the most common event, and often what is even rarer is being able to foresee the possibility of that death,

19
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:37,400
as many people don't go public about it, and therefore the journey to that destination is often a fight we want to be there for.

20
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,280
There's an emotional battle that gives us purpose, to know that we might make a difference in that battle.

21
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,640
Therefore, it was natural that when people found out that today's subjects were dying, they wanted to show their support.

22
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,360
Who are those subjects? Well, they are a pair of YouTubers by the name of Xtreme Games,

23
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:59,240
the Australian brothers of Thomas and Jonathan, who do what you want to see, have fun, play games, and chill.

24
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,120
They describe their content as family friendly, and kid friendly, and in their five years on YouTube,

25
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:10,440
they've built up a fairly sturdy subscriber count of 4.24 million, and over 314 million views.

26
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,200
Pretty impressive. Where did those views come from? Well, who remembers Pro Gamer Jay? No one?

27
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,240
Well, let me refresh your memory. A couple years back, he was the punching bag for many commentators

28
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:27,320
who found his content a bit, well, laughable. He was notorious for rather misleading, albeit amusing, clickbait.

29
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,920
His most well known was a video that was titled, If You See Red Then You Are Colorblind, or Words To That Effect,

30
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,080
as he has changed it since then, the cheeky bugger. However, although many people picked on him,

31
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,120
maybe due to his delivery, he was part of a greater trend that was represented by multiple creators,

32
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,080
even to this day, that rated the power of leading your audience to believe that they were doing something

33
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,360
with higher stakes than what actually happened in the video.

34
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,360
Now, with that said, a lot of these channels specialised in various areas of clickbait.

35
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,840
There was obviously a significant amount of overlap, but they all occupied various corners.

36
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,560
Honestly, these videos should have died out much faster than they did, but some have, in fact, persisted.

37
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,120
The ones who have either grew into the creative maestros, such as Mr. Beast, who actually followed through

38
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:14,040
on their clickbaits, or a level of uninspired irony that I and other audiences appear still to be attempting

39
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,840
to understand, such as Mork's.

40
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:24,760
Guys, I'm so close, but I'm just not sure what the item is. What could come after B-O-O?

41
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:32,360
Wait a minute! Book! I guessed the letter K! Guys, what could that final letter be?

42
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,760
A math book! A mal book! A mad book! A mad book!

43
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,560
However, many of these creators also lost a lot of traction, with the introduction of corporate channels

44
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,120
like Brightside, who can just pump out these dire informational videos on a regular basis.

45
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,680
Many individual creators realised that they couldn't compete, and only channels who were doing things

46
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,640
that weren't just based on clickbait managed to survive.

47
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,760
Extreme Games were one of the channels that appeared to have gained most of their prominence off this trend initially.

48
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,800
Although they clearly had some presence prior to two years ago, this is the only content that really is still

49
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,880
accessible on their channel. In fact, one of the things that I found while researching their videos

50
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,000
is that they removed them at an unbelievably high rate.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
However, like many channels around this time, Extreme Games were the victim to the demise of that brand of content.

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,200
Extreme Games at their peak seemed to specialise in Nerf gun mods, DIY fidget spinners, and DIY Nerf guns.

53
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,720
Basically mixing and matching various trends at that point.

54
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,880
Now, there's been worse clickbait to be honest, but it became very clear that people were not going to be won over

55
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,920
by the concept of lava fidget spinners forever, and eventually their views began to fall.

56
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,360
Like many channels that coasted on the clickbait rather than the content,

57
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,240
people did not stick around when those topics lost their charm.

58
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,600
It didn't help that they were not the most charismatic of individuals.

59
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,720
That is literally an apple fidget spinner.

60
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,920
Oh man! We just made a fidget spinner out of an apple!

61
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,640
And the cool thing is, if you're hungry, you can just take a bite from it.

62
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,600
Who would have honestly thought that, ever? That is so cool.

63
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,520
Basically, they just couldn't maintain the brilliant momentum that they once had.

64
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,640
However, on the horizon, something much more sinister was brewing.

65
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,800
A tragedy about to befall both characters involved in this compelling tale.

66
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,600
They were going to face down a challenge much worse than a dead channel, death itself.

67
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,040
This is the end.

68
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,440
They were in the fight for their life, and their fanbase was right behind them.

69
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,960
They needed that support more desperately than anything they needed before.

70
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,360
The tale was of two brothers who were facing down their own life-threatening illnesses.

71
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,680
Jonathan suffering from a kidney problem, and Thomas suffering from severe vertigo.

72
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,800
However, very soon, a few voices of skepticism arose,

73
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,680
that stated that not everything was as it seems.

74
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,320
Now, as far as making shitty clickbaity content goes, I could care less.

75
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,680
I mean, there's millions of people that do this on the internet, and I say get that money.

76
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,640
More power to you.

77
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,600
But the second you start pretending you're dying in order to get clicks and views

78
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,800
after your channel's kind of suffering and not performing as well as it used to,

79
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,080
well, that's when I start to just raise a little eyebrow at it.

80
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,080
Join me today as I look into the story of Extreme Games,

81
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,080
and what led them to one of the most bizarre creator meltdowns in the last year,

82
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,960
and see if we can diagnose the real problem.

83
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,000
Are you ready?

84
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,560
Good.

85
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,600
I know I am.

86
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,120
Let us commence.

87
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,760
4.2 Million Subscribers

88
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:40,120
A channel that has 4.2 million subscribers, they couldn't have obtained that overnight.

89
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,080
Well, they didn't.

90
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,520
In spite of the fact that most of their content wasn't online anymore,

91
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,920
I have been able to create a somewhat accurate timeline of the progress of their channel,

92
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,080
and what it says about them as creators.

93
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,160
It's quite incredible, actually, the lack of public record of their content,

94
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,880
despite the monumental statistics.

95
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,000
The actual documented content is rather scarce.

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,600
One of the things that I found was that no one seemed to screenshot their content,

97
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,480
and that made it very hard to find archived versions.

98
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,480
In fact, this video would not exist if it hadn't been for Leon Lush's archivings

99
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,360
of their videos about their illnesses, so I wanted to extend my sincerest gratitude to him.

100
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,160
However, fortunately, because I am a tenacious bastard,

101
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,920
the one thing that Extreme Games did not do was clear their Twitter history,

102
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,480
and this is where it becomes quite spicy.

103
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,440
Now, what do we know?

104
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,480
We know that Extreme Games were formed in around 2014, mid 2014.

105
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,040
Now, we don't know exactly what they were doing back then,

106
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,920
however, unfortunately, their Twitter is pretty much untouched,

107
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,320
so we know the sort of content that they were tweeting.

108
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,880
Now, I want to have a quick trivia game, because you all know how much I love quizzes.

109
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,400
Today's million pound question is,

110
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,800
what sort of channel did Extreme Games brand themselves as in 2015?

111
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,000
Your options are a Clash of Clans gaming channel, or a free giveaway channel.

112
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,720
If you answered A or B, you'd only be half right, because it was both.

113
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,680
In fact, they'd really love to tell you that they were doing free giveaways

114
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,680
for Clash of Clans accounts.

115
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,040
I really do feel bad for anyone who was tagged in their insipid tweets,

116
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,360
telling them to make sure they like and subscribe,

117
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,800
so they're in with a chance to win an epic Clash of Clans account.

118
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,560
However, maybe they did have a legitimate passion for this Clash of Clans content,

119
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,800
because in rare footage of them with Banks plays,

120
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,240
they informed the audience that they were actually top ten at one point.

121
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,080
And so these guys right here are pretty much badasses at Clash Royale,

122
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,000
are they what y'all are number ten in the world at some point?

123
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,920
Yes, yes, we were at some point, but we're still pretty high up there at the moment.

124
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,680
Now, honestly, she seems more convinced than they do about this fun fact,

125
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,200
but I don't know, it looks like they did reach the top 50 at a stage,

126
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,520
so hey, it's not impossible.

127
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,440
After all, why wouldn't I trust these Extreme Gamers?

128
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,480
Looking at their other tweets,

129
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,840
they also said hello to some people with a couple of replies,

130
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,080
very productive conversation.

131
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,720
Honestly, I can't imagine what living this life would be like just tweeting at people,

132
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:05,480
but hey, they were young, probably around 16 and 17, 18,

133
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,280
and they were at that stage where they could learn and grow.

134
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,280
So how did they evolve in the coming years?

135
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,480
Well, it seems after hitting a few subscriber milestones, they spanned out.

136
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,200
They did some different games with giveaways, they did some prank calls with giveaways.

137
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,440
Honestly, they seemed to enjoy their giveaways.

138
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,440
Even when they were making different content,

139
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,080
they were still integrated with the giveaways.

140
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,840
They also had what must have been the shortest Shoutout Sunday series,

141
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:36,600
running from the 23rd of February 2016 to the 23rd of February 2016.

142
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,000
I hope that someone got their shoutout.

143
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Ultimately, their mentality represented a time where people were just so obsessed

144
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,280
with subscriber counts, and the short-term gain that could be obtained

145
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,280
by having a nice number next to your name,

146
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,760
that was more valued than actually constructing a channel

147
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,360
for which people would stick around for.

148
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,520
Most of these giveaways were presented with the commitment

149
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,920
that you needed to like and subscribe to the channel.

150
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,360
Now, beyond the fact that a person could not see who has liked their videos

151
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,240
unless they went on their channel and looked at their playlists,

152
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,040
and they would have to have a public playlist of liked videos,

153
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,360
it's also the same pretty much with subscriptions.

154
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,520
They would have to have their subscriptions public.

155
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,280
They could, in all fairness, look at who subscribed to them in their subscriber list.

156
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,080
However, that's only people who make their subscriptions public.

157
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,760
At this stage, a fair majority of giveaways were absolute codswallop,

158
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,880
and although I cannot comment on the legitimacy of the specific ones,

159
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,320
I highly doubt they were real.

160
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,360
Given that I highly doubt they were making much money when they started,

161
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,120
the volume of these giveaways was such that unless they were already oil barons,

162
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,880
I highly doubt they have the budget.

163
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,480
With that said, at the start there were a fair few people who did claim to win,

164
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,000
and they did seem to announce winners as well, even in later videos,

165
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,680
although once again my point about their flawed methodology still persists,

166
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,640
and just because there were some winners or some announced winners

167
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,520
doesn't mean that every single giveaway was legitimate.

168
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,680
There may be people who have claimed to give away things to winners,

169
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,200
but that would not be the case.

170
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,680
They also did some streaming on camcorder this time,

171
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,600
but that site's defunct, so that's another one lost to the vaults unfortunately.

172
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,840
Now with that said, given the topic, and given their competence with the topic,

173
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,080
they did acquire a sturdy fanbase, however it clearly wasn't good enough for them.

174
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,200
The pool audience for Clash of Clans is pretty restricted.

175
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,360
There are some popular channels, but you're not gonna have a plethora of them,

176
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,600
and with gamers as extreme as Tom and John,

177
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,160
they knew they could easily adapt with the changing environment, so they did.

178
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,000
But what was the big thing at the time around 2016?

179
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,040
Well it was Pokemon Go, so what did they do?

180
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,200
They rebranded to Extreme Games Pokemon Go,

181
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,960
that was literally the name of their channel,

182
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,000
and quickly began to churn out content catered to that audience,

183
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,440
of which back in 2016, there was a lot of desire for.

184
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,800
There was hesitant success when they started this content in July,

185
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,120
but by August, they were attaining subscribers at a rate not seen before.

186
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,200
What I assume made their content particularly successful alongside the topic choice,

187
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,880
was the giveaways.

188
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,800
And it's gonna be amazing.

189
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,080
Before we get into this video guys,

190
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,280
we wanna quickly run you through our huge giveaways that we're doing guys.

191
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,840
The first step to enter our Pokemon Go level 30 account giveaways is guys,

192
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,600
you gotta like this video.

193
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,760
We're trying to hit 10,000 likes on this video,

194
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,320
so every single person watching this video,

195
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,400
go down below and smash that like button,

196
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,440
it is one of the biggest steps to enter into this giveaway.

197
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,840
Giveaways back then were basically pasted at the start of videos by these creators.

198
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,160
What this would do is catch audiences who may not otherwise watch the whole video,

199
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,840
and persuade them to subscribe,

200
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,920
so that in the future when you upload it,

201
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,120
there would be a higher probability of them viewing your content.

202
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,640
At first, I didn't think this observation was particularly consequential,

203
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,000
however, I do want you to keep this in mind for their future content.

204
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,760
Combined with already high viewership,

205
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,400
this turned over a high subscriber rate for the lads,

206
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,880
and by the end of 2016, they hit 200,000 subscribers.

207
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,400
At first, it seemed bizarre to me that people would inundate their audience

208
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,840
with that level of giveaways,

209
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,040
they're obviously not real,

210
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,040
and all you're doing is creating a load of dormant subscribers who will desert you.

211
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,480
But then it hit me,

212
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,680
and it hit me hard.

213
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,480
Extreme Games ran a very interesting project on the surface,

214
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,880
because they weren't just empty shells of people,

215
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,240
they clearly have souls, and activities that they enjoy.

216
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,200
However, they were also rather unexceptional in their personality,

217
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,280
if someone was asked what made their content,

218
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,520
they would probably hesitate to provide an answer.

219
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,120
Because at first, the giveaways seemed to just be a vacuous inclusion

220
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,560
to increase subscriber count,

221
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,360
which they are,

222
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,840
let me emphasise that, of course, cannot be ignored.

223
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,200
However, after some brooding,

224
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,000
I came to the conclusion that it was actually the giveaways

225
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,560
that also gave them such a staying power.

226
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,120
Creators like Derv were only known for their giveaways,

227
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,880
because otherwise, their content provided nothing really of additional value.

228
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,280
With Extreme Games, their videos were mediocre, even tolerable at points.

229
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,880
This ultimately meant that if people had an additional reason to watch their content,

230
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,480
they normally would if it covered something that might have appealed to their interest.

231
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,760
At the same time, they could enter whatever definitely legitimate giveaway

232
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,040
the YouTuber was hosting,

233
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,280
and provide them with the view that they desired.

234
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,880
On top of this, the fact that Extreme Games

235
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,240
always said they would announce the winner in future videos

236
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,120
gave people a greater desire to watch those future videos

237
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,120
to see if they could find out if they had won.

238
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,440
So when they were making these Pokemon videos that were,

239
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,320
from my perspective, equatable to FIFA opening packs,

240
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,800
people would just find mild amusement from the content,

241
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,480
and then continue with their day.

242
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,080
This also allowed the brothers to change genre of content fairly easily,

243
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,520
because although clearly existent,

244
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,240
there wasn't an intense topic loyalty to what they covered.

245
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,520
This meant that although they had created over 200,000 subscribers

246
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,200
from Pokemon related content,

247
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,440
a number that many Pokemon creators would never consider changing their content for,

248
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,400
in the extreme world, it was rather elementary.

249
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,680
They continued their Pokemon content well into 2017,

250
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,520
however at around February time, they started to seemingly mix it up a little.

251
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,040
One of the first videos that appears to have been a real benchmark for this change

252
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:59,400
was another private video called $1 Cake vs $870 Cake.

253
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,760
At this point, they appeared to begin integrating some new types of videos,

254
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,400
ones that didn't focus around just Pokemon.

255
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:10,040
That's beginning the segue to eventually completely phase out Pokemon content altogether.

256
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,440
The other video that I really want to note is one called How I Almost Died.

257
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,480
Let's have a quick watch.

258
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,200
I take these every single day.

259
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,640
Now if you want to know why, make sure you watch this video all the way through,

260
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,080
and I will tell you why all these tablets need to be taken daily.

261
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,640
Before we get into this video guys, I want to quickly tell you guys,

262
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:32,040
we are holding some humongous giveaways, iTunes cards, Google Play cards,

263
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,080
and much more.

264
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,680
Oh, another giveaway.

265
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,520
So basically, in this video, they describe Jonathan's dice with death,

266
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,720
and how it affected them, over suitably emotional music.

267
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,720
So the kidney disease specialists actually checked my urine,

268
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,320
and checked that there was actually a lot of protein in my urine,

269
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,600
and actually a lot of blood in my urine, which are two bad things.

270
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,200
You don't want to have either of those in your urine, obviously.

271
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,800
But yeah, to those two bad things.

272
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,920
So they gave me three options.

273
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,440
They said option number one is you can get on Predicinal,

274
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,240
which is a tablet that like, really, I'll tell you guys a bit later,

275
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,520
really is bad for you.

276
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,680
Then there is another option where we could do nothing.

277
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,840
That's one of the options.

278
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,840
And then the third option was get a kidney biopsy to see exactly what I have.

279
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,000
It appears that Jonathan had a kidney condition that caused various symptoms,

280
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,680
and led him to be hospitalized.

281
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,040
I can't necessarily completely comment on the validity of the story.

282
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,760
What I can comment on is that it gave them two things.

283
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,280
A lot of views, and a lot of very sympathetic comments from individuals

284
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,960
who identified with that struggle.

285
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:38,440
A struggle that doesn't come easily, and a struggle often harder to open up about.

286
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,080
Although the piano was a rather heavy-handed measure,

287
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,600
many were prepared to look past it and see the humanity in the message,

288
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,280
and to witness that struggle.

289
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,760
Now as said, I'm not one to doubt this story.

290
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,240
The medicine that he's taking all checks out,

291
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,960
and he seems to have reasonable knowledge of the condition,

292
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,560
though it does enter suspicious territory at certain points.

293
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,200
He's not going to tell you the actual story.

294
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,480
I'll tell you the actual story.

295
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,480
That's not the crazy part, because normally people would be like,

296
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,040
okay, you can't see it, so you can't feel it, right?

297
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,440
They put in a drug, they numb your back.

298
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,680
This is the crazy part.

299
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,120
Johnny here didn't get any numbing anything.

300
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,040
So pretty much, he felt getting stabbed in the back multiple times.

301
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,440
He didn't get any of the numbing drugs to get to numb his back.

302
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,480
He wasn't asleep.

303
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,520
He wasn't anything.

304
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,960
He was just under there.

305
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,560
And the doctor, when he came out, he said,

306
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,120
this kid is the strongest kid I've ever seen.

307
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:39,240
He said, I've seen fully grown adults do this with being numbed and still cry.

308
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,600
And he did it without being numbed, and he was only, what, 15 at the time.

309
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,560
I'd personally be quite surprised if doctors were allowed to operate

310
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,280
on someone without any anaesthetic administered,

311
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,960
and I'm still not sure why.

312
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,320
But hey, I digress.

313
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,040
Maybe he is just an extremely strong lad.

314
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,600
There are some other interesting points, such as the information

315
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,040
that membranous nephropathy is typically found in older adults,

316
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,160
and theory that maybe he took this story from a relative I'm sure

317
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,240
has bounced around in people's minds, but that was too cynical for me.

318
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,280
As said, there are sides to this story that seem to add up.

319
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,560
So yes, this video received a lot of positive feedback and support

320
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,080
from many people within the community,

321
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,400
and it was also a video that came out just before

322
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,960
a very successful run of uploads for the brothers.

323
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,560
How consistently successful?

324
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,960
Well, I can't say, because for I know they've unlisted all the poorly performing ones.

325
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,080
However, the ones that did do well, did very well.

326
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,480
We're not just talking about 1 or 2 million views a video,

327
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,720
we're talking 10 million plus videos.

328
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,040
These videos were an eventual transition out of the Pokemon related content,

329
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,520
and represented a move to content more general.

330
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,520
Many channels couldn't make this transition,

331
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,600
but there were two factors that eased this.

332
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,360
The first one we spoke about earlier.

333
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,760
The other factor that was important to note was that

334
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,160
this new type of content didn't necessarily alienate those who subscribed for Pokemon.

335
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,200
Many people have been easily pulled in by these types of videos,

336
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,480
they have a general appeal,

337
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,640
they weren't necessarily moving from Pokemon to another specific game,

338
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,800
they were moving to a more broad genre that could still catch a viewer's attention,

339
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,640
regardless of that viewer's interests.

340
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,440
In the moment, doing this made them incredibly successful,

341
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,160
but they also took a critical hit to their staying power.

342
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,240
Back when they made videos on specific games,

343
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,160
they had the reassurance that their content

344
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,120
was likely always going to appeal to a certain audience.

345
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,280
This venture was like searching for treasure,

346
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,600
it was either incredible amounts of success,

347
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,960
or no success at all,

348
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,200
but when you keep looting the same island,

349
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,040
the returns become diminished,

350
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
and if you have no other islands to loot,

351
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,880
then the voyages become repeatedly less and less fortuitous,

352
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,720
and suddenly, all those previous voyages just don't seem so successful.

353
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,000
How could that happen?

354
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,960
Let's have a chat.

355
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,320
Many of us have an understanding of what might make an audience view our content,

356
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,040
typically the main aim is to keep people coming back.

357
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,600
A subscription is an important component of that,

358
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,880
because it shows a commitment that will subsequently have a knock-on effect

359
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,240
on the frequency that the individual sees our content in their feed,

360
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,240
however it's still only half the story.

361
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,120
I feel the lads over at Extreme Games did understand that,

362
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,320
and tried to use the anticipation yielded by multiple giveaways

363
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,040
to have people stick around longer than they normally would.

364
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,600
However, it was a fickle sense of brand loyalty,

365
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,400
mainly because people become impatient when they don't win,

366
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,440
and even if they were legitimately picking winners of these giveaways,

367
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,680
the chances of winning became much lower the larger their channel became.

368
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,760
By gaining subscribers from this method, they undermined their own appeal.

369
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,640
The idea of giveaways are a nice inclusion here and there,

370
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,840
but unless everyone legitimately believes they have a chance of winning,

371
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,960
the subscribers and views that it provides is never substantial enough to justify the technique,

372
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,440
mainly because many creators also understand

373
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,880
that you need to have people invested in your content for the long term,

374
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,360
they need to be invested in a part of you, the creator, which can be relied on.

375
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:57,640
Giveaways can't be relied on by the viewer, because they are almost completely chance-based.

376
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,000
At the time for Tom and John, it may have been hard for them to notice this,

377
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,720
behind the absolutely monumental views,

378
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,200
but they were setting up a channel that would not survive,

379
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,320
their move to broad topics made them vulnerable to a changing of the tide

380
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,080
with no real hook on the content,

381
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,680
and their giveaways were undermined by the colossal size of the viewership

382
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,680
and the alienation that came with that.

383
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,760
Eventually the views began to dwindle.

384
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,400
Once again, I can't exactly calculate the point where they drop below a reasonable threshold,

385
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,360
because they've removed a majority of the unsuccessful videos,

386
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,600
but you can see a clear trend in the ones that the brothers deem worthy to remain.

387
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,600
With the gradual decline of their views,

388
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,120
it appeared that there was no real way to switch up at this point,

389
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,560
as mentioned, to survive the evolving environment of these types of videos,

390
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,680
you either have to be accompanied with an abnormally high output rate,

391
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,880
or have something genuinely unique about your personality,

392
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,880
or the way that you conduct your content,

393
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,520
and that's something Extreme Games just did not have.

394
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,880
However, they did have one more character to introduce to this story,

395
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,320
and that was Jesus.

396
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,880
Now, the brothers had always been fond of their festivities,

397
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,160
however, on October 29th 2017,

398
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,360
the lads tweeted out that,

399
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:11,560
Now, as you probably know, I am not a man of faith,

400
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,720
however, I take no issue with anyone who finds solace within the bounds of religion.

401
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,960
Nonetheless, it did seem like a sudden wave of found faith that caught me off guard.

402
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,960
After this initial tweet, to be fair to them,

403
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,840
they did follow through with this commitment to Jesus Christ,

404
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,160
as shown by their Twitter and Instagram.

405
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,000
Guys, it's time for the bible verse of the day.

406
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,360
Johnny, what is it?

407
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,760
It is, in your relationships with one another,

408
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,560
have the same mindset as Jesus Christ.

409
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,320
That is the verse meaning pretty much,

410
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,320
what Jesus Christ does is he loves everyone,

411
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,200
and he cares for everyone, he wants the best for everyone.

412
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,400
So that's what he's saying,

413
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,040
in your mindset with one another, with your friends, with your family,

414
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,120
with anyone, just a random person on the street,

415
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,280
have that same mindset, have that same love,

416
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,000
have that same passion for everyone you meet,

417
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,920
and everything will be really awesome,

418
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,600
you'll always have a good feeling in your heart.

419
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,560
So that was Philippines chapter 2 verse 5,

420
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,760
we love you all so much,

421
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,720
and honestly guys, you guys have been giving us some really good comments,

422
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,080
and some great feedback,

423
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,600
we love you guys so much,

424
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,360
have an awesome day, have an awesome night,

425
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,120
and we'll speak to you guys again tomorrow.

426
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,440
Peace!

427
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,600
That's all well and good,

428
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,040
but I think it's pronounced Philippians rather than Philippines,

429
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,240
there's a difference between the sovereign state and the New Testament book.

430
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,840
Anyhow, pronunciation aside,

431
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,040
their commitment to Jesus Christ without necessary explanation

432
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,560
certainly came as a surprise,

433
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,440
but hey, maybe they were always passionate about Christ,

434
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,960
and just felt they could be more open about it with their audience.

435
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,960
After all, who am I to take it away from them?

436
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,280
However, there was one thing bouncing around in my head

437
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,360
that just left me with a lingering suspicion.

438
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,160
Although many find positive meaning in Christianity,

439
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,440
there is a darker side to the idea of organised religion.

440
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,720
Because its validity relies on one's own perception of belief,

441
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,920
there are a lot of individuals who will use this element of Christianity,

442
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,680
and the connection that they have with it,

443
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,680
as an element of binding loyalty.

444
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,840
This has been most often observed with maybe

445
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,080
some of the more celebrity American preachers,

446
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,720
some of whom have been exposed for preaching modesty

447
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,760
while indulging in fairly lavish behaviours themselves.

448
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,280
What happens is that basically people promote themselves as so holy

449
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,680
that people must think that they can do no wrong,

450
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,720
and then when they commit wrong, and some people may call them out,

451
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,440
they use the notion of Christianity to frame themselves as being unfairly persecuted.

452
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,960
Now I highly doubt the lads were necessarily looking at it from that perspective,

453
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,000
but one of these genres,

454
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,080
there does seem to be a real lack of strongly Christian individuals, is YouTube.

455
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,560
I'm not referring to softly spiritual individuals,

456
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,440
or even people who may identify with the Christian religion,

457
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,720
but those who preach it with the sort of fervour that these lads do.

458
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,920
Some people in this genre even receive a decent amount of stigma,

459
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,640
and some of that, I'd argue, is hard to justify.

460
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,720
I don't know why the lads made this sudden change,

461
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,640
but honestly, it felt out of place.

462
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,040
Not because I don't think you can be Christian on concept,

463
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,320
but because I didn't feel it fit into the way that they behaved.

464
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,920
And you know, maybe that's just me,

465
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,680
but I guess I don't see the preaching of deep Christian principles

466
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,040
as completely congruent with the content that they viewed as marketable,

467
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,920
and maybe that's my more judgmental side coming into play.

468
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,440
I know there's nothing specifically in the Bible about clickbaits.

469
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,960
Ultimately, when going through the stage,

470
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,720
although I have my own personal feelings,

471
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,600
if Christianity is something that they want to promote to their audience,

472
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,880
then that is fair enough.

473
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,360
They did start promoting Christianity as a concept before their overwhelming success,

474
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,840
even if it was just with the occasional tweets.

475
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:26,120
The actual Instagram videos that I showed you there were from around February in 2018,

476
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,360
which was just under a month after they had their last multi-million view video,

477
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,200
the 24 hour escape room.

478
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,080
No way!

479
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,400
Don't do that!

480
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,360
And you know what?

481
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,440
This tape is impenetrable.

482
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:38,840
What?

483
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,960
You don't believe that?

484
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,600
You know what that means?

485
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,000
What?

486
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,360
You can't break it.

487
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,560
I don't believe that.

488
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,360
Well, believe it.

489
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,760
I don't believe that.

490
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,520
I'm gonna break out, you know that, right?

491
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,240
Believe it.

492
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:49,800
I'm hungry!

493
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,800
It's lunch time and I haven't eaten!

494
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,320
Are you gonna get me some food?

495
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,160
You should have thought of that before you tried to run the joint.

496
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,360
Let me see if this stuff's real.

497
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,440
Rip fruit.

498
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,080
I'd asked how these videos received so many likes,

499
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,000
but then I realised that there was another giveaway at the start, so who cares?

500
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,240
However, there was a lingering suspicion that to me,

501
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,440
there was a deeper meaning to their Christianity,

502
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,600
and that was about to be exercised.

503
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:38,440
The thing is, whether the lads were genuinely Christian or not,

504
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,560
and they may well be,

505
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,120
there is a unique appeal to be a YouTuber who openly preaches their belief in God.

506
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,000
Once again, it promotes a level of loyalty.

507
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,680
In a way to me, it seemed like a reformulated approach of the giveaways,

508
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,920
it was a way to increase people's commitment to you

509
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,520
without offering anything additional value in the actual content,

510
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,040
because honestly, this is not really what I consider high quality.

511
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,400
Now with that said, there are many risks to promoting a specific religious doctrine.

512
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,200
You may alienate significant portions of your audience,

513
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,720
those who may identify with other religions or no religion at all.

514
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,360
However, it's important to note that the preaching that we observe

515
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,320
was pretty much confined to their Instagram and Twitter,

516
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,440
which is where you'd find their more committed audience anyway.

517
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,280
I feel this was a tactical decision,

518
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:32,520
as they were aware of the risk that inserting that into every video would ensue.

519
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,400
To me, it seemed like a way to try and gain a commitment from fans

520
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,160
who sought out their personas more passionately than the surface level audience.

521
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,200
I don't know if the brothers understand this,

522
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,520
but a key part of videos performing well is click-through rate, also known as CTR.

523
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,480
Now the problem is that if you have a large, dead channel,

524
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,280
the audiences may be advertised a video when you upload it,

525
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,640
but when none of them click it,

526
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,080
YouTube will probably decide that it's not worth promoting much further.

527
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,720
By creating a committed audience on social media,

528
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,360
they could increase CTR of the video at the start,

529
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:07,160
and boost it to additional audiences who may be drawn in by their regular giveaway formula.

530
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,640
However, one thing that they really didn't take into account

531
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,640
was the fact that the proportion of committed fans was astronomically low.

532
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:19,160
For a 4 million subscriber channel to have 13k followers on Twitter is embarrassing,

533
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,800
especially given the volume that they posted on there.

534
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,440
I think they were always trying to add a depth and commitment

535
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,520
that they themselves couldn't bring to the table,

536
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,520
and when people recognised that, they moved on, and that couldn't have felt good.

537
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:35,000
I don't think it's easy for any creator to realise that their channel isn't what it used to be.

538
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,240
There are very few creators who can maintain the spotlight for an extended length of time,

539
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,280
and even some of the larger stars have fallen rather hard,

540
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,560
and when people do fall, there are many different ways to cope with it.

541
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,840
You could quit YouTube and try and find another career,

542
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,000
you could start a new channel or change brands,

543
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,880
or you could just accept that you'll never be quite where you were,

544
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,680
and just make content for the reduced audience.

545
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,240
Of course, the brothers took none of these options,

546
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,800
but maybe they didn't have the time to consider these options

547
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,120
because before they could come to terms with this,

548
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,560
they had something else, much more horrific to come to terms with.

549
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,480
In a video called We're Quiting YouTube Because We're Dying,

550
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,720
they open up about these struggles.

551
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,400
And it's just hit a point where we literally can't do it anymore.

552
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:23,640
And it's sad because this is what we love doing,

553
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,400
this is what we love doing so much,

554
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,080
and our bodies literally can't do it anymore.

555
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,560
I know a lot of you guys are probably wondering right now what we're talking about,

556
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,240
but pretty much we're both really sick,

557
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,800
and this could be the last video that we have.

558
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,880
Oh no, what exactly is happening?

559
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,520
I've been fighting this kidney disease now for literally four years,

560
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,320
and it's finally got the best in me.

561
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,120
I can't literally fight it anymore.

562
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,400
I'm holding 16 kilos of fluid in my body,

563
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,560
and when I say fluid, it's literally because my kidneys can't filter my fluid out anymore.

564
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,920
And you know how painful it is to be locked inside your own body?

565
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,400
With all this fluid that you can't physically move, you can't eat, you're not hungry.

566
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,560
No matter what you do, you can't eat, you're not hungry at all.

567
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,280
My body's literally at the end.

568
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:24,600
It appears that Jonathan's kidney disease has returned in a much more aggressive fashion,

569
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,640
and now he is suffering from excessive amounts of fluid buildup,

570
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,280
which is affecting every aspect of his life.

571
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,120
But it doesn't stop there, as apparently Thomas has also been suffering too.

572
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,440
And every single day I wake up, it's like just absolute vertigo.

573
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,960
And if you guys don't know what vertigo is, it's like dizziness.

574
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:49,240
You know when you're on a roller coaster, you get off and everything's spinning,

575
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,280
the world is spinning.

576
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:56,200
Imagine that happening to you every single day for the entire duration of the day,

577
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,920
and it's just like on, off, on, off, on, off,

578
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,880
and you just keep getting dizzy every single day for four years.

579
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,720
That's kind of what's happened, what that is, what's happened to me.

580
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,920
And then you get acne, and then your stomach's always hurting, you vomit,

581
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:17,240
and it's just like, you kind of can't live.

582
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,760
Of absolute vertigo.

583
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,320
All right.

584
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,600
You feel like you're in a box, and you can't escape.

585
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,600
Your mind goes insane.

586
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,120
You can't breathe.

587
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:37,000
You just get so tight and worn out, and it's just like,

588
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,240
you kind of wish you could just put yourself to sleep forever, sort of thing.

589
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,880
But obviously there's no way to do that.

590
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,800
This did not appear to be good, and given their medical conditions,

591
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:52,200
it was very understandable that they would not want to continue pursuing their YouTube careers.

592
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,680
It was obviously just highly unfortunate that this coincided with a decrease in views,

593
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,920
and they were, of course, legitimately dying.

594
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,640
However, like the true province they were, they had one more important announcement to make.

595
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,880
Guys, we want to say a serious thank you to every single person that's watched our videos.

596
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,360
Seriously, all you guys out there, we love you so much.

597
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,280
And we want you to know two things.

598
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,440
First thing is we want to give back to you guys.

599
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,640
Every single one of you, we're going to hold a huge giveaway right now.

600
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,080
We're going to give away two iPhone Xs, two of them.

601
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,440
We're literally going to give away two of them.

602
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,200
That's how much we love you guys.

603
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,400
And all you got to do is literally like this video,

604
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,520
turn on notifications on our channel, and subscribe.

605
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,720
And that's it.

606
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,480
And you're entered into the giveaway.

607
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,360
We're giving one last giveaway just because we seriously want to give back,

608
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,080
because we honestly love you all so much.

609
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,960
That's the first thing.

610
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,920
Second thing is we want you to know Jesus Christ loves you too.

611
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:45,960
Wow.

612
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,400
Give them a round of applause.

613
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,960
It was a moment of true selflessness.

614
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,200
These individuals, dying of their ailments,

615
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,520
found it in their hearts to once more give back to a community that has supported them.

616
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,480
It's a sort of generosity that just brings you to tears.

617
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,520
You love to see it.

618
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,800
However, if you were watching the video and became slightly suspicious,

619
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,240
then you know what?

620
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,320
You might have justified reason because they go into depth regarding their suffering,

621
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,760
and it just becomes a bit implausible.

622
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,000
Imagine for four years you're feeling sick, dizzy, vomiting,

623
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,640
and your stomach feels like it's practically a volcano.

624
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,480
And you go doctor after doctor, hospital after hospital,

625
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,520
and they all keep telling you there's nothing wrong with you.

626
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,680
Um, that's what's happened to me.

627
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,080
In fact, if they were suffering to the extent that they were,

628
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,120
how come they've had the strength to fly all the way to America?

629
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:50,280
How did any airline let them do that without them acquiring some special permission?

630
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:55,240
They then must have recorded and edited and subsequently uploaded this video,

631
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,440
not looking particularly different to any of their other videos.

632
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,480
In fact, if they'd been suffering so badly over the months prior,

633
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,320
what made them so capable to record multiple videos often?

634
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,200
We'd seen very little symptoms demonstrated on screen,

635
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,480
and although a person would obviously avoid showing those symptoms,

636
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,760
the frequency of their upload suggested they would have struggled

637
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,480
if this illness was as severe as they framed it.

638
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,080
But they had one more hope.

639
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,280
We've got this one doctor,

640
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,440
and we've done a lot of like,

641
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,040
we've been researching literally for hours on end

642
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,880
to try and figure out how we're gonna get better.

643
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:42,120
And we found this one man by the name of Dr. John Bergman,

644
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,960
and he's our last hope.

645
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,240
He's literally our last chance.

646
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,240
He's our last chance at being us again.

647
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,120
He's our last chance at living again.

648
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,680
Well, two more hopes.

649
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,240
With the power of you guys,

650
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,080
with the power of us,

651
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,920
and the power of Jesus,

652
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,680
Jesus Christ,

653
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,240
and God,

654
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,760
we'll be able to do this, I think.

655
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,480
So right now,

656
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,200
all you guys watching this video

657
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,760
will want to ask one thing from you guys,

658
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,520
is that you close your eyes and you make a prayer for us

659
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,440
through the name of Jesus Christ.

660
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,520
Because if you guys do that for us,

661
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,880
I know we'll get better,

662
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,920
and I know we'll heal.

663
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:29,960
Ah.

664
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,760
With the upload of the video,

665
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,800
there was an outpouring of support and sympathy

666
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,480
from all sorts of audiences,

667
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,400
although once again, the record on the video is quite unclear.

668
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,760
We do know that after upload,

669
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,920
they were receiving a lot of likes and comments

670
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,920
that seemed to be believing in their nature.

671
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,400
This screenshot shows that their like dislike ratio

672
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,960
was around 95% at that point.

673
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,680
It was a video that would generate that sort of support,

674
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,960
particularly from audiences

675
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,320
who may have become acquainted with them in previous videos.

676
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,680
If they're naive enough to be roped in by the giveaways and clickbait,

677
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,520
then someone talking to them about dying is probably just as believable,

678
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,880
particularly considering that many people would be hesitant to call them out,

679
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,080
telling someone who might be going through an excessive amount of suffering

680
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,120
that they're faking it,

681
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,440
or exaggerating it might be sketchy,

682
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,720
and you wouldn't want to agree with someone already suffering like that.

683
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,680
However, not everyone conforms to that formula,

684
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,080
in fact, there's always one person who doesn't,

685
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,000
the commentator.

686
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,720
In this instance, the bold individual who shed the most light onto this was Leon Lush,

687
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,960
although he was rather sensitive to the possibility

688
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,760
that these gentlemen may be suffering from some sort of illness,

689
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,000
he decided to take the side as skepticism,

690
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,040
especially given the very ham-fisted giveaway.

691
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,200
A giveaway in your We're Dying video,

692
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,920
where people have to like and subscribe and turn notifications on

693
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,480
to stay updated and see if they won the giveaway

694
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,240
in your We're Fucking Dying video?

695
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,360
I'll tell you what, it's a good thing I'm a detective,

696
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,160
because it's a red flag right here,

697
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,000
this is a fucking red mother,

698
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,200
this flag is redder,

699
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,880
I just cannot.

700
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,600
It was interesting because I had watched so many extreme games videos at that point,

701
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,760
that although the giveaway would be rightfully viewed as inappropriate by many people,

702
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,120
I was just numb to it,

703
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,600
and I knew that even if they were genuinely dying,

704
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,240
they'd probably still do this thing regardless.

705
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,760
However, for many viewers, particularly the more commentary oriented ones,

706
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,760
this was a tell-all sign these guys weren't being the most honest.

707
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,280
The more obvious point for me was that if these guys were planning to quit YouTube

708
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,320
because they were dying,

709
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,800
then they wouldn't care if people subscribed to their channel.

710
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,600
As noted earlier, subscriptions are not an accurate way to measure entry into these competitions,

711
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,160
as many people don't have their subscriptions public,

712
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:57,000
and the reason to increase subscriptions is therefore completely self-motivated,

713
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,040
but if they were dying, there would be no motivation to do that.

714
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,640
The confusion was furthered when the lads updated the timeline by making this video,

715
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,440
in which he performed a cover of a photograph by Ed Sheeran,

716
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,600
which I know will be copyright claimed if I play,

717
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,000
so nice bait lads, I'm not falling for it.

718
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,800
Nonetheless, the tone of this video is pretty dramatic.

719
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,680
Guys, the doctor just told us...

720
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,680
that Johnny's got four weeks to live.

721
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,360
He doesn't deserve this.

722
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:33,000
But I of course understand why you'd be so upset given the dire circumstances.

723
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,680
So yes, he's dying, but suddenly,

724
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,880
they're sat at a lovely Riviera promoting another giveaway,

725
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,960
and this time, the doctor's involved.

726
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,160
We also want you guys to know that the doctor that we're going to right now,

727
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,680
we found him from YouTube,

728
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,520
so we want you guys to check out his YouTube channel and subscribe to him.

729
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,960
If you subscribe to his channel,

730
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,520
you're gonna double your chances at winning this giveaway.

731
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,120
So who is this doctor?

732
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,000
The doctor's name is John Bergman, he is a chiropractor.

733
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Now, I don't want to decry chiropractors,

734
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,640
because I do actually know a fair few people in my life

735
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,400
who have been significantly helped by them.

736
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,840
In fact, I think I might need to take a trip to one eventually myself.

737
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:10,280
However, I would stress that if you are dying of kidney failure,

738
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,240
a chiropractor probably will not cure you.

739
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,720
The fact also stands for severe vertigo,

740
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,880
and given the severity of their illnesses,

741
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:22,120
I'm just concerned they were completely unaccompanied in this journey to America.

742
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,760
I mean, it all seems a little far-fetched.

743
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,520
The point is not that they were not ill,

744
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,280
but that they were clearly not dying,

745
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,800
and that in both of their instances,

746
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,560
the video stating that, you know,

747
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,400
one of them may have four weeks left to live seemed ridiculous and manipulative.

748
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,360
Why would they do this?

749
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:40,440
Well, the first reason is one that I believe is fairly easy to state, views.

750
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,960
As noted at the start of the video,

751
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,000
we tend to follow people's battles with illness quite closely,

752
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,200
and we like to show our support and feel like we're making a difference.

753
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,160
Therefore, these things generate a lot of attention.

754
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,080
Secondly, well subscriber loyalty.

755
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,440
Once again, these creators are trying to create a connection with their audience

756
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,920
on the basis of experiences that they are going through,

757
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,880
rather than anything actually relating to their personality.

758
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,880
The thing is that any regular conduct that is morally justifiable to make videos about

759
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,720
probably has already made videos on them,

760
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,080
and probably better videos,

761
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:13,240
and therefore these creators need to push the boundaries in a way that most people wouldn't.

762
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,520
In fact, this development ties quite nicely into their previous content,

763
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,960
which was also based around doing what people were not prepared to do.

764
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,440
It's just the reasons that most people weren't prepared to do it

765
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,120
are quite different this time around.

766
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,360
The third reason is because, as mentioned earlier,

767
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,120
people are much more hesitant to call people who may be faking these things out,

768
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,240
in case they were wrong.

769
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,280
This meant that there was a higher chance of them getting away with this.

770
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,080
If people did call them out, well, how dare you?

771
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,920
You could drive them to suicide.

772
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,880
Now I know that a lot of you guys would be saying that you can't die from this,

773
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,520
but you can.

774
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,600
How many people have died from depression?

775
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,040
How many people have died from anxiety and stress?

776
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,880
It just pushes you to a point,

777
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,360
when everyone's telling you that you're not telling the truth,

778
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,440
it pushes you to a point in your mental state,

779
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,160
where you can just suicide, you can do anything.

780
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,720
And honestly, I'm not the kind of person that would suicide,

781
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,720
because I have Jesus Christ in my life,

782
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,440
I would never suicide, no matter what pain I'm ever going through,

783
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,280
suicide is never the option.

784
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,720
But I'm just saying that that is the point where it was getting to,

785
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,960
and my mental state was not stable at all from this sickness.

786
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,320
And the other point that they continued to push was Dr. Bergman.

787
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:21,080
All you got to do to enter this giveaway is subscribe to Dr. Bergman,

788
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,200
because we want you guys not only to enter a giveaway,

789
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,640
you could win an awesome iPhone,

790
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,200
but you will also learn the truth about health,

791
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,680
because he knows every single answer to the sickness,

792
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,480
he knows a cure to cancer, he knows a cure to liver disease,

793
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,520
he knows a cure to kidney disease, he knows a cure to everything.

794
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,520
You guys are acting like he's just a chiropractor,

795
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,920
but trust me, he is much more than a chiropractor,

796
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,920
he is a genius, he knows everything to do with healing the human body.

797
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,720
So we urge you right now, go subscribe to him,

798
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,720
go click his videos, because he knows the truth.

799
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,520
I'm not entirely sure why they did this,

800
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,680
maybe they had some agreement with the doctor,

801
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,720
but then pushing the narrative that actually Dr. John Bergman

802
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,000
could cure any illness may have appeared funny to us,

803
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,480
but it actually could have been quite sinister.

804
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,600
Let's talk about that more.

805
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,120
I don't know what the alternative timeline was for these creators,

806
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,640
prior to people like Leon Lurch throwing a spanner in the works,

807
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,400
but by the end of the response video,

808
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,240
I came to the conclusion that whatever was going on was some kind of scam.

809
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,560
In this video, we know you guys know the truth,

810
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,240
we know you guys believe in us,

811
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,480
we know you guys know what is actually going on with our bodies and with our lives,

812
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,200
and we're gonna keep filling you guys in as much as possible.

813
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,600
Honestly, Dr. Bergman is starting to show some crazy improvement on our bodies,

814
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,640
we're going to him three times a day, every single day,

815
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,520
working on ourselves, trying to get ourselves fixed and healed,

816
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,200
and a scam is a strong word,

817
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,000
but at the end of the day they were promoting this chiropractor

818
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,120
as the individual who could cure all these illnesses.

819
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,760
When that sort of statement is blatantly false,

820
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,160
and it's easy to point at them and laugh at their complete ignorance in these statements,

821
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:31,880
but those statements were made when they were under a lot of scrutiny and pressure.

822
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,560
If no one had really challenged them,

823
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:37,800
and they had exercised their significant influence over a fairly gullible fanbase,

824
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,680
they could have spread some legitimately harmful messages.

825
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:44,440
I don't doubt that there may be some legitimate illness that Jonathan may be encountering,

826
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,320
and the evidence that there are some symptoms is very clear,

827
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,880
but that does not suffice for the argument that you are making,

828
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,880
which is much more preachy and radical.

829
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,480
You are not just claiming that you are dying,

830
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,480
you are promoting general doubt of a system,

831
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,760
albeit not perfect,

832
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,760
that has done a lot of good for many people,

833
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:02,280
while promoting this single individual as some sort of miracle worker.

834
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,120
I also thought it was funny that they would have agreed to go on an interview with Keemstar,

835
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,920
but under the premise that they would know the questions before,

836
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,680
which obviously didn't come to a head

837
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,960
because they had no confidence in their narrative under further scrutiny,

838
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,000
especially live.

839
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,120
When people are suffering from an illness, they may become desperate,

840
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,560
they are definitely vulnerable,

841
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,800
particularly when looking for possible cures.

842
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,720
Now as said, during the first video I have become so numb to their giveaways

843
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:30,600
that they didn't even seem out of place in this much more sensitive content.

844
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,880
In the two year old video where they talk about Jonathan's kidney condition,

845
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,480
they do exactly the same thing.

846
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,000
Who else would be completely used to Extreme Games' type of content?

847
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,960
The core audience, the fanbase, the people who actually choose to click on every video,

848
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,880
what happens when they hear these two guys talking about how they're dying,

849
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,080
and how their last hope is this chiropract in California,

850
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,880
and I'm not saying that an overwhelming number of people

851
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,480
would be influenced by this sort of propaganda, which is what it is,

852
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,240
but we've all been in situations where we've been looking for some sort of miracle,

853
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,800
and whether knowingly or not they have asserted to provide an answer to that.

854
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,280
In the original video this message was more subtle,

855
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,760
but under pressure they cracked, that sounded like a pair of rather unhinged individuals.

856
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,920
It is a scam, that's what it is.

857
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:19,960
As noted, they also integrated the giveaway with a subscription to Dr John Bergman's channel,

858
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,840
which once again is extremely impractical for multiple reasons,

859
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:26,280
and something that a channel that size would not be able to organise,

860
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,960
especially if they were dying.

861
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:32,120
I know many people may be more focused on the aspect that they were trying to gain subs from

862
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,720
a video in which they talk about their impending death through giveaways,

863
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,920
but I'm more annoyed at the fact that they emotionally manipulated people

864
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,000
into thinking that they were about to die,

865
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,320
and then presented the solution as this miracle doctor who you should all subscribe to.

866
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,800
It's unhealthy and pretty dangerous.

867
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,960
I feel that if uninterrupted, they probably would have followed this treatment through,

868
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,120
claimed to have been cured, and then used that emotional victory to try and sell the practice

869
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,680
as further credibility for this chiropractor,

870
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:03,000
as well as winning over all these fans who were ardently rousing for them to come through.

871
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,400
I can't tell you if this plan would have worked,

872
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,160
to be honest I'm kinda skeptical,

873
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,200
but it was good that people did actually step in and say something,

874
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,440
and actually point out what was wrong.

875
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,080
Also, to add on to my two narratives here,

876
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,880
the other character that has made appearances in these videos

877
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,680
was our lord and saviour Jesus Christ.

878
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,000
Before we literally prove anything to anyone,

879
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,440
what we wanna say first of all is,

880
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:28,280
we forgive every single one of you guys that has created a hate video on us.

881
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,560
Every single comment,

882
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,240
every single thing that any of you have said,

883
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,120
we forgive you,

884
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,960
because that's what Jesus Christ would do.

885
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:34,760
He would forgive you,

886
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,440
he would forgive you no matter what you've done to him if you go to him for forgiveness,

887
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,520
and that's exactly what we're gonna do to you guys,

888
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,840
cause Jesus Christ lives inside of us,

889
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,720
and we forgive every single person that's created hate on us.

890
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,720
However, it wasn't until two months later when they made their post recovery video

891
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,240
that the truth becomes clear.

892
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,920
Now this is the one video that I do not actually have the original copy of,

893
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:59,640
so I'll just use the Leon Lush reaction video to both summarise exactly how I feel

894
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,600
about their rhetoric,

895
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,080
and suitably deliver the tone of the video.

896
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,640
The person that has been there all this time,

897
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,640
that we should have had our faith in,

898
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,440
not doctors,

899
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,280
not specialists,

900
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,640
not anyone of this world,

901
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,040
the person that we have put our faith into,

902
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,040
his name is Jesus Christ.

903
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,040
Now that is what we have done just recently,

904
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:22,040
we have literally put our sicknesses into Jesus Christ's hands,

905
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,800
and as you guys know if you've read the bible,

906
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,560
or if you know anything about Jesus,

907
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,680
he's a healer.

908
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,320
He can heal you cause he is the son of God.

909
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,440
He can do miracles and literally do whatever he wants.

910
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,920
So we have put our faith in him and I tell you right now,

911
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,560
yes I might still have a little bit of oedema left,

912
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,280
but I feel no pain.

913
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,800
It was in fact Jesus,

914
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,840
Jesus healed them,

915
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,760
Jesus was the person all along,

916
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,080
in fact they didn't need any doctors at all,

917
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:47,720
after all,

918
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:51,960
those are the same doctors who had told Thomas that there was in fact nothing wrong with him.

919
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,600
The only authority that you should trust is Jesus,

920
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,280
and Jesus has made the conscious decision to heal those suffering gentlemen.

921
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:02,520
Praise the Lord and his random healings of vertigo through California chiropractors.

922
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,320
Now as mentioned,

923
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,720
the lads have been promoting Christianity for a while,

924
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,720
but here is one of the times where it seems to have been used for a less than benign purpose.

925
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,920
Sometimes when people are down,

926
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,640
bringing religion into their lives can legitimately help them,

927
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:18,360
and I might even go as far to say the emotional uplift that religion can provide for some people

928
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:21,160
might aid people's fight against certain illnesses.

929
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:21,640
However,

930
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,520
to me it seems like it's been used as a scapegoat here,

931
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,400
as a way to explain how they have managed to heal themselves,

932
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,600
and definitely to try and create a connection with the Christian crowd

933
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,840
who will brand this as some miracle healing,

934
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,560
and as proof that God does in fact exist.

935
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:38,680
They have created this perfect arc where they were all going to die,

936
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,200
they needed all this support,

937
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,160
and when they had it they made a miraculous recovery,

938
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,360
thanks to Dr. John Bergman and Jesus Christ.

939
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,160
Amen.

940
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,440
In the video they also state that their DMs are open on Instagram,

941
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,440
and they are there to spread the message of God,

942
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,840
and if you are interested you should reach out to them.

943
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:59,560
This was basically a way of reaching out to the right audience who may be brought into this story,

944
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,360
and believe me,

945
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,720
although few and far between,

946
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,480
they're definitely out there.

947
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,600
Johnny and Tommy,

948
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,960
you guys are amazing people,

949
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,680
and for those of you who think they're pretending to be sick,

950
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,320
screw you,

951
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,720
cause these guys are strong believers in Christ,

952
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,720
and they help me get through a lot,

953
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,960
I know I can go to them whenever I need them,

954
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:16,760
thank you.

955
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,320
Now,

956
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:17,800
once again,

957
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,240
if they're helping people,

958
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:19,800
you know,

959
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,160
I can't take that away from them,

960
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,120
but overall,

961
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,360
as a greater cultural effect,

962
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,320
I class these escapades as hope baiting,

963
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,880
it's basically telling people that there are all these solutions

964
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,560
that can be found in places that they need to just put their faith in,

965
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,640
this problem solving entity,

966
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,960
I feel that they are basically trying to couple themselves to that notion of hope

967
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,000
with the intention of winning back an audience from the brink,

968
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,280
which as Leon notes,

969
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,480
wasn't the most hopeful.

970
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,200
But it does seem awfully convenient,

971
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:48,920
you know what I mean?

972
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,360
Eight weeks ago we were dying,

973
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:50,920
definitely,

974
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,040
we're not lying about that,

975
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:52,920
we were gonna die,

976
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,480
vertigo,

977
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,600
leaky gut,

978
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:54,920
dead.

979
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,560
JC hooked it up bro,

980
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,040
JC came through in the clutch,

981
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:00,840
not dead anymore,

982
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:01,160
in fact,

983
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,360
we're feeling great,

984
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,040
be sure to like and subscribe.

985
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,640
But was it all that simple?

986
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:09,080
Was it just two guys using a load of shit to try and keep their channel afloat,

987
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,880
or were they a bit more invested in it than I thought?

988
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,840
Let's take a look back and try to come to a conclusion.

989
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:42,120
I mean the one point in their favour is that they started preaching about their closeness to Jesus

990
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,800
during their channel hire point,

991
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:49,080
and therefore it seems unlikely that they just had conjured up this belief of Jesus for the sake of views.

992
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,640
Maybe they did view their success as a miracle,

993
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,200
I mean,

994
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,560
I can understand why.

995
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,400
I wouldn't put it down to Jesus though,

996
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,800
I'd put it down to some rather crafty clickbait,

997
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,280
which I'm not sure Jesus would approve of to be honest,

998
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,760
though I haven't spoken to him so I can't confirm.

999
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,680
Looking back at their history,

1000
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,920
they've really done anything to succeed,

1001
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,680
whether that was completely transforming their channel branding to a Pokemon channel,

1002
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,400
and then basically acting like that phase never happened,

1003
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,520
the only thing that remained remotely consistent was their giveaways,

1004
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,240
and in effect,

1005
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,520
I can understand why.

1006
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,960
And this is the strange thing,

1007
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,200
although they changed their content in and out,

1008
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,480
they clearly never really identified the content with the success,

1009
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,000
they identified the giveaways,

1010
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,200
because the giveaways were what provided them these subscriptions,

1011
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,040
the content was just filler to them,

1012
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,840
and the reason that I think they look at it from that perspective

1013
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,000
is because of how they use the Christian faith.

1014
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,040
When someone's channel begins to fail,

1015
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,040
they grip onto a formula more tightly,

1016
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,840
they try and use the same tricks to a greater extent,

1017
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,440
and you can see this with the land,

1018
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,840
both in their view of religion and giveaways,

1019
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,360
these are the only two things that seem to increase in their intensity

1020
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,040
when their channels begin to fail,

1021
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,680
they put their success in giveaways and Jesus,

1022
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,280
so when it begins to fall flat,

1023
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,440
they create a greater investment in it.

1024
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,320
Honestly, if they thought they could get away with crediting giveaways

1025
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,360
for saving their lives,

1026
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,720
then they probably would.

1027
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,880
That's exactly why their channel died,

1028
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,320
even if they haven't.

1029
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,680
If you want to keep people watching,

1030
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,600
you need to have faith in your content,

1031
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,800
not concepts that are mostly separate to what you're creating.

1032
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,880
Careers are seldom built on gimmicks,

1033
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,200
they're built on fleshed out characters who we appreciate

1034
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,640
not because of what happens to them,

1035
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,600
but because of how they react to their environments and evolve.

1036
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,960
Someone fighting a life threatening illness can be extremely riveting,

1037
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,480
but only because of how they respond to the battle that they are fighting.

1038
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,680
It's about character,

1039
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:35,560
and I guarantee that even if they had sold it to people,

1040
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,160
they wouldn't have revived their channel

1041
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,000
because they didn't show the character of someone

1042
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,080
who was genuinely going through those struggles.

1043
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,120
They may have found Jesus,

1044
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,960
but they haven't found the moral compass

1045
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,480
that many religious individuals would argue should come with him.

1046
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,120
It's the worst brand of religious exploitation.

1047
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,040
Jesus is the ultimate authority,

1048
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,520
and he helped us heal because he did.

1049
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,480
It's bizarre.

1050
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,280
It's a con.

1051
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,200
They're trying to connect people like that,

1052
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,360
and I just do not stand.

1053
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,560
And I'm no fan of religion,

1054
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,080
but I accept that, on principle,

1055
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,760
it has a moral compass,

1056
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:09,160
and I don't believe there's any way for these guys to remain inside the Christian moral compass,

1057
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,840
given the way that they have behaved,

1058
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:13,320
which leads me to believe that they're moral licenses,

1059
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,800
people who basically identify with these causes

1060
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,560
to make themselves feel better about not necessarily practicing what they preach.

1061
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,120
Maybe they're trying to justify it to themselves as well,

1062
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,600
but really, looking at it from a removed perspective,

1063
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,440
it could have been much worse than it was.

1064
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,880
People called it out early,

1065
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:31,800
and therefore the dissemination of a potentially harmful doctrine was suppressed,

1066
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,760
but they still have a responsibility for the intent,

1067
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,720
which they retained, as shown by their response video.

1068
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:38,680
Trust us, guys.

1069
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,360
They have removed these videos since,

1070
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,680
as said, they seem to enjoy removing content,

1071
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,600
but they haven't formally commented on it.

1072
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,680
If they do regret it, well, okay,

1073
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,600
it's not that I'm not willing to hear them out.

1074
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,400
In the instance that they were just really invested in this treatment,

1075
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,840
which I feel is unlikely,

1076
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,200
maybe they're not bad people,

1077
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,040
but what they did was excessively reckless and irrational considering their fanbase,

1078
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,280
and how impressible many of them seemed at the time.

1079
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:04,600
You don't deserve to have that responsibility given the possible repercussions.

1080
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,080
That fanbase was built from the start on giveaways,

1081
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:10,520
whether they were giving away a Clash of Clans account or an iPhone.

1082
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,720
You need to have some beggar's belief to sign up to a channel for that,

1083
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:14,680
and given that to me,

1084
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,800
they seem to be convinced that the giveaways are a catch to the channel,

1085
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,520
they had to know the audience that they were trying to rope in

1086
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,520
with a much more consequential narrative.

1087
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:27,560
Now, normally this would be the part where I talk about how their channel has died,

1088
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,000
due to these escapades,

1089
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,480
but also due to the fact that they could not evolve,

1090
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,640
which seemed to be a constant block for them.

1091
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,920
However, ironically, and maybe even depressingly,

1092
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,240
they've revived their channel very recently,

1093
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,760
and that is the problem with YouTube,

1094
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,840
there would be people who just don't know,

1095
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,400
especially when you make flavourless content.

1096
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,720
That was the problem with someone like Austin Jones,

1097
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:51,240
even though, of course, that was much, much more serious.

1098
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,520
Very briefly, after YouTube introduced abbreviated subscriber counts,

1099
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,080
you can see the ugly, rounded up number jump up

1100
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:00,520
in a way that it hasn't for maybe over a year at least.

1101
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:03,560
Basically, what they're doing now is a rip-off of more content,

1102
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,280
I mean, they even put Morgz in the tags of their videos,

1103
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:09,640
and given that Morgz is a rip-off of, like, five other YouTubers,

1104
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,200
it's hard to really argue that they've learned anything,

1105
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,880
they're just following the paper trail.

1106
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:14,760
What's in this?

1107
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,000
I'm genuinely shocked, I don't know what's in either of these.

1108
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,040
It's like it's Christmas before Christmas, Johnny, what is next?

1109
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,000
It's your turn!

1110
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,440
Alright, here we go then!

1111
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,400
No!

1112
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,280
It's a twin!

1113
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,320
That's not Christmas, is it?

1114
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,040
No!

1115
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,480
Not the most charismatic,

1116
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,680
although if they're not selling miracle cures to gullible audiences,

1117
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,040
I guess it's an improvement.

1118
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,240
Asking them to make decent content would probably be a step too far.

1119
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,840
I still feel that their behaviour will be fresh in some people's memories,

1120
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,640
given how forgettable they are for basically anything else,

1121
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,400
and they will never immortalise themselves in a way that other individuals can,

1122
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,320
because they coast on clickbait alone,

1123
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,280
and the fact that one video can get over a million views back to back

1124
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,520
with another video that barely cracks 50,000 is at least somewhat reassuring.

1125
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:58,280
However, their lack of personality is probably why they've had a spike in success again,

1126
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,880
because they are so damn forgettable,

1127
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,200
people probably forgot this whole charade,

1128
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,120
especially when they erased the history.

1129
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:08,040
Nonetheless, for the first time ever, they seem to have let go of old habits,

1130
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,080
there are no giveaways,

1131
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,720
and they may have finally clocked that successful content

1132
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,280
is not dependent on the number of giveaways you do.

1133
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,960
Maybe they just had to let go,

1134
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,360
which is something that they never could do before.

1135
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:21,080
If you wanna win an iPhone 11, we might be giving one away.

1136
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,080
Oh, never mind.

1137
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,640
Wait, we might be giving one away?

1138
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,080
Yes, an iPhone 11.

1139
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,080
They've really outdone themselves this time.

1140
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,800
I think on that bombshell, it's best to conclude.

1141
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:37,400
Extreme Games' breakdown was strange in a way that it was a sign of a dying channel

1142
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,680
trying to use old techniques to an insane extent,

1143
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:44,440
but also the attempt of a channel to understand what that means

1144
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,280
in the most tasteless way possible.

1145
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,840
They're constantly trying to retain the aspects of a channel

1146
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,680
with a greater connection with their fans,

1147
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,080
but their genre will never permit that.

1148
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,440
They will never be those sorts of creators, even if they die.

1149
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,880
They have to understand the humanity behind individuals

1150
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,800
and why we care about their lives.

1151
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,640
If you build your career on clickbait,

1152
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,960
we will never know enough about who you truly are

1153
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,680
to understand how you interpret your own struggles,

1154
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:12,120
and that's something Extreme Games could never really comprehend,

1155
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,360
how to market their own humanity.

1156
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,280
And it seems they've come to terms with it,

1157
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,360
and are now as successful as ever.

1158
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,000
It's just a shame that the journey to that destination

1159
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,400
has been pretty manipulative and destructive.

1160
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,000
I pray to God it was worth it.

1161
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,080
So yes, that was the video, I hope you enjoyed.

1162
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,760
It was an interesting one to script, certainly a bit longer than I anticipated,

1163
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,520
but that's what happens sometimes.

1164
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,600
I really want to give a big shout out to the editors,

1165
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,920
they've done a fantastic job, I am sure,

1166
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,720
and I would not have it any other way.

1167
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,320
I would also like to give a big thanks to my Patreons,

1168
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,640
$10 Patreons on the screen right now,

1169
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:52,360
give a special thanks to my $50 Patreons,

1170
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,360
Somehuller Blue, The Specter Angel,

1171
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:58,120
Bowright, Nico Deschamps, Sarah Elizabeth and Caroline,

1172
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:01,560
and a very special thanks to my $100 Patreons,

1173
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,200
Brandon, Adam Michael, and Christopher Karas.

1174
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,480
My Twitter is at The Right Opinion,

1175
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,320
my Facebook The Right Opinion Official,

1176
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,360
and my Discord, they're all linked in the pinned comment,

1177
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:16,040
and if you have any other questions then feel free to hit me up there.

1178
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,640
I hope you're having a wonderful day,

1179
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,080
my go is going fairly average,

1180
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,360
but hopefully something interesting can happen in my life soon enough,

1181
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,200
I know I've been waiting long enough.

1182
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,200
Anyhow, I don't really have much to add,

1183
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,440
so I'll leave it here, I'm The Right Opinion,

1184
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,840
and I will see you in the next one.
