00:00.000 --> 00:08.680
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

00:08.680 --> 00:12.440
and there are many ways that celebrities may immortalise themselves in popular culture,

00:12.440 --> 00:17.680
maybe they pioneered a defining industry, maybe they released a series of critically acclaimed albums,

00:17.680 --> 00:24.560
or maybe they died young. I know that was a bit of an abrupt segue, but there is a morbid fascination we have

00:24.560 --> 00:28.360
with celebrities who didn't necessarily bow out in the most graceful fashion,

00:28.400 --> 00:33.640
when someone with such great potential and apparent success is victim to the tragedy of a premature demise,

00:33.640 --> 00:38.560
particularly those of artificial sorts, we're left thinking about what might have been for that individual,

00:38.560 --> 00:42.760
and we're also encouraged to reflect on the industry that may have manufactured such an outcome.

00:42.760 --> 00:47.480
Now make no mistake, some of these individuals were incredibly prolific regardless of their depth,

00:47.480 --> 00:51.880
and you don't want to overstate their depth as if to take away from their artistic contribution,

00:51.880 --> 00:55.880
but when someone passes away, that contribution is often frozen in that moment,

00:55.880 --> 01:00.440
and we are drawn to the attention of what that death has taken away from us as individuals.

01:00.440 --> 01:05.080
A really great example of that was Stefan Karl Steffensen, the guy who played Robbie Rotten,

01:05.080 --> 01:09.320
and provided me and many others with the numerous memes that yielded from We Are Number One.

01:09.320 --> 01:16.200
His diagnosis, recovery, relapse, and eventual death was an emotional rollercoaster that many people were on all the way,

01:16.200 --> 01:20.200
but his death reflected something else. Because we were there throughout the situation,

01:20.200 --> 01:25.080
we had time to provide our support to someone we loved. Popular individuals dying prematurely

01:25.080 --> 01:31.080
is not the most common event, and often what is even rarer is being able to foresee the possibility of that death,

01:31.080 --> 01:37.400
as many people don't go public about it, and therefore the journey to that destination is often a fight we want to be there for.

01:37.400 --> 01:42.280
There's an emotional battle that gives us purpose, to know that we might make a difference in that battle.

01:42.280 --> 01:47.640
Therefore, it was natural that when people found out that today's subjects were dying, they wanted to show their support.

01:47.640 --> 01:52.360
Who are those subjects? Well, they are a pair of YouTubers by the name of Xtreme Games,

01:52.360 --> 01:59.240
the Australian brothers of Thomas and Jonathan, who do what you want to see, have fun, play games, and chill.

01:59.240 --> 02:04.120
They describe their content as family friendly, and kid friendly, and in their five years on YouTube,

02:04.120 --> 02:10.440
they've built up a fairly sturdy subscriber count of 4.24 million, and over 314 million views.

02:10.440 --> 02:16.200
Pretty impressive. Where did those views come from? Well, who remembers Pro Gamer Jay? No one?

02:16.200 --> 02:21.240
Well, let me refresh your memory. A couple years back, he was the punching bag for many commentators

02:21.240 --> 02:27.320
who found his content a bit, well, laughable. He was notorious for rather misleading, albeit amusing, clickbait.

02:27.320 --> 02:32.920
His most well known was a video that was titled, If You See Red Then You Are Colorblind, or Words To That Effect,

02:32.920 --> 02:37.080
as he has changed it since then, the cheeky bugger. However, although many people picked on him,

02:37.080 --> 02:42.120
maybe due to his delivery, he was part of a greater trend that was represented by multiple creators,

02:42.120 --> 02:47.080
even to this day, that rated the power of leading your audience to believe that they were doing something

02:47.080 --> 02:50.360
with higher stakes than what actually happened in the video.

02:50.360 --> 02:54.360
Now, with that said, a lot of these channels specialised in various areas of clickbait.

02:54.360 --> 02:58.840
There was obviously a significant amount of overlap, but they all occupied various corners.

02:58.840 --> 03:03.560
Honestly, these videos should have died out much faster than they did, but some have, in fact, persisted.

03:03.560 --> 03:08.120
The ones who have either grew into the creative maestros, such as Mr. Beast, who actually followed through

03:08.120 --> 03:14.040
on their clickbaits, or a level of uninspired irony that I and other audiences appear still to be attempting

03:14.040 --> 03:16.840
to understand, such as Mork's.

03:16.840 --> 03:24.760
Guys, I'm so close, but I'm just not sure what the item is. What could come after B-O-O?

03:24.760 --> 03:32.360
Wait a minute! Book! I guessed the letter K! Guys, what could that final letter be?

03:32.360 --> 03:36.760
A math book! A mal book! A mad book! A mad book!

03:36.760 --> 03:41.560
However, many of these creators also lost a lot of traction, with the introduction of corporate channels

03:41.560 --> 03:46.120
like Brightside, who can just pump out these dire informational videos on a regular basis.

03:46.120 --> 03:50.680
Many individual creators realised that they couldn't compete, and only channels who were doing things

03:50.680 --> 03:53.640
that weren't just based on clickbait managed to survive.

03:53.640 --> 03:58.760
Extreme Games were one of the channels that appeared to have gained most of their prominence off this trend initially.

03:58.760 --> 04:03.800
Although they clearly had some presence prior to two years ago, this is the only content that really is still

04:03.800 --> 04:07.880
accessible on their channel. In fact, one of the things that I found while researching their videos

04:07.880 --> 04:11.000
is that they removed them at an unbelievably high rate.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
However, like many channels around this time, Extreme Games were the victim to the demise of that brand of content.

04:17.000 --> 04:24.200
Extreme Games at their peak seemed to specialise in Nerf gun mods, DIY fidget spinners, and DIY Nerf guns.

04:24.200 --> 04:27.720
Basically mixing and matching various trends at that point.

04:27.720 --> 04:31.880
Now, there's been worse clickbait to be honest, but it became very clear that people were not going to be won over

04:31.880 --> 04:36.920
by the concept of lava fidget spinners forever, and eventually their views began to fall.

04:36.920 --> 04:40.360
Like many channels that coasted on the clickbait rather than the content,

04:40.360 --> 04:43.240
people did not stick around when those topics lost their charm.

04:43.240 --> 04:46.600
It didn't help that they were not the most charismatic of individuals.

04:46.600 --> 04:49.720
That is literally an apple fidget spinner.

04:49.720 --> 04:52.920
Oh man! We just made a fidget spinner out of an apple!

04:52.920 --> 04:55.640
And the cool thing is, if you're hungry, you can just take a bite from it.

04:55.640 --> 04:58.600
Who would have honestly thought that, ever? That is so cool.

04:58.600 --> 05:02.520
Basically, they just couldn't maintain the brilliant momentum that they once had.

05:02.520 --> 05:05.640
However, on the horizon, something much more sinister was brewing.

05:05.640 --> 05:09.800
A tragedy about to befall both characters involved in this compelling tale.

05:09.800 --> 05:14.600
They were going to face down a challenge much worse than a dead channel, death itself.

05:18.920 --> 05:20.040
This is the end.

05:20.040 --> 05:24.440
They were in the fight for their life, and their fanbase was right behind them.

05:24.440 --> 05:27.960
They needed that support more desperately than anything they needed before.

05:27.960 --> 05:32.360
The tale was of two brothers who were facing down their own life-threatening illnesses.

05:32.360 --> 05:36.680
Jonathan suffering from a kidney problem, and Thomas suffering from severe vertigo.

05:36.680 --> 05:39.800
However, very soon, a few voices of skepticism arose,

05:39.800 --> 05:42.680
that stated that not everything was as it seems.

05:43.800 --> 05:47.320
Now, as far as making shitty clickbaity content goes, I could care less.

05:47.320 --> 05:50.680
I mean, there's millions of people that do this on the internet, and I say get that money.

05:50.680 --> 05:51.640
More power to you.

05:53.240 --> 05:56.600
But the second you start pretending you're dying in order to get clicks and views

05:56.600 --> 05:59.800
after your channel's kind of suffering and not performing as well as it used to,

05:59.800 --> 06:03.080
well, that's when I start to just raise a little eyebrow at it.

06:03.880 --> 06:07.080
Join me today as I look into the story of Extreme Games,

06:07.080 --> 06:11.080
and what led them to one of the most bizarre creator meltdowns in the last year,

06:11.080 --> 06:13.960
and see if we can diagnose the real problem.

06:13.960 --> 06:15.000
Are you ready?

06:15.000 --> 06:15.560
Good.

06:15.560 --> 06:16.600
I know I am.

06:16.600 --> 06:18.120
Let us commence.

06:29.800 --> 06:34.760
4.2 Million Subscribers

06:34.760 --> 06:40.120
A channel that has 4.2 million subscribers, they couldn't have obtained that overnight.

06:40.120 --> 06:41.080
Well, they didn't.

06:41.080 --> 06:44.520
In spite of the fact that most of their content wasn't online anymore,

06:44.520 --> 06:48.920
I have been able to create a somewhat accurate timeline of the progress of their channel,

06:48.920 --> 06:51.080
and what it says about them as creators.

06:51.080 --> 06:55.160
It's quite incredible, actually, the lack of public record of their content,

06:55.160 --> 06:57.880
despite the monumental statistics.

06:57.880 --> 07:01.000
The actual documented content is rather scarce.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.600
One of the things that I found was that no one seemed to screenshot their content,

07:04.600 --> 07:07.480
and that made it very hard to find archived versions.

07:07.480 --> 07:11.480
In fact, this video would not exist if it hadn't been for Leon Lush's archivings

07:11.480 --> 07:16.360
of their videos about their illnesses, so I wanted to extend my sincerest gratitude to him.

07:16.360 --> 07:19.160
However, fortunately, because I am a tenacious bastard,

07:19.160 --> 07:22.920
the one thing that Extreme Games did not do was clear their Twitter history,

07:22.920 --> 07:25.480
and this is where it becomes quite spicy.

07:25.480 --> 07:26.440
Now, what do we know?

07:26.440 --> 07:31.480
We know that Extreme Games were formed in around 2014, mid 2014.

07:31.480 --> 07:34.040
Now, we don't know exactly what they were doing back then,

07:34.040 --> 07:36.920
however, unfortunately, their Twitter is pretty much untouched,

07:36.920 --> 07:39.320
so we know the sort of content that they were tweeting.

07:39.320 --> 07:43.880
Now, I want to have a quick trivia game, because you all know how much I love quizzes.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.400
Today's million pound question is,

07:45.400 --> 07:49.800
what sort of channel did Extreme Games brand themselves as in 2015?

07:49.800 --> 07:55.000
Your options are a Clash of Clans gaming channel, or a free giveaway channel.

07:55.960 --> 07:59.720
If you answered A or B, you'd only be half right, because it was both.

07:59.720 --> 08:02.680
In fact, they'd really love to tell you that they were doing free giveaways

08:02.680 --> 08:04.680
for Clash of Clans accounts.

08:04.680 --> 08:08.040
I really do feel bad for anyone who was tagged in their insipid tweets,

08:08.040 --> 08:10.360
telling them to make sure they like and subscribe,

08:10.360 --> 08:13.800
so they're in with a chance to win an epic Clash of Clans account.

08:13.800 --> 08:17.560
However, maybe they did have a legitimate passion for this Clash of Clans content,

08:17.560 --> 08:19.800
because in rare footage of them with Banks plays,

08:19.800 --> 08:23.240
they informed the audience that they were actually top ten at one point.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.080
And so these guys right here are pretty much badasses at Clash Royale,

08:29.080 --> 08:31.000
are they what y'all are number ten in the world at some point?

08:31.000 --> 08:34.920
Yes, yes, we were at some point, but we're still pretty high up there at the moment.

08:34.920 --> 08:38.680
Now, honestly, she seems more convinced than they do about this fun fact,

08:38.680 --> 08:42.200
but I don't know, it looks like they did reach the top 50 at a stage,

08:42.200 --> 08:44.520
so hey, it's not impossible.

08:44.520 --> 08:48.440
After all, why wouldn't I trust these Extreme Gamers?

08:48.440 --> 08:49.480
Looking at their other tweets,

08:49.480 --> 08:52.840
they also said hello to some people with a couple of replies,

08:52.840 --> 08:55.080
very productive conversation.

08:55.080 --> 08:59.720
Honestly, I can't imagine what living this life would be like just tweeting at people,

08:59.720 --> 09:05.480
but hey, they were young, probably around 16 and 17, 18,

09:05.480 --> 09:08.280
and they were at that stage where they could learn and grow.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.280
So how did they evolve in the coming years?

09:11.320 --> 09:15.480
Well, it seems after hitting a few subscriber milestones, they spanned out.

09:15.480 --> 09:20.200
They did some different games with giveaways, they did some prank calls with giveaways.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.440
Honestly, they seemed to enjoy their giveaways.

09:22.440 --> 09:24.440
Even when they were making different content,

09:24.440 --> 09:27.080
they were still integrated with the giveaways.

09:27.080 --> 09:30.840
They also had what must have been the shortest Shoutout Sunday series,

09:30.840 --> 09:36.600
running from the 23rd of February 2016 to the 23rd of February 2016.

09:36.600 --> 09:39.000
I hope that someone got their shoutout.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
Ultimately, their mentality represented a time where people were just so obsessed

09:43.000 --> 09:46.280
with subscriber counts, and the short-term gain that could be obtained

09:46.280 --> 09:48.280
by having a nice number next to your name,

09:48.280 --> 09:50.760
that was more valued than actually constructing a channel

09:50.760 --> 09:52.360
for which people would stick around for.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.520
Most of these giveaways were presented with the commitment

09:54.520 --> 09:56.920
that you needed to like and subscribe to the channel.

09:56.920 --> 10:00.360
Now, beyond the fact that a person could not see who has liked their videos

10:00.360 --> 10:03.240
unless they went on their channel and looked at their playlists,

10:03.240 --> 10:06.040
and they would have to have a public playlist of liked videos,

10:06.040 --> 10:08.360
it's also the same pretty much with subscriptions.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.520
They would have to have their subscriptions public.

10:10.520 --> 10:14.280
They could, in all fairness, look at who subscribed to them in their subscriber list.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.080
However, that's only people who make their subscriptions public.

10:17.080 --> 10:20.760
At this stage, a fair majority of giveaways were absolute codswallop,

10:20.760 --> 10:23.880
and although I cannot comment on the legitimacy of the specific ones,

10:23.880 --> 10:25.320
I highly doubt they were real.

10:25.320 --> 10:28.360
Given that I highly doubt they were making much money when they started,

10:28.360 --> 10:32.120
the volume of these giveaways was such that unless they were already oil barons,

10:32.120 --> 10:33.880
I highly doubt they have the budget.

10:33.880 --> 10:37.480
With that said, at the start there were a fair few people who did claim to win,

10:37.480 --> 10:41.000
and they did seem to announce winners as well, even in later videos,

10:41.000 --> 10:44.680
although once again my point about their flawed methodology still persists,

10:44.680 --> 10:47.640
and just because there were some winners or some announced winners

10:47.640 --> 10:50.520
doesn't mean that every single giveaway was legitimate.

10:50.520 --> 10:52.680
There may be people who have claimed to give away things to winners,

10:52.680 --> 10:54.200
but that would not be the case.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.680
They also did some streaming on camcorder this time,

10:56.680 --> 11:00.600
but that site's defunct, so that's another one lost to the vaults unfortunately.

11:00.600 --> 11:04.840
Now with that said, given the topic, and given their competence with the topic,

11:04.840 --> 11:09.080
they did acquire a sturdy fanbase, however it clearly wasn't good enough for them.

11:09.080 --> 11:12.200
The pool audience for Clash of Clans is pretty restricted.

11:12.200 --> 11:16.360
There are some popular channels, but you're not gonna have a plethora of them,

11:16.360 --> 11:18.600
and with gamers as extreme as Tom and John,

11:18.600 --> 11:23.160
they knew they could easily adapt with the changing environment, so they did.

11:23.160 --> 11:27.000
But what was the big thing at the time around 2016?

11:27.000 --> 11:30.040
Well it was Pokemon Go, so what did they do?

11:30.040 --> 11:34.200
They rebranded to Extreme Games Pokemon Go,

11:34.200 --> 11:35.960
that was literally the name of their channel,

11:35.960 --> 11:39.000
and quickly began to churn out content catered to that audience,

11:39.000 --> 11:42.440
of which back in 2016, there was a lot of desire for.

11:42.440 --> 11:45.800
There was hesitant success when they started this content in July,

11:45.800 --> 11:50.120
but by August, they were attaining subscribers at a rate not seen before.

11:50.120 --> 11:54.200
What I assume made their content particularly successful alongside the topic choice,

11:54.200 --> 11:55.880
was the giveaways.

11:56.600 --> 11:57.800
And it's gonna be amazing.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.080
Before we get into this video guys,

11:59.080 --> 12:02.280
we wanna quickly run you through our huge giveaways that we're doing guys.

12:02.280 --> 12:06.840
The first step to enter our Pokemon Go level 30 account giveaways is guys,

12:06.840 --> 12:08.600
you gotta like this video.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.760
We're trying to hit 10,000 likes on this video,

12:10.760 --> 12:13.320
so every single person watching this video,

12:13.320 --> 12:15.400
go down below and smash that like button,

12:15.400 --> 12:18.440
it is one of the biggest steps to enter into this giveaway.

12:18.440 --> 12:22.840
Giveaways back then were basically pasted at the start of videos by these creators.

12:22.840 --> 12:27.160
What this would do is catch audiences who may not otherwise watch the whole video,

12:27.160 --> 12:28.840
and persuade them to subscribe,

12:28.840 --> 12:30.920
so that in the future when you upload it,

12:30.920 --> 12:34.120
there would be a higher probability of them viewing your content.

12:34.120 --> 12:37.640
At first, I didn't think this observation was particularly consequential,

12:37.640 --> 12:41.000
however, I do want you to keep this in mind for their future content.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.760
Combined with already high viewership,

12:42.760 --> 12:45.400
this turned over a high subscriber rate for the lads,

12:45.400 --> 12:49.880
and by the end of 2016, they hit 200,000 subscribers.

12:49.880 --> 12:53.400
At first, it seemed bizarre to me that people would inundate their audience

12:53.400 --> 12:54.840
with that level of giveaways,

12:54.840 --> 12:56.040
they're obviously not real,

12:56.040 --> 13:00.040
and all you're doing is creating a load of dormant subscribers who will desert you.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.480
But then it hit me,

13:01.480 --> 13:02.680
and it hit me hard.

13:08.440 --> 13:11.480
Extreme Games ran a very interesting project on the surface,

13:11.480 --> 13:13.880
because they weren't just empty shells of people,

13:13.880 --> 13:17.240
they clearly have souls, and activities that they enjoy.

13:17.240 --> 13:20.200
However, they were also rather unexceptional in their personality,

13:20.200 --> 13:22.280
if someone was asked what made their content,

13:22.280 --> 13:24.520
they would probably hesitate to provide an answer.

13:24.520 --> 13:28.120
Because at first, the giveaways seemed to just be a vacuous inclusion

13:28.120 --> 13:29.560
to increase subscriber count,

13:29.560 --> 13:30.360
which they are,

13:30.360 --> 13:32.840
let me emphasise that, of course, cannot be ignored.

13:32.840 --> 13:34.200
However, after some brooding,

13:34.200 --> 13:37.000
I came to the conclusion that it was actually the giveaways

13:37.000 --> 13:39.560
that also gave them such a staying power.

13:39.560 --> 13:42.120
Creators like Derv were only known for their giveaways,

13:42.120 --> 13:45.880
because otherwise, their content provided nothing really of additional value.

13:45.880 --> 13:50.280
With Extreme Games, their videos were mediocre, even tolerable at points.

13:50.280 --> 13:53.880
This ultimately meant that if people had an additional reason to watch their content,

13:53.880 --> 13:57.480
they normally would if it covered something that might have appealed to their interest.

13:57.480 --> 14:00.760
At the same time, they could enter whatever definitely legitimate giveaway

14:00.760 --> 14:02.040
the YouTuber was hosting,

14:02.040 --> 14:04.280
and provide them with the view that they desired.

14:04.280 --> 14:05.880
On top of this, the fact that Extreme Games

14:05.880 --> 14:09.240
always said they would announce the winner in future videos

14:09.240 --> 14:12.120
gave people a greater desire to watch those future videos

14:12.120 --> 14:14.120
to see if they could find out if they had won.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.440
So when they were making these Pokemon videos that were,

14:16.440 --> 14:19.320
from my perspective, equatable to FIFA opening packs,

14:19.320 --> 14:21.800
people would just find mild amusement from the content,

14:21.800 --> 14:23.480
and then continue with their day.

14:23.480 --> 14:27.080
This also allowed the brothers to change genre of content fairly easily,

14:27.080 --> 14:28.520
because although clearly existent,

14:28.520 --> 14:31.240
there wasn't an intense topic loyalty to what they covered.

14:31.240 --> 14:34.520
This meant that although they had created over 200,000 subscribers

14:34.520 --> 14:36.200
from Pokemon related content,

14:36.200 --> 14:40.440
a number that many Pokemon creators would never consider changing their content for,

14:40.440 --> 14:43.400
in the extreme world, it was rather elementary.

14:43.400 --> 14:46.680
They continued their Pokemon content well into 2017,

14:46.680 --> 14:50.520
however at around February time, they started to seemingly mix it up a little.

14:50.520 --> 14:54.040
One of the first videos that appears to have been a real benchmark for this change

14:54.040 --> 14:59.400
was another private video called $1 Cake vs $870 Cake.

14:59.400 --> 15:02.760
At this point, they appeared to begin integrating some new types of videos,

15:02.760 --> 15:05.400
ones that didn't focus around just Pokemon.

15:05.400 --> 15:10.040
That's beginning the segue to eventually completely phase out Pokemon content altogether.

15:10.040 --> 15:14.440
The other video that I really want to note is one called How I Almost Died.

15:14.440 --> 15:15.480
Let's have a quick watch.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.200
I take these every single day.

15:18.200 --> 15:21.640
Now if you want to know why, make sure you watch this video all the way through,

15:21.640 --> 15:25.080
and I will tell you why all these tablets need to be taken daily.

15:25.080 --> 15:27.640
Before we get into this video guys, I want to quickly tell you guys,

15:27.640 --> 15:32.040
we are holding some humongous giveaways, iTunes cards, Google Play cards,

15:32.040 --> 15:33.080
and much more.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.680
Oh, another giveaway.

15:34.680 --> 15:38.520
So basically, in this video, they describe Jonathan's dice with death,

15:38.520 --> 15:41.720
and how it affected them, over suitably emotional music.

15:41.720 --> 15:45.720
So the kidney disease specialists actually checked my urine,

15:45.720 --> 15:49.320
and checked that there was actually a lot of protein in my urine,

15:49.320 --> 15:52.600
and actually a lot of blood in my urine, which are two bad things.

15:52.600 --> 15:56.200
You don't want to have either of those in your urine, obviously.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.800
But yeah, to those two bad things.

15:57.800 --> 15:58.920
So they gave me three options.

15:58.920 --> 16:02.440
They said option number one is you can get on Predicinal,

16:02.440 --> 16:07.240
which is a tablet that like, really, I'll tell you guys a bit later,

16:07.240 --> 16:08.520
really is bad for you.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.680
Then there is another option where we could do nothing.

16:11.800 --> 16:12.840
That's one of the options.

16:12.840 --> 16:16.840
And then the third option was get a kidney biopsy to see exactly what I have.

16:17.480 --> 16:21.000
It appears that Jonathan had a kidney condition that caused various symptoms,

16:21.000 --> 16:22.680
and led him to be hospitalized.

16:22.680 --> 16:26.040
I can't necessarily completely comment on the validity of the story.

16:26.040 --> 16:28.760
What I can comment on is that it gave them two things.

16:29.720 --> 16:32.280
A lot of views, and a lot of very sympathetic comments from individuals

16:32.280 --> 16:33.960
who identified with that struggle.

16:33.960 --> 16:38.440
A struggle that doesn't come easily, and a struggle often harder to open up about.

16:38.440 --> 16:41.080
Although the piano was a rather heavy-handed measure,

16:41.080 --> 16:44.600
many were prepared to look past it and see the humanity in the message,

16:44.600 --> 16:46.280
and to witness that struggle.

16:46.280 --> 16:48.760
Now as said, I'm not one to doubt this story.

16:48.760 --> 16:51.240
The medicine that he's taking all checks out,

16:51.240 --> 16:53.960
and he seems to have reasonable knowledge of the condition,

16:53.960 --> 16:57.560
though it does enter suspicious territory at certain points.

16:58.440 --> 17:00.200
He's not going to tell you the actual story.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.480
I'll tell you the actual story.

17:02.920 --> 17:05.480
That's not the crazy part, because normally people would be like,

17:05.480 --> 17:08.040
okay, you can't see it, so you can't feel it, right?

17:08.040 --> 17:10.440
They put in a drug, they numb your back.

17:11.080 --> 17:12.680
This is the crazy part.

17:12.680 --> 17:16.120
Johnny here didn't get any numbing anything.

17:16.120 --> 17:20.040
So pretty much, he felt getting stabbed in the back multiple times.

17:21.240 --> 17:24.440
He didn't get any of the numbing drugs to get to numb his back.

17:24.440 --> 17:25.480
He wasn't asleep.

17:25.480 --> 17:26.520
He wasn't anything.

17:26.520 --> 17:27.960
He was just under there.

17:27.960 --> 17:29.560
And the doctor, when he came out, he said,

17:30.200 --> 17:32.120
this kid is the strongest kid I've ever seen.

17:32.120 --> 17:39.240
He said, I've seen fully grown adults do this with being numbed and still cry.

17:39.240 --> 17:42.600
And he did it without being numbed, and he was only, what, 15 at the time.

17:42.600 --> 17:45.560
I'd personally be quite surprised if doctors were allowed to operate

17:45.560 --> 17:48.280
on someone without any anaesthetic administered,

17:48.280 --> 17:49.960
and I'm still not sure why.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.320
But hey, I digress.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.040
Maybe he is just an extremely strong lad.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.600
There are some other interesting points, such as the information

17:56.600 --> 18:00.040
that membranous nephropathy is typically found in older adults,

18:00.040 --> 18:03.160
and theory that maybe he took this story from a relative I'm sure

18:03.160 --> 18:07.240
has bounced around in people's minds, but that was too cynical for me.

18:07.240 --> 18:10.280
As said, there are sides to this story that seem to add up.

18:10.280 --> 18:13.560
So yes, this video received a lot of positive feedback and support

18:13.560 --> 18:15.080
from many people within the community,

18:15.080 --> 18:17.400
and it was also a video that came out just before

18:17.400 --> 18:19.960
a very successful run of uploads for the brothers.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.560
How consistently successful?

18:21.560 --> 18:25.960
Well, I can't say, because for I know they've unlisted all the poorly performing ones.

18:25.960 --> 18:29.080
However, the ones that did do well, did very well.

18:29.080 --> 18:31.480
We're not just talking about 1 or 2 million views a video,

18:31.480 --> 18:33.720
we're talking 10 million plus videos.

18:33.720 --> 18:38.040
These videos were an eventual transition out of the Pokemon related content,

18:38.040 --> 18:40.520
and represented a move to content more general.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.520
Many channels couldn't make this transition,

18:42.520 --> 18:44.600
but there were two factors that eased this.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.360
The first one we spoke about earlier.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.760
The other factor that was important to note was that

18:48.760 --> 18:53.160
this new type of content didn't necessarily alienate those who subscribed for Pokemon.

18:53.160 --> 18:56.200
Many people have been easily pulled in by these types of videos,

18:56.200 --> 18:57.480
they have a general appeal,

18:57.480 --> 19:01.640
they weren't necessarily moving from Pokemon to another specific game,

19:01.640 --> 19:05.800
they were moving to a more broad genre that could still catch a viewer's attention,

19:05.800 --> 19:07.640
regardless of that viewer's interests.

19:07.640 --> 19:10.440
In the moment, doing this made them incredibly successful,

19:10.440 --> 19:13.160
but they also took a critical hit to their staying power.

19:13.160 --> 19:15.240
Back when they made videos on specific games,

19:15.240 --> 19:17.160
they had the reassurance that their content

19:17.160 --> 19:20.120
was likely always going to appeal to a certain audience.

19:20.120 --> 19:22.280
This venture was like searching for treasure,

19:22.280 --> 19:24.600
it was either incredible amounts of success,

19:24.600 --> 19:25.960
or no success at all,

19:25.960 --> 19:28.200
but when you keep looting the same island,

19:28.200 --> 19:30.040
the returns become diminished,

19:30.040 --> 19:32.040
and if you have no other islands to loot,

19:32.040 --> 19:35.880
then the voyages become repeatedly less and less fortuitous,

19:35.880 --> 19:39.720
and suddenly, all those previous voyages just don't seem so successful.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.000
How could that happen?

19:41.000 --> 19:41.960
Let's have a chat.

19:47.560 --> 19:51.320
Many of us have an understanding of what might make an audience view our content,

19:51.320 --> 19:54.040
typically the main aim is to keep people coming back.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.600
A subscription is an important component of that,

19:56.600 --> 19:59.880
because it shows a commitment that will subsequently have a knock-on effect

19:59.880 --> 20:03.240
on the frequency that the individual sees our content in their feed,

20:03.240 --> 20:05.240
however it's still only half the story.

20:05.240 --> 20:08.120
I feel the lads over at Extreme Games did understand that,

20:08.120 --> 20:11.320
and tried to use the anticipation yielded by multiple giveaways

20:11.320 --> 20:14.040
to have people stick around longer than they normally would.

20:14.040 --> 20:16.600
However, it was a fickle sense of brand loyalty,

20:16.600 --> 20:19.400
mainly because people become impatient when they don't win,

20:19.400 --> 20:22.440
and even if they were legitimately picking winners of these giveaways,

20:22.440 --> 20:26.680
the chances of winning became much lower the larger their channel became.

20:26.680 --> 20:30.760
By gaining subscribers from this method, they undermined their own appeal.

20:30.760 --> 20:33.640
The idea of giveaways are a nice inclusion here and there,

20:33.640 --> 20:36.840
but unless everyone legitimately believes they have a chance of winning,

20:36.840 --> 20:41.960
the subscribers and views that it provides is never substantial enough to justify the technique,

20:41.960 --> 20:44.440
mainly because many creators also understand

20:44.440 --> 20:47.880
that you need to have people invested in your content for the long term,

20:47.880 --> 20:52.360
they need to be invested in a part of you, the creator, which can be relied on.

20:52.360 --> 20:57.640
Giveaways can't be relied on by the viewer, because they are almost completely chance-based.

20:57.640 --> 21:01.000
At the time for Tom and John, it may have been hard for them to notice this,

21:01.000 --> 21:03.720
behind the absolutely monumental views,

21:03.720 --> 21:06.200
but they were setting up a channel that would not survive,

21:06.200 --> 21:09.320
their move to broad topics made them vulnerable to a changing of the tide

21:09.320 --> 21:11.080
with no real hook on the content,

21:11.080 --> 21:14.680
and their giveaways were undermined by the colossal size of the viewership

21:14.680 --> 21:16.680
and the alienation that came with that.

21:16.680 --> 21:18.760
Eventually the views began to dwindle.

21:18.760 --> 21:23.400
Once again, I can't exactly calculate the point where they drop below a reasonable threshold,

21:23.400 --> 21:26.360
because they've removed a majority of the unsuccessful videos,

21:26.360 --> 21:30.600
but you can see a clear trend in the ones that the brothers deem worthy to remain.

21:30.600 --> 21:32.600
With the gradual decline of their views,

21:32.600 --> 21:36.120
it appeared that there was no real way to switch up at this point,

21:36.120 --> 21:39.560
as mentioned, to survive the evolving environment of these types of videos,

21:39.560 --> 21:42.680
you either have to be accompanied with an abnormally high output rate,

21:42.680 --> 21:45.880
or have something genuinely unique about your personality,

21:45.880 --> 21:47.880
or the way that you conduct your content,

21:47.880 --> 21:50.520
and that's something Extreme Games just did not have.

21:50.520 --> 21:53.880
However, they did have one more character to introduce to this story,

21:53.880 --> 21:55.320
and that was Jesus.

21:56.680 --> 21:59.880
Now, the brothers had always been fond of their festivities,

21:59.880 --> 22:03.160
however, on October 29th 2017,

22:03.160 --> 22:04.360
the lads tweeted out that,

22:04.360 --> 22:11.560
Now, as you probably know, I am not a man of faith,

22:11.560 --> 22:15.720
however, I take no issue with anyone who finds solace within the bounds of religion.

22:15.720 --> 22:19.960
Nonetheless, it did seem like a sudden wave of found faith that caught me off guard.

22:19.960 --> 22:21.960
After this initial tweet, to be fair to them,

22:21.960 --> 22:24.840
they did follow through with this commitment to Jesus Christ,

22:24.840 --> 22:27.160
as shown by their Twitter and Instagram.

22:27.160 --> 22:29.000
Guys, it's time for the bible verse of the day.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.360
Johnny, what is it?

22:30.360 --> 22:32.760
It is, in your relationships with one another,

22:32.760 --> 22:35.560
have the same mindset as Jesus Christ.

22:35.560 --> 22:37.320
That is the verse meaning pretty much,

22:37.320 --> 22:39.320
what Jesus Christ does is he loves everyone,

22:39.320 --> 22:42.200
and he cares for everyone, he wants the best for everyone.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.400
So that's what he's saying,

22:43.400 --> 22:46.040
in your mindset with one another, with your friends, with your family,

22:46.040 --> 22:48.120
with anyone, just a random person on the street,

22:48.120 --> 22:50.280
have that same mindset, have that same love,

22:50.280 --> 22:53.000
have that same passion for everyone you meet,

22:53.000 --> 22:54.920
and everything will be really awesome,

22:54.920 --> 22:56.600
you'll always have a good feeling in your heart.

22:57.160 --> 22:59.560
So that was Philippines chapter 2 verse 5,

22:59.560 --> 23:00.760
we love you all so much,

23:00.760 --> 23:03.720
and honestly guys, you guys have been giving us some really good comments,

23:03.720 --> 23:05.080
and some great feedback,

23:05.080 --> 23:06.600
we love you guys so much,

23:06.600 --> 23:08.360
have an awesome day, have an awesome night,

23:08.360 --> 23:10.120
and we'll speak to you guys again tomorrow.

23:10.120 --> 23:10.440
Peace!

23:11.240 --> 23:12.600
That's all well and good,

23:12.600 --> 23:16.040
but I think it's pronounced Philippians rather than Philippines,

23:16.040 --> 23:19.240
there's a difference between the sovereign state and the New Testament book.

23:19.240 --> 23:20.840
Anyhow, pronunciation aside,

23:20.840 --> 23:24.040
their commitment to Jesus Christ without necessary explanation

23:24.040 --> 23:25.560
certainly came as a surprise,

23:25.560 --> 23:28.440
but hey, maybe they were always passionate about Christ,

23:28.440 --> 23:31.960
and just felt they could be more open about it with their audience.

23:31.960 --> 23:33.960
After all, who am I to take it away from them?

23:33.960 --> 23:36.280
However, there was one thing bouncing around in my head

23:36.280 --> 23:38.360
that just left me with a lingering suspicion.

23:38.360 --> 23:41.160
Although many find positive meaning in Christianity,

23:41.160 --> 23:44.440
there is a darker side to the idea of organised religion.

23:44.440 --> 23:47.720
Because its validity relies on one's own perception of belief,

23:47.720 --> 23:50.920
there are a lot of individuals who will use this element of Christianity,

23:50.920 --> 23:52.680
and the connection that they have with it,

23:52.680 --> 23:54.680
as an element of binding loyalty.

23:54.680 --> 23:56.840
This has been most often observed with maybe

23:56.840 --> 23:59.080
some of the more celebrity American preachers,

23:59.080 --> 24:01.720
some of whom have been exposed for preaching modesty

24:01.720 --> 24:04.760
while indulging in fairly lavish behaviours themselves.

24:04.760 --> 24:08.280
What happens is that basically people promote themselves as so holy

24:08.280 --> 24:10.680
that people must think that they can do no wrong,

24:10.680 --> 24:13.720
and then when they commit wrong, and some people may call them out,

24:13.720 --> 24:18.440
they use the notion of Christianity to frame themselves as being unfairly persecuted.

24:18.440 --> 24:21.960
Now I highly doubt the lads were necessarily looking at it from that perspective,

24:21.960 --> 24:23.000
but one of these genres,

24:23.080 --> 24:27.080
there does seem to be a real lack of strongly Christian individuals, is YouTube.

24:27.080 --> 24:29.560
I'm not referring to softly spiritual individuals,

24:29.560 --> 24:32.440
or even people who may identify with the Christian religion,

24:32.440 --> 24:35.720
but those who preach it with the sort of fervour that these lads do.

24:35.720 --> 24:38.920
Some people in this genre even receive a decent amount of stigma,

24:38.920 --> 24:41.640
and some of that, I'd argue, is hard to justify.

24:41.640 --> 24:43.720
I don't know why the lads made this sudden change,

24:43.720 --> 24:45.640
but honestly, it felt out of place.

24:45.640 --> 24:48.040
Not because I don't think you can be Christian on concept,

24:48.040 --> 24:51.320
but because I didn't feel it fit into the way that they behaved.

24:51.320 --> 24:52.920
And you know, maybe that's just me,

24:52.920 --> 24:56.680
but I guess I don't see the preaching of deep Christian principles

24:56.680 --> 25:00.040
as completely congruent with the content that they viewed as marketable,

25:00.040 --> 25:02.920
and maybe that's my more judgmental side coming into play.

25:02.920 --> 25:06.440
I know there's nothing specifically in the Bible about clickbaits.

25:06.440 --> 25:07.960
Ultimately, when going through the stage,

25:07.960 --> 25:09.720
although I have my own personal feelings,

25:09.720 --> 25:12.600
if Christianity is something that they want to promote to their audience,

25:12.600 --> 25:13.880
then that is fair enough.

25:13.880 --> 25:18.360
They did start promoting Christianity as a concept before their overwhelming success,

25:18.360 --> 25:20.840
even if it was just with the occasional tweets.

25:20.840 --> 25:26.120
The actual Instagram videos that I showed you there were from around February in 2018,

25:26.120 --> 25:30.360
which was just under a month after they had their last multi-million view video,

25:30.360 --> 25:32.200
the 24 hour escape room.

25:32.520 --> 25:33.080
No way!

25:33.880 --> 25:35.400
Don't do that!

25:35.400 --> 25:36.360
And you know what?

25:36.360 --> 25:38.440
This tape is impenetrable.

25:38.440 --> 25:38.840
What?

25:38.840 --> 25:39.960
You don't believe that?

25:39.960 --> 25:40.600
You know what that means?

25:40.600 --> 25:41.000
What?

25:41.000 --> 25:42.360
You can't break it.

25:42.360 --> 25:43.560
I don't believe that.

25:43.560 --> 25:44.360
Well, believe it.

25:45.400 --> 25:46.760
I don't believe that.

25:46.760 --> 25:48.520
I'm gonna break out, you know that, right?

25:48.520 --> 25:49.240
Believe it.

25:49.240 --> 25:49.800
I'm hungry!

25:50.360 --> 25:51.800
It's lunch time and I haven't eaten!

25:52.440 --> 25:53.320
Are you gonna get me some food?

25:53.320 --> 25:55.160
You should have thought of that before you tried to run the joint.

25:55.160 --> 25:56.360
Let me see if this stuff's real.

25:57.720 --> 25:58.440
Rip fruit.

25:59.240 --> 26:03.080
I'd asked how these videos received so many likes,

26:03.080 --> 26:07.000
but then I realised that there was another giveaway at the start, so who cares?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.240
However, there was a lingering suspicion that to me,

26:09.240 --> 26:12.440
there was a deeper meaning to their Christianity,

26:12.440 --> 26:14.600
and that was about to be exercised.

26:28.440 --> 26:38.440
The thing is, whether the lads were genuinely Christian or not,

26:38.440 --> 26:39.560
and they may well be,

26:39.560 --> 26:44.120
there is a unique appeal to be a YouTuber who openly preaches their belief in God.

26:44.120 --> 26:47.000
Once again, it promotes a level of loyalty.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.680
In a way to me, it seemed like a reformulated approach of the giveaways,

26:50.680 --> 26:52.920
it was a way to increase people's commitment to you

26:52.920 --> 26:56.520
without offering anything additional value in the actual content,

26:56.520 --> 27:00.040
because honestly, this is not really what I consider high quality.

27:07.640 --> 27:11.400
Now with that said, there are many risks to promoting a specific religious doctrine.

27:11.400 --> 27:14.200
You may alienate significant portions of your audience,

27:14.200 --> 27:17.720
those who may identify with other religions or no religion at all.

27:17.720 --> 27:20.360
However, it's important to note that the preaching that we observe

27:20.360 --> 27:23.320
was pretty much confined to their Instagram and Twitter,

27:23.320 --> 27:26.440
which is where you'd find their more committed audience anyway.

27:26.440 --> 27:28.280
I feel this was a tactical decision,

27:28.280 --> 27:32.520
as they were aware of the risk that inserting that into every video would ensue.

27:32.520 --> 27:35.400
To me, it seemed like a way to try and gain a commitment from fans

27:35.400 --> 27:39.160
who sought out their personas more passionately than the surface level audience.

27:40.280 --> 27:42.200
I don't know if the brothers understand this,

27:42.200 --> 27:46.520
but a key part of videos performing well is click-through rate, also known as CTR.

27:46.520 --> 27:49.480
Now the problem is that if you have a large, dead channel,

27:49.480 --> 27:52.280
the audiences may be advertised a video when you upload it,

27:52.280 --> 27:53.640
but when none of them click it,

27:53.720 --> 27:57.080
YouTube will probably decide that it's not worth promoting much further.

27:57.080 --> 27:59.720
By creating a committed audience on social media,

27:59.720 --> 28:02.360
they could increase CTR of the video at the start,

28:02.360 --> 28:07.160
and boost it to additional audiences who may be drawn in by their regular giveaway formula.

28:07.160 --> 28:09.640
However, one thing that they really didn't take into account

28:09.640 --> 28:13.640
was the fact that the proportion of committed fans was astronomically low.

28:13.640 --> 28:19.160
For a 4 million subscriber channel to have 13k followers on Twitter is embarrassing,

28:19.160 --> 28:21.800
especially given the volume that they posted on there.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.440
I think they were always trying to add a depth and commitment

28:24.440 --> 28:26.520
that they themselves couldn't bring to the table,

28:26.520 --> 28:30.520
and when people recognised that, they moved on, and that couldn't have felt good.

28:30.520 --> 28:35.000
I don't think it's easy for any creator to realise that their channel isn't what it used to be.

28:35.000 --> 28:39.240
There are very few creators who can maintain the spotlight for an extended length of time,

28:39.240 --> 28:42.280
and even some of the larger stars have fallen rather hard,

28:42.280 --> 28:45.560
and when people do fall, there are many different ways to cope with it.

28:45.560 --> 28:48.840
You could quit YouTube and try and find another career,

28:48.840 --> 28:51.000
you could start a new channel or change brands,

28:51.000 --> 28:53.880
or you could just accept that you'll never be quite where you were,

28:53.880 --> 28:56.680
and just make content for the reduced audience.

28:56.680 --> 28:59.240
Of course, the brothers took none of these options,

28:59.240 --> 29:01.800
but maybe they didn't have the time to consider these options

29:01.800 --> 29:04.120
because before they could come to terms with this,

29:04.120 --> 29:07.560
they had something else, much more horrific to come to terms with.

29:07.560 --> 29:11.480
In a video called We're Quiting YouTube Because We're Dying,

29:11.480 --> 29:13.720
they open up about these struggles.

29:13.720 --> 29:17.400
And it's just hit a point where we literally can't do it anymore.

29:18.360 --> 29:23.640
And it's sad because this is what we love doing,

29:23.640 --> 29:25.400
this is what we love doing so much,

29:26.120 --> 29:29.080
and our bodies literally can't do it anymore.

29:30.200 --> 29:33.560
I know a lot of you guys are probably wondering right now what we're talking about,

29:35.800 --> 29:39.240
but pretty much we're both really sick,

29:39.880 --> 29:43.800
and this could be the last video that we have.

29:43.800 --> 29:45.880
Oh no, what exactly is happening?

29:47.560 --> 29:50.520
I've been fighting this kidney disease now for literally four years,

29:51.320 --> 29:53.320
and it's finally got the best in me.

29:54.040 --> 29:56.120
I can't literally fight it anymore.

29:56.120 --> 29:59.400
I'm holding 16 kilos of fluid in my body,

29:59.400 --> 30:03.560
and when I say fluid, it's literally because my kidneys can't filter my fluid out anymore.

30:04.280 --> 30:08.920
And you know how painful it is to be locked inside your own body?

30:09.560 --> 30:13.400
With all this fluid that you can't physically move, you can't eat, you're not hungry.

30:13.960 --> 30:17.560
No matter what you do, you can't eat, you're not hungry at all.

30:18.600 --> 30:20.280
My body's literally at the end.

30:20.280 --> 30:24.600
It appears that Jonathan's kidney disease has returned in a much more aggressive fashion,

30:24.600 --> 30:27.640
and now he is suffering from excessive amounts of fluid buildup,

30:27.640 --> 30:30.280
which is affecting every aspect of his life.

30:30.280 --> 30:34.120
But it doesn't stop there, as apparently Thomas has also been suffering too.

30:35.080 --> 30:40.440
And every single day I wake up, it's like just absolute vertigo.

30:40.440 --> 30:43.960
And if you guys don't know what vertigo is, it's like dizziness.

30:43.960 --> 30:49.240
You know when you're on a roller coaster, you get off and everything's spinning,

30:49.240 --> 30:50.280
the world is spinning.

30:50.840 --> 30:56.200
Imagine that happening to you every single day for the entire duration of the day,

30:56.840 --> 31:00.920
and it's just like on, off, on, off, on, off,

31:00.920 --> 31:03.880
and you just keep getting dizzy every single day for four years.

31:04.280 --> 31:07.720
That's kind of what's happened, what that is, what's happened to me.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.920
And then you get acne, and then your stomach's always hurting, you vomit,

31:12.920 --> 31:17.240
and it's just like, you kind of can't live.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.760
Of absolute vertigo.

31:20.760 --> 31:21.320
All right.

31:23.240 --> 31:26.600
You feel like you're in a box, and you can't escape.

31:27.240 --> 31:28.600
Your mind goes insane.

31:29.240 --> 31:30.120
You can't breathe.

31:31.080 --> 31:37.000
You just get so tight and worn out, and it's just like,

31:37.960 --> 31:41.240
you kind of wish you could just put yourself to sleep forever, sort of thing.

31:42.200 --> 31:43.880
But obviously there's no way to do that.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.800
This did not appear to be good, and given their medical conditions,

31:47.800 --> 31:52.200
it was very understandable that they would not want to continue pursuing their YouTube careers.

31:52.200 --> 31:56.680
It was obviously just highly unfortunate that this coincided with a decrease in views,

31:56.680 --> 31:58.920
and they were, of course, legitimately dying.

31:58.920 --> 32:03.640
However, like the true province they were, they had one more important announcement to make.

32:03.640 --> 32:07.880
Guys, we want to say a serious thank you to every single person that's watched our videos.

32:07.880 --> 32:10.360
Seriously, all you guys out there, we love you so much.

32:10.920 --> 32:14.280
And we want you to know two things.

32:14.280 --> 32:16.440
First thing is we want to give back to you guys.

32:16.440 --> 32:19.640
Every single one of you, we're going to hold a huge giveaway right now.

32:20.200 --> 32:23.080
We're going to give away two iPhone Xs, two of them.

32:23.080 --> 32:24.440
We're literally going to give away two of them.

32:24.440 --> 32:26.200
That's how much we love you guys.

32:26.200 --> 32:29.400
And all you got to do is literally like this video,

32:29.400 --> 32:32.520
turn on notifications on our channel, and subscribe.

32:33.080 --> 32:33.720
And that's it.

32:33.720 --> 32:35.480
And you're entered into the giveaway.

32:35.480 --> 32:38.360
We're giving one last giveaway just because we seriously want to give back,

32:38.360 --> 32:41.080
because we honestly love you all so much.

32:41.080 --> 32:41.960
That's the first thing.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.920
Second thing is we want you to know Jesus Christ loves you too.

32:45.480 --> 32:45.960
Wow.

32:45.960 --> 32:47.400
Give them a round of applause.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.960
It was a moment of true selflessness.

32:51.960 --> 32:54.200
These individuals, dying of their ailments,

32:54.200 --> 32:58.520
found it in their hearts to once more give back to a community that has supported them.

32:58.520 --> 33:01.480
It's a sort of generosity that just brings you to tears.

33:01.480 --> 33:02.520
You love to see it.

33:02.520 --> 33:05.800
However, if you were watching the video and became slightly suspicious,

33:05.800 --> 33:07.240
then you know what?

33:07.240 --> 33:11.320
You might have justified reason because they go into depth regarding their suffering,

33:11.320 --> 33:14.760
and it just becomes a bit implausible.

33:14.760 --> 33:19.000
Imagine for four years you're feeling sick, dizzy, vomiting,

33:19.640 --> 33:23.640
and your stomach feels like it's practically a volcano.

33:24.200 --> 33:29.480
And you go doctor after doctor, hospital after hospital,

33:30.120 --> 33:32.520
and they all keep telling you there's nothing wrong with you.

33:33.480 --> 33:36.680
Um, that's what's happened to me.

33:38.520 --> 33:41.080
In fact, if they were suffering to the extent that they were,

33:41.080 --> 33:44.120
how come they've had the strength to fly all the way to America?

33:44.120 --> 33:50.280
How did any airline let them do that without them acquiring some special permission?

33:50.280 --> 33:55.240
They then must have recorded and edited and subsequently uploaded this video,

33:55.240 --> 33:58.440
not looking particularly different to any of their other videos.

33:58.440 --> 34:01.480
In fact, if they'd been suffering so badly over the months prior,

34:01.480 --> 34:05.320
what made them so capable to record multiple videos often?

34:05.320 --> 34:08.200
We'd seen very little symptoms demonstrated on screen,

34:08.200 --> 34:11.480
and although a person would obviously avoid showing those symptoms,

34:11.480 --> 34:14.760
the frequency of their upload suggested they would have struggled

34:14.760 --> 34:17.480
if this illness was as severe as they framed it.

34:17.480 --> 34:19.080
But they had one more hope.

34:20.840 --> 34:22.280
We've got this one doctor,

34:24.920 --> 34:26.440
and we've done a lot of like,

34:27.800 --> 34:32.040
we've been researching literally for hours on end

34:32.600 --> 34:35.880
to try and figure out how we're gonna get better.

34:37.480 --> 34:42.120
And we found this one man by the name of Dr. John Bergman,

34:43.080 --> 34:47.960
and he's our last hope.

34:48.600 --> 34:51.240
He's literally our last chance.

34:52.280 --> 34:55.240
He's our last chance at being us again.

34:56.200 --> 34:58.120
He's our last chance at living again.

34:59.160 --> 35:00.680
Well, two more hopes.

35:01.720 --> 35:03.240
With the power of you guys,

35:03.960 --> 35:05.080
with the power of us,

35:05.800 --> 35:06.920
and the power of Jesus,

35:07.560 --> 35:08.680
Jesus Christ,

35:08.680 --> 35:09.240
and God,

35:10.680 --> 35:12.760
we'll be able to do this, I think.

35:12.760 --> 35:13.480
So right now,

35:14.520 --> 35:16.200
all you guys watching this video

35:16.840 --> 35:18.760
will want to ask one thing from you guys,

35:19.320 --> 35:22.520
is that you close your eyes and you make a prayer for us

35:22.520 --> 35:24.440
through the name of Jesus Christ.

35:24.440 --> 35:26.520
Because if you guys do that for us,

35:26.520 --> 35:27.880
I know we'll get better,

35:27.880 --> 35:28.920
and I know we'll heal.

35:29.480 --> 35:29.960
Ah.

35:43.480 --> 35:44.760
With the upload of the video,

35:44.760 --> 35:47.800
there was an outpouring of support and sympathy

35:47.800 --> 35:49.480
from all sorts of audiences,

35:49.480 --> 35:53.400
although once again, the record on the video is quite unclear.

35:53.400 --> 35:54.760
We do know that after upload,

35:54.760 --> 35:56.920
they were receiving a lot of likes and comments

35:56.920 --> 35:58.920
that seemed to be believing in their nature.

35:58.920 --> 36:01.400
This screenshot shows that their like dislike ratio

36:01.400 --> 36:03.960
was around 95% at that point.

36:03.960 --> 36:06.680
It was a video that would generate that sort of support,

36:06.680 --> 36:07.960
particularly from audiences

36:07.960 --> 36:11.320
who may have become acquainted with them in previous videos.

36:11.320 --> 36:14.680
If they're naive enough to be roped in by the giveaways and clickbait,

36:14.680 --> 36:18.520
then someone talking to them about dying is probably just as believable,

36:18.520 --> 36:21.880
particularly considering that many people would be hesitant to call them out,

36:21.880 --> 36:25.080
telling someone who might be going through an excessive amount of suffering

36:25.080 --> 36:26.120
that they're faking it,

36:26.120 --> 36:28.440
or exaggerating it might be sketchy,

36:28.440 --> 36:31.720
and you wouldn't want to agree with someone already suffering like that.

36:31.720 --> 36:34.680
However, not everyone conforms to that formula,

36:34.680 --> 36:37.080
in fact, there's always one person who doesn't,

36:37.800 --> 36:39.000
the commentator.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.720
In this instance, the bold individual who shed the most light onto this was Leon Lush,

36:43.720 --> 36:45.960
although he was rather sensitive to the possibility

36:45.960 --> 36:48.760
that these gentlemen may be suffering from some sort of illness,

36:48.760 --> 36:51.000
he decided to take the side as skepticism,

36:51.000 --> 36:54.040
especially given the very ham-fisted giveaway.

36:54.040 --> 36:56.200
A giveaway in your We're Dying video,

36:56.200 --> 36:58.920
where people have to like and subscribe and turn notifications on

36:58.920 --> 37:01.480
to stay updated and see if they won the giveaway

37:01.480 --> 37:03.240
in your We're Fucking Dying video?

37:06.360 --> 37:08.360
I'll tell you what, it's a good thing I'm a detective,

37:08.360 --> 37:11.160
because it's a red flag right here,

37:11.240 --> 37:13.000
this is a fucking red mother,

37:13.000 --> 37:14.200
this flag is redder,

37:14.200 --> 37:15.880
I just cannot.

37:15.880 --> 37:20.600
It was interesting because I had watched so many extreme games videos at that point,

37:20.600 --> 37:24.760
that although the giveaway would be rightfully viewed as inappropriate by many people,

37:24.760 --> 37:26.120
I was just numb to it,

37:26.120 --> 37:28.600
and I knew that even if they were genuinely dying,

37:28.600 --> 37:31.240
they'd probably still do this thing regardless.

37:31.240 --> 37:34.760
However, for many viewers, particularly the more commentary oriented ones,

37:34.760 --> 37:38.760
this was a tell-all sign these guys weren't being the most honest.

37:38.760 --> 37:42.280
The more obvious point for me was that if these guys were planning to quit YouTube

37:42.280 --> 37:43.320
because they were dying,

37:43.320 --> 37:45.800
then they wouldn't care if people subscribed to their channel.

37:45.800 --> 37:50.600
As noted earlier, subscriptions are not an accurate way to measure entry into these competitions,

37:50.600 --> 37:53.160
as many people don't have their subscriptions public,

37:53.160 --> 37:57.000
and the reason to increase subscriptions is therefore completely self-motivated,

37:57.000 --> 38:00.040
but if they were dying, there would be no motivation to do that.

38:00.040 --> 38:03.640
The confusion was furthered when the lads updated the timeline by making this video,

38:03.640 --> 38:06.440
in which he performed a cover of a photograph by Ed Sheeran,

38:06.440 --> 38:08.600
which I know will be copyright claimed if I play,

38:08.600 --> 38:11.000
so nice bait lads, I'm not falling for it.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.800
Nonetheless, the tone of this video is pretty dramatic.

38:15.080 --> 38:16.680
Guys, the doctor just told us...

38:20.840 --> 38:22.680
that Johnny's got four weeks to live.

38:26.840 --> 38:28.360
He doesn't deserve this.

38:28.360 --> 38:33.000
But I of course understand why you'd be so upset given the dire circumstances.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.680
So yes, he's dying, but suddenly,

38:34.680 --> 38:37.880
they're sat at a lovely Riviera promoting another giveaway,

38:37.880 --> 38:39.960
and this time, the doctor's involved.

38:39.960 --> 38:43.160
We also want you guys to know that the doctor that we're going to right now,

38:43.160 --> 38:44.680
we found him from YouTube,

38:44.680 --> 38:48.520
so we want you guys to check out his YouTube channel and subscribe to him.

38:48.520 --> 38:49.960
If you subscribe to his channel,

38:49.960 --> 38:52.520
you're gonna double your chances at winning this giveaway.

38:52.520 --> 38:54.120
So who is this doctor?

38:54.120 --> 38:57.000
The doctor's name is John Bergman, he is a chiropractor.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Now, I don't want to decry chiropractors,

38:59.000 --> 39:01.640
because I do actually know a fair few people in my life

39:01.640 --> 39:03.400
who have been significantly helped by them.

39:03.400 --> 39:06.840
In fact, I think I might need to take a trip to one eventually myself.

39:06.840 --> 39:10.280
However, I would stress that if you are dying of kidney failure,

39:10.280 --> 39:13.240
a chiropractor probably will not cure you.

39:13.240 --> 39:15.720
The fact also stands for severe vertigo,

39:15.720 --> 39:17.880
and given the severity of their illnesses,

39:17.880 --> 39:22.120
I'm just concerned they were completely unaccompanied in this journey to America.

39:22.120 --> 39:24.760
I mean, it all seems a little far-fetched.

39:24.760 --> 39:26.520
The point is not that they were not ill,

39:26.520 --> 39:28.280
but that they were clearly not dying,

39:28.280 --> 39:29.800
and that in both of their instances,

39:29.880 --> 39:31.560
the video stating that, you know,

39:31.560 --> 39:35.400
one of them may have four weeks left to live seemed ridiculous and manipulative.

39:35.400 --> 39:36.360
Why would they do this?

39:36.360 --> 39:40.440
Well, the first reason is one that I believe is fairly easy to state, views.

39:40.440 --> 39:41.960
As noted at the start of the video,

39:41.960 --> 39:45.000
we tend to follow people's battles with illness quite closely,

39:45.000 --> 39:48.200
and we like to show our support and feel like we're making a difference.

39:48.200 --> 39:51.160
Therefore, these things generate a lot of attention.

39:51.160 --> 39:53.080
Secondly, well subscriber loyalty.

39:53.080 --> 39:56.440
Once again, these creators are trying to create a connection with their audience

39:56.440 --> 39:58.920
on the basis of experiences that they are going through,

39:58.920 --> 40:01.880
rather than anything actually relating to their personality.

40:01.880 --> 40:05.880
The thing is that any regular conduct that is morally justifiable to make videos about

40:05.880 --> 40:07.720
probably has already made videos on them,

40:07.720 --> 40:09.080
and probably better videos,

40:09.080 --> 40:13.240
and therefore these creators need to push the boundaries in a way that most people wouldn't.

40:13.240 --> 40:16.520
In fact, this development ties quite nicely into their previous content,

40:16.520 --> 40:19.960
which was also based around doing what people were not prepared to do.

40:19.960 --> 40:22.440
It's just the reasons that most people weren't prepared to do it

40:22.440 --> 40:24.120
are quite different this time around.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.360
The third reason is because, as mentioned earlier,

40:26.440 --> 40:30.120
people are much more hesitant to call people who may be faking these things out,

40:30.120 --> 40:31.240
in case they were wrong.

40:31.240 --> 40:34.280
This meant that there was a higher chance of them getting away with this.

40:34.280 --> 40:37.080
If people did call them out, well, how dare you?

40:37.080 --> 40:38.920
You could drive them to suicide.

40:38.920 --> 40:41.880
Now I know that a lot of you guys would be saying that you can't die from this,

40:41.880 --> 40:42.520
but you can.

40:42.520 --> 40:44.600
How many people have died from depression?

40:44.600 --> 40:48.040
How many people have died from anxiety and stress?

40:48.040 --> 40:49.880
It just pushes you to a point,

40:49.880 --> 40:52.360
when everyone's telling you that you're not telling the truth,

40:52.360 --> 40:54.440
it pushes you to a point in your mental state,

40:54.440 --> 40:57.160
where you can just suicide, you can do anything.

40:57.160 --> 40:59.720
And honestly, I'm not the kind of person that would suicide,

40:59.720 --> 41:01.720
because I have Jesus Christ in my life,

41:01.720 --> 41:04.440
I would never suicide, no matter what pain I'm ever going through,

41:04.440 --> 41:06.280
suicide is never the option.

41:06.280 --> 41:09.720
But I'm just saying that that is the point where it was getting to,

41:09.720 --> 41:13.960
and my mental state was not stable at all from this sickness.

41:13.960 --> 41:17.320
And the other point that they continued to push was Dr. Bergman.

41:17.320 --> 41:21.080
All you got to do to enter this giveaway is subscribe to Dr. Bergman,

41:21.080 --> 41:24.200
because we want you guys not only to enter a giveaway,

41:24.200 --> 41:25.640
you could win an awesome iPhone,

41:25.640 --> 41:28.200
but you will also learn the truth about health,

41:28.200 --> 41:30.680
because he knows every single answer to the sickness,

41:30.680 --> 41:33.480
he knows a cure to cancer, he knows a cure to liver disease,

41:33.480 --> 41:36.520
he knows a cure to kidney disease, he knows a cure to everything.

41:36.520 --> 41:38.520
You guys are acting like he's just a chiropractor,

41:38.520 --> 41:40.920
but trust me, he is much more than a chiropractor,

41:40.920 --> 41:44.920
he is a genius, he knows everything to do with healing the human body.

41:44.920 --> 41:47.720
So we urge you right now, go subscribe to him,

41:47.720 --> 41:49.720
go click his videos, because he knows the truth.

41:50.840 --> 41:52.520
I'm not entirely sure why they did this,

41:52.600 --> 41:54.680
maybe they had some agreement with the doctor,

41:54.680 --> 41:57.720
but then pushing the narrative that actually Dr. John Bergman

41:57.720 --> 42:01.000
could cure any illness may have appeared funny to us,

42:01.000 --> 42:03.480
but it actually could have been quite sinister.

42:03.480 --> 42:04.600
Let's talk about that more.

42:11.960 --> 42:16.120
I don't know what the alternative timeline was for these creators,

42:16.120 --> 42:19.640
prior to people like Leon Lurch throwing a spanner in the works,

42:19.640 --> 42:21.400
but by the end of the response video,

42:21.400 --> 42:25.240
I came to the conclusion that whatever was going on was some kind of scam.

42:51.400 --> 42:53.560
In this video, we know you guys know the truth,

42:53.560 --> 42:55.240
we know you guys believe in us,

42:55.240 --> 42:59.480
we know you guys know what is actually going on with our bodies and with our lives,

42:59.480 --> 43:02.200
and we're gonna keep filling you guys in as much as possible.

43:02.200 --> 43:06.600
Honestly, Dr. Bergman is starting to show some crazy improvement on our bodies,

43:06.600 --> 43:09.640
we're going to him three times a day, every single day,

43:09.640 --> 43:12.520
working on ourselves, trying to get ourselves fixed and healed,

43:12.520 --> 43:14.200
and a scam is a strong word,

43:14.200 --> 43:17.000
but at the end of the day they were promoting this chiropractor

43:17.000 --> 43:20.120
as the individual who could cure all these illnesses.

43:20.120 --> 43:22.760
When that sort of statement is blatantly false,

43:22.760 --> 43:27.160
and it's easy to point at them and laugh at their complete ignorance in these statements,

43:27.160 --> 43:31.880
but those statements were made when they were under a lot of scrutiny and pressure.

43:31.880 --> 43:33.560
If no one had really challenged them,

43:33.560 --> 43:37.800
and they had exercised their significant influence over a fairly gullible fanbase,

43:37.800 --> 43:40.680
they could have spread some legitimately harmful messages.

43:40.680 --> 43:44.440
I don't doubt that there may be some legitimate illness that Jonathan may be encountering,

43:44.440 --> 43:47.320
and the evidence that there are some symptoms is very clear,

43:47.320 --> 43:49.880
but that does not suffice for the argument that you are making,

43:49.880 --> 43:51.880
which is much more preachy and radical.

43:51.880 --> 43:53.480
You are not just claiming that you are dying,

43:53.480 --> 43:55.480
you are promoting general doubt of a system,

43:55.480 --> 43:56.760
albeit not perfect,

43:56.760 --> 43:58.760
that has done a lot of good for many people,

43:58.760 --> 44:02.280
while promoting this single individual as some sort of miracle worker.

44:02.280 --> 44:06.120
I also thought it was funny that they would have agreed to go on an interview with Keemstar,

44:06.120 --> 44:08.920
but under the premise that they would know the questions before,

44:08.920 --> 44:10.680
which obviously didn't come to a head

44:10.680 --> 44:13.960
because they had no confidence in their narrative under further scrutiny,

44:13.960 --> 44:15.000
especially live.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.120
When people are suffering from an illness, they may become desperate,

44:18.120 --> 44:19.560
they are definitely vulnerable,

44:19.560 --> 44:21.800
particularly when looking for possible cures.

44:21.800 --> 44:25.720
Now as said, during the first video I have become so numb to their giveaways

44:25.720 --> 44:30.600
that they didn't even seem out of place in this much more sensitive content.

44:30.600 --> 44:33.880
In the two year old video where they talk about Jonathan's kidney condition,

44:33.880 --> 44:35.480
they do exactly the same thing.

44:35.480 --> 44:39.000
Who else would be completely used to Extreme Games' type of content?

44:39.000 --> 44:43.960
The core audience, the fanbase, the people who actually choose to click on every video,

44:43.960 --> 44:47.880
what happens when they hear these two guys talking about how they're dying,

44:47.880 --> 44:51.080
and how their last hope is this chiropract in California,

44:51.080 --> 44:53.880
and I'm not saying that an overwhelming number of people

44:53.880 --> 44:57.480
would be influenced by this sort of propaganda, which is what it is,

44:57.480 --> 45:01.240
but we've all been in situations where we've been looking for some sort of miracle,

45:01.240 --> 45:05.800
and whether knowingly or not they have asserted to provide an answer to that.

45:05.800 --> 45:08.280
In the original video this message was more subtle,

45:08.280 --> 45:12.760
but under pressure they cracked, that sounded like a pair of rather unhinged individuals.

45:12.760 --> 45:14.920
It is a scam, that's what it is.

45:14.920 --> 45:19.960
As noted, they also integrated the giveaway with a subscription to Dr John Bergman's channel,

45:19.960 --> 45:22.840
which once again is extremely impractical for multiple reasons,

45:22.840 --> 45:26.280
and something that a channel that size would not be able to organise,

45:26.280 --> 45:27.960
especially if they were dying.

45:27.960 --> 45:32.120
I know many people may be more focused on the aspect that they were trying to gain subs from

45:32.120 --> 45:35.720
a video in which they talk about their impending death through giveaways,

45:35.720 --> 45:38.920
but I'm more annoyed at the fact that they emotionally manipulated people

45:38.920 --> 45:41.000
into thinking that they were about to die,

45:41.000 --> 45:45.320
and then presented the solution as this miracle doctor who you should all subscribe to.

45:45.320 --> 45:47.800
It's unhealthy and pretty dangerous.

45:47.800 --> 45:51.960
I feel that if uninterrupted, they probably would have followed this treatment through,

45:51.960 --> 45:56.120
claimed to have been cured, and then used that emotional victory to try and sell the practice

45:56.120 --> 45:58.680
as further credibility for this chiropractor,

45:58.680 --> 46:03.000
as well as winning over all these fans who were ardently rousing for them to come through.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.400
I can't tell you if this plan would have worked,

46:05.400 --> 46:07.160
to be honest I'm kinda skeptical,

46:07.160 --> 46:10.200
but it was good that people did actually step in and say something,

46:10.200 --> 46:12.440
and actually point out what was wrong.

46:12.440 --> 46:15.080
Also, to add on to my two narratives here,

46:15.080 --> 46:17.880
the other character that has made appearances in these videos

46:17.880 --> 46:20.680
was our lord and saviour Jesus Christ.

46:20.680 --> 46:23.000
Before we literally prove anything to anyone,

46:23.000 --> 46:24.440
what we wanna say first of all is,

46:24.440 --> 46:28.280
we forgive every single one of you guys that has created a hate video on us.

46:28.280 --> 46:29.560
Every single comment,

46:29.560 --> 46:31.240
every single thing that any of you have said,

46:31.240 --> 46:32.120
we forgive you,

46:32.120 --> 46:33.960
because that's what Jesus Christ would do.

46:33.960 --> 46:34.760
He would forgive you,

46:34.760 --> 46:38.440
he would forgive you no matter what you've done to him if you go to him for forgiveness,

46:38.440 --> 46:40.520
and that's exactly what we're gonna do to you guys,

46:40.520 --> 46:42.840
cause Jesus Christ lives inside of us,

46:42.840 --> 46:45.720
and we forgive every single person that's created hate on us.

46:45.720 --> 46:49.720
However, it wasn't until two months later when they made their post recovery video

46:49.720 --> 46:51.240
that the truth becomes clear.

46:51.240 --> 46:54.920
Now this is the one video that I do not actually have the original copy of,

46:54.920 --> 46:59.640
so I'll just use the Leon Lush reaction video to both summarise exactly how I feel

46:59.640 --> 47:00.600
about their rhetoric,

47:00.600 --> 47:03.080
and suitably deliver the tone of the video.

47:03.080 --> 47:05.640
The person that has been there all this time,

47:05.640 --> 47:07.640
that we should have had our faith in,

47:07.640 --> 47:08.440
not doctors,

47:09.000 --> 47:10.280
not specialists,

47:10.280 --> 47:11.640
not anyone of this world,

47:11.640 --> 47:14.040
the person that we have put our faith into,

47:14.040 --> 47:16.040
his name is Jesus Christ.

47:16.040 --> 47:18.040
Now that is what we have done just recently,

47:18.040 --> 47:22.040
we have literally put our sicknesses into Jesus Christ's hands,

47:22.040 --> 47:23.800
and as you guys know if you've read the bible,

47:23.800 --> 47:25.560
or if you know anything about Jesus,

47:25.560 --> 47:26.680
he's a healer.

47:26.680 --> 47:29.320
He can heal you cause he is the son of God.

47:29.320 --> 47:32.440
He can do miracles and literally do whatever he wants.

47:32.440 --> 47:34.920
So we have put our faith in him and I tell you right now,

47:34.920 --> 47:37.560
yes I might still have a little bit of oedema left,

47:37.560 --> 47:40.280
but I feel no pain.

47:40.280 --> 47:41.800
It was in fact Jesus,

47:41.800 --> 47:42.840
Jesus healed them,

47:42.840 --> 47:44.760
Jesus was the person all along,

47:44.760 --> 47:47.080
in fact they didn't need any doctors at all,

47:47.080 --> 47:47.720
after all,

47:47.720 --> 47:51.960
those are the same doctors who had told Thomas that there was in fact nothing wrong with him.

47:51.960 --> 47:54.600
The only authority that you should trust is Jesus,

47:54.600 --> 47:58.280
and Jesus has made the conscious decision to heal those suffering gentlemen.

47:58.280 --> 48:02.520
Praise the Lord and his random healings of vertigo through California chiropractors.

48:02.520 --> 48:03.320
Now as mentioned,

48:03.320 --> 48:05.720
the lads have been promoting Christianity for a while,

48:05.800 --> 48:09.720
but here is one of the times where it seems to have been used for a less than benign purpose.

48:09.720 --> 48:10.920
Sometimes when people are down,

48:10.920 --> 48:13.640
bringing religion into their lives can legitimately help them,

48:13.640 --> 48:18.360
and I might even go as far to say the emotional uplift that religion can provide for some people

48:18.360 --> 48:21.160
might aid people's fight against certain illnesses.

48:21.160 --> 48:21.640
However,

48:21.640 --> 48:24.520
to me it seems like it's been used as a scapegoat here,

48:24.520 --> 48:27.400
as a way to explain how they have managed to heal themselves,

48:27.400 --> 48:30.600
and definitely to try and create a connection with the Christian crowd

48:30.600 --> 48:32.840
who will brand this as some miracle healing,

48:32.840 --> 48:35.560
and as proof that God does in fact exist.

48:35.560 --> 48:38.680
They have created this perfect arc where they were all going to die,

48:38.680 --> 48:40.200
they needed all this support,

48:40.200 --> 48:43.160
and when they had it they made a miraculous recovery,

48:43.160 --> 48:46.360
thanks to Dr. John Bergman and Jesus Christ.

48:46.360 --> 48:47.160
Amen.

48:47.160 --> 48:50.440
In the video they also state that their DMs are open on Instagram,

48:50.440 --> 48:52.440
and they are there to spread the message of God,

48:52.440 --> 48:54.840
and if you are interested you should reach out to them.

48:54.840 --> 48:59.560
This was basically a way of reaching out to the right audience who may be brought into this story,

48:59.560 --> 49:00.360
and believe me,

49:00.360 --> 49:01.720
although few and far between,

49:01.720 --> 49:03.480
they're definitely out there.

49:03.480 --> 49:04.600
Johnny and Tommy,

49:04.600 --> 49:05.960
you guys are amazing people,

49:05.960 --> 49:08.680
and for those of you who think they're pretending to be sick,

49:08.680 --> 49:09.320
screw you,

49:09.320 --> 49:11.720
cause these guys are strong believers in Christ,

49:11.720 --> 49:13.720
and they help me get through a lot,

49:13.720 --> 49:15.960
I know I can go to them whenever I need them,

49:15.960 --> 49:16.760
thank you.

49:16.760 --> 49:17.320
Now,

49:17.320 --> 49:17.800
once again,

49:17.800 --> 49:19.240
if they're helping people,

49:19.240 --> 49:19.800
you know,

49:19.800 --> 49:21.160
I can't take that away from them,

49:21.160 --> 49:22.120
but overall,

49:22.120 --> 49:24.360
as a greater cultural effect,

49:24.360 --> 49:27.320
I class these escapades as hope baiting,

49:27.320 --> 49:29.880
it's basically telling people that there are all these solutions

49:29.880 --> 49:33.560
that can be found in places that they need to just put their faith in,

49:33.640 --> 49:35.640
this problem solving entity,

49:35.640 --> 49:39.960
I feel that they are basically trying to couple themselves to that notion of hope

49:39.960 --> 49:43.000
with the intention of winning back an audience from the brink,

49:43.000 --> 49:44.280
which as Leon notes,

49:44.280 --> 49:45.480
wasn't the most hopeful.

49:46.040 --> 49:48.200
But it does seem awfully convenient,

49:48.200 --> 49:48.920
you know what I mean?

49:48.920 --> 49:50.360
Eight weeks ago we were dying,

49:50.360 --> 49:50.920
definitely,

49:50.920 --> 49:52.040
we're not lying about that,

49:52.040 --> 49:52.920
we were gonna die,

49:52.920 --> 49:53.480
vertigo,

49:53.480 --> 49:54.600
leaky gut,

49:54.600 --> 49:54.920
dead.

49:56.280 --> 49:57.560
JC hooked it up bro,

49:57.560 --> 50:00.040
JC came through in the clutch,

50:00.040 --> 50:00.840
not dead anymore,

50:00.840 --> 50:01.160
in fact,

50:01.160 --> 50:02.360
we're feeling great,

50:02.360 --> 50:04.040
be sure to like and subscribe.

50:04.040 --> 50:05.640
But was it all that simple?

50:05.640 --> 50:09.080
Was it just two guys using a load of shit to try and keep their channel afloat,

50:09.080 --> 50:11.880
or were they a bit more invested in it than I thought?

50:11.880 --> 50:14.840
Let's take a look back and try to come to a conclusion.

50:32.360 --> 50:42.120
I mean the one point in their favour is that they started preaching about their closeness to Jesus

50:42.120 --> 50:43.800
during their channel hire point,

50:43.800 --> 50:49.080
and therefore it seems unlikely that they just had conjured up this belief of Jesus for the sake of views.

50:49.080 --> 50:51.640
Maybe they did view their success as a miracle,

50:51.640 --> 50:52.200
I mean,

50:52.200 --> 50:53.560
I can understand why.

50:53.560 --> 50:55.400
I wouldn't put it down to Jesus though,

50:55.400 --> 50:57.800
I'd put it down to some rather crafty clickbait,

50:57.800 --> 51:00.280
which I'm not sure Jesus would approve of to be honest,

51:00.280 --> 51:02.760
though I haven't spoken to him so I can't confirm.

51:03.480 --> 51:04.680
Looking back at their history,

51:04.680 --> 51:06.920
they've really done anything to succeed,

51:06.920 --> 51:10.680
whether that was completely transforming their channel branding to a Pokemon channel,

51:10.680 --> 51:13.400
and then basically acting like that phase never happened,

51:13.400 --> 51:16.520
the only thing that remained remotely consistent was their giveaways,

51:16.520 --> 51:17.240
and in effect,

51:17.240 --> 51:18.520
I can understand why.

51:18.520 --> 51:19.960
And this is the strange thing,

51:19.960 --> 51:22.200
although they changed their content in and out,

51:22.200 --> 51:25.480
they clearly never really identified the content with the success,

51:25.480 --> 51:27.000
they identified the giveaways,

51:27.000 --> 51:30.200
because the giveaways were what provided them these subscriptions,

51:30.200 --> 51:32.040
the content was just filler to them,

51:32.040 --> 51:34.840
and the reason that I think they look at it from that perspective

51:34.840 --> 51:37.000
is because of how they use the Christian faith.

51:38.520 --> 51:40.040
When someone's channel begins to fail,

51:40.040 --> 51:42.040
they grip onto a formula more tightly,

51:42.040 --> 51:44.840
they try and use the same tricks to a greater extent,

51:44.840 --> 51:46.440
and you can see this with the land,

51:46.440 --> 51:48.840
both in their view of religion and giveaways,

51:48.840 --> 51:52.360
these are the only two things that seem to increase in their intensity

51:52.360 --> 51:54.040
when their channels begin to fail,

51:54.040 --> 51:56.680
they put their success in giveaways and Jesus,

51:56.680 --> 51:58.280
so when it begins to fall flat,

51:58.280 --> 52:00.440
they create a greater investment in it.

52:00.440 --> 52:03.320
Honestly, if they thought they could get away with crediting giveaways

52:03.320 --> 52:04.360
for saving their lives,

52:04.360 --> 52:05.720
then they probably would.

52:05.720 --> 52:07.880
That's exactly why their channel died,

52:07.880 --> 52:09.320
even if they haven't.

52:09.320 --> 52:10.680
If you want to keep people watching,

52:10.680 --> 52:12.600
you need to have faith in your content,

52:12.600 --> 52:15.800
not concepts that are mostly separate to what you're creating.

52:15.800 --> 52:17.880
Careers are seldom built on gimmicks,

52:17.880 --> 52:20.200
they're built on fleshed out characters who we appreciate

52:20.200 --> 52:21.640
not because of what happens to them,

52:21.640 --> 52:24.600
but because of how they react to their environments and evolve.

52:24.600 --> 52:27.960
Someone fighting a life threatening illness can be extremely riveting,

52:27.960 --> 52:31.480
but only because of how they respond to the battle that they are fighting.

52:31.480 --> 52:32.680
It's about character,

52:32.680 --> 52:35.560
and I guarantee that even if they had sold it to people,

52:35.560 --> 52:37.160
they wouldn't have revived their channel

52:37.160 --> 52:39.000
because they didn't show the character of someone

52:39.000 --> 52:41.080
who was genuinely going through those struggles.

52:41.080 --> 52:42.120
They may have found Jesus,

52:42.120 --> 52:43.960
but they haven't found the moral compass

52:43.960 --> 52:47.480
that many religious individuals would argue should come with him.

52:47.480 --> 52:50.120
It's the worst brand of religious exploitation.

52:50.120 --> 52:52.040
Jesus is the ultimate authority,

52:52.040 --> 52:54.520
and he helped us heal because he did.

52:54.520 --> 52:55.480
It's bizarre.

52:55.480 --> 52:56.280
It's a con.

52:56.280 --> 52:58.200
They're trying to connect people like that,

52:58.200 --> 53:00.360
and I just do not stand.

53:00.360 --> 53:01.560
And I'm no fan of religion,

53:01.560 --> 53:03.080
but I accept that, on principle,

53:03.080 --> 53:04.760
it has a moral compass,

53:04.760 --> 53:09.160
and I don't believe there's any way for these guys to remain inside the Christian moral compass,

53:09.160 --> 53:10.840
given the way that they have behaved,

53:10.840 --> 53:13.320
which leads me to believe that they're moral licenses,

53:13.320 --> 53:15.800
people who basically identify with these causes

53:15.800 --> 53:19.560
to make themselves feel better about not necessarily practicing what they preach.

53:19.560 --> 53:22.120
Maybe they're trying to justify it to themselves as well,

53:22.120 --> 53:24.600
but really, looking at it from a removed perspective,

53:24.600 --> 53:26.440
it could have been much worse than it was.

53:26.440 --> 53:27.880
People called it out early,

53:27.880 --> 53:31.800
and therefore the dissemination of a potentially harmful doctrine was suppressed,

53:31.800 --> 53:34.760
but they still have a responsibility for the intent,

53:34.760 --> 53:37.720
which they retained, as shown by their response video.

53:37.720 --> 53:38.680
Trust us, guys.

53:38.680 --> 53:40.360
They have removed these videos since,

53:40.360 --> 53:42.680
as said, they seem to enjoy removing content,

53:42.680 --> 53:44.600
but they haven't formally commented on it.

53:44.600 --> 53:46.680
If they do regret it, well, okay,

53:46.680 --> 53:48.600
it's not that I'm not willing to hear them out.

53:48.600 --> 53:51.400
In the instance that they were just really invested in this treatment,

53:51.400 --> 53:52.840
which I feel is unlikely,

53:52.840 --> 53:54.200
maybe they're not bad people,

53:54.200 --> 53:58.040
but what they did was excessively reckless and irrational considering their fanbase,

53:58.040 --> 54:00.280
and how impressible many of them seemed at the time.

54:00.280 --> 54:04.600
You don't deserve to have that responsibility given the possible repercussions.

54:04.600 --> 54:07.080
That fanbase was built from the start on giveaways,

54:07.080 --> 54:10.520
whether they were giving away a Clash of Clans account or an iPhone.

54:10.520 --> 54:13.720
You need to have some beggar's belief to sign up to a channel for that,

54:13.720 --> 54:14.680
and given that to me,

54:14.680 --> 54:17.800
they seem to be convinced that the giveaways are a catch to the channel,

54:17.800 --> 54:20.520
they had to know the audience that they were trying to rope in

54:20.520 --> 54:22.520
with a much more consequential narrative.

54:22.520 --> 54:27.560
Now, normally this would be the part where I talk about how their channel has died,

54:27.560 --> 54:29.000
due to these escapades,

54:29.000 --> 54:31.480
but also due to the fact that they could not evolve,

54:31.480 --> 54:33.640
which seemed to be a constant block for them.

54:33.640 --> 54:36.920
However, ironically, and maybe even depressingly,

54:36.920 --> 54:39.240
they've revived their channel very recently,

54:39.240 --> 54:40.760
and that is the problem with YouTube,

54:40.760 --> 54:42.840
there would be people who just don't know,

54:42.840 --> 54:45.400
especially when you make flavourless content.

54:45.400 --> 54:47.720
That was the problem with someone like Austin Jones,

54:47.720 --> 54:51.240
even though, of course, that was much, much more serious.

54:51.240 --> 54:54.520
Very briefly, after YouTube introduced abbreviated subscriber counts,

54:54.520 --> 54:57.080
you can see the ugly, rounded up number jump up

54:57.080 --> 55:00.520
in a way that it hasn't for maybe over a year at least.

55:00.520 --> 55:03.560
Basically, what they're doing now is a rip-off of more content,

55:03.560 --> 55:06.280
I mean, they even put Morgz in the tags of their videos,

55:06.280 --> 55:09.640
and given that Morgz is a rip-off of, like, five other YouTubers,

55:09.640 --> 55:12.200
it's hard to really argue that they've learned anything,

55:12.200 --> 55:13.880
they're just following the paper trail.

55:13.880 --> 55:14.760
What's in this?

55:14.760 --> 55:17.000
I'm genuinely shocked, I don't know what's in either of these.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.040
It's like it's Christmas before Christmas, Johnny, what is next?

55:20.040 --> 55:21.000
It's your turn!

55:21.000 --> 55:22.440
Alright, here we go then!

55:22.440 --> 55:23.400
No!

55:23.400 --> 55:24.280
It's a twin!

55:24.280 --> 55:25.320
That's not Christmas, is it?

55:25.320 --> 55:26.040
No!

55:26.040 --> 55:27.480
Not the most charismatic,

55:27.480 --> 55:30.680
although if they're not selling miracle cures to gullible audiences,

55:30.680 --> 55:32.040
I guess it's an improvement.

55:32.040 --> 55:35.240
Asking them to make decent content would probably be a step too far.

55:35.240 --> 55:38.840
I still feel that their behaviour will be fresh in some people's memories,

55:38.840 --> 55:41.640
given how forgettable they are for basically anything else,

55:41.640 --> 55:45.400
and they will never immortalise themselves in a way that other individuals can,

55:45.400 --> 55:47.320
because they coast on clickbait alone,

55:47.320 --> 55:50.280
and the fact that one video can get over a million views back to back

55:50.280 --> 55:54.520
with another video that barely cracks 50,000 is at least somewhat reassuring.

55:54.520 --> 55:58.280
However, their lack of personality is probably why they've had a spike in success again,

55:58.280 --> 55:59.880
because they are so damn forgettable,

55:59.880 --> 56:02.200
people probably forgot this whole charade,

56:02.200 --> 56:04.120
especially when they erased the history.

56:04.120 --> 56:08.040
Nonetheless, for the first time ever, they seem to have let go of old habits,

56:08.040 --> 56:09.080
there are no giveaways,

56:09.080 --> 56:11.720
and they may have finally clocked that successful content

56:11.720 --> 56:14.280
is not dependent on the number of giveaways you do.

56:14.280 --> 56:15.960
Maybe they just had to let go,

56:15.960 --> 56:18.360
which is something that they never could do before.

56:18.360 --> 56:21.080
If you wanna win an iPhone 11, we might be giving one away.

56:21.080 --> 56:23.080
Oh, never mind.

56:23.080 --> 56:25.640
Wait, we might be giving one away?

56:25.640 --> 56:27.080
Yes, an iPhone 11.

56:27.080 --> 56:29.080
They've really outdone themselves this time.

56:29.080 --> 56:31.800
I think on that bombshell, it's best to conclude.

56:33.080 --> 56:37.400
Extreme Games' breakdown was strange in a way that it was a sign of a dying channel

56:37.400 --> 56:40.680
trying to use old techniques to an insane extent,

56:40.680 --> 56:44.440
but also the attempt of a channel to understand what that means

56:44.440 --> 56:46.280
in the most tasteless way possible.

56:46.280 --> 56:48.840
They're constantly trying to retain the aspects of a channel

56:48.840 --> 56:50.680
with a greater connection with their fans,

56:50.680 --> 56:53.080
but their genre will never permit that.

56:53.080 --> 56:56.440
They will never be those sorts of creators, even if they die.

56:56.440 --> 56:59.880
They have to understand the humanity behind individuals

56:59.880 --> 57:01.800
and why we care about their lives.

57:01.800 --> 57:03.640
If you build your career on clickbait,

57:03.640 --> 57:05.960
we will never know enough about who you truly are

57:05.960 --> 57:08.680
to understand how you interpret your own struggles,

57:08.680 --> 57:12.120
and that's something Extreme Games could never really comprehend,

57:12.120 --> 57:14.360
how to market their own humanity.

57:14.360 --> 57:16.280
And it seems they've come to terms with it,

57:16.280 --> 57:18.360
and are now as successful as ever.

57:18.360 --> 57:21.000
It's just a shame that the journey to that destination

57:21.000 --> 57:23.400
has been pretty manipulative and destructive.

57:23.400 --> 57:25.000
I pray to God it was worth it.

57:28.200 --> 57:31.080
So yes, that was the video, I hope you enjoyed.

57:31.080 --> 57:34.760
It was an interesting one to script, certainly a bit longer than I anticipated,

57:34.760 --> 57:36.520
but that's what happens sometimes.

57:36.520 --> 57:38.600
I really want to give a big shout out to the editors,

57:38.600 --> 57:40.920
they've done a fantastic job, I am sure,

57:40.920 --> 57:43.720
and I would not have it any other way.

57:44.840 --> 57:47.320
I would also like to give a big thanks to my Patreons,

57:47.320 --> 57:49.640
$10 Patreons on the screen right now,

57:49.640 --> 57:52.360
give a special thanks to my $50 Patreons,

57:52.360 --> 57:54.360
Somehuller Blue, The Specter Angel,

57:54.360 --> 57:58.120
Bowright, Nico Deschamps, Sarah Elizabeth and Caroline,

57:58.120 --> 58:01.560
and a very special thanks to my $100 Patreons,

58:01.560 --> 58:04.200
Brandon, Adam Michael, and Christopher Karas.

58:05.320 --> 58:07.480
My Twitter is at The Right Opinion,

58:07.480 --> 58:09.320
my Facebook The Right Opinion Official,

58:09.320 --> 58:12.360
and my Discord, they're all linked in the pinned comment,

58:12.360 --> 58:16.040
and if you have any other questions then feel free to hit me up there.

58:16.040 --> 58:17.640
I hope you're having a wonderful day,

58:17.640 --> 58:19.080
my go is going fairly average,

58:19.080 --> 58:22.360
but hopefully something interesting can happen in my life soon enough,

58:22.360 --> 58:24.200
I know I've been waiting long enough.

58:24.200 --> 58:26.200
Anyhow, I don't really have much to add,

58:26.200 --> 58:28.440
so I'll leave it here, I'm The Right Opinion,

58:28.440 --> 58:30.840
and I will see you in the next one.
