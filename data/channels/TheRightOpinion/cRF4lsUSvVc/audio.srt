00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,840
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,840
much free time.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,080
And I think it's time we go talk about the gaming industry, but also with a cheeky bit

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,400
of politics thrown in there for good measure as well.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,900
For those who didn't know, I used to myself be a fairly political commentator, I intertwined

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,800
it with fairly media-friendly topics and even covered trending topics from time to time,

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,560
but I was pretty political, I'm not going to go into that much depth mainly because

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,280
I will likely save it for a special video, and I expect to be asked it for the Q&A.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,300
There's some statements I stand by, some statements not so much, ideas evolve, if you

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,120
care about it, you can DM me.

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,220
If I was still political, I think today's topic would be of my interest, however we

12
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,480
are running with it on my new format, because I think it is embedded in YouTube culture

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,560
enough to appeal to many people here.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,640
So it's a bit of old, bit of new, and anyway, there's an equally prominent reason that

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,280
I'm doing this, because probably to the surprise of some of you, I used to watch a

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,280
lot of Angry Joe.

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,280
I wasn't crazy about the streams and so on and many of the other smaller videos he

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,980
did, however I'd always tune in to some of his more long-form reviews, and even some

19
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,960
film reviews, you know the one with other Joe and that float with the beard, yeah, that

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,960
one.

21
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,600
And also as a person with OCD levels of pedanticism, I love lists, and in around 2014 at the turn

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,000
of the year, Angry Joe would drop 3 or 4 big fat top 10 lists for me to dig my teeth into,

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
dillish.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,800
I really enjoy a lot of review channels, they definitely encourage critical thinking, and

25
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,920
as someone who has always dreamed about being involved in the creative industry, it gave

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,080
me ideas that I might or might not want to do if I ever followed those arrows.

27
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,920
I haven't yet, though there's still time, and I've ended up here, what a place to

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
be.

29
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,080
Anyhow, central to that was Angry Joe, he didn't always provide his criticism in the

30
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,920
most constructive way, but he never held back, I mean it's in his name, what would I expect.

31
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,460
I enjoyed his passion balanced with delivery of valid criticism, and he also made his name

32
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,260
as a huge proponent of consumer values, which in spite of my criticism of certain people

33
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:01,220
of recent, I'm still a huge fan of people getting value for their money, so he definitely

34
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,420
played a fundamental part in my life and my YouTube career.

35
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,720
Another thing that I followed was his politics, it always appeared to me that he fell into

36
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,820
a moderate but passionate left, while still being empathetic towards other views.

37
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,900
This is particularly demonstrated when he covers video game controversies like in his

38
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,940
top 10 lists.

39
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,460
It was a few weeks back I was browsing the internet for the latest spice, and decided

40
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,020
to see if there were any new Angry Joe videos, I don't watch them on a particularly regular

41
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,220
basis at this point, mainly because of my own commitments, university and YouTube equally

42
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,380
take up their fair share of time, and I'm still expected to be social to keep up appearances.

43
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,180
However I noticed that one of his most recent videos had a particularly poor light to dislike

44
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,180
ratio, that being this cheeky bugger.

45
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,340
At the time I moved on I was just looking for videos to watch, however a few hours later

46
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,300
I heard that it was something a bit more contentious, and then someone messaged me,

47
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,380
and then some videos came out, and I was like, alright lads, what is the spice then?

48
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,420
Well to understand the spice, we have to go back to the roots, so let's take a little

49
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,420
trip.

50
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,380
This is Battlefield, I assume most of you know it, I sure know Battlefield, I personally

51
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,340
play Call of Duty more than this franchise, but that was only because at the time most

52
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,300
of my mates played Call of Duty 2.

53
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,780
Ooh, right opinion plated cause his friends did, yeah shut up mate, I was 13 and had to

54
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,100
manually decipher how socialising worked, I went through a period of copying and pasting

55
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,140
highest rated insults of a website onto my Facebook page, those were dark days, we don't

56
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,140
talk about them.

57
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,140
Get it?

58
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,140
Got it?

59
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,140
Good.

60
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,140
I realise I went off on a bit of a tangent there.

61
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:34,220
So Battlefield, it's a game, that people played, and gaming a few years ago was in

62
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,400
a sticky situation, you see there's this thing called Call of Duty 2, where both games

63
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,820
were released fairly regularly, annually for the Call of Duty franchise, now whereas many

64
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,160
games typically wait years to have sequels if they have sequels at all, this idea of

65
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,900
a game a year was properly ingrained into the culture, however like with every progression

66
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,960
you need new ideas, and so there was a chronological movement, typically forward, and with these

67
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,060
series we gradually, or even quickly depending on your perception, moved into the future.

68
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,740
And honestly, in many people's opinions, it was a bit shit, not because there was anything

69
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:11,460
bad about the idea, but firstly it had been done before, multiple times, and secondly

70
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,860
for many people the overwhelming amount of gadgets and flashy visuals seemed to replace

71
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,980
player skill, it just became all a little silly.

72
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:24,520
So Battlefield noticing this smartly decided to go back in time, to World War 1, for Battlefield

73
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,900
1, which was given great praise by many critics, because in spite of the slightly short single

74
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,700
player campaign it was supplemented by an excellent multiplayer which had some pretty

75
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,540
cool features, it was clear that there was a lot to enjoy about this game.

76
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,260
So following the success of Battlefield 1, they thought that they would keep up that

77
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,760
spirit in, and this time to shift to the World War 2 scenario, however, as would be

78
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,780
expected with any new game, changes were likely to be made, some new game modes, some alterations

79
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,740
to how the games played, and the one that vexed certain individuals, particularly those

80
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,900
vocal in the YouTube sphere, the introduction of a female lead character.

81
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,940
Now Joe decided that he would give his take on it, criticising those who thought this

82
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,140
way and going on to hypothesise a different explanation, and after sitting down and watching

83
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:11,340
it myself, the best way to describe his video would be confusing, however, with a bit of

84
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,400
research and understanding, I'm sure we can find a way to get the best side of both parties

85
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,000
in this circumstance.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,980
So today we're going to be re-entering the battlefield of politics, representation, video

87
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,560
games, and so much more.

88
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,100
And you know what, I think I'm more ready than I've ever been, despite the fact that

89
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,420
I'm currently recording with a duvet over my head.

90
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,820
This is what quality pays for, my friends.

91
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,500
So without further ado, let's get into this.

92
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,120
As assumed, Angry Joe's persona is angry.

93
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,680
What a fucking revelation.

94
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,720
That means that he typically tends to alienate a lot of people who he criticises, and believe

95
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,900
me when I say he does it a lot.

96
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,380
Now generally if you want people to come round to see your point of view, being angry

97
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,860
is not the best way to conduct yourself, however Joe's technique was never to have those he

98
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,420
criticised to see his point of view.

99
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,420
What do I mean?

100
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,580
Well to understand that we need to talk about corporations.

101
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,280
The hard truth is, which many of us have accepted by now, is that corporations do not really

102
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,900
care about how happy an individual consumer is with the product.

103
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,140
If you make a complaint, it will be filed away somewhere nicely, and it's essentially

104
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,540
a number to them.

105
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,540
But that number that is assigned does matter, because if the complaint is serious enough,

106
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,740
and it threatens to remove monetary funds, then having those sorts of complaints in volume

107
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,340
would be extremely concerning, because in the words of the famous philosopher, Mr. Krabs,

108
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,980
So a really good example of this is the loot box situation with Battlefield 2.

109
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:54,660
The sheer volume and animosity of the outrage caused such unprecedented levels of backlash

110
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,160
that EA, under the pressure of Disney, had to backtrack their implemented changes.

111
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,380
A lot of these corporate businesses will try their luck with the consumer, and push

112
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,140
these little amendments each time, grappling more money from the unsuspecting audience,

113
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,520
until they overstep the boundary and we tell them to fuck off.

114
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,920
And right central to that anger at the corporations was the man himself, Mr. Joseph Vargas here.

115
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,740
And this is why Angry Joe's rage is often effective in these situations, he knows exactly

116
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,600
how to direct it, when you're facing off against a mega big bad business, you need

117
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,600
someone who can mobilise the indignation within the viewer, they need someone to rile

118
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,800
up the people, companies like EA, to me at least, have proven themselves as not really

119
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,020
concerned with what the consumer wants, you can't present a reasoned argument to change

120
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:43,520
their mind, like you could change my mind, they need a different treatment, a firmer

121
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,960
hand, let's consider it tough love, EA, you're receiving my tough love, even though

122
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,600
I positively loathe you.

123
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,580
But anyhow, Angry Joe delivers that, and that's why people felt good about his content, because

124
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,300
it channelled people's feelings in a way that made them feel more inclined to be vocal

125
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,440
about it, it gave them a purpose.

126
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,620
We need people like that who can exert influence, and yes, in many ways it is good on that behalf.

127
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,220
He also has a habit of strawmanning, which once again in a way is fine, there's this

128
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,340
character, Corporate Commander, who is pretty much the satirical strawman on the corporate

129
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,420
mentality, which once again, when dealing with a level of truth, it's perfectly fine

130
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:24,820
as I've said before, as long as the exaggeration is part of the humour and not placed prior,

131
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,900
then we don't have a problem, and it's clear where it lies in this instance.

132
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:34,180
When dealing with companies, Angry Joe doesn't pull punches, which is important in a way.

133
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,740
However, when speaking to his fanbase, or even people who aren't necessarily his fans,

134
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,300
if you want to change mentality or behaviour, it can be just a simple case of speaking to

135
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,200
them with a tone of reason.

136
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,200
When dealing with audiences, there'll always be a set of people who are open to persuasion,

137
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,180
and a set of people who won't be so open to persuasion.

138
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,840
Now that can fluctuate depending on what audience you're speaking to, but for me,

139
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,880
it always pays off to be somewhat open to discourse in these scenarios, because even

140
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,820
if you only convince a few people, you know, that's a few people more than none.

141
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,060
With companies, you don't have to do this, mainly because there are a bunch of highly

142
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,860
educated individuals who can probably completely understand the reasoning behind every one

143
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,460
of your points, but choose to ignore it, because it's a free market, they can do what they

144
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,740
want for that sweet, sweet dollar.

145
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,180
With audiences, most of them don't tend to have that agenda, and as I said, this can

146
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,220
change within individual circumstance, but I think that's an important point for everyone

147
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,380
to keep in mind with today's topic.

148
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:34,700
I will likely have disagreements with people today, it doesn't mean you can't deliver

149
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,300
them in a way that may make them more empathetic to your point of view.

150
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,820
You can throw civility out the window if an individual is just being a dick, or is snidely

151
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,940
attempting to undermine you, those people can fuck off, but I hope I've made my point

152
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,940
clear.

153
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,220
The other thing is that directed anger works sometimes, and not so well other times, and

154
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,020
when dealing with large collectives who may have a variance in ideology, there are some

155
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:02,340
instances where you could say yes, the ideology is so illogical that it is beyond justification,

156
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,580
but generally, I don't think this is one of them.

157
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:09,620
So we've essentially dealt with what I believe are two key elements of justified anger, how

158
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,140
rational it is, and who the recipients are.

159
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,120
There are lots of little technicalities within that, but that's why we look at these situations

160
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,140
on a case by case basis, like today.

161
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,340
With the case of businesses being dickheads, Angry Joe was the firebrand game who was going

162
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:28,560
to stand up to these bad men, it always felt like a David vs Goliath, so even in cases

163
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,820
where the anger may have been overstated, the sheer fact that companies were so huge

164
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,600
just meant that people never felt remotely remorseful for doing it.

165
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,240
There are plenty of psychological studies that have examined how emotional interaction

166
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
works.

167
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,620
This sticks out to me, that when dealing with loss in mutual relationships, anger is much

168
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:52,200
less effective at responding to that than other emotions, I think that's important.

169
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,440
Now today's situation is disjunct from that study, though I do think there are familiar

170
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
sentiments.

171
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,400
When you direct anger towards a person for some alleged wrongdoing or disagreement, it

172
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,480
makes them much more likely to be provoked than necessarily be empathetic towards how

173
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,920
you view the situation, which makes them even less likely to being convinced or persuaded,

174
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,080
and more likely to just turn around and say fuck you.

175
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
Does that make them right?

176
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,080
No, not at all.

177
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,680
But if there's a better way to make people listen, why wouldn't you choose it?

178
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,440
Angry Joe has built his career off being angry, and galvanising people about affairs that

179
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,140
they might not have cared about otherwise, therefore it's almost likely that a lot

180
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:32,160
of his fans will be very passionate about topics, and may even demonstrate anger themselves.

181
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,700
I'm not saying that Angry Joe made his fans angry, in fact they may have been passionate

182
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,380
people long before they watched Joe's content, but when they did, his underlying passion

183
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,280
probably resonated in a way.

184
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,840
Your fanbase does tend to reflect you somewhat as a persona, not universally, but at least

185
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
partially.

186
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,060
Which leads us to this video.

187
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:16,000
With the concepts of anger explained, I think we can now apply it to this lovely piece and

188
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,820
explain why people may have taken a decent objection.

189
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,480
Let's quickly discuss the argument before we break down Joe's video.

190
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,000
So basically what I understand from my research, the comments, and the subsequent narratives

191
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,440
is that the inclusion of a female with a prosthetic limb in a game that is depicting a real event

192
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,860
should do it in a historically accurate manner, out of a level of respect for those who may

193
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,740
have sacrificed their lives during the war.

194
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,820
I will of course discuss my viewpoint later on this, but that is the basis.

195
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,620
Now in the intro I branded Angry Joe's video as confusing.

196
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,620
Why is that?

197
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:53,220
Well you see, the whole anti-SJW and women topic was actually kind of secondary to what

198
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,940
Angry Joe was discussing.

199
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,600
From what I'd heard, I was expecting this rant to be aimed at all the people who were

200
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,420
complaining about there being a female character in the new Battlefield game, but he more used

201
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,660
it as a springboard to explain why in fact the female character wasn't the main reason

202
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,260
that people weren't buying the game.

203
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,700
We'll discuss the credibility of those claims in a moment, but is the fact that it was a

204
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,360
secondary topic good or bad?

205
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,040
Well typically I'd lean towards saying it's a good thing, however in this instance I am

206
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,960
going to make a clear exception.

207
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,140
If it had been a passing comment it probably wouldn't have given the critics enough ammunition,

208
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:29,480
but he paid just enough amount of time to it to make it worthy of response, while at

209
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,500
the same time using it as a secondary topic meaning that he never actually responded to it,

210
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,280
he just presented it in this exaggerated manner.

211
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,120
In fact if you pay attention he barely provides any commentary on it at all, other than the

212
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,720
impersonations, which is in the sort of typical Angry Joe manner, the sort of exaggerated

213
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,080
character who takes the piss out of a mentality, with a little undertone of fury at those people.

214
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,340
We'll break down any specific details in a moment, but you can see why this probably

215
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,160
didn't come across too well.

216
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,020
You see Joe directed his straw man imitations and attitude partly towards the viewer, not

217
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:08,100
entirely, he does mention these YouTubers, but he definitely makes some general statements.

218
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,380
Now some of the YouTubers that he watched may have had an agenda to push, but a lot

219
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:16,620
of audiences are just looking for something to believe in, convictions to have, living

220
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,580
a life without opinion and discourse is very empty, opinions bring people together where

221
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,240
they're in friendship or discourse, and these people look at the arguments whether

222
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,820
from a partisan set of sources or not, and they deliberate what they think is the best

223
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,120
opinion to have.

224
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,280
I think firstly Joe underestimated the amount of people who felt this way, and the sort

225
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,620
of passion that they had about this topic.

226
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,040
Without being too cynical of his intentions, I doubt he would have spoken so disparagingly

227
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,480
of that position if he'd realised the depth of these ideas ran within many of his viewership,

228
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,200
I mean you can tell by the way he words it almost.

229
00:14:51,580 --> 00:15:21,020
Even if you're a strong, passionate person with strong, passionate opinions, no one goes

230
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,300
out to hemorrhage subscribers like that.

231
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,440
But Angry Joe wasn't really that angry in his video, I mean sure he's a naturally

232
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,460
provocative person, but as Ransco it was fairly low key, I mean his attitude didn't help,

233
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:37,340
but as a secondary topic did it require that level of vitriol, unfortunately that's what

234
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,140
Joe's architecture'd himself.

235
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:43,480
As I said earlier, when you're a naturally enthusiastic person, you're going to attract

236
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,760
naturally enthusiastic fans, and what happened is that this debate had been going on for

237
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,920
a fair bit of time, if he'd intervened early he may have been able to change some minds,

238
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,880
let alone wrap himself up in all this controversy, but he didn't, he waited for people to re-solidify

239
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,600
their opinions, tell themselves they were right, and then launch this video.

240
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,500
What about the video's points, well Joe expresses that there are different reasons

241
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,100
for why Battlefield's sales are failing, contrary to the people claiming it was the

242
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,280
female main character, and I do understand where he's coming from, I do think there

243
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,700
is probably an array of reasons for the failure in sales of New Battlefield, obviously the

244
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:25,440
timing and release between one of the most anticipated games in ages might well be a

245
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,480
significant factor, and the idea that it has been marketed terribly is another legitimate

246
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,880
point, I had really only seen one trailer, and it wasn't particularly awe inspiring

247
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,840
as trailers go, however there was a perspective that could've included this that definitely

248
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:45,100
seems viable to me, even as someone who seems sceptical of the whole explanation that many

249
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,900
others came up with, and this is a point that in my opinion should've been considered,

250
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,500
particularly regarding the marketing, when Battlefield 1 had their trailers released

251
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,480
in anticipation for the game they had the fact that they were completely changing the

252
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,380
style on their side, here was this trailer which was in a way a complete game changer,

253
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:06,380
with all the context, they had a completely different landscape to reflect these ideas

254
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,660
on and it was bringing back people to what they wanted, at the same time the presentation

255
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:15,140
of the trailer allowed them to introduce all these new elements individually, exciting

256
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,940
the audience while building up to this big fuck off airship.

257
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,820
So really when it comes to trailers, the background and the foreground elements are definitely

258
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:27,360
separate in how they can appeal to the viewer, now World War 2 is definitely different from

259
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,040
World War 1 in many ways, but stylistically with regards to the background they do bear

260
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:37,500
a set of similarities, so it no longer had the wow factor from Simple Premise, now this

261
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,020
in a way wouldn't have affected audience reactions hugely, in fact I'm sure most

262
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,020
people wouldn't have minded, but it definitely could've affected sales, on top of this

263
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,660
the trailer, despite being a whole minute longer than the Battlefield 1 trailer, just

264
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,240
threw a load of things on the screen at once and expected us to take it in, what was actually

265
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,040
in the foreground? Well as we've discussed, without having to concede too much it is kind

266
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:05,300
of this lovely lady here, she opens and closes the trailer fairly iconically, and even though

267
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:10,020
there are many components on screen, it's clear that there is a level of focus on her.

268
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,940
In my opinion, I don't really care about that, and to get this out of the way just

269
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:18,380
so people understand my position, a lot of history is not particularly intimate to me.

270
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,260
Does it interest me? Of course I take great interest in it, but when I go to play games

271
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,480
I play it for the fun rather than the historical accuracy, and therefore it doesn't really

272
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,960
bother me that they alter details, I mean it's a video game, if you wanted a realistic

273
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,600
game about World War 2, it would be slow and depressing. With that said, exaggerating

274
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,040
details is definitely different to changing details, and I do understand that for some

275
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,460
people, for an experience to be immersive, they take preference to certain elements being

276
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:50,680
accurate over others, and honestly the glamourisation of past events is inescapable to an extent.

277
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,480
The next point is discussed under the premise that the inclusion of a female character was

278
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,360
used as a marketing tool. Now although not explicitly stated, I feel that from how it

279
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,880
was presented, they were trying to bring attention to it. If you feel differently,

280
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,080
and that this was just a trailer with a character who happened to be female, then I completely

281
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,440
understand that, and this next point will not connect with you.

282
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,560
However, as a marketing tool by Battlefield, it is fairly futile. This is not the case

283
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:20,040
of having something groundbreaking, this is not a female Doctor Who, this is a character

284
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:25,800
in a video game. It appears to me that Battlefield either seriously overvalue the cultural impact

285
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:31,400
of their game, or severely misread the demographics. The point is about sales, and let's say

286
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,640
people don't care about the female lead. You know what, I agree with that, you know,

287
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,800
I don't give a shit, I think most people don't give a shit. Okay, so they have a

288
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:42,800
female lead, great. A lot of video games have female leads, when you play with people like

289
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,940
Shell, Athena, or many others, Battlefield doesn't have any rights to declare themselves

290
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:51,500
as a bastion for any causes, they had loads of time to do it before, and they're kind

291
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,240
of late to the party, everyone else has gone home. So instead of being lifted up by feminists,

292
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,320
they were shot down by historicists, it's hard to feel bad for them when the move seems

293
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,980
so bloody calculated. I think that's what stands out to me, it seems phony, and when

294
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,640
you have the biggest shill of the company, or the biggest ex-shill of the company, Patrick

295
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,820
Soderland, trying to use his daughter as emotional leverage in an interview, yes, I wonder how

296
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:19,380
many of his millions that he's fleeced from the consumer he's decided to donate towards

297
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,300
the causes that he suddenly cares about so much. I feel that regardless of whether the

298
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:28,100
sales have been affected by the timing, as a gaming company, you have to introduce something

299
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,220
that excites people, and that's what was lacking above all, plenty of games have introduced

300
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,700
controversial elements, that have upset people, but they still did relatively well with the

301
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,260
sales because they were original, and well thought out, and well marketed. That's what

302
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:46,460
I see with Battlefield, just a failure to capitalise on ideas. So I disagree with people

303
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,300
who say that it's the female character that has solely caused the decrease in sales,

304
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,820
because at the end of the day, even though many of our YouTube videos may pool some nice

305
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:59,140
views and we have a great set of fans to support us, we don't reach a majority of consumers,

306
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:03,260
many of whom are not concerned with politics, I only heard about gamergate when Angry Joe

307
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:08,260
included it when I was a gamer, we sometimes forget that we're not a central hub, Battlefield

308
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:12,900
1 sold 25 million copies at least, how many of those people are going to be watching us

309
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:18,780
ranting. However, the focus on a female character could definitely be symbolic of that absence

310
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:25,700
of creativity, no one left, right or centre likes a fair weather feminist, it's opportunistic,

311
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,100
like businesses are, but moreover than that, it's just bad marketing. So that would be

312
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,540
my response to Angry Joe, and also the people that he was responding to. I don't believe

313
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:38,520
in the narrative that it's just female characters impacting the sales, and I'd say that many

314
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,620
people do not care, but their focus on it could definitely have taken away from other

315
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:47,700
features that really should be more defining within the game, they're not as revolutionary

316
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,900
as they think. What I'm trying to say here is that there is clearly an overlap between

317
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:57,220
viewpoints, and there could have been this bridge built between understanding, and it

318
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:02,500
may have even convinced some people away from the narrative being created by a lot of these

319
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,220
other commentators that Angry Joe clearly feels are in the wrong, but he's instead

320
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:12,380
decided to completely castigate them, at the same time castigating the audiences, and

321
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,900
this is what really annoys me about the community in general, so let's discuss it a bit more.

322
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:25,700
I responded to the narrative that Joe responded to, I did not have to even address whether

323
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,920
I thought they should have females in the game or not, in fact, the only reason I did

324
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,180
was just so people could see my opinion, and maybe it would change a few minds, I don't

325
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,900
know, people may have their mind made up already. Angry Joe almost seemed to go out

326
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,540
of his way to make a jab at the critics of the inclusion of a female character in the

327
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:47,440
game, even though he didn't need to, which is weird because he then makes a second video

328
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,220
which is a response to another video, in which he says that people are annoyed because he

329
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,060
presented a different idea.

330
00:22:53,060 --> 00:23:20,860
And that's the thing.

331
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:27,160
I don't think the ideas that Angry Joe was trying to speak about were particularly bad,

332
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,340
it was just the tone that fired back on you, because in those instances, it doesn't matter

333
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:35,900
how valid your point is, if you have no respect to the people you present it to, then they're

334
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:40,880
not going to hear you out. For the record, I do not think Joe is a shill, Joe doesn't

335
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,660
seem to be defending any company conduct here, it's just impossible to work out who he

336
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:50,480
planned to respond to when he behaved with such hostility towards them. Let me present

337
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,880
to you a hypothetical scenario, and one that should serve as a base assumption in many

338
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,520
instances, at least in my opinion at least. You have a commentator, and he doesn't like

339
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,880
you, he's saying to all his fans, this is the truth, listen to me, do not listen to

340
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:10,240
them, they're wrong. These fans may be convinced, as I said, it's on a spectrum, how do you

341
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,120
respond? And when I say how, how do you speak to the fans? In this instance, Angry Joe doesn't

342
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,640
seem to understand that people, whether they're right or wrong in the way they feel, aren't

343
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,840
going to listen to him. It'd be like me, instead of starting off my video like I did

344
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,600
today, I would instead be going like this.

345
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:34,320
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the best opinion, where I show why you're

346
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,480
wrong. And today we've got Angry Joe, this ugly bellend who looks like he's the front

347
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:45,160
runner for 2018's Virgin of the Year, and today we have him trying to talk about video

348
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,120
games like he even cares about them, how adorable. We don't really want him in the community,

349
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,520
we just tolerate him, and when he's not rambling on about boring theories that no

350
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:59,820
one gives a shit about, he's attacking gamers, the ones he's supposed to be standing up

351
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:05,980
for, talking about how they're all sexist man pigs, yeah screw you buddy. Now he obviously

352
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:10,640
has received this treatment from many people, and I disagree with it firmly, and it just

353
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,600
shows how individuals value riling people up over actually trying to change their mind.

354
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,760
But this does not make Joe's point of view inexcusable, it just means that he's sunk

355
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,880
to their level. I feel Joe probably witnessed the backlash to the inclusion of a female

356
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,120
character in this scenario, and thought to himself this is all rather unjustified. People

357
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:33,160
were becoming riled up, he even says that himself, he probably had his reasons for thinking

358
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:37,560
that way. I also feel that it isn't necessarily worth the vitriol, and honestly I think there

359
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,920
are decent responses that can be made to the claims.

360
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,600
But I feel like these sorts of topics that people are trying to have discussions with

361
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:49,400
have gone to such shit of recent, and it was a trap that Joe just fell in. Which is why

362
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,120
I typed with this part preaching to the choir, because the sort of tone that's presented

363
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,980
is exactly what people who agree with whatever youtuber want to hear. They wanna hear something

364
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:02,280
to be pissed off, and then the person is pissed off and they respond in a pissed off manner,

365
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,320
and audiences on the two sides are never really interested in the context, they just wanna

366
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,080
hear the person they hate get dunked on by the person they like.

367
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,120
By buying into that demean himself, Joe probably does make some friends in certain places,

368
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:19,000
but is unlikely to change minds, which is really what I think discourse should be about.

369
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,040
Now once again, this is no pass to some of the people who made responses to him, they

370
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,680
were clearly lacking interest in convincing him, and more in stoking the fire, but they'll

371
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:32,300
have their time very soon. From my somewhat extensive experience, Joe likes to present

372
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:37,500
himself as an arbiter of the community and consumerism, and in a way he always has, and

373
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,180
by making these videos about top 10 controversies and providing his opinions on it, it tells

374
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:46,120
me that he's someone who really does want to cover these sensitive topics with nuance,

375
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,060
and gain respect from those in the community. I think the problem is he became a poster

376
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:55,160
child for what many of his critics wanted to make him out to be, in the battle of ideologies

377
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,580
things are so much more about presentation than they are about points, and I think he'll

378
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:04,660
regret how he spoke, because he's got himself caught up in the trap. When really his video

379
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:09,460
had some points that could have shifted perspective, everything got drawn to his assigned comments,

380
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:14,300
which weren't really necessary in the first place. Maybe that's his persona, maybe that's

381
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,420
what he wants, but I don't think it is, I think a series of choices in how he has

382
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:23,420
conducted himself led to this. He has attracted fans from all over the field with his firebrand

383
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:28,460
rhetoric and clear cut consumer values, but if he directs that attitude at those people

384
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:32,420
they're likely to respond in the same sort of tone, and also compose the narrative that

385
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:36,460
he doesn't stand for those very values that brought them there in the first place. I don't

386
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:41,020
believe he's not pro-consumer just for disagreeing with people's points of view on this topic,

387
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:46,100
it's not really corporatist-centric, I just hope that today this has been a more relaxed

388
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:51,620
view on the whole thing after it's all quietened down a bit. I think Joe is legitimately one

389
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:56,740
of the good guys, but unfortunately everything past has led to this presence, and he has

390
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:01,700
provoked part of it unto himself in this instance, and maybe in spite of the anger,

391
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,620
take some of my points on board.

392
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:08,540
Anyhow, that was the video, yes great fun, and we had a great time doing this one, as

393
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:13,460
I said duvet over my head, this is America, what joy.

394
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:18,300
However if my predictions are right, we probably have passed 50,000 by now so I really wanna

395
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:23,860
thank everyone for that, obviously I'll probably put out a tweet and YouTube comment too, but

396
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:28,500
let's make it official YouTube, thanks guys for all the support, it means a lot, 50k would

397
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:33,260
not be possible without these blokes, the editors, they have done once again a stellar

398
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:38,620
job of creating another masterpiece, and I cannot thank them enough. Go and send them

399
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,020
some love because they really, really deserve it.

400
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:46,580
If you wanna reach me, and I'm not responding to comments, my Twitter's at the right opinion,

401
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:52,580
Facebook as well, sometimes use that, links in the pinned comment, you're gonna love them.

402
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:56,300
I also have a Discord, which I have been a bit more active in recently, I told you

403
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:01,940
guys I'd pick it up, mainly text chat though, but you can still reach me on my account there

404
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,740
too, I try and keep everything open for those purposes.

405
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,500
Anyhow, I don't think I really have too much else to say, hopefully this audio sounds better

406
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:13,340
than my last one, or else I've just overheated myself for like 50 minutes, well I'm gonna

407
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:16,140
put my headphones on soon and find out.

408
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,980
Until then however, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

409
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:26,580
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
