00:00.000 --> 00:08.840
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too

00:08.840 --> 00:09.840
much free time.

00:09.840 --> 00:14.080
And I think it's time we go talk about the gaming industry, but also with a cheeky bit

00:14.080 --> 00:16.400
of politics thrown in there for good measure as well.

00:16.400 --> 00:20.900
For those who didn't know, I used to myself be a fairly political commentator, I intertwined

00:20.900 --> 00:24.800
it with fairly media-friendly topics and even covered trending topics from time to time,

00:24.800 --> 00:28.560
but I was pretty political, I'm not going to go into that much depth mainly because

00:28.560 --> 00:32.280
I will likely save it for a special video, and I expect to be asked it for the Q&A.

00:32.280 --> 00:36.300
There's some statements I stand by, some statements not so much, ideas evolve, if you

00:36.300 --> 00:38.120
care about it, you can DM me.

00:38.120 --> 00:42.220
If I was still political, I think today's topic would be of my interest, however we

00:42.220 --> 00:46.480
are running with it on my new format, because I think it is embedded in YouTube culture

00:46.480 --> 00:48.560
enough to appeal to many people here.

00:48.560 --> 00:52.640
So it's a bit of old, bit of new, and anyway, there's an equally prominent reason that

00:52.640 --> 00:56.280
I'm doing this, because probably to the surprise of some of you, I used to watch a

00:56.280 --> 00:57.280
lot of Angry Joe.

00:57.320 --> 01:01.280
I wasn't crazy about the streams and so on and many of the other smaller videos he

01:01.280 --> 01:04.980
did, however I'd always tune in to some of his more long-form reviews, and even some

01:04.980 --> 01:08.960
film reviews, you know the one with other Joe and that float with the beard, yeah, that

01:08.960 --> 01:09.960
one.

01:09.960 --> 01:15.600
And also as a person with OCD levels of pedanticism, I love lists, and in around 2014 at the turn

01:15.600 --> 01:21.000
of the year, Angry Joe would drop 3 or 4 big fat top 10 lists for me to dig my teeth into,

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
dillish.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.800
I really enjoy a lot of review channels, they definitely encourage critical thinking, and

01:25.800 --> 01:29.920
as someone who has always dreamed about being involved in the creative industry, it gave

01:29.920 --> 01:34.080
me ideas that I might or might not want to do if I ever followed those arrows.

01:34.080 --> 01:37.920
I haven't yet, though there's still time, and I've ended up here, what a place to

01:37.920 --> 01:38.920
be.

01:38.920 --> 01:43.080
Anyhow, central to that was Angry Joe, he didn't always provide his criticism in the

01:43.080 --> 01:47.920
most constructive way, but he never held back, I mean it's in his name, what would I expect.

01:47.920 --> 01:52.460
I enjoyed his passion balanced with delivery of valid criticism, and he also made his name

01:52.460 --> 01:57.260
as a huge proponent of consumer values, which in spite of my criticism of certain people

01:57.260 --> 02:01.220
of recent, I'm still a huge fan of people getting value for their money, so he definitely

02:01.220 --> 02:05.420
played a fundamental part in my life and my YouTube career.

02:05.420 --> 02:09.720
Another thing that I followed was his politics, it always appeared to me that he fell into

02:09.720 --> 02:14.820
a moderate but passionate left, while still being empathetic towards other views.

02:14.820 --> 02:18.900
This is particularly demonstrated when he covers video game controversies like in his

02:18.900 --> 02:19.940
top 10 lists.

02:19.940 --> 02:23.460
It was a few weeks back I was browsing the internet for the latest spice, and decided

02:23.460 --> 02:28.020
to see if there were any new Angry Joe videos, I don't watch them on a particularly regular

02:28.020 --> 02:32.220
basis at this point, mainly because of my own commitments, university and YouTube equally

02:32.220 --> 02:37.380
take up their fair share of time, and I'm still expected to be social to keep up appearances.

02:37.380 --> 02:41.180
However I noticed that one of his most recent videos had a particularly poor light to dislike

02:41.180 --> 02:43.180
ratio, that being this cheeky bugger.

02:43.180 --> 02:47.340
At the time I moved on I was just looking for videos to watch, however a few hours later

02:47.340 --> 02:51.300
I heard that it was something a bit more contentious, and then someone messaged me,

02:51.300 --> 02:56.380
and then some videos came out, and I was like, alright lads, what is the spice then?

02:56.380 --> 03:00.420
Well to understand the spice, we have to go back to the roots, so let's take a little

03:00.420 --> 03:01.420
trip.

03:01.420 --> 03:05.380
This is Battlefield, I assume most of you know it, I sure know Battlefield, I personally

03:05.380 --> 03:09.340
play Call of Duty more than this franchise, but that was only because at the time most

03:09.340 --> 03:11.300
of my mates played Call of Duty 2.

03:11.300 --> 03:15.780
Ooh, right opinion plated cause his friends did, yeah shut up mate, I was 13 and had to

03:15.780 --> 03:20.100
manually decipher how socialising worked, I went through a period of copying and pasting

03:20.100 --> 03:24.140
highest rated insults of a website onto my Facebook page, those were dark days, we don't

03:24.140 --> 03:25.140
talk about them.

03:25.140 --> 03:26.140
Get it?

03:26.140 --> 03:27.140
Got it?

03:27.140 --> 03:28.140
Good.

03:28.140 --> 03:29.140
I realise I went off on a bit of a tangent there.

03:29.140 --> 03:34.220
So Battlefield, it's a game, that people played, and gaming a few years ago was in

03:34.220 --> 03:38.400
a sticky situation, you see there's this thing called Call of Duty 2, where both games

03:38.400 --> 03:42.820
were released fairly regularly, annually for the Call of Duty franchise, now whereas many

03:42.820 --> 03:47.160
games typically wait years to have sequels if they have sequels at all, this idea of

03:47.160 --> 03:51.900
a game a year was properly ingrained into the culture, however like with every progression

03:51.900 --> 03:56.960
you need new ideas, and so there was a chronological movement, typically forward, and with these

03:56.960 --> 04:02.060
series we gradually, or even quickly depending on your perception, moved into the future.

04:02.060 --> 04:06.740
And honestly, in many people's opinions, it was a bit shit, not because there was anything

04:06.740 --> 04:11.460
bad about the idea, but firstly it had been done before, multiple times, and secondly

04:11.460 --> 04:15.860
for many people the overwhelming amount of gadgets and flashy visuals seemed to replace

04:15.860 --> 04:18.980
player skill, it just became all a little silly.

04:18.980 --> 04:24.520
So Battlefield noticing this smartly decided to go back in time, to World War 1, for Battlefield

04:24.520 --> 04:28.900
1, which was given great praise by many critics, because in spite of the slightly short single

04:28.900 --> 04:32.700
player campaign it was supplemented by an excellent multiplayer which had some pretty

04:32.700 --> 04:36.540
cool features, it was clear that there was a lot to enjoy about this game.

04:36.540 --> 04:40.260
So following the success of Battlefield 1, they thought that they would keep up that

04:40.260 --> 04:44.760
spirit in, and this time to shift to the World War 2 scenario, however, as would be

04:44.760 --> 04:49.780
expected with any new game, changes were likely to be made, some new game modes, some alterations

04:49.780 --> 04:53.740
to how the games played, and the one that vexed certain individuals, particularly those

04:53.740 --> 04:57.900
vocal in the YouTube sphere, the introduction of a female lead character.

04:57.900 --> 05:01.940
Now Joe decided that he would give his take on it, criticising those who thought this

05:01.940 --> 05:06.140
way and going on to hypothesise a different explanation, and after sitting down and watching

05:06.140 --> 05:11.340
it myself, the best way to describe his video would be confusing, however, with a bit of

05:11.340 --> 05:16.400
research and understanding, I'm sure we can find a way to get the best side of both parties

05:16.400 --> 05:18.000
in this circumstance.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.980
So today we're going to be re-entering the battlefield of politics, representation, video

05:23.980 --> 05:26.560
games, and so much more.

05:26.560 --> 05:31.100
And you know what, I think I'm more ready than I've ever been, despite the fact that

05:31.100 --> 05:34.420
I'm currently recording with a duvet over my head.

05:34.420 --> 05:36.820
This is what quality pays for, my friends.

05:36.820 --> 05:39.500
So without further ado, let's get into this.

05:51.040 --> 05:55.120
As assumed, Angry Joe's persona is angry.

05:55.120 --> 05:56.680
What a fucking revelation.

05:56.680 --> 06:00.720
That means that he typically tends to alienate a lot of people who he criticises, and believe

06:00.720 --> 06:02.900
me when I say he does it a lot.

06:02.900 --> 06:06.380
Now generally if you want people to come round to see your point of view, being angry

06:06.380 --> 06:10.860
is not the best way to conduct yourself, however Joe's technique was never to have those he

06:10.860 --> 06:13.420
criticised to see his point of view.

06:13.420 --> 06:14.420
What do I mean?

06:14.420 --> 06:16.580
Well to understand that we need to talk about corporations.

06:16.580 --> 06:21.280
The hard truth is, which many of us have accepted by now, is that corporations do not really

06:21.280 --> 06:24.900
care about how happy an individual consumer is with the product.

06:24.900 --> 06:29.140
If you make a complaint, it will be filed away somewhere nicely, and it's essentially

06:29.140 --> 06:30.540
a number to them.

06:30.540 --> 06:34.540
But that number that is assigned does matter, because if the complaint is serious enough,

06:34.540 --> 06:38.740
and it threatens to remove monetary funds, then having those sorts of complaints in volume

06:38.740 --> 06:43.340
would be extremely concerning, because in the words of the famous philosopher, Mr. Krabs,

06:45.340 --> 06:48.980
So a really good example of this is the loot box situation with Battlefield 2.

06:48.980 --> 06:54.660
The sheer volume and animosity of the outrage caused such unprecedented levels of backlash

06:54.660 --> 06:59.160
that EA, under the pressure of Disney, had to backtrack their implemented changes.

06:59.160 --> 07:03.380
A lot of these corporate businesses will try their luck with the consumer, and push

07:03.380 --> 07:08.140
these little amendments each time, grappling more money from the unsuspecting audience,

07:08.140 --> 07:11.520
until they overstep the boundary and we tell them to fuck off.

07:11.520 --> 07:16.920
And right central to that anger at the corporations was the man himself, Mr. Joseph Vargas here.

07:16.920 --> 07:21.740
And this is why Angry Joe's rage is often effective in these situations, he knows exactly

07:21.740 --> 07:26.600
how to direct it, when you're facing off against a mega big bad business, you need

07:26.600 --> 07:30.600
someone who can mobilise the indignation within the viewer, they need someone to rile

07:30.600 --> 07:34.800
up the people, companies like EA, to me at least, have proven themselves as not really

07:34.800 --> 07:39.020
concerned with what the consumer wants, you can't present a reasoned argument to change

07:39.020 --> 07:43.520
their mind, like you could change my mind, they need a different treatment, a firmer

07:43.520 --> 07:49.960
hand, let's consider it tough love, EA, you're receiving my tough love, even though

07:49.960 --> 07:51.600
I positively loathe you.

07:51.600 --> 07:56.580
But anyhow, Angry Joe delivers that, and that's why people felt good about his content, because

07:56.580 --> 08:00.300
it channelled people's feelings in a way that made them feel more inclined to be vocal

08:00.300 --> 08:02.440
about it, it gave them a purpose.

08:02.440 --> 08:07.620
We need people like that who can exert influence, and yes, in many ways it is good on that behalf.

08:07.620 --> 08:12.220
He also has a habit of strawmanning, which once again in a way is fine, there's this

08:12.220 --> 08:16.340
character, Corporate Commander, who is pretty much the satirical strawman on the corporate

08:16.340 --> 08:20.420
mentality, which once again, when dealing with a level of truth, it's perfectly fine

08:20.420 --> 08:24.820
as I've said before, as long as the exaggeration is part of the humour and not placed prior,

08:24.820 --> 08:28.900
then we don't have a problem, and it's clear where it lies in this instance.

08:28.900 --> 08:34.180
When dealing with companies, Angry Joe doesn't pull punches, which is important in a way.

08:34.180 --> 08:38.740
However, when speaking to his fanbase, or even people who aren't necessarily his fans,

08:38.740 --> 08:43.300
if you want to change mentality or behaviour, it can be just a simple case of speaking to

08:43.300 --> 08:45.200
them with a tone of reason.

08:45.200 --> 08:50.200
When dealing with audiences, there'll always be a set of people who are open to persuasion,

08:50.200 --> 08:53.180
and a set of people who won't be so open to persuasion.

08:53.180 --> 08:56.840
Now that can fluctuate depending on what audience you're speaking to, but for me,

08:56.840 --> 09:00.880
it always pays off to be somewhat open to discourse in these scenarios, because even

09:00.880 --> 09:04.820
if you only convince a few people, you know, that's a few people more than none.

09:04.820 --> 09:08.060
With companies, you don't have to do this, mainly because there are a bunch of highly

09:08.060 --> 09:12.860
educated individuals who can probably completely understand the reasoning behind every one

09:12.860 --> 09:17.460
of your points, but choose to ignore it, because it's a free market, they can do what they

09:17.460 --> 09:19.740
want for that sweet, sweet dollar.

09:19.740 --> 09:24.180
With audiences, most of them don't tend to have that agenda, and as I said, this can

09:24.180 --> 09:28.220
change within individual circumstance, but I think that's an important point for everyone

09:28.220 --> 09:30.380
to keep in mind with today's topic.

09:30.380 --> 09:34.700
I will likely have disagreements with people today, it doesn't mean you can't deliver

09:34.700 --> 09:38.300
them in a way that may make them more empathetic to your point of view.

09:38.300 --> 09:42.820
You can throw civility out the window if an individual is just being a dick, or is snidely

09:42.820 --> 09:47.940
attempting to undermine you, those people can fuck off, but I hope I've made my point

09:47.940 --> 09:48.940
clear.

09:48.940 --> 09:53.220
The other thing is that directed anger works sometimes, and not so well other times, and

09:53.220 --> 09:57.020
when dealing with large collectives who may have a variance in ideology, there are some

09:57.020 --> 10:02.340
instances where you could say yes, the ideology is so illogical that it is beyond justification,

10:02.340 --> 10:04.580
but generally, I don't think this is one of them.

10:04.580 --> 10:09.620
So we've essentially dealt with what I believe are two key elements of justified anger, how

10:09.620 --> 10:12.140
rational it is, and who the recipients are.

10:12.140 --> 10:16.120
There are lots of little technicalities within that, but that's why we look at these situations

10:16.120 --> 10:19.140
on a case by case basis, like today.

10:19.140 --> 10:23.340
With the case of businesses being dickheads, Angry Joe was the firebrand game who was going

10:23.340 --> 10:28.560
to stand up to these bad men, it always felt like a David vs Goliath, so even in cases

10:28.560 --> 10:32.820
where the anger may have been overstated, the sheer fact that companies were so huge

10:32.820 --> 10:36.600
just meant that people never felt remotely remorseful for doing it.

10:36.600 --> 10:41.240
There are plenty of psychological studies that have examined how emotional interaction

10:41.240 --> 10:42.240
works.

10:42.240 --> 10:46.620
This sticks out to me, that when dealing with loss in mutual relationships, anger is much

10:46.620 --> 10:52.200
less effective at responding to that than other emotions, I think that's important.

10:52.200 --> 10:56.440
Now today's situation is disjunct from that study, though I do think there are familiar

10:56.440 --> 10:57.440
sentiments.

10:57.440 --> 11:01.400
When you direct anger towards a person for some alleged wrongdoing or disagreement, it

11:01.400 --> 11:05.480
makes them much more likely to be provoked than necessarily be empathetic towards how

11:05.480 --> 11:09.920
you view the situation, which makes them even less likely to being convinced or persuaded,

11:09.920 --> 11:13.080
and more likely to just turn around and say fuck you.

11:13.080 --> 11:14.080
Does that make them right?

11:14.080 --> 11:15.080
No, not at all.

11:15.080 --> 11:18.680
But if there's a better way to make people listen, why wouldn't you choose it?

11:18.680 --> 11:23.440
Angry Joe has built his career off being angry, and galvanising people about affairs that

11:23.440 --> 11:27.140
they might not have cared about otherwise, therefore it's almost likely that a lot

11:27.140 --> 11:32.160
of his fans will be very passionate about topics, and may even demonstrate anger themselves.

11:32.160 --> 11:36.700
I'm not saying that Angry Joe made his fans angry, in fact they may have been passionate

11:36.700 --> 11:41.380
people long before they watched Joe's content, but when they did, his underlying passion

11:41.380 --> 11:43.280
probably resonated in a way.

11:43.280 --> 11:48.840
Your fanbase does tend to reflect you somewhat as a persona, not universally, but at least

11:48.840 --> 11:49.840
partially.

11:49.840 --> 11:51.060
Which leads us to this video.

12:06.700 --> 12:16.000
With the concepts of anger explained, I think we can now apply it to this lovely piece and

12:16.000 --> 12:18.820
explain why people may have taken a decent objection.

12:18.820 --> 12:22.480
Let's quickly discuss the argument before we break down Joe's video.

12:22.480 --> 12:27.000
So basically what I understand from my research, the comments, and the subsequent narratives

12:27.000 --> 12:32.440
is that the inclusion of a female with a prosthetic limb in a game that is depicting a real event

12:32.440 --> 12:36.860
should do it in a historically accurate manner, out of a level of respect for those who may

12:36.860 --> 12:38.740
have sacrificed their lives during the war.

12:38.740 --> 12:42.820
I will of course discuss my viewpoint later on this, but that is the basis.

12:42.820 --> 12:46.620
Now in the intro I branded Angry Joe's video as confusing.

12:46.620 --> 12:47.620
Why is that?

12:47.620 --> 12:53.220
Well you see, the whole anti-SJW and women topic was actually kind of secondary to what

12:53.220 --> 12:54.940
Angry Joe was discussing.

12:54.940 --> 12:58.600
From what I'd heard, I was expecting this rant to be aimed at all the people who were

12:58.600 --> 13:03.420
complaining about there being a female character in the new Battlefield game, but he more used

13:03.420 --> 13:07.660
it as a springboard to explain why in fact the female character wasn't the main reason

13:07.660 --> 13:09.260
that people weren't buying the game.

13:09.260 --> 13:12.700
We'll discuss the credibility of those claims in a moment, but is the fact that it was a

13:12.700 --> 13:15.360
secondary topic good or bad?

13:15.360 --> 13:19.040
Well typically I'd lean towards saying it's a good thing, however in this instance I am

13:19.040 --> 13:20.960
going to make a clear exception.

13:20.960 --> 13:25.140
If it had been a passing comment it probably wouldn't have given the critics enough ammunition,

13:25.140 --> 13:29.480
but he paid just enough amount of time to it to make it worthy of response, while at

13:29.480 --> 13:34.500
the same time using it as a secondary topic meaning that he never actually responded to it,

13:34.500 --> 13:37.280
he just presented it in this exaggerated manner.

13:37.280 --> 13:42.120
In fact if you pay attention he barely provides any commentary on it at all, other than the

13:42.120 --> 13:46.720
impersonations, which is in the sort of typical Angry Joe manner, the sort of exaggerated

13:46.720 --> 13:52.080
character who takes the piss out of a mentality, with a little undertone of fury at those people.

13:52.100 --> 13:56.340
We'll break down any specific details in a moment, but you can see why this probably

13:56.340 --> 13:58.160
didn't come across too well.

13:58.160 --> 14:03.020
You see Joe directed his straw man imitations and attitude partly towards the viewer, not

14:03.020 --> 14:08.100
entirely, he does mention these YouTubers, but he definitely makes some general statements.

14:08.100 --> 14:12.380
Now some of the YouTubers that he watched may have had an agenda to push, but a lot

14:12.380 --> 14:16.620
of audiences are just looking for something to believe in, convictions to have, living

14:16.620 --> 14:21.580
a life without opinion and discourse is very empty, opinions bring people together where

14:21.580 --> 14:25.240
they're in friendship or discourse, and these people look at the arguments whether

14:25.240 --> 14:29.820
from a partisan set of sources or not, and they deliberate what they think is the best

14:29.820 --> 14:31.120
opinion to have.

14:31.120 --> 14:35.280
I think firstly Joe underestimated the amount of people who felt this way, and the sort

14:35.280 --> 14:37.620
of passion that they had about this topic.

14:37.620 --> 14:42.040
Without being too cynical of his intentions, I doubt he would have spoken so disparagingly

14:42.040 --> 14:46.480
of that position if he'd realised the depth of these ideas ran within many of his viewership,

14:46.480 --> 14:49.200
I mean you can tell by the way he words it almost.

14:51.580 --> 15:21.020
Even if you're a strong, passionate person with strong, passionate opinions, no one goes

15:21.020 --> 15:23.300
out to hemorrhage subscribers like that.

15:23.300 --> 15:27.440
But Angry Joe wasn't really that angry in his video, I mean sure he's a naturally

15:27.440 --> 15:32.460
provocative person, but as Ransco it was fairly low key, I mean his attitude didn't help,

15:32.460 --> 15:37.340
but as a secondary topic did it require that level of vitriol, unfortunately that's what

15:37.340 --> 15:39.140
Joe's architecture'd himself.

15:39.140 --> 15:43.480
As I said earlier, when you're a naturally enthusiastic person, you're going to attract

15:43.480 --> 15:48.760
naturally enthusiastic fans, and what happened is that this debate had been going on for

15:48.760 --> 15:53.920
a fair bit of time, if he'd intervened early he may have been able to change some minds,

15:53.920 --> 15:58.880
let alone wrap himself up in all this controversy, but he didn't, he waited for people to re-solidify

15:58.880 --> 16:03.600
their opinions, tell themselves they were right, and then launch this video.

16:03.600 --> 16:07.500
What about the video's points, well Joe expresses that there are different reasons

16:07.500 --> 16:12.100
for why Battlefield's sales are failing, contrary to the people claiming it was the

16:12.100 --> 16:16.280
female main character, and I do understand where he's coming from, I do think there

16:16.280 --> 16:20.700
is probably an array of reasons for the failure in sales of New Battlefield, obviously the

16:20.700 --> 16:25.440
timing and release between one of the most anticipated games in ages might well be a

16:25.440 --> 16:30.480
significant factor, and the idea that it has been marketed terribly is another legitimate

16:30.480 --> 16:34.880
point, I had really only seen one trailer, and it wasn't particularly awe inspiring

16:34.880 --> 16:39.840
as trailers go, however there was a perspective that could've included this that definitely

16:39.840 --> 16:45.100
seems viable to me, even as someone who seems sceptical of the whole explanation that many

16:45.100 --> 16:48.900
others came up with, and this is a point that in my opinion should've been considered,

16:48.900 --> 16:52.500
particularly regarding the marketing, when Battlefield 1 had their trailers released

16:52.500 --> 16:56.480
in anticipation for the game they had the fact that they were completely changing the

16:56.480 --> 17:02.380
style on their side, here was this trailer which was in a way a complete game changer,

17:02.380 --> 17:06.380
with all the context, they had a completely different landscape to reflect these ideas

17:06.380 --> 17:10.660
on and it was bringing back people to what they wanted, at the same time the presentation

17:10.660 --> 17:15.140
of the trailer allowed them to introduce all these new elements individually, exciting

17:15.140 --> 17:18.940
the audience while building up to this big fuck off airship.

17:18.940 --> 17:22.820
So really when it comes to trailers, the background and the foreground elements are definitely

17:22.820 --> 17:27.360
separate in how they can appeal to the viewer, now World War 2 is definitely different from

17:27.360 --> 17:32.040
World War 1 in many ways, but stylistically with regards to the background they do bear

17:32.040 --> 17:37.500
a set of similarities, so it no longer had the wow factor from Simple Premise, now this

17:37.500 --> 17:42.020
in a way wouldn't have affected audience reactions hugely, in fact I'm sure most

17:42.020 --> 17:46.020
people wouldn't have minded, but it definitely could've affected sales, on top of this

17:46.020 --> 17:50.660
the trailer, despite being a whole minute longer than the Battlefield 1 trailer, just

17:50.660 --> 17:55.240
threw a load of things on the screen at once and expected us to take it in, what was actually

17:55.240 --> 18:00.040
in the foreground? Well as we've discussed, without having to concede too much it is kind

18:00.040 --> 18:05.300
of this lovely lady here, she opens and closes the trailer fairly iconically, and even though

18:05.300 --> 18:10.020
there are many components on screen, it's clear that there is a level of focus on her.

18:10.020 --> 18:13.940
In my opinion, I don't really care about that, and to get this out of the way just

18:13.940 --> 18:18.380
so people understand my position, a lot of history is not particularly intimate to me.

18:18.380 --> 18:22.260
Does it interest me? Of course I take great interest in it, but when I go to play games

18:22.260 --> 18:26.480
I play it for the fun rather than the historical accuracy, and therefore it doesn't really

18:26.480 --> 18:30.960
bother me that they alter details, I mean it's a video game, if you wanted a realistic

18:30.960 --> 18:35.600
game about World War 2, it would be slow and depressing. With that said, exaggerating

18:35.600 --> 18:40.040
details is definitely different to changing details, and I do understand that for some

18:40.040 --> 18:44.460
people, for an experience to be immersive, they take preference to certain elements being

18:44.460 --> 18:50.680
accurate over others, and honestly the glamourisation of past events is inescapable to an extent.

18:50.680 --> 18:54.480
The next point is discussed under the premise that the inclusion of a female character was

18:54.480 --> 18:58.360
used as a marketing tool. Now although not explicitly stated, I feel that from how it

18:58.360 --> 19:01.880
was presented, they were trying to bring attention to it. If you feel differently,

19:01.880 --> 19:06.080
and that this was just a trailer with a character who happened to be female, then I completely

19:06.080 --> 19:09.440
understand that, and this next point will not connect with you.

19:09.440 --> 19:14.560
However, as a marketing tool by Battlefield, it is fairly futile. This is not the case

19:14.560 --> 19:20.040
of having something groundbreaking, this is not a female Doctor Who, this is a character

19:20.040 --> 19:25.800
in a video game. It appears to me that Battlefield either seriously overvalue the cultural impact

19:25.800 --> 19:31.400
of their game, or severely misread the demographics. The point is about sales, and let's say

19:31.400 --> 19:34.640
people don't care about the female lead. You know what, I agree with that, you know,

19:34.640 --> 19:37.800
I don't give a shit, I think most people don't give a shit. Okay, so they have a

19:37.800 --> 19:42.800
female lead, great. A lot of video games have female leads, when you play with people like

19:42.800 --> 19:46.940
Shell, Athena, or many others, Battlefield doesn't have any rights to declare themselves

19:46.940 --> 19:51.500
as a bastion for any causes, they had loads of time to do it before, and they're kind

19:51.500 --> 19:56.240
of late to the party, everyone else has gone home. So instead of being lifted up by feminists,

19:56.240 --> 20:00.320
they were shot down by historicists, it's hard to feel bad for them when the move seems

20:00.320 --> 20:04.980
so bloody calculated. I think that's what stands out to me, it seems phony, and when

20:04.980 --> 20:09.640
you have the biggest shill of the company, or the biggest ex-shill of the company, Patrick

20:09.640 --> 20:14.820
Soderland, trying to use his daughter as emotional leverage in an interview, yes, I wonder how

20:14.820 --> 20:19.380
many of his millions that he's fleeced from the consumer he's decided to donate towards

20:19.380 --> 20:23.300
the causes that he suddenly cares about so much. I feel that regardless of whether the

20:23.300 --> 20:28.100
sales have been affected by the timing, as a gaming company, you have to introduce something

20:28.100 --> 20:32.220
that excites people, and that's what was lacking above all, plenty of games have introduced

20:32.220 --> 20:36.700
controversial elements, that have upset people, but they still did relatively well with the

20:36.700 --> 20:41.260
sales because they were original, and well thought out, and well marketed. That's what

20:41.260 --> 20:46.460
I see with Battlefield, just a failure to capitalise on ideas. So I disagree with people

20:46.460 --> 20:50.300
who say that it's the female character that has solely caused the decrease in sales,

20:50.300 --> 20:53.820
because at the end of the day, even though many of our YouTube videos may pool some nice

20:53.820 --> 20:59.140
views and we have a great set of fans to support us, we don't reach a majority of consumers,

20:59.140 --> 21:03.260
many of whom are not concerned with politics, I only heard about gamergate when Angry Joe

21:03.260 --> 21:08.260
included it when I was a gamer, we sometimes forget that we're not a central hub, Battlefield

21:08.260 --> 21:12.900
1 sold 25 million copies at least, how many of those people are going to be watching us

21:12.900 --> 21:18.780
ranting. However, the focus on a female character could definitely be symbolic of that absence

21:18.780 --> 21:25.700
of creativity, no one left, right or centre likes a fair weather feminist, it's opportunistic,

21:25.700 --> 21:30.100
like businesses are, but moreover than that, it's just bad marketing. So that would be

21:30.100 --> 21:34.540
my response to Angry Joe, and also the people that he was responding to. I don't believe

21:34.540 --> 21:38.520
in the narrative that it's just female characters impacting the sales, and I'd say that many

21:38.520 --> 21:42.620
people do not care, but their focus on it could definitely have taken away from other

21:42.620 --> 21:47.700
features that really should be more defining within the game, they're not as revolutionary

21:47.700 --> 21:52.900
as they think. What I'm trying to say here is that there is clearly an overlap between

21:52.900 --> 21:57.220
viewpoints, and there could have been this bridge built between understanding, and it

21:57.220 --> 22:02.500
may have even convinced some people away from the narrative being created by a lot of these

22:02.500 --> 22:07.220
other commentators that Angry Joe clearly feels are in the wrong, but he's instead

22:07.220 --> 22:12.380
decided to completely castigate them, at the same time castigating the audiences, and

22:12.380 --> 22:16.900
this is what really annoys me about the community in general, so let's discuss it a bit more.

22:20.260 --> 22:25.700
I responded to the narrative that Joe responded to, I did not have to even address whether

22:25.700 --> 22:29.920
I thought they should have females in the game or not, in fact, the only reason I did

22:29.920 --> 22:34.180
was just so people could see my opinion, and maybe it would change a few minds, I don't

22:34.180 --> 22:37.900
know, people may have their mind made up already. Angry Joe almost seemed to go out

22:37.900 --> 22:42.540
of his way to make a jab at the critics of the inclusion of a female character in the

22:42.540 --> 22:47.440
game, even though he didn't need to, which is weird because he then makes a second video

22:47.440 --> 22:51.220
which is a response to another video, in which he says that people are annoyed because he

22:51.220 --> 22:53.060
presented a different idea.

22:53.060 --> 23:20.860
And that's the thing.

23:20.860 --> 23:27.160
I don't think the ideas that Angry Joe was trying to speak about were particularly bad,

23:27.160 --> 23:31.340
it was just the tone that fired back on you, because in those instances, it doesn't matter

23:31.340 --> 23:35.900
how valid your point is, if you have no respect to the people you present it to, then they're

23:35.900 --> 23:40.880
not going to hear you out. For the record, I do not think Joe is a shill, Joe doesn't

23:40.880 --> 23:45.660
seem to be defending any company conduct here, it's just impossible to work out who he

23:45.660 --> 23:50.480
planned to respond to when he behaved with such hostility towards them. Let me present

23:50.480 --> 23:54.880
to you a hypothetical scenario, and one that should serve as a base assumption in many

23:54.880 --> 23:59.520
instances, at least in my opinion at least. You have a commentator, and he doesn't like

23:59.520 --> 24:03.880
you, he's saying to all his fans, this is the truth, listen to me, do not listen to

24:03.880 --> 24:10.240
them, they're wrong. These fans may be convinced, as I said, it's on a spectrum, how do you

24:10.240 --> 24:16.120
respond? And when I say how, how do you speak to the fans? In this instance, Angry Joe doesn't

24:16.120 --> 24:20.640
seem to understand that people, whether they're right or wrong in the way they feel, aren't

24:20.640 --> 24:24.840
going to listen to him. It'd be like me, instead of starting off my video like I did

24:24.840 --> 24:27.600
today, I would instead be going like this.

24:27.600 --> 24:34.320
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the best opinion, where I show why you're

24:34.320 --> 24:39.480
wrong. And today we've got Angry Joe, this ugly bellend who looks like he's the front

24:39.480 --> 24:45.160
runner for 2018's Virgin of the Year, and today we have him trying to talk about video

24:45.200 --> 24:50.120
games like he even cares about them, how adorable. We don't really want him in the community,

24:50.120 --> 24:54.520
we just tolerate him, and when he's not rambling on about boring theories that no

24:54.520 --> 24:59.820
one gives a shit about, he's attacking gamers, the ones he's supposed to be standing up

24:59.820 --> 25:05.980
for, talking about how they're all sexist man pigs, yeah screw you buddy. Now he obviously

25:05.980 --> 25:10.640
has received this treatment from many people, and I disagree with it firmly, and it just

25:10.640 --> 25:15.600
shows how individuals value riling people up over actually trying to change their mind.

25:15.600 --> 25:19.760
But this does not make Joe's point of view inexcusable, it just means that he's sunk

25:19.760 --> 25:23.880
to their level. I feel Joe probably witnessed the backlash to the inclusion of a female

25:23.880 --> 25:28.120
character in this scenario, and thought to himself this is all rather unjustified. People

25:28.120 --> 25:33.160
were becoming riled up, he even says that himself, he probably had his reasons for thinking

25:33.160 --> 25:37.560
that way. I also feel that it isn't necessarily worth the vitriol, and honestly I think there

25:37.560 --> 25:40.920
are decent responses that can be made to the claims.

25:40.920 --> 25:44.600
But I feel like these sorts of topics that people are trying to have discussions with

25:44.600 --> 25:49.400
have gone to such shit of recent, and it was a trap that Joe just fell in. Which is why

25:49.400 --> 25:53.120
I typed with this part preaching to the choir, because the sort of tone that's presented

25:53.120 --> 25:57.980
is exactly what people who agree with whatever youtuber want to hear. They wanna hear something

25:57.980 --> 26:02.280
to be pissed off, and then the person is pissed off and they respond in a pissed off manner,

26:02.280 --> 26:06.320
and audiences on the two sides are never really interested in the context, they just wanna

26:06.320 --> 26:10.080
hear the person they hate get dunked on by the person they like.

26:10.080 --> 26:14.120
By buying into that demean himself, Joe probably does make some friends in certain places,

26:14.120 --> 26:19.000
but is unlikely to change minds, which is really what I think discourse should be about.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.040
Now once again, this is no pass to some of the people who made responses to him, they

26:23.040 --> 26:27.680
were clearly lacking interest in convincing him, and more in stoking the fire, but they'll

26:27.680 --> 26:32.300
have their time very soon. From my somewhat extensive experience, Joe likes to present

26:32.300 --> 26:37.500
himself as an arbiter of the community and consumerism, and in a way he always has, and

26:37.500 --> 26:42.180
by making these videos about top 10 controversies and providing his opinions on it, it tells

26:42.180 --> 26:46.120
me that he's someone who really does want to cover these sensitive topics with nuance,

26:46.120 --> 26:50.060
and gain respect from those in the community. I think the problem is he became a poster

26:50.060 --> 26:55.160
child for what many of his critics wanted to make him out to be, in the battle of ideologies

26:55.160 --> 26:59.580
things are so much more about presentation than they are about points, and I think he'll

26:59.580 --> 27:04.660
regret how he spoke, because he's got himself caught up in the trap. When really his video

27:04.660 --> 27:09.460
had some points that could have shifted perspective, everything got drawn to his assigned comments,

27:09.460 --> 27:14.300
which weren't really necessary in the first place. Maybe that's his persona, maybe that's

27:14.300 --> 27:18.420
what he wants, but I don't think it is, I think a series of choices in how he has

27:18.420 --> 27:23.420
conducted himself led to this. He has attracted fans from all over the field with his firebrand

27:23.420 --> 27:28.460
rhetoric and clear cut consumer values, but if he directs that attitude at those people

27:28.460 --> 27:32.420
they're likely to respond in the same sort of tone, and also compose the narrative that

27:32.420 --> 27:36.460
he doesn't stand for those very values that brought them there in the first place. I don't

27:36.460 --> 27:41.020
believe he's not pro-consumer just for disagreeing with people's points of view on this topic,

27:41.020 --> 27:46.100
it's not really corporatist-centric, I just hope that today this has been a more relaxed

27:46.100 --> 27:51.620
view on the whole thing after it's all quietened down a bit. I think Joe is legitimately one

27:51.620 --> 27:56.740
of the good guys, but unfortunately everything past has led to this presence, and he has

27:56.740 --> 28:01.700
provoked part of it unto himself in this instance, and maybe in spite of the anger,

28:01.700 --> 28:03.620
take some of my points on board.

28:03.620 --> 28:08.540
Anyhow, that was the video, yes great fun, and we had a great time doing this one, as

28:08.540 --> 28:13.460
I said duvet over my head, this is America, what joy.

28:13.460 --> 28:18.300
However if my predictions are right, we probably have passed 50,000 by now so I really wanna

28:18.300 --> 28:23.860
thank everyone for that, obviously I'll probably put out a tweet and YouTube comment too, but

28:23.860 --> 28:28.500
let's make it official YouTube, thanks guys for all the support, it means a lot, 50k would

28:28.500 --> 28:33.260
not be possible without these blokes, the editors, they have done once again a stellar

28:33.260 --> 28:38.620
job of creating another masterpiece, and I cannot thank them enough. Go and send them

28:38.620 --> 28:41.020
some love because they really, really deserve it.

28:41.020 --> 28:46.580
If you wanna reach me, and I'm not responding to comments, my Twitter's at the right opinion,

28:46.580 --> 28:52.580
Facebook as well, sometimes use that, links in the pinned comment, you're gonna love them.

28:52.580 --> 28:56.300
I also have a Discord, which I have been a bit more active in recently, I told you

28:56.300 --> 29:01.940
guys I'd pick it up, mainly text chat though, but you can still reach me on my account there

29:01.940 --> 29:04.740
too, I try and keep everything open for those purposes.

29:04.740 --> 29:08.500
Anyhow, I don't think I really have too much else to say, hopefully this audio sounds better

29:08.500 --> 29:13.340
than my last one, or else I've just overheated myself for like 50 minutes, well I'm gonna

29:13.340 --> 29:16.140
put my headphones on soon and find out.

29:16.140 --> 29:19.980
Until then however, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.

29:22.580 --> 29:26.580
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
