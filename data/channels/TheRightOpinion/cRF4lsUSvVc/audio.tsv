0	8840	Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too
8840	9840	much free time.
9840	14080	And I think it's time we go talk about the gaming industry, but also with a cheeky bit
14080	16400	of politics thrown in there for good measure as well.
16400	20900	For those who didn't know, I used to myself be a fairly political commentator, I intertwined
20900	24800	it with fairly media-friendly topics and even covered trending topics from time to time,
24800	28560	but I was pretty political, I'm not going to go into that much depth mainly because
28560	32280	I will likely save it for a special video, and I expect to be asked it for the Q&A.
32280	36300	There's some statements I stand by, some statements not so much, ideas evolve, if you
36300	38120	care about it, you can DM me.
38120	42220	If I was still political, I think today's topic would be of my interest, however we
42220	46480	are running with it on my new format, because I think it is embedded in YouTube culture
46480	48560	enough to appeal to many people here.
48560	52640	So it's a bit of old, bit of new, and anyway, there's an equally prominent reason that
52640	56280	I'm doing this, because probably to the surprise of some of you, I used to watch a
56280	57280	lot of Angry Joe.
57320	61280	I wasn't crazy about the streams and so on and many of the other smaller videos he
61280	64980	did, however I'd always tune in to some of his more long-form reviews, and even some
64980	68960	film reviews, you know the one with other Joe and that float with the beard, yeah, that
68960	69960	one.
69960	75600	And also as a person with OCD levels of pedanticism, I love lists, and in around 2014 at the turn
75600	81000	of the year, Angry Joe would drop 3 or 4 big fat top 10 lists for me to dig my teeth into,
81000	82000	dillish.
82000	85800	I really enjoy a lot of review channels, they definitely encourage critical thinking, and
85800	89920	as someone who has always dreamed about being involved in the creative industry, it gave
89920	94080	me ideas that I might or might not want to do if I ever followed those arrows.
94080	97920	I haven't yet, though there's still time, and I've ended up here, what a place to
97920	98920	be.
98920	103080	Anyhow, central to that was Angry Joe, he didn't always provide his criticism in the
103080	107920	most constructive way, but he never held back, I mean it's in his name, what would I expect.
107920	112460	I enjoyed his passion balanced with delivery of valid criticism, and he also made his name
112460	117260	as a huge proponent of consumer values, which in spite of my criticism of certain people
117260	121220	of recent, I'm still a huge fan of people getting value for their money, so he definitely
121220	125420	played a fundamental part in my life and my YouTube career.
125420	129720	Another thing that I followed was his politics, it always appeared to me that he fell into
129720	134820	a moderate but passionate left, while still being empathetic towards other views.
134820	138900	This is particularly demonstrated when he covers video game controversies like in his
138900	139940	top 10 lists.
139940	143460	It was a few weeks back I was browsing the internet for the latest spice, and decided
143460	148020	to see if there were any new Angry Joe videos, I don't watch them on a particularly regular
148020	152220	basis at this point, mainly because of my own commitments, university and YouTube equally
152220	157380	take up their fair share of time, and I'm still expected to be social to keep up appearances.
157380	161180	However I noticed that one of his most recent videos had a particularly poor light to dislike
161180	163180	ratio, that being this cheeky bugger.
163180	167340	At the time I moved on I was just looking for videos to watch, however a few hours later
167340	171300	I heard that it was something a bit more contentious, and then someone messaged me,
171300	176380	and then some videos came out, and I was like, alright lads, what is the spice then?
176380	180420	Well to understand the spice, we have to go back to the roots, so let's take a little
180420	181420	trip.
181420	185380	This is Battlefield, I assume most of you know it, I sure know Battlefield, I personally
185380	189340	play Call of Duty more than this franchise, but that was only because at the time most
189340	191300	of my mates played Call of Duty 2.
191300	195780	Ooh, right opinion plated cause his friends did, yeah shut up mate, I was 13 and had to
195780	200100	manually decipher how socialising worked, I went through a period of copying and pasting
200100	204140	highest rated insults of a website onto my Facebook page, those were dark days, we don't
204140	205140	talk about them.
205140	206140	Get it?
206140	207140	Got it?
207140	208140	Good.
208140	209140	I realise I went off on a bit of a tangent there.
209140	214220	So Battlefield, it's a game, that people played, and gaming a few years ago was in
214220	218400	a sticky situation, you see there's this thing called Call of Duty 2, where both games
218400	222820	were released fairly regularly, annually for the Call of Duty franchise, now whereas many
222820	227160	games typically wait years to have sequels if they have sequels at all, this idea of
227160	231900	a game a year was properly ingrained into the culture, however like with every progression
231900	236960	you need new ideas, and so there was a chronological movement, typically forward, and with these
236960	242060	series we gradually, or even quickly depending on your perception, moved into the future.
242060	246740	And honestly, in many people's opinions, it was a bit shit, not because there was anything
246740	251460	bad about the idea, but firstly it had been done before, multiple times, and secondly
251460	255860	for many people the overwhelming amount of gadgets and flashy visuals seemed to replace
255860	258980	player skill, it just became all a little silly.
258980	264520	So Battlefield noticing this smartly decided to go back in time, to World War 1, for Battlefield
264520	268900	1, which was given great praise by many critics, because in spite of the slightly short single
268900	272700	player campaign it was supplemented by an excellent multiplayer which had some pretty
272700	276540	cool features, it was clear that there was a lot to enjoy about this game.
276540	280260	So following the success of Battlefield 1, they thought that they would keep up that
280260	284760	spirit in, and this time to shift to the World War 2 scenario, however, as would be
284760	289780	expected with any new game, changes were likely to be made, some new game modes, some alterations
289780	293740	to how the games played, and the one that vexed certain individuals, particularly those
293740	297900	vocal in the YouTube sphere, the introduction of a female lead character.
297900	301940	Now Joe decided that he would give his take on it, criticising those who thought this
301940	306140	way and going on to hypothesise a different explanation, and after sitting down and watching
306140	311340	it myself, the best way to describe his video would be confusing, however, with a bit of
311340	316400	research and understanding, I'm sure we can find a way to get the best side of both parties
316400	318000	in this circumstance.
318000	323980	So today we're going to be re-entering the battlefield of politics, representation, video
323980	326560	games, and so much more.
326560	331100	And you know what, I think I'm more ready than I've ever been, despite the fact that
331100	334420	I'm currently recording with a duvet over my head.
334420	336820	This is what quality pays for, my friends.
336820	339500	So without further ado, let's get into this.
351040	355120	As assumed, Angry Joe's persona is angry.
355120	356680	What a fucking revelation.
356680	360720	That means that he typically tends to alienate a lot of people who he criticises, and believe
360720	362900	me when I say he does it a lot.
362900	366380	Now generally if you want people to come round to see your point of view, being angry
366380	370860	is not the best way to conduct yourself, however Joe's technique was never to have those he
370860	373420	criticised to see his point of view.
373420	374420	What do I mean?
374420	376580	Well to understand that we need to talk about corporations.
376580	381280	The hard truth is, which many of us have accepted by now, is that corporations do not really
381280	384900	care about how happy an individual consumer is with the product.
384900	389140	If you make a complaint, it will be filed away somewhere nicely, and it's essentially
389140	390540	a number to them.
390540	394540	But that number that is assigned does matter, because if the complaint is serious enough,
394540	398740	and it threatens to remove monetary funds, then having those sorts of complaints in volume
398740	403340	would be extremely concerning, because in the words of the famous philosopher, Mr. Krabs,
405340	408980	So a really good example of this is the loot box situation with Battlefield 2.
408980	414660	The sheer volume and animosity of the outrage caused such unprecedented levels of backlash
414660	419160	that EA, under the pressure of Disney, had to backtrack their implemented changes.
419160	423380	A lot of these corporate businesses will try their luck with the consumer, and push
423380	428140	these little amendments each time, grappling more money from the unsuspecting audience,
428140	431520	until they overstep the boundary and we tell them to fuck off.
431520	436920	And right central to that anger at the corporations was the man himself, Mr. Joseph Vargas here.
436920	441740	And this is why Angry Joe's rage is often effective in these situations, he knows exactly
441740	446600	how to direct it, when you're facing off against a mega big bad business, you need
446600	450600	someone who can mobilise the indignation within the viewer, they need someone to rile
450600	454800	up the people, companies like EA, to me at least, have proven themselves as not really
454800	459020	concerned with what the consumer wants, you can't present a reasoned argument to change
459020	463520	their mind, like you could change my mind, they need a different treatment, a firmer
463520	469960	hand, let's consider it tough love, EA, you're receiving my tough love, even though
469960	471600	I positively loathe you.
471600	476580	But anyhow, Angry Joe delivers that, and that's why people felt good about his content, because
476580	480300	it channelled people's feelings in a way that made them feel more inclined to be vocal
480300	482440	about it, it gave them a purpose.
482440	487620	We need people like that who can exert influence, and yes, in many ways it is good on that behalf.
487620	492220	He also has a habit of strawmanning, which once again in a way is fine, there's this
492220	496340	character, Corporate Commander, who is pretty much the satirical strawman on the corporate
496340	500420	mentality, which once again, when dealing with a level of truth, it's perfectly fine
500420	504820	as I've said before, as long as the exaggeration is part of the humour and not placed prior,
504820	508900	then we don't have a problem, and it's clear where it lies in this instance.
508900	514180	When dealing with companies, Angry Joe doesn't pull punches, which is important in a way.
514180	518740	However, when speaking to his fanbase, or even people who aren't necessarily his fans,
518740	523300	if you want to change mentality or behaviour, it can be just a simple case of speaking to
523300	525200	them with a tone of reason.
525200	530200	When dealing with audiences, there'll always be a set of people who are open to persuasion,
530200	533180	and a set of people who won't be so open to persuasion.
533180	536840	Now that can fluctuate depending on what audience you're speaking to, but for me,
536840	540880	it always pays off to be somewhat open to discourse in these scenarios, because even
540880	544820	if you only convince a few people, you know, that's a few people more than none.
544820	548060	With companies, you don't have to do this, mainly because there are a bunch of highly
548060	552860	educated individuals who can probably completely understand the reasoning behind every one
552860	557460	of your points, but choose to ignore it, because it's a free market, they can do what they
557460	559740	want for that sweet, sweet dollar.
559740	564180	With audiences, most of them don't tend to have that agenda, and as I said, this can
564180	568220	change within individual circumstance, but I think that's an important point for everyone
568220	570380	to keep in mind with today's topic.
570380	574700	I will likely have disagreements with people today, it doesn't mean you can't deliver
574700	578300	them in a way that may make them more empathetic to your point of view.
578300	582820	You can throw civility out the window if an individual is just being a dick, or is snidely
582820	587940	attempting to undermine you, those people can fuck off, but I hope I've made my point
587940	588940	clear.
588940	593220	The other thing is that directed anger works sometimes, and not so well other times, and
593220	597020	when dealing with large collectives who may have a variance in ideology, there are some
597020	602340	instances where you could say yes, the ideology is so illogical that it is beyond justification,
602340	604580	but generally, I don't think this is one of them.
604580	609620	So we've essentially dealt with what I believe are two key elements of justified anger, how
609620	612140	rational it is, and who the recipients are.
612140	616120	There are lots of little technicalities within that, but that's why we look at these situations
616120	619140	on a case by case basis, like today.
619140	623340	With the case of businesses being dickheads, Angry Joe was the firebrand game who was going
623340	628560	to stand up to these bad men, it always felt like a David vs Goliath, so even in cases
628560	632820	where the anger may have been overstated, the sheer fact that companies were so huge
632820	636600	just meant that people never felt remotely remorseful for doing it.
636600	641240	There are plenty of psychological studies that have examined how emotional interaction
641240	642240	works.
642240	646620	This sticks out to me, that when dealing with loss in mutual relationships, anger is much
646620	652200	less effective at responding to that than other emotions, I think that's important.
652200	656440	Now today's situation is disjunct from that study, though I do think there are familiar
656440	657440	sentiments.
657440	661400	When you direct anger towards a person for some alleged wrongdoing or disagreement, it
661400	665480	makes them much more likely to be provoked than necessarily be empathetic towards how
665480	669920	you view the situation, which makes them even less likely to being convinced or persuaded,
669920	673080	and more likely to just turn around and say fuck you.
673080	674080	Does that make them right?
674080	675080	No, not at all.
675080	678680	But if there's a better way to make people listen, why wouldn't you choose it?
678680	683440	Angry Joe has built his career off being angry, and galvanising people about affairs that
683440	687140	they might not have cared about otherwise, therefore it's almost likely that a lot
687140	692160	of his fans will be very passionate about topics, and may even demonstrate anger themselves.
692160	696700	I'm not saying that Angry Joe made his fans angry, in fact they may have been passionate
696700	701380	people long before they watched Joe's content, but when they did, his underlying passion
701380	703280	probably resonated in a way.
703280	708840	Your fanbase does tend to reflect you somewhat as a persona, not universally, but at least
708840	709840	partially.
709840	711060	Which leads us to this video.
726700	736000	With the concepts of anger explained, I think we can now apply it to this lovely piece and
736000	738820	explain why people may have taken a decent objection.
738820	742480	Let's quickly discuss the argument before we break down Joe's video.
742480	747000	So basically what I understand from my research, the comments, and the subsequent narratives
747000	752440	is that the inclusion of a female with a prosthetic limb in a game that is depicting a real event
752440	756860	should do it in a historically accurate manner, out of a level of respect for those who may
756860	758740	have sacrificed their lives during the war.
758740	762820	I will of course discuss my viewpoint later on this, but that is the basis.
762820	766620	Now in the intro I branded Angry Joe's video as confusing.
766620	767620	Why is that?
767620	773220	Well you see, the whole anti-SJW and women topic was actually kind of secondary to what
773220	774940	Angry Joe was discussing.
774940	778600	From what I'd heard, I was expecting this rant to be aimed at all the people who were
778600	783420	complaining about there being a female character in the new Battlefield game, but he more used
783420	787660	it as a springboard to explain why in fact the female character wasn't the main reason
787660	789260	that people weren't buying the game.
789260	792700	We'll discuss the credibility of those claims in a moment, but is the fact that it was a
792700	795360	secondary topic good or bad?
795360	799040	Well typically I'd lean towards saying it's a good thing, however in this instance I am
799040	800960	going to make a clear exception.
800960	805140	If it had been a passing comment it probably wouldn't have given the critics enough ammunition,
805140	809480	but he paid just enough amount of time to it to make it worthy of response, while at
809480	814500	the same time using it as a secondary topic meaning that he never actually responded to it,
814500	817280	he just presented it in this exaggerated manner.
817280	822120	In fact if you pay attention he barely provides any commentary on it at all, other than the
822120	826720	impersonations, which is in the sort of typical Angry Joe manner, the sort of exaggerated
826720	832080	character who takes the piss out of a mentality, with a little undertone of fury at those people.
832100	836340	We'll break down any specific details in a moment, but you can see why this probably
836340	838160	didn't come across too well.
838160	843020	You see Joe directed his straw man imitations and attitude partly towards the viewer, not
843020	848100	entirely, he does mention these YouTubers, but he definitely makes some general statements.
848100	852380	Now some of the YouTubers that he watched may have had an agenda to push, but a lot
852380	856620	of audiences are just looking for something to believe in, convictions to have, living
856620	861580	a life without opinion and discourse is very empty, opinions bring people together where
861580	865240	they're in friendship or discourse, and these people look at the arguments whether
865240	869820	from a partisan set of sources or not, and they deliberate what they think is the best
869820	871120	opinion to have.
871120	875280	I think firstly Joe underestimated the amount of people who felt this way, and the sort
875280	877620	of passion that they had about this topic.
877620	882040	Without being too cynical of his intentions, I doubt he would have spoken so disparagingly
882040	886480	of that position if he'd realised the depth of these ideas ran within many of his viewership,
886480	889200	I mean you can tell by the way he words it almost.
891580	921020	Even if you're a strong, passionate person with strong, passionate opinions, no one goes
921020	923300	out to hemorrhage subscribers like that.
923300	927440	But Angry Joe wasn't really that angry in his video, I mean sure he's a naturally
927440	932460	provocative person, but as Ransco it was fairly low key, I mean his attitude didn't help,
932460	937340	but as a secondary topic did it require that level of vitriol, unfortunately that's what
937340	939140	Joe's architecture'd himself.
939140	943480	As I said earlier, when you're a naturally enthusiastic person, you're going to attract
943480	948760	naturally enthusiastic fans, and what happened is that this debate had been going on for
948760	953920	a fair bit of time, if he'd intervened early he may have been able to change some minds,
953920	958880	let alone wrap himself up in all this controversy, but he didn't, he waited for people to re-solidify
958880	963600	their opinions, tell themselves they were right, and then launch this video.
963600	967500	What about the video's points, well Joe expresses that there are different reasons
967500	972100	for why Battlefield's sales are failing, contrary to the people claiming it was the
972100	976280	female main character, and I do understand where he's coming from, I do think there
976280	980700	is probably an array of reasons for the failure in sales of New Battlefield, obviously the
980700	985440	timing and release between one of the most anticipated games in ages might well be a
985440	990480	significant factor, and the idea that it has been marketed terribly is another legitimate
990480	994880	point, I had really only seen one trailer, and it wasn't particularly awe inspiring
994880	999840	as trailers go, however there was a perspective that could've included this that definitely
999840	1005100	seems viable to me, even as someone who seems sceptical of the whole explanation that many
1005100	1008900	others came up with, and this is a point that in my opinion should've been considered,
1008900	1012500	particularly regarding the marketing, when Battlefield 1 had their trailers released
1012500	1016480	in anticipation for the game they had the fact that they were completely changing the
1016480	1022380	style on their side, here was this trailer which was in a way a complete game changer,
1022380	1026380	with all the context, they had a completely different landscape to reflect these ideas
1026380	1030660	on and it was bringing back people to what they wanted, at the same time the presentation
1030660	1035140	of the trailer allowed them to introduce all these new elements individually, exciting
1035140	1038940	the audience while building up to this big fuck off airship.
1038940	1042820	So really when it comes to trailers, the background and the foreground elements are definitely
1042820	1047360	separate in how they can appeal to the viewer, now World War 2 is definitely different from
1047360	1052040	World War 1 in many ways, but stylistically with regards to the background they do bear
1052040	1057500	a set of similarities, so it no longer had the wow factor from Simple Premise, now this
1057500	1062020	in a way wouldn't have affected audience reactions hugely, in fact I'm sure most
1062020	1066020	people wouldn't have minded, but it definitely could've affected sales, on top of this
1066020	1070660	the trailer, despite being a whole minute longer than the Battlefield 1 trailer, just
1070660	1075240	threw a load of things on the screen at once and expected us to take it in, what was actually
1075240	1080040	in the foreground? Well as we've discussed, without having to concede too much it is kind
1080040	1085300	of this lovely lady here, she opens and closes the trailer fairly iconically, and even though
1085300	1090020	there are many components on screen, it's clear that there is a level of focus on her.
1090020	1093940	In my opinion, I don't really care about that, and to get this out of the way just
1093940	1098380	so people understand my position, a lot of history is not particularly intimate to me.
1098380	1102260	Does it interest me? Of course I take great interest in it, but when I go to play games
1102260	1106480	I play it for the fun rather than the historical accuracy, and therefore it doesn't really
1106480	1110960	bother me that they alter details, I mean it's a video game, if you wanted a realistic
1110960	1115600	game about World War 2, it would be slow and depressing. With that said, exaggerating
1115600	1120040	details is definitely different to changing details, and I do understand that for some
1120040	1124460	people, for an experience to be immersive, they take preference to certain elements being
1124460	1130680	accurate over others, and honestly the glamourisation of past events is inescapable to an extent.
1130680	1134480	The next point is discussed under the premise that the inclusion of a female character was
1134480	1138360	used as a marketing tool. Now although not explicitly stated, I feel that from how it
1138360	1141880	was presented, they were trying to bring attention to it. If you feel differently,
1141880	1146080	and that this was just a trailer with a character who happened to be female, then I completely
1146080	1149440	understand that, and this next point will not connect with you.
1149440	1154560	However, as a marketing tool by Battlefield, it is fairly futile. This is not the case
1154560	1160040	of having something groundbreaking, this is not a female Doctor Who, this is a character
1160040	1165800	in a video game. It appears to me that Battlefield either seriously overvalue the cultural impact
1165800	1171400	of their game, or severely misread the demographics. The point is about sales, and let's say
1171400	1174640	people don't care about the female lead. You know what, I agree with that, you know,
1174640	1177800	I don't give a shit, I think most people don't give a shit. Okay, so they have a
1177800	1182800	female lead, great. A lot of video games have female leads, when you play with people like
1182800	1186940	Shell, Athena, or many others, Battlefield doesn't have any rights to declare themselves
1186940	1191500	as a bastion for any causes, they had loads of time to do it before, and they're kind
1191500	1196240	of late to the party, everyone else has gone home. So instead of being lifted up by feminists,
1196240	1200320	they were shot down by historicists, it's hard to feel bad for them when the move seems
1200320	1204980	so bloody calculated. I think that's what stands out to me, it seems phony, and when
1204980	1209640	you have the biggest shill of the company, or the biggest ex-shill of the company, Patrick
1209640	1214820	Soderland, trying to use his daughter as emotional leverage in an interview, yes, I wonder how
1214820	1219380	many of his millions that he's fleeced from the consumer he's decided to donate towards
1219380	1223300	the causes that he suddenly cares about so much. I feel that regardless of whether the
1223300	1228100	sales have been affected by the timing, as a gaming company, you have to introduce something
1228100	1232220	that excites people, and that's what was lacking above all, plenty of games have introduced
1232220	1236700	controversial elements, that have upset people, but they still did relatively well with the
1236700	1241260	sales because they were original, and well thought out, and well marketed. That's what
1241260	1246460	I see with Battlefield, just a failure to capitalise on ideas. So I disagree with people
1246460	1250300	who say that it's the female character that has solely caused the decrease in sales,
1250300	1253820	because at the end of the day, even though many of our YouTube videos may pool some nice
1253820	1259140	views and we have a great set of fans to support us, we don't reach a majority of consumers,
1259140	1263260	many of whom are not concerned with politics, I only heard about gamergate when Angry Joe
1263260	1268260	included it when I was a gamer, we sometimes forget that we're not a central hub, Battlefield
1268260	1272900	1 sold 25 million copies at least, how many of those people are going to be watching us
1272900	1278780	ranting. However, the focus on a female character could definitely be symbolic of that absence
1278780	1285700	of creativity, no one left, right or centre likes a fair weather feminist, it's opportunistic,
1285700	1290100	like businesses are, but moreover than that, it's just bad marketing. So that would be
1290100	1294540	my response to Angry Joe, and also the people that he was responding to. I don't believe
1294540	1298520	in the narrative that it's just female characters impacting the sales, and I'd say that many
1298520	1302620	people do not care, but their focus on it could definitely have taken away from other
1302620	1307700	features that really should be more defining within the game, they're not as revolutionary
1307700	1312900	as they think. What I'm trying to say here is that there is clearly an overlap between
1312900	1317220	viewpoints, and there could have been this bridge built between understanding, and it
1317220	1322500	may have even convinced some people away from the narrative being created by a lot of these
1322500	1327220	other commentators that Angry Joe clearly feels are in the wrong, but he's instead
1327220	1332380	decided to completely castigate them, at the same time castigating the audiences, and
1332380	1336900	this is what really annoys me about the community in general, so let's discuss it a bit more.
1340260	1345700	I responded to the narrative that Joe responded to, I did not have to even address whether
1345700	1349920	I thought they should have females in the game or not, in fact, the only reason I did
1349920	1354180	was just so people could see my opinion, and maybe it would change a few minds, I don't
1354180	1357900	know, people may have their mind made up already. Angry Joe almost seemed to go out
1357900	1362540	of his way to make a jab at the critics of the inclusion of a female character in the
1362540	1367440	game, even though he didn't need to, which is weird because he then makes a second video
1367440	1371220	which is a response to another video, in which he says that people are annoyed because he
1371220	1373060	presented a different idea.
1373060	1400860	And that's the thing.
1400860	1407160	I don't think the ideas that Angry Joe was trying to speak about were particularly bad,
1407160	1411340	it was just the tone that fired back on you, because in those instances, it doesn't matter
1411340	1415900	how valid your point is, if you have no respect to the people you present it to, then they're
1415900	1420880	not going to hear you out. For the record, I do not think Joe is a shill, Joe doesn't
1420880	1425660	seem to be defending any company conduct here, it's just impossible to work out who he
1425660	1430480	planned to respond to when he behaved with such hostility towards them. Let me present
1430480	1434880	to you a hypothetical scenario, and one that should serve as a base assumption in many
1434880	1439520	instances, at least in my opinion at least. You have a commentator, and he doesn't like
1439520	1443880	you, he's saying to all his fans, this is the truth, listen to me, do not listen to
1443880	1450240	them, they're wrong. These fans may be convinced, as I said, it's on a spectrum, how do you
1450240	1456120	respond? And when I say how, how do you speak to the fans? In this instance, Angry Joe doesn't
1456120	1460640	seem to understand that people, whether they're right or wrong in the way they feel, aren't
1460640	1464840	going to listen to him. It'd be like me, instead of starting off my video like I did
1464840	1467600	today, I would instead be going like this.
1467600	1474320	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the best opinion, where I show why you're
1474320	1479480	wrong. And today we've got Angry Joe, this ugly bellend who looks like he's the front
1479480	1485160	runner for 2018's Virgin of the Year, and today we have him trying to talk about video
1485200	1490120	games like he even cares about them, how adorable. We don't really want him in the community,
1490120	1494520	we just tolerate him, and when he's not rambling on about boring theories that no
1494520	1499820	one gives a shit about, he's attacking gamers, the ones he's supposed to be standing up
1499820	1505980	for, talking about how they're all sexist man pigs, yeah screw you buddy. Now he obviously
1505980	1510640	has received this treatment from many people, and I disagree with it firmly, and it just
1510640	1515600	shows how individuals value riling people up over actually trying to change their mind.
1515600	1519760	But this does not make Joe's point of view inexcusable, it just means that he's sunk
1519760	1523880	to their level. I feel Joe probably witnessed the backlash to the inclusion of a female
1523880	1528120	character in this scenario, and thought to himself this is all rather unjustified. People
1528120	1533160	were becoming riled up, he even says that himself, he probably had his reasons for thinking
1533160	1537560	that way. I also feel that it isn't necessarily worth the vitriol, and honestly I think there
1537560	1540920	are decent responses that can be made to the claims.
1540920	1544600	But I feel like these sorts of topics that people are trying to have discussions with
1544600	1549400	have gone to such shit of recent, and it was a trap that Joe just fell in. Which is why
1549400	1553120	I typed with this part preaching to the choir, because the sort of tone that's presented
1553120	1557980	is exactly what people who agree with whatever youtuber want to hear. They wanna hear something
1557980	1562280	to be pissed off, and then the person is pissed off and they respond in a pissed off manner,
1562280	1566320	and audiences on the two sides are never really interested in the context, they just wanna
1566320	1570080	hear the person they hate get dunked on by the person they like.
1570080	1574120	By buying into that demean himself, Joe probably does make some friends in certain places,
1574120	1579000	but is unlikely to change minds, which is really what I think discourse should be about.
1579000	1583040	Now once again, this is no pass to some of the people who made responses to him, they
1583040	1587680	were clearly lacking interest in convincing him, and more in stoking the fire, but they'll
1587680	1592300	have their time very soon. From my somewhat extensive experience, Joe likes to present
1592300	1597500	himself as an arbiter of the community and consumerism, and in a way he always has, and
1597500	1602180	by making these videos about top 10 controversies and providing his opinions on it, it tells
1602180	1606120	me that he's someone who really does want to cover these sensitive topics with nuance,
1606120	1610060	and gain respect from those in the community. I think the problem is he became a poster
1610060	1615160	child for what many of his critics wanted to make him out to be, in the battle of ideologies
1615160	1619580	things are so much more about presentation than they are about points, and I think he'll
1619580	1624660	regret how he spoke, because he's got himself caught up in the trap. When really his video
1624660	1629460	had some points that could have shifted perspective, everything got drawn to his assigned comments,
1629460	1634300	which weren't really necessary in the first place. Maybe that's his persona, maybe that's
1634300	1638420	what he wants, but I don't think it is, I think a series of choices in how he has
1638420	1643420	conducted himself led to this. He has attracted fans from all over the field with his firebrand
1643420	1648460	rhetoric and clear cut consumer values, but if he directs that attitude at those people
1648460	1652420	they're likely to respond in the same sort of tone, and also compose the narrative that
1652420	1656460	he doesn't stand for those very values that brought them there in the first place. I don't
1656460	1661020	believe he's not pro-consumer just for disagreeing with people's points of view on this topic,
1661020	1666100	it's not really corporatist-centric, I just hope that today this has been a more relaxed
1666100	1671620	view on the whole thing after it's all quietened down a bit. I think Joe is legitimately one
1671620	1676740	of the good guys, but unfortunately everything past has led to this presence, and he has
1676740	1681700	provoked part of it unto himself in this instance, and maybe in spite of the anger,
1681700	1683620	take some of my points on board.
1683620	1688540	Anyhow, that was the video, yes great fun, and we had a great time doing this one, as
1688540	1693460	I said duvet over my head, this is America, what joy.
1693460	1698300	However if my predictions are right, we probably have passed 50,000 by now so I really wanna
1698300	1703860	thank everyone for that, obviously I'll probably put out a tweet and YouTube comment too, but
1703860	1708500	let's make it official YouTube, thanks guys for all the support, it means a lot, 50k would
1708500	1713260	not be possible without these blokes, the editors, they have done once again a stellar
1713260	1718620	job of creating another masterpiece, and I cannot thank them enough. Go and send them
1718620	1721020	some love because they really, really deserve it.
1721020	1726580	If you wanna reach me, and I'm not responding to comments, my Twitter's at the right opinion,
1726580	1732580	Facebook as well, sometimes use that, links in the pinned comment, you're gonna love them.
1732580	1736300	I also have a Discord, which I have been a bit more active in recently, I told you
1736300	1741940	guys I'd pick it up, mainly text chat though, but you can still reach me on my account there
1741940	1744740	too, I try and keep everything open for those purposes.
1744740	1748500	Anyhow, I don't think I really have too much else to say, hopefully this audio sounds better
1748500	1753340	than my last one, or else I've just overheated myself for like 50 minutes, well I'm gonna
1753340	1756140	put my headphones on soon and find out.
1756140	1759980	Until then however, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
1762580	1766580	Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
