00:00.000 --> 00:08.960
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:08.960 --> 00:13.460
too much free time, and, oh boy, have we got a lot to unbox today.

00:13.460 --> 00:17.080
In case anyone isn't aware, I'm a man of music, I have reviewed music on this channel,

00:17.080 --> 00:20.300
I've covered various controversies with regards to music, I've talked about provocative

00:20.300 --> 00:23.640
content and it creates probably some of my most polarising content.

00:23.640 --> 00:26.820
I'm also a trained singer-songwriter and I guarantee you when I get the chance The

00:26.820 --> 00:30.700
Right Opinion is dropping a fucking fire album that blows all of these hoes out of

00:30.700 --> 00:31.700
the water.

00:31.700 --> 00:34.580
But that's besides the point, I've realised that now I'm doing longer content that it's

00:34.580 --> 00:38.240
not going to be so easy to just chuck out my opinions on music, and often given the

00:38.240 --> 00:42.140
length of the song, it's hard to talk in the mini-documentary styles that I do, but

00:42.140 --> 00:45.820
that won't stop me from trying, and every now and then an absolute sitter comes in and

00:45.820 --> 00:47.580
I have to take a swing.

00:47.580 --> 00:51.620
Enter stage left Nicole Arbour, the comedian slash YouTube personality, has caused a fair

00:51.620 --> 00:53.660
bit of commotion throughout her career.

00:53.660 --> 00:58.340
Famously in 2015 she decided to release a video known as Dear Fat People, in which she

00:58.340 --> 01:02.500
criticised obese individuals for their excessive weight and told them to lose it in quite a

01:02.500 --> 01:03.500
crude manner.

01:03.500 --> 01:22.020
A lot of people took offence to the blunt way that she attacked others, and yes it is

01:22.020 --> 01:26.600
rather provocative, and revisiting it in preparation for this video, in all honesty, the only thing

01:26.600 --> 01:29.540
I actually found offensive was how unfunny it was.

01:29.540 --> 01:33.220
Now I accept comedy as subjective, but it was all this distraction comedy with no real

01:33.220 --> 01:34.220
punchline to me.

01:34.220 --> 01:37.680
But yeah, that regardless I can understand why people were annoyed by it, and in true

01:37.680 --> 01:41.360
controversial fashion she released a part too, I assume because she had so much more

01:41.360 --> 01:45.000
to develop from the first one, but it had been a couple years and she had ducked down

01:45.000 --> 01:47.900
to the public eye, I certainly wasn't thinking about her.

01:47.900 --> 01:52.060
As a stage right, Donald Glover aka Childish Gambino, the jack of all trades, has been

01:52.060 --> 01:56.120
praised for his work all over the spectrum of media from script writing to music production,

01:56.120 --> 01:59.860
I have to give him props for that, I respect that grind, but realising that he had yet

01:59.860 --> 02:03.720
to make a vociferous political statement, he decided that why not infuse that with his

02:03.720 --> 02:06.300
natural talents, and brought us This is America.

02:06.300 --> 02:10.660
The meticulously crafted creation impressed me on both a technical level and an interpretive

02:10.660 --> 02:11.660
level.

02:11.660 --> 02:15.220
As someone who really does enjoy artistry, I cannot express how much I appreciate the

02:15.220 --> 02:19.240
detail of the subtext and imagery, too many artists just don't appreciate how much more

02:19.240 --> 02:21.060
potent it can make your content.

02:21.060 --> 02:24.900
I think that part of the appeal is the multitude of interpretations, and I'm glad that people

02:24.900 --> 02:28.860
are discussing it, and hopefully it will inspire more profound conversation.

02:28.860 --> 02:33.480
But nothing is sacred, and Nicole Arbour saw a chance to give it her own spin, well not

02:33.480 --> 02:37.920
necessarily her own personal spin, but a women's spin, one from women's rights and highlighting

02:37.920 --> 02:40.620
their maltreatment in modern American society.

02:40.620 --> 02:41.620
How brave.

02:41.780 --> 02:45.060
Now if you aren't familiar with me and the title of this video, you will be bracing

02:45.060 --> 02:48.840
to what is an inevitable amount of criticism that is about to be thrown her way.

02:48.840 --> 02:53.140
My opinion is that this is bad, very bad, I'd heard she'd responded to some of the

02:53.140 --> 02:56.580
criticism, and when I read it she really did make a compelling case for her content.

02:56.580 --> 03:00.620
And then I went and watched it again and reminded myself that actually it was pretty bad, and

03:00.620 --> 03:01.620
it did deserve this video.

03:01.620 --> 03:05.700
Due to the backlash she has subsequently disabled ratings and comments, but it wasn't well

03:05.700 --> 03:09.380
received to say the least at first, with many people claiming she had completely butchered

03:09.380 --> 03:10.700
what the original stood for.

03:10.700 --> 03:14.660
How many have criticised her as making a cynical cash-in, riding on the coattails of something

03:14.660 --> 03:15.660
so much better.

03:15.660 --> 03:19.620
But I'm going to go into this video with an optimistic outlook of her character, the

03:19.620 --> 03:23.980
right opinion is a pure heart, he believes in benefit of the doubt.

03:23.980 --> 03:25.460
What a merciful soul I am.

03:25.460 --> 03:29.000
I think the fact that she's white doesn't really undermine the message necessarily,

03:29.000 --> 03:32.460
the validity of the statements about general issues are not dependent on who is saying

03:32.460 --> 03:36.540
it, only statements about personal experience might be able to be judged on such a merit.

03:36.540 --> 03:41.060
Though I have to say, I do find it quite weird out of everyone to make such a unique

03:41.060 --> 03:45.180
commentary on the female American experience, it was a Canadian.

03:45.180 --> 03:49.180
And let me make this clear, I think anyone can talk about politics from foreign countries,

03:49.180 --> 03:53.780
I talk about American politics all the time, but this is so identifiably quintessentially

03:53.780 --> 03:57.860
American, it seems exceptionally strange for her to come and speak about it herself.

03:57.860 --> 04:02.260
However, as we will soon find out, Arbors version isn't really that American.

04:02.260 --> 04:06.160
You are obviously going to be compared on many levels to the original, especially if

04:06.160 --> 04:10.300
you try and draw parallels, which is what Nicole Arber attempts to do, so you better

04:10.300 --> 04:13.520
make sure yours at least bangs, right?

04:13.520 --> 04:14.520
Right.

04:14.520 --> 04:18.000
I know a lot of people have memed it and laughed at it, and I've done that as well, a majority

04:18.000 --> 04:22.100
of people do agree that it's pretty bad, but no one's tied down the little details that

04:22.100 --> 04:26.280
in my opinion make it much more egregious than the mediocre offerings often presented

04:26.280 --> 04:28.000
to us within musical wokeness.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.200
I hope that today's video will not just provide a comprehensive criticism of the individual

04:32.200 --> 04:36.400
question but also give some valuable lessons that everyone can take something away from

04:36.400 --> 04:37.840
in critical thinking.

04:37.840 --> 04:42.480
So today I'm going to be explaining my problems with Nicole Arber's musical magnum opus that

04:42.480 --> 04:47.120
is known as This is America Women's Edit, and boy are you in for a treat.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.280
Without further ado, let's get to it.

04:49.280 --> 04:53.760
Let's discuss the premise, now when your video is titled This is America, what is the first

04:53.760 --> 04:55.120
thing that comes to mind?

04:55.120 --> 04:56.800
That this is America.

04:56.800 --> 04:59.760
This video is going to be documenting the struggles that will make someone think of

04:59.760 --> 05:00.760
that message.

05:00.760 --> 05:04.280
Now in this instance, with regards to the original title, Childish Gambino made it quite

05:04.280 --> 05:07.440
clear that there was a level of exclusivity to his statements.

05:07.440 --> 05:11.880
With all these various coinciding messages, it created an image of something very specific

05:11.880 --> 05:17.080
to America, maybe even being able to specify it to a specific indictment of media-driven

05:17.080 --> 05:21.960
fantasy within America, and their relationship with the deeply impoverished reality of many

05:21.960 --> 05:27.600
of its citizens, a juxtaposition whose magnitude is arguably very unique to the US.

05:27.600 --> 05:31.200
But anyone who does copy the message has to at least use that template.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.320
What do we get with Nicole Arber?

05:33.320 --> 05:36.920
Well a string of messages that don't really come together at all, especially with regards

05:36.920 --> 05:37.920
to America.

05:37.920 --> 05:42.080
Let's try to break this down, now it's important to note that Nicole Arber clarifies the target

05:42.080 --> 05:46.620
of the video as North America, to try and sidestep the inevitable criticism that she's

05:46.620 --> 05:49.280
not from the states, and we'll address this response later.

05:49.280 --> 05:50.440
So where can we start?

05:50.440 --> 05:55.320
A high majority of the problems listed off by Nicole Arber are America, but there are

05:55.320 --> 05:58.900
also a multitude of other countries across the world, so immediately the statement, this

05:58.900 --> 06:01.480
is America, does not hold the same weight.

06:01.480 --> 06:04.440
Let's break down some of the original messages, and have a gander.

06:04.440 --> 06:08.320
She wrote a little Instagram post where she listed off all the topics that she was trying

06:08.320 --> 06:09.320
to touch on.

06:09.320 --> 06:12.420
I wanted to knock two on the head fairly immediately, the shaming of breastfeeding, I assume she

06:12.420 --> 06:14.800
means public breastfeeding, and the gender pay gap.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.680
Okay let's say these are problems, are they really America?

06:17.680 --> 06:21.360
The stigma around breastfeeding exists throughout the world, and the gender pay gap is a very

06:21.360 --> 06:25.120
complex question, and people haven't solved it not because they're not aware of it, but

06:25.120 --> 06:28.600
because people don't agree on how to solve it, or even whether it needs to be solved

06:28.600 --> 06:29.600
or not.

06:29.600 --> 06:33.960
Bruce Hornsby did a song in 1987 called The Way It Is, smash hit, incredible piano work,

06:33.960 --> 06:37.280
but it was also a statement about civil rights, and in it he makes the statement that although

06:37.280 --> 06:42.100
civil rights laws have been established, some people will be racist and prejudice nonetheless,

06:42.100 --> 06:46.080
because the law doesn't change in their minds, and that it is something that we should challenge

06:46.080 --> 06:50.160
without a doubt, but it's a slow process, but the reason we haven't circumvented it

06:50.160 --> 06:53.760
isn't because we don't know it exists, we completely get it.

06:53.760 --> 06:57.780
With issues like this, if discrimination exists, the fact that both the rights of breastfeeding

06:57.780 --> 07:01.340
and equal pay are protected by legislation makes the problem more difficult than just

07:01.340 --> 07:02.340
noticing it.

07:02.340 --> 07:05.760
You can't actively discriminate on the basis of gender, and you're allowed to publicly

07:05.760 --> 07:09.840
breastfeed apart from in Idaho, so if you want to make a point about Idaho, then go

07:09.840 --> 07:10.840
for it.

07:10.840 --> 07:14.100
But for some reason, I don't think this is an open attack on Idaho.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.360
Legislation isn't the problem necessarily, it's a mentality, it's the fact that some

07:17.360 --> 07:18.920
people are still judgemental.

07:18.920 --> 07:22.680
Now if you want to argue with them, then more power to you, but observing that it exists

07:22.680 --> 07:26.560
is not an argument in itself, it'd be like me saying racism exists.

07:26.560 --> 07:28.680
Okay, where's my fucking Nobel Peace Prize?

07:28.680 --> 07:32.920
We've passed that stage Nicole, people have already developed their arguments on these

07:32.920 --> 07:35.040
topics, you're decades behind.

07:35.040 --> 07:40.360
And besides that, as I said, this is not just America, this is a multitude of cultures including

07:40.360 --> 07:44.260
America, and yes, I know she included a specific case about cheerleaders, but that's almost

07:44.260 --> 07:48.240
a red herring in a way, it's providing a specific example and therefore concluding

07:48.240 --> 07:51.840
that the problem itself must be specific, which isn't the case, the problem will yield

07:51.840 --> 07:55.880
many specific examples all over the world, but that does not undermine its generality.

07:55.880 --> 07:59.800
Let's talk about sexual assault and harassment, two other topics that she touches on.

07:59.800 --> 08:02.600
It would be crass to lump them in with the other two topics I just mentioned because

08:02.600 --> 08:06.040
although they're also legislated against, they're a different type of issue, a much

08:06.040 --> 08:07.360
more serious one.

08:07.360 --> 08:10.260
Sexual harassment and assault are definitely women's issues, and we should definitely

08:10.260 --> 08:14.460
be working to stem those issues, but once again, it's not necessarily a cultural phenomenon

08:14.460 --> 08:16.560
and reports have been on the decline.

08:16.560 --> 08:20.360
Criminal activity will always exist, it's just unfortunately given the matrices of power

08:20.360 --> 08:24.720
passed on successive societies, the crimes are slanted against women in those subjects,

08:24.720 --> 08:27.480
just like a majority of other crimes are slanted against men.

08:27.480 --> 08:31.480
We shouldn't accept it by any means, but it's not stimulated solely in America.

08:31.480 --> 08:35.280
Now at this point, some may argue that this is a point against a lot of childish Gambino's

08:35.280 --> 08:39.680
points, and although not entirely incorrect, Gambino appears to be outlining an environment

08:39.680 --> 08:43.680
that has cultivated the current predicament, and each individual general problem crafts

08:43.680 --> 08:47.960
an individual image that is fairly specific to America, with its hysterical media almost

08:47.960 --> 08:52.040
acting as a source of supernormal stimuli, detracting from the disturbing truth.

08:52.040 --> 08:56.360
It is central to every problem that Gambino crafts, creating an image that although affecting

08:56.360 --> 08:59.440
a general population, is very specific in its framework.

08:59.440 --> 09:03.440
Arber seems to assort a load of problems, but none of them seem to go together to create

09:03.440 --> 09:07.420
anything particularly coherent other than a collection of observations linked by the

09:07.420 --> 09:09.280
fact that they're primarily women's issues.

09:09.280 --> 09:13.920
And that's in part why message-wise, it fails so badly, not because she's necessarily white,

09:13.920 --> 09:16.820
that's a lazy cop-out and it's allowed her to actually defend it.

09:16.820 --> 09:20.680
It fails as an interpretation because it tries to parallel the message and fails.

09:20.680 --> 09:21.820
Let me expand.

09:21.820 --> 09:25.900
Why does West Side Story as an interpretation of Romeo and Juliet work?

09:25.900 --> 09:29.720
Because it touches on the key elemental plot points that Romeo and Juliet set up and therefore

09:29.720 --> 09:31.840
made it identifiable with the source material.

09:31.840 --> 09:35.580
If it hadn't, it wouldn't have been an interpretation, it would have just been its own piece.

09:35.580 --> 09:38.980
And that wouldn't have necessarily been a bad thing, but the worst possible combination

09:38.980 --> 09:43.100
is when you so blatantly try to mirror the original by ripping the beat, the key hooks

09:43.100 --> 09:47.500
and the phrases to the point of mimicry and yet in everything you change, you fail.

09:47.500 --> 09:52.400
That's what Nicole Arber's done in the most atrocious, borderline insulting way possible.

09:52.400 --> 09:56.140
That's not saying that you can't integrate source material into crafting a different

09:56.140 --> 09:57.140
message.

09:57.140 --> 09:58.140
Plenty of artists have done that.

09:58.140 --> 10:01.980
Stan and Eminem sampling Dido's Thank You is an excellent example, but that worked because

10:01.980 --> 10:03.580
it was totally consistent.

10:03.580 --> 10:07.660
In this instance, the context provided with the original just shows up Arber's cover in

10:07.660 --> 10:09.540
an even more embarrassing way.

10:09.540 --> 10:14.460
When Charles Gambino crafts this greater message about social media, it is essential

10:14.460 --> 10:17.780
to the song, to the point where if you removed it, the other messages from the song wouldn't

10:17.780 --> 10:18.780
make sense.

10:18.780 --> 10:24.100
Arber, yeah, she does mention social media, in her own words, social media on modern relationships

10:24.100 --> 10:25.100
and self.

10:25.100 --> 10:28.740
Now, if we are to try and unpack that vagueness in comparison, we can assume that with the

10:28.740 --> 10:33.360
subtle symbolism, wink fucking wink, in the video that she is referring to the culture

10:33.360 --> 10:37.700
of vanity and self-consciousness that seems more prevalent with females on social media,

10:37.700 --> 10:40.820
perpetuated through unrealistic beauty standards.

10:40.820 --> 10:44.260
With regards to social media on relationships, there isn't much to see in the video, although

10:44.260 --> 10:47.820
I assume the handing out of hearts following the wedding is how relationships have evolved

10:47.820 --> 10:51.660
from families to women seeking confirmation through guys and their social media hearts

10:51.660 --> 10:52.940
rather than actual love.

10:52.940 --> 10:56.300
You know the sort of thing that Hollywood thought it was trendy to point out in like

10:56.300 --> 10:57.300
2010?

10:57.300 --> 11:00.620
If I removed these two messages, nothing would change about the video.

11:00.620 --> 11:01.620
They're not integral.

11:01.620 --> 11:06.640
This is some of the most derivative, box-ticking activism in the face of one of the most multifaceted

11:06.640 --> 11:11.960
artistic statements in a while, and its vapid, surface-level approach to the messages is

11:11.960 --> 11:13.680
so transparent.

11:13.680 --> 11:15.520
So, so transparent.

11:15.520 --> 11:20.480
And now I wanted to talk about two other topics, which is apparently the labels and the pressures.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.480
And yes, you know what?

11:21.480 --> 11:25.960
It is a shame that society is judgmental sometimes, but it's so common you've probably done it

11:25.960 --> 11:27.640
a fair few times yourself.

11:27.640 --> 11:30.960
You ever look at a fat person and think, boy, why didn't they just lose some weight?

11:30.960 --> 11:32.360
There's nothing stopping them.

11:32.360 --> 11:35.440
Oh, wait, yes you did, and made a two-part series on it.

11:35.440 --> 11:36.540
Why do we do that?

11:36.540 --> 11:37.800
It's called heuristics.

11:37.800 --> 11:42.120
We create certain stereotypes of characteristics that make it easier for us to judge people.

11:42.120 --> 11:46.200
They're flawed mechanisms, but a lot of people use them nonetheless.

11:46.200 --> 11:50.420
This was also addressed in a song called Follow Your Arrow by Kacey Musgraves a few years

11:50.420 --> 11:51.420
ago.

11:51.420 --> 11:55.040
An infinitely better song, which is much nicer on the ears as well, and it deals with the

11:55.040 --> 11:59.980
issues of a judgmental society in a more compact, listenable, and nuanced way.

11:59.980 --> 12:03.860
The issue is, as Musgraves points out, that most of us are going to be regularly exposed

12:03.860 --> 12:07.960
to heuristics and stereotypes of what people think we're like, and yet in the chorus

12:07.960 --> 12:11.640
she declares that you might as well just do whatever the fuck you want and do your best

12:11.640 --> 12:14.240
to work with it, because people are always going to judge.

12:14.240 --> 12:17.760
Now there are definitely gender-based judgments, but whether they're really slanted one way

12:17.760 --> 12:19.080
that much is questionable.

12:19.080 --> 12:22.920
Equality in this instance is a nice idea, but the only real equality you'll get between

12:22.920 --> 12:26.640
demographics is when those within the demographics are equally as judgmental.

12:26.640 --> 12:29.880
You'll never really eradicate it, but if you want to try, you should probably start to

12:29.880 --> 12:31.280
practice what you preach.

12:31.280 --> 12:34.220
You've already noticed that throughout this section I've chucked in various references

12:34.220 --> 12:36.940
to other, and in my opinion, better music and art.

12:36.940 --> 12:38.940
That's because there is nothing inspired here.

12:38.940 --> 12:42.740
It's rehashed old content that would have been dated in its message a decade ago.

12:42.740 --> 12:46.100
There are numerous artists who've dealt with this in a much more mature way and don't have

12:46.100 --> 12:50.060
to fuck up another song in the process, and in doing so completely skewed its own message

12:50.060 --> 12:53.880
because it failed to understand how connected the messages of the original were.

12:53.880 --> 12:57.320
She couldn't even interpret it to make it culturally specific about the United States

12:57.320 --> 12:58.320
of America.

12:58.320 --> 13:01.940
Now if I was in this video rapping, we'll say North America, but none of this is remotely

13:01.940 --> 13:04.300
unique from any South American country either.

13:04.300 --> 13:07.740
You think they don't have literally every problem you've listed here in South America?

13:07.740 --> 13:12.100
And if you tried this dirty to create an all-American image, a lot of Gambino's messages standalone

13:12.100 --> 13:16.100
do not amount to specific scenarios, but the way he created a subtext that molded them

13:16.100 --> 13:20.580
together makes the final image a lot more identifiable with the thesis statement.

13:20.580 --> 13:24.620
That is not present in Arbor's version, and there is a lot to be said in its musical failures,

13:24.620 --> 13:26.740
which is where we are fucking going next.

13:27.600 --> 13:31.960
As I pointed out earlier, Arbor's song fails as an interpretation because she takes so

13:31.960 --> 13:36.560
many of the devices used in the original but also tries to substitute elements that created

13:36.560 --> 13:38.400
this incoherent mess.

13:38.400 --> 13:42.480
But let's try to break down the specifics that aid the creation of such a failure, and

13:42.480 --> 13:46.920
on a technical level where the flaws really come to showing why Nicole should maybe have

13:46.920 --> 13:48.920
given this endeavor a break.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.920
Let's compare the interpretation with the original.

13:50.920 --> 13:55.800
One of the largest flaws in Nicole's version is that she relies on text over subtext.

13:55.820 --> 14:00.740
A lot of what Childish Gambino's work focused on was that a very high majority of the lyrics

14:00.740 --> 14:05.060
would not be out of place on any brag rap song, and therefore by contrasting them with

14:05.060 --> 14:09.860
the grim reality of the connotations, it allows the message to be conveyed quite smartly.

14:09.860 --> 14:14.580
Nicole rips many lines from Gambino's original, and therefore you'd need it to be consistent

14:14.580 --> 14:16.700
with the balance of text to subtext.

14:16.700 --> 14:21.700
However, a lot of the changes she makes tend to push towards surface-level text.

14:21.700 --> 14:26.240
A really simple example of how it doesn't work is the switching of slipping for climbing

14:26.240 --> 14:27.440
in the chorus.

14:27.440 --> 14:31.540
In Gambino's song the line, Don't Catch You Slipping Now has an urgency of how an

14:31.540 --> 14:33.880
individual may want to watch themselves.

14:33.880 --> 14:38.720
One wrong move could cause dangerous repercussions, but the delivery almost revels in it.

14:38.720 --> 14:42.720
Many rappers enjoy invoking the idea of fear over their enemies.

14:42.720 --> 14:46.960
ABBA users don't catch you climbing up, as a statement about women's lack of social

14:46.960 --> 14:50.860
mobility, but the issue there is that there is no subtext, people don't glorify the

14:50.860 --> 14:51.860
glass ceiling.

14:51.860 --> 14:57.240
Okay, so she changes it a bit, not a huge problem until you try to mimic the subtext.

14:57.240 --> 15:01.480
In the original Gambino uses multiple lines with a lot of subtext, one example I could

15:01.480 --> 15:06.200
extract is The Police Be Tripping Now, which to me is used to demonstrate how rappers often

15:06.200 --> 15:09.820
mock the problems that don't affect them anymore, despite them purportedly remaining

15:09.820 --> 15:12.120
prevalent within their former societies.

15:12.120 --> 15:15.060
Nicole ABBA switches this and says The Boys Be Tripping Now.

15:15.060 --> 15:18.960
Now firstly, in this moment it's already hard to identify subtext because many of the

15:18.960 --> 15:23.620
issues she identifies in her Instagram don't necessarily go away with success, but it also

15:23.620 --> 15:26.420
creates a very confusing contextual narrative.

15:26.420 --> 15:31.340
Whereas Childish Gambino's rap portrays an unsettlingly ignorant caricature, Nicole

15:31.340 --> 15:35.780
ABBA's characters regularly switches back and forth between Childish Gambino-esque mimicry

15:35.780 --> 15:39.540
and just another activist pointing out these problems within society, at one point she

15:39.540 --> 15:43.340
literally responds to her own observation going, what the fuck?

15:43.340 --> 15:47.100
Creating this completely inconsistent narrative which is impossible to follow, it's really

15:47.100 --> 15:50.680
fucking sloppy on a technical level, which even if what she was trying to say was new

15:50.680 --> 15:54.360
or provocative, she'd have lost it in the delivery because she tried to nab certain

15:54.360 --> 15:59.120
themes and abandon others, not realising that they were all complimentary to each other,

15:59.120 --> 16:01.840
and as soon as you desert that, you end up with this.

16:01.840 --> 16:04.000
What else can be said about this then?

16:04.000 --> 16:07.020
Well, ABBA doesn't necessarily quite nail the delivery either.

16:07.020 --> 16:11.000
In Gambino's the rapper recites his verses coldly with a very deadpan delivery which

16:11.000 --> 16:15.480
often played contrast to his very flamboyant choreography, ABBA on the other hand is vocally

16:15.480 --> 16:19.620
all over the place and I am aware that she is known for her exuberant performances but

16:19.620 --> 16:23.640
by having such a hammy vocal delivery, it undermines whatever message was attempting

16:23.640 --> 16:24.640
to be made.

16:24.640 --> 16:28.480
She claims that the tone is tongue in cheek on her Instagram and maybe that would explain

16:28.480 --> 16:31.900
the vocals but the issue is that it doesn't match anything else that she is trying to

16:31.900 --> 16:36.860
do, changing your voice does not enhance the song, in fact the art of tongue in cheek content

16:36.860 --> 16:41.260
often requires some maintenance of the tone of the original, while creating surreal different

16:41.260 --> 16:45.920
scenarios for that grounded tone to remain, rather than vice versa, and it certainly doesn't

16:45.920 --> 16:48.480
work over something as dark as this.

16:48.480 --> 16:52.280
Her singing vocals slapped all over the musical interludes are not done very well either,

16:52.280 --> 16:56.240
Gambino's have clearly been very carefully placed with regards to the instrumentation,

16:56.240 --> 16:59.580
the opening set of vocals are particularly well mixed, with the lyrics just creeping

16:59.580 --> 17:03.520
through but drowned out in a sinister mix, it really creates this haunting atmosphere,

17:03.520 --> 17:07.620
in ABBA's it just sounds like she's had a few too many vodkas before the studio session.

17:07.620 --> 17:11.620
The instrumental has also been awkwardly changed, for some reason the dentist drill

17:11.620 --> 17:15.920
synth is slathered on the top of the mix and it sounds extremely irritating, and for some

17:15.920 --> 17:19.440
reason they've moved the propulsive bass line to the back of the mix, it honestly seems

17:19.440 --> 17:23.320
like the producer hated this song as much as I do because anyone making those production

17:23.320 --> 17:27.440
decisions did not do them out of love for this concoction, and yet all of these hail

17:27.440 --> 17:30.920
in comparison to the last minute and a half of this song which is just awful, firstly

17:30.920 --> 17:39.880
she says this, which is just diabolical, considering the context of the song and on

17:39.880 --> 17:43.500
a technical level alone, she then proceeds to make a clumsily delivered line about the

17:43.500 --> 17:47.240
Taliban before taking a moment to actually explain the reference, which is not something

17:47.240 --> 17:51.980
you as an artist should ever do in the song unless it's to purposefully convey awkwardness,

17:51.980 --> 17:55.460
which it doesn't, it just seems like she's worried that people may think it's a bad

17:55.460 --> 17:56.860
line, which it is.

17:56.860 --> 18:01.160
Then she does a tap dance, which I assume is her tongue in cheek interpretation of that

18:01.160 --> 18:06.160
quirky childish Gambino moment, before following this with an outro reflecting Gambino's

18:06.160 --> 18:10.080
video, the video finishes with the quote, if I were a guy, you wouldn't be asking

18:10.080 --> 18:14.000
yourself, I wonder who wrote that, but I think we can say with a decent amount of confidence

18:14.000 --> 18:17.720
that Nicole Arbour definitely wrote that, because heaven knows who else would consciously

18:17.720 --> 18:20.600
attach their name to such a messy statement.

18:20.600 --> 18:24.840
I'm being harsh, but this all comes across to me as incredibly lazy, hamfisted, and lacking

18:24.840 --> 18:27.220
any sort of real investment from its performer.

18:27.220 --> 18:31.100
Although I do concur with a lot of the original source material, I don't agree with every

18:31.100 --> 18:35.000
single measure that I have derived from it, and I wouldn't expect to, but I do have

18:35.000 --> 18:39.740
a hell of a lot of respect with how it works as an artistic statement, Arbour has no grip

18:39.740 --> 18:40.740
of that.

18:40.740 --> 18:44.300
Her content doesn't work as satire because the messages hold no weight and the humour

18:44.300 --> 18:48.220
is dead, it doesn't work as a social statement because there is nothing more than observations

18:48.220 --> 18:52.260
of problems that don't even tie into the supposed overarching narrative, it doesn't

18:52.260 --> 18:55.880
work as a musical piece because the music isn't original and nowhere near as well

18:55.880 --> 19:00.080
mixed as the original, and when you have so many other musicians making better crafted

19:00.080 --> 19:04.600
social statements, why would you ever choose someone who basically uses a quote good cause

19:04.600 --> 19:06.000
as a shield to make this?

19:06.000 --> 19:10.060
And unfortunately, that's what a lot of people do, a lot of people think that marching

19:10.060 --> 19:14.720
under a banner of righteousness will somehow alleviate criticism, but it should not, and

19:14.720 --> 19:18.600
it won't round here, and I'm kind of relieved that of all people Nicole Arbour did it because

19:18.600 --> 19:22.420
she's not very pally with anyone, but I still worry how many people criticise her

19:22.420 --> 19:27.600
of this move on the basis of the very superficial factors, as if anyone else making the points

19:27.600 --> 19:33.300
here would somehow improve the video, no, it is bad regardless, and it is time we put

19:33.300 --> 19:35.020
it to bed.

19:35.020 --> 19:38.620
In the Instagram response, Arbour says a fair few things that I would like to challenge,

19:38.620 --> 19:42.200
I've already addressed her first few paragraphs fairly comprehensively, I don't think there's

19:42.200 --> 19:46.300
any issue presenting your own take on This is America, but you have to nail down key

19:46.300 --> 19:51.280
narrative anchors, and that's where I feel Arbour falls flat on her face in this instance,

19:51.280 --> 19:56.180
she tries to make her post a message of positivity and empathy and kindness and talk about how

19:56.180 --> 19:59.360
she believes the best thing to happen is to be able to record their own version of the

19:59.360 --> 20:04.360
video and talk about their own personal experience, and I think that underlines how badly she's

20:04.360 --> 20:08.160
missed the message of Gambino's video, the original touches on themes that although may

20:08.160 --> 20:12.080
be affecting certain demographics more than others, is not a personal experience, it's

20:12.080 --> 20:16.080
a greater cultural statement, you don't need This is America to talk about your own

20:16.080 --> 20:20.380
personal experiences in America, there's always a musical platform to do that, so if

20:20.380 --> 20:23.660
you do understand the core message of This is America, you should also understand that

20:23.660 --> 20:27.320
it's not personal and doesn't need loads of people trying to make their own personalised

20:27.320 --> 20:30.600
versions of it, because otherwise you're changing the context to the point where the

20:30.600 --> 20:34.480
only things you're attaining are the title and the beats, the only way to remake new

20:34.480 --> 20:38.480
interpretations of this would be to make it for different countries, and even then, you're

20:38.480 --> 20:43.560
rocking a tightrope trying to avoid scrambling multiple coincided messages, the very carefully

20:43.560 --> 20:44.560
weaved.

20:44.560 --> 20:47.560
If you're going to change the message so much, then there's no point in using the

20:47.560 --> 20:49.560
source as the foundation.

20:49.560 --> 20:54.000
As I mentioned earlier, she drops in this notion of North America as some sort of deflection,

20:54.000 --> 20:58.480
Arber is implying that this isn't about the US but more a collective problem in both the

20:58.480 --> 20:59.480
US and Canada?

20:59.480 --> 21:03.280
Firstly, if that's the case, you shouldn't have titled your video exactly the same as

21:03.280 --> 21:06.680
the original, because everyone's going into it expecting reference to the United States

21:06.680 --> 21:07.680
of America.

21:07.680 --> 21:11.220
I get that you're equivocating it to the continent, but it's a pretty misleading equivocation

21:11.220 --> 21:12.720
with the context provided.

21:12.720 --> 21:16.520
Secondly, including Canada seems literally just a way to dodge the you're not American

21:16.520 --> 21:20.800
criticism, it doesn't enhance the points, nor does it make it more unique when you include

21:20.800 --> 21:25.160
Canada, and therefore the point is just lost in a seemingly rhetorical distraction device.

21:25.160 --> 21:28.880
I'm all for empathy, I'm sure others will tell you Nicole that there is no gentleman

21:28.880 --> 21:33.960
more empathetic than yours truly, but peace, love and positivity will not make a bad song

21:34.240 --> 21:43.920
And this is often a problem with Nicole, she seems to make these arguments in the worst

21:43.920 --> 21:44.920
way possible.

21:44.920 --> 21:49.060
I've rewatched some of Nicole's more controversial videos, and although the core messages may

21:49.060 --> 21:53.520
not be corrupted, they're delivered in such an assertive way that they undermine any notion

21:53.520 --> 21:58.000
of empathy that she might want to get across, they're so directed that they make the subject

21:58.000 --> 22:02.040
of the video defensive over their identity rather than attempting to listen to what she's

22:02.040 --> 22:03.040
trying to say.

22:03.040 --> 22:07.440
I have no doubt that people just saw some of her dear people videos and immediately

22:07.440 --> 22:10.460
disliked because of the attitude that such a title radiates.

22:10.460 --> 22:14.540
The controversy drowns out whatever message you claim to be promoting, rendering the message

22:14.540 --> 22:16.020
itself pointless.

22:16.020 --> 22:20.080
And even then, at least you could argue that those videos offered some sort of substantial

22:20.080 --> 22:21.080
narrative.

22:21.080 --> 22:24.640
This video just coasts off controversy over a message that is barely there, and certainly

22:24.640 --> 22:26.480
nothing remotely thought provoking.

22:26.480 --> 22:29.960
There are thousands of better ways you can raise awareness to your issues, and I do not

22:29.960 --> 22:31.480
believe you're ignorant to them.

22:31.480 --> 22:34.520
And therefore my verdict on your response is bullshit.

22:34.520 --> 22:38.120
I don't care if you're offensive, controversial, so on.

22:38.120 --> 22:41.840
Comedy is that sometimes, and I don't think we should ever sacrifice that, but if you

22:41.840 --> 22:45.980
want to make decent social commentary within that comedy, in my opinion, you're not doing

22:45.980 --> 22:46.980
it right.

22:46.980 --> 22:51.320
This latest venture of This Is America is barely identifiable as comedy, I think most

22:51.320 --> 22:55.400
people are still not 100% sure of what it's meant to be, and so in the end it just ends

22:55.400 --> 22:59.880
up like a mess, and all it becomes identifiable for is its controversial premise which is

22:59.880 --> 23:04.780
inevitably picked up by semi-famous commentators to explain why this song doesn't sound nice.

23:04.780 --> 23:08.600
Which is fine, they can do that, but there's so many more layers of bad to this that it

23:08.600 --> 23:12.220
had to be laid to rest, and hopefully that's what I've done to date.

23:12.220 --> 23:15.960
If you care about learning, then the first thing you will do is learn that great content

23:15.960 --> 23:20.680
takes time, and having a written, recorded, choreographed song out barely a week after

23:20.680 --> 23:24.680
the original in such a half-baked manner does not reflect that philosophy, it seems like

23:24.680 --> 23:28.680
a trending cash grab, and I'm not saying that's what you did, but that's how many

23:28.680 --> 23:33.000
perceived it, and due to it they rejected your message altogether, which surely is not

23:33.000 --> 23:35.200
what you want, correct?

23:35.200 --> 23:38.960
Take home message, causes are important to people, if you want to see change in the world

23:38.960 --> 23:43.240
more power to you, work for it, but do it gracefully and try to avoid appearing to piggyback

23:43.240 --> 23:47.800
off other causes in the process, I don't believe a cause's validity necessarily hinges

23:47.800 --> 23:52.120
on the proponents alone, and Abra is no prominent member of such a cause, but if she herself

23:52.120 --> 23:56.040
cares about it she should care about how people may judge it, and I think that's what raises

23:56.040 --> 24:00.260
red flags on her motivations, I think they are very justified red flags, the song itself

24:00.260 --> 24:04.520
is uninspired and poorly written, showing a very surface level understanding of problems

24:04.520 --> 24:08.760
relevant to our society, and it does not deserve a pass for its message alone, even if the

24:08.760 --> 24:13.700
message was decent, which as I've discussed, is debatable, they're hardly problems relevant

24:13.700 --> 24:17.440
in the way that the original presented them, and it rips narrative from the original while

24:17.440 --> 24:21.760
introducing new elements that don't work either, I know a lot of people already hate

24:21.760 --> 24:25.920
it, but hopefully I've given more of a justification for why people hate it, it's not just a

24:25.920 --> 24:30.640
white vs black issue as Vice have portrayed it, but plenty more legitimate criticisms

24:30.640 --> 24:38.800
that if you care, you won't ignore, otherwise, I think it's time we let this die, R.I.P.

24:55.920 --> 25:00.200
fashion, though sometimes it does get a bit too toxic for me, admittedly, otherwise you

25:00.200 --> 25:04.260
can reach me on facebook, you can reach me on twitter, I have open DMs, I tend to reply

25:04.260 --> 25:08.240
to most people, also, I'm trying to be more active in my discord server though that is

25:08.240 --> 25:12.760
currently failing, I will get there in the end, trust me on that one, otherwise I don't

25:12.760 --> 25:15.840
think there's too much else to say, thanks for all your support of recent, it means a

25:15.840 --> 25:20.440
lot, we're making great progress, at the time of recording this I just hit 20,000 subscribers

25:20.440 --> 25:24.340
and it means a hell of a lot, I'm really trying hard to get these videos out, and hopefully

25:24.460 --> 25:28.580
this one will be one that sees the light of day as well, until then however, I'm the

25:28.580 --> 25:30.980
Right Opinion, and I'll see you, in the next one.
