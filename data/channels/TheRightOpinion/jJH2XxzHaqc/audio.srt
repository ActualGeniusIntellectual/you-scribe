00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,960
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,460
too much free time, and, oh boy, have we got a lot to unbox today.

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,080
In case anyone isn't aware, I'm a man of music, I have reviewed music on this channel,

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,300
I've covered various controversies with regards to music, I've talked about provocative

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,640
content and it creates probably some of my most polarising content.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,820
I'm also a trained singer-songwriter and I guarantee you when I get the chance The

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,700
Right Opinion is dropping a fucking fire album that blows all of these hoes out of

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,700
the water.

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,580
But that's besides the point, I've realised that now I'm doing longer content that it's

10
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,240
not going to be so easy to just chuck out my opinions on music, and often given the

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,140
length of the song, it's hard to talk in the mini-documentary styles that I do, but

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,820
that won't stop me from trying, and every now and then an absolute sitter comes in and

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,580
I have to take a swing.

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,620
Enter stage left Nicole Arbour, the comedian slash YouTube personality, has caused a fair

15
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,660
bit of commotion throughout her career.

16
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:58,340
Famously in 2015 she decided to release a video known as Dear Fat People, in which she

17
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,500
criticised obese individuals for their excessive weight and told them to lose it in quite a

18
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,500
crude manner.

19
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:22,020
A lot of people took offence to the blunt way that she attacked others, and yes it is

20
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,600
rather provocative, and revisiting it in preparation for this video, in all honesty, the only thing

21
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,540
I actually found offensive was how unfunny it was.

22
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,220
Now I accept comedy as subjective, but it was all this distraction comedy with no real

23
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,220
punchline to me.

24
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,680
But yeah, that regardless I can understand why people were annoyed by it, and in true

25
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,360
controversial fashion she released a part too, I assume because she had so much more

26
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,000
to develop from the first one, but it had been a couple years and she had ducked down

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,900
to the public eye, I certainly wasn't thinking about her.

28
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,060
As a stage right, Donald Glover aka Childish Gambino, the jack of all trades, has been

29
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,120
praised for his work all over the spectrum of media from script writing to music production,

30
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,860
I have to give him props for that, I respect that grind, but realising that he had yet

31
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,720
to make a vociferous political statement, he decided that why not infuse that with his

32
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,300
natural talents, and brought us This is America.

33
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,660
The meticulously crafted creation impressed me on both a technical level and an interpretive

34
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,660
level.

35
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,220
As someone who really does enjoy artistry, I cannot express how much I appreciate the

36
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,240
detail of the subtext and imagery, too many artists just don't appreciate how much more

37
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,060
potent it can make your content.

38
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,900
I think that part of the appeal is the multitude of interpretations, and I'm glad that people

39
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,860
are discussing it, and hopefully it will inspire more profound conversation.

40
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,480
But nothing is sacred, and Nicole Arbour saw a chance to give it her own spin, well not

41
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,920
necessarily her own personal spin, but a women's spin, one from women's rights and highlighting

42
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,620
their maltreatment in modern American society.

43
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,620
How brave.

44
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,060
Now if you aren't familiar with me and the title of this video, you will be bracing

45
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,840
to what is an inevitable amount of criticism that is about to be thrown her way.

46
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,140
My opinion is that this is bad, very bad, I'd heard she'd responded to some of the

47
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,580
criticism, and when I read it she really did make a compelling case for her content.

48
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,620
And then I went and watched it again and reminded myself that actually it was pretty bad, and

49
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,620
it did deserve this video.

50
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,700
Due to the backlash she has subsequently disabled ratings and comments, but it wasn't well

51
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,380
received to say the least at first, with many people claiming she had completely butchered

52
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,700
what the original stood for.

53
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,660
How many have criticised her as making a cynical cash-in, riding on the coattails of something

54
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,660
so much better.

55
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,620
But I'm going to go into this video with an optimistic outlook of her character, the

56
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,980
right opinion is a pure heart, he believes in benefit of the doubt.

57
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,460
What a merciful soul I am.

58
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,000
I think the fact that she's white doesn't really undermine the message necessarily,

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,460
the validity of the statements about general issues are not dependent on who is saying

60
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,540
it, only statements about personal experience might be able to be judged on such a merit.

61
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,060
Though I have to say, I do find it quite weird out of everyone to make such a unique

62
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,180
commentary on the female American experience, it was a Canadian.

63
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,180
And let me make this clear, I think anyone can talk about politics from foreign countries,

64
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,780
I talk about American politics all the time, but this is so identifiably quintessentially

65
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,860
American, it seems exceptionally strange for her to come and speak about it herself.

66
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,260
However, as we will soon find out, Arbors version isn't really that American.

67
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,160
You are obviously going to be compared on many levels to the original, especially if

68
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,300
you try and draw parallels, which is what Nicole Arber attempts to do, so you better

69
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,520
make sure yours at least bangs, right?

70
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
Right.

71
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,000
I know a lot of people have memed it and laughed at it, and I've done that as well, a majority

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,100
of people do agree that it's pretty bad, but no one's tied down the little details that

73
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,280
in my opinion make it much more egregious than the mediocre offerings often presented

74
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,000
to us within musical wokeness.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,200
I hope that today's video will not just provide a comprehensive criticism of the individual

76
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,400
question but also give some valuable lessons that everyone can take something away from

77
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,840
in critical thinking.

78
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,480
So today I'm going to be explaining my problems with Nicole Arber's musical magnum opus that

79
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,120
is known as This is America Women's Edit, and boy are you in for a treat.

80
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,280
Without further ado, let's get to it.

81
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,760
Let's discuss the premise, now when your video is titled This is America, what is the first

82
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,120
thing that comes to mind?

83
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,800
That this is America.

84
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,760
This video is going to be documenting the struggles that will make someone think of

85
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,760
that message.

86
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,280
Now in this instance, with regards to the original title, Childish Gambino made it quite

87
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,440
clear that there was a level of exclusivity to his statements.

88
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,880
With all these various coinciding messages, it created an image of something very specific

89
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,080
to America, maybe even being able to specify it to a specific indictment of media-driven

90
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,960
fantasy within America, and their relationship with the deeply impoverished reality of many

91
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,600
of its citizens, a juxtaposition whose magnitude is arguably very unique to the US.

92
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,200
But anyone who does copy the message has to at least use that template.

93
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,320
What do we get with Nicole Arber?

94
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,920
Well a string of messages that don't really come together at all, especially with regards

95
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
to America.

96
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,080
Let's try to break this down, now it's important to note that Nicole Arber clarifies the target

97
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,620
of the video as North America, to try and sidestep the inevitable criticism that she's

98
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,280
not from the states, and we'll address this response later.

99
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,440
So where can we start?

100
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,320
A high majority of the problems listed off by Nicole Arber are America, but there are

101
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,900
also a multitude of other countries across the world, so immediately the statement, this

102
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,480
is America, does not hold the same weight.

103
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,440
Let's break down some of the original messages, and have a gander.

104
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,320
She wrote a little Instagram post where she listed off all the topics that she was trying

105
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
to touch on.

106
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,420
I wanted to knock two on the head fairly immediately, the shaming of breastfeeding, I assume she

107
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,800
means public breastfeeding, and the gender pay gap.

108
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,680
Okay let's say these are problems, are they really America?

109
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,360
The stigma around breastfeeding exists throughout the world, and the gender pay gap is a very

110
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,120
complex question, and people haven't solved it not because they're not aware of it, but

111
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,600
because people don't agree on how to solve it, or even whether it needs to be solved

112
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
or not.

113
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,960
Bruce Hornsby did a song in 1987 called The Way It Is, smash hit, incredible piano work,

114
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,280
but it was also a statement about civil rights, and in it he makes the statement that although

115
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,100
civil rights laws have been established, some people will be racist and prejudice nonetheless,

116
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,080
because the law doesn't change in their minds, and that it is something that we should challenge

117
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,160
without a doubt, but it's a slow process, but the reason we haven't circumvented it

118
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,760
isn't because we don't know it exists, we completely get it.

119
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,780
With issues like this, if discrimination exists, the fact that both the rights of breastfeeding

120
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,340
and equal pay are protected by legislation makes the problem more difficult than just

121
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,340
noticing it.

122
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,760
You can't actively discriminate on the basis of gender, and you're allowed to publicly

123
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,840
breastfeed apart from in Idaho, so if you want to make a point about Idaho, then go

124
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
for it.

125
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,100
But for some reason, I don't think this is an open attack on Idaho.

126
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,360
Legislation isn't the problem necessarily, it's a mentality, it's the fact that some

127
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,920
people are still judgemental.

128
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,680
Now if you want to argue with them, then more power to you, but observing that it exists

129
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,560
is not an argument in itself, it'd be like me saying racism exists.

130
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,680
Okay, where's my fucking Nobel Peace Prize?

131
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,920
We've passed that stage Nicole, people have already developed their arguments on these

132
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,040
topics, you're decades behind.

133
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,360
And besides that, as I said, this is not just America, this is a multitude of cultures including

134
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,260
America, and yes, I know she included a specific case about cheerleaders, but that's almost

135
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,240
a red herring in a way, it's providing a specific example and therefore concluding

136
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,840
that the problem itself must be specific, which isn't the case, the problem will yield

137
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,880
many specific examples all over the world, but that does not undermine its generality.

138
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,800
Let's talk about sexual assault and harassment, two other topics that she touches on.

139
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,600
It would be crass to lump them in with the other two topics I just mentioned because

140
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,040
although they're also legislated against, they're a different type of issue, a much

141
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,360
more serious one.

142
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,260
Sexual harassment and assault are definitely women's issues, and we should definitely

143
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,460
be working to stem those issues, but once again, it's not necessarily a cultural phenomenon

144
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,560
and reports have been on the decline.

145
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,360
Criminal activity will always exist, it's just unfortunately given the matrices of power

146
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,720
passed on successive societies, the crimes are slanted against women in those subjects,

147
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,480
just like a majority of other crimes are slanted against men.

148
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,480
We shouldn't accept it by any means, but it's not stimulated solely in America.

149
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,280
Now at this point, some may argue that this is a point against a lot of childish Gambino's

150
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,680
points, and although not entirely incorrect, Gambino appears to be outlining an environment

151
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,680
that has cultivated the current predicament, and each individual general problem crafts

152
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,960
an individual image that is fairly specific to America, with its hysterical media almost

153
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,040
acting as a source of supernormal stimuli, detracting from the disturbing truth.

154
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,360
It is central to every problem that Gambino crafts, creating an image that although affecting

155
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,440
a general population, is very specific in its framework.

156
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,440
Arber seems to assort a load of problems, but none of them seem to go together to create

157
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,420
anything particularly coherent other than a collection of observations linked by the

158
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,280
fact that they're primarily women's issues.

159
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,920
And that's in part why message-wise, it fails so badly, not because she's necessarily white,

160
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,820
that's a lazy cop-out and it's allowed her to actually defend it.

161
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,680
It fails as an interpretation because it tries to parallel the message and fails.

162
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,820
Let me expand.

163
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,900
Why does West Side Story as an interpretation of Romeo and Juliet work?

164
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,720
Because it touches on the key elemental plot points that Romeo and Juliet set up and therefore

165
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,840
made it identifiable with the source material.

166
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,580
If it hadn't, it wouldn't have been an interpretation, it would have just been its own piece.

167
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,980
And that wouldn't have necessarily been a bad thing, but the worst possible combination

168
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,100
is when you so blatantly try to mirror the original by ripping the beat, the key hooks

169
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,500
and the phrases to the point of mimicry and yet in everything you change, you fail.

170
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,400
That's what Nicole Arber's done in the most atrocious, borderline insulting way possible.

171
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,140
That's not saying that you can't integrate source material into crafting a different

172
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,140
message.

173
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,140
Plenty of artists have done that.

174
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,980
Stan and Eminem sampling Dido's Thank You is an excellent example, but that worked because

175
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,580
it was totally consistent.

176
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,660
In this instance, the context provided with the original just shows up Arber's cover in

177
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,540
an even more embarrassing way.

178
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,460
When Charles Gambino crafts this greater message about social media, it is essential

179
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,780
to the song, to the point where if you removed it, the other messages from the song wouldn't

180
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,780
make sense.

181
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:24,100
Arber, yeah, she does mention social media, in her own words, social media on modern relationships

182
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,100
and self.

183
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,740
Now, if we are to try and unpack that vagueness in comparison, we can assume that with the

184
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,360
subtle symbolism, wink fucking wink, in the video that she is referring to the culture

185
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,700
of vanity and self-consciousness that seems more prevalent with females on social media,

186
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,820
perpetuated through unrealistic beauty standards.

187
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,260
With regards to social media on relationships, there isn't much to see in the video, although

188
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,820
I assume the handing out of hearts following the wedding is how relationships have evolved

189
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,660
from families to women seeking confirmation through guys and their social media hearts

190
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,940
rather than actual love.

191
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,300
You know the sort of thing that Hollywood thought it was trendy to point out in like

192
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,300
2010?

193
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,620
If I removed these two messages, nothing would change about the video.

194
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,620
They're not integral.

195
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,640
This is some of the most derivative, box-ticking activism in the face of one of the most multifaceted

196
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,960
artistic statements in a while, and its vapid, surface-level approach to the messages is

197
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,680
so transparent.

198
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,520
So, so transparent.

199
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,480
And now I wanted to talk about two other topics, which is apparently the labels and the pressures.

200
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,480
And yes, you know what?

201
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,960
It is a shame that society is judgmental sometimes, but it's so common you've probably done it

202
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,640
a fair few times yourself.

203
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,960
You ever look at a fat person and think, boy, why didn't they just lose some weight?

204
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,360
There's nothing stopping them.

205
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,440
Oh, wait, yes you did, and made a two-part series on it.

206
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,540
Why do we do that?

207
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,800
It's called heuristics.

208
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,120
We create certain stereotypes of characteristics that make it easier for us to judge people.

209
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,200
They're flawed mechanisms, but a lot of people use them nonetheless.

210
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,420
This was also addressed in a song called Follow Your Arrow by Kacey Musgraves a few years

211
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,420
ago.

212
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,040
An infinitely better song, which is much nicer on the ears as well, and it deals with the

213
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,980
issues of a judgmental society in a more compact, listenable, and nuanced way.

214
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,860
The issue is, as Musgraves points out, that most of us are going to be regularly exposed

215
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,960
to heuristics and stereotypes of what people think we're like, and yet in the chorus

216
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,640
she declares that you might as well just do whatever the fuck you want and do your best

217
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,240
to work with it, because people are always going to judge.

218
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,760
Now there are definitely gender-based judgments, but whether they're really slanted one way

219
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,080
that much is questionable.

220
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,920
Equality in this instance is a nice idea, but the only real equality you'll get between

221
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,640
demographics is when those within the demographics are equally as judgmental.

222
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,880
You'll never really eradicate it, but if you want to try, you should probably start to

223
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,280
practice what you preach.

224
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,220
You've already noticed that throughout this section I've chucked in various references

225
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,940
to other, and in my opinion, better music and art.

226
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,940
That's because there is nothing inspired here.

227
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,740
It's rehashed old content that would have been dated in its message a decade ago.

228
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,100
There are numerous artists who've dealt with this in a much more mature way and don't have

229
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,060
to fuck up another song in the process, and in doing so completely skewed its own message

230
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,880
because it failed to understand how connected the messages of the original were.

231
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,320
She couldn't even interpret it to make it culturally specific about the United States

232
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
of America.

233
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,940
Now if I was in this video rapping, we'll say North America, but none of this is remotely

234
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,300
unique from any South American country either.

235
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,740
You think they don't have literally every problem you've listed here in South America?

236
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,100
And if you tried this dirty to create an all-American image, a lot of Gambino's messages standalone

237
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,100
do not amount to specific scenarios, but the way he created a subtext that molded them

238
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,580
together makes the final image a lot more identifiable with the thesis statement.

239
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,620
That is not present in Arbor's version, and there is a lot to be said in its musical failures,

240
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,740
which is where we are fucking going next.

241
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,960
As I pointed out earlier, Arbor's song fails as an interpretation because she takes so

242
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,560
many of the devices used in the original but also tries to substitute elements that created

243
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,400
this incoherent mess.

244
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,480
But let's try to break down the specifics that aid the creation of such a failure, and

245
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,920
on a technical level where the flaws really come to showing why Nicole should maybe have

246
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,920
given this endeavor a break.

247
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,920
Let's compare the interpretation with the original.

248
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,800
One of the largest flaws in Nicole's version is that she relies on text over subtext.

249
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:00,740
A lot of what Childish Gambino's work focused on was that a very high majority of the lyrics

250
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,060
would not be out of place on any brag rap song, and therefore by contrasting them with

251
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:09,860
the grim reality of the connotations, it allows the message to be conveyed quite smartly.

252
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:14,580
Nicole rips many lines from Gambino's original, and therefore you'd need it to be consistent

253
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,700
with the balance of text to subtext.

254
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:21,700
However, a lot of the changes she makes tend to push towards surface-level text.

255
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:26,240
A really simple example of how it doesn't work is the switching of slipping for climbing

256
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,440
in the chorus.

257
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,540
In Gambino's song the line, Don't Catch You Slipping Now has an urgency of how an

258
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,880
individual may want to watch themselves.

259
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,720
One wrong move could cause dangerous repercussions, but the delivery almost revels in it.

260
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,720
Many rappers enjoy invoking the idea of fear over their enemies.

261
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,960
ABBA users don't catch you climbing up, as a statement about women's lack of social

262
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,860
mobility, but the issue there is that there is no subtext, people don't glorify the

263
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,860
glass ceiling.

264
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:57,240
Okay, so she changes it a bit, not a huge problem until you try to mimic the subtext.

265
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,480
In the original Gambino uses multiple lines with a lot of subtext, one example I could

266
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,200
extract is The Police Be Tripping Now, which to me is used to demonstrate how rappers often

267
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,820
mock the problems that don't affect them anymore, despite them purportedly remaining

268
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,120
prevalent within their former societies.

269
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,060
Nicole ABBA switches this and says The Boys Be Tripping Now.

270
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,960
Now firstly, in this moment it's already hard to identify subtext because many of the

271
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,620
issues she identifies in her Instagram don't necessarily go away with success, but it also

272
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,420
creates a very confusing contextual narrative.

273
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:31,340
Whereas Childish Gambino's rap portrays an unsettlingly ignorant caricature, Nicole

274
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,780
ABBA's characters regularly switches back and forth between Childish Gambino-esque mimicry

275
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,540
and just another activist pointing out these problems within society, at one point she

276
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,340
literally responds to her own observation going, what the fuck?

277
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:47,100
Creating this completely inconsistent narrative which is impossible to follow, it's really

278
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,680
fucking sloppy on a technical level, which even if what she was trying to say was new

279
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,360
or provocative, she'd have lost it in the delivery because she tried to nab certain

280
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,120
themes and abandon others, not realising that they were all complimentary to each other,

281
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,840
and as soon as you desert that, you end up with this.

282
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,000
What else can be said about this then?

283
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,020
Well, ABBA doesn't necessarily quite nail the delivery either.

284
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,000
In Gambino's the rapper recites his verses coldly with a very deadpan delivery which

285
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,480
often played contrast to his very flamboyant choreography, ABBA on the other hand is vocally

286
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,620
all over the place and I am aware that she is known for her exuberant performances but

287
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,640
by having such a hammy vocal delivery, it undermines whatever message was attempting

288
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,640
to be made.

289
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,480
She claims that the tone is tongue in cheek on her Instagram and maybe that would explain

290
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,900
the vocals but the issue is that it doesn't match anything else that she is trying to

291
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,860
do, changing your voice does not enhance the song, in fact the art of tongue in cheek content

292
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,260
often requires some maintenance of the tone of the original, while creating surreal different

293
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,920
scenarios for that grounded tone to remain, rather than vice versa, and it certainly doesn't

294
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,480
work over something as dark as this.

295
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,280
Her singing vocals slapped all over the musical interludes are not done very well either,

296
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,240
Gambino's have clearly been very carefully placed with regards to the instrumentation,

297
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,580
the opening set of vocals are particularly well mixed, with the lyrics just creeping

298
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,520
through but drowned out in a sinister mix, it really creates this haunting atmosphere,

299
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,620
in ABBA's it just sounds like she's had a few too many vodkas before the studio session.

300
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,620
The instrumental has also been awkwardly changed, for some reason the dentist drill

301
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:15,920
synth is slathered on the top of the mix and it sounds extremely irritating, and for some

302
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,440
reason they've moved the propulsive bass line to the back of the mix, it honestly seems

303
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,320
like the producer hated this song as much as I do because anyone making those production

304
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,440
decisions did not do them out of love for this concoction, and yet all of these hail

305
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,920
in comparison to the last minute and a half of this song which is just awful, firstly

306
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:39,880
she says this, which is just diabolical, considering the context of the song and on

307
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,500
a technical level alone, she then proceeds to make a clumsily delivered line about the

308
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,240
Taliban before taking a moment to actually explain the reference, which is not something

309
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,980
you as an artist should ever do in the song unless it's to purposefully convey awkwardness,

310
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,460
which it doesn't, it just seems like she's worried that people may think it's a bad

311
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,860
line, which it is.

312
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,160
Then she does a tap dance, which I assume is her tongue in cheek interpretation of that

313
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:06,160
quirky childish Gambino moment, before following this with an outro reflecting Gambino's

314
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,080
video, the video finishes with the quote, if I were a guy, you wouldn't be asking

315
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,000
yourself, I wonder who wrote that, but I think we can say with a decent amount of confidence

316
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,720
that Nicole Arbour definitely wrote that, because heaven knows who else would consciously

317
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,600
attach their name to such a messy statement.

318
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,840
I'm being harsh, but this all comes across to me as incredibly lazy, hamfisted, and lacking

319
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,220
any sort of real investment from its performer.

320
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,100
Although I do concur with a lot of the original source material, I don't agree with every

321
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,000
single measure that I have derived from it, and I wouldn't expect to, but I do have

322
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,740
a hell of a lot of respect with how it works as an artistic statement, Arbour has no grip

323
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,740
of that.

324
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,300
Her content doesn't work as satire because the messages hold no weight and the humour

325
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,220
is dead, it doesn't work as a social statement because there is nothing more than observations

326
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,260
of problems that don't even tie into the supposed overarching narrative, it doesn't

327
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,880
work as a musical piece because the music isn't original and nowhere near as well

328
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,080
mixed as the original, and when you have so many other musicians making better crafted

329
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,600
social statements, why would you ever choose someone who basically uses a quote good cause

330
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,000
as a shield to make this?

331
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,060
And unfortunately, that's what a lot of people do, a lot of people think that marching

332
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:14,720
under a banner of righteousness will somehow alleviate criticism, but it should not, and

333
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,600
it won't round here, and I'm kind of relieved that of all people Nicole Arbour did it because

334
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,420
she's not very pally with anyone, but I still worry how many people criticise her

335
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:27,600
of this move on the basis of the very superficial factors, as if anyone else making the points

336
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:33,300
here would somehow improve the video, no, it is bad regardless, and it is time we put

337
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,020
it to bed.

338
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,620
In the Instagram response, Arbour says a fair few things that I would like to challenge,

339
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,200
I've already addressed her first few paragraphs fairly comprehensively, I don't think there's

340
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,300
any issue presenting your own take on This is America, but you have to nail down key

341
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:51,280
narrative anchors, and that's where I feel Arbour falls flat on her face in this instance,

342
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,180
she tries to make her post a message of positivity and empathy and kindness and talk about how

343
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,360
she believes the best thing to happen is to be able to record their own version of the

344
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,360
video and talk about their own personal experience, and I think that underlines how badly she's

345
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,160
missed the message of Gambino's video, the original touches on themes that although may

346
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,080
be affecting certain demographics more than others, is not a personal experience, it's

347
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,080
a greater cultural statement, you don't need This is America to talk about your own

348
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,380
personal experiences in America, there's always a musical platform to do that, so if

349
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,660
you do understand the core message of This is America, you should also understand that

350
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,320
it's not personal and doesn't need loads of people trying to make their own personalised

351
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,600
versions of it, because otherwise you're changing the context to the point where the

352
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,480
only things you're attaining are the title and the beats, the only way to remake new

353
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,480
interpretations of this would be to make it for different countries, and even then, you're

354
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,560
rocking a tightrope trying to avoid scrambling multiple coincided messages, the very carefully

355
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,560
weaved.

356
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,560
If you're going to change the message so much, then there's no point in using the

357
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,560
source as the foundation.

358
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:54,000
As I mentioned earlier, she drops in this notion of North America as some sort of deflection,

359
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,480
Arber is implying that this isn't about the US but more a collective problem in both the

360
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,480
US and Canada?

361
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,280
Firstly, if that's the case, you shouldn't have titled your video exactly the same as

362
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,680
the original, because everyone's going into it expecting reference to the United States

363
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,680
of America.

364
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,220
I get that you're equivocating it to the continent, but it's a pretty misleading equivocation

365
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,720
with the context provided.

366
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,520
Secondly, including Canada seems literally just a way to dodge the you're not American

367
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,800
criticism, it doesn't enhance the points, nor does it make it more unique when you include

368
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,160
Canada, and therefore the point is just lost in a seemingly rhetorical distraction device.

369
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,880
I'm all for empathy, I'm sure others will tell you Nicole that there is no gentleman

370
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,960
more empathetic than yours truly, but peace, love and positivity will not make a bad song

371
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:43,920
And this is often a problem with Nicole, she seems to make these arguments in the worst

372
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,920
way possible.

373
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,060
I've rewatched some of Nicole's more controversial videos, and although the core messages may

374
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:53,520
not be corrupted, they're delivered in such an assertive way that they undermine any notion

375
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,000
of empathy that she might want to get across, they're so directed that they make the subject

376
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,040
of the video defensive over their identity rather than attempting to listen to what she's

377
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,040
trying to say.

378
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,440
I have no doubt that people just saw some of her dear people videos and immediately

379
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,460
disliked because of the attitude that such a title radiates.

380
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,540
The controversy drowns out whatever message you claim to be promoting, rendering the message

381
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,020
itself pointless.

382
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:20,080
And even then, at least you could argue that those videos offered some sort of substantial

383
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,080
narrative.

384
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,640
This video just coasts off controversy over a message that is barely there, and certainly

385
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,480
nothing remotely thought provoking.

386
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,960
There are thousands of better ways you can raise awareness to your issues, and I do not

387
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,480
believe you're ignorant to them.

388
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,520
And therefore my verdict on your response is bullshit.

389
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,120
I don't care if you're offensive, controversial, so on.

390
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,840
Comedy is that sometimes, and I don't think we should ever sacrifice that, but if you

391
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,980
want to make decent social commentary within that comedy, in my opinion, you're not doing

392
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,980
it right.

393
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,320
This latest venture of This Is America is barely identifiable as comedy, I think most

394
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,400
people are still not 100% sure of what it's meant to be, and so in the end it just ends

395
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,880
up like a mess, and all it becomes identifiable for is its controversial premise which is

396
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,780
inevitably picked up by semi-famous commentators to explain why this song doesn't sound nice.

397
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:08,600
Which is fine, they can do that, but there's so many more layers of bad to this that it

398
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,220
had to be laid to rest, and hopefully that's what I've done to date.

399
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,960
If you care about learning, then the first thing you will do is learn that great content

400
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,680
takes time, and having a written, recorded, choreographed song out barely a week after

401
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,680
the original in such a half-baked manner does not reflect that philosophy, it seems like

402
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,680
a trending cash grab, and I'm not saying that's what you did, but that's how many

403
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:33,000
perceived it, and due to it they rejected your message altogether, which surely is not

404
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,200
what you want, correct?

405
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,960
Take home message, causes are important to people, if you want to see change in the world

406
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,240
more power to you, work for it, but do it gracefully and try to avoid appearing to piggyback

407
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,800
off other causes in the process, I don't believe a cause's validity necessarily hinges

408
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,120
on the proponents alone, and Abra is no prominent member of such a cause, but if she herself

409
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,040
cares about it she should care about how people may judge it, and I think that's what raises

410
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,260
red flags on her motivations, I think they are very justified red flags, the song itself

411
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:04,520
is uninspired and poorly written, showing a very surface level understanding of problems

412
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,760
relevant to our society, and it does not deserve a pass for its message alone, even if the

413
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,700
message was decent, which as I've discussed, is debatable, they're hardly problems relevant

414
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,440
in the way that the original presented them, and it rips narrative from the original while

415
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,760
introducing new elements that don't work either, I know a lot of people already hate

416
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,920
it, but hopefully I've given more of a justification for why people hate it, it's not just a

417
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,640
white vs black issue as Vice have portrayed it, but plenty more legitimate criticisms

418
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:38,800
that if you care, you won't ignore, otherwise, I think it's time we let this die, R.I.P.

419
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,200
fashion, though sometimes it does get a bit too toxic for me, admittedly, otherwise you

420
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,260
can reach me on facebook, you can reach me on twitter, I have open DMs, I tend to reply

421
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:08,240
to most people, also, I'm trying to be more active in my discord server though that is

422
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,760
currently failing, I will get there in the end, trust me on that one, otherwise I don't

423
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,840
think there's too much else to say, thanks for all your support of recent, it means a

424
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,440
lot, we're making great progress, at the time of recording this I just hit 20,000 subscribers

425
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,340
and it means a hell of a lot, I'm really trying hard to get these videos out, and hopefully

426
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,580
this one will be one that sees the light of day as well, until then however, I'm the

427
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,980
Right Opinion, and I'll see you, in the next one.
