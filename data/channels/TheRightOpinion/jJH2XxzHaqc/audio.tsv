0	8960	Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
8960	13460	too much free time, and, oh boy, have we got a lot to unbox today.
13460	17080	In case anyone isn't aware, I'm a man of music, I have reviewed music on this channel,
17080	20300	I've covered various controversies with regards to music, I've talked about provocative
20300	23640	content and it creates probably some of my most polarising content.
23640	26820	I'm also a trained singer-songwriter and I guarantee you when I get the chance The
26820	30700	Right Opinion is dropping a fucking fire album that blows all of these hoes out of
30700	31700	the water.
31700	34580	But that's besides the point, I've realised that now I'm doing longer content that it's
34580	38240	not going to be so easy to just chuck out my opinions on music, and often given the
38240	42140	length of the song, it's hard to talk in the mini-documentary styles that I do, but
42140	45820	that won't stop me from trying, and every now and then an absolute sitter comes in and
45820	47580	I have to take a swing.
47580	51620	Enter stage left Nicole Arbour, the comedian slash YouTube personality, has caused a fair
51620	53660	bit of commotion throughout her career.
53660	58340	Famously in 2015 she decided to release a video known as Dear Fat People, in which she
58340	62500	criticised obese individuals for their excessive weight and told them to lose it in quite a
62500	63500	crude manner.
63500	82020	A lot of people took offence to the blunt way that she attacked others, and yes it is
82020	86600	rather provocative, and revisiting it in preparation for this video, in all honesty, the only thing
86600	89540	I actually found offensive was how unfunny it was.
89540	93220	Now I accept comedy as subjective, but it was all this distraction comedy with no real
93220	94220	punchline to me.
94220	97680	But yeah, that regardless I can understand why people were annoyed by it, and in true
97680	101360	controversial fashion she released a part too, I assume because she had so much more
101360	105000	to develop from the first one, but it had been a couple years and she had ducked down
105000	107900	to the public eye, I certainly wasn't thinking about her.
107900	112060	As a stage right, Donald Glover aka Childish Gambino, the jack of all trades, has been
112060	116120	praised for his work all over the spectrum of media from script writing to music production,
116120	119860	I have to give him props for that, I respect that grind, but realising that he had yet
119860	123720	to make a vociferous political statement, he decided that why not infuse that with his
123720	126300	natural talents, and brought us This is America.
126300	130660	The meticulously crafted creation impressed me on both a technical level and an interpretive
130660	131660	level.
131660	135220	As someone who really does enjoy artistry, I cannot express how much I appreciate the
135220	139240	detail of the subtext and imagery, too many artists just don't appreciate how much more
139240	141060	potent it can make your content.
141060	144900	I think that part of the appeal is the multitude of interpretations, and I'm glad that people
144900	148860	are discussing it, and hopefully it will inspire more profound conversation.
148860	153480	But nothing is sacred, and Nicole Arbour saw a chance to give it her own spin, well not
153480	157920	necessarily her own personal spin, but a women's spin, one from women's rights and highlighting
157920	160620	their maltreatment in modern American society.
160620	161620	How brave.
161780	165060	Now if you aren't familiar with me and the title of this video, you will be bracing
165060	168840	to what is an inevitable amount of criticism that is about to be thrown her way.
168840	173140	My opinion is that this is bad, very bad, I'd heard she'd responded to some of the
173140	176580	criticism, and when I read it she really did make a compelling case for her content.
176580	180620	And then I went and watched it again and reminded myself that actually it was pretty bad, and
180620	181620	it did deserve this video.
181620	185700	Due to the backlash she has subsequently disabled ratings and comments, but it wasn't well
185700	189380	received to say the least at first, with many people claiming she had completely butchered
189380	190700	what the original stood for.
190700	194660	How many have criticised her as making a cynical cash-in, riding on the coattails of something
194660	195660	so much better.
195660	199620	But I'm going to go into this video with an optimistic outlook of her character, the
199620	203980	right opinion is a pure heart, he believes in benefit of the doubt.
203980	205460	What a merciful soul I am.
205460	209000	I think the fact that she's white doesn't really undermine the message necessarily,
209000	212460	the validity of the statements about general issues are not dependent on who is saying
212460	216540	it, only statements about personal experience might be able to be judged on such a merit.
216540	221060	Though I have to say, I do find it quite weird out of everyone to make such a unique
221060	225180	commentary on the female American experience, it was a Canadian.
225180	229180	And let me make this clear, I think anyone can talk about politics from foreign countries,
229180	233780	I talk about American politics all the time, but this is so identifiably quintessentially
233780	237860	American, it seems exceptionally strange for her to come and speak about it herself.
237860	242260	However, as we will soon find out, Arbors version isn't really that American.
242260	246160	You are obviously going to be compared on many levels to the original, especially if
246160	250300	you try and draw parallels, which is what Nicole Arber attempts to do, so you better
250300	253520	make sure yours at least bangs, right?
253520	254520	Right.
254520	258000	I know a lot of people have memed it and laughed at it, and I've done that as well, a majority
258000	262100	of people do agree that it's pretty bad, but no one's tied down the little details that
262100	266280	in my opinion make it much more egregious than the mediocre offerings often presented
266280	268000	to us within musical wokeness.
268000	272200	I hope that today's video will not just provide a comprehensive criticism of the individual
272200	276400	question but also give some valuable lessons that everyone can take something away from
276400	277840	in critical thinking.
277840	282480	So today I'm going to be explaining my problems with Nicole Arber's musical magnum opus that
282480	287120	is known as This is America Women's Edit, and boy are you in for a treat.
287120	289280	Without further ado, let's get to it.
289280	293760	Let's discuss the premise, now when your video is titled This is America, what is the first
293760	295120	thing that comes to mind?
295120	296800	That this is America.
296800	299760	This video is going to be documenting the struggles that will make someone think of
299760	300760	that message.
300760	304280	Now in this instance, with regards to the original title, Childish Gambino made it quite
304280	307440	clear that there was a level of exclusivity to his statements.
307440	311880	With all these various coinciding messages, it created an image of something very specific
311880	317080	to America, maybe even being able to specify it to a specific indictment of media-driven
317080	321960	fantasy within America, and their relationship with the deeply impoverished reality of many
321960	327600	of its citizens, a juxtaposition whose magnitude is arguably very unique to the US.
327600	331200	But anyone who does copy the message has to at least use that template.
331200	333320	What do we get with Nicole Arber?
333320	336920	Well a string of messages that don't really come together at all, especially with regards
336920	337920	to America.
337920	342080	Let's try to break this down, now it's important to note that Nicole Arber clarifies the target
342080	346620	of the video as North America, to try and sidestep the inevitable criticism that she's
346620	349280	not from the states, and we'll address this response later.
349280	350440	So where can we start?
350440	355320	A high majority of the problems listed off by Nicole Arber are America, but there are
355320	358900	also a multitude of other countries across the world, so immediately the statement, this
358900	361480	is America, does not hold the same weight.
361480	364440	Let's break down some of the original messages, and have a gander.
364440	368320	She wrote a little Instagram post where she listed off all the topics that she was trying
368320	369320	to touch on.
369320	372420	I wanted to knock two on the head fairly immediately, the shaming of breastfeeding, I assume she
372420	374800	means public breastfeeding, and the gender pay gap.
374800	377680	Okay let's say these are problems, are they really America?
377680	381360	The stigma around breastfeeding exists throughout the world, and the gender pay gap is a very
381360	385120	complex question, and people haven't solved it not because they're not aware of it, but
385120	388600	because people don't agree on how to solve it, or even whether it needs to be solved
388600	389600	or not.
389600	393960	Bruce Hornsby did a song in 1987 called The Way It Is, smash hit, incredible piano work,
393960	397280	but it was also a statement about civil rights, and in it he makes the statement that although
397280	402100	civil rights laws have been established, some people will be racist and prejudice nonetheless,
402100	406080	because the law doesn't change in their minds, and that it is something that we should challenge
406080	410160	without a doubt, but it's a slow process, but the reason we haven't circumvented it
410160	413760	isn't because we don't know it exists, we completely get it.
413760	417780	With issues like this, if discrimination exists, the fact that both the rights of breastfeeding
417780	421340	and equal pay are protected by legislation makes the problem more difficult than just
421340	422340	noticing it.
422340	425760	You can't actively discriminate on the basis of gender, and you're allowed to publicly
425760	429840	breastfeed apart from in Idaho, so if you want to make a point about Idaho, then go
429840	430840	for it.
430840	434100	But for some reason, I don't think this is an open attack on Idaho.
434100	437360	Legislation isn't the problem necessarily, it's a mentality, it's the fact that some
437360	438920	people are still judgemental.
438920	442680	Now if you want to argue with them, then more power to you, but observing that it exists
442680	446560	is not an argument in itself, it'd be like me saying racism exists.
446560	448680	Okay, where's my fucking Nobel Peace Prize?
448680	452920	We've passed that stage Nicole, people have already developed their arguments on these
452920	455040	topics, you're decades behind.
455040	460360	And besides that, as I said, this is not just America, this is a multitude of cultures including
460360	464260	America, and yes, I know she included a specific case about cheerleaders, but that's almost
464260	468240	a red herring in a way, it's providing a specific example and therefore concluding
468240	471840	that the problem itself must be specific, which isn't the case, the problem will yield
471840	475880	many specific examples all over the world, but that does not undermine its generality.
475880	479800	Let's talk about sexual assault and harassment, two other topics that she touches on.
479800	482600	It would be crass to lump them in with the other two topics I just mentioned because
482600	486040	although they're also legislated against, they're a different type of issue, a much
486040	487360	more serious one.
487360	490260	Sexual harassment and assault are definitely women's issues, and we should definitely
490260	494460	be working to stem those issues, but once again, it's not necessarily a cultural phenomenon
494460	496560	and reports have been on the decline.
496560	500360	Criminal activity will always exist, it's just unfortunately given the matrices of power
500360	504720	passed on successive societies, the crimes are slanted against women in those subjects,
504720	507480	just like a majority of other crimes are slanted against men.
507480	511480	We shouldn't accept it by any means, but it's not stimulated solely in America.
511480	515280	Now at this point, some may argue that this is a point against a lot of childish Gambino's
515280	519680	points, and although not entirely incorrect, Gambino appears to be outlining an environment
519680	523680	that has cultivated the current predicament, and each individual general problem crafts
523680	527960	an individual image that is fairly specific to America, with its hysterical media almost
527960	532040	acting as a source of supernormal stimuli, detracting from the disturbing truth.
532040	536360	It is central to every problem that Gambino crafts, creating an image that although affecting
536360	539440	a general population, is very specific in its framework.
539440	543440	Arber seems to assort a load of problems, but none of them seem to go together to create
543440	547420	anything particularly coherent other than a collection of observations linked by the
547420	549280	fact that they're primarily women's issues.
549280	553920	And that's in part why message-wise, it fails so badly, not because she's necessarily white,
553920	556820	that's a lazy cop-out and it's allowed her to actually defend it.
556820	560680	It fails as an interpretation because it tries to parallel the message and fails.
560680	561820	Let me expand.
561820	565900	Why does West Side Story as an interpretation of Romeo and Juliet work?
565900	569720	Because it touches on the key elemental plot points that Romeo and Juliet set up and therefore
569720	571840	made it identifiable with the source material.
571840	575580	If it hadn't, it wouldn't have been an interpretation, it would have just been its own piece.
575580	578980	And that wouldn't have necessarily been a bad thing, but the worst possible combination
578980	583100	is when you so blatantly try to mirror the original by ripping the beat, the key hooks
583100	587500	and the phrases to the point of mimicry and yet in everything you change, you fail.
587500	592400	That's what Nicole Arber's done in the most atrocious, borderline insulting way possible.
592400	596140	That's not saying that you can't integrate source material into crafting a different
596140	597140	message.
597140	598140	Plenty of artists have done that.
598140	601980	Stan and Eminem sampling Dido's Thank You is an excellent example, but that worked because
601980	603580	it was totally consistent.
603580	607660	In this instance, the context provided with the original just shows up Arber's cover in
607660	609540	an even more embarrassing way.
609540	614460	When Charles Gambino crafts this greater message about social media, it is essential
614460	617780	to the song, to the point where if you removed it, the other messages from the song wouldn't
617780	618780	make sense.
618780	624100	Arber, yeah, she does mention social media, in her own words, social media on modern relationships
624100	625100	and self.
625100	628740	Now, if we are to try and unpack that vagueness in comparison, we can assume that with the
628740	633360	subtle symbolism, wink fucking wink, in the video that she is referring to the culture
633360	637700	of vanity and self-consciousness that seems more prevalent with females on social media,
637700	640820	perpetuated through unrealistic beauty standards.
640820	644260	With regards to social media on relationships, there isn't much to see in the video, although
644260	647820	I assume the handing out of hearts following the wedding is how relationships have evolved
647820	651660	from families to women seeking confirmation through guys and their social media hearts
651660	652940	rather than actual love.
652940	656300	You know the sort of thing that Hollywood thought it was trendy to point out in like
656300	657300	2010?
657300	660620	If I removed these two messages, nothing would change about the video.
660620	661620	They're not integral.
661620	666640	This is some of the most derivative, box-ticking activism in the face of one of the most multifaceted
666640	671960	artistic statements in a while, and its vapid, surface-level approach to the messages is
671960	673680	so transparent.
673680	675520	So, so transparent.
675520	680480	And now I wanted to talk about two other topics, which is apparently the labels and the pressures.
680480	681480	And yes, you know what?
681480	685960	It is a shame that society is judgmental sometimes, but it's so common you've probably done it
685960	687640	a fair few times yourself.
687640	690960	You ever look at a fat person and think, boy, why didn't they just lose some weight?
690960	692360	There's nothing stopping them.
692360	695440	Oh, wait, yes you did, and made a two-part series on it.
695440	696540	Why do we do that?
696540	697800	It's called heuristics.
697800	702120	We create certain stereotypes of characteristics that make it easier for us to judge people.
702120	706200	They're flawed mechanisms, but a lot of people use them nonetheless.
706200	710420	This was also addressed in a song called Follow Your Arrow by Kacey Musgraves a few years
710420	711420	ago.
711420	715040	An infinitely better song, which is much nicer on the ears as well, and it deals with the
715040	719980	issues of a judgmental society in a more compact, listenable, and nuanced way.
719980	723860	The issue is, as Musgraves points out, that most of us are going to be regularly exposed
723860	727960	to heuristics and stereotypes of what people think we're like, and yet in the chorus
727960	731640	she declares that you might as well just do whatever the fuck you want and do your best
731640	734240	to work with it, because people are always going to judge.
734240	737760	Now there are definitely gender-based judgments, but whether they're really slanted one way
737760	739080	that much is questionable.
739080	742920	Equality in this instance is a nice idea, but the only real equality you'll get between
742920	746640	demographics is when those within the demographics are equally as judgmental.
746640	749880	You'll never really eradicate it, but if you want to try, you should probably start to
749880	751280	practice what you preach.
751280	754220	You've already noticed that throughout this section I've chucked in various references
754220	756940	to other, and in my opinion, better music and art.
756940	758940	That's because there is nothing inspired here.
758940	762740	It's rehashed old content that would have been dated in its message a decade ago.
762740	766100	There are numerous artists who've dealt with this in a much more mature way and don't have
766100	770060	to fuck up another song in the process, and in doing so completely skewed its own message
770060	773880	because it failed to understand how connected the messages of the original were.
773880	777320	She couldn't even interpret it to make it culturally specific about the United States
777320	778320	of America.
778320	781940	Now if I was in this video rapping, we'll say North America, but none of this is remotely
781940	784300	unique from any South American country either.
784300	787740	You think they don't have literally every problem you've listed here in South America?
787740	792100	And if you tried this dirty to create an all-American image, a lot of Gambino's messages standalone
792100	796100	do not amount to specific scenarios, but the way he created a subtext that molded them
796100	800580	together makes the final image a lot more identifiable with the thesis statement.
800580	804620	That is not present in Arbor's version, and there is a lot to be said in its musical failures,
804620	806740	which is where we are fucking going next.
807600	811960	As I pointed out earlier, Arbor's song fails as an interpretation because she takes so
811960	816560	many of the devices used in the original but also tries to substitute elements that created
816560	818400	this incoherent mess.
818400	822480	But let's try to break down the specifics that aid the creation of such a failure, and
822480	826920	on a technical level where the flaws really come to showing why Nicole should maybe have
826920	828920	given this endeavor a break.
828920	830920	Let's compare the interpretation with the original.
830920	835800	One of the largest flaws in Nicole's version is that she relies on text over subtext.
835820	840740	A lot of what Childish Gambino's work focused on was that a very high majority of the lyrics
840740	845060	would not be out of place on any brag rap song, and therefore by contrasting them with
845060	849860	the grim reality of the connotations, it allows the message to be conveyed quite smartly.
849860	854580	Nicole rips many lines from Gambino's original, and therefore you'd need it to be consistent
854580	856700	with the balance of text to subtext.
856700	861700	However, a lot of the changes she makes tend to push towards surface-level text.
861700	866240	A really simple example of how it doesn't work is the switching of slipping for climbing
866240	867440	in the chorus.
867440	871540	In Gambino's song the line, Don't Catch You Slipping Now has an urgency of how an
871540	873880	individual may want to watch themselves.
873880	878720	One wrong move could cause dangerous repercussions, but the delivery almost revels in it.
878720	882720	Many rappers enjoy invoking the idea of fear over their enemies.
882720	886960	ABBA users don't catch you climbing up, as a statement about women's lack of social
886960	890860	mobility, but the issue there is that there is no subtext, people don't glorify the
890860	891860	glass ceiling.
891860	897240	Okay, so she changes it a bit, not a huge problem until you try to mimic the subtext.
897240	901480	In the original Gambino uses multiple lines with a lot of subtext, one example I could
901480	906200	extract is The Police Be Tripping Now, which to me is used to demonstrate how rappers often
906200	909820	mock the problems that don't affect them anymore, despite them purportedly remaining
909820	912120	prevalent within their former societies.
912120	915060	Nicole ABBA switches this and says The Boys Be Tripping Now.
915060	918960	Now firstly, in this moment it's already hard to identify subtext because many of the
918960	923620	issues she identifies in her Instagram don't necessarily go away with success, but it also
923620	926420	creates a very confusing contextual narrative.
926420	931340	Whereas Childish Gambino's rap portrays an unsettlingly ignorant caricature, Nicole
931340	935780	ABBA's characters regularly switches back and forth between Childish Gambino-esque mimicry
935780	939540	and just another activist pointing out these problems within society, at one point she
939540	943340	literally responds to her own observation going, what the fuck?
943340	947100	Creating this completely inconsistent narrative which is impossible to follow, it's really
947100	950680	fucking sloppy on a technical level, which even if what she was trying to say was new
950680	954360	or provocative, she'd have lost it in the delivery because she tried to nab certain
954360	959120	themes and abandon others, not realising that they were all complimentary to each other,
959120	961840	and as soon as you desert that, you end up with this.
961840	964000	What else can be said about this then?
964000	967020	Well, ABBA doesn't necessarily quite nail the delivery either.
967020	971000	In Gambino's the rapper recites his verses coldly with a very deadpan delivery which
971000	975480	often played contrast to his very flamboyant choreography, ABBA on the other hand is vocally
975480	979620	all over the place and I am aware that she is known for her exuberant performances but
979620	983640	by having such a hammy vocal delivery, it undermines whatever message was attempting
983640	984640	to be made.
984640	988480	She claims that the tone is tongue in cheek on her Instagram and maybe that would explain
988480	991900	the vocals but the issue is that it doesn't match anything else that she is trying to
991900	996860	do, changing your voice does not enhance the song, in fact the art of tongue in cheek content
996860	1001260	often requires some maintenance of the tone of the original, while creating surreal different
1001260	1005920	scenarios for that grounded tone to remain, rather than vice versa, and it certainly doesn't
1005920	1008480	work over something as dark as this.
1008480	1012280	Her singing vocals slapped all over the musical interludes are not done very well either,
1012280	1016240	Gambino's have clearly been very carefully placed with regards to the instrumentation,
1016240	1019580	the opening set of vocals are particularly well mixed, with the lyrics just creeping
1019580	1023520	through but drowned out in a sinister mix, it really creates this haunting atmosphere,
1023520	1027620	in ABBA's it just sounds like she's had a few too many vodkas before the studio session.
1027620	1031620	The instrumental has also been awkwardly changed, for some reason the dentist drill
1031620	1035920	synth is slathered on the top of the mix and it sounds extremely irritating, and for some
1035920	1039440	reason they've moved the propulsive bass line to the back of the mix, it honestly seems
1039440	1043320	like the producer hated this song as much as I do because anyone making those production
1043320	1047440	decisions did not do them out of love for this concoction, and yet all of these hail
1047440	1050920	in comparison to the last minute and a half of this song which is just awful, firstly
1050920	1059880	she says this, which is just diabolical, considering the context of the song and on
1059880	1063500	a technical level alone, she then proceeds to make a clumsily delivered line about the
1063500	1067240	Taliban before taking a moment to actually explain the reference, which is not something
1067240	1071980	you as an artist should ever do in the song unless it's to purposefully convey awkwardness,
1071980	1075460	which it doesn't, it just seems like she's worried that people may think it's a bad
1075460	1076860	line, which it is.
1076860	1081160	Then she does a tap dance, which I assume is her tongue in cheek interpretation of that
1081160	1086160	quirky childish Gambino moment, before following this with an outro reflecting Gambino's
1086160	1090080	video, the video finishes with the quote, if I were a guy, you wouldn't be asking
1090080	1094000	yourself, I wonder who wrote that, but I think we can say with a decent amount of confidence
1094000	1097720	that Nicole Arbour definitely wrote that, because heaven knows who else would consciously
1097720	1100600	attach their name to such a messy statement.
1100600	1104840	I'm being harsh, but this all comes across to me as incredibly lazy, hamfisted, and lacking
1104840	1107220	any sort of real investment from its performer.
1107220	1111100	Although I do concur with a lot of the original source material, I don't agree with every
1111100	1115000	single measure that I have derived from it, and I wouldn't expect to, but I do have
1115000	1119740	a hell of a lot of respect with how it works as an artistic statement, Arbour has no grip
1119740	1120740	of that.
1120740	1124300	Her content doesn't work as satire because the messages hold no weight and the humour
1124300	1128220	is dead, it doesn't work as a social statement because there is nothing more than observations
1128220	1132260	of problems that don't even tie into the supposed overarching narrative, it doesn't
1132260	1135880	work as a musical piece because the music isn't original and nowhere near as well
1135880	1140080	mixed as the original, and when you have so many other musicians making better crafted
1140080	1144600	social statements, why would you ever choose someone who basically uses a quote good cause
1144600	1146000	as a shield to make this?
1146000	1150060	And unfortunately, that's what a lot of people do, a lot of people think that marching
1150060	1154720	under a banner of righteousness will somehow alleviate criticism, but it should not, and
1154720	1158600	it won't round here, and I'm kind of relieved that of all people Nicole Arbour did it because
1158600	1162420	she's not very pally with anyone, but I still worry how many people criticise her
1162420	1167600	of this move on the basis of the very superficial factors, as if anyone else making the points
1167600	1173300	here would somehow improve the video, no, it is bad regardless, and it is time we put
1173300	1175020	it to bed.
1175020	1178620	In the Instagram response, Arbour says a fair few things that I would like to challenge,
1178620	1182200	I've already addressed her first few paragraphs fairly comprehensively, I don't think there's
1182200	1186300	any issue presenting your own take on This is America, but you have to nail down key
1186300	1191280	narrative anchors, and that's where I feel Arbour falls flat on her face in this instance,
1191280	1196180	she tries to make her post a message of positivity and empathy and kindness and talk about how
1196180	1199360	she believes the best thing to happen is to be able to record their own version of the
1199360	1204360	video and talk about their own personal experience, and I think that underlines how badly she's
1204360	1208160	missed the message of Gambino's video, the original touches on themes that although may
1208160	1212080	be affecting certain demographics more than others, is not a personal experience, it's
1212080	1216080	a greater cultural statement, you don't need This is America to talk about your own
1216080	1220380	personal experiences in America, there's always a musical platform to do that, so if
1220380	1223660	you do understand the core message of This is America, you should also understand that
1223660	1227320	it's not personal and doesn't need loads of people trying to make their own personalised
1227320	1230600	versions of it, because otherwise you're changing the context to the point where the
1230600	1234480	only things you're attaining are the title and the beats, the only way to remake new
1234480	1238480	interpretations of this would be to make it for different countries, and even then, you're
1238480	1243560	rocking a tightrope trying to avoid scrambling multiple coincided messages, the very carefully
1243560	1244560	weaved.
1244560	1247560	If you're going to change the message so much, then there's no point in using the
1247560	1249560	source as the foundation.
1249560	1254000	As I mentioned earlier, she drops in this notion of North America as some sort of deflection,
1254000	1258480	Arber is implying that this isn't about the US but more a collective problem in both the
1258480	1259480	US and Canada?
1259480	1263280	Firstly, if that's the case, you shouldn't have titled your video exactly the same as
1263280	1266680	the original, because everyone's going into it expecting reference to the United States
1266680	1267680	of America.
1267680	1271220	I get that you're equivocating it to the continent, but it's a pretty misleading equivocation
1271220	1272720	with the context provided.
1272720	1276520	Secondly, including Canada seems literally just a way to dodge the you're not American
1276520	1280800	criticism, it doesn't enhance the points, nor does it make it more unique when you include
1280800	1285160	Canada, and therefore the point is just lost in a seemingly rhetorical distraction device.
1285160	1288880	I'm all for empathy, I'm sure others will tell you Nicole that there is no gentleman
1288880	1293960	more empathetic than yours truly, but peace, love and positivity will not make a bad song
1294240	1303920	And this is often a problem with Nicole, she seems to make these arguments in the worst
1303920	1304920	way possible.
1304920	1309060	I've rewatched some of Nicole's more controversial videos, and although the core messages may
1309060	1313520	not be corrupted, they're delivered in such an assertive way that they undermine any notion
1313520	1318000	of empathy that she might want to get across, they're so directed that they make the subject
1318000	1322040	of the video defensive over their identity rather than attempting to listen to what she's
1322040	1323040	trying to say.
1323040	1327440	I have no doubt that people just saw some of her dear people videos and immediately
1327440	1330460	disliked because of the attitude that such a title radiates.
1330460	1334540	The controversy drowns out whatever message you claim to be promoting, rendering the message
1334540	1336020	itself pointless.
1336020	1340080	And even then, at least you could argue that those videos offered some sort of substantial
1340080	1341080	narrative.
1341080	1344640	This video just coasts off controversy over a message that is barely there, and certainly
1344640	1346480	nothing remotely thought provoking.
1346480	1349960	There are thousands of better ways you can raise awareness to your issues, and I do not
1349960	1351480	believe you're ignorant to them.
1351480	1354520	And therefore my verdict on your response is bullshit.
1354520	1358120	I don't care if you're offensive, controversial, so on.
1358120	1361840	Comedy is that sometimes, and I don't think we should ever sacrifice that, but if you
1361840	1365980	want to make decent social commentary within that comedy, in my opinion, you're not doing
1365980	1366980	it right.
1366980	1371320	This latest venture of This Is America is barely identifiable as comedy, I think most
1371320	1375400	people are still not 100% sure of what it's meant to be, and so in the end it just ends
1375400	1379880	up like a mess, and all it becomes identifiable for is its controversial premise which is
1379880	1384780	inevitably picked up by semi-famous commentators to explain why this song doesn't sound nice.
1384780	1388600	Which is fine, they can do that, but there's so many more layers of bad to this that it
1388600	1392220	had to be laid to rest, and hopefully that's what I've done to date.
1392220	1395960	If you care about learning, then the first thing you will do is learn that great content
1395960	1400680	takes time, and having a written, recorded, choreographed song out barely a week after
1400680	1404680	the original in such a half-baked manner does not reflect that philosophy, it seems like
1404680	1408680	a trending cash grab, and I'm not saying that's what you did, but that's how many
1408680	1413000	perceived it, and due to it they rejected your message altogether, which surely is not
1413000	1415200	what you want, correct?
1415200	1418960	Take home message, causes are important to people, if you want to see change in the world
1418960	1423240	more power to you, work for it, but do it gracefully and try to avoid appearing to piggyback
1423240	1427800	off other causes in the process, I don't believe a cause's validity necessarily hinges
1427800	1432120	on the proponents alone, and Abra is no prominent member of such a cause, but if she herself
1432120	1436040	cares about it she should care about how people may judge it, and I think that's what raises
1436040	1440260	red flags on her motivations, I think they are very justified red flags, the song itself
1440260	1444520	is uninspired and poorly written, showing a very surface level understanding of problems
1444520	1448760	relevant to our society, and it does not deserve a pass for its message alone, even if the
1448760	1453700	message was decent, which as I've discussed, is debatable, they're hardly problems relevant
1453700	1457440	in the way that the original presented them, and it rips narrative from the original while
1457440	1461760	introducing new elements that don't work either, I know a lot of people already hate
1461760	1465920	it, but hopefully I've given more of a justification for why people hate it, it's not just a
1465920	1470640	white vs black issue as Vice have portrayed it, but plenty more legitimate criticisms
1470640	1478800	that if you care, you won't ignore, otherwise, I think it's time we let this die, R.I.P.
1495920	1500200	fashion, though sometimes it does get a bit too toxic for me, admittedly, otherwise you
1500200	1504260	can reach me on facebook, you can reach me on twitter, I have open DMs, I tend to reply
1504260	1508240	to most people, also, I'm trying to be more active in my discord server though that is
1508240	1512760	currently failing, I will get there in the end, trust me on that one, otherwise I don't
1512760	1515840	think there's too much else to say, thanks for all your support of recent, it means a
1515840	1520440	lot, we're making great progress, at the time of recording this I just hit 20,000 subscribers
1520440	1524340	and it means a hell of a lot, I'm really trying hard to get these videos out, and hopefully
1524460	1528580	this one will be one that sees the light of day as well, until then however, I'm the
1528580	1530980	Right Opinion, and I'll see you, in the next one.
