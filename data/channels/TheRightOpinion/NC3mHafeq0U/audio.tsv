0	1600	It's pure madness.
1600	10000	Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too
10000	13680	much free time, and net neutrality not had the best week has it?
13680	17440	Yes, Ajit Pai, the big old twat end, finally got his hands on it and managed to pass a
17440	19960	vote to repeal it, 3-2 in the hearing.
19960	22920	This doesn't surprise me, because at the end of the day, nothing was going to budge
22920	26160	those commissioners, they were superglued to their position and you could tell that,
26160	30080	as an aside point I must say, that Ajit Pai is a bit of a rude knobhead.
30080	33600	Minion Clyburn made this really impassioned speech on the matter, and let me just show
33600	50600	you his response.
50600	54840	Which is my thoughts, bit unprofessional, but anyway, that part's all said and done
54840	55840	for now.
55840	59580	As many senators are raising their concerns, it will likely go to Congress, and if you
59580	62660	care about it then you should definitely give your congressmen a buzz to let them know how
62660	63660	you feel.
63660	66120	This video has been made to wrap up some loose ends that weren't quite addressed in my
66120	68660	last one, and I hope that I can do that sufficiently.
68660	71880	Since the vote there has been a lot of speculation about what the future could mean, even more
71880	72880	than before the vote.
72880	75960	I think that some of these outcomes have been blown out of proportion, I don't think that
75960	79720	certain websites will be sanctioned off, nor do I ever think you'll be paying for individual
79720	80720	tweets.
80720	83580	Also, all the people talking about how the repealment of net neutrality may affect certain
83580	87500	groups such as the LGBT community, even if you do have a point, the way you structure
87500	91120	it makes it sound like it's direct victimisation rather than just the collateral damage that
91120	92340	it would be construed as.
92340	95500	I state that it's important to not get too carried away with these arguments because
95500	99300	basically a lot of the anti-net neutrality journalists don't have any arguments beyond
99300	103800	HAHAHAHA look at these extremists, and listen, I'm not saying that there aren't decent points
103800	107900	of discourse for the whole debate, but the journalists see pointing out extremes as the
107900	111900	easiest way to represent their points because it's hard not to condemn someone making a
111900	113460	death threat for example.
113460	116780	And in a way, I have seen few people turned off to the whole fight for net neutrality
116780	120780	thing because this pro-net neutrality side has been a bit carried away at points.
120780	122260	I'm happy to admit that.
122260	125460	With that said, there's nothing wrong with pointing out genuine and truthful arguments,
125460	129380	and I had a few that I didn't mention in my last video, which I'm going to bring up now,
129380	133300	just so I can feel satisfied with being able to close the whole topic with nothing unsaid.
133300	136460	Speaking of these things that have been unsaid, do you know why people have been coming up
136460	139220	with these wacky conspiracy theories about what's going to happen?
139220	142020	Because people haven't been able to answer the hard question.
142020	145780	You ask Ajay Pai a question, and you might as well play FCC Commissioner Bingo, he'll
145780	149220	open with the word well, dodge the question and use the term free and open internet as
149220	153300	many times as possible, and also throw in the term light touch regulations a few times
153300	154300	too.
154300	157500	Probably in one of the most infamous interviews with PBS, when asked about paid prioritisation,
157500	161140	he said the situation is hypothetical, when presented with the evidence that it had happened
161140	165260	he then said, but it's rare, and then he said we should put our faith in fair trade regulations
165260	166260	now.
166260	169020	He is referring to the Fair Trade Commissions Act, but given the fact that a lot of the
169020	172440	times it has happened in the past, and underwhelming actions have been taken to say the least,
172440	176420	it doesn't instil people's faith, and given that no one can say with conviction the NISP
176420	180160	would be apprehended for partaking in such actions is not great either.
180160	183940	Also the fact that Comcast removed their no pay prioritisation pledge on the same day
183940	187940	the FCC announced their intentions, yeah, it was understandable that people were fairly
187940	188980	suspicious.
188980	192500	People haven't received enough information to say, okay, this possibility won't occur,
192500	193900	we can let this change happen.
193900	197780	In fact, when Comcast were pulling stunts like this, it compelled the very opposite.
197780	201460	All Ajit Pai had to do was assure people that some of these things that individuals
201460	206260	view as an overwhelming positive in this day and age will remain, and he could not do that.
206260	209780	All he could do is dress up as Santa with fidget spinners and kill an already fucking
209780	210780	dead meme.
210780	213380	Thank you Daily Caller for blessing us with that one.
213380	216860	What also doesn't help is the fact that online companies are so concerned about it.
216860	217980	Now what do I mean by that?
217980	221860	Well we understand that from hysteria people could misunderstand what's going on, and people
221860	225140	could be wrong, and in fact there is nothing that we should be worried about.
225140	229160	But the fact that so many sites oppose this, sites who employ people to be fully informed
229160	233500	on the status and the possible implications of such, is not a good sign, are these sites
233500	234500	mostly self-interested?
234500	238700	Definitely, but what happens to them will definitely have more of a public impact than
238700	241180	the current situation with the ISPs.
241180	245000	The lack of a convincing case and the uncertainty is partly due to the fact that Pai practically
245000	249700	wants to repeal Title 2 and then just pass on responsibility to the FTC, absolving them
249700	251700	of any consequence of what happens next.
251700	255060	I think it's a bewildering decision to do such a move in one, especially when you can't
255060	257820	make guarantees to an already judgemental public.
257820	259060	And that was the problem for me.
259060	263780	I am very anti-payee prioritisation, and even when I put all the crazy possibilities down
263780	267980	for one, I couldn't see anyone of authority or trust saying, this definitely won't happen
267980	268980	and here's why.
268980	272860	I don't put my faith in the law, especially in America, and there's this constant buzzword,
272860	276100	deregulation being thrown around, and I don't really understand the point.
276100	279940	From a sceptical perspective, which is the perspective that I have to take in this instance,
279940	284080	all we're doing is moving from the government's regulation of ISPs to the ISPs' regulation
284080	287720	of the internet, and there is just not enough to prove otherwise.
287720	291440	When even right-wing libertarians like Colin Moriarty are signalling their concern for
291440	296320	such a policy, everyone else has complete justification to be cynical towards such proposals.
296320	299520	As he put it, a complete upheaval just wasn't warranted enough.
299520	304080	Title 2 is far from perfect, but the solution in this circumstance wasn't to gut the whole
304080	307780	thing, and it's a shame that Pai couldn't do some light-touch framework of his own,
307780	310880	maybe the public would be a bit more permitting in that instance.
310880	314320	Whatever the outcome, people need to make sure that companies are held to account and
314320	316400	it doesn't just slip to the back of our minds.
316400	320080	Once again, there's still plenty more time, if you do feel strongly, let your congressman
320080	321080	know.
321080	323840	I feel like people don't utilise this more, and the fact that we are doing it this time
323840	327420	round is kinda cool, but now we're there we shouldn't let it be forgotten about.
327420	331880	Make sure they know what they're signing up to, and make sure they know where you stand.
331880	335820	This will likely be my final video on it for a while, unless any new developments occur.
335820	339240	Once again, I would love to hear your thoughts, though they may have already been stated in
339240	340240	previous videos.
340240	343160	Nonetheless, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
