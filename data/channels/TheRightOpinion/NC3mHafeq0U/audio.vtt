00:00.000 --> 00:01.600
It's pure madness.

00:01.600 --> 00:10.000
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too

00:10.000 --> 00:13.680
much free time, and net neutrality not had the best week has it?

00:13.680 --> 00:17.440
Yes, Ajit Pai, the big old twat end, finally got his hands on it and managed to pass a

00:17.440 --> 00:19.960
vote to repeal it, 3-2 in the hearing.

00:19.960 --> 00:22.920
This doesn't surprise me, because at the end of the day, nothing was going to budge

00:22.920 --> 00:26.160
those commissioners, they were superglued to their position and you could tell that,

00:26.160 --> 00:30.080
as an aside point I must say, that Ajit Pai is a bit of a rude knobhead.

00:30.080 --> 00:33.600
Minion Clyburn made this really impassioned speech on the matter, and let me just show

00:33.600 --> 00:50.600
you his response.

00:50.600 --> 00:54.840
Which is my thoughts, bit unprofessional, but anyway, that part's all said and done

00:54.840 --> 00:55.840
for now.

00:55.840 --> 00:59.580
As many senators are raising their concerns, it will likely go to Congress, and if you

00:59.580 --> 01:02.660
care about it then you should definitely give your congressmen a buzz to let them know how

01:02.660 --> 01:03.660
you feel.

01:03.660 --> 01:06.120
This video has been made to wrap up some loose ends that weren't quite addressed in my

01:06.120 --> 01:08.660
last one, and I hope that I can do that sufficiently.

01:08.660 --> 01:11.880
Since the vote there has been a lot of speculation about what the future could mean, even more

01:11.880 --> 01:12.880
than before the vote.

01:12.880 --> 01:15.960
I think that some of these outcomes have been blown out of proportion, I don't think that

01:15.960 --> 01:19.720
certain websites will be sanctioned off, nor do I ever think you'll be paying for individual

01:19.720 --> 01:20.720
tweets.

01:20.720 --> 01:23.580
Also, all the people talking about how the repealment of net neutrality may affect certain

01:23.580 --> 01:27.500
groups such as the LGBT community, even if you do have a point, the way you structure

01:27.500 --> 01:31.120
it makes it sound like it's direct victimisation rather than just the collateral damage that

01:31.120 --> 01:32.340
it would be construed as.

01:32.340 --> 01:35.500
I state that it's important to not get too carried away with these arguments because

01:35.500 --> 01:39.300
basically a lot of the anti-net neutrality journalists don't have any arguments beyond

01:39.300 --> 01:43.800
HAHAHAHA look at these extremists, and listen, I'm not saying that there aren't decent points

01:43.800 --> 01:47.900
of discourse for the whole debate, but the journalists see pointing out extremes as the

01:47.900 --> 01:51.900
easiest way to represent their points because it's hard not to condemn someone making a

01:51.900 --> 01:53.460
death threat for example.

01:53.460 --> 01:56.780
And in a way, I have seen few people turned off to the whole fight for net neutrality

01:56.780 --> 02:00.780
thing because this pro-net neutrality side has been a bit carried away at points.

02:00.780 --> 02:02.260
I'm happy to admit that.

02:02.260 --> 02:05.460
With that said, there's nothing wrong with pointing out genuine and truthful arguments,

02:05.460 --> 02:09.380
and I had a few that I didn't mention in my last video, which I'm going to bring up now,

02:09.380 --> 02:13.300
just so I can feel satisfied with being able to close the whole topic with nothing unsaid.

02:13.300 --> 02:16.460
Speaking of these things that have been unsaid, do you know why people have been coming up

02:16.460 --> 02:19.220
with these wacky conspiracy theories about what's going to happen?

02:19.220 --> 02:22.020
Because people haven't been able to answer the hard question.

02:22.020 --> 02:25.780
You ask Ajay Pai a question, and you might as well play FCC Commissioner Bingo, he'll

02:25.780 --> 02:29.220
open with the word well, dodge the question and use the term free and open internet as

02:29.220 --> 02:33.300
many times as possible, and also throw in the term light touch regulations a few times

02:33.300 --> 02:34.300
too.

02:34.300 --> 02:37.500
Probably in one of the most infamous interviews with PBS, when asked about paid prioritisation,

02:37.500 --> 02:41.140
he said the situation is hypothetical, when presented with the evidence that it had happened

02:41.140 --> 02:45.260
he then said, but it's rare, and then he said we should put our faith in fair trade regulations

02:45.260 --> 02:46.260
now.

02:46.260 --> 02:49.020
He is referring to the Fair Trade Commissions Act, but given the fact that a lot of the

02:49.020 --> 02:52.440
times it has happened in the past, and underwhelming actions have been taken to say the least,

02:52.440 --> 02:56.420
it doesn't instil people's faith, and given that no one can say with conviction the NISP

02:56.420 --> 03:00.160
would be apprehended for partaking in such actions is not great either.

03:00.160 --> 03:03.940
Also the fact that Comcast removed their no pay prioritisation pledge on the same day

03:03.940 --> 03:07.940
the FCC announced their intentions, yeah, it was understandable that people were fairly

03:07.940 --> 03:08.980
suspicious.

03:08.980 --> 03:12.500
People haven't received enough information to say, okay, this possibility won't occur,

03:12.500 --> 03:13.900
we can let this change happen.

03:13.900 --> 03:17.780
In fact, when Comcast were pulling stunts like this, it compelled the very opposite.

03:17.780 --> 03:21.460
All Ajit Pai had to do was assure people that some of these things that individuals

03:21.460 --> 03:26.260
view as an overwhelming positive in this day and age will remain, and he could not do that.

03:26.260 --> 03:29.780
All he could do is dress up as Santa with fidget spinners and kill an already fucking

03:29.780 --> 03:30.780
dead meme.

03:30.780 --> 03:33.380
Thank you Daily Caller for blessing us with that one.

03:33.380 --> 03:36.860
What also doesn't help is the fact that online companies are so concerned about it.

03:36.860 --> 03:37.980
Now what do I mean by that?

03:37.980 --> 03:41.860
Well we understand that from hysteria people could misunderstand what's going on, and people

03:41.860 --> 03:45.140
could be wrong, and in fact there is nothing that we should be worried about.

03:45.140 --> 03:49.160
But the fact that so many sites oppose this, sites who employ people to be fully informed

03:49.160 --> 03:53.500
on the status and the possible implications of such, is not a good sign, are these sites

03:53.500 --> 03:54.500
mostly self-interested?

03:54.500 --> 03:58.700
Definitely, but what happens to them will definitely have more of a public impact than

03:58.700 --> 04:01.180
the current situation with the ISPs.

04:01.180 --> 04:05.000
The lack of a convincing case and the uncertainty is partly due to the fact that Pai practically

04:05.000 --> 04:09.700
wants to repeal Title 2 and then just pass on responsibility to the FTC, absolving them

04:09.700 --> 04:11.700
of any consequence of what happens next.

04:11.700 --> 04:15.060
I think it's a bewildering decision to do such a move in one, especially when you can't

04:15.060 --> 04:17.820
make guarantees to an already judgemental public.

04:17.820 --> 04:19.060
And that was the problem for me.

04:19.060 --> 04:23.780
I am very anti-payee prioritisation, and even when I put all the crazy possibilities down

04:23.780 --> 04:27.980
for one, I couldn't see anyone of authority or trust saying, this definitely won't happen

04:27.980 --> 04:28.980
and here's why.

04:28.980 --> 04:32.860
I don't put my faith in the law, especially in America, and there's this constant buzzword,

04:32.860 --> 04:36.100
deregulation being thrown around, and I don't really understand the point.

04:36.100 --> 04:39.940
From a sceptical perspective, which is the perspective that I have to take in this instance,

04:39.940 --> 04:44.080
all we're doing is moving from the government's regulation of ISPs to the ISPs' regulation

04:44.080 --> 04:47.720
of the internet, and there is just not enough to prove otherwise.

04:47.720 --> 04:51.440
When even right-wing libertarians like Colin Moriarty are signalling their concern for

04:51.440 --> 04:56.320
such a policy, everyone else has complete justification to be cynical towards such proposals.

04:56.320 --> 04:59.520
As he put it, a complete upheaval just wasn't warranted enough.

04:59.520 --> 05:04.080
Title 2 is far from perfect, but the solution in this circumstance wasn't to gut the whole

05:04.080 --> 05:07.780
thing, and it's a shame that Pai couldn't do some light-touch framework of his own,

05:07.780 --> 05:10.880
maybe the public would be a bit more permitting in that instance.

05:10.880 --> 05:14.320
Whatever the outcome, people need to make sure that companies are held to account and

05:14.320 --> 05:16.400
it doesn't just slip to the back of our minds.

05:16.400 --> 05:20.080
Once again, there's still plenty more time, if you do feel strongly, let your congressman

05:20.080 --> 05:21.080
know.

05:21.080 --> 05:23.840
I feel like people don't utilise this more, and the fact that we are doing it this time

05:23.840 --> 05:27.420
round is kinda cool, but now we're there we shouldn't let it be forgotten about.

05:27.420 --> 05:31.880
Make sure they know what they're signing up to, and make sure they know where you stand.

05:31.880 --> 05:35.820
This will likely be my final video on it for a while, unless any new developments occur.

05:35.820 --> 05:39.240
Once again, I would love to hear your thoughts, though they may have already been stated in

05:39.240 --> 05:40.240
previous videos.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.160
Nonetheless, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
