1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
It's pure madness.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,680
much free time, and net neutrality not had the best week has it?

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,440
Yes, Ajit Pai, the big old twat end, finally got his hands on it and managed to pass a

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,960
vote to repeal it, 3-2 in the hearing.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,920
This doesn't surprise me, because at the end of the day, nothing was going to budge

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,160
those commissioners, they were superglued to their position and you could tell that,

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,080
as an aside point I must say, that Ajit Pai is a bit of a rude knobhead.

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,600
Minion Clyburn made this really impassioned speech on the matter, and let me just show

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:50,600
you his response.

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,840
Which is my thoughts, bit unprofessional, but anyway, that part's all said and done

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
for now.

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,580
As many senators are raising their concerns, it will likely go to Congress, and if you

14
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,660
care about it then you should definitely give your congressmen a buzz to let them know how

15
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,660
you feel.

16
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,120
This video has been made to wrap up some loose ends that weren't quite addressed in my

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,660
last one, and I hope that I can do that sufficiently.

18
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,880
Since the vote there has been a lot of speculation about what the future could mean, even more

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,880
than before the vote.

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,960
I think that some of these outcomes have been blown out of proportion, I don't think that

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,720
certain websites will be sanctioned off, nor do I ever think you'll be paying for individual

22
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,720
tweets.

23
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,580
Also, all the people talking about how the repealment of net neutrality may affect certain

24
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,500
groups such as the LGBT community, even if you do have a point, the way you structure

25
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,120
it makes it sound like it's direct victimisation rather than just the collateral damage that

26
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,340
it would be construed as.

27
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,500
I state that it's important to not get too carried away with these arguments because

28
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,300
basically a lot of the anti-net neutrality journalists don't have any arguments beyond

29
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,800
HAHAHAHA look at these extremists, and listen, I'm not saying that there aren't decent points

30
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,900
of discourse for the whole debate, but the journalists see pointing out extremes as the

31
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,900
easiest way to represent their points because it's hard not to condemn someone making a

32
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,460
death threat for example.

33
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,780
And in a way, I have seen few people turned off to the whole fight for net neutrality

34
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,780
thing because this pro-net neutrality side has been a bit carried away at points.

35
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,260
I'm happy to admit that.

36
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,460
With that said, there's nothing wrong with pointing out genuine and truthful arguments,

37
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,380
and I had a few that I didn't mention in my last video, which I'm going to bring up now,

38
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,300
just so I can feel satisfied with being able to close the whole topic with nothing unsaid.

39
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,460
Speaking of these things that have been unsaid, do you know why people have been coming up

40
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,220
with these wacky conspiracy theories about what's going to happen?

41
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,020
Because people haven't been able to answer the hard question.

42
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,780
You ask Ajay Pai a question, and you might as well play FCC Commissioner Bingo, he'll

43
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,220
open with the word well, dodge the question and use the term free and open internet as

44
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,300
many times as possible, and also throw in the term light touch regulations a few times

45
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,300
too.

46
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,500
Probably in one of the most infamous interviews with PBS, when asked about paid prioritisation,

47
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,140
he said the situation is hypothetical, when presented with the evidence that it had happened

48
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,260
he then said, but it's rare, and then he said we should put our faith in fair trade regulations

49
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,260
now.

50
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,020
He is referring to the Fair Trade Commissions Act, but given the fact that a lot of the

51
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,440
times it has happened in the past, and underwhelming actions have been taken to say the least,

52
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,420
it doesn't instil people's faith, and given that no one can say with conviction the NISP

53
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,160
would be apprehended for partaking in such actions is not great either.

54
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,940
Also the fact that Comcast removed their no pay prioritisation pledge on the same day

55
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,940
the FCC announced their intentions, yeah, it was understandable that people were fairly

56
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,980
suspicious.

57
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,500
People haven't received enough information to say, okay, this possibility won't occur,

58
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,900
we can let this change happen.

59
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,780
In fact, when Comcast were pulling stunts like this, it compelled the very opposite.

60
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,460
All Ajit Pai had to do was assure people that some of these things that individuals

61
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:26,260
view as an overwhelming positive in this day and age will remain, and he could not do that.

62
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,780
All he could do is dress up as Santa with fidget spinners and kill an already fucking

63
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,780
dead meme.

64
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,380
Thank you Daily Caller for blessing us with that one.

65
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,860
What also doesn't help is the fact that online companies are so concerned about it.

66
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,980
Now what do I mean by that?

67
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,860
Well we understand that from hysteria people could misunderstand what's going on, and people

68
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,140
could be wrong, and in fact there is nothing that we should be worried about.

69
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,160
But the fact that so many sites oppose this, sites who employ people to be fully informed

70
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,500
on the status and the possible implications of such, is not a good sign, are these sites

71
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
mostly self-interested?

72
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,700
Definitely, but what happens to them will definitely have more of a public impact than

73
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,180
the current situation with the ISPs.

74
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,000
The lack of a convincing case and the uncertainty is partly due to the fact that Pai practically

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,700
wants to repeal Title 2 and then just pass on responsibility to the FTC, absolving them

76
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,700
of any consequence of what happens next.

77
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,060
I think it's a bewildering decision to do such a move in one, especially when you can't

78
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,820
make guarantees to an already judgemental public.

79
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,060
And that was the problem for me.

80
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,780
I am very anti-payee prioritisation, and even when I put all the crazy possibilities down

81
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,980
for one, I couldn't see anyone of authority or trust saying, this definitely won't happen

82
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,980
and here's why.

83
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,860
I don't put my faith in the law, especially in America, and there's this constant buzzword,

84
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,100
deregulation being thrown around, and I don't really understand the point.

85
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,940
From a sceptical perspective, which is the perspective that I have to take in this instance,

86
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,080
all we're doing is moving from the government's regulation of ISPs to the ISPs' regulation

87
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,720
of the internet, and there is just not enough to prove otherwise.

88
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,440
When even right-wing libertarians like Colin Moriarty are signalling their concern for

89
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,320
such a policy, everyone else has complete justification to be cynical towards such proposals.

90
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,520
As he put it, a complete upheaval just wasn't warranted enough.

91
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,080
Title 2 is far from perfect, but the solution in this circumstance wasn't to gut the whole

92
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,780
thing, and it's a shame that Pai couldn't do some light-touch framework of his own,

93
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,880
maybe the public would be a bit more permitting in that instance.

94
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,320
Whatever the outcome, people need to make sure that companies are held to account and

95
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,400
it doesn't just slip to the back of our minds.

96
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,080
Once again, there's still plenty more time, if you do feel strongly, let your congressman

97
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
know.

98
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,840
I feel like people don't utilise this more, and the fact that we are doing it this time

99
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,420
round is kinda cool, but now we're there we shouldn't let it be forgotten about.

100
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,880
Make sure they know what they're signing up to, and make sure they know where you stand.

101
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,820
This will likely be my final video on it for a while, unless any new developments occur.

102
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,240
Once again, I would love to hear your thoughts, though they may have already been stated in

103
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,240
previous videos.

104
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,160
Nonetheless, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
