0	10680	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,
10680	17880	and as I'm sure many of you know, I am a gamer. It is a bonafide fact at this point. From my early period throwing knife
17880	25720	montages, to my entourage on GTA 5, my gaming skills are seldom equalled, and certainly not by anyone who I am covering today.
25840	33440	I am the epic gamer your parents tell you about, so you better hide your wife, and in true gamer fashion, we are going back to the world of video games,
33440	40320	with one of my most requested topics of all time, and that topic is Yandere Simulator, an anime based game.
40320	45720	Ah, anime, my favourite. What do people who like anime talk about?
45720	54360	Hello fellow anime watchers, uwu? I'm gonna level with you guys here. One of my most commonly asked questions is if I watch anime,
54360	61800	and although I have seen a couple movies when I was younger, Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, I haven't really had the chance to enjoy much of it.
61800	66840	Although I have heard great things, and I really do respect the art, some of it looks truly beautiful.
66840	74960	Now, anime has been relatively popular since the early 20th century, it obviously originated in Japan, and often represented the cultural zeitgeist.
74960	83000	The development of digital mediums has allowed the art to flourish and expand into new genres. One of those, of course, is the video game genre.
83040	92440	There are many anime video games, and it was in the video game heyday of the 1980s that anime inspired video games and video game inspired animes rose to prominence.
92440	100640	Since then, their popularity has continued to extend beyond their borders, with the style attaining international prestige amongst a variety of audiences.
100640	108120	I also want to take a moment to talk about manga, which is typically used to refer to comics and graphic novels, often created in the Japanese style.
108120	114280	Manga precedes anime, and although mangas may be made reflecting an anime style, they are by no means the same.
114280	119680	However, there is overlap, and that overlap can be demonstrated in many characterisations.
119680	121680	This is where we meet the yandere.
130680	136520	Yandere is a portmanteau, which is our word of the day, of the words yandere and dere dere.
136560	140880	Yandere meaning sick, and dere dere meaning infatuated, deeply in love.
140880	151160	So combined, you reach the lovely idea that a person is in love to a sick extent, they will do anything for their senpai, even if that means often less than charitable activities.
151160	160440	This personality trait is attributed to manga characters, however, it has gained popularity in anime as well, with many characters being modelled around that mould.
160440	168560	The psychotic behaviour, often paired with a cute design, and sometimes demeanour, seems to be a good contrast that has become quite the rave,
168560	177760	but it wasn't until one very cheeky game developer had a very cheeky idea, how about we make a whole video game from the perspective of a yandere.
177760	185320	That cheeky game developer was a person by the name of Alex Mahan, currently operating under the very fitting name of Yandere Dev.
185320	192200	He was an independent developer hailing from California, he has a degree in animation, and was previously known under the name Iba Zifon,
192200	198600	where he'd worked on the game of Lunar Scythe, however, in spite of receiving some initial interest within forums, it didn't come to fruition.
198600	205240	That was previously his most renowned project, but he has been a resident of the online world since the mid to late 2000s, working on various concepts.
205240	211880	One I found was a game called Shader, lots and lots of fun. It appears that Yandere Dev was a man with many ideas,
211920	216160	so let's talk about the idea that has brought us to this titular game.
216160	223400	He conceived the idea of Yandere Simulator in 2014, pitched it to the internet, and allegedly, after receiving positive feedback,
223400	228480	decided to initiate development starting a YouTube channel to document this development and progress.
228480	235000	The YouTube channel, like all channels, was a bit slow at first, but in perspective gained subscribers at a relatively rapid pace,
235000	239200	catapulting his content and the respective project into the public eye.
239240	247560	It wasn't too long before other large creators gave the game a burst of publicity, including PewDiePie, Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, and IHAS Cupquake.
247560	253800	Given its accessibility, even in the early stage of development, Yandere Simulator was pushed towards the spotlight,
253800	261000	and although it was not remotely near finished, many were more than willing to let this slide, considering that it was an independently funded venture.
261000	268120	And sometimes, true quality does indeed take time. He would typically upload content that would provide updates and ideas,
268120	272280	and was interactive on social media. However, it was a lot to do for one person.
272280	279640	With this in mind, in 2014, Yandere Dev also set up a Patreon to support this endeavour, and it gained a reasonable amount of donors,
279640	285960	at one point totalling $5,000 a month. With the production in full motion, new ideas ready to be worked on,
285960	290280	plenty of traction and support from the community members, and even the odd volunteer along the way,
290280	296800	everything seemed to be going perfectly fine. However, if it was a perfect story, we wouldn't be here today.
298280	305560	If you went by his YouTube channel, it's unlikely you'd see many issues. Yandere Dev has now amassed over 2.6 million subscribers,
305560	312720	his content appears to receive universally positive feedback from his audience, and his subreddit is a place of joy and epic anime memes.
312720	318680	But this hasn't changed the fact that there have been many videos equally well received, dishing out some hard hitting criticism,
318680	322280	and numerous threads outside of the Yandere Dev chamber.
323240	328680	You see, our friend Alex here seemed to have a lot of creative ideas, which definitely gave hope to the project on principle.
328680	334120	However, as time passed, in spite of the notion that these ideas were receiving support, many began to become frustrated
334120	339720	with the lack of progress being made on the game. One year passed, two years passed, three years passed,
339720	345000	four years passed, and people didn't feel like they were seeing results. Now, many games take a long time,
345000	350600	and with one developer, it was obviously not expected to be completed too quickly. Rome wasn't built in a day.
350600	357800	However, many began to challenge whether this project was comparable to Rome, or whether it was more of a, well, Pompeii,
357800	363880	with criticisms going after his management, development, and even basic ability in the pursuit of his vision.
364760	370360	There were a diversity of criticisms to cover on this front, but many also claim that Yandere Dev's response
370360	375400	was regularly documented to be lacking the filter that many creators may have when dealing with criticism.
375400	379960	This led to additional criticism for his demeanour and attitude, with many stating that his hostility,
379960	386280	and often censorious response to criticism, shows an arrogant and entitled side to him that he hadn't earned yet.
386280	391960	Others who defended him said his responses were just those by an individual under a lot of pressure to deliver a game
391960	397160	that has been weighing on him for a long time. Add this to a load of other drama regarding attitude and treatment
397160	402920	of those around him, responses, alleged harassment, all escalating in severity, and you ended up with a very messy
402920	409960	case indeed that came to a head in the year of 2018. If you're confused, don't worry, I'll do my best to get through all of it,
409960	412280	and maybe we'll make some more friends along the way.
412280	418680	Full disclosure, Faf9, my good collaborator friend, put out this tweet, which did significantly well in the
418680	424120	Twittersphere, and in a reply, he then stated that I was making this video, which led both Yandere Dev,
424120	429560	and a prominent critic of his to reach out to me. Overall, they had quite little impact on my script,
429560	434200	but as always, I will put it out there, and I will clarify that unless you're someone like Austin Jones,
434200	438520	I'm not here to bite your head off. There's going to be a lot of criticisms and opinions from me,
438520	444120	but as always, I encourage everyone to form their own. I'd also stress that some of this criticism is retrospective,
444120	449400	you'll know by the tense I use. There is no guarantee that individuals involved feel the same today about a lot of these things,
449400	454360	but these incidents have had a butterfly effect onto the current situation, and thus cannot be ignored.
455080	459960	Let's talk about the video game that was almost completely derailed by internet drama.
459960	462760	Ladies and gentlemen, it's Game Time.
465800	471880	Given that the root of this video is the game, and the origins, I think it's most appropriate that we begin there.
471880	476600	Yandere Simulator as a concept was conceived around the 2014 period.
476600	482040	Now at first, Yandere Dev was a one man band, working on the project. He may have had a lot of drive,
482040	487240	it's hard to tell completely. In a late 2014 interview with TechRaptor, he seemed to be pretty motivated.
487240	491560	He had some decent ideas of what he wanted to do with the game, even if they weren't fully realized,
491560	497480	but you don't exactly need them to be at that point. He also appeared to genuinely enjoy interactions with his audience
497480	502600	over the delightful medium of emails, stating that it filled him with joy. At the end of the interview,
502600	507080	he committed to making a game that would fulfill expectations and not let anyone down,
507080	509160	but that is easier said than done.
509160	515000	Projects on a large scale are always a challenge to an extent. You would inevitably go through periods of high and low
515000	521240	motivation. Developing a game is never an easy process, however, there are also things you can do to facilitate
521240	526920	the development of a game to maximize the efficiency, and to make sure you're able to turn out high quality
526920	532600	product in good time, without being sidetracked by menial issues. These are all important aspects of management
532600	538440	without even considering PR. PR meaning that you need to build hype, and turn out content that eventually
538440	543560	justifies the hype. Now, Yandere Simulator is clearly a neat concept that is popular with many people,
543560	549400	but it's also just a game, and given the fact that the developer hasn't exactly released any other acclaimed work
549400	555640	for people to build off, in spite of its popularity, a trust in this developer and his ability to deliver a game
555640	561240	has to be earned. With the almost immediate success of Yandere Dev, on principle, it seemed like there was a lot
561240	566600	to celebrate. When a concept is popular and takes off, you have a lot of momentum, and a lot of people and
566600	572040	businesses wanting to provide their services, however, if you're not prepared for this success, then it can yield
572040	578200	many problems for anyone. Probably one of the best examples of this is child stars. Now, children need to be
578200	583480	represented in media to an extent, and many of them deal with it reasonably well, however, for those who have been
583480	589080	thrown into the spotlight at such a young age, whether it was due to a hit song or an iconic film performance,
589080	594520	many don't deal with the sudden spotlight and pressure too well, many end up in rather uncharitable places.
594520	600920	In many instances, it's the case of peaking so early and having so much pressure to maintain that, in other cases,
600920	606920	it's simply not being prepared for the responsibility the success brings. Although Yandere Dev is by no means
606920	612840	what one would consider a child star, the Yandere Simulator's spontaneous success was somewhat equatable,
612840	618280	and I don't think Yandere Dev was remotely ready for what it meant, not just as a creator, but as the
618280	625640	developer of a game. Although the 2014 origin was pretty relaxed, 2015 was met with a huge spike in attention,
625640	632040	with the aforementioned creators showcasing the game to millions of fans. Publicity can be premature,
632040	639160	and for Yandere Simulator, it was, let me explain why. As noted, the build-up of a game is partly about hype.
639160	643720	Typically, the discovery of a new game or a new piece of media will lead to a process where we either
643720	650040	discard that discovery and leave it behind, or we become more invested, and we fall down whatever rabbit hole that game has.
650040	655800	Nonetheless, it's unlikely our venture down that rabbit hole will last forever. Eventually, we will hit a wall where we can
655800	661400	no longer find any new information, and the information that we already know no longer engages us.
661400	668200	For some people, this takes longer than others, and in a way, that's alright. Now, when we hit that wall, we have one of two responses.
668200	674120	We can leave the source of what we know behind and continue with our lives, destined to fall down another rabbit hole eventually,
674120	679640	or we can try and obtain new information, by either creating it ourselves, or trying to get it from the creator.
679640	685640	This is often represented by the sentiment of impatience. I'll return to that soon, however, I want to make the point that although
685640	691640	Yandere Simulator was an interesting concept, and it was great that Yandere Dev had a lot of support in developing it initially,
691640	696600	Yandere Simulator wasn't developed enough to be deserving of the publicity it received.
696600	702600	Yandere Dev had very ambitious ideas for the game. At the time of the game, although you could roam around and do a few actions,
702600	707400	some of which were fairly brutal and amusing in their shock value, there was no deeper substance.
707400	715320	This meant the game built hype almost immediately, yet off the back of mostly very superficial elements that wouldn't keep people engaged for a prolonged period.
715320	721800	With the hype and the influx of new donors on the Patreon, Yandere Dev felt the pressure to maintain that hype, but as said,
721800	728040	it's equally a PR job as it is a developer's job, so he liked to document progress, which is a time consuming venture.
728040	735240	In the short term, this was a sensible decision to make, but it could only work out long term if the decisions that he made were backed by his ability.
735240	742600	The decisions you make early on in the development of a game can have long term effects at a later stage, you're setting the foundations.
742600	751480	On top of this, as documented in a later video, any possible overhaul of the game seemed troublesome because the Dev was worried that doing that would kill the hype.
751480	758840	The game is only alive for as long as people are interested in it. If people lose interest in the game, it's dead.
758840	770600	If I release frequent updates, people will remain interested in the game. If I release updates slowly, people will lose interest in the game, and the game will get closer to death.
770600	777320	Given that So Made People had experienced the game in some capacity, he clearly saw it as a challenge to revive the hype if he lost it.
777320	782360	On the surface, Made People would just see him as trying to resell the same product, and wouldn't buy.
782360	790440	I'm not going to go into complete depth regarding why his decision to continuously work on the project, since to maintain hype was eventually what has fundamentally crippled it,
790440	798120	will cross that bridge when we reach it. However, as is inevitable, eventually, even if you're adding content, if there is no clear compilation of a plotline,
798120	805080	or overarching concept that people feel satisfied with, they will begin to become frustrated. Results are important.
805080	811960	This was a huge problem for Yandere Dev, as he clearly prioritised certain components, that although may have provided progress in the moment,
811960	819800	didn't necessarily provide the feeling of progress to his audience, particularly regarding the rivals, which to many was a significant selling point.
819800	825640	Many people began to hone in on the fact that they didn't feel that Yandere Simulator was making the progress that it should have,
825640	832680	with focus being overly centred on Tribual Matters and Easter Eggs. This led to a basically placebo-ed sentiment to progress.
832760	840040	The project felt like it was moving forward, but not in the ways that people would want it to, and by 2016, people were becoming restless,
840040	844920	not just in the game's development, but in Yandere Dev's responses to these frustrations.
844920	848040	How did he handle them? Well, let's talk about it.
848920	866520	Now, Yandere Dev is an interesting person. His past shows that he was never the most socially apt, and when you watch his videos,
866520	873960	you receive the impression that he isn't a massive, people-loving extrovert, so it's clear that he wasn't used to this level of positive attention.
873960	881160	What this can do to a person is often varied, but given that he was always a bit of an oddball, the outcome wasn't exactly favourable.
881160	887640	It's hard to say exactly where the switch was flipped, but at any point the feedback he received was no longer universally positive,
887640	894120	he just stopped taking it with the decorum that one might expect him to, and when questions started being asked, they looked to you to answer,
894120	900760	and let's just say he didn't exactly provide the desired responses. Arrogant is a word I see used a lot, and honestly,
900760	908520	I completely understand why a lot of people had that opinion. Particularly in 2016, there are multiple screenshots of him being incredibly short-tempered,
908520	915960	with people who were making inoffensive to good faith criticism. He likes to use the word stupid a lot when describing anything he doesn't like,
915960	921800	which in the wrong context can come across as rather superior, he would regularly clash with fans and critics alike.
921800	929400	There was one situation where a fan was using a mod, and in response to this, Yandere Dev kicked them from the game and left him an interesting message.
929480	936680	Honestly, the video is a bit pissy, but it's obviously just a fan who's annoyed, and as videos go, it's fairly Marv Manut,
936680	944680	it'd be reasonably easy to diffuse as a creator who the fan probably looks up to. Instead, Yandere Dev responds by going on an angry diatribe
944680	952760	about how this guy's a dumbass, and he can f right off. When asked to justify this on Reddit, maybe saying it was just a heat of the moment thing,
952760	960280	he stated that he was a passionate guy, he didn't really see any issue with that tone, because he's a person who puts his all into this game.
960280	966600	But it's not that simple, you can work hard on something, but that doesn't give you free license to be a colossal dick about it.
966600	973080	This is what people mean when they speak about arrogance, they mean this attitude that someone is entitled to behave in such a way,
973080	978440	because of a greater cause that they are participating, when those things are not connected at all.
978440	985960	You're not above certain principles of civility, and sometimes, as an adult, as a public figure, people will hold you to much tighter accounts.
985960	993000	This was a pattern with Yandere Dev, I could go all over these examples, but I'd just be repeating myself, he frames it as honesty,
993000	1001560	and him speaking his mind, but being honestly unpleasant is still being unpleasant, from the position he was in, it came across as arrogance as well,
1001560	1006280	and as we'll find out later, when other people were unpleasant back to him, he didn't take it well.
1006280	1012920	Nonetheless, this isn't my favourite example, because eventually, he didn't just go from responding badly to audiences who were impatient,
1012920	1021880	he went to blaming them altogether. Until recently, on the Yandere Dev wiki, it stated that Yandere Dev is best known for working really hard.
1021880	1029960	It's almost like Yandere Dev wrote it himself. Well, it's possible he did. However, as mentioned, many people have doubted that,
1029960	1040200	given the slow progress, but in 2016, he decided to finally explain what was holding him up. What was Yandere Simulator's biggest problem?
1040200	1054120	Well, you might be surprised. In this now removed video, Yandere Dev blames emails for the prevention of progress on the project. Yes, emails.
1054120	1069880	You're probably sick of hearing about it by now. I'm certainly sick of talking about it. I'd love to stop bringing up this subject, but that can only happen when it stops being the biggest problem I'm facing.
1069880	1074760	In fact, he stated that he spends 8-12 hours a day on them.
1074760	1090040	I receive an avalanche of emails every single day. Depending on how much email I get, sometimes I spend between 8 and 12 hours going through my email,
1090040	1095480	leaving me with no time left in the day to write code for the game.
1095480	1103640	Now, this is where the contradiction appears, because you must be thinking to yourself, well, these must be important emails if you spend so much time on them.
1103640	1106040	Well, they're apparently not.
1106040	1122040	When you send me a stupid email, you are actively sabotaging the game's development. If you want this game to come out faster, you should not email me unless it's absolutely necessary.
1122040	1129480	In fact, throughout the video, he brands a high majority of these emails as stupid. He goes through each category of stupid emails.
1129480	1137640	I do wonder how this video flew with anyone who isn't stupid, because there is no way that this makes any remote sense.
1137640	1145960	I strongly dislike this video, whether it's the floating screen demon, or his incredibly condescending tone, like he's talking to a bunch of 12 year olds,
1145960	1156200	though he might be, I don't know his audience. That's my feelings, but even feelings aside, this was about as watertight as the Titanic, post Iceberg of course.
1156200	1167160	The emails that I receive fall into five categories, volunteers, bug reports, questions, suggestions, and fan works.
1167160	1173640	I don't understand. Firstly, I'm surprised and somewhat skeptical that as many people as he said emailed him.
1173640	1182360	Secondly, if so few emails that you receive are worthwhile, although they can be irritating in the moment, what was stopping him from either not bothering to open them,
1182360	1188920	or just opening, seeing what it's about, and once they've been deemed stupid by his standards, closing them again.
1188920	1195960	Stupid emails should take less than ten seconds to check, and doing the maths, that means he was getting through a lot of emails in a day,
1195960	1200280	and I found it hard to buy that he was just engaging with every last one.
1200280	1212200	If someone volunteers to help me out, and they don't include any examples of their previous work, I immediately delete their email and move on to the next one.
1212520	1223320	I'm not going to waste my time typing an email that says, I don't know whether or not I want your help, I haven't even seen what your work looks like yet,
1223320	1226040	show me what your work looks like first.
1226040	1229800	Oh wait, he does that too, so he might just be held up by the volume of emails.
1229800	1239240	How many emails would he be receiving though? If he was receiving emails from so many people offering to volunteer, maybe he should have a volunteer for his emails.
1239240	1246200	The video seemed like a rather mean-spirited way for YandereDev to scapegoat his own audience as the reason for his shortcomings.
1246200	1254440	It's basic management, and blaming your audience because you can't handle it is just daft, implying that they are sabotaging the development.
1254440	1264200	It's ridiculous, making a simple request for less emails is fair enough, but telling people that sending emails is ruining the progress of the game is not just blatantly untrue,
1264200	1269800	but do you not know about the Streisand effects? Why would you bring more attention to your emails?
1269800	1277880	Pretty sure the Yandere Simulator demographic aren't the biggest users of that medium of communication, why would you remind them that it exists?
1277880	1287960	It's like Superman making a video about how people shouldn't bring Kryptonite near him, it's a waste of time, he wasted his time making a video about how emails are wasting his time.
1287960	1291800	Stop. Stop right there.
1291800	1303080	After two years of this nonsense, I've already heard every single possible suggestion about how I can solve my email problem.
1303080	1310440	There is no idea that you could possibly suggest that I haven't already shot down.
1310440	1319160	So don't send me your brilliant ideas for how to solve my email problems, because it's not going to work.
1319160	1328920	The only way you can help me solve my email problems is if you stop sending me emails.
1328920	1333400	You can see what part of time management I'm not really a fan of on his behalf.
1333400	1340200	Even if the video is not intended as a scapegoat, it's clear he cares too much about things that can be handled fairly easily.
1340200	1348200	As noted, he definitely has his limitations, however, capability to not spend whole days on going through emails should not be one of them.
1348200	1355960	Of course, he didn't recognise that, and after listing out all the ways you shouldn't email him, does actually address some of the rather unpleasant interactions that he's had.
1355960	1365240	However, he does it by making a monologue about how he's descending like some kind of anti-hero over Beethoven's number seven symphony as if the boy thinks he's slick.
1365240	1375160	You know, there was a point in time when I was a very nice and patient person.
1375160	1387800	But, working on this game for the past two years has been very stressful, and it has sucked all of the niceness out of me.
1387800	1392520	I no longer have any patience left.
1392520	1399160	I've started responding to emails using very harsh and abusive language.
1399160	1417480	I'm not proud of myself for doing this, and I'd like to stop, but it has become impossible to control my temper when I'm subjected to the same stupid garbage every hour of every day,
1417480	1424120	despite the fact that I constantly ask people to stop.
1424120	1432760	I'm only going to get grumpier and grouchier and angrier the longer this goes on.
1432760	1440120	Please stop sending me stupid emails.
1440120	1448920	We all deal with stress in different ways, and it's okay to open up about these things, but Yandere Dev has a way of doing it that just seems to push blame onto other parties,
1448920	1456360	even those who may admire him, and he's just so unnecessarily irritable that it makes it very hard for others to empathise.
1456360	1464440	This was the first time it appeared that he had made a seemingly direct video addressing these issues, and it didn't give me hope for the coming years of research.
1464440	1469880	It seemed to lack a sense of responsibility and understanding of the life he's living, and what comes with it.
1469880	1474840	But it was about to get even deeper than that, but let's talk more about his time-wasting.
1483400	1491080	I think this was somewhat deeper than just that though, and I want to talk about the nature of time-wasting and why he was doing it.
1491800	1499560	Yandere Dev had a problem known as chronic justification syndrome. It is the motivation to respond to every single criticism,
1499560	1505080	and suggestion to give the impression to your audience that you are on top of everything, you are in control.
1505080	1511800	Do I think he's exaggerating in his emails video? For sure, I highly doubt he ever spent 12 hours a day on his emails,
1511800	1517080	but it wouldn't surprise me if he did go about responding to various people who didn't require responses.
1517080	1522920	There are more reasons for this that I'll also divulge soon. As a creator, you have to understand that with an increased audience,
1522920	1528840	you will undoubtedly not be able to respond to every single person who criticizes you, because it is terrible time management.
1528840	1535480	But also, unless you actively enjoy it, it's a mentally depleting activity once you reach a certain size,
1535480	1541160	so wrapping himself up making videos, going through emails, is obviously going to hold you up.
1541160	1548280	Yandere Dev clearly feared people having an image of him that he didn't desire, and therefore wrapped himself up in so much drama,
1548280	1556360	that it was almost laughable. Another heavily referenced example is this one where he exchanges an email with someone from the wiki admin team,
1556360	1562680	I think it was Yandere Dev Wiki. Once again, I don't know the exact context of this, so I can't say if he has a point or not,
1562680	1570280	but it doesn't sound like a particularly necessary problem. It's a case of control, he likes to control the narrative regarding how people perceive him.
1570280	1576600	This is probably because in 2016, he was called out for his previous persona, who went by the name of Eva Zifon,
1576600	1581960	I think that's how you pronounce it, though I could be wrong, and how this person had behaved in communities.
1581960	1587000	Honestly, regarding this whole discussion, there's a lot that I'm not going to hold against a person.
1587000	1592840	All I'd say is he's quite strange, and I think many people felt the details were a little discomforting.
1592840	1598040	There's a whole additional drama attached to this, which has been covered in some other very in-depth videos.
1598040	1603880	He used to be active on the delightful hub of 4chan, which is where he originally pitched the idea for Yandere Dev.
1603880	1608360	However, they had a field day with this situation and a fair few others, so now he hates them,
1608360	1614680	despite the fact that he made the quote, most anti-SJW game in existence, and they rejected him.
1614680	1617160	What a sad story.
1617160	1623160	There were a few more serious claims we'll briefly touch on now, most worryingly was the claim of pedophilia,
1623160	1626440	for which his response left me feeling a degree of confusion.
1626440	1632680	There's been a lot of discussion about whether he was in favour of certain less than palatable activities,
1632680	1635400	though he does seem to have clarified them now.
1635400	1639240	He also responded to the claim that he'd received nudes from an underage person,
1639240	1645560	and I mean, it's all rather incoherent, does seem like he's just adjusting a statement to the tune of the criticism he was receiving,
1645560	1648120	but there's not really too many more details to this.
1648120	1653480	There was one account against him, and although a detailed testimony, there's no verifiable physical proof,
1653480	1655160	so do with it what you will.
1655160	1660600	On top of this, there was a payspin detailing what is allegedly him trying to groom a younger individual,
1660600	1664680	but payspin's format doesn't make it a particularly reliable source, unfortunately.
1664680	1671400	Now, it's fair to say that Yandere Dev is a strange character, and his internet history is not flattering to say the least,
1671400	1677960	but it's also because of that that it's not entirely clear if or where the truth ends and the lies begin in this case.
1677960	1684520	We've seen a few situations where strange behaviour is escalated with additional claims that turn out to not be entirely true,
1684520	1689640	which is why it's hard to speak conclusively here, however there is something conclusive it can tell us.
1689640	1696280	Simply put, with all these old posts and new claims floating around, it would likely make Yandere Dev fairly paranoid,
1696280	1701720	and explain why he may have felt the need to constantly defend himself, because he wanted to stomp out criticism,
1701720	1705160	and to quote, debunk the narrative while it was still fairly fresh.
1705160	1709560	He didn't want it becoming the predominant perspective, though, as noted by this volunteer,
1709560	1712680	it's probably worth remembering when considering working under him.
1712680	1723000	If 2014-2015 was the high, 2016 was the hangover. Yandere Dev did not seem to coherently understand both sides of popularity.
1723000	1732680	He had appeared to have faced these claims back in 2015, but it seems that people didn't really clock how this was affecting development of Yandere Simulator until early 2016.
1732680	1737560	But okay, if his behaviour was not how to deal with criticism, how should he deal with it?
1737560	1741480	It's important to remember the source of the impatience, the game itself.
1741480	1749640	The fact is that regardless of whether Yandere Dev was a good or bad person, a sensational majority of the fanbase just wanted the game,
1749640	1753720	and there will always be a small minority who will criticise you for other things.
1753720	1760760	Now when you become successful, you need to adapt to that success, that's something that Yandere Dev clearly couldn't understand,
1760760	1766680	because although he had hired volunteers, and made a commitment on his Patreon that he'd be hiring volunteers after a certain amount,
1766680	1775400	which he did hit at one point, given his lofty ambitions, he clearly didn't have a grip on balancing the outsourcing, and what he wanted to talk about himself.
1775400	1781320	One of the problems here is that Yandere Dev was, and maybe still is, rather possessive over his game.
1781320	1787160	This is probably why he lashed out at people suggesting changes sometimes, or criticising the choices that he made.
1787160	1790600	It certainly doesn't justify it, but it makes a little more sense.
1790600	1797880	However, being possessive also means wanting to retain creative control to a large extent, you want to see your game developed how you would like it,
1797880	1805960	I understand that, but if you spend so much time working on your own image, of course you're not gonna have anywhere near enough time to actually focus on the game,
1805960	1812200	and this meant that even if changes were being made, the fact that Yandere Dev was in control meant there was a lack of pace.
1812280	1815320	However, was that about to change?
1815320	1823480	You know, at the right opinion, we are forgiving. I think it's important to let people have the opportunity to grow, as long as you haven't done anything too grim.
1823480	1829480	It's not too late for a redemption arc, and following the Yandere Dev story, at one point you would've thought we might get it.
1829480	1835960	Now, email bollocks aside, the root of the problem that anyone could draw from what we've looked at so far was organisation.
1836040	1844280	It's clear that given the output, if it wasn't laziness, which, you know, I'll entertain for the benefit of the doubt's sake, he clearly wasn't handling it well,
1844280	1849240	and at the start of 2017, this seemed to be an issue that he was finally coming to terms with.
1850280	1859960	Let's talk about the speed of Yandere Simulator's development, the obstacles that are slowing down development, and potential solutions that could speed things up.
1860200	1867800	I mean, obviously it's a complex discussion on principle, we know that Yandere Dev hires volunteers, so he's not necessarily doing this alone,
1867800	1871400	and those volunteers are quite involved with the creation of the game.
1871400	1879560	90% of the things that you see and hear in Yandere Simulator would never have been possible without the help of those talented people.
1879560	1883880	However, all of these amazing assets come at a cost.
1884360	1887560	I am the game's director, producer, and manager.
1887560	1892760	I am also the lead artist, and the lead animator, modeler, composer, etc.
1893400	1902840	I don't create artwork or animations or models or music, but I am in charge of managing and directing all of the people who produce those things for Yandere Simulator.
1903400	1905880	I am also the game's only programmer.
1906520	1915000	I must perform all of the responsibilities that would normally be performed by about 10 different people if this was a real game company.
1915960	1919480	In spite of this, he is still heavily involved in managing each area.
1919480	1928120	As the director and the manager, he needs to make sure it comes together to make a cohesive vision, something that on principle I do empathise with.
1928120	1933720	This is covered extensively in parts 1 and 2 of a set of videos that cover the delays of the game,
1933720	1937720	and exactly how he plans on resolving those problems.
1937720	1939960	Wow, we were making progress.
1939960	1942360	So how did he resolve those problems?
1942360	1943720	Let's talk about it.
1954760	1959480	In a pair of videos at the start of 2017 titled What's Taking So Long?,
1959480	1963080	he responds to the rhetorical question that many of his audience have asked.
1963080	1968680	However, he doesn't throw any tantrums, he doesn't lose his cool, nor does he try and pin it on emails.
1968680	1974040	He explains the problems of his job, and how they and other factors influence how he manages his workload,
1974040	1978520	so in a final, deeper analysis of his problems, he looks at a few solutions.
1978520	1983560	In the past, I placed a strong emphasis on low-hanging fruit,
1983560	1989720	in other words, features that could be implemented within two weeks, with minimal assistance from volunteers.
1990360	1996280	So, for a long time, I was able to add significant new features to the game every two weeks,
1996280	1999720	but eventually, I ran out of low-hanging fruit to implement.
2000440	2003880	The next step was to work on the medium-hanging fruit,
2003880	2009240	which required more collaboration with volunteers, and more programming work than before.
2010040	2014840	This is when features started to take four weeks, or several months, to implement.
2015480	2021480	The fruit that I am aiming for now, Osana Najimi, is the highest fruit on the tree,
2021480	2026360	and requires me to spend extensive amounts of time speaking with volunteers,
2026360	2030200	which leaves me with almost no time to actually write code.
2030200	2033400	Now, some may question some of the statements that he makes in this video,
2033400	2037640	particularly pertaining to his workload, and those questions would be completely justified,
2037640	2039400	but whether he was being honest or not,
2039400	2042840	he at least seems to grasp that the current rate of progress is unsustainable.
2043800	2049000	Even though I devote almost every single hour of my life to Yandere Simulator,
2049720	2055960	I've made zero code-related progress on Osana over the past two weeks,
2056680	2061880	because of all the other things that take up my time and require my attention.
2062520	2067640	I have no problem managing a team of people, and I enjoy programming,
2067640	2072760	but there simply aren't enough hours in the day to manage a team of people
2072760	2075560	and make significant progress with the game's code.
2076280	2080360	I think that the most elegant solution would be to hire someone
2080360	2083960	to take my place as the game's lead programmer,
2083960	2089880	so that I can focus exclusively on being a director slash producer slash manager,
2089880	2092120	while someone else writes all the code.
2092120	2094360	I have specialties,
2094360	2099640	but I don't specialize in most of the stuff that Yandere Simulator needs the most.
2100680	2103080	I put forth my best effort,
2103080	2108360	but if a more experienced programmer had been in charge of writing Yandere Simulator's code,
2109080	2112920	they probably would have done a bunch of things way differently.
2112920	2117000	The general tone of this video outlines that he's going to begin making inquiries
2117000	2119480	regarding the outsourcing of various tasks,
2119480	2121880	so he doesn't have to manage everything himself.
2121960	2126120	He's seriously contemplating handing over control in executive areas.
2126120	2128760	That, for many developers, may be a brave move,
2128760	2130680	but it was a necessary move to him,
2130680	2133960	because by keeping the production public and the game accessible,
2133960	2135960	he had a pace that he had to maintain,
2135960	2137640	and if he felt like he couldn't stop,
2137640	2141560	it would not only sacrifice the speed of development, but the quality as well.
2141560	2144840	However, how he would hand over control is another question.
2144840	2147480	Let's discuss the possible methods that he presented.
2147480	2149720	The first one was a crowdfunding campaign.
2149720	2153800	Yandere Dev was planning to do a crowdfunding campaign at some point in the future regardless.
2153800	2156520	This plan merely involved moving the campaign forward,
2156520	2159080	and hiring a team to work on the project earlier.
2159080	2160280	Now, there are positives to this,
2160280	2164040	such as the fact that it allows him to retain control over the greater product,
2164040	2166280	even if he's assigning roles to other people.
2166280	2168600	This would allow work to be completed faster,
2168600	2172360	and maintain hype for the upcoming game while staying in line with his model.
2172360	2174760	Nonetheless, it's also possible that at this point,
2174760	2179080	people would feel insulted that he is once again asking for money on top of his Patreon,
2179080	2182600	and the amount they've been waiting already would not justify this.
2182600	2187160	The crowdfunding campaign was something he really should have been doing back in 2014.
2187160	2190600	It's also possible that he may not have been able to raise the money at all,
2190600	2193480	and that may be quite embarrassing for him as a developer.
2194040	2196280	I could forget about Osana,
2196280	2198760	launch the crowdfunding campaign immediately,
2198760	2199880	assemble a team,
2199880	2202840	begin refactoring the game's code as soon as possible,
2202840	2206600	and then release Osana after the refactoring was complete.
2207560	2210680	But I'm not sure if you guys would really want this.
2211320	2214760	The second solution was that he contracts with another company to finish the game.
2214760	2218760	The benefits of this were that he wouldn't have to ask for money from the audience,
2218760	2221880	and thus avoids them receiving the impression that he's exploiting them,
2221880	2224440	and he has the stability of a larger business supporting him
2224440	2227320	if he ever feels like he can't hold up the project himself.
2227320	2229480	It's more of a mutual support system.
2229480	2231400	Nonetheless, this came with its own problems,
2231400	2233560	particularly if this was done over contract.
2233560	2237320	Giving up certain creative controls may lead to the sacrifice of one's vision,
2237320	2240280	something that Yandere Dev was notoriously possessive over.
2240280	2243800	It also led to being bound into a contract that, under strain,
2243800	2246040	may cause the whole project to collapse.
2246040	2250840	Throughout this video, Yandere Dev clearly paints himself as very skeptical towards businesses.
2251560	2255320	I've already been approached by multiple companies
2255320	2260600	who have expressed an interest in getting involved with Yandere Simulator's development
2260600	2263000	in exchange for a cut of the game's profits.
2263880	2269960	They've proposed deals that involve me giving up 50% of the game's profits,
2269960	2274280	or losing ownership of the game's intellectual property,
2274280	2277160	or removing certain features from the game.
2277960	2281400	These terms are all very unappealing to me.
2281400	2283480	So it seems that whatever option he wants to choose,
2283480	2286280	there is a degree of reservation regarding them.
2286280	2289640	That was a lot of pressure, but at the end of it all, it was an ultimatum.
2289640	2292760	If Yandere Dev continued to try and do the project alone,
2292760	2296600	the time it would take for the video game to be released anyway would kill the hype regardless,
2296600	2299080	so he stated that he was prepared to take the plunge.
2299080	2302680	There was one more option that he presented, but I'm gonna save that for later.
2302680	2305000	Yandere Dev conducted a poll with these options,
2305000	2308440	and the fandom decisively backed him to remain on the current trajectory.
2308440	2313240	But the problem was, although preferable to many, maybe even to Yandere Dev himself,
2313240	2314600	it wasn't sustainable.
2314600	2319160	Yandere had continuously committed to wanting the game released by 2019,
2319160	2323400	and there was no scope of that happening if he continued in the current direction.
2323400	2325400	However, was this all smoke and mirrors,
2325400	2327800	or was he going to follow through on a commitment for once?
2327800	2330360	Well, not too long after, he posted a video which announced
2330360	2334120	that Yandere Simulator was about to enter a collaboration phase.
2334120	2339160	Alongside this, the criticism of the companies in the previous video had been reeled in a little.
2339160	2343400	During this part of the video, I portrayed companies as evil,
2343400	2346680	greedy entities that would steal money from me,
2346680	2351080	take full possession of Yandere Simulator, and censor the game.
2351080	2354600	It was a bad idea to portray companies like this,
2354600	2358600	because not every game developer or game publisher is like that.
2359240	2363720	The language that I used to describe companies in my previous video
2363720	2368920	probably had a strong effect on the poll where I asked people what they wanted me to do.
2369560	2373800	Let me take a moment to talk about companies in a non-biased way.
2374760	2379640	Over the past two weeks, I've spent a lot of time speaking with a company
2379640	2383320	that has experience developing games, publishing games,
2383320	2389000	and also working together with struggling developers to help them finish their games.
2389640	2393640	This company has a very good reputation among indie devs,
2393640	2397640	and their name came up numerous times when I asked other developers
2397640	2399880	to recommend a good company to work with.
2400520	2403400	When I asked people for their opinion on this company,
2403480	2406920	nobody was able to tell me a single negative thing about them.
2406920	2410920	Yandere Dev had made a decision to go towards a publisher or developer
2410920	2412920	rather than a crowdfunding project.
2412920	2413560	Who though?
2413560	2416360	Well, a publishing company named TinyBuild.
2416360	2419640	TinyBuild are an independent games company based in Washington,
2419640	2421000	the state, not the city.
2421000	2423720	Well, there are multiple cities named Washington, but you know what I mean.
2423720	2426600	They're the developers of the game, no time to explain,
2426600	2429320	however they've also published games from all over the globe,
2429320	2430840	and you've probably heard of some of them.
2430840	2433240	TinyBuild was probably one of the better options,
2433240	2435880	they have experience and credit within the industry,
2435880	2437480	however they're not too corporate,
2437480	2441000	and that might lend to some more trust between the collaborators in question.
2441000	2443320	Yandere Dev himself was very optimistic,
2443320	2446840	stating that he'd never heard about any bad experiences with the company,
2446840	2449320	and that many had recommended them to him.
2449320	2452200	His partnership with TinyBuild would assure many new developers
2452200	2454920	coming onto the game and working under his management.
2454920	2457960	He would still be the lead designer, he would still have the final say,
2457960	2460440	there was no power being taken away from him.
2460440	2462520	The only catch was that there would be no content
2462520	2464920	that may provide it with an adults-only rating,
2464920	2467880	but that was something that he had anticipated regardless.
2467880	2472520	Overall, the plan was for TinyBuild to take over many of the more business-related matters
2472520	2476360	on top of the development aspects that Yandere Dev felt like he was weaker in.
2476360	2482200	I have no experience hiring people, drafting contracts, trademarking things,
2482200	2487400	or any of the other business-related or law-related aspects of game development.
2487960	2492440	I'm good at making prototypes and implementing low-hanging fruit very quickly,
2493000	2497240	but I'm not really experienced enough to write complex character AI,
2497240	2499560	or do some of the other complicated things
2499560	2502680	that are needed to make Yandere Simulator become a reality.
2503240	2508440	So it makes perfect sense for me to partner up with a company like TinyBuild,
2508440	2511640	and let them handle all of the things that I'm bad at,
2511640	2514760	while I focus only on the things that I'm good at.
2514760	2519320	Yandere Dev also clarifies that this partnership mostly covers creative resources,
2519320	2523720	rather than monetary funding, thus although crowdfunding may still be a possibility,
2523720	2527320	he would eventually charge people to play the alpha version of the game
2527320	2530360	once he considers it complete enough to begin charging.
2530360	2533800	This is a decision that he would make after he had finished Osana.
2533800	2536600	He also said he would not be changing much monetarily,
2536600	2541000	and YouTube ad revenue alongside Patreon was still his only sources of income.
2541000	2543720	However, one of the most significant developments was that TinyBuild
2543720	2545960	would be providing Yandere Dev with a programmer
2545960	2549720	who would sort out a new code for the game, while he was working on Osana.
2549720	2551800	Progress would be slow at first, but eventually,
2551800	2554680	as according to this very professional graph,
2554680	2557800	the pace would pick up as TinyBuild take over more assets,
2557800	2560920	leaving Yandere Dev to focus on his executive role.
2560920	2565000	Wow, like a jigsaw, it was all finally falling into place.
2565000	2567720	Except it didn't, it kinda failed.
2567720	2571480	Well, yeah, but we're meant to build up the tension.
2571480	2575960	Yes, I'm sure your viewers are on the edge of their seat waiting for me to pop up, aren't they?
2575960	2580200	What we're supposed to do is talk about coding. Do you know about programming?
2580200	2583560	I'm a gamer first and foremost, and I always will be.
2584120	2587160	Huh, I don't see you as the gaming type.
2588040	2592040	Okay then, let's talk about the failure of the TinyBuild partnership, shall we?
2592040	2595240	A game development cycle is the most turbulent time of the year.
2595240	2597400	There's a saying when it comes to game development,
2597400	2600440	if all else fails, hire someone to do the job for you,
2600440	2602920	and then reap all the benefits for being a sole developer
2602920	2606120	while leaving the poor person in the dust to become a ghost in the industry.
2607240	2608600	I made that one up.
2608600	2612680	But the point is that it's extremely rare for someone to work on a massive game completely
2612680	2614920	and utterly on their own with no assistance whatsoever,
2614920	2617560	and when someone does and releases it to a wide audience,
2617560	2621800	there's a chance that it could turn out really, really good, or really, really bad.
2621800	2624920	I've talked about this in my own video, but for the uninitiated,
2624920	2628040	Yandere Simulator is a game that runs on the Unity engine.
2628040	2632440	Before you get your superpowered panties in a twist, I'm not slating the Unity engine itself,
2632440	2636840	games that are made on the Unity engine, like any other engine, all have varying degrees of quality.
2637720	2641320	You only notice the bad asset flips because the developers didn't have enough money to
2641320	2644840	remove the watermark at the beginning of the game and have to hang their heads in shame as
2644840	2649880	the dreaded grey screen shows up saying that yes, this game is indeed made on the Unity engine.
2649880	2654040	Going back to Yandere Simulator, and the most common complaint about the game was that it
2654040	2658280	runs like an athlete in co-op, but he's got a third leg protruding from his stomach and he
2658280	2662840	runs by constantly front flipping down the track, and the buttons also included the mouse keys on
2662840	2667800	the side. The game was horrible to run, even on a beast rig. Loading up into the lobby and you're
2667800	2671560	greeted with less frames than viewers on the standard mixer stream and all you could really
2671560	2676040	do to keep your PC from pricking itself was look at the floor. Of course this spells problems for
2676040	2680200	the casual player with a less than stellar PC and significant lack of YouTube money,
2680200	2683880	as opening the game would open your entire town to nuclear destruction.
2683880	2687800	There are quite a few reasons why this is an issue, especially in Yandere Simulator,
2687800	2691400	but the biggest one goes down to the way the game is being programmed by the dev.
2691400	2695640	If you looked at the game without any knowledge as to its background or how it was even created,
2695640	2699720	you'd probably think that it could easily run on a calculator, but if you played it, you'd probably
2699720	2704520	be lucky to get a frame in. But why is this? I touched upon this in my own video, but if there
2704520	2709640	was one thing Yandere Dev wasn't really the best at, it was programming his game properly to work
2709640	2714200	efficiently and on all devices. The code looked like a complete nightmare. It was like the whole
2714200	2718360	concept of variables was unheard of to him. Before you guys brandish your pitchforks and call for my
2718360	2722760	public execution for being mean about his coding when he never had any experience before, let me
2722760	2727480	explain why a lot of people take a big issue with his programming. Yandere Simulator has been in
2727480	2732360	active development for about 5-6 years, and he's been programming the game the entire time when he
2732360	2736840	wasn't livestreaming video games or making more videos explaining the law. He's being paid the
2736840	2740840	same wage, if not more than professional programmers who by now would have completely
2740840	2745000	finished the game and done several patches to it and released it on the Nintendo Switch and
2745000	2749560	Nokia brick. He's commented that he knows his code looks awful and that he only codes on areas
2749560	2753960	that aren't used frequently. If he's saying that, then that means he clearly knows how to code
2753960	2758680	properly so why isn't he doing it? The code looks like a complete mess! In the code he uses the
2758680	2762680	update function, and he fills it to the brim with things that the game will do at that specific
2762680	2767320	point. The problem is that with this function, said things would run every single frame.
2767320	2771560	I can go into more detail about the coding but several programmers have made comments and points
2771560	2775640	about it, so I'll leave notes about what the professionals say were troves so he can add it
2775640	2779880	to the really really large amount of sources that's been compiled for the video. Now where
2779880	2784600	does TinyBuild come in? TinyBuild offered to extend their services to Yandere Dev as any
2784600	2788200	professional programmer would look at the code that he's done and projectile vomit all over
2788200	2792360	the screen. Initially reluctant to have another programmer do a better job than him, he eventually
2792360	2796600	caved and a developer was sent to work on the game, with TinyBuild hopping on board to publish
2796600	2800680	the game should it get released. Good coding is meant to be flexible, quick and efficient,
2800680	2804600	so that when needed, you can make quick optimisation edits and make sure the game
2804600	2809640	doesn't murder your Intel Atom processor from 1923. This is what the TinyBuild developer ended
2809640	2814120	up getting up to, optimising hundreds of lines of code to make sure that the game runs slightly
2814120	2818360	better than it did before that point, which meant removing the depressing amounts of else-if
2818360	2822360	arguments in the code. The partnership lasted a while with the programmer allegedly redoing
2822360	2826600	most of the code of the game, until he was suddenly dropped with a statement made on Yandere Dev's
2826600	2830600	Patreon, pretty much saying that the code couldn't be read because it was too simplified and there
2830600	2835080	was a lack of else-if statements to boot, as it would hinder the progress of him making his game.
2835080	2839640	At this, TinyBuild packed their bags and left the project, probably not seeing a completion date for
2839640	2843880	the game this decade or even century. With their departure and the programmers yeeting off the
2843880	2848920	project, Yandere Dev was now free to execute an extra 2048 lines of code in a single update
2848920	2853400	function to run every single frame, and finish his plan to cause global warming all over again
2853400	2857800	and raise the overall heat of the earth with the amount of fried PCs the game would end up causing
2857800	2862040	over the next few years. But this wasn't the only thing that Yandere Dev had been accused of
2862040	2867000	neglecting, nay, he had more trouble under his belt that even more information has been shown
2867000	2873240	as recent as a week before writing this segment, and that heinous crime is… stealing assets.
2874120	2878360	Allegedly, it's been stated that he's been stealing assets for his game, and while I
2878360	2882120	wouldn't put it past him to do such a thing, I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt
2882120	2886360	in this situation. Throughout the entirety of the development cycle of the game thus far,
2886360	2889960	Yandere Dev has promised that the models and assets that are currently in the game
2889960	2894120	will be replaced down the line with more polished models from the ground up. The very model for the
2894120	2898120	main character of the game is taken straight out of the Unity Asset Store, and quite a lot
2898120	2901480	of the assets around the school were taken from various places from the internet. Now,
2901480	2905880	standard development practices list that without a license or specific written permission from the
2905880	2910680	owner of the assets as well as credit, you cannot monetize your game whatsoever. You just got caught
2910680	2915160	using that one font that you downloaded from DaFont years ago on a used Parkbench asset that
2915160	2919320	you forgot even existed? Well too bad, someone found it and now you're thousands of dollars
2919320	2923720	in debt and your games keep banned from every single marketplace ever conceivable. Now Yandere
2923720	2927960	Dev didn't want any of this to happen to his game, he was planning on making big bucks and
2928040	2933400	selling it on the biggest marketplaces known to man… and the Epic Game Store, so he promised that
2933400	2937800	the models of the game would change down the line. Now you guys must've heard from either me or Tro
2937800	2943080	earlier on that Yandere Dev makes use of volunteers to keep the game going on, he isn't a one man band,
2943080	2947560	a man needs help! And what better way to get help than with people who are sacrificing their free
2947560	2951880	time in order to provide you with some assets to improve your game? Which is exactly what one
2951880	2956840	artist did for him. On Twitter, an artist named Sozomeika recently made a thread unearthing the
2956840	2961240	turbulent tales of her encounters with the Dev. She had improved the character designs of the game
2961240	2965320	to make them 50 times more original than the original concept, providing concept art for
2965320	2970040	Yandere-chan amongst other things. She states that she was asked to modify the in-game model,
2970040	2974280	design posters, illustrate his YouTube skits, redraw another artist's work because he didn't
2974280	2979880	like the quality, design skins and contribute some props. Now you're probably thinking to yourself,
2979880	2984440	that's a whole lot of work, surely she didn't do all of it? Well she ended up doing the entire
2984440	2988520	thing and submitted it. Now before you get your pitchforks out again and blast the artist for
2988520	2992760	working for free, you guys need to understand that at the time she was still a teenager,
2992760	2997000	and worked on multiple jobs in addition to trying to build her online presence and portfolio. And
2997000	3002360	besides, it was the perfect opportunity to work with THE Yandere Dev… just as long as she got
3002360	3006760	credit. The video was released and to the shock and horror of a grand total of no one, there was
3006760	3011640	no credit in the video. She had to email Yandere Dev to get credit for the work she did, and when
3011640	3017800	she asked he told her no, citing nepotism as a reason. In this thread, Maika also shows the
3017800	3022120	emails that Yandere Dev sent her, and I'll just present these without comment. Discounting the
3022120	3026600	melodramatic nature of some of these emails, why does there need to be a back and forth about this?
3026600	3031320	Just credit the artist? Other games don't seem to have this issue so I don't understand what the
3031320	3036360	problem is here, especially if the artist didn't ask for payment or anything, just credit. The work
3036360	3040920	that was handed to her was very intense and that's enough work for a full-time freelancer gig,
3040920	3044760	so the fact that she didn't ask for money in the first place makes it even more essential
3044760	3049560	that you give her full credit for the work she did, immediately on publication. All in all,
3049560	3053720	the rampant mismanagement of the game seems to never end, and hopefully there's going to be
3053720	3059960	some improvements to the way the game is run… yeah I'm not too sure about that one, but at
3059960	3064120	least this was a fun revisit to the antics of Yandere Dev. Back to you in the studio!
3070920	3094520	That's gonna be a massive yikes from me. Yandere Dev was never particularly well trained in the
3094520	3098840	area of development, although he described himself as strong at implementing the quote
3098840	3103960	low hanging fruit. This was probably simply because it was something he was capable of doing
3103960	3108520	using a less than ideal method. In some future posts, he said that he couldn't talk about the
3108520	3113080	deterioration of his partnership with TinyBuild, although he later said something, so I'm not sure
3113080	3117480	what the terms of his legal contracts were. In summary, it appears that Yandere Dev had
3117480	3122600	compatibility issues with a more efficient system, and I think that can be a problem. He would often
3122600	3127640	go on in the future to frame it as a subjective difference, despite admitting to being poor at it
3127640	3133000	in previous videos, and I don't think it's merely creative differences, so let me explain.
3133000	3138680	Okay, so, I play squash. It's a fun game. For most squash players who want to win matches,
3138680	3143240	there are a general set of principles that your style of play should adhere to. We all have
3143240	3147480	personal touches that help us develop our own brand, but at the end of the day, if you play
3147480	3152760	in a style that is too incompatible with the game of squash, chances are you won't win the game.
3152840	3157880	This is a general principle that you can follow into most professions and hobbies. Creating a
3157880	3163320	video game stems from the same general rules. It is likely that we have our own personal flair
3163320	3168200	and approach, but there are general rules that will alter the outcome in a possibly favourable
3168200	3173480	and unfavourable way with your audience. At the end of the day, the only person I'm playing a squash
3173480	3179480	game for is me. There is no one else out there who is invested in my performance, so I'm not expected
3179480	3184920	to perform. However, if I was contracted, or if I was playing for a league team, I think it'd be
3184920	3189960	reasonable for me to adhere to a few rules to make sure that my performance in the task was somewhat
3189960	3195000	efficient. Now, Yandere Dev could develop a game how he wanted to on principle, however, he also
3195000	3200760	had a lot of people who had an implanted expectation based on industry standards, and given that he was
3200760	3204920	often appealing to that audience for the funding and support, you'd think he would have been more
3204920	3209800	focused on delivering. When his initiative received a groundswell of support in 2014,
3209800	3213720	what he should have done is worked out how to improve his skill at programming before then
3213720	3217640	working out how to develop the game in a constructive way rather than basing his
3217640	3222360	developments off what would build the most hype and just doing it his own way, which only postponed
3222360	3227320	the eventual confrontation of the unfinished game. When a solution had finally been calculated,
3227320	3231880	almost three years after the development began, his previous approach to creating a game made
3231880	3236360	working with what he had incredibly difficult, and his prevailing stubbornness when presented
3236360	3240680	with a possible solution eventually prevented the progress that may have been achieved.
3240680	3244920	It reminds me of an old post he made where he turned some hard coding feedback he received
3244920	3250520	from his idol into a Batman's origin story. I turned the hatred into a burning passion.
3250520	3255240	It's a dark post, and he did actually admit he was wrong in 2015, so I'm not going to
3255240	3260360	hold it against him, but I don't think he thought about the feedback enough because we ended up in
3260360	3264680	this mess regardless. It's hard to fully empathise with him, because to me it seems
3264680	3269720	he must have apprehended these problems in advance and pushed on regardless. Instead,
3269720	3274520	by going for the quote low hanging fruit, it meant that the problems with his style didn't become
3274520	3279480	apparent until after a significant amount of development had taken place, because he was so
3279480	3284120	focused on that, and it pushed to a point where it was much harder to reverse, to the point where
3284120	3289000	Tiny Build couldn't continue. Yandere Dev himself was too stubborn to learn how to adapt, and the
3289000	3295000	progress of the game suffered for it. However, living in this world of denial, come 2018,
3295000	3300360	he decided that actually all these factors that are basically self-evidential at this point were
3300360	3306440	not to blame, and he had his own theory. In another condescending video, I don't know how
3306440	3311800	he does it with that tone, called How Long Does It Take To Make A Video Game?, he presents his own
3311800	3317560	version of events. How long does it take to make a video game?
3318600	3325720	The answer is, it depends on a large number of different factors, such as the genre, the budget,
3325720	3331880	the size of the team, the complexity of the game, whether it's an original game or an imitation,
3331880	3335880	and a bunch of other factors that you probably wouldn't have considered.
3336760	3342840	It's not an exact science, you can't really create a formula that tells you exactly how
3342840	3348680	long a game should be in development for, because each game has a different set of circumstances.
3348680	3352760	Let's break down the main points of the video, then. The first one is that the length that a
3352760	3357000	video game takes to be developed typically corresponds to the quality. He once again
3357000	3362280	used a very compelling graph to demonstrate this, and although obviously it's quite easy to pick out
3362280	3366520	the low sample number he uses, and the fact that obviously it would not be difficult to cherry
3366520	3371800	pick this at all, as a point, it's much easier to focus on the implication that somehow this,
3371800	3378200	as a universal rule, can be applied to his game, even though he specifically opened with the
3378200	3382920	statement that there were no specific formulas for the completion of a game.
3382920	3388520	So we've established that the more complex a game is, the longer it's going to take to develop it.
3389240	3394840	Small teams usually stick to simple games. When a small team tries to make a large,
3394840	3399240	ambitious game, the development can really stretch out for a long time.
3400440	3403240	Do you see where I'm going with this?
3403800	3407160	After asserting that games that are longer in the making are
3407160	3410680	typically higher in their complexity, particularly when they are comprised of
3410680	3414600	smaller development teams, he goes on to say that the complexity of his game,
3414600	3420920	Yandere Simulator, is comparable to a Hitman game combined with a Persona game.
3420920	3426520	He then goes on to expand on all the complexities of this game, and I'm not particularly sold.
3426520	3429800	First, as the complexity of a project increases,
3429800	3432920	it will become proportionally difficult to work on it.
3433640	3438600	Every time you add a new feature, it will affect other features, create new bugs,
3438600	3442680	increase the amount of time you need to spend waiting for the code to compile,
3442680	3448840	increase the loading times of the game, etc. Something that was simple and easy to work on
3448840	3453800	at the beginning can eventually become a nightmare that you are constantly wrestling with,
3454360	3459640	where making even the smallest amount of progress becomes very time consuming and difficult.
3459640	3464680	It's hard to deny that Yandere Simulator is an ambitious game in many ways, however,
3464680	3470040	I certainly wouldn't say it's almost as complex as two renowned games combined,
3470040	3473320	particularly when a lot of the actual results are not there.
3473320	3478600	In 2017, Yandere said that the simplicity or complexity of the game would be based on the
3478600	3483080	amount of support it received, implying that he was willing to compromise on certain elements.
3483800	3487640	The scope of Yandere Simulator will be determined by the size of its budget.
3488200	3493320	The more money we raise, the more time, work, and features we can put into the game.
3493320	3496840	But in this video, he clearly implies that it will be complex regardless of the outcome,
3496920	3500280	and uses it as a shield for the length it has taken to develop the game.
3500280	3504600	Once again, it's a sacrifice of realistic goals for personal sentiments,
3504600	3508520	and the condescending explanation of why everyone should deal with it.
3508520	3512680	On top of the programming argument that Thaf9 has likely debunked in his part,
3512680	3517000	Yandere Dev eventually talks about mental health, a very serious matter.
3517000	3522200	Yandere Dev- If you push yourself to work as many hours as humanly possible every single day,
3522200	3524920	then eventually you're going to burn yourself out.
3524920	3528200	You'll become too exhausted and fatigued to be productive.
3529080	3533560	If you work on the same project for multiple years, you'll eventually get tired of it.
3534120	3537320	This will lead to a loss of enthusiasm and motivation,
3537320	3541480	which will cause you to become more easily distracted and less productive.
3542600	3548040	If a group of weird people on the internet decide that they feel completely justified
3548040	3553160	in treating you like garbage, and you're subjected to abusive treatment on a daily basis
3553160	3558120	for multiple years, you'll become depressed, which will affect your productivity,
3558120	3561240	which will cause people to call you lazy or a scam artist,
3561800	3564840	which will cause you to receive even more abuse,
3564840	3569160	which will cause you to become even more depressed and less productive,
3569160	3572600	which becomes a never-ending cycle of abuse and depression.
3573400	3577960	Your fanbase won't know about this for a long time, because you'll do your best,
3577960	3578920	to never speak of it.
3580120	3585320	Eventually, your comment sections will be dominated by people who want to hurl insults at you,
3585320	3589240	and spew ridiculous misinformation that isn't anywhere close to being true.
3590120	3594120	Maybe a handful of people will behave with dignity and respect,
3594680	3598600	but an overwhelming number of people will be cruel and abusive.
3598600	3602520	I have to break this down because mental health in many ways is a subject close to my heart,
3602520	3605080	but at the same time, there are a lot of layers to this.
3605080	3607080	Firstly, let's talk about motivation.
3607080	3611320	We have good days and bad days, I empathise there, but you also have to understand that
3611320	3614520	if people feel that you are not keeping up with these things, particularly if they're
3614520	3619160	supporting you monetarily, they're gonna become impatient, and the problem with Yandere Dev
3619160	3623960	is that he never explained himself in a way that was empathetic to people's concerns.
3623960	3629720	That was his failing all the way back in 2016, and he hadn't amended people's concerns by this
3629720	3633560	point either. How about the unjustified harassment that he had been receiving,
3633560	3635400	and how that demotivates him?
3635400	3639880	Now, I would agree to an extent that honestly, there are people out there who are too obsessed
3639880	3644360	with Yandere Dev, and he is quite the target. Nonetheless, as said, to imply it's those
3644360	3649400	experiences that make you demotivated while not being able to take a step back from the internet
3649400	3653720	and seeing the bigger picture is a weakness that has to be partly accountable to you.
3653720	3658280	Asking where these obsessive individuals came from as if you think they just randomly threw
3658280	3665160	a dart and landed on you is dishonest. I feel that a lot of these sentiments built from 2016-2015
3665160	3670440	where they were jumped on by bad actors after a point is another discussion. He acknowledges
3670440	3675240	that this is a small minority who are going after him, and he says that a lot of the people he has
3675240	3680120	interactions with are positive, but never redefines those people from the harsher critics.
3680120	3684840	I'd say it's probable that there were some people looking to stir stuff up, but it's only because
3684840	3689800	sharks smell blood, and when some of Yandere Dev's behaviour and responses started coming to light,
3689800	3694920	they saw a guy who they could bait into lashing out and decimating his own image even further,
3694920	3700040	and Yandere Dev just could never understand that. That's the other issue I take with this,
3700040	3704920	his framing. He acts like he's avoided the drama and negative comments, and acts like it's all flared
3704920	3709240	up out of nowhere. He says he hasn't talked about it, but that's just a lie. There have been times
3709240	3713640	when he's been too far involved, and the only reason more fans probably didn't know is because
3713640	3719240	he does suppress a fair bit of it, and this led me to a new point, but I think social media harmed
3719240	3724200	Yandere Dev and the simulator more than anything. Let's talk about it.
3726520	3730760	YouTube is not the most fun environment a lot of the time. The feedback from people can be pretty
3730760	3735640	negative, pretty depressing, and I completely empathise with how that might affect productivity,
3735640	3740120	but as a game developer, if you're prone to responding badly to negative criticism,
3740120	3745320	maybe a YouTube channel and multiple social media accounts wasn't the best idea. That doesn't
3745320	3751000	justify any harassment, and I want to make that 100% clear, but from a personal perspective,
3751000	3756120	it's clear that Yandere Dev cannot help himself but try and respond, whether that criticism was
3756120	3761000	valid or not, and when he can't respond to it, he'll just try and censor it. The video that we
3761000	3766600	just covered, in spite of its rather significant view count, only has approximately 740 comments,
3766600	3771080	with a distinct lack of critical comments, even polite ones, and you're gonna have a hard job
3771080	3776040	convincing me that no one posted anything remotely nuanced. At one point, it had 72
3776040	3782200	comments off over 800,000 views. Another place where censorship has been documented was the
3782200	3787720	Reddit for Yandere Simulator, where many had also been critical of it. At the end of 2018,
3787720	3792200	it was alleged that he had bought it, although the exact words in the Discord posts were
3792200	3797640	in exchange for compensation. In the past, Yandere Dev had attempted to quash the claims against him
3797640	3802600	by making a post on the subreddit, admitting he had attempted to buy it, but clearly this was not
3802600	3807080	enough, with many people rebutting him at that point, alongside one now censored comment
3807080	3811400	comprehensively responding and sharing some evidence of their own which shows Yandere Dev in
3811400	3816040	a less than positive light, while proudly stating that they were pleased that the subreddit wasn't
3816040	3822600	bought. However, this did not last. In the end, he purchased it. What was the price? $3,000 for a
3822600	3827880	subreddit. Let that sink in. He had attempted to make his own subreddit too, but it seems that this
3827880	3832920	was not enough due to the volume of people on the other one. Yandere Dev had made it no secret that
3832920	3836920	he was not particularly fond of the Reddit community, in fact, he often doesn't seem
3836920	3841720	particularly fond of many communities, but his post announcing his acquisition was quite dark,
3841720	3846840	telling the story of a person who had manipulated administrations of the subreddit into believing
3846840	3852200	that Yandere Dev was an evil person, and then the harassment just spread like a disease,
3852200	3857480	and it all became too much for him as a person. He writes what other game developers had to deal
3857480	3864200	with this, it's become anxiety inducing to even look at the subreddits. Can you name any other game
3864200	3870440	developer who has had to deal with this nonsense? All these other subreddits are just so lovely,
3870440	3876520	and they don't have any issues. Why does Yandere Dev just receive this unprovoked backlash?
3877480	3882680	Looking at the archives, it's clear there was a lot of drama on his subreddit, and if you want to keep
3882680	3887240	your subreddit away from drama, I'd understand. In August I found posts about how they were going to
3887240	3893320	decrease discussion of Yandere Dev and create a new dedicated Reddit for him. Sounds peachy.
3893320	3898440	However, it seems that a large majority of what Yandere Dev was alleging happened earlier on in the
3898440	3904360	year, and the most popular critical posts, although quite scathing, weren't really harassing, although
3904440	3909480	it's hard to tell exactly, as a large majority of them have been deleted. However, I did manage to
3909480	3914440	dig up some of the censored posts, mostly following his How Long video, and a lot of them are pretty
3914440	3919080	concise, and some are just plain responses. Nonetheless, one trend I did notice was the
3919080	3924040	promotion of a Patreon boycott following that video, and in that month, it seems that Yandere
3924040	3929480	Dev lost over $1,000 in Patreon money, which probably bothered him a lot. There was also a
3929480	3934440	Karma Court case, which is like this court in Reddit. I don't think they have any legal
3934440	3939560	jurisdiction, but it's a thing, and I'm not going to pretend to understand it. You guys do you.
3939560	3944360	To summarise, there was some BS happening, to what extent I'm not sure. His comments weren't the
3944360	3948600	most encouraging. He wasn't really interested in whether the criticism was well-structural,
3948600	3953480	whether it was harassing, regardless of how he frames it. Yes, at the end of the post, he states
3953480	3958840	that any public criticism of him can only be done in bad faith as it means you're trying to stir
3958840	3964520	up drama, and if you have any other criticism of him, you should email him. Now, if you want your
3964520	3970280	subreddit to not be about criticism against you, you're the boss. It's a subreddit, not a democracy,
3970280	3974920	and that's what I always say about these things, but with the context of the criticism that he'd
3974920	3979880	been receiving, to many people this justification once again did not seem concerned about harassment,
3979880	3985160	but more about a desire to control the narrative, rather than focusing on the damn game. I have a
3985160	3990120	hunch that Yandere Dev felt that a lot of the criticism were mostly people pretending to care,
3990120	3994200	and that it was a slippery slope to some of the harassment that he claimed to have been receiving,
3994200	3998760	but for many, that theory just wouldn't cut it. The reason why public criticism exists,
3998760	4004200	even on a personal level, is because Yandere Dev is a person asking for money and support on the
4004200	4009240	basis of trust in his character that he will deliver a game, and if people feel that game
4009240	4013480	isn't going to be delivered, and that people's money would be better invested elsewhere, then
4013480	4018920	they 100% have a right to say that publicly, because that is in the interest of every single
4018920	4024040	person who has invested time or money into your project. Now, once again, although presenting
4024040	4029240	himself as a very busy person, Yandere Dev managed to find time to moderate this subreddit,
4029240	4034360	many of the critical posts disappeared, and in spite of Yandere Dev's claims, he was very involved
4034360	4038840	in the control of what appeared on his reddit, because managing a subreddit is definitely what
4038840	4044040	a person under time constraints to create a video game should be doing. Yandere Dev was very
4044040	4049960	blessed to receive the feedback on his game back in 2014, and I can understand that when faced with
4049960	4054760	this support, he decided to try and use social media to maintain momentum, however, he should
4054760	4059320	have restricted his interactions maximum to YouTube uploads for what he was trying to do.
4059320	4063960	Maybe if he was a bit better at responding to criticism consistently, then he would have been
4063960	4068200	able to engage on other mediums, but there's a reason a large majority of game developers
4068200	4074280	even indie game developers do not rely on public sentiment as buoyancy for a game alone. However,
4074280	4079000	I have a feeling that Yandere Dev was aware, because as we saw a tiny build, he would have
4079000	4084600	trouble without that public support. The fact is that in spite of Yandere's narrative of personal
4084600	4090440	persecution, a majority of YouTube's audiences are a lot less pedantic than industry experts,
4090440	4095160	funnily enough, and that fact was why a lot of the criticism didn't appear until much later
4095160	4099960	when people started looking at it with a more critical eye. If he'd have taken his concept to
4099960	4104520	a larger developer or industry player early on, then he probably would have received some sharp
4104520	4109000	technical criticism that could have averted these issues later on, if he had listened to them, of
4109000	4113800	course, and in all fairness, in spite of the volume of criticism that he has been subjected to, his
4113800	4118920	videos are still relatively popular, people are still engaging with his content, and the one thing
4118920	4124680	that he hasn't censored, the like to dislike bar, is regularly heavily in his favour. It seems like
4124680	4128680	his tactics had worked in a way, although I feel this would have been less of a big deal if he
4128680	4133160	just hadn't engaged it at all, he was certainly able to prevent the narrative spreading to the
4133160	4138040	core of his support base. I make that statement with a level of reservation, because his Patreon,
4138040	4142600	which is probably a barometer of those closest to the game, shows a bit of lost faith, with its
4142600	4147240	current amount being less than 50% than its peak. It seems that there are a lot more viewers who
4147240	4151960	perhaps find more entertainment value in just watching the videos, rather than directly
4151960	4156920	monetarily supporting development of the game. Although Patreon isn't his only method of income,
4156920	4161400	and he does stream and collect YouTube ad rev, which would be a very impressive amount if all
4161400	4164680	his videos are monetised, although they probably aren't.
4164680	4169800	Yandere Dev So we can attack this lady. Oh my god! Jesus f***ing Christ!
4169800	4174600	In many ways, Yandere Dev managed to shelter a lot of people from the criticism that he had received,
4174600	4179640	and if not, he managed to hold them to one side of the narrative. However, the roots of the problem
4179640	4183800	seemed clear to me, in light of the shortcomings of the development of Yandere Simulator,
4183800	4188840	people began to become restless, and that restlessness has manifested into certain behaviours,
4188840	4194600	some of which are rational, and some of which are irrational, but Yandere Dev's response was often
4194600	4197000	less than rational. Let's begin to wrap this up.
4201800	4206520	This video has gone into a lot of detail about the failings of Yandere Dev. Now I've laid it out,
4206520	4211560	I hope it's clear to see why certain decisions led him to this ultimatum. It's a classic snowball
4211560	4217400	situation, one where neither the creator nor his critics, and sometimes more obsessive followers,
4217400	4222280	were prepared to yield, so it escalated, and when these situations transpire, one of the
4222280	4228120	inevitabilities is that commentators are going to pick up on it. Now going back to the start of 2018,
4228120	4232360	this was definitely part of the attention that really bothered Yandere Dev. The video that was
4232360	4237240	the harshest was the rise and fall of Yandere Dev, a two hour saga that spent a decent amount
4237240	4242440	of time going through a lot of his worst old posts in crippling detail. It probably did upset Yandere
4242440	4247160	Dev given how he hoped it was behind him, and he probably felt he had responded, and he had
4247160	4252760	to a degree. He wrote a lot of posts on his Tumblr attempting to quote clear up misunderstandings,
4252760	4256920	I think some of his posts do clear up certain issues, but there are also two problems with
4256920	4262280	these responses. Firstly, the structure, it would often involve him quoting without any context,
4262280	4266600	this could allow him to create straw man arguments at will, and obviously reading it,
4266600	4271160	many would argue that he did. The responses were quite general, and thus never gave a sense of
4271160	4276040	closure to a lot of specific situations that occurred. Secondly, the responses weren't easy
4276040	4280680	to find, they were honest Tumblr, but they were spread out, and hard to follow, if you wanted
4280680	4285160	something specific, good luck. By doing this, it gave me the impression that he was typically just
4285160	4289000	appealing to the fans that he already had, who would hear what other people are saying through
4289000	4293720	Yandere Dev as well, rather than going directly to those sources, and on top of other comments
4293720	4298120	such as the ones made on his Reddit post, I think he often viewed public critics as beyond
4298120	4302840	conversion. Fair enough, but pushing away your critics requires your audience to have some faith
4302840	4307720	in you, and as said, although he has an audience, financial support has taken a hit through
4307720	4312680	organised boycotts, and other creators spreading publicity. His responses often hit the weak point
4312680	4317320	of being too vague to provide himself reasonable defence, but existent enough to draw more attention
4317320	4322600	to them. Other commentators jumping on this didn't help his plight, often looking with a critical eye
4322600	4327800	towards his rash nature. I've also tried not to harp on the content of these old posts too much,
4327800	4332200	but it doesn't help that many of them are pretty unnerving, even though, as I acknowledged they
4332200	4336520	were done a long time ago, at that point his sporadic and even dismissive responses would
4336520	4341560	obviously sour many people. Now, I wanted to spend this final, or nearly final part, please,
4341560	4348040	god let me finish, talking about this, because towards the end of 2018, Yandere Dev continued
4348040	4353320	to reflect on the criticism and hate that he had been receiving, and decided to make an over 20
4353320	4358680	minute video addressing it called Hate and Shame, not the most valuable usage of one's time, but
4358680	4361480	I digress, the video is an interesting one.
4361480	4368840	Yandere Dev Imagine that someone decides to take all of these embarrassing moments from your past, put them into a list,
4368920	4375000	and show that list to his friends. Then, he claims that this list represents you.
4375720	4381720	His friends believe him, and develop a twisted mental image of you. They perceive you as a
4381720	4388120	caricature of who you really are, with all of your flaws greatly exaggerated. Unfortunately for you,
4388120	4394440	their hobby is ridiculing and shaming people, and they've decided that you would be a fun target.
4395320	4400760	And so, they start stalking you. They follow you everywhere you go, taking pictures of you,
4400760	4405720	recording videos of you, and digging through your trash to look for anything embarrassing
4405720	4410600	you might have thrown away. Sometimes they even try to directly provoke you,
4410600	4415000	because they think it's funny if they get a reaction out of you. If you're an artist,
4415000	4419160	they'll claim that you're bad at painting. If you're a chef, they'll claim that you're bad at
4419160	4423080	cooking. And if you're a programmer, they'll claim that you're bad at writing code.
4423080	4427480	I assume this is meant to be an analogy, although it's hard to tell. The hate and shame video is
4427480	4432360	basically 22 minutes of Yandere Dev talking from this disconnected perspective about his own
4432360	4437720	personal experience. His purpose is to try and make people empathise with him, and maybe give
4437720	4442680	him some advice. I was gonna say that his video shows a failure to distinguish between the online
4442680	4446680	and real world, but then he goes to talk about the real world harassment that he alleges to
4446680	4452040	have received. After enough people have been convinced that you're an awful, terrible person
4452040	4458120	who deserves to be ridiculed and scorned, you will begin to receive harassment, prank calls,
4458120	4463000	weird things being mailed to your house, getting spammed with pictures of animal abuse and
4463000	4470360	bestiality, being stalked in real life. The video made me feel two things, sad and manipulated.
4470360	4475400	It's a depressing video, and this could be how Yandere Dev interprets the situation,
4475400	4480520	he has this status that would obviously not make elements of the internet enjoyable,
4480520	4485560	and there is a lot of personal stuff out there, but I also find it very manipulative, the use of
4485560	4491000	generalisations, vagueness, and purely anecdotal content, it personally rubs me the wrong way,
4491000	4495800	and I get that the internet can be a pretty toxic place, it sucks that there are always people out
4495800	4499480	there a little to obsess with you, and with something like Yandere Simulator and the sort
4499480	4504520	of cult-like status it acquired, it's very easy for one of those avid fans to become sour and then
4504520	4508680	be on an all-out crusade to get you, probably bolstered by some real sicker fans on the more
4508680	4512440	menacing side of the internet, and that will probably spill into your real life,
4512440	4518440	so I'm not saying for certain that this didn't happen, but my god, you don't feed the trolls,
4518440	4524200	Yandere Dev was practically providing them with an all-you-can-eat buffet. In a later post,
4524200	4529880	he stated that his video on emails actually led to an increase in emails, so I don't know why
4529880	4535400	he thought a video on this topic would lead to any sort of de-escalation. These videos also had a
4535400	4540120	tendency to spray fire at their targets, although in a later post Yandere Dev would claim that his
4540120	4544680	video is mostly directed towards these trolls and harassers, in the video he draws a clear link
4544680	4549560	between the people who have criticised him as those who are also responsible for the harassment,
4549560	4554520	implying that they are the people who then go out and do that harassment, although as mentioned,
4554520	4559000	it's likely these were quite different parties due to the altering motivations and goals that
4559000	4563800	would come with it. On top of this, parts of his video seem to encompass points even more general,
4563800	4569080	attacking YouTubers who have spoken about him using video titles to reference creators like
4569080	4573400	KappaKaiju and Thaf9 while calling out their approach to making their videos.
4573960	4580120	Channels that are dedicated to ridiculing and shaming other people. These YouTubers make money
4580120	4586360	by degrading, debasing and defaming others. Eventually, these YouTubers will hear what
4586360	4590760	the gremlins are saying about you, and then they will start making videos about you.
4591560	4597880	It doesn't benefit them to portray you with accuracy and honesty, it benefits them to
4597880	4603720	exaggerate your flaws and depict you as a cartoonish caricature of who you really are,
4604440	4610760	because that would be more entertaining and will result in more clicks and views, maximizing their
4610760	4616840	ad revenue. If they really were interested in telling the truth, then they would contact you
4616840	4623080	directly and ask you for your side of the story. However, none of them will ever do this.
4623080	4627320	I think ultimately the problem with this video and the problem with all of this drama is that
4627320	4633240	he skips a key part of responding to drama, and it's ultimately why he ended up in this mess,
4633240	4640200	and that is evidence. I know people like KappaKaiju and Thaf9, they may not be gods or gurus,
4640200	4644760	they may not be the all-seeing eye, I'm not either, but they don't go out with the intention
4644760	4650440	of crucifying people, they go with what they're given, and at that point they had very little
4650440	4655160	from Yandere Dev. You can't just say, oh, if they really want something, they should email me.
4655160	4659480	If you're not prepared to put something out there publicly, why should they trust you in private
4659480	4664280	with it? I've trusted people in private before, and it has cost me. If you don't have anything
4664280	4670920	publicly revolutionary to say to the drama, don't say anything at all. Yandere Dev always wanted to
4670920	4677640	talk about it, but never had anything to actually say, and fortunately, his audience recognised that,
4677640	4683240	because at the end of his hate and shame video, he conducted a poll, asking whether he should make
4683240	4689000	more videos regarding this issue, oh god, or whether he should leave it behind and focus on
4689000	4694920	the game. People voted pretty conclusively for the latter, the game. I think that's something of
4694920	4700200	importance to note regarding this video, it is once more an appeal to his already existent audience
4700200	4705160	on what he should do about this drama. If you don't like Yandere Dev, you're not gonna like this
4705160	4711960	video, and boy, a fair few people did not. There were a load more criticisms about him deleting
4711960	4717960	comments, including this video which shows them being removed in live time. Once again, even mild
4717960	4721800	ones, there was a person who claimed to be the original artist for the video who had their own
4721800	4728840	comments to make about the Dev's behaviour. Ironically, yet unsurprisingly, this video about drama
4728840	4733560	caused more drama. I'm not going to rule out the idea that Yandere Dev may have experienced some
4733560	4738280	legitimate harassment at the hands of trolls, and he has regularly cited this as the reason for why
4738280	4743000	he has behaved in a rather erratic and even toxic way himself. Nonetheless, I feel that this can
4743000	4748120	only be used as a defence up to a point, because his short-tempered demeanour was existent prior
4748120	4753640	to the escalation of the drama that he argued to be engaged in, and his behaviour has extended
4753640	4759160	beyond the erratic and emotional into the calculated. It just reaches a point where you
4759160	4765000	line all the drama up, and it becomes hard to say that these incidents are as isolated as he claims
4765000	4770200	them to be. I don't doubt that Yandere Dev probably had many positive interactions with his audience,
4770200	4775160	and I'm not going to argue against that point, but even in context with Yandere Dev's greater
4775160	4779960	character, the negative interactions held a significant frequency and relevance to the
4779960	4785320	discussion at hand. A lot of the video was once again focusing on what he was experiencing,
4785320	4789960	rather than a natural response to the points against him, and maybe we would have received
4789960	4794680	a more concise response if people had voted for it, but I don't know how he would respond
4794680	4798520	to the various criticisms that escalated throughout the year, such as the volunteers
4798520	4802600	who claimed he wasn't treating them well enough, the discord users who claimed he just spontaneously
4802600	4807240	banned them for no discernible reason, the people he flipped out at over email, or whatever other
4807240	4811800	communicative mediums. Since then, he has reiterated the idea that the harassment was
4811800	4816520	what caused him to behave in such a way. If he believes the harassment placed him in a negative
4816520	4820840	state of mind that predisposed him to behave in such a way, then what else would he have
4820840	4825480	had to say in additional videos? I think for the benefit of him, his audience, and for anyone
4825480	4832120	involved, it was best left there. So what has happened since then? Well, the only real point
4832120	4837000	of interest in this is what is known as the debunk page, which provides running updates
4837000	4841880	to criticism that he's been receiving. It's certainly more nuanced than his previous responses,
4841880	4846040	and one thing I did appreciate was that he seems to recognise those who are frustrated with the
4846040	4851560	game's development in a nuanced way, though I'm not sure how he treats that attitude publicly,
4851560	4856120	and I do feel that such an approach is prone to miscategorisation, and I'd stress that it's always
4856120	4861240	best to side on the benefit of the doubt when dealing with certain criticisms. As you, the viewer,
4861240	4865560	you're more than at liberty to check out these responses, as they're probably the most composed
4865560	4869960	Yandere dev has been, although I would stress that many have taken issue with them still,
4869960	4875000	and made videos of their own. I find the response page rather defensive, and although definitely
4875000	4879960	a bit more refreshing, it's not a significant deviation from his old narratives that I would
4879960	4885800	still personally take issue with. The point is, when dealing with drama, if you don't have anything
4885800	4889720	that's going to turn perspectives on its head, particularly when your content is being well
4889720	4895320	received otherwise, it's not sensible to make videos obsessing over the situation. In a discord
4895320	4901000	post he said that everything after this was going to worsen, first a 20% dislike bar, then a 30%
4901000	4909240	dislike bar, then 50%, 100%, 1000%, everything was going to fall apart and the game would be cancelled
4909240	4920760	and no one would support him anymore. But wait, it didn't. Why not? Let's end this.
4939480	4944680	Yandere Dev acted like he was on the verge of losing everything, yet even at its lowest,
4944680	4950200	his videos were backed up by a strong, dedicated audience. There are only two ways that losing
4950200	4955800	momentum of his size could happen. Firstly, if someone makes a well written, devastating,
4955800	4961480	exposed video or post and completely turn public perception on its head, or if people in general
4961480	4966920	become disillusioned or bored as a whole and stop supporting. The first one didn't really happen,
4967000	4971720	the only well organised videos were fairly mild mannered, and others were just not well produced
4971720	4976600	enough. So maybe it's the second, but that didn't really happen either, there were disillusioned
4976600	4982200	people, but not that many of them, and even fewer who were actually taking part in any of the stuff
4982200	4986760	that he accused people of. People who want to spread criticism of your game or hurt your image,
4986760	4991000	probably aren't going to be the same as people who want to harass you because that would compromise
4991000	4995960	their own point. Providing that happened, that was likely mostly trolls who latched onto the
4995960	5000840	disillusion as an excuse to cause havoc. A lot of attention on the drama was generated
5000840	5006600	by Yandere Dev himself, and although the minority was quite vocal at points, its reach was limited
5006600	5012440	to certain domains, only being boosted when Yandere Dev would respond himself. Let's be clear,
5012440	5018360	the people who said shut up and focus on the game were doing Yandere Dev a massive service,
5018360	5019800	and he should have listened sooner.
5027640	5032520	For a bit, it did tail off, but it flared up again at the start of 2020, with what seemed to be more
5032520	5037720	completely unnecessary drama. Yandere Dev placed his Discord server in a position where you pay to
5037720	5042040	message due to an alleged number of raids, and although it's his server, once again, it seems
5042040	5046360	like a bad thing to be managing himself. Someone tweeted out an interaction where they messaged
5046360	5050520	him suggesting technical changes that could prevent raids, while also maintaining activity,
5050520	5054520	which of course there are multiple. You turn off link embeds, turn off images, slow mode, strong
5054520	5059000	moderation team, IP banning, blacklisted words, and I hate this discussion, because eventually
5059000	5064200	when this guy clearly presents a load of solutions and rebuts Yandere Dev's comments, Yandere Dev
5064200	5069800	just turns around and says, actually, you don't get it. No, my friend, you don't get it, and I wonder
5069800	5073800	if you'll ever get it, if there are technical solutions to a problem you can't appeal to some
5073880	5078680	greater level of understanding which doesn't exist. Some people might get past one or two
5078680	5082920	blocks, but Discord has a load of settings and bots that can be used to prevent such activity
5082920	5088360	without using a paywall, which is what it is, no semantics. He did open up again, thankfully,
5088360	5093160	but Jesus Christ, this drama has turned the Discord into a bit of a punchline, with people
5093160	5098440	speedrunning it. People see this stuff as funny, Yandere Dev doesn't, takes it very seriously,
5098440	5103880	and then people meme it more. It's a cycle. In a now deleted tweet made in January 2020,
5103880	5108360	Yandere Dev also loses to taking his own life due to this harassment, and without sounding like Tyler
5108360	5113320	the Creator, and with all respect, the fact that online work can be extremely stressful, he needs
5113320	5117960	to take a step back from the internet and stop engaging in it to the degree he does. Add this to
5117960	5121880	the claim that he's making less than minimum wage right now, which, although I personally find to be
5121880	5126360	doubtful given his revenue stream, if true, I have to wonder what his motivations even are for
5126360	5131400	continuing at this stage. There are so many posts of him involving himself with drama, DMing people,
5131400	5136360	long messages, interviews, some petty arguments. I don't know if he thinks he needs to have this
5136360	5141560	interaction to maintain interest in the game, maybe he's won people over in the DMs, he probably has,
5141560	5146840	but so many times it just gets published and shows him as someone with an inability to communicate
5146840	5152520	with basic criticism in spite of him proclaiming his proficiency. It's like Yandere Dev has this
5152520	5157400	almost parasitic relationship with the internet, he sees it as the only way of maintaining the
5157400	5161800	development of his game, and yet he has so much drama and conflict, he thinks he's attaching
5161800	5166680	himself out of necessity rather than desire, and this leads to completely destructive behaviour
5166680	5171400	which he feels he has to suffer through, but by proxy of that makes him a victim. On the other
5171400	5176600	hand, Yandere Dev's critics view this victimhood as being exploited at every opportunity in an
5176600	5181800	attempt to blanket harassment with legitimate criticism and Yandere Dev's continuous failure
5181800	5186360	to deliver a finished product which for many should have been delivered a long time ago. If
5186360	5191080	you're a fan, then you may well sympathise with him, but few would disagree that a lot of this
5191080	5197160	has been avoidable, and people have still been contacting me about it. I wonder if it's because
5197160	5202440	people want my verdict on the actual progress of the game. It's hard to say, Yandere Dev now posts
5202440	5207480	update reports, but they don't show anything too radical, people are still waiting on the character
5207480	5212600	Osana, he seems more focused on other developments before moving on to that, and it's obvious the
5212600	5218120	video game is not going to be completed by the end of 2019. Given his commitments, that will likely
5218120	5223320	disappoint people. By the time many of you are watching this, it'll probably be 2020. Development
5223320	5227640	still seems relatively slow, there are probably people impatient with the progress, but Yandere
5227640	5232040	Dev at least has probably learned not to make promises he can't keep. There's no sign of the
5232040	5236040	crowdfunding project yet, so I guess we'll see how that will be received in due time.
5237000	5242040	The video game itself seems like an exhausting venture, given Yandere Dev's desire to retain a
5242040	5247000	lot of control, he clearly feels a commitment to finish it. He doesn't want to give up control
5247000	5252520	given his investment, it's the sunk cost fallacy. He has sunk an investment in, and he isn't willing
5252520	5257960	to give it up, or compromise easily on a creative vision in the hope that he will get there, and he
5257960	5263640	might get there. At the same time, continuing this will undoubtedly be a draining endeavour, and I
5263640	5268520	think it's a justified concern to posit whether the game will ever be finished given the scale
5268520	5273400	and ambition. I'm not here to fully write anything off, and I don't think it's a bad thing to follow
5273400	5277000	if you're just interested in watching the development, which I think is where a lot of
5277000	5282040	his current audience stands, but I'd advise caution in investing. With the current trajectory, it's a
5282040	5287720	risk you'd have to accept. The whole situation became weird to follow for me, because on the
5287720	5292200	one hand, Yandere Dev seemed to acknowledge that the people who may be rather extreme in their
5292200	5297160	behaviour towards him were part of a small minority, and yet he dedicated so much time and
5297160	5301880	attention to them, often causing a strident on the issue. He said that he was okay with criticism if
5301880	5306200	it was delivered in a constructive way, but constantly censored public criticism regardless
5306200	5310840	of tone, implying that he perceived even well-delivered criticism in bad faith. He acts
5310840	5316360	like he wants to be out of the drama, but keeps involving himself in it. He constantly said things
5316360	5321080	were taken out of context, but never really provided the context that would help his case out.
5321080	5325000	I know it's a wild bat, but the example that still sticks out to me was the one regarding
5325000	5330200	that clearly disgruntled fan who was annoyed about his mod. After going after him, Yandere Dev
5330200	5334920	said he doesn't regret it on the corresponding Reddit post. In his debunked post, he said he
5334920	5339640	often felt remorseful, but I don't think many people ever saw that, they just saw someone who
5339640	5345640	was belligerent and arrogant. In reality, I think Yandere Dev was just so incredibly
5345720	5351160	fragile over his public status that after the hostility backfired, he just went all out to
5351160	5356040	suppress criticism. He's stubborn, and a bit paranoid, and I don't think that's been to his
5356040	5361160	favour, often ending up in conflicts with people in his own audience. As the hype slowed down,
5361160	5365800	and the Patreons dropped out, he became more frantic. Although the more public nature of
5365800	5370360	Yandere Dev's involvement with drama has subsided, the censorship has not. There are a load of these
5370360	5375960	situations, but probably my favourite was a post criticizing Corona-Chan being removed, with a
5375960	5380360	person suggesting in the replies that they should just look to this other post for a more constructed
5380360	5384840	way to communicate this criticism, but that post has been removed as well. It seems rather
5384840	5388840	authoritarian, with the Dev and his admins becoming more and more obsessed with tracking
5388840	5393720	members' movements, including their participation in other servers and subreddits to read their
5393720	5398760	intentions. It feels a bit like a cult, to be honest, and I'm not gonna leave many warnings in
5398760	5402920	this video, because enough information is out there for people to make informed decisions,
5402920	5407800	but this sort of behaviour is gonna create a bubble which is bound to burst, and it's a really
5407800	5414040	bad idea. But why is this bubble being created in such a way? My hunch is that Yandere Dev had
5414040	5418760	troll distinguishing between fans legitimately frustrated about the development of the game,
5418760	5424440	and those he would class as concerned troll. People pretending to care about the game's best
5424440	5428840	interests but having slightly more negative intent. He felt that he was being targeted,
5428840	5433480	and he probably knew that well worded yet more biting criticism would do more damage than
5433480	5437960	anything else, so he tried to lump those people in with the harassers. The problem is that Yandere
5437960	5442440	Dev often went for false positives rather than false negatives, which led him to lashing out and
5442440	5448200	censoring people who may have genuinely cared about the progress of the game. 2015 and 2016
5448200	5453960	definitely saw controversy coming from his own attitude, 2017 saw the exposure of certain
5453960	5460120	technical failings, and 2018 saw an escalation in the arguments, frustration, and angst both
5460120	5465160	sides had, amounting in an eventual burnout of the drama when the fans simply told him that enough
5465160	5472760	was enough. Now in 2020, I guess we'll see how it all progresses. Do I think he's a bad person?
5472760	5477720	I don't know, but I do feel his arguments regarding the progress of the game and his abilities were
5477720	5482200	pretty poor. I also think his time management was exceptionally bad, I'm not sure if he knew
5482200	5486360	they were, or he genuinely believed that the game's complexity justified the amount of time
5486360	5490760	he had taken on it, but if he'd spent half the time arguing that he was working on the game,
5490760	5495480	well, working on the game, he'd probably get a lot more done. You have to accept that there will
5495480	5500920	be people who will go out of their way to hate you. Does it make it right? No. Does it mean you
5500920	5507000	should become equally invested in it? Also no, I'd also say that a lot of people had completely
5507000	5511480	valid quarrels with him, and although his intent may not have been outwardly malicious, it doesn't
5511480	5516040	undermine the grief caused by belligerence, rancor, or any other behaviours that can be
5516040	5520600	attributed to this curious character. I'd say it's probable that there were some people looking
5520600	5525320	to stir stuff up, but it's only because sharks smell blood, and when some of Yandere Dev's
5525320	5530200	behaviour and responses started coming to light, they saw a guy who they could bait into lashing
5530200	5535800	out and decimating his own image even further, and Yandere Dev just could never understand that.
5536520	5540920	You've probably forgotten when addressing his what's taking so long video, I said there was
5540920	5545000	one other option that we'd get back to. Well, let's talk about it. Actually,
5545000	5551160	I'll let Yandere Dev talk about it. Presently, Yandere Simulator is my full-time job.
5551720	5558360	I get paid to work on it. As long as I'm getting paid to work on it, I feel obligated to pour every
5558360	5564360	second of my life into it. As long as I'm getting paid for my time, it's perfectly fair for people
5564360	5574040	to complain if I don't make timely progress on the game. But, what if I wasn't getting paid to
5574040	5584040	work on it? What if I closed my Patreon completely, then I could downgrade Yandere Sim from a full-time
5584040	5592440	job to just a hobby? I would have no obligation to work on it for any longer than I feel like working
5592440	5600840	on it. I would have no reason to give it any more attention than I feel like giving it. I would
5600840	5610600	finally be able to play video games and watch anime again. Nobody could call me lazy anymore.
5611320	5621720	All of my problems would be solved. But, all of my fans would hate me. Someone else would
5621720	5629720	develop a Yandere-themed game to take the place of my game. I would fade from memory, and all of the
5629720	5637640	work I've done over the past three years would be for nothing. It's tempting to downgrade Yandere
5637640	5646920	Simulator to just being a hobby so that I can take my life back, but it would probably be a one-way
5646920	5653560	street with no turning back. Now, aside from the fact that he's playing Beethoven again, dude really
5653560	5659320	likes Beethoven, it may be too late now, but in 2017, this was the best option in my opinion, this
5659320	5664520	was the option that if I was a fan, I would have voted for. It's his choice, but if he's as
5664520	5669880	pressured as it appears, passing it on wasn't a bad idea. I think the main concern is that it's a
5669880	5674680	decision that he would not be able to revert, maybe he wants to prove people wrong by finishing the
5674680	5679560	game, but back then, I think a quarter of his audience understood. I tell him that he shouldn't
5679560	5684200	listen to polls alone, but he went with the option that only 5% of the audience voted for, so I can't
5684200	5689080	really say he did. Yandere Dev sees the source of his life in this community, that's the thing,
5689080	5694280	there's more to this world than a community. I get there's a concern that you fade from memory,
5694280	5700600	I get it too, but this is no way to be remembered. Yandere Dev and his game Yandere Simulator is the
5700600	5706200	perfect example of a social media-propelled video game when everything goes wrong. The obsession
5706200	5711240	with hype over practicality, the motivation to keep it online, the lack of expert consultation,
5711240	5717480	the lucky developer who was ill-prepared, and his volatile involvement with a passionate audience.
5717480	5722440	It led to criticism which then snowballed, and led everyone to lose out, and without his fanbase
5722440	5727000	just telling him to stop, it probably would have gone in the direction that he said it was going to.
5727000	5731880	This current route seems to be less destructive, and I am grateful for that, but I wonder if he's
5731880	5736120	really learned from his mistakes, or if he just learned to hide the glaring flaws a bit better.
5736840	5743080	Only time will tell. For now, he should be grateful that he has a relatively committed and open-minded
5743080	5748600	audience. In spite of all the antics, he's still doing okay, and if I were him, I wouldn't take that
5748600	5753880	for granted. For any other creators slash wannabe game developers, take this as a cautionary tale.
5753880	5757720	Regardless of who you think is right or wrong, there's a lot that can be learned.
5757720	5763320	Don't let usual drama cost you your life passion, it's not worth it, and don't think that everyone
5763320	5767960	is out to get you, even if it may hurt. I hope the game is worth it.
5770440	5775320	First things first, make sure you go and check out Thaf9, he does great video essays on games,
