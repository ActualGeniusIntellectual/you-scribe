00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,680
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:17,880
and as I'm sure many of you know, I am a gamer. It is a bonafide fact at this point. From my early period throwing knife

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:25,720
montages, to my entourage on GTA 5, my gaming skills are seldom equalled, and certainly not by anyone who I am covering today.

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:33,440
I am the epic gamer your parents tell you about, so you better hide your wife, and in true gamer fashion, we are going back to the world of video games,

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,320
with one of my most requested topics of all time, and that topic is Yandere Simulator, an anime based game.

6
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,720
Ah, anime, my favourite. What do people who like anime talk about?

7
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:54,360
Hello fellow anime watchers, uwu? I'm gonna level with you guys here. One of my most commonly asked questions is if I watch anime,

8
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:01,800
and although I have seen a couple movies when I was younger, Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, I haven't really had the chance to enjoy much of it.

9
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,840
Although I have heard great things, and I really do respect the art, some of it looks truly beautiful.

10
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:14,960
Now, anime has been relatively popular since the early 20th century, it obviously originated in Japan, and often represented the cultural zeitgeist.

11
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:23,000
The development of digital mediums has allowed the art to flourish and expand into new genres. One of those, of course, is the video game genre.

12
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:32,440
There are many anime video games, and it was in the video game heyday of the 1980s that anime inspired video games and video game inspired animes rose to prominence.

13
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:40,640
Since then, their popularity has continued to extend beyond their borders, with the style attaining international prestige amongst a variety of audiences.

14
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:48,120
I also want to take a moment to talk about manga, which is typically used to refer to comics and graphic novels, often created in the Japanese style.

15
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:54,280
Manga precedes anime, and although mangas may be made reflecting an anime style, they are by no means the same.

16
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,680
However, there is overlap, and that overlap can be demonstrated in many characterisations.

17
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,680
This is where we meet the yandere.

18
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:16,520
Yandere is a portmanteau, which is our word of the day, of the words yandere and dere dere.

19
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,880
Yandere meaning sick, and dere dere meaning infatuated, deeply in love.

20
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:31,160
So combined, you reach the lovely idea that a person is in love to a sick extent, they will do anything for their senpai, even if that means often less than charitable activities.

21
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:40,440
This personality trait is attributed to manga characters, however, it has gained popularity in anime as well, with many characters being modelled around that mould.

22
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:48,560
The psychotic behaviour, often paired with a cute design, and sometimes demeanour, seems to be a good contrast that has become quite the rave,

23
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:57,760
but it wasn't until one very cheeky game developer had a very cheeky idea, how about we make a whole video game from the perspective of a yandere.

24
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:05,320
That cheeky game developer was a person by the name of Alex Mahan, currently operating under the very fitting name of Yandere Dev.

25
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:12,200
He was an independent developer hailing from California, he has a degree in animation, and was previously known under the name Iba Zifon,

26
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:18,600
where he'd worked on the game of Lunar Scythe, however, in spite of receiving some initial interest within forums, it didn't come to fruition.

27
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:25,240
That was previously his most renowned project, but he has been a resident of the online world since the mid to late 2000s, working on various concepts.

28
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:31,880
One I found was a game called Shader, lots and lots of fun. It appears that Yandere Dev was a man with many ideas,

29
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,160
so let's talk about the idea that has brought us to this titular game.

30
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:43,400
He conceived the idea of Yandere Simulator in 2014, pitched it to the internet, and allegedly, after receiving positive feedback,

31
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,480
decided to initiate development starting a YouTube channel to document this development and progress.

32
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:55,000
The YouTube channel, like all channels, was a bit slow at first, but in perspective gained subscribers at a relatively rapid pace,

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,200
catapulting his content and the respective project into the public eye.

34
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:07,560
It wasn't too long before other large creators gave the game a burst of publicity, including PewDiePie, Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, and IHAS Cupquake.

35
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,800
Given its accessibility, even in the early stage of development, Yandere Simulator was pushed towards the spotlight,

36
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:21,000
and although it was not remotely near finished, many were more than willing to let this slide, considering that it was an independently funded venture.

37
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,120
And sometimes, true quality does indeed take time. He would typically upload content that would provide updates and ideas,

38
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,280
and was interactive on social media. However, it was a lot to do for one person.

39
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:39,640
With this in mind, in 2014, Yandere Dev also set up a Patreon to support this endeavour, and it gained a reasonable amount of donors,

40
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:45,960
at one point totalling $5,000 a month. With the production in full motion, new ideas ready to be worked on,

41
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,280
plenty of traction and support from the community members, and even the odd volunteer along the way,

42
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,800
everything seemed to be going perfectly fine. However, if it was a perfect story, we wouldn't be here today.

43
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:05,560
If you went by his YouTube channel, it's unlikely you'd see many issues. Yandere Dev has now amassed over 2.6 million subscribers,

44
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:12,720
his content appears to receive universally positive feedback from his audience, and his subreddit is a place of joy and epic anime memes.

45
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,680
But this hasn't changed the fact that there have been many videos equally well received, dishing out some hard hitting criticism,

46
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,280
and numerous threads outside of the Yandere Dev chamber.

47
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,680
You see, our friend Alex here seemed to have a lot of creative ideas, which definitely gave hope to the project on principle.

48
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,120
However, as time passed, in spite of the notion that these ideas were receiving support, many began to become frustrated

49
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,720
with the lack of progress being made on the game. One year passed, two years passed, three years passed,

50
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,000
four years passed, and people didn't feel like they were seeing results. Now, many games take a long time,

51
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,600
and with one developer, it was obviously not expected to be completed too quickly. Rome wasn't built in a day.

52
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:57,800
However, many began to challenge whether this project was comparable to Rome, or whether it was more of a, well, Pompeii,

53
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,880
with criticisms going after his management, development, and even basic ability in the pursuit of his vision.

54
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:10,360
There were a diversity of criticisms to cover on this front, but many also claim that Yandere Dev's response

55
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,400
was regularly documented to be lacking the filter that many creators may have when dealing with criticism.

56
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,960
This led to additional criticism for his demeanour and attitude, with many stating that his hostility,

57
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,280
and often censorious response to criticism, shows an arrogant and entitled side to him that he hadn't earned yet.

58
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,960
Others who defended him said his responses were just those by an individual under a lot of pressure to deliver a game

59
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,160
that has been weighing on him for a long time. Add this to a load of other drama regarding attitude and treatment

60
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,920
of those around him, responses, alleged harassment, all escalating in severity, and you ended up with a very messy

61
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:49,960
case indeed that came to a head in the year of 2018. If you're confused, don't worry, I'll do my best to get through all of it,

62
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,280
and maybe we'll make some more friends along the way.

63
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:58,680
Full disclosure, Faf9, my good collaborator friend, put out this tweet, which did significantly well in the

64
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,120
Twittersphere, and in a reply, he then stated that I was making this video, which led both Yandere Dev,

65
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,560
and a prominent critic of his to reach out to me. Overall, they had quite little impact on my script,

66
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,200
but as always, I will put it out there, and I will clarify that unless you're someone like Austin Jones,

67
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,520
I'm not here to bite your head off. There's going to be a lot of criticisms and opinions from me,

68
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,120
but as always, I encourage everyone to form their own. I'd also stress that some of this criticism is retrospective,

69
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,400
you'll know by the tense I use. There is no guarantee that individuals involved feel the same today about a lot of these things,

70
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,360
but these incidents have had a butterfly effect onto the current situation, and thus cannot be ignored.

71
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,960
Let's talk about the video game that was almost completely derailed by internet drama.

72
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,760
Ladies and gentlemen, it's Game Time.

73
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,880
Given that the root of this video is the game, and the origins, I think it's most appropriate that we begin there.

74
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,600
Yandere Simulator as a concept was conceived around the 2014 period.

75
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:02,040
Now at first, Yandere Dev was a one man band, working on the project. He may have had a lot of drive,

76
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:07,240
it's hard to tell completely. In a late 2014 interview with TechRaptor, he seemed to be pretty motivated.

77
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,560
He had some decent ideas of what he wanted to do with the game, even if they weren't fully realized,

78
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,480
but you don't exactly need them to be at that point. He also appeared to genuinely enjoy interactions with his audience

79
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,600
over the delightful medium of emails, stating that it filled him with joy. At the end of the interview,

80
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,080
he committed to making a game that would fulfill expectations and not let anyone down,

81
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,160
but that is easier said than done.

82
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:35,000
Projects on a large scale are always a challenge to an extent. You would inevitably go through periods of high and low

83
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,240
motivation. Developing a game is never an easy process, however, there are also things you can do to facilitate

84
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,920
the development of a game to maximize the efficiency, and to make sure you're able to turn out high quality

85
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,600
product in good time, without being sidetracked by menial issues. These are all important aspects of management

86
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,440
without even considering PR. PR meaning that you need to build hype, and turn out content that eventually

87
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,560
justifies the hype. Now, Yandere Simulator is clearly a neat concept that is popular with many people,

88
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:09,400
but it's also just a game, and given the fact that the developer hasn't exactly released any other acclaimed work

89
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:15,640
for people to build off, in spite of its popularity, a trust in this developer and his ability to deliver a game

90
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:21,240
has to be earned. With the almost immediate success of Yandere Dev, on principle, it seemed like there was a lot

91
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,600
to celebrate. When a concept is popular and takes off, you have a lot of momentum, and a lot of people and

92
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,040
businesses wanting to provide their services, however, if you're not prepared for this success, then it can yield

93
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:38,200
many problems for anyone. Probably one of the best examples of this is child stars. Now, children need to be

94
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,480
represented in media to an extent, and many of them deal with it reasonably well, however, for those who have been

95
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:49,080
thrown into the spotlight at such a young age, whether it was due to a hit song or an iconic film performance,

96
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,520
many don't deal with the sudden spotlight and pressure too well, many end up in rather uncharitable places.

97
00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:00,920
In many instances, it's the case of peaking so early and having so much pressure to maintain that, in other cases,

98
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,920
it's simply not being prepared for the responsibility the success brings. Although Yandere Dev is by no means

99
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:12,840
what one would consider a child star, the Yandere Simulator's spontaneous success was somewhat equatable,

100
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:18,280
and I don't think Yandere Dev was remotely ready for what it meant, not just as a creator, but as the

101
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:25,640
developer of a game. Although the 2014 origin was pretty relaxed, 2015 was met with a huge spike in attention,

102
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:32,040
with the aforementioned creators showcasing the game to millions of fans. Publicity can be premature,

103
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:39,160
and for Yandere Simulator, it was, let me explain why. As noted, the build-up of a game is partly about hype.

104
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,720
Typically, the discovery of a new game or a new piece of media will lead to a process where we either

105
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:50,040
discard that discovery and leave it behind, or we become more invested, and we fall down whatever rabbit hole that game has.

106
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,800
Nonetheless, it's unlikely our venture down that rabbit hole will last forever. Eventually, we will hit a wall where we can

107
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,400
no longer find any new information, and the information that we already know no longer engages us.

108
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:08,200
For some people, this takes longer than others, and in a way, that's alright. Now, when we hit that wall, we have one of two responses.

109
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:14,120
We can leave the source of what we know behind and continue with our lives, destined to fall down another rabbit hole eventually,

110
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,640
or we can try and obtain new information, by either creating it ourselves, or trying to get it from the creator.

111
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:25,640
This is often represented by the sentiment of impatience. I'll return to that soon, however, I want to make the point that although

112
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:31,640
Yandere Simulator was an interesting concept, and it was great that Yandere Dev had a lot of support in developing it initially,

113
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,600
Yandere Simulator wasn't developed enough to be deserving of the publicity it received.

114
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Yandere Dev had very ambitious ideas for the game. At the time of the game, although you could roam around and do a few actions,

115
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,400
some of which were fairly brutal and amusing in their shock value, there was no deeper substance.

116
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:55,320
This meant the game built hype almost immediately, yet off the back of mostly very superficial elements that wouldn't keep people engaged for a prolonged period.

117
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:01,800
With the hype and the influx of new donors on the Patreon, Yandere Dev felt the pressure to maintain that hype, but as said,

118
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:08,040
it's equally a PR job as it is a developer's job, so he liked to document progress, which is a time consuming venture.

119
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:15,240
In the short term, this was a sensible decision to make, but it could only work out long term if the decisions that he made were backed by his ability.

120
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:22,600
The decisions you make early on in the development of a game can have long term effects at a later stage, you're setting the foundations.

121
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:31,480
On top of this, as documented in a later video, any possible overhaul of the game seemed troublesome because the Dev was worried that doing that would kill the hype.

122
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:38,840
The game is only alive for as long as people are interested in it. If people lose interest in the game, it's dead.

123
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:50,600
If I release frequent updates, people will remain interested in the game. If I release updates slowly, people will lose interest in the game, and the game will get closer to death.

124
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:57,320
Given that So Made People had experienced the game in some capacity, he clearly saw it as a challenge to revive the hype if he lost it.

125
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,360
On the surface, Made People would just see him as trying to resell the same product, and wouldn't buy.

126
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:10,440
I'm not going to go into complete depth regarding why his decision to continuously work on the project, since to maintain hype was eventually what has fundamentally crippled it,

127
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:18,120
will cross that bridge when we reach it. However, as is inevitable, eventually, even if you're adding content, if there is no clear compilation of a plotline,

128
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:25,080
or overarching concept that people feel satisfied with, they will begin to become frustrated. Results are important.

129
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:31,960
This was a huge problem for Yandere Dev, as he clearly prioritised certain components, that although may have provided progress in the moment,

130
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:39,800
didn't necessarily provide the feeling of progress to his audience, particularly regarding the rivals, which to many was a significant selling point.

131
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:45,640
Many people began to hone in on the fact that they didn't feel that Yandere Simulator was making the progress that it should have,

132
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:52,680
with focus being overly centred on Tribual Matters and Easter Eggs. This led to a basically placebo-ed sentiment to progress.

133
00:13:52,760 --> 00:14:00,040
The project felt like it was moving forward, but not in the ways that people would want it to, and by 2016, people were becoming restless,

134
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,920
not just in the game's development, but in Yandere Dev's responses to these frustrations.

135
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,040
How did he handle them? Well, let's talk about it.

136
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:26,520
Now, Yandere Dev is an interesting person. His past shows that he was never the most socially apt, and when you watch his videos,

137
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:33,960
you receive the impression that he isn't a massive, people-loving extrovert, so it's clear that he wasn't used to this level of positive attention.

138
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:41,160
What this can do to a person is often varied, but given that he was always a bit of an oddball, the outcome wasn't exactly favourable.

139
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:47,640
It's hard to say exactly where the switch was flipped, but at any point the feedback he received was no longer universally positive,

140
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:54,120
he just stopped taking it with the decorum that one might expect him to, and when questions started being asked, they looked to you to answer,

141
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:00,760
and let's just say he didn't exactly provide the desired responses. Arrogant is a word I see used a lot, and honestly,

142
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:08,520
I completely understand why a lot of people had that opinion. Particularly in 2016, there are multiple screenshots of him being incredibly short-tempered,

143
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:15,960
with people who were making inoffensive to good faith criticism. He likes to use the word stupid a lot when describing anything he doesn't like,

144
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:21,800
which in the wrong context can come across as rather superior, he would regularly clash with fans and critics alike.

145
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:29,400
There was one situation where a fan was using a mod, and in response to this, Yandere Dev kicked them from the game and left him an interesting message.

146
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:36,680
Honestly, the video is a bit pissy, but it's obviously just a fan who's annoyed, and as videos go, it's fairly Marv Manut,

147
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:44,680
it'd be reasonably easy to diffuse as a creator who the fan probably looks up to. Instead, Yandere Dev responds by going on an angry diatribe

148
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:52,760
about how this guy's a dumbass, and he can f right off. When asked to justify this on Reddit, maybe saying it was just a heat of the moment thing,

149
00:15:52,760 --> 00:16:00,280
he stated that he was a passionate guy, he didn't really see any issue with that tone, because he's a person who puts his all into this game.

150
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:06,600
But it's not that simple, you can work hard on something, but that doesn't give you free license to be a colossal dick about it.

151
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:13,080
This is what people mean when they speak about arrogance, they mean this attitude that someone is entitled to behave in such a way,

152
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:18,440
because of a greater cause that they are participating, when those things are not connected at all.

153
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:25,960
You're not above certain principles of civility, and sometimes, as an adult, as a public figure, people will hold you to much tighter accounts.

154
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:33,000
This was a pattern with Yandere Dev, I could go all over these examples, but I'd just be repeating myself, he frames it as honesty,

155
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:41,560
and him speaking his mind, but being honestly unpleasant is still being unpleasant, from the position he was in, it came across as arrogance as well,

156
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,280
and as we'll find out later, when other people were unpleasant back to him, he didn't take it well.

157
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:52,920
Nonetheless, this isn't my favourite example, because eventually, he didn't just go from responding badly to audiences who were impatient,

158
00:16:52,920 --> 00:17:01,880
he went to blaming them altogether. Until recently, on the Yandere Dev wiki, it stated that Yandere Dev is best known for working really hard.

159
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:09,960
It's almost like Yandere Dev wrote it himself. Well, it's possible he did. However, as mentioned, many people have doubted that,

160
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:20,200
given the slow progress, but in 2016, he decided to finally explain what was holding him up. What was Yandere Simulator's biggest problem?

161
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:34,120
Well, you might be surprised. In this now removed video, Yandere Dev blames emails for the prevention of progress on the project. Yes, emails.

162
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:49,880
You're probably sick of hearing about it by now. I'm certainly sick of talking about it. I'd love to stop bringing up this subject, but that can only happen when it stops being the biggest problem I'm facing.

163
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,760
In fact, he stated that he spends 8-12 hours a day on them.

164
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:10,040
I receive an avalanche of emails every single day. Depending on how much email I get, sometimes I spend between 8 and 12 hours going through my email,

165
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,480
leaving me with no time left in the day to write code for the game.

166
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:23,640
Now, this is where the contradiction appears, because you must be thinking to yourself, well, these must be important emails if you spend so much time on them.

167
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,040
Well, they're apparently not.

168
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:42,040
When you send me a stupid email, you are actively sabotaging the game's development. If you want this game to come out faster, you should not email me unless it's absolutely necessary.

169
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:49,480
In fact, throughout the video, he brands a high majority of these emails as stupid. He goes through each category of stupid emails.

170
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:57,640
I do wonder how this video flew with anyone who isn't stupid, because there is no way that this makes any remote sense.

171
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:05,960
I strongly dislike this video, whether it's the floating screen demon, or his incredibly condescending tone, like he's talking to a bunch of 12 year olds,

172
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:16,200
though he might be, I don't know his audience. That's my feelings, but even feelings aside, this was about as watertight as the Titanic, post Iceberg of course.

173
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:27,160
The emails that I receive fall into five categories, volunteers, bug reports, questions, suggestions, and fan works.

174
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:33,640
I don't understand. Firstly, I'm surprised and somewhat skeptical that as many people as he said emailed him.

175
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:42,360
Secondly, if so few emails that you receive are worthwhile, although they can be irritating in the moment, what was stopping him from either not bothering to open them,

176
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:48,920
or just opening, seeing what it's about, and once they've been deemed stupid by his standards, closing them again.

177
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:55,960
Stupid emails should take less than ten seconds to check, and doing the maths, that means he was getting through a lot of emails in a day,

178
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,280
and I found it hard to buy that he was just engaging with every last one.

179
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:12,200
If someone volunteers to help me out, and they don't include any examples of their previous work, I immediately delete their email and move on to the next one.

180
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:23,320
I'm not going to waste my time typing an email that says, I don't know whether or not I want your help, I haven't even seen what your work looks like yet,

181
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,040
show me what your work looks like first.

182
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,800
Oh wait, he does that too, so he might just be held up by the volume of emails.

183
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:39,240
How many emails would he be receiving though? If he was receiving emails from so many people offering to volunteer, maybe he should have a volunteer for his emails.

184
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:46,200
The video seemed like a rather mean-spirited way for YandereDev to scapegoat his own audience as the reason for his shortcomings.

185
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:54,440
It's basic management, and blaming your audience because you can't handle it is just daft, implying that they are sabotaging the development.

186
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:04,200
It's ridiculous, making a simple request for less emails is fair enough, but telling people that sending emails is ruining the progress of the game is not just blatantly untrue,

187
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,800
but do you not know about the Streisand effects? Why would you bring more attention to your emails?

188
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:17,880
Pretty sure the Yandere Simulator demographic aren't the biggest users of that medium of communication, why would you remind them that it exists?

189
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:27,960
It's like Superman making a video about how people shouldn't bring Kryptonite near him, it's a waste of time, he wasted his time making a video about how emails are wasting his time.

190
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,800
Stop. Stop right there.

191
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:43,080
After two years of this nonsense, I've already heard every single possible suggestion about how I can solve my email problem.

192
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:50,440
There is no idea that you could possibly suggest that I haven't already shot down.

193
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:59,160
So don't send me your brilliant ideas for how to solve my email problems, because it's not going to work.

194
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:08,920
The only way you can help me solve my email problems is if you stop sending me emails.

195
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:13,400
You can see what part of time management I'm not really a fan of on his behalf.

196
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:20,200
Even if the video is not intended as a scapegoat, it's clear he cares too much about things that can be handled fairly easily.

197
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:28,200
As noted, he definitely has his limitations, however, capability to not spend whole days on going through emails should not be one of them.

198
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:35,960
Of course, he didn't recognise that, and after listing out all the ways you shouldn't email him, does actually address some of the rather unpleasant interactions that he's had.

199
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:45,240
However, he does it by making a monologue about how he's descending like some kind of anti-hero over Beethoven's number seven symphony as if the boy thinks he's slick.

200
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:55,160
You know, there was a point in time when I was a very nice and patient person.

201
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:07,800
But, working on this game for the past two years has been very stressful, and it has sucked all of the niceness out of me.

202
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:12,520
I no longer have any patience left.

203
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:19,160
I've started responding to emails using very harsh and abusive language.

204
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:37,480
I'm not proud of myself for doing this, and I'd like to stop, but it has become impossible to control my temper when I'm subjected to the same stupid garbage every hour of every day,

205
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:44,120
despite the fact that I constantly ask people to stop.

206
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:52,760
I'm only going to get grumpier and grouchier and angrier the longer this goes on.

207
00:23:52,760 --> 00:24:00,120
Please stop sending me stupid emails.

208
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:08,920
We all deal with stress in different ways, and it's okay to open up about these things, but Yandere Dev has a way of doing it that just seems to push blame onto other parties,

209
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:16,360
even those who may admire him, and he's just so unnecessarily irritable that it makes it very hard for others to empathise.

210
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:24,440
This was the first time it appeared that he had made a seemingly direct video addressing these issues, and it didn't give me hope for the coming years of research.

211
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,880
It seemed to lack a sense of responsibility and understanding of the life he's living, and what comes with it.

212
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,840
But it was about to get even deeper than that, but let's talk more about his time-wasting.

213
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:51,080
I think this was somewhat deeper than just that though, and I want to talk about the nature of time-wasting and why he was doing it.

214
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:59,560
Yandere Dev had a problem known as chronic justification syndrome. It is the motivation to respond to every single criticism,

215
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:05,080
and suggestion to give the impression to your audience that you are on top of everything, you are in control.

216
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:11,800
Do I think he's exaggerating in his emails video? For sure, I highly doubt he ever spent 12 hours a day on his emails,

217
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:17,080
but it wouldn't surprise me if he did go about responding to various people who didn't require responses.

218
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:22,920
There are more reasons for this that I'll also divulge soon. As a creator, you have to understand that with an increased audience,

219
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:28,840
you will undoubtedly not be able to respond to every single person who criticizes you, because it is terrible time management.

220
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:35,480
But also, unless you actively enjoy it, it's a mentally depleting activity once you reach a certain size,

221
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:41,160
so wrapping himself up making videos, going through emails, is obviously going to hold you up.

222
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:48,280
Yandere Dev clearly feared people having an image of him that he didn't desire, and therefore wrapped himself up in so much drama,

223
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:56,360
that it was almost laughable. Another heavily referenced example is this one where he exchanges an email with someone from the wiki admin team,

224
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:02,680
I think it was Yandere Dev Wiki. Once again, I don't know the exact context of this, so I can't say if he has a point or not,

225
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:10,280
but it doesn't sound like a particularly necessary problem. It's a case of control, he likes to control the narrative regarding how people perceive him.

226
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:16,600
This is probably because in 2016, he was called out for his previous persona, who went by the name of Eva Zifon,

227
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,960
I think that's how you pronounce it, though I could be wrong, and how this person had behaved in communities.

228
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,000
Honestly, regarding this whole discussion, there's a lot that I'm not going to hold against a person.

229
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,840
All I'd say is he's quite strange, and I think many people felt the details were a little discomforting.

230
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:38,040
There's a whole additional drama attached to this, which has been covered in some other very in-depth videos.

231
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:43,880
He used to be active on the delightful hub of 4chan, which is where he originally pitched the idea for Yandere Dev.

232
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,360
However, they had a field day with this situation and a fair few others, so now he hates them,

233
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:54,680
despite the fact that he made the quote, most anti-SJW game in existence, and they rejected him.

234
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,160
What a sad story.

235
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:03,160
There were a few more serious claims we'll briefly touch on now, most worryingly was the claim of pedophilia,

236
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,440
for which his response left me feeling a degree of confusion.

237
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:12,680
There's been a lot of discussion about whether he was in favour of certain less than palatable activities,

238
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,400
though he does seem to have clarified them now.

239
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,240
He also responded to the claim that he'd received nudes from an underage person,

240
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:25,560
and I mean, it's all rather incoherent, does seem like he's just adjusting a statement to the tune of the criticism he was receiving,

241
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,120
but there's not really too many more details to this.

242
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:33,480
There was one account against him, and although a detailed testimony, there's no verifiable physical proof,

243
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,160
so do with it what you will.

244
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:40,600
On top of this, there was a payspin detailing what is allegedly him trying to groom a younger individual,

245
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,680
but payspin's format doesn't make it a particularly reliable source, unfortunately.

246
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:51,400
Now, it's fair to say that Yandere Dev is a strange character, and his internet history is not flattering to say the least,

247
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:57,960
but it's also because of that that it's not entirely clear if or where the truth ends and the lies begin in this case.

248
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:04,520
We've seen a few situations where strange behaviour is escalated with additional claims that turn out to not be entirely true,

249
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:09,640
which is why it's hard to speak conclusively here, however there is something conclusive it can tell us.

250
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:16,280
Simply put, with all these old posts and new claims floating around, it would likely make Yandere Dev fairly paranoid,

251
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:21,720
and explain why he may have felt the need to constantly defend himself, because he wanted to stomp out criticism,

252
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,160
and to quote, debunk the narrative while it was still fairly fresh.

253
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,560
He didn't want it becoming the predominant perspective, though, as noted by this volunteer,

254
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,680
it's probably worth remembering when considering working under him.

255
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:43,000
If 2014-2015 was the high, 2016 was the hangover. Yandere Dev did not seem to coherently understand both sides of popularity.

256
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:52,680
He had appeared to have faced these claims back in 2015, but it seems that people didn't really clock how this was affecting development of Yandere Simulator until early 2016.

257
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:57,560
But okay, if his behaviour was not how to deal with criticism, how should he deal with it?

258
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,480
It's important to remember the source of the impatience, the game itself.

259
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:09,640
The fact is that regardless of whether Yandere Dev was a good or bad person, a sensational majority of the fanbase just wanted the game,

260
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,720
and there will always be a small minority who will criticise you for other things.

261
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:20,760
Now when you become successful, you need to adapt to that success, that's something that Yandere Dev clearly couldn't understand,

262
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:26,680
because although he had hired volunteers, and made a commitment on his Patreon that he'd be hiring volunteers after a certain amount,

263
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:35,400
which he did hit at one point, given his lofty ambitions, he clearly didn't have a grip on balancing the outsourcing, and what he wanted to talk about himself.

264
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:41,320
One of the problems here is that Yandere Dev was, and maybe still is, rather possessive over his game.

265
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:47,160
This is probably why he lashed out at people suggesting changes sometimes, or criticising the choices that he made.

266
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,600
It certainly doesn't justify it, but it makes a little more sense.

267
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:57,880
However, being possessive also means wanting to retain creative control to a large extent, you want to see your game developed how you would like it,

268
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:05,960
I understand that, but if you spend so much time working on your own image, of course you're not gonna have anywhere near enough time to actually focus on the game,

269
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:12,200
and this meant that even if changes were being made, the fact that Yandere Dev was in control meant there was a lack of pace.

270
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,320
However, was that about to change?

271
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:23,480
You know, at the right opinion, we are forgiving. I think it's important to let people have the opportunity to grow, as long as you haven't done anything too grim.

272
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:29,480
It's not too late for a redemption arc, and following the Yandere Dev story, at one point you would've thought we might get it.

273
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:35,960
Now, email bollocks aside, the root of the problem that anyone could draw from what we've looked at so far was organisation.

274
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:44,280
It's clear that given the output, if it wasn't laziness, which, you know, I'll entertain for the benefit of the doubt's sake, he clearly wasn't handling it well,

275
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:49,240
and at the start of 2017, this seemed to be an issue that he was finally coming to terms with.

276
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:59,960
Let's talk about the speed of Yandere Simulator's development, the obstacles that are slowing down development, and potential solutions that could speed things up.

277
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:07,800
I mean, obviously it's a complex discussion on principle, we know that Yandere Dev hires volunteers, so he's not necessarily doing this alone,

278
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,400
and those volunteers are quite involved with the creation of the game.

279
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:19,560
90% of the things that you see and hear in Yandere Simulator would never have been possible without the help of those talented people.

280
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,880
However, all of these amazing assets come at a cost.

281
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,560
I am the game's director, producer, and manager.

282
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:32,760
I am also the lead artist, and the lead animator, modeler, composer, etc.

283
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:42,840
I don't create artwork or animations or models or music, but I am in charge of managing and directing all of the people who produce those things for Yandere Simulator.

284
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,880
I am also the game's only programmer.

285
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:55,000
I must perform all of the responsibilities that would normally be performed by about 10 different people if this was a real game company.

286
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,480
In spite of this, he is still heavily involved in managing each area.

287
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:08,120
As the director and the manager, he needs to make sure it comes together to make a cohesive vision, something that on principle I do empathise with.

288
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:13,720
This is covered extensively in parts 1 and 2 of a set of videos that cover the delays of the game,

289
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,720
and exactly how he plans on resolving those problems.

290
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,960
Wow, we were making progress.

291
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,360
So how did he resolve those problems?

292
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,720
Let's talk about it.

293
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:39,480
In a pair of videos at the start of 2017 titled What's Taking So Long?,

294
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,080
he responds to the rhetorical question that many of his audience have asked.

295
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:48,680
However, he doesn't throw any tantrums, he doesn't lose his cool, nor does he try and pin it on emails.

296
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:54,040
He explains the problems of his job, and how they and other factors influence how he manages his workload,

297
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:58,520
so in a final, deeper analysis of his problems, he looks at a few solutions.

298
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,560
In the past, I placed a strong emphasis on low-hanging fruit,

299
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:09,720
in other words, features that could be implemented within two weeks, with minimal assistance from volunteers.

300
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:16,280
So, for a long time, I was able to add significant new features to the game every two weeks,

301
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,720
but eventually, I ran out of low-hanging fruit to implement.

302
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,880
The next step was to work on the medium-hanging fruit,

303
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:29,240
which required more collaboration with volunteers, and more programming work than before.

304
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:34,840
This is when features started to take four weeks, or several months, to implement.

305
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:41,480
The fruit that I am aiming for now, Osana Najimi, is the highest fruit on the tree,

306
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,360
and requires me to spend extensive amounts of time speaking with volunteers,

307
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,200
which leaves me with almost no time to actually write code.

308
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,400
Now, some may question some of the statements that he makes in this video,

309
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,640
particularly pertaining to his workload, and those questions would be completely justified,

310
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,400
but whether he was being honest or not,

311
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,840
he at least seems to grasp that the current rate of progress is unsustainable.

312
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:09,000
Even though I devote almost every single hour of my life to Yandere Simulator,

313
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:15,960
I've made zero code-related progress on Osana over the past two weeks,

314
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:21,880
because of all the other things that take up my time and require my attention.

315
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:27,640
I have no problem managing a team of people, and I enjoy programming,

316
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:32,760
but there simply aren't enough hours in the day to manage a team of people

317
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,560
and make significant progress with the game's code.

318
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,360
I think that the most elegant solution would be to hire someone

319
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,960
to take my place as the game's lead programmer,

320
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:49,880
so that I can focus exclusively on being a director slash producer slash manager,

321
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,120
while someone else writes all the code.

322
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,360
I have specialties,

323
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:59,640
but I don't specialize in most of the stuff that Yandere Simulator needs the most.

324
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,080
I put forth my best effort,

325
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:08,360
but if a more experienced programmer had been in charge of writing Yandere Simulator's code,

326
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,920
they probably would have done a bunch of things way differently.

327
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:17,000
The general tone of this video outlines that he's going to begin making inquiries

328
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,480
regarding the outsourcing of various tasks,

329
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,880
so he doesn't have to manage everything himself.

330
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,120
He's seriously contemplating handing over control in executive areas.

331
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,760
That, for many developers, may be a brave move,

332
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,680
but it was a necessary move to him,

333
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,960
because by keeping the production public and the game accessible,

334
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,960
he had a pace that he had to maintain,

335
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,640
and if he felt like he couldn't stop,

336
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,560
it would not only sacrifice the speed of development, but the quality as well.

337
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,840
However, how he would hand over control is another question.

338
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,480
Let's discuss the possible methods that he presented.

339
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,720
The first one was a crowdfunding campaign.

340
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,800
Yandere Dev was planning to do a crowdfunding campaign at some point in the future regardless.

341
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,520
This plan merely involved moving the campaign forward,

342
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,080
and hiring a team to work on the project earlier.

343
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,280
Now, there are positives to this,

344
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,040
such as the fact that it allows him to retain control over the greater product,

345
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,280
even if he's assigning roles to other people.

346
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,600
This would allow work to be completed faster,

347
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,360
and maintain hype for the upcoming game while staying in line with his model.

348
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,760
Nonetheless, it's also possible that at this point,

349
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:19,080
people would feel insulted that he is once again asking for money on top of his Patreon,

350
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,600
and the amount they've been waiting already would not justify this.

351
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:27,160
The crowdfunding campaign was something he really should have been doing back in 2014.

352
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,600
It's also possible that he may not have been able to raise the money at all,

353
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,480
and that may be quite embarrassing for him as a developer.

354
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,280
I could forget about Osana,

355
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,760
launch the crowdfunding campaign immediately,

356
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,880
assemble a team,

357
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,840
begin refactoring the game's code as soon as possible,

358
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,600
and then release Osana after the refactoring was complete.

359
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,680
But I'm not sure if you guys would really want this.

360
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,760
The second solution was that he contracts with another company to finish the game.

361
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,760
The benefits of this were that he wouldn't have to ask for money from the audience,

362
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,880
and thus avoids them receiving the impression that he's exploiting them,

363
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,440
and he has the stability of a larger business supporting him

364
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,320
if he ever feels like he can't hold up the project himself.

365
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,480
It's more of a mutual support system.

366
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,400
Nonetheless, this came with its own problems,

367
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,560
particularly if this was done over contract.

368
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,320
Giving up certain creative controls may lead to the sacrifice of one's vision,

369
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,280
something that Yandere Dev was notoriously possessive over.

370
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,800
It also led to being bound into a contract that, under strain,

371
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,040
may cause the whole project to collapse.

372
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,840
Throughout this video, Yandere Dev clearly paints himself as very skeptical towards businesses.

373
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,320
I've already been approached by multiple companies

374
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:40,600
who have expressed an interest in getting involved with Yandere Simulator's development

375
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,000
in exchange for a cut of the game's profits.

376
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:49,960
They've proposed deals that involve me giving up 50% of the game's profits,

377
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:54,280
or losing ownership of the game's intellectual property,

378
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,160
or removing certain features from the game.

379
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,400
These terms are all very unappealing to me.

380
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,480
So it seems that whatever option he wants to choose,

381
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,280
there is a degree of reservation regarding them.

382
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,640
That was a lot of pressure, but at the end of it all, it was an ultimatum.

383
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,760
If Yandere Dev continued to try and do the project alone,

384
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,600
the time it would take for the video game to be released anyway would kill the hype regardless,

385
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,080
so he stated that he was prepared to take the plunge.

386
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,680
There was one more option that he presented, but I'm gonna save that for later.

387
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,000
Yandere Dev conducted a poll with these options,

388
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,440
and the fandom decisively backed him to remain on the current trajectory.

389
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,240
But the problem was, although preferable to many, maybe even to Yandere Dev himself,

390
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,600
it wasn't sustainable.

391
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:39,160
Yandere had continuously committed to wanting the game released by 2019,

392
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,400
and there was no scope of that happening if he continued in the current direction.

393
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,400
However, was this all smoke and mirrors,

394
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,800
or was he going to follow through on a commitment for once?

395
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,360
Well, not too long after, he posted a video which announced

396
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:54,120
that Yandere Simulator was about to enter a collaboration phase.

397
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:59,160
Alongside this, the criticism of the companies in the previous video had been reeled in a little.

398
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,400
During this part of the video, I portrayed companies as evil,

399
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,680
greedy entities that would steal money from me,

400
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:11,080
take full possession of Yandere Simulator, and censor the game.

401
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,600
It was a bad idea to portray companies like this,

402
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,600
because not every game developer or game publisher is like that.

403
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,720
The language that I used to describe companies in my previous video

404
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:28,920
probably had a strong effect on the poll where I asked people what they wanted me to do.

405
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,800
Let me take a moment to talk about companies in a non-biased way.

406
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:39,640
Over the past two weeks, I've spent a lot of time speaking with a company

407
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,320
that has experience developing games, publishing games,

408
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:49,000
and also working together with struggling developers to help them finish their games.

409
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,640
This company has a very good reputation among indie devs,

410
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,640
and their name came up numerous times when I asked other developers

411
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,880
to recommend a good company to work with.

412
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,400
When I asked people for their opinion on this company,

413
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,920
nobody was able to tell me a single negative thing about them.

414
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,920
Yandere Dev had made a decision to go towards a publisher or developer

415
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,920
rather than a crowdfunding project.

416
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,560
Who though?

417
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,360
Well, a publishing company named TinyBuild.

418
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,640
TinyBuild are an independent games company based in Washington,

419
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,000
the state, not the city.

420
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,720
Well, there are multiple cities named Washington, but you know what I mean.

421
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,600
They're the developers of the game, no time to explain,

422
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,320
however they've also published games from all over the globe,

423
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,840
and you've probably heard of some of them.

424
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,240
TinyBuild was probably one of the better options,

425
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,880
they have experience and credit within the industry,

426
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,480
however they're not too corporate,

427
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,000
and that might lend to some more trust between the collaborators in question.

428
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,320
Yandere Dev himself was very optimistic,

429
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,840
stating that he'd never heard about any bad experiences with the company,

430
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,320
and that many had recommended them to him.

431
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,200
His partnership with TinyBuild would assure many new developers

432
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,920
coming onto the game and working under his management.

433
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,960
He would still be the lead designer, he would still have the final say,

434
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,440
there was no power being taken away from him.

435
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,520
The only catch was that there would be no content

436
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,920
that may provide it with an adults-only rating,

437
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,880
but that was something that he had anticipated regardless.

438
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,520
Overall, the plan was for TinyBuild to take over many of the more business-related matters

439
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:16,360
on top of the development aspects that Yandere Dev felt like he was weaker in.

440
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:22,200
I have no experience hiring people, drafting contracts, trademarking things,

441
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,400
or any of the other business-related or law-related aspects of game development.

442
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,440
I'm good at making prototypes and implementing low-hanging fruit very quickly,

443
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,240
but I'm not really experienced enough to write complex character AI,

444
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,560
or do some of the other complicated things

445
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,680
that are needed to make Yandere Simulator become a reality.

446
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:48,440
So it makes perfect sense for me to partner up with a company like TinyBuild,

447
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,640
and let them handle all of the things that I'm bad at,

448
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,760
while I focus only on the things that I'm good at.

449
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:59,320
Yandere Dev also clarifies that this partnership mostly covers creative resources,

450
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:03,720
rather than monetary funding, thus although crowdfunding may still be a possibility,

451
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,320
he would eventually charge people to play the alpha version of the game

452
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,360
once he considers it complete enough to begin charging.

453
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,800
This is a decision that he would make after he had finished Osana.

454
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,600
He also said he would not be changing much monetarily,

455
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:21,000
and YouTube ad revenue alongside Patreon was still his only sources of income.

456
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,720
However, one of the most significant developments was that TinyBuild

457
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,960
would be providing Yandere Dev with a programmer

458
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,720
who would sort out a new code for the game, while he was working on Osana.

459
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,800
Progress would be slow at first, but eventually,

460
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,680
as according to this very professional graph,

461
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,800
the pace would pick up as TinyBuild take over more assets,

462
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,920
leaving Yandere Dev to focus on his executive role.

463
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,000
Wow, like a jigsaw, it was all finally falling into place.

464
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,720
Except it didn't, it kinda failed.

465
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,480
Well, yeah, but we're meant to build up the tension.

466
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,960
Yes, I'm sure your viewers are on the edge of their seat waiting for me to pop up, aren't they?

467
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:00,200
What we're supposed to do is talk about coding. Do you know about programming?

468
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,560
I'm a gamer first and foremost, and I always will be.

469
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,160
Huh, I don't see you as the gaming type.

470
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,040
Okay then, let's talk about the failure of the TinyBuild partnership, shall we?

471
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:15,240
A game development cycle is the most turbulent time of the year.

472
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,400
There's a saying when it comes to game development,

473
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,440
if all else fails, hire someone to do the job for you,

474
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,920
and then reap all the benefits for being a sole developer

475
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,120
while leaving the poor person in the dust to become a ghost in the industry.

476
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,600
I made that one up.

477
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,680
But the point is that it's extremely rare for someone to work on a massive game completely

478
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,920
and utterly on their own with no assistance whatsoever,

479
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,560
and when someone does and releases it to a wide audience,

480
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:41,800
there's a chance that it could turn out really, really good, or really, really bad.

481
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,920
I've talked about this in my own video, but for the uninitiated,

482
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,040
Yandere Simulator is a game that runs on the Unity engine.

483
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,440
Before you get your superpowered panties in a twist, I'm not slating the Unity engine itself,

484
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,840
games that are made on the Unity engine, like any other engine, all have varying degrees of quality.

485
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,320
You only notice the bad asset flips because the developers didn't have enough money to

486
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,840
remove the watermark at the beginning of the game and have to hang their heads in shame as

487
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:09,880
the dreaded grey screen shows up saying that yes, this game is indeed made on the Unity engine.

488
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,040
Going back to Yandere Simulator, and the most common complaint about the game was that it

489
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:18,280
runs like an athlete in co-op, but he's got a third leg protruding from his stomach and he

490
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,840
runs by constantly front flipping down the track, and the buttons also included the mouse keys on

491
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:27,800
the side. The game was horrible to run, even on a beast rig. Loading up into the lobby and you're

492
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,560
greeted with less frames than viewers on the standard mixer stream and all you could really

493
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:36,040
do to keep your PC from pricking itself was look at the floor. Of course this spells problems for

494
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:40,200
the casual player with a less than stellar PC and significant lack of YouTube money,

495
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,880
as opening the game would open your entire town to nuclear destruction.

496
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,800
There are quite a few reasons why this is an issue, especially in Yandere Simulator,

497
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,400
but the biggest one goes down to the way the game is being programmed by the dev.

498
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,640
If you looked at the game without any knowledge as to its background or how it was even created,

499
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,720
you'd probably think that it could easily run on a calculator, but if you played it, you'd probably

500
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:04,520
be lucky to get a frame in. But why is this? I touched upon this in my own video, but if there

501
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:09,640
was one thing Yandere Dev wasn't really the best at, it was programming his game properly to work

502
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:14,200
efficiently and on all devices. The code looked like a complete nightmare. It was like the whole

503
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,360
concept of variables was unheard of to him. Before you guys brandish your pitchforks and call for my

504
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:22,760
public execution for being mean about his coding when he never had any experience before, let me

505
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:27,480
explain why a lot of people take a big issue with his programming. Yandere Simulator has been in

506
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:32,360
active development for about 5-6 years, and he's been programming the game the entire time when he

507
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:36,840
wasn't livestreaming video games or making more videos explaining the law. He's being paid the

508
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,840
same wage, if not more than professional programmers who by now would have completely

509
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:45,000
finished the game and done several patches to it and released it on the Nintendo Switch and

510
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,560
Nokia brick. He's commented that he knows his code looks awful and that he only codes on areas

511
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:53,960
that aren't used frequently. If he's saying that, then that means he clearly knows how to code

512
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:58,680
properly so why isn't he doing it? The code looks like a complete mess! In the code he uses the

513
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:02,680
update function, and he fills it to the brim with things that the game will do at that specific

514
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:07,320
point. The problem is that with this function, said things would run every single frame.

515
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:11,560
I can go into more detail about the coding but several programmers have made comments and points

516
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,640
about it, so I'll leave notes about what the professionals say were troves so he can add it

517
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:19,880
to the really really large amount of sources that's been compiled for the video. Now where

518
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:24,600
does TinyBuild come in? TinyBuild offered to extend their services to Yandere Dev as any

519
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:28,200
professional programmer would look at the code that he's done and projectile vomit all over

520
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,360
the screen. Initially reluctant to have another programmer do a better job than him, he eventually

521
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:36,600
caved and a developer was sent to work on the game, with TinyBuild hopping on board to publish

522
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:40,680
the game should it get released. Good coding is meant to be flexible, quick and efficient,

523
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,600
so that when needed, you can make quick optimisation edits and make sure the game

524
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:49,640
doesn't murder your Intel Atom processor from 1923. This is what the TinyBuild developer ended

525
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:54,120
up getting up to, optimising hundreds of lines of code to make sure that the game runs slightly

526
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:58,360
better than it did before that point, which meant removing the depressing amounts of else-if

527
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:02,360
arguments in the code. The partnership lasted a while with the programmer allegedly redoing

528
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:06,600
most of the code of the game, until he was suddenly dropped with a statement made on Yandere Dev's

529
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,600
Patreon, pretty much saying that the code couldn't be read because it was too simplified and there

530
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:15,080
was a lack of else-if statements to boot, as it would hinder the progress of him making his game.

531
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:19,640
At this, TinyBuild packed their bags and left the project, probably not seeing a completion date for

532
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:23,880
the game this decade or even century. With their departure and the programmers yeeting off the

533
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,920
project, Yandere Dev was now free to execute an extra 2048 lines of code in a single update

534
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,400
function to run every single frame, and finish his plan to cause global warming all over again

535
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,800
and raise the overall heat of the earth with the amount of fried PCs the game would end up causing

536
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:42,040
over the next few years. But this wasn't the only thing that Yandere Dev had been accused of

537
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:47,000
neglecting, nay, he had more trouble under his belt that even more information has been shown

538
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:53,240
as recent as a week before writing this segment, and that heinous crime is… stealing assets.

539
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:58,360
Allegedly, it's been stated that he's been stealing assets for his game, and while I

540
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:02,120
wouldn't put it past him to do such a thing, I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt

541
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:06,360
in this situation. Throughout the entirety of the development cycle of the game thus far,

542
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,960
Yandere Dev has promised that the models and assets that are currently in the game

543
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,120
will be replaced down the line with more polished models from the ground up. The very model for the

544
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:18,120
main character of the game is taken straight out of the Unity Asset Store, and quite a lot

545
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:21,480
of the assets around the school were taken from various places from the internet. Now,

546
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,880
standard development practices list that without a license or specific written permission from the

547
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:30,680
owner of the assets as well as credit, you cannot monetize your game whatsoever. You just got caught

548
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:35,160
using that one font that you downloaded from DaFont years ago on a used Parkbench asset that

549
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:39,320
you forgot even existed? Well too bad, someone found it and now you're thousands of dollars

550
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:43,720
in debt and your games keep banned from every single marketplace ever conceivable. Now Yandere

551
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,960
Dev didn't want any of this to happen to his game, he was planning on making big bucks and

552
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:53,400
selling it on the biggest marketplaces known to man… and the Epic Game Store, so he promised that

553
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,800
the models of the game would change down the line. Now you guys must've heard from either me or Tro

554
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:03,080
earlier on that Yandere Dev makes use of volunteers to keep the game going on, he isn't a one man band,

555
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:07,560
a man needs help! And what better way to get help than with people who are sacrificing their free

556
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:11,880
time in order to provide you with some assets to improve your game? Which is exactly what one

557
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:16,840
artist did for him. On Twitter, an artist named Sozomeika recently made a thread unearthing the

558
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:21,240
turbulent tales of her encounters with the Dev. She had improved the character designs of the game

559
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:25,320
to make them 50 times more original than the original concept, providing concept art for

560
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:30,040
Yandere-chan amongst other things. She states that she was asked to modify the in-game model,

561
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:34,280
design posters, illustrate his YouTube skits, redraw another artist's work because he didn't

562
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:39,880
like the quality, design skins and contribute some props. Now you're probably thinking to yourself,

563
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:44,440
that's a whole lot of work, surely she didn't do all of it? Well she ended up doing the entire

564
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:48,520
thing and submitted it. Now before you get your pitchforks out again and blast the artist for

565
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:52,760
working for free, you guys need to understand that at the time she was still a teenager,

566
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:57,000
and worked on multiple jobs in addition to trying to build her online presence and portfolio. And

567
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,360
besides, it was the perfect opportunity to work with THE Yandere Dev… just as long as she got

568
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:06,760
credit. The video was released and to the shock and horror of a grand total of no one, there was

569
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:11,640
no credit in the video. She had to email Yandere Dev to get credit for the work she did, and when

570
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:17,800
she asked he told her no, citing nepotism as a reason. In this thread, Maika also shows the

571
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:22,120
emails that Yandere Dev sent her, and I'll just present these without comment. Discounting the

572
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:26,600
melodramatic nature of some of these emails, why does there need to be a back and forth about this?

573
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:31,320
Just credit the artist? Other games don't seem to have this issue so I don't understand what the

574
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:36,360
problem is here, especially if the artist didn't ask for payment or anything, just credit. The work

575
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:40,920
that was handed to her was very intense and that's enough work for a full-time freelancer gig,

576
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,760
so the fact that she didn't ask for money in the first place makes it even more essential

577
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:49,560
that you give her full credit for the work she did, immediately on publication. All in all,

578
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:53,720
the rampant mismanagement of the game seems to never end, and hopefully there's going to be

579
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:59,960
some improvements to the way the game is run… yeah I'm not too sure about that one, but at

580
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,120
least this was a fun revisit to the antics of Yandere Dev. Back to you in the studio!

581
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:34,520
That's gonna be a massive yikes from me. Yandere Dev was never particularly well trained in the

582
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:38,840
area of development, although he described himself as strong at implementing the quote

583
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:43,960
low hanging fruit. This was probably simply because it was something he was capable of doing

584
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:48,520
using a less than ideal method. In some future posts, he said that he couldn't talk about the

585
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:53,080
deterioration of his partnership with TinyBuild, although he later said something, so I'm not sure

586
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:57,480
what the terms of his legal contracts were. In summary, it appears that Yandere Dev had

587
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:02,600
compatibility issues with a more efficient system, and I think that can be a problem. He would often

588
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:07,640
go on in the future to frame it as a subjective difference, despite admitting to being poor at it

589
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:13,000
in previous videos, and I don't think it's merely creative differences, so let me explain.

590
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,680
Okay, so, I play squash. It's a fun game. For most squash players who want to win matches,

591
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:23,240
there are a general set of principles that your style of play should adhere to. We all have

592
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:27,480
personal touches that help us develop our own brand, but at the end of the day, if you play

593
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:32,760
in a style that is too incompatible with the game of squash, chances are you won't win the game.

594
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:37,880
This is a general principle that you can follow into most professions and hobbies. Creating a

595
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:43,320
video game stems from the same general rules. It is likely that we have our own personal flair

596
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:48,200
and approach, but there are general rules that will alter the outcome in a possibly favourable

597
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:53,480
and unfavourable way with your audience. At the end of the day, the only person I'm playing a squash

598
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:59,480
game for is me. There is no one else out there who is invested in my performance, so I'm not expected

599
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:04,920
to perform. However, if I was contracted, or if I was playing for a league team, I think it'd be

600
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:09,960
reasonable for me to adhere to a few rules to make sure that my performance in the task was somewhat

601
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:15,000
efficient. Now, Yandere Dev could develop a game how he wanted to on principle, however, he also

602
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,760
had a lot of people who had an implanted expectation based on industry standards, and given that he was

603
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,920
often appealing to that audience for the funding and support, you'd think he would have been more

604
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:29,800
focused on delivering. When his initiative received a groundswell of support in 2014,

605
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:33,720
what he should have done is worked out how to improve his skill at programming before then

606
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:37,640
working out how to develop the game in a constructive way rather than basing his

607
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:42,360
developments off what would build the most hype and just doing it his own way, which only postponed

608
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:47,320
the eventual confrontation of the unfinished game. When a solution had finally been calculated,

609
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:51,880
almost three years after the development began, his previous approach to creating a game made

610
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:56,360
working with what he had incredibly difficult, and his prevailing stubbornness when presented

611
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:00,680
with a possible solution eventually prevented the progress that may have been achieved.

612
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:04,920
It reminds me of an old post he made where he turned some hard coding feedback he received

613
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:10,520
from his idol into a Batman's origin story. I turned the hatred into a burning passion.

614
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:15,240
It's a dark post, and he did actually admit he was wrong in 2015, so I'm not going to

615
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:20,360
hold it against him, but I don't think he thought about the feedback enough because we ended up in

616
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:24,680
this mess regardless. It's hard to fully empathise with him, because to me it seems

617
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:29,720
he must have apprehended these problems in advance and pushed on regardless. Instead,

618
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:34,520
by going for the quote low hanging fruit, it meant that the problems with his style didn't become

619
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:39,480
apparent until after a significant amount of development had taken place, because he was so

620
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,120
focused on that, and it pushed to a point where it was much harder to reverse, to the point where

621
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:49,000
Tiny Build couldn't continue. Yandere Dev himself was too stubborn to learn how to adapt, and the

622
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:55,000
progress of the game suffered for it. However, living in this world of denial, come 2018,

623
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,360
he decided that actually all these factors that are basically self-evidential at this point were

624
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:06,440
not to blame, and he had his own theory. In another condescending video, I don't know how

625
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:11,800
he does it with that tone, called How Long Does It Take To Make A Video Game?, he presents his own

626
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:17,560
version of events. How long does it take to make a video game?

627
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:25,720
The answer is, it depends on a large number of different factors, such as the genre, the budget,

628
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:31,880
the size of the team, the complexity of the game, whether it's an original game or an imitation,

629
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,880
and a bunch of other factors that you probably wouldn't have considered.

630
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:42,840
It's not an exact science, you can't really create a formula that tells you exactly how

631
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:48,680
long a game should be in development for, because each game has a different set of circumstances.

632
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:52,760
Let's break down the main points of the video, then. The first one is that the length that a

633
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:57,000
video game takes to be developed typically corresponds to the quality. He once again

634
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,280
used a very compelling graph to demonstrate this, and although obviously it's quite easy to pick out

635
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:06,520
the low sample number he uses, and the fact that obviously it would not be difficult to cherry

636
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:11,800
pick this at all, as a point, it's much easier to focus on the implication that somehow this,

637
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:18,200
as a universal rule, can be applied to his game, even though he specifically opened with the

638
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:22,920
statement that there were no specific formulas for the completion of a game.

639
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:28,520
So we've established that the more complex a game is, the longer it's going to take to develop it.

640
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:34,840
Small teams usually stick to simple games. When a small team tries to make a large,

641
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:39,240
ambitious game, the development can really stretch out for a long time.

642
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,240
Do you see where I'm going with this?

643
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:47,160
After asserting that games that are longer in the making are

644
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:50,680
typically higher in their complexity, particularly when they are comprised of

645
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:54,600
smaller development teams, he goes on to say that the complexity of his game,

646
00:56:54,600 --> 00:57:00,920
Yandere Simulator, is comparable to a Hitman game combined with a Persona game.

647
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:06,520
He then goes on to expand on all the complexities of this game, and I'm not particularly sold.

648
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,800
First, as the complexity of a project increases,

649
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,920
it will become proportionally difficult to work on it.

650
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:18,600
Every time you add a new feature, it will affect other features, create new bugs,

651
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:22,680
increase the amount of time you need to spend waiting for the code to compile,

652
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:28,840
increase the loading times of the game, etc. Something that was simple and easy to work on

653
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:33,800
at the beginning can eventually become a nightmare that you are constantly wrestling with,

654
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:39,640
where making even the smallest amount of progress becomes very time consuming and difficult.

655
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:44,680
It's hard to deny that Yandere Simulator is an ambitious game in many ways, however,

656
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:50,040
I certainly wouldn't say it's almost as complex as two renowned games combined,

657
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,320
particularly when a lot of the actual results are not there.

658
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:58,600
In 2017, Yandere said that the simplicity or complexity of the game would be based on the

659
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:03,080
amount of support it received, implying that he was willing to compromise on certain elements.

660
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:07,640
The scope of Yandere Simulator will be determined by the size of its budget.

661
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:13,320
The more money we raise, the more time, work, and features we can put into the game.

662
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,840
But in this video, he clearly implies that it will be complex regardless of the outcome,

663
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,280
and uses it as a shield for the length it has taken to develop the game.

664
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:24,600
Once again, it's a sacrifice of realistic goals for personal sentiments,

665
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:28,520
and the condescending explanation of why everyone should deal with it.

666
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:32,680
On top of the programming argument that Thaf9 has likely debunked in his part,

667
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:37,000
Yandere Dev eventually talks about mental health, a very serious matter.

668
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,200
Yandere Dev- If you push yourself to work as many hours as humanly possible every single day,

669
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,920
then eventually you're going to burn yourself out.

670
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:48,200
You'll become too exhausted and fatigued to be productive.

671
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:53,560
If you work on the same project for multiple years, you'll eventually get tired of it.

672
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:57,320
This will lead to a loss of enthusiasm and motivation,

673
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:01,480
which will cause you to become more easily distracted and less productive.

674
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:08,040
If a group of weird people on the internet decide that they feel completely justified

675
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:13,160
in treating you like garbage, and you're subjected to abusive treatment on a daily basis

676
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:18,120
for multiple years, you'll become depressed, which will affect your productivity,

677
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,240
which will cause people to call you lazy or a scam artist,

678
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,840
which will cause you to receive even more abuse,

679
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:29,160
which will cause you to become even more depressed and less productive,

680
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,600
which becomes a never-ending cycle of abuse and depression.

681
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:37,960
Your fanbase won't know about this for a long time, because you'll do your best,

682
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:38,920
to never speak of it.

683
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:45,320
Eventually, your comment sections will be dominated by people who want to hurl insults at you,

684
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:49,240
and spew ridiculous misinformation that isn't anywhere close to being true.

685
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:54,120
Maybe a handful of people will behave with dignity and respect,

686
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:58,600
but an overwhelming number of people will be cruel and abusive.

687
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:02,520
I have to break this down because mental health in many ways is a subject close to my heart,

688
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:05,080
but at the same time, there are a lot of layers to this.

689
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:07,080
Firstly, let's talk about motivation.

690
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:11,320
We have good days and bad days, I empathise there, but you also have to understand that

691
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:14,520
if people feel that you are not keeping up with these things, particularly if they're

692
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:19,160
supporting you monetarily, they're gonna become impatient, and the problem with Yandere Dev

693
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:23,960
is that he never explained himself in a way that was empathetic to people's concerns.

694
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:29,720
That was his failing all the way back in 2016, and he hadn't amended people's concerns by this

695
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:33,560
point either. How about the unjustified harassment that he had been receiving,

696
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,400
and how that demotivates him?

697
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,880
Now, I would agree to an extent that honestly, there are people out there who are too obsessed

698
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:44,360
with Yandere Dev, and he is quite the target. Nonetheless, as said, to imply it's those

699
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:49,400
experiences that make you demotivated while not being able to take a step back from the internet

700
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:53,720
and seeing the bigger picture is a weakness that has to be partly accountable to you.

701
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:58,280
Asking where these obsessive individuals came from as if you think they just randomly threw

702
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:05,160
a dart and landed on you is dishonest. I feel that a lot of these sentiments built from 2016-2015

703
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:10,440
where they were jumped on by bad actors after a point is another discussion. He acknowledges

704
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:15,240
that this is a small minority who are going after him, and he says that a lot of the people he has

705
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:20,120
interactions with are positive, but never redefines those people from the harsher critics.

706
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:24,840
I'd say it's probable that there were some people looking to stir stuff up, but it's only because

707
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:29,800
sharks smell blood, and when some of Yandere Dev's behaviour and responses started coming to light,

708
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:34,920
they saw a guy who they could bait into lashing out and decimating his own image even further,

709
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:40,040
and Yandere Dev just could never understand that. That's the other issue I take with this,

710
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:44,920
his framing. He acts like he's avoided the drama and negative comments, and acts like it's all flared

711
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:49,240
up out of nowhere. He says he hasn't talked about it, but that's just a lie. There have been times

712
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:53,640
when he's been too far involved, and the only reason more fans probably didn't know is because

713
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:59,240
he does suppress a fair bit of it, and this led me to a new point, but I think social media harmed

714
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:04,200
Yandere Dev and the simulator more than anything. Let's talk about it.

715
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:10,760
YouTube is not the most fun environment a lot of the time. The feedback from people can be pretty

716
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:15,640
negative, pretty depressing, and I completely empathise with how that might affect productivity,

717
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:20,120
but as a game developer, if you're prone to responding badly to negative criticism,

718
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:25,320
maybe a YouTube channel and multiple social media accounts wasn't the best idea. That doesn't

719
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:31,000
justify any harassment, and I want to make that 100% clear, but from a personal perspective,

720
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:36,120
it's clear that Yandere Dev cannot help himself but try and respond, whether that criticism was

721
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:41,000
valid or not, and when he can't respond to it, he'll just try and censor it. The video that we

722
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:46,600
just covered, in spite of its rather significant view count, only has approximately 740 comments,

723
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:51,080
with a distinct lack of critical comments, even polite ones, and you're gonna have a hard job

724
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:56,040
convincing me that no one posted anything remotely nuanced. At one point, it had 72

725
01:02:56,040 --> 01:03:02,200
comments off over 800,000 views. Another place where censorship has been documented was the

726
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:07,720
Reddit for Yandere Simulator, where many had also been critical of it. At the end of 2018,

727
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:12,200
it was alleged that he had bought it, although the exact words in the Discord posts were

728
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:17,640
in exchange for compensation. In the past, Yandere Dev had attempted to quash the claims against him

729
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:22,600
by making a post on the subreddit, admitting he had attempted to buy it, but clearly this was not

730
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:27,080
enough, with many people rebutting him at that point, alongside one now censored comment

731
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:31,400
comprehensively responding and sharing some evidence of their own which shows Yandere Dev in

732
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:36,040
a less than positive light, while proudly stating that they were pleased that the subreddit wasn't

733
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:42,600
bought. However, this did not last. In the end, he purchased it. What was the price? $3,000 for a

734
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:47,880
subreddit. Let that sink in. He had attempted to make his own subreddit too, but it seems that this

735
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:52,920
was not enough due to the volume of people on the other one. Yandere Dev had made it no secret that

736
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:56,920
he was not particularly fond of the Reddit community, in fact, he often doesn't seem

737
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:01,720
particularly fond of many communities, but his post announcing his acquisition was quite dark,

738
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:06,840
telling the story of a person who had manipulated administrations of the subreddit into believing

739
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:12,200
that Yandere Dev was an evil person, and then the harassment just spread like a disease,

740
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:17,480
and it all became too much for him as a person. He writes what other game developers had to deal

741
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:24,200
with this, it's become anxiety inducing to even look at the subreddits. Can you name any other game

742
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:30,440
developer who has had to deal with this nonsense? All these other subreddits are just so lovely,

743
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:36,520
and they don't have any issues. Why does Yandere Dev just receive this unprovoked backlash?

744
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:42,680
Looking at the archives, it's clear there was a lot of drama on his subreddit, and if you want to keep

745
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:47,240
your subreddit away from drama, I'd understand. In August I found posts about how they were going to

746
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:53,320
decrease discussion of Yandere Dev and create a new dedicated Reddit for him. Sounds peachy.

747
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:58,440
However, it seems that a large majority of what Yandere Dev was alleging happened earlier on in the

748
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:04,360
year, and the most popular critical posts, although quite scathing, weren't really harassing, although

749
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:09,480
it's hard to tell exactly, as a large majority of them have been deleted. However, I did manage to

750
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:14,440
dig up some of the censored posts, mostly following his How Long video, and a lot of them are pretty

751
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:19,080
concise, and some are just plain responses. Nonetheless, one trend I did notice was the

752
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:24,040
promotion of a Patreon boycott following that video, and in that month, it seems that Yandere

753
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:29,480
Dev lost over $1,000 in Patreon money, which probably bothered him a lot. There was also a

754
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:34,440
Karma Court case, which is like this court in Reddit. I don't think they have any legal

755
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:39,560
jurisdiction, but it's a thing, and I'm not going to pretend to understand it. You guys do you.

756
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:44,360
To summarise, there was some BS happening, to what extent I'm not sure. His comments weren't the

757
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:48,600
most encouraging. He wasn't really interested in whether the criticism was well-structural,

758
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:53,480
whether it was harassing, regardless of how he frames it. Yes, at the end of the post, he states

759
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:58,840
that any public criticism of him can only be done in bad faith as it means you're trying to stir

760
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:04,520
up drama, and if you have any other criticism of him, you should email him. Now, if you want your

761
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:10,280
subreddit to not be about criticism against you, you're the boss. It's a subreddit, not a democracy,

762
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:14,920
and that's what I always say about these things, but with the context of the criticism that he'd

763
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:19,880
been receiving, to many people this justification once again did not seem concerned about harassment,

764
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:25,160
but more about a desire to control the narrative, rather than focusing on the damn game. I have a

765
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:30,120
hunch that Yandere Dev felt that a lot of the criticism were mostly people pretending to care,

766
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:34,200
and that it was a slippery slope to some of the harassment that he claimed to have been receiving,

767
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:38,760
but for many, that theory just wouldn't cut it. The reason why public criticism exists,

768
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:44,200
even on a personal level, is because Yandere Dev is a person asking for money and support on the

769
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:49,240
basis of trust in his character that he will deliver a game, and if people feel that game

770
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:53,480
isn't going to be delivered, and that people's money would be better invested elsewhere, then

771
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:58,920
they 100% have a right to say that publicly, because that is in the interest of every single

772
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:04,040
person who has invested time or money into your project. Now, once again, although presenting

773
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:09,240
himself as a very busy person, Yandere Dev managed to find time to moderate this subreddit,

774
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:14,360
many of the critical posts disappeared, and in spite of Yandere Dev's claims, he was very involved

775
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:18,840
in the control of what appeared on his reddit, because managing a subreddit is definitely what

776
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:24,040
a person under time constraints to create a video game should be doing. Yandere Dev was very

777
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:29,960
blessed to receive the feedback on his game back in 2014, and I can understand that when faced with

778
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:34,760
this support, he decided to try and use social media to maintain momentum, however, he should

779
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:39,320
have restricted his interactions maximum to YouTube uploads for what he was trying to do.

780
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:43,960
Maybe if he was a bit better at responding to criticism consistently, then he would have been

781
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:48,200
able to engage on other mediums, but there's a reason a large majority of game developers

782
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:54,280
even indie game developers do not rely on public sentiment as buoyancy for a game alone. However,

783
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:59,000
I have a feeling that Yandere Dev was aware, because as we saw a tiny build, he would have

784
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:04,600
trouble without that public support. The fact is that in spite of Yandere's narrative of personal

785
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:10,440
persecution, a majority of YouTube's audiences are a lot less pedantic than industry experts,

786
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:15,160
funnily enough, and that fact was why a lot of the criticism didn't appear until much later

787
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:19,960
when people started looking at it with a more critical eye. If he'd have taken his concept to

788
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:24,520
a larger developer or industry player early on, then he probably would have received some sharp

789
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:29,000
technical criticism that could have averted these issues later on, if he had listened to them, of

790
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,800
course, and in all fairness, in spite of the volume of criticism that he has been subjected to, his

791
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:38,920
videos are still relatively popular, people are still engaging with his content, and the one thing

792
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:44,680
that he hasn't censored, the like to dislike bar, is regularly heavily in his favour. It seems like

793
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:48,680
his tactics had worked in a way, although I feel this would have been less of a big deal if he

794
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:53,160
just hadn't engaged it at all, he was certainly able to prevent the narrative spreading to the

795
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:58,040
core of his support base. I make that statement with a level of reservation, because his Patreon,

796
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:02,600
which is probably a barometer of those closest to the game, shows a bit of lost faith, with its

797
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:07,240
current amount being less than 50% than its peak. It seems that there are a lot more viewers who

798
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:11,960
perhaps find more entertainment value in just watching the videos, rather than directly

799
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:16,920
monetarily supporting development of the game. Although Patreon isn't his only method of income,

800
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:21,400
and he does stream and collect YouTube ad rev, which would be a very impressive amount if all

801
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:24,680
his videos are monetised, although they probably aren't.

802
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:29,800
Yandere Dev So we can attack this lady. Oh my god! Jesus f***ing Christ!

803
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:34,600
In many ways, Yandere Dev managed to shelter a lot of people from the criticism that he had received,

804
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:39,640
and if not, he managed to hold them to one side of the narrative. However, the roots of the problem

805
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:43,800
seemed clear to me, in light of the shortcomings of the development of Yandere Simulator,

806
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:48,840
people began to become restless, and that restlessness has manifested into certain behaviours,

807
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:54,600
some of which are rational, and some of which are irrational, but Yandere Dev's response was often

808
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,000
less than rational. Let's begin to wrap this up.

809
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:06,520
This video has gone into a lot of detail about the failings of Yandere Dev. Now I've laid it out,

810
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:11,560
I hope it's clear to see why certain decisions led him to this ultimatum. It's a classic snowball

811
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:17,400
situation, one where neither the creator nor his critics, and sometimes more obsessive followers,

812
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:22,280
were prepared to yield, so it escalated, and when these situations transpire, one of the

813
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:28,120
inevitabilities is that commentators are going to pick up on it. Now going back to the start of 2018,

814
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:32,360
this was definitely part of the attention that really bothered Yandere Dev. The video that was

815
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:37,240
the harshest was the rise and fall of Yandere Dev, a two hour saga that spent a decent amount

816
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:42,440
of time going through a lot of his worst old posts in crippling detail. It probably did upset Yandere

817
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:47,160
Dev given how he hoped it was behind him, and he probably felt he had responded, and he had

818
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:52,760
to a degree. He wrote a lot of posts on his Tumblr attempting to quote clear up misunderstandings,

819
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:56,920
I think some of his posts do clear up certain issues, but there are also two problems with

820
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:02,280
these responses. Firstly, the structure, it would often involve him quoting without any context,

821
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:06,600
this could allow him to create straw man arguments at will, and obviously reading it,

822
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:11,160
many would argue that he did. The responses were quite general, and thus never gave a sense of

823
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:16,040
closure to a lot of specific situations that occurred. Secondly, the responses weren't easy

824
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:20,680
to find, they were honest Tumblr, but they were spread out, and hard to follow, if you wanted

825
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:25,160
something specific, good luck. By doing this, it gave me the impression that he was typically just

826
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:29,000
appealing to the fans that he already had, who would hear what other people are saying through

827
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,720
Yandere Dev as well, rather than going directly to those sources, and on top of other comments

828
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:38,120
such as the ones made on his Reddit post, I think he often viewed public critics as beyond

829
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:42,840
conversion. Fair enough, but pushing away your critics requires your audience to have some faith

830
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:47,720
in you, and as said, although he has an audience, financial support has taken a hit through

831
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:52,680
organised boycotts, and other creators spreading publicity. His responses often hit the weak point

832
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:57,320
of being too vague to provide himself reasonable defence, but existent enough to draw more attention

833
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:02,600
to them. Other commentators jumping on this didn't help his plight, often looking with a critical eye

834
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:07,800
towards his rash nature. I've also tried not to harp on the content of these old posts too much,

835
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:12,200
but it doesn't help that many of them are pretty unnerving, even though, as I acknowledged they

836
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:16,520
were done a long time ago, at that point his sporadic and even dismissive responses would

837
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:21,560
obviously sour many people. Now, I wanted to spend this final, or nearly final part, please,

838
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:28,040
god let me finish, talking about this, because towards the end of 2018, Yandere Dev continued

839
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:33,320
to reflect on the criticism and hate that he had been receiving, and decided to make an over 20

840
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:38,680
minute video addressing it called Hate and Shame, not the most valuable usage of one's time, but

841
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:41,480
I digress, the video is an interesting one.

842
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:48,840
Yandere Dev Imagine that someone decides to take all of these embarrassing moments from your past, put them into a list,

843
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:55,000
and show that list to his friends. Then, he claims that this list represents you.

844
01:12:55,720 --> 01:13:01,720
His friends believe him, and develop a twisted mental image of you. They perceive you as a

845
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:08,120
caricature of who you really are, with all of your flaws greatly exaggerated. Unfortunately for you,

846
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:14,440
their hobby is ridiculing and shaming people, and they've decided that you would be a fun target.

847
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:20,760
And so, they start stalking you. They follow you everywhere you go, taking pictures of you,

848
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:25,720
recording videos of you, and digging through your trash to look for anything embarrassing

849
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:30,600
you might have thrown away. Sometimes they even try to directly provoke you,

850
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:35,000
because they think it's funny if they get a reaction out of you. If you're an artist,

851
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,160
they'll claim that you're bad at painting. If you're a chef, they'll claim that you're bad at

852
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:43,080
cooking. And if you're a programmer, they'll claim that you're bad at writing code.

853
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:47,480
I assume this is meant to be an analogy, although it's hard to tell. The hate and shame video is

854
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:52,360
basically 22 minutes of Yandere Dev talking from this disconnected perspective about his own

855
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:57,720
personal experience. His purpose is to try and make people empathise with him, and maybe give

856
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:02,680
him some advice. I was gonna say that his video shows a failure to distinguish between the online

857
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:06,680
and real world, but then he goes to talk about the real world harassment that he alleges to

858
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:12,040
have received. After enough people have been convinced that you're an awful, terrible person

859
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:18,120
who deserves to be ridiculed and scorned, you will begin to receive harassment, prank calls,

860
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:23,000
weird things being mailed to your house, getting spammed with pictures of animal abuse and

861
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:30,360
bestiality, being stalked in real life. The video made me feel two things, sad and manipulated.

862
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:35,400
It's a depressing video, and this could be how Yandere Dev interprets the situation,

863
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:40,520
he has this status that would obviously not make elements of the internet enjoyable,

864
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:45,560
and there is a lot of personal stuff out there, but I also find it very manipulative, the use of

865
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:51,000
generalisations, vagueness, and purely anecdotal content, it personally rubs me the wrong way,

866
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,800
and I get that the internet can be a pretty toxic place, it sucks that there are always people out

867
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:59,480
there a little to obsess with you, and with something like Yandere Simulator and the sort

868
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:04,520
of cult-like status it acquired, it's very easy for one of those avid fans to become sour and then

869
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:08,680
be on an all-out crusade to get you, probably bolstered by some real sicker fans on the more

870
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:12,440
menacing side of the internet, and that will probably spill into your real life,

871
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:18,440
so I'm not saying for certain that this didn't happen, but my god, you don't feed the trolls,

872
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:24,200
Yandere Dev was practically providing them with an all-you-can-eat buffet. In a later post,

873
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:29,880
he stated that his video on emails actually led to an increase in emails, so I don't know why

874
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:35,400
he thought a video on this topic would lead to any sort of de-escalation. These videos also had a

875
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:40,120
tendency to spray fire at their targets, although in a later post Yandere Dev would claim that his

876
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:44,680
video is mostly directed towards these trolls and harassers, in the video he draws a clear link

877
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:49,560
between the people who have criticised him as those who are also responsible for the harassment,

878
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:54,520
implying that they are the people who then go out and do that harassment, although as mentioned,

879
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:59,000
it's likely these were quite different parties due to the altering motivations and goals that

880
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:03,800
would come with it. On top of this, parts of his video seem to encompass points even more general,

881
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:09,080
attacking YouTubers who have spoken about him using video titles to reference creators like

882
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:13,400
KappaKaiju and Thaf9 while calling out their approach to making their videos.

883
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:20,120
Channels that are dedicated to ridiculing and shaming other people. These YouTubers make money

884
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:26,360
by degrading, debasing and defaming others. Eventually, these YouTubers will hear what

885
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:30,760
the gremlins are saying about you, and then they will start making videos about you.

886
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:37,880
It doesn't benefit them to portray you with accuracy and honesty, it benefits them to

887
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:43,720
exaggerate your flaws and depict you as a cartoonish caricature of who you really are,

888
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:50,760
because that would be more entertaining and will result in more clicks and views, maximizing their

889
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:56,840
ad revenue. If they really were interested in telling the truth, then they would contact you

890
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:03,080
directly and ask you for your side of the story. However, none of them will ever do this.

891
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:07,320
I think ultimately the problem with this video and the problem with all of this drama is that

892
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:13,240
he skips a key part of responding to drama, and it's ultimately why he ended up in this mess,

893
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:20,200
and that is evidence. I know people like KappaKaiju and Thaf9, they may not be gods or gurus,

894
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:24,760
they may not be the all-seeing eye, I'm not either, but they don't go out with the intention

895
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:30,440
of crucifying people, they go with what they're given, and at that point they had very little

896
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:35,160
from Yandere Dev. You can't just say, oh, if they really want something, they should email me.

897
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:39,480
If you're not prepared to put something out there publicly, why should they trust you in private

898
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:44,280
with it? I've trusted people in private before, and it has cost me. If you don't have anything

899
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:50,920
publicly revolutionary to say to the drama, don't say anything at all. Yandere Dev always wanted to

900
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:57,640
talk about it, but never had anything to actually say, and fortunately, his audience recognised that,

901
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:03,240
because at the end of his hate and shame video, he conducted a poll, asking whether he should make

902
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:09,000
more videos regarding this issue, oh god, or whether he should leave it behind and focus on

903
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:14,920
the game. People voted pretty conclusively for the latter, the game. I think that's something of

904
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:20,200
importance to note regarding this video, it is once more an appeal to his already existent audience

905
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:25,160
on what he should do about this drama. If you don't like Yandere Dev, you're not gonna like this

906
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:31,960
video, and boy, a fair few people did not. There were a load more criticisms about him deleting

907
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:37,960
comments, including this video which shows them being removed in live time. Once again, even mild

908
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:41,800
ones, there was a person who claimed to be the original artist for the video who had their own

909
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:48,840
comments to make about the Dev's behaviour. Ironically, yet unsurprisingly, this video about drama

910
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:53,560
caused more drama. I'm not going to rule out the idea that Yandere Dev may have experienced some

911
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:58,280
legitimate harassment at the hands of trolls, and he has regularly cited this as the reason for why

912
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:03,000
he has behaved in a rather erratic and even toxic way himself. Nonetheless, I feel that this can

913
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:08,120
only be used as a defence up to a point, because his short-tempered demeanour was existent prior

914
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:13,640
to the escalation of the drama that he argued to be engaged in, and his behaviour has extended

915
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:19,160
beyond the erratic and emotional into the calculated. It just reaches a point where you

916
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:25,000
line all the drama up, and it becomes hard to say that these incidents are as isolated as he claims

917
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:30,200
them to be. I don't doubt that Yandere Dev probably had many positive interactions with his audience,

918
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:35,160
and I'm not going to argue against that point, but even in context with Yandere Dev's greater

919
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:39,960
character, the negative interactions held a significant frequency and relevance to the

920
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:45,320
discussion at hand. A lot of the video was once again focusing on what he was experiencing,

921
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:49,960
rather than a natural response to the points against him, and maybe we would have received

922
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:54,680
a more concise response if people had voted for it, but I don't know how he would respond

923
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:58,520
to the various criticisms that escalated throughout the year, such as the volunteers

924
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:02,600
who claimed he wasn't treating them well enough, the discord users who claimed he just spontaneously

925
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:07,240
banned them for no discernible reason, the people he flipped out at over email, or whatever other

926
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:11,800
communicative mediums. Since then, he has reiterated the idea that the harassment was

927
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:16,520
what caused him to behave in such a way. If he believes the harassment placed him in a negative

928
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:20,840
state of mind that predisposed him to behave in such a way, then what else would he have

929
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:25,480
had to say in additional videos? I think for the benefit of him, his audience, and for anyone

930
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:32,120
involved, it was best left there. So what has happened since then? Well, the only real point

931
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:37,000
of interest in this is what is known as the debunk page, which provides running updates

932
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:41,880
to criticism that he's been receiving. It's certainly more nuanced than his previous responses,

933
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:46,040
and one thing I did appreciate was that he seems to recognise those who are frustrated with the

934
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:51,560
game's development in a nuanced way, though I'm not sure how he treats that attitude publicly,

935
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:56,120
and I do feel that such an approach is prone to miscategorisation, and I'd stress that it's always

936
01:20:56,120 --> 01:21:01,240
best to side on the benefit of the doubt when dealing with certain criticisms. As you, the viewer,

937
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:05,560
you're more than at liberty to check out these responses, as they're probably the most composed

938
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:09,960
Yandere dev has been, although I would stress that many have taken issue with them still,

939
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:15,000
and made videos of their own. I find the response page rather defensive, and although definitely

940
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,960
a bit more refreshing, it's not a significant deviation from his old narratives that I would

941
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:25,800
still personally take issue with. The point is, when dealing with drama, if you don't have anything

942
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:29,720
that's going to turn perspectives on its head, particularly when your content is being well

943
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:35,320
received otherwise, it's not sensible to make videos obsessing over the situation. In a discord

944
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:41,000
post he said that everything after this was going to worsen, first a 20% dislike bar, then a 30%

945
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:49,240
dislike bar, then 50%, 100%, 1000%, everything was going to fall apart and the game would be cancelled

946
01:21:49,240 --> 01:22:00,760
and no one would support him anymore. But wait, it didn't. Why not? Let's end this.

947
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:24,680
Yandere Dev acted like he was on the verge of losing everything, yet even at its lowest,

948
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:30,200
his videos were backed up by a strong, dedicated audience. There are only two ways that losing

949
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:35,800
momentum of his size could happen. Firstly, if someone makes a well written, devastating,

950
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:41,480
exposed video or post and completely turn public perception on its head, or if people in general

951
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:46,920
become disillusioned or bored as a whole and stop supporting. The first one didn't really happen,

952
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,720
the only well organised videos were fairly mild mannered, and others were just not well produced

953
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:56,600
enough. So maybe it's the second, but that didn't really happen either, there were disillusioned

954
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:02,200
people, but not that many of them, and even fewer who were actually taking part in any of the stuff

955
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:06,760
that he accused people of. People who want to spread criticism of your game or hurt your image,

956
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:11,000
probably aren't going to be the same as people who want to harass you because that would compromise

957
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,960
their own point. Providing that happened, that was likely mostly trolls who latched onto the

958
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:20,840
disillusion as an excuse to cause havoc. A lot of attention on the drama was generated

959
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:26,600
by Yandere Dev himself, and although the minority was quite vocal at points, its reach was limited

960
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:32,440
to certain domains, only being boosted when Yandere Dev would respond himself. Let's be clear,

961
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:38,360
the people who said shut up and focus on the game were doing Yandere Dev a massive service,

962
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:39,800
and he should have listened sooner.

963
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:52,520
For a bit, it did tail off, but it flared up again at the start of 2020, with what seemed to be more

964
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:57,720
completely unnecessary drama. Yandere Dev placed his Discord server in a position where you pay to

965
01:23:57,720 --> 01:24:02,040
message due to an alleged number of raids, and although it's his server, once again, it seems

966
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:06,360
like a bad thing to be managing himself. Someone tweeted out an interaction where they messaged

967
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:10,520
him suggesting technical changes that could prevent raids, while also maintaining activity,

968
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:14,520
which of course there are multiple. You turn off link embeds, turn off images, slow mode, strong

969
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:19,000
moderation team, IP banning, blacklisted words, and I hate this discussion, because eventually

970
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:24,200
when this guy clearly presents a load of solutions and rebuts Yandere Dev's comments, Yandere Dev

971
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:29,800
just turns around and says, actually, you don't get it. No, my friend, you don't get it, and I wonder

972
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:33,800
if you'll ever get it, if there are technical solutions to a problem you can't appeal to some

973
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:38,680
greater level of understanding which doesn't exist. Some people might get past one or two

974
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:42,920
blocks, but Discord has a load of settings and bots that can be used to prevent such activity

975
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:48,360
without using a paywall, which is what it is, no semantics. He did open up again, thankfully,

976
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:53,160
but Jesus Christ, this drama has turned the Discord into a bit of a punchline, with people

977
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:58,440
speedrunning it. People see this stuff as funny, Yandere Dev doesn't, takes it very seriously,

978
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:03,880
and then people meme it more. It's a cycle. In a now deleted tweet made in January 2020,

979
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:08,360
Yandere Dev also loses to taking his own life due to this harassment, and without sounding like Tyler

980
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:13,320
the Creator, and with all respect, the fact that online work can be extremely stressful, he needs

981
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:17,960
to take a step back from the internet and stop engaging in it to the degree he does. Add this to

982
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:21,880
the claim that he's making less than minimum wage right now, which, although I personally find to be

983
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:26,360
doubtful given his revenue stream, if true, I have to wonder what his motivations even are for

984
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:31,400
continuing at this stage. There are so many posts of him involving himself with drama, DMing people,

985
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:36,360
long messages, interviews, some petty arguments. I don't know if he thinks he needs to have this

986
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:41,560
interaction to maintain interest in the game, maybe he's won people over in the DMs, he probably has,

987
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:46,840
but so many times it just gets published and shows him as someone with an inability to communicate

988
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:52,520
with basic criticism in spite of him proclaiming his proficiency. It's like Yandere Dev has this

989
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:57,400
almost parasitic relationship with the internet, he sees it as the only way of maintaining the

990
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:01,800
development of his game, and yet he has so much drama and conflict, he thinks he's attaching

991
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:06,680
himself out of necessity rather than desire, and this leads to completely destructive behaviour

992
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:11,400
which he feels he has to suffer through, but by proxy of that makes him a victim. On the other

993
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:16,600
hand, Yandere Dev's critics view this victimhood as being exploited at every opportunity in an

994
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:21,800
attempt to blanket harassment with legitimate criticism and Yandere Dev's continuous failure

995
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:26,360
to deliver a finished product which for many should have been delivered a long time ago. If

996
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:31,080
you're a fan, then you may well sympathise with him, but few would disagree that a lot of this

997
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:37,160
has been avoidable, and people have still been contacting me about it. I wonder if it's because

998
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:42,440
people want my verdict on the actual progress of the game. It's hard to say, Yandere Dev now posts

999
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:47,480
update reports, but they don't show anything too radical, people are still waiting on the character

1000
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:52,600
Osana, he seems more focused on other developments before moving on to that, and it's obvious the

1001
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:58,120
video game is not going to be completed by the end of 2019. Given his commitments, that will likely

1002
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:03,320
disappoint people. By the time many of you are watching this, it'll probably be 2020. Development

1003
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:07,640
still seems relatively slow, there are probably people impatient with the progress, but Yandere

1004
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:12,040
Dev at least has probably learned not to make promises he can't keep. There's no sign of the

1005
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:16,040
crowdfunding project yet, so I guess we'll see how that will be received in due time.

1006
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:22,040
The video game itself seems like an exhausting venture, given Yandere Dev's desire to retain a

1007
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:27,000
lot of control, he clearly feels a commitment to finish it. He doesn't want to give up control

1008
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:32,520
given his investment, it's the sunk cost fallacy. He has sunk an investment in, and he isn't willing

1009
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:37,960
to give it up, or compromise easily on a creative vision in the hope that he will get there, and he

1010
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:43,640
might get there. At the same time, continuing this will undoubtedly be a draining endeavour, and I

1011
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:48,520
think it's a justified concern to posit whether the game will ever be finished given the scale

1012
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:53,400
and ambition. I'm not here to fully write anything off, and I don't think it's a bad thing to follow

1013
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:57,000
if you're just interested in watching the development, which I think is where a lot of

1014
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:02,040
his current audience stands, but I'd advise caution in investing. With the current trajectory, it's a

1015
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:07,720
risk you'd have to accept. The whole situation became weird to follow for me, because on the

1016
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:12,200
one hand, Yandere Dev seemed to acknowledge that the people who may be rather extreme in their

1017
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:17,160
behaviour towards him were part of a small minority, and yet he dedicated so much time and

1018
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:21,880
attention to them, often causing a strident on the issue. He said that he was okay with criticism if

1019
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:26,200
it was delivered in a constructive way, but constantly censored public criticism regardless

1020
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:30,840
of tone, implying that he perceived even well-delivered criticism in bad faith. He acts

1021
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:36,360
like he wants to be out of the drama, but keeps involving himself in it. He constantly said things

1022
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:41,080
were taken out of context, but never really provided the context that would help his case out.

1023
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:45,000
I know it's a wild bat, but the example that still sticks out to me was the one regarding

1024
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:50,200
that clearly disgruntled fan who was annoyed about his mod. After going after him, Yandere Dev

1025
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:54,920
said he doesn't regret it on the corresponding Reddit post. In his debunked post, he said he

1026
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:59,640
often felt remorseful, but I don't think many people ever saw that, they just saw someone who

1027
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:05,640
was belligerent and arrogant. In reality, I think Yandere Dev was just so incredibly

1028
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:11,160
fragile over his public status that after the hostility backfired, he just went all out to

1029
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:16,040
suppress criticism. He's stubborn, and a bit paranoid, and I don't think that's been to his

1030
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:21,160
favour, often ending up in conflicts with people in his own audience. As the hype slowed down,

1031
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:25,800
and the Patreons dropped out, he became more frantic. Although the more public nature of

1032
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:30,360
Yandere Dev's involvement with drama has subsided, the censorship has not. There are a load of these

1033
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:35,960
situations, but probably my favourite was a post criticizing Corona-Chan being removed, with a

1034
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:40,360
person suggesting in the replies that they should just look to this other post for a more constructed

1035
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:44,840
way to communicate this criticism, but that post has been removed as well. It seems rather

1036
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:48,840
authoritarian, with the Dev and his admins becoming more and more obsessed with tracking

1037
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:53,720
members' movements, including their participation in other servers and subreddits to read their

1038
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:58,760
intentions. It feels a bit like a cult, to be honest, and I'm not gonna leave many warnings in

1039
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:02,920
this video, because enough information is out there for people to make informed decisions,

1040
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:07,800
but this sort of behaviour is gonna create a bubble which is bound to burst, and it's a really

1041
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:14,040
bad idea. But why is this bubble being created in such a way? My hunch is that Yandere Dev had

1042
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:18,760
troll distinguishing between fans legitimately frustrated about the development of the game,

1043
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:24,440
and those he would class as concerned troll. People pretending to care about the game's best

1044
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:28,840
interests but having slightly more negative intent. He felt that he was being targeted,

1045
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:33,480
and he probably knew that well worded yet more biting criticism would do more damage than

1046
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:37,960
anything else, so he tried to lump those people in with the harassers. The problem is that Yandere

1047
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:42,440
Dev often went for false positives rather than false negatives, which led him to lashing out and

1048
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:48,200
censoring people who may have genuinely cared about the progress of the game. 2015 and 2016

1049
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:53,960
definitely saw controversy coming from his own attitude, 2017 saw the exposure of certain

1050
01:30:53,960 --> 01:31:00,120
technical failings, and 2018 saw an escalation in the arguments, frustration, and angst both

1051
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:05,160
sides had, amounting in an eventual burnout of the drama when the fans simply told him that enough

1052
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:12,760
was enough. Now in 2020, I guess we'll see how it all progresses. Do I think he's a bad person?

1053
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:17,720
I don't know, but I do feel his arguments regarding the progress of the game and his abilities were

1054
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:22,200
pretty poor. I also think his time management was exceptionally bad, I'm not sure if he knew

1055
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:26,360
they were, or he genuinely believed that the game's complexity justified the amount of time

1056
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:30,760
he had taken on it, but if he'd spent half the time arguing that he was working on the game,

1057
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:35,480
well, working on the game, he'd probably get a lot more done. You have to accept that there will

1058
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:40,920
be people who will go out of their way to hate you. Does it make it right? No. Does it mean you

1059
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:47,000
should become equally invested in it? Also no, I'd also say that a lot of people had completely

1060
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:51,480
valid quarrels with him, and although his intent may not have been outwardly malicious, it doesn't

1061
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:56,040
undermine the grief caused by belligerence, rancor, or any other behaviours that can be

1062
01:31:56,040 --> 01:32:00,600
attributed to this curious character. I'd say it's probable that there were some people looking

1063
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:05,320
to stir stuff up, but it's only because sharks smell blood, and when some of Yandere Dev's

1064
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:10,200
behaviour and responses started coming to light, they saw a guy who they could bait into lashing

1065
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:15,800
out and decimating his own image even further, and Yandere Dev just could never understand that.

1066
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:20,920
You've probably forgotten when addressing his what's taking so long video, I said there was

1067
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:25,000
one other option that we'd get back to. Well, let's talk about it. Actually,

1068
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:31,160
I'll let Yandere Dev talk about it. Presently, Yandere Simulator is my full-time job.

1069
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:38,360
I get paid to work on it. As long as I'm getting paid to work on it, I feel obligated to pour every

1070
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:44,360
second of my life into it. As long as I'm getting paid for my time, it's perfectly fair for people

1071
01:32:44,360 --> 01:32:54,040
to complain if I don't make timely progress on the game. But, what if I wasn't getting paid to

1072
01:32:54,040 --> 01:33:04,040
work on it? What if I closed my Patreon completely, then I could downgrade Yandere Sim from a full-time

1073
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:12,440
job to just a hobby? I would have no obligation to work on it for any longer than I feel like working

1074
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:20,840
on it. I would have no reason to give it any more attention than I feel like giving it. I would

1075
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:30,600
finally be able to play video games and watch anime again. Nobody could call me lazy anymore.

1076
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:41,720
All of my problems would be solved. But, all of my fans would hate me. Someone else would

1077
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:49,720
develop a Yandere-themed game to take the place of my game. I would fade from memory, and all of the

1078
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:57,640
work I've done over the past three years would be for nothing. It's tempting to downgrade Yandere

1079
01:33:57,640 --> 01:34:06,920
Simulator to just being a hobby so that I can take my life back, but it would probably be a one-way

1080
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:13,560
street with no turning back. Now, aside from the fact that he's playing Beethoven again, dude really

1081
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:19,320
likes Beethoven, it may be too late now, but in 2017, this was the best option in my opinion, this

1082
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:24,520
was the option that if I was a fan, I would have voted for. It's his choice, but if he's as

1083
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:29,880
pressured as it appears, passing it on wasn't a bad idea. I think the main concern is that it's a

1084
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:34,680
decision that he would not be able to revert, maybe he wants to prove people wrong by finishing the

1085
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:39,560
game, but back then, I think a quarter of his audience understood. I tell him that he shouldn't

1086
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:44,200
listen to polls alone, but he went with the option that only 5% of the audience voted for, so I can't

1087
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:49,080
really say he did. Yandere Dev sees the source of his life in this community, that's the thing,

1088
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:54,280
there's more to this world than a community. I get there's a concern that you fade from memory,

1089
01:34:54,280 --> 01:35:00,600
I get it too, but this is no way to be remembered. Yandere Dev and his game Yandere Simulator is the

1090
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:06,200
perfect example of a social media-propelled video game when everything goes wrong. The obsession

1091
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:11,240
with hype over practicality, the motivation to keep it online, the lack of expert consultation,

1092
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:17,480
the lucky developer who was ill-prepared, and his volatile involvement with a passionate audience.

1093
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:22,440
It led to criticism which then snowballed, and led everyone to lose out, and without his fanbase

1094
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:27,000
just telling him to stop, it probably would have gone in the direction that he said it was going to.

1095
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,880
This current route seems to be less destructive, and I am grateful for that, but I wonder if he's

1096
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:36,120
really learned from his mistakes, or if he just learned to hide the glaring flaws a bit better.

1097
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:43,080
Only time will tell. For now, he should be grateful that he has a relatively committed and open-minded

1098
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:48,600
audience. In spite of all the antics, he's still doing okay, and if I were him, I wouldn't take that

1099
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:53,880
for granted. For any other creators slash wannabe game developers, take this as a cautionary tale.

1100
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:57,720
Regardless of who you think is right or wrong, there's a lot that can be learned.

1101
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:03,320
Don't let usual drama cost you your life passion, it's not worth it, and don't think that everyone

1102
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:07,960
is out to get you, even if it may hurt. I hope the game is worth it.

1103
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:15,320
First things first, make sure you go and check out Thaf9, he does great video essays on games,

1104
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:20,440
I love his work, he's got a great energy about him, and he's such a lovely guy too, I can root for that

1105
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:24,920
big time, so definitely go and send him some love, because he's done a great job here,

1106
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:29,160
you know, I can't thank him enough for coming in and filling in a gap that would've taken me a lot

1107
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:35,160
of reading to get to grips with, so thank you on that front. So yes, that was the video, I would

1108
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:40,760
like you to check out all the editors below, they're once again done a fantastic job, and

1109
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:45,640

to my patreons, $10 plus patreons are on the screen right now, and I need to give a special

1111
