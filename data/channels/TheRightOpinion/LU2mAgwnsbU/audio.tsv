0	26060	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of A2AT with too
26060	28020	much free time.
28020	29020	Why are we here?
29040	32260	Not this video of course, though you may be asking that question as well, to be honest
32260	36500	I ask that question on a fairly regular basis, but on this grand earth, when you think too
36500	40380	much about it, like I have on many nights, it almost seems incredible that out of all
40380	45300	the odds, we are here, existing, at the same time we are rational beings who like to make
45300	49220	sense of phenomena, and questions that seem beyond our understanding, however one of the
49220	53300	most challenging questions that has ever faced mankind is why are we here?
53300	57740	Ask people, and you will receive a surprising variety of answers, for the nihilist who believes
57740	60900	that we're just here to f**king die, to the astrologist who believes the stars have
60900	62140	all aligned in our favour.
62140	66620	One of the most common explanations for why we're here is the notion of a higher celestial
66620	68220	being, or a god.
68220	72900	For many people, it makes sense, either through philosophical explanation or personal experience.
72900	77060	The notion of a god can be very beneficial for many people, however it's not just an
77060	81380	individual opinion, although everyone of course has their own perception, typically an individual's
81380	85620	belief in a higher celestial power will be made sense through the lens of religion.
85620	89380	Religion allows people to categorise their core perceptions a bit more clearly, and often
89380	94020	provide elaboration as to what sort of behaviours may be desirable from the perspective of a
94020	95020	god.
95020	99140	This is typically content that will reach into our daily life, our diet, our relationships,
99140	100140	our behaviour.
100140	104300	How we define ourselves is very important, and having religion as a moral foundation
104300	108980	for behaviour gives people much more clarity in what they believe, and in spite of its
108980	112460	flaws, it does help many people define themselves.
112460	116360	Many people who may be lacking purpose will find it in religion, and many may develop
116360	120940	a keen enthusiasm for it, and will want people to see that they have seen it.
120940	124460	They will want to spread the word, they will become missionaries of sorts.
124460	127780	Now back in the days of old, missionaries travelled all over the world to spread the
127780	131660	word of religion, and do their best to convert individuals who may be otherwise sceptical
131660	132980	of what they preach.
132980	135180	Some people still do that to this day.
135180	138420	And speaking of nuts, I have a nut here, okay?
138420	140100	And this is a bolt, okay?
140100	142980	So listen, this is what a normal person does, alright?
142980	145660	See I got the bolt right here, represent the male, right?
145660	148340	We got the nut right here, represent the female, alright?
148340	150660	This is what normal people do, okay?
150660	161580	This is what, now let me show you what insanity says to do.
161580	165820	With mixed results, but others have felt the need to modernise the medium of how they spread
165820	168220	their knowledge, and this has led us to YouTube.
168220	172900	YouTube is the medium for influence, there are so many people who use YouTube for multiple
172900	177020	purposes from all over the world, and you don't have to leave your room to post content
177020	180040	there, it truly is revolutionary for communication.
180040	183660	YouTube's user base is also pretty young, and given that young people are least likely
183660	187940	to belong to religion, this leads to a target audience that is primed for conversion to
187940	190240	whatever religion they choose.
190240	194760	Now at first it seemed that most religious content uploaded was just broadcasts of preachers
194760	198040	providing their religious wisdom to their congregation.
198040	201960	Because of the cultural variety within these preachers, this definitely led to some unique
201960	207880	insight into what happens in certain churches.
208780	225540	It
225540	229220	is quite wondrous to be honest, but that's why we're here today, because eventually many
229220	234260	creators popped up whose content wasn't just a broadcast, but an actual direct creation,
234260	238400	with the purpose of talking directly to you, the viewer, to tell you about the joys of
238400	242020	religion, and as mentioned there are many religions, but the one we will be focusing
242020	247100	on today is one that I assume you guys are a bit more familiar with, Christianity.
247100	250980	Christianity has been one of the culturally dominant religions in the western world over
250980	255280	observable history, for better and for worse, and because of its cultural dominance, it
255280	259680	feels natural that it would be one of the most commonly represented on a fairly westernised
259680	264080	platform, though mind you, looking at T-Series, the internet is certainly expanding.
264080	268000	For now, I assume most of the people who watch my channel are typically exposed to
268000	273000	the same brand of religious creator that I am, and that brings us to Girl Defined.
273000	277520	Girl Defined, or Girl Defined Ministries if you're feeling extra godly, is the Christian
277520	280260	channel owned by sisters Bethany and Kristen.
280260	285500	They are what I would brand as internet missionaries, providing a modern update to the age old messages
285500	287120	preached in the bible.
287120	291200	Now they've been going for a good five years, and over that time they have put out a consistent
291200	295340	stream of content which, although varying in their delivery, is still focusing on the
295340	300240	core message, that we should act in the way that God has intended us to, and avoid sinful
300240	301240	behaviour.
301240	304540	They also have their own website where they publish various thoughts, they're selling
304540	308760	their own books, and they're even going on tour apparently, so they must really have
308760	309760	a following.
309760	313360	This seems fairly unexceptional to an extent, there are plenty of people who do this, and
313360	317240	arguably there are many people who do it in a much more provocative fashion.
317280	321720	In fact, on first glance, two white bread girls talking about how to behave in a Christian
321720	325080	way seems like one of the most regular concepts for a channel.
325080	329440	However, over the years, and in particular since around 2018, they have been the centre
329440	333900	of attention for multiple YouTubers, who have made videos mocking or critiquing their content
333900	336140	and the narratives that they promote through this.
336140	341120	One video by prominent YouTuber comedian Cody Ko, in which he reacts to various Girl Defined
341120	343660	videos, has over 12 million views on it.
343700	348100	That means 12 million people decide to tune in to watch someone react to this.
348100	352820	My guy obsession didn't happen all at once, it was a slow, gradual process to where it
352820	356380	was the first thought, then the second thought, then making an effort to be near him, then
356380	360380	doing this, until eventually it became the most important thing in my life.
360380	362940	I mean, it's not quite endgame, is it?
362940	367460	Nonetheless, since then, it's been collateral for creators to pile and to clown on these
367460	368460	lasses.
368460	372380	It is a savage, never-ending cycle with more dunking than a Michael Jordan game.
372380	377420	Girl Defined have become one of the few creators, alongside the likes of Amblin, Reed and Onision,
377420	381060	where videos about them typically pull more views than their own videos.
381060	384740	However, unlike these two, the reason is quite a different one, I believe.
384740	386420	So what did they do?
386420	388980	Well, that's what we're here to find out today.
388980	393680	Yes, ladies and gentlemen, today my goal will be to analyse Girl Defined's content, work
393680	398520	out their appeal, try to understand them in the cultural landscape, attempt to apprehend
398520	403480	why they seem to occupy such a unique niche, and try to understand what the appeal is to
403480	406360	comedians, commentators, and bullies alike.
406360	411160	Jake Paul knows, to ascertain exactly how Girl Defined became one of YouTube's biggest
411160	412160	targets.
412160	425140	I suggest we get right in there.
425140	429420	The first video up on Girl Defined's channel is a video in which they decide to ask various
429420	434700	students of what appears to be a university campus of what a quote girl really is.
434700	438180	The point that they were trying to prove through this video was that in the modern day, many
438180	441780	people do not understand what really defines a girl.
441780	446820	They're about to suggest that they are God-defined girls in a culture-defined world.
446820	451660	God has the key to understanding what womanhood really is, and once you understand it too,
451660	453480	you can be as complete as them.
453480	457040	And as girls go, they seem pretty defined.
457040	461160	I guess this video was to essentially set the premise of the sort of identity crisis
461160	463900	that many of our younger generations appear to face.
463900	467600	It's clear in the interviews that many people can't really answer the questions that Bethany
467600	469880	and Kristen put forth so confidently.
469880	473400	They clearly perceive this as a pressing issue that they want resolved.
473400	478240	They are defined girls, not like these formless blobs out there, and they are here to spread
478240	479880	that definition to you.
479880	481440	So how are they going to do that?
481880	484320	Well first, let's begin to work out solutions.
484320	487860	You have to discern the source of this identity crisis that we perceive.
487860	492760	This is central to a lot of Girl Defines videos, but for research purposes, I decide to watch
492760	493760	them from the start.
493760	495640	And the strangest thing happened.
495640	497160	I started to agree with them.
497160	499680	When people wanted me, I felt like I was worth something.
499680	503640	When they didn't, I felt like my worth went down, and that is one of the biggest lies
503640	504640	in the industry.
504640	505640	That's true.
505640	509560	Another thing I noticed is that behind the scenes, all those happy smiling faces, all
509560	513600	these perfect lives that we see on TV and on the posters, really aren't there.
513600	516680	So many of the girls I knew were really insecure.
516680	520240	They were struggling with basing their worth and their identity on their looks as well.
520240	524360	And in fact, we've read a quote from a famous supermodel who actually said that in the modeling
524360	528960	industry, the famous models that she knew were some of the most insecure women.
528960	532240	So the truth is, what we see on the posters, what we see on the magazines, what we see
532240	535720	on the TV, isn't actually the true definition of womanhood.
535720	537240	Yeah, I'm not going to deny that.
537240	538240	It looks good.
538240	539240	It smiles.
539240	542040	It looks pretty, but it's actually counterfeit.
542040	546200	For example, self-worth in the beauty industry is a very real problem, and the fact that
546200	550600	there was almost an anecdotal opening made it a lot more accessible, made the problem
550600	552760	seem a lot more resonant as well.
552760	555080	As a side note, I read their writing prompts.
555080	556080	Pretty good stuff.
556080	558520	I might have to write a cheeky article for them one day.
558520	563880	After three of our book Girl Defined, we actually dive into what we call three pillars of counterfeit
563880	564880	femininity.
564880	565880	Oh, cheeky plug.
565880	567880	So anyhow, what is their solution?
567920	571360	Hey guys, it's Kristen and Bethany here with Girl Defined Ministries, and this is video
571360	575080	number two in our series, Four Secrets to Brave and Bold Womanhood.
575080	578560	Video number two was called The Power of Embracing God-Defined Womanhood.
578560	579560	Oh, right.
579560	580560	Yeah, I forgot.
580560	581560	It's a channel about God.
581560	585040	The second truth that we came across is that Christ defines our worth.
585040	588960	As women, just like we shared in the last video, we are always searching for, okay,
588960	589960	what gives me worth?
589960	590960	What gives me value?
590960	591960	What gives me identity?
591960	595760	And the verse that we discovered that has given us a lot of hope is Psalm 139, 13 through
595760	596760	14.
596760	597760	You may know it.
597920	599060	You created it for God.
599060	600560	You created my immoral parents.
600560	602480	You knitted me together in my mother's womb.
602480	606080	I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
606080	610080	I mean, here you have these girls who are arguably outlined a very reverent problem
610080	613600	within our society, and their solution is gods.
613600	617560	On the surface, it doesn't really make much sense, but what they're actually trying to
617560	620700	say, well, I think this one quote's quite interesting.
620700	624080	We live in a culture like we talked about in the last video that is totally obsessed
624080	625440	with outward appearances.
625440	630240	So we have our culture that portrays models and beautiful women as the ideal woman, but
630240	634420	God's version of a successful and beautiful woman is actually totally opposite, totally
634420	636520	countercultural to what we see out in the world.
636520	640360	Proverbs 31, 30 says, and you probably know this first, that charm is deceptive and beauty
640360	644400	is fleeting, but a woman who fears the Lord, she is to be praised.
644400	648260	And basically all that verse is saying is that it's not as important what's on the outside.
648260	650540	The outward appearance is not the main thing.
650540	651540	It's fleeting.
651540	652540	Yeah, exactly.
652540	653540	It's going to go away.
653540	655500	Inside is what really matters.
655500	659860	God's saying a woman who fears the Lord, a woman who looks to my word and strives to
659860	662680	honor me and live according to my standards.
662680	666720	That is the woman that should be praised, not the woman who has the outward beauty.
666720	671260	Here I think they outline why religion is so meaningful to them, because in society,
671260	674780	many people are fearful that their worth will be defined by the judgment of others.
674780	679280	But basically, girl-defying creates almost a logical tautology in a way, by making the
679280	681780	statement that only Christ can define their worth.
681780	686020	They are handing over a level of security to the viewer to view themselves in the eyes
686020	687020	of Christ.
687020	691900	Now the thing is, in their eyes, Christ or God is presented as the divine being, and
691900	696560	in this instance, well, all forgiving, and therefore it takes the responsibility of judgment
696560	701540	away from society and those around you, and places it into the conception of a person
701540	706420	who will judge you how you believe they will judge you, rather than being the subject to
706420	711700	direct judgment that could obviously be problematic, because no one can judge as perfectly as
711700	712700	God.
712700	713700	He is our creator.
713700	715120	He is the one who gives us worth.
715120	718900	No one else can give us our worth, because he didn't create us, we have no authority
718900	719900	to give us our worth.
719900	723820	Christ gives us our worth, and understanding that truth has given us a lot of hope.
723820	727700	Establishing the premise of God seems to be the basis of their content, which is also
727700	730660	why they're so confident in the rhetoric they espouse.
730660	736060	They see God as diametrically opposed to culture, and thus present the argument of his existence
736060	739340	as the solution to the societal ills that they perceive.
739340	743980	The issue is that other skeptics and atheists will reject the assertion that God exists,
743980	748460	and this then creates a disparity of discourse when people who are not accepting of the concept
748460	750620	of God encounter their content.
750620	755060	What happens is that in some videos, Girl Defined explicitly present the notion of God
755060	756940	existing as a premise.
756940	761420	However in others, they mostly mention it in passing, which makes their cultural commentary
761420	763700	the perfect balance for people to react to.
763700	788300	Digestible, yet kind of bizarre.
788300	791660	The problem is, ultimately many of us view religion as culture.
791660	795780	Even if we are religious, we will likely accept that our perception is our perception.
795780	800380	In the instance of Girl Defined, the rejection of religion as culture means that they often
800380	805100	make arguments from the position of Christianity as truth, not as perception.
805100	809260	Therefore this often leads to arguments being made from the position of certainty rather
809260	810800	than conditionality.
810800	815940	Now arguing that God exists is not inherently bad, but there is such a conviction to a lot
815940	820580	of Girl Defined's social statements that so many people will find so inherently grey
820580	825100	about how we should behave, and how you can define things like identity.
825100	830020	Therefore Girl Defined's rhetoric often comes across as self-satisfied and conceited, and
830020	834180	people love the feeling that they're talking back to a self-asserted authority.
834180	838980	Now make no mistake, it's important that people do feel confident in their identity, but Girl
838980	844800	Defined reduced the number of identities possible or acceptable down to a few very basic ideas
844800	849060	of what in this instance a girl should be, and this leads to statements that when you
849060	853200	remove the ideas of their basic philosophy become very easy to mock.
853200	857660	But you see, I've only really explained why their logic becomes somewhat funny, a logic
857660	860020	that, in all fairness, many people have.
860020	864220	There are many more details which make Girl Defined a little different to the rest of
864220	875820	the bunch.
875820	880100	Now we've presented and assessed the underlying mindset of Girl Defined, and how that one
880100	884300	principle would cause issues, we need to look at how they have really come to stand out
884300	885300	from the crowd.
885300	887680	Let's start with their presentation.
887680	892380	Presentation is key to any creator who wants a long-term career on YouTube, and Girl Defined
892380	893700	definitely have that.
893700	898180	As said, generally presentation is clear and legible, the aesthetic is nice and clean,
898180	902300	and their videos have a clear structure, they are done in a way that would be quite regular
902300	903300	for a YouTuber.
903300	908400	However, the problem is, as shown by other videos, that whole environment is very saccharine,
908400	912160	and they use such a repetitive structure, it becomes very forced.
912160	916860	Go back a few years, and there was that brand of ukulele music that everyone abhors now,
916860	918140	and justifiably so.
918140	922500	To describe it, if stock ukulele tracks were a Christian YouTube channel, they'd be Girl
922500	932020	Defined.
932020	936140	Many people have picked up on this, and have commented on how in a way the content seems
936140	937420	catered to children.
937420	941500	Now in my opinion, they're not actually trying to sell the content to children, they're selling
941500	945200	what they believe is the ideal image of pure femininity.
945200	950300	This is how they idealise womanhood, that sort of virginal purity, and for some reason
950300	956180	a big proportion of internet comedy is cynically deconstructing that of which appears pure.
956180	960700	Maybe it's just because of the contrast in tones, but Girl Defined's general tone tends
960700	973620	to come across as lacking some self-awareness.
973620	977380	And that's the thing, after watching enough of their videos, I wouldn't say they lack
977380	980980	awareness, I'd say it's their agenda.
980980	985440	Actually sounds worse to be honest, but given their ideas of purity, it is completely in
985440	987780	line with how they present the content.
987780	1013340	This is the sort of stuff that they are repulsed by for example.
1013340	1018320	It's easy to goof on because of the assumptions they make in this lovely wholesome environment.
1018320	1022840	What is normal to many people is terrible to them, and their horror at the thought that
1022840	1027040	plagues into comedic potential because when we think of terrible things we don't think
1027040	1028040	of porn.
1028040	1032500	They are extremely sensitive, and that is entertaining because it seems bizarre even
1032500	1035480	if it makes complete sense to them because of their religion.
1035480	1039580	As mentioned, if you want to guest post on their website, they drop clear and concise
1039580	1041200	guidelines on how to.
1041200	1045160	Unsurprisingly, these guest guidelines reflect how they present their videos.
1045160	1050120	They really like telling stories, and on one hand, this makes their content easier to digest.
1050120	1053200	They're not just throwing a barrage of bible quotes at you.
1053200	1057200	However, because the stories are actually quite interesting, it's easier to provide
1057200	1062100	good comedic material out of them, particularly in how they use them often to justify various
1062100	1065680	doctrines that seem a bit separated from the stories they tell.
1065680	1069700	It's the same reason that comedians love to tell stories, different material in this
1069700	1070700	instance.
1070700	1074780	Most of the videos on them present them as these people who are so deeply indoctrinated
1074780	1078780	with what they believe, and I think that's the great contrast that arguably provides
1078780	1080180	the best content.
1080180	1084280	They hold such deeply conservative views in many aspects, yet present them in such an
1084280	1088200	innocent and pure way, despite it making absolute sense.
1088200	1091980	For example, you wouldn't see Cody Ko make a video on the Westboro Baptist Church because
1091980	1094580	in many ways they're extremely aggressive and unlikable.
1094580	1098920	However, when the same sorts of views are presented like a cute bunny with a bow tie,
1098920	1099920	it's fair game.
1099920	1103040	Now, God defined are not the Westboro Baptist Church.
1103040	1105020	No, the point is aesthetics.
1105020	1109280	These play into the contrast of the message, and how easy it is to make content on it.
1109280	1114240	As culture changes, as time changes, the definition changes too, so how in the world do we know
1114240	1117420	what is true, what is right, when it comes to marriage?
1117420	1122120	We as Christians can look in God's word and see from the beginning, like we talked about,
1122120	1125700	God's constant truth, God's good plan for marriage.
1125700	1127720	So yeah, cultural progress, not allowed.
1127720	1133080	Gotta do it like we did it 2,000 years ago, guys.
1133080	1137080	This contrast can be witnessed in other videos that have received a bitter attention, such
1137080	1139680	as this Christian girl's mourning routine.
1139680	1144280	And that is so powerful, because the moment I step outside of my bedroom door, I'm going
1144280	1148880	to be attacked with lies upon lies upon lies from the enemy, because we live in a world
1148880	1151080	that is ruled by the father of lies.
1151080	1157920	So it is crucial, and it is essential that I get my armour of God on, and I fill my heart
1157920	1159400	with his truth.
1159400	1163280	Now from what I've understood is that this girl is actually autistic, and absolutely
1163280	1164280	lovely.
1164280	1167640	Equally, she's not really someone who uploads content on a regular basis, or who's tried
1167640	1170860	to actually create a brand, which is what Girl Defined have done.
1170860	1173600	These points all represent something greater.
1173600	1178320	Cultural accessibility, which is the real final nail in the coffin about how these girls
1178320	1180680	become such easy targets.
1180680	1185040	There are plenty of people who make fundamentalist statements, but most of them exist within
1185040	1188860	environments that we do not fully understand, therefore we're hesitant to go after them
1188860	1193280	because we don't want to be seen as punching down to a different culture in different contexts.
1193280	1197240	With white-bred Christian girls in a seemingly privileged scenario, it seems that there's
1197240	1199160	basically nothing to punch down to.
1199160	1202600	In many ways, they are perceived to represent the religious establishment.
1202600	1206960	Equally, this is what makes their statements so amusing at some points, the seeming perception
1206960	1208880	that they are fighting the culture.
1208880	1212080	So why do all these responses get so many views?
1212080	1216700	Well, it seems that the reason that responses to Girl Defined's content is so popular
1216700	1221380	is because the ideas they propose are so isolated from how people perceive them that people
1221380	1225480	just can't get enough of videos telling them why they're wrong, or just taking the
1225480	1226480	mick.
1226480	1229560	They're kinda funny, kinda awkward, it's not the sort of content that most people want
1229560	1230560	to watch unironically.
1230560	1235220	But once you see someone reacting or responding, it adds so much more value.
1235220	1237920	The people just love to see anything about them.
1237960	1240880	It is the pinnacle of transformative content.
1240880	1243240	Girl Defined aren't really that controversial.
1243240	1247180	Their views are a bit iffy for me, obviously, gay marriage and all that, but having dodgy
1247180	1251960	takes because you're extremely religious is not the same as Onision or Amberlynn who
1251960	1254160	are just beyond saving in many ways.
1254160	1255840	These girls seem pretty safe.
1255840	1258120	Was it worth it to save sex for marriage?
1258120	1259120	What do y'all think?
1259120	1261120	I mean, absolutely.
1261120	1265240	And when these little factors came together, what really set them off was the classic domino
1265240	1266240	effect.
1266240	1270240	It became clear that the videos on this topic were well performing, plenty of people wanted
1270240	1271600	in on the clownery.
1271600	1275160	Because there's no real risk in covering them for whatever audience you have.
1275160	1279280	No one's really gonna come out in their droves to defend these two girls who, as nice and
1279280	1284940	innocent as they seem, similarly love to present ideas that to many people are absolutely ridiculous,
1284940	1287680	whether people genuinely think they deserve it or not.
1287680	1291800	People can't really find a way to defend them because they neither say anything particularly
1291800	1295240	insightful nor do they seem particularly aggrieved in any way.
1295240	1298600	And that's generally what we look for when we try to defend people.
1298600	1300400	Is this the logic we should be using?
1300400	1310840	Well, let's discuss it a bit further.
1310840	1315260	The ultimate irony of what makes their content so easy to mock is that they promote such
1315260	1320720	pure sanitary behaviour which is given the green light through YouTube on the basis of
1320720	1322120	social norms.
1322120	1326240	Many of which have carried through from older social norms, the ones that often seem to
1326240	1331900	present as radical and out there, unlike the regularly demonetised LGBT content which is
1331900	1334560	presented by YouTubers so mainstream.
1334560	1339160	It makes it easy to mock without the threat of demonetisation or restriction while simultaneously
1339160	1341680	dealing out interesting cultural points of view.
1341680	1345440	Girl Defined don't appear to monetise their videos, but it's quite clear that most of
1345440	1349520	it would be fairly advertiser friendly, I mean, they arguably promote more conservative
1349520	1352760	views than people who've been banned off Patreon and they're on Patreon.
1352760	1356840	I don't mind, I think a lot more content should be fair game for monetisation, but
1356840	1361000	it equally shows the weird cultural double standards that we may still adhere to.
1361000	1364760	Through all of this, they ultimately become one of the easiest targets on YouTube, not
1364760	1366960	just for comedy, but also for commentary.
1366960	1371960	They're accessible, presentable, easy to watch, and in many ways the contrast between
1371960	1376800	their very mainstream attitude to their sudden mentioning of God creates this sort of dystopian
1376800	1381440	image of these friendly, happy girls talking to you about what God wants you to do.
1381440	1403600	With the right music, I'm sure we can make that into something much more intense.
1403600	1409000	The point is, it can be equally comedic and unsettling, giving it a lot of creative potential
1409000	1413520	for multiple creators, but do they really deserve it, or are they just under attack
1413520	1416360	from a culture that just can't include them anymore?
1416360	1418800	Are they really fighting their fight?
1418800	1423400	The thing is that, in a way, given the direction of general human culture right now in the
1423400	1427560	western world, particularly that which is represented on YouTube, waiting to kiss before
1427560	1430400	marriage could certainly be seen as different.
1430400	1434440	I mean, it's certainly not something that a majority of us do nowadays, but they seem
1434440	1439320	to be confusing things we're not doing as things we're told we shouldn't be doing.
1439320	1442800	This is where the general counter-cultural argument comes into play.
1442800	1445240	So, not the thing anymore.
1445240	1450640	Teen girls and young women are no longer taught in mainstream to save sex for marriage.
1450640	1456440	We're taught now to have safe sex, to be safe and cautious in the way we go about it, but
1456440	1462320	purity truly has become a thing of the past, and we are told by our culture that having
1462320	1465720	sex before marriage, that's a good thing, go for it, just be safe about it.
1465720	1469720	But that is a lie, and something we need to recognise as Christian girls, that that is
1469720	1473200	not God's best for us, that is not his perfect plan.
1473200	1475960	Having sex before marriage is not a good thing.
1475960	1480660	The reason that certain behaviours were considered, quote, punk back in the day was not because
1480660	1485760	most people didn't do it, it was because society specifically told them that it's something
1485760	1487000	they shouldn't do.
1487000	1492200	So doing all these dirty, grimy activities was a defiant cry against society.
1492200	1496560	No society, as we currently know it, is going to condemn you for waiting until marriage
1496560	1497560	to kiss.
1497560	1501120	If a person's friend told them that they were going to do that, I'm sure most people would
1501120	1506840	say something along the lines of, okay, nice, and carry on with their day.
1506840	1511820	Not exactly the same reaction as telling someone you were gay 40 years ago, or even today in
1511820	1513080	some scenarios.
1513080	1515520	Girl Defined are not radical.
1515520	1518780	They may be different, but they're existing without persecution.
1518780	1523040	But all right, if you went into a Girl Defined comment section, you could very easily say
1523040	1526520	there is a bias against them speaking about these things.
1526520	1530760	However, the whole idea of countercultural movements was that people shouldn't be telling
1530760	1535360	others how to live, something that Girl Defined is basing their brand on.
1535360	1540260	So it's debatable if on concept they can ever really frame their presentation of religion
1540260	1541760	as countercultural.
1541760	1545960	Now we all have moral discussions about what should be done, it's a core element to our
1545960	1546960	platform.
1546960	1548960	We can't all be miserable nihilists.
1548960	1554080	But if I was to assert a moral position, I would also be completely opening myself up
1554080	1559440	to criticism on that perspective too, especially if others did not feel it was moral either.
1559440	1564000	Do I believe that Girl Defined should receive stick for talking about that sort of lifestyle?
1564000	1565360	Well, it depends.
1565360	1569720	On principle, these things are a person's choice, and if that choice is more conservative,
1569720	1570720	then that is fine.
1570720	1574340	And if they want to talk about how it's helped them, then it would seem mean-spirited to
1574340	1575720	take them down for that.
1575720	1580000	At the same time, the core philosophy that they promote is also one that is restrictive,
1580000	1584800	and not one that is a solution for everyone, and based on ideas that many people justifiably
1584800	1587520	don't agree with, and have called out.
1587520	1591180	Interestingly enough, many of the critical comments that I saw people referring to was
1591180	1595640	the potential harm this sort of philosophy could do to children, and in many ways I do
1595640	1597020	completely see that.
1597020	1601660	The rigidity of certain concepts is extremely hard on people who inherently don't fit
1601660	1606740	into those molds, especially at a time when religion was very invested in the system,
1606740	1611380	and that whole discourse should in a way be a discussion primarily for adults, and yet
1611380	1615700	weirdly enough their content could very easily be seen as some of the most child-friendly
1615700	1617980	content on YouTube at some points.
1617980	1621540	That's because although we've modernised many points of view to be inclusive, we've
1621540	1625860	also held onto some fairly traditional principles, for better and for worse.
1625860	1630060	To get me wrong, sexual self-control is not a bad thing, as we've seen over the last
1630060	1631060	few years.
1631060	1634780	I mean, I never have sex, and it's definitely not because I'm alone and sad, I promise
1634780	1639460	it's just because I have restraints, but when it leads into topics that probably should
1639460	1643860	be talked about with a bit more ease, many people tend to get uptight about it, large
1643860	1645060	corporations included.
1645060	1649420	At the start of this video, I spoke about missionaries, and how they have constantly
1649420	1653020	existed and called Girl Defined internet missionaries.
1653020	1656900	After watching enough videos by Girl Defined, given how they often don't really try and
1656900	1660980	justify God, I wouldn't say they're very traditional in their style.
1660980	1665900	A lot of their content just comes across as catered primarily for Christians, even though
1665900	1668660	they've said they want to reach out to other people.
1668660	1672540	Proverbs 31 30 says, and you probably know this first, that charm is deceptive and beauty
1672540	1676540	is fleeting, but a woman who fears the Lord, she is to be praised.
1676540	1681020	However, because their content exists on a platform that can be accessed by anyone, and
1681020	1685500	because they often try and talk about content from a social perspective, it can reach many
1685500	1690300	people, it can be understood by many people, and it can be argued by many people, and for
1690300	1692900	what it's worth, it is great arguing material.
1692900	1697420	On surface value, the shock of the more basic points of view are great for comedy, and below
1697420	1700860	the surface, their justifications for it are great for discussion.
1700860	1705740	What they provide is still a relatively mainstream view in some communities, therefore people
1705740	1710460	have no discomfort criticising it, yet on YouTube, because of the politics of the YouTube
1710460	1715660	base tending to be rather anti-sex police, left wing or right wing, people also feel
1715660	1720660	enjoyment of them being responded to without feeling that they're unfairly going after
1720660	1723580	people, despite the fact that they're clearly outnumbered.
1723580	1727660	Given the views are not completely off the table and do have moral implications, it is
1727660	1755620	kinda justified if people want to respond.
1755620	1759900	If you believe in God, it's fair enough, I'm not going to tell you what and what not
1759900	1764820	to believe, but there is something so fascinating about the people so convinced of the belief
1764820	1770460	they believe that you can dictate many people's behaviours, and it will just free their mind,
1770460	1773100	even if they're seemingly rather inconsequential.
1773100	1778580	The idea of a normal YouTuber who is also extremely Christian is embodied by the content
1778580	1783500	of Girl Defined, which is what ultimately makes them so open to the ridicule and rebuttal
1783500	1787780	that they often receive, we should all do our best to define ourselves, however it
1787780	1792580	is inevitable that many people will not find that definition in religion, and this is something
1792580	1795660	that Girl Defined don't seem to quite grasp.
1795660	1800520	Although it's clear they've defined themselves, Girl Defined's content and responses to
1800520	1805440	it may be overdone, but their ideas and videos are the sort of stuff we loved seeing people
1805440	1810260	clap back to, and they've marked it in a way that makes it perfect for just that.
1810260	1815220	So credit where credit's due, and hey, they even get free promotion, the Lord does indeed
1815220	1819620	work in mysterious ways.
1819620	1824100	So yeah, that's the video, I hope you guys enjoyed it, it felt good recording this one,
1824100	1828960	it felt nice, it felt good fun, it's good when you have a good feeling recording something
