00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,060
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of A2AT with too

2
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,020
much free time.

3
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,020
Why are we here?

4
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,260
Not this video of course, though you may be asking that question as well, to be honest

5
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:36,500
I ask that question on a fairly regular basis, but on this grand earth, when you think too

6
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,380
much about it, like I have on many nights, it almost seems incredible that out of all

7
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,300
the odds, we are here, existing, at the same time we are rational beings who like to make

8
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,220
sense of phenomena, and questions that seem beyond our understanding, however one of the

9
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,300
most challenging questions that has ever faced mankind is why are we here?

10
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,740
Ask people, and you will receive a surprising variety of answers, for the nihilist who believes

11
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,900
that we're just here to f**king die, to the astrologist who believes the stars have

12
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,140
all aligned in our favour.

13
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,620
One of the most common explanations for why we're here is the notion of a higher celestial

14
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,220
being, or a god.

15
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,900
For many people, it makes sense, either through philosophical explanation or personal experience.

16
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,060
The notion of a god can be very beneficial for many people, however it's not just an

17
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,380
individual opinion, although everyone of course has their own perception, typically an individual's

18
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,620
belief in a higher celestial power will be made sense through the lens of religion.

19
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,380
Religion allows people to categorise their core perceptions a bit more clearly, and often

20
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:34,020
provide elaboration as to what sort of behaviours may be desirable from the perspective of a

21
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,020
god.

22
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:39,140
This is typically content that will reach into our daily life, our diet, our relationships,

23
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,140
our behaviour.

24
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,300
How we define ourselves is very important, and having religion as a moral foundation

25
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,980
for behaviour gives people much more clarity in what they believe, and in spite of its

26
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,460
flaws, it does help many people define themselves.

27
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,360
Many people who may be lacking purpose will find it in religion, and many may develop

28
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,940
a keen enthusiasm for it, and will want people to see that they have seen it.

29
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,460
They will want to spread the word, they will become missionaries of sorts.

30
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,780
Now back in the days of old, missionaries travelled all over the world to spread the

31
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,660
word of religion, and do their best to convert individuals who may be otherwise sceptical

32
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,980
of what they preach.

33
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,180
Some people still do that to this day.

34
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,420
And speaking of nuts, I have a nut here, okay?

35
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,100
And this is a bolt, okay?

36
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,980
So listen, this is what a normal person does, alright?

37
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,660
See I got the bolt right here, represent the male, right?

38
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,340
We got the nut right here, represent the female, alright?

39
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,660
This is what normal people do, okay?

40
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:41,580
This is what, now let me show you what insanity says to do.

41
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,820
With mixed results, but others have felt the need to modernise the medium of how they spread

42
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,220
their knowledge, and this has led us to YouTube.

43
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,900
YouTube is the medium for influence, there are so many people who use YouTube for multiple

44
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,020
purposes from all over the world, and you don't have to leave your room to post content

45
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,040
there, it truly is revolutionary for communication.

46
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,660
YouTube's user base is also pretty young, and given that young people are least likely

47
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,940
to belong to religion, this leads to a target audience that is primed for conversion to

48
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,240
whatever religion they choose.

49
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,760
Now at first it seemed that most religious content uploaded was just broadcasts of preachers

50
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,040
providing their religious wisdom to their congregation.

51
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,960
Because of the cultural variety within these preachers, this definitely led to some unique

52
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:27,880
insight into what happens in certain churches.

53
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:45,540
It

54
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,220
is quite wondrous to be honest, but that's why we're here today, because eventually many

55
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:54,260
creators popped up whose content wasn't just a broadcast, but an actual direct creation,

56
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,400
with the purpose of talking directly to you, the viewer, to tell you about the joys of

57
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,020
religion, and as mentioned there are many religions, but the one we will be focusing

58
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:07,100
on today is one that I assume you guys are a bit more familiar with, Christianity.

59
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,980
Christianity has been one of the culturally dominant religions in the western world over

60
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,280
observable history, for better and for worse, and because of its cultural dominance, it

61
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,680
feels natural that it would be one of the most commonly represented on a fairly westernised

62
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,080
platform, though mind you, looking at T-Series, the internet is certainly expanding.

63
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,000
For now, I assume most of the people who watch my channel are typically exposed to

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
the same brand of religious creator that I am, and that brings us to Girl Defined.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,520
Girl Defined, or Girl Defined Ministries if you're feeling extra godly, is the Christian

66
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,260
channel owned by sisters Bethany and Kristen.

67
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,500
They are what I would brand as internet missionaries, providing a modern update to the age old messages

68
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,120
preached in the bible.

69
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,200
Now they've been going for a good five years, and over that time they have put out a consistent

70
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,340
stream of content which, although varying in their delivery, is still focusing on the

71
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,240
core message, that we should act in the way that God has intended us to, and avoid sinful

72
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,240
behaviour.

73
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,540
They also have their own website where they publish various thoughts, they're selling

74
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,760
their own books, and they're even going on tour apparently, so they must really have

75
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,760
a following.

76
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,360
This seems fairly unexceptional to an extent, there are plenty of people who do this, and

77
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,240
arguably there are many people who do it in a much more provocative fashion.

78
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,720
In fact, on first glance, two white bread girls talking about how to behave in a Christian

79
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,080
way seems like one of the most regular concepts for a channel.

80
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,440
However, over the years, and in particular since around 2018, they have been the centre

81
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,900
of attention for multiple YouTubers, who have made videos mocking or critiquing their content

82
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,140
and the narratives that they promote through this.

83
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:41,120
One video by prominent YouTuber comedian Cody Ko, in which he reacts to various Girl Defined

84
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,660
videos, has over 12 million views on it.

85
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,100
That means 12 million people decide to tune in to watch someone react to this.

86
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,820
My guy obsession didn't happen all at once, it was a slow, gradual process to where it

87
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,380
was the first thought, then the second thought, then making an effort to be near him, then

88
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,380
doing this, until eventually it became the most important thing in my life.

89
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,940
I mean, it's not quite endgame, is it?

90
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,460
Nonetheless, since then, it's been collateral for creators to pile and to clown on these

91
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,460
lasses.

92
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,380
It is a savage, never-ending cycle with more dunking than a Michael Jordan game.

93
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,420
Girl Defined have become one of the few creators, alongside the likes of Amblin, Reed and Onision,

94
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,060
where videos about them typically pull more views than their own videos.

95
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,740
However, unlike these two, the reason is quite a different one, I believe.

96
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,420
So what did they do?

97
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,980
Well, that's what we're here to find out today.

98
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,680
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, today my goal will be to analyse Girl Defined's content, work

99
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,520
out their appeal, try to understand them in the cultural landscape, attempt to apprehend

100
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,480
why they seem to occupy such a unique niche, and try to understand what the appeal is to

101
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,360
comedians, commentators, and bullies alike.

102
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,160
Jake Paul knows, to ascertain exactly how Girl Defined became one of YouTube's biggest

103
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
targets.

104
00:06:52,160 --> 00:07:05,140
I suggest we get right in there.

105
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,420
The first video up on Girl Defined's channel is a video in which they decide to ask various

106
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:14,700
students of what appears to be a university campus of what a quote girl really is.

107
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,180
The point that they were trying to prove through this video was that in the modern day, many

108
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,780
people do not understand what really defines a girl.

109
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,820
They're about to suggest that they are God-defined girls in a culture-defined world.

110
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:31,660
God has the key to understanding what womanhood really is, and once you understand it too,

111
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,480
you can be as complete as them.

112
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,040
And as girls go, they seem pretty defined.

113
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,160
I guess this video was to essentially set the premise of the sort of identity crisis

114
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,900
that many of our younger generations appear to face.

115
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,600
It's clear in the interviews that many people can't really answer the questions that Bethany

116
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,880
and Kristen put forth so confidently.

117
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,400
They clearly perceive this as a pressing issue that they want resolved.

118
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,240
They are defined girls, not like these formless blobs out there, and they are here to spread

119
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,880
that definition to you.

120
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,440
So how are they going to do that?

121
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,320
Well first, let's begin to work out solutions.

122
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,860
You have to discern the source of this identity crisis that we perceive.

123
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,760
This is central to a lot of Girl Defines videos, but for research purposes, I decide to watch

124
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,760
them from the start.

125
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,640
And the strangest thing happened.

126
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,160
I started to agree with them.

127
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,680
When people wanted me, I felt like I was worth something.

128
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,640
When they didn't, I felt like my worth went down, and that is one of the biggest lies

129
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
in the industry.

130
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,640
That's true.

131
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,560
Another thing I noticed is that behind the scenes, all those happy smiling faces, all

132
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,600
these perfect lives that we see on TV and on the posters, really aren't there.

133
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,680
So many of the girls I knew were really insecure.

134
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,240
They were struggling with basing their worth and their identity on their looks as well.

135
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,360
And in fact, we've read a quote from a famous supermodel who actually said that in the modeling

136
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,960
industry, the famous models that she knew were some of the most insecure women.

137
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,240
So the truth is, what we see on the posters, what we see on the magazines, what we see

138
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,720
on the TV, isn't actually the true definition of womanhood.

139
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,240
Yeah, I'm not going to deny that.

140
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,240
It looks good.

141
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,240
It smiles.

142
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,040
It looks pretty, but it's actually counterfeit.

143
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,200
For example, self-worth in the beauty industry is a very real problem, and the fact that

144
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,600
there was almost an anecdotal opening made it a lot more accessible, made the problem

145
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,760
seem a lot more resonant as well.

146
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,080
As a side note, I read their writing prompts.

147
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
Pretty good stuff.

148
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,520
I might have to write a cheeky article for them one day.

149
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,880
After three of our book Girl Defined, we actually dive into what we call three pillars of counterfeit

150
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,880
femininity.

151
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
Oh, cheeky plug.

152
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,880
So anyhow, what is their solution?

153
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,360
Hey guys, it's Kristen and Bethany here with Girl Defined Ministries, and this is video

154
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,080
number two in our series, Four Secrets to Brave and Bold Womanhood.

155
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,560
Video number two was called The Power of Embracing God-Defined Womanhood.

156
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560
Oh, right.

157
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,560
Yeah, I forgot.

158
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,560
It's a channel about God.

159
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,040
The second truth that we came across is that Christ defines our worth.

160
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,960
As women, just like we shared in the last video, we are always searching for, okay,

161
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,960
what gives me worth?

162
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
What gives me value?

163
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
What gives me identity?

164
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,760
And the verse that we discovered that has given us a lot of hope is Psalm 139, 13 through

165
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,760
14.

166
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
You may know it.

167
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,060
You created it for God.

168
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,560
You created my immoral parents.

169
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,480
You knitted me together in my mother's womb.

170
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,080
I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

171
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,080
I mean, here you have these girls who are arguably outlined a very reverent problem

172
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,600
within our society, and their solution is gods.

173
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,560
On the surface, it doesn't really make much sense, but what they're actually trying to

174
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,700
say, well, I think this one quote's quite interesting.

175
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,080
We live in a culture like we talked about in the last video that is totally obsessed

176
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,440
with outward appearances.

177
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,240
So we have our culture that portrays models and beautiful women as the ideal woman, but

178
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,420
God's version of a successful and beautiful woman is actually totally opposite, totally

179
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,520
countercultural to what we see out in the world.

180
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,360
Proverbs 31, 30 says, and you probably know this first, that charm is deceptive and beauty

181
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,400
is fleeting, but a woman who fears the Lord, she is to be praised.

182
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,260
And basically all that verse is saying is that it's not as important what's on the outside.

183
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,540
The outward appearance is not the main thing.

184
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,540
It's fleeting.

185
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,540
Yeah, exactly.

186
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,540
It's going to go away.

187
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,500
Inside is what really matters.

188
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,860
God's saying a woman who fears the Lord, a woman who looks to my word and strives to

189
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,680
honor me and live according to my standards.

190
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,720
That is the woman that should be praised, not the woman who has the outward beauty.

191
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,260
Here I think they outline why religion is so meaningful to them, because in society,

192
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,780
many people are fearful that their worth will be defined by the judgment of others.

193
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:19,280
But basically, girl-defying creates almost a logical tautology in a way, by making the

194
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,780
statement that only Christ can define their worth.

195
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:26,020
They are handing over a level of security to the viewer to view themselves in the eyes

196
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,020
of Christ.

197
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,900
Now the thing is, in their eyes, Christ or God is presented as the divine being, and

198
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,560
in this instance, well, all forgiving, and therefore it takes the responsibility of judgment

199
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,540
away from society and those around you, and places it into the conception of a person

200
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:46,420
who will judge you how you believe they will judge you, rather than being the subject to

201
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:51,700
direct judgment that could obviously be problematic, because no one can judge as perfectly as

202
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,700
God.

203
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,700
He is our creator.

204
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,120
He is the one who gives us worth.

205
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,900
No one else can give us our worth, because he didn't create us, we have no authority

206
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,900
to give us our worth.

207
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,820
Christ gives us our worth, and understanding that truth has given us a lot of hope.

208
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,700
Establishing the premise of God seems to be the basis of their content, which is also

209
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,660
why they're so confident in the rhetoric they espouse.

210
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:16,060
They see God as diametrically opposed to culture, and thus present the argument of his existence

211
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,340
as the solution to the societal ills that they perceive.

212
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,980
The issue is that other skeptics and atheists will reject the assertion that God exists,

213
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,460
and this then creates a disparity of discourse when people who are not accepting of the concept

214
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,620
of God encounter their content.

215
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:35,060
What happens is that in some videos, Girl Defined explicitly present the notion of God

216
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,940
existing as a premise.

217
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,420
However in others, they mostly mention it in passing, which makes their cultural commentary

218
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,700
the perfect balance for people to react to.

219
00:12:43,700 --> 00:13:08,300
Digestible, yet kind of bizarre.

220
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,660
The problem is, ultimately many of us view religion as culture.

221
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,780
Even if we are religious, we will likely accept that our perception is our perception.

222
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:20,380
In the instance of Girl Defined, the rejection of religion as culture means that they often

223
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,100
make arguments from the position of Christianity as truth, not as perception.

224
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,260
Therefore this often leads to arguments being made from the position of certainty rather

225
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,800
than conditionality.

226
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,940
Now arguing that God exists is not inherently bad, but there is such a conviction to a lot

227
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,580
of Girl Defined's social statements that so many people will find so inherently grey

228
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:45,100
about how we should behave, and how you can define things like identity.

229
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:50,020
Therefore Girl Defined's rhetoric often comes across as self-satisfied and conceited, and

230
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,180
people love the feeling that they're talking back to a self-asserted authority.

231
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,980
Now make no mistake, it's important that people do feel confident in their identity, but Girl

232
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,800
Defined reduced the number of identities possible or acceptable down to a few very basic ideas

233
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,060
of what in this instance a girl should be, and this leads to statements that when you

234
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:13,200
remove the ideas of their basic philosophy become very easy to mock.

235
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,660
But you see, I've only really explained why their logic becomes somewhat funny, a logic

236
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,020
that, in all fairness, many people have.

237
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:24,220
There are many more details which make Girl Defined a little different to the rest of

238
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:35,820
the bunch.

239
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:40,100
Now we've presented and assessed the underlying mindset of Girl Defined, and how that one

240
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,300
principle would cause issues, we need to look at how they have really come to stand out

241
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,300
from the crowd.

242
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,680
Let's start with their presentation.

243
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,380
Presentation is key to any creator who wants a long-term career on YouTube, and Girl Defined

244
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,700
definitely have that.

245
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,180
As said, generally presentation is clear and legible, the aesthetic is nice and clean,

246
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,300
and their videos have a clear structure, they are done in a way that would be quite regular

247
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,300
for a YouTuber.

248
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:08,400
However, the problem is, as shown by other videos, that whole environment is very saccharine,

249
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,160
and they use such a repetitive structure, it becomes very forced.

250
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,860
Go back a few years, and there was that brand of ukulele music that everyone abhors now,

251
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,140
and justifiably so.

252
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,500
To describe it, if stock ukulele tracks were a Christian YouTube channel, they'd be Girl

253
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:32,020
Defined.

254
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:36,140
Many people have picked up on this, and have commented on how in a way the content seems

255
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,420
catered to children.

256
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,500
Now in my opinion, they're not actually trying to sell the content to children, they're selling

257
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,200
what they believe is the ideal image of pure femininity.

258
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,300
This is how they idealise womanhood, that sort of virginal purity, and for some reason

259
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:56,180
a big proportion of internet comedy is cynically deconstructing that of which appears pure.

260
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,700
Maybe it's just because of the contrast in tones, but Girl Defined's general tone tends

261
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:13,620
to come across as lacking some self-awareness.

262
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,380
And that's the thing, after watching enough of their videos, I wouldn't say they lack

263
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,980
awareness, I'd say it's their agenda.

264
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,440
Actually sounds worse to be honest, but given their ideas of purity, it is completely in

265
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,780
line with how they present the content.

266
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:53,340
This is the sort of stuff that they are repulsed by for example.

267
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:58,320
It's easy to goof on because of the assumptions they make in this lovely wholesome environment.

268
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,840
What is normal to many people is terrible to them, and their horror at the thought that

269
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,040
plagues into comedic potential because when we think of terrible things we don't think

270
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,040
of porn.

271
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,500
They are extremely sensitive, and that is entertaining because it seems bizarre even

272
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,480
if it makes complete sense to them because of their religion.

273
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,580
As mentioned, if you want to guest post on their website, they drop clear and concise

274
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,200
guidelines on how to.

275
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,160
Unsurprisingly, these guest guidelines reflect how they present their videos.

276
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:30,120
They really like telling stories, and on one hand, this makes their content easier to digest.

277
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,200
They're not just throwing a barrage of bible quotes at you.

278
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,200
However, because the stories are actually quite interesting, it's easier to provide

279
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,100
good comedic material out of them, particularly in how they use them often to justify various

280
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,680
doctrines that seem a bit separated from the stories they tell.

281
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,700
It's the same reason that comedians love to tell stories, different material in this

282
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,700
instance.

283
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,780
Most of the videos on them present them as these people who are so deeply indoctrinated

284
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,780
with what they believe, and I think that's the great contrast that arguably provides

285
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,180
the best content.

286
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:04,280
They hold such deeply conservative views in many aspects, yet present them in such an

287
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,200
innocent and pure way, despite it making absolute sense.

288
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,980
For example, you wouldn't see Cody Ko make a video on the Westboro Baptist Church because

289
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,580
in many ways they're extremely aggressive and unlikable.

290
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,920
However, when the same sorts of views are presented like a cute bunny with a bow tie,

291
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,920
it's fair game.

292
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,040
Now, God defined are not the Westboro Baptist Church.

293
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,020
No, the point is aesthetics.

294
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,280
These play into the contrast of the message, and how easy it is to make content on it.

295
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,240
As culture changes, as time changes, the definition changes too, so how in the world do we know

296
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,420
what is true, what is right, when it comes to marriage?

297
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:42,120
We as Christians can look in God's word and see from the beginning, like we talked about,

298
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,700
God's constant truth, God's good plan for marriage.

299
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,720
So yeah, cultural progress, not allowed.

300
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:53,080
Gotta do it like we did it 2,000 years ago, guys.

301
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,080
This contrast can be witnessed in other videos that have received a bitter attention, such

302
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,680
as this Christian girl's mourning routine.

303
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:04,280
And that is so powerful, because the moment I step outside of my bedroom door, I'm going

304
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,880
to be attacked with lies upon lies upon lies from the enemy, because we live in a world

305
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,080
that is ruled by the father of lies.

306
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:17,920
So it is crucial, and it is essential that I get my armour of God on, and I fill my heart

307
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,400
with his truth.

308
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,280
Now from what I've understood is that this girl is actually autistic, and absolutely

309
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
lovely.

310
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,640
Equally, she's not really someone who uploads content on a regular basis, or who's tried

311
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,860
to actually create a brand, which is what Girl Defined have done.

312
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,600
These points all represent something greater.

313
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,320
Cultural accessibility, which is the real final nail in the coffin about how these girls

314
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,680
become such easy targets.

315
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:45,040
There are plenty of people who make fundamentalist statements, but most of them exist within

316
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,860
environments that we do not fully understand, therefore we're hesitant to go after them

317
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,280
because we don't want to be seen as punching down to a different culture in different contexts.

318
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,240
With white-bred Christian girls in a seemingly privileged scenario, it seems that there's

319
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,160
basically nothing to punch down to.

320
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,600
In many ways, they are perceived to represent the religious establishment.

321
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,960
Equally, this is what makes their statements so amusing at some points, the seeming perception

322
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,880
that they are fighting the culture.

323
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,080
So why do all these responses get so many views?

324
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,700
Well, it seems that the reason that responses to Girl Defined's content is so popular

325
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,380
is because the ideas they propose are so isolated from how people perceive them that people

326
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:25,480
just can't get enough of videos telling them why they're wrong, or just taking the

327
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,480
mick.

328
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,560
They're kinda funny, kinda awkward, it's not the sort of content that most people want

329
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
to watch unironically.

330
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:35,220
But once you see someone reacting or responding, it adds so much more value.

331
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,920
The people just love to see anything about them.

332
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,880
It is the pinnacle of transformative content.

333
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,240
Girl Defined aren't really that controversial.

334
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,180
Their views are a bit iffy for me, obviously, gay marriage and all that, but having dodgy

335
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:51,960
takes because you're extremely religious is not the same as Onision or Amberlynn who

336
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,160
are just beyond saving in many ways.

337
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,840
These girls seem pretty safe.

338
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,120
Was it worth it to save sex for marriage?

339
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,120
What do y'all think?

340
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,120
I mean, absolutely.

341
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,240
And when these little factors came together, what really set them off was the classic domino

342
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,240
effect.

343
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,240
It became clear that the videos on this topic were well performing, plenty of people wanted

344
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,600
in on the clownery.

345
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,160
Because there's no real risk in covering them for whatever audience you have.

346
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,280
No one's really gonna come out in their droves to defend these two girls who, as nice and

347
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,940
innocent as they seem, similarly love to present ideas that to many people are absolutely ridiculous,

348
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,680
whether people genuinely think they deserve it or not.

349
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,800
People can't really find a way to defend them because they neither say anything particularly

350
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,240
insightful nor do they seem particularly aggrieved in any way.

351
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,600
And that's generally what we look for when we try to defend people.

352
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,400
Is this the logic we should be using?

353
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:50,840
Well, let's discuss it a bit further.

354
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,260
The ultimate irony of what makes their content so easy to mock is that they promote such

355
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:00,720
pure sanitary behaviour which is given the green light through YouTube on the basis of

356
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,120
social norms.

357
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,240
Many of which have carried through from older social norms, the ones that often seem to

358
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,900
present as radical and out there, unlike the regularly demonetised LGBT content which is

359
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,560
presented by YouTubers so mainstream.

360
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,160
It makes it easy to mock without the threat of demonetisation or restriction while simultaneously

361
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,680
dealing out interesting cultural points of view.

362
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,440
Girl Defined don't appear to monetise their videos, but it's quite clear that most of

363
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,520
it would be fairly advertiser friendly, I mean, they arguably promote more conservative

364
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,760
views than people who've been banned off Patreon and they're on Patreon.

365
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,840
I don't mind, I think a lot more content should be fair game for monetisation, but

366
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,000
it equally shows the weird cultural double standards that we may still adhere to.

367
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,760
Through all of this, they ultimately become one of the easiest targets on YouTube, not

368
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,960
just for comedy, but also for commentary.

369
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,960
They're accessible, presentable, easy to watch, and in many ways the contrast between

370
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,800
their very mainstream attitude to their sudden mentioning of God creates this sort of dystopian

371
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,440
image of these friendly, happy girls talking to you about what God wants you to do.

372
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:23,600
With the right music, I'm sure we can make that into something much more intense.

373
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,000
The point is, it can be equally comedic and unsettling, giving it a lot of creative potential

374
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,520
for multiple creators, but do they really deserve it, or are they just under attack

375
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,360
from a culture that just can't include them anymore?

376
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,800
Are they really fighting their fight?

377
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,400
The thing is that, in a way, given the direction of general human culture right now in the

378
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,560
western world, particularly that which is represented on YouTube, waiting to kiss before

379
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,400
marriage could certainly be seen as different.

380
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,440
I mean, it's certainly not something that a majority of us do nowadays, but they seem

381
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,320
to be confusing things we're not doing as things we're told we shouldn't be doing.

382
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,800
This is where the general counter-cultural argument comes into play.

383
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,240
So, not the thing anymore.

384
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,640
Teen girls and young women are no longer taught in mainstream to save sex for marriage.

385
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,440
We're taught now to have safe sex, to be safe and cautious in the way we go about it, but

386
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:22,320
purity truly has become a thing of the past, and we are told by our culture that having

387
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,720
sex before marriage, that's a good thing, go for it, just be safe about it.

388
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,720
But that is a lie, and something we need to recognise as Christian girls, that that is

389
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,200
not God's best for us, that is not his perfect plan.

390
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,960
Having sex before marriage is not a good thing.

391
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,660
The reason that certain behaviours were considered, quote, punk back in the day was not because

392
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:45,760
most people didn't do it, it was because society specifically told them that it's something

393
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,000
they shouldn't do.

394
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,200
So doing all these dirty, grimy activities was a defiant cry against society.

395
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,560
No society, as we currently know it, is going to condemn you for waiting until marriage

396
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,560
to kiss.

397
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,120
If a person's friend told them that they were going to do that, I'm sure most people would

398
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,840
say something along the lines of, okay, nice, and carry on with their day.

399
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,820
Not exactly the same reaction as telling someone you were gay 40 years ago, or even today in

400
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,080
some scenarios.

401
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,520
Girl Defined are not radical.

402
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,780
They may be different, but they're existing without persecution.

403
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:23,040
But all right, if you went into a Girl Defined comment section, you could very easily say

404
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,520
there is a bias against them speaking about these things.

405
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,760
However, the whole idea of countercultural movements was that people shouldn't be telling

406
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,360
others how to live, something that Girl Defined is basing their brand on.

407
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,260
So it's debatable if on concept they can ever really frame their presentation of religion

408
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,760
as countercultural.

409
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,960
Now we all have moral discussions about what should be done, it's a core element to our

410
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,960
platform.

411
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,960
We can't all be miserable nihilists.

412
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,080
But if I was to assert a moral position, I would also be completely opening myself up

413
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,440
to criticism on that perspective too, especially if others did not feel it was moral either.

414
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,000
Do I believe that Girl Defined should receive stick for talking about that sort of lifestyle?

415
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,360
Well, it depends.

416
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,720
On principle, these things are a person's choice, and if that choice is more conservative,

417
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
then that is fine.

418
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,340
And if they want to talk about how it's helped them, then it would seem mean-spirited to

419
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,720
take them down for that.

420
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,000
At the same time, the core philosophy that they promote is also one that is restrictive,

421
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,800
and not one that is a solution for everyone, and based on ideas that many people justifiably

422
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,520
don't agree with, and have called out.

423
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,180
Interestingly enough, many of the critical comments that I saw people referring to was

424
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:35,640
the potential harm this sort of philosophy could do to children, and in many ways I do

425
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,020
completely see that.

426
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:41,660
The rigidity of certain concepts is extremely hard on people who inherently don't fit

427
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:46,740
into those molds, especially at a time when religion was very invested in the system,

428
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:51,380
and that whole discourse should in a way be a discussion primarily for adults, and yet

429
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,700
weirdly enough their content could very easily be seen as some of the most child-friendly

430
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,980
content on YouTube at some points.

431
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:01,540
That's because although we've modernised many points of view to be inclusive, we've

432
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:05,860
also held onto some fairly traditional principles, for better and for worse.

433
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:10,060
To get me wrong, sexual self-control is not a bad thing, as we've seen over the last

434
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,060
few years.

435
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,780
I mean, I never have sex, and it's definitely not because I'm alone and sad, I promise

436
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:19,460
it's just because I have restraints, but when it leads into topics that probably should

437
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:23,860
be talked about with a bit more ease, many people tend to get uptight about it, large

438
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,060
corporations included.

439
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:29,420
At the start of this video, I spoke about missionaries, and how they have constantly

440
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:33,020
existed and called Girl Defined internet missionaries.

441
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:36,900
After watching enough videos by Girl Defined, given how they often don't really try and

442
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,980
justify God, I wouldn't say they're very traditional in their style.

443
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:45,900
A lot of their content just comes across as catered primarily for Christians, even though

444
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,660
they've said they want to reach out to other people.

445
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,540
Proverbs 31 30 says, and you probably know this first, that charm is deceptive and beauty

446
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:56,540
is fleeting, but a woman who fears the Lord, she is to be praised.

447
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:01,020
However, because their content exists on a platform that can be accessed by anyone, and

448
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:05,500
because they often try and talk about content from a social perspective, it can reach many

449
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,300
people, it can be understood by many people, and it can be argued by many people, and for

450
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,900
what it's worth, it is great arguing material.

451
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,420
On surface value, the shock of the more basic points of view are great for comedy, and below

452
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,860
the surface, their justifications for it are great for discussion.

453
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:25,740
What they provide is still a relatively mainstream view in some communities, therefore people

454
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,460
have no discomfort criticising it, yet on YouTube, because of the politics of the YouTube

455
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:35,660
base tending to be rather anti-sex police, left wing or right wing, people also feel

456
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:40,660
enjoyment of them being responded to without feeling that they're unfairly going after

457
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,580
people, despite the fact that they're clearly outnumbered.

458
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,660
Given the views are not completely off the table and do have moral implications, it is

459
00:28:47,660 --> 00:29:15,620
kinda justified if people want to respond.

460
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,900
If you believe in God, it's fair enough, I'm not going to tell you what and what not

461
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:24,820
to believe, but there is something so fascinating about the people so convinced of the belief

462
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:30,460
they believe that you can dictate many people's behaviours, and it will just free their mind,

463
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,100
even if they're seemingly rather inconsequential.

464
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:38,580
The idea of a normal YouTuber who is also extremely Christian is embodied by the content

465
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:43,500
of Girl Defined, which is what ultimately makes them so open to the ridicule and rebuttal

466
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,780
that they often receive, we should all do our best to define ourselves, however it

467
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:52,580
is inevitable that many people will not find that definition in religion, and this is something

468
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,660
that Girl Defined don't seem to quite grasp.

469
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:00,520
Although it's clear they've defined themselves, Girl Defined's content and responses to

470
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,440
it may be overdone, but their ideas and videos are the sort of stuff we loved seeing people

471
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,260
clap back to, and they've marked it in a way that makes it perfect for just that.

472
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:15,220
So credit where credit's due, and hey, they even get free promotion, the Lord does indeed

473
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:19,620
work in mysterious ways.

474
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:24,100
So yeah, that's the video, I hope you guys enjoyed it, it felt good recording this one,

475
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,960
it felt nice, it felt good fun, it's good when you have a good feeling recording something

476
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,800
and you're just in that energy, so thank you, I wanna give a big shout out to my editors,

477
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,460
they better have done a good job with this one because I was coming in with the energy

478
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,160
today, it's fantastic.

479
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:44,900
Big shout out to my Patreons, some of the beautiful, beautiful people up there on screen

480
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:49,940
now, thank you so much guys, you are fantastic, I have to give a special individual thanks

481
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:56,720
to my $50 Patreons, Bo Wright, JewelAngel1, and Sumhullablue, thank you so much, and the
