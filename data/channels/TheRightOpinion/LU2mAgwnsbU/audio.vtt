00:00.000 --> 00:26.060
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of A2AT with too

00:26.060 --> 00:28.020
much free time.

00:28.020 --> 00:29.020
Why are we here?

00:29.040 --> 00:32.260
Not this video of course, though you may be asking that question as well, to be honest

00:32.260 --> 00:36.500
I ask that question on a fairly regular basis, but on this grand earth, when you think too

00:36.500 --> 00:40.380
much about it, like I have on many nights, it almost seems incredible that out of all

00:40.380 --> 00:45.300
the odds, we are here, existing, at the same time we are rational beings who like to make

00:45.300 --> 00:49.220
sense of phenomena, and questions that seem beyond our understanding, however one of the

00:49.220 --> 00:53.300
most challenging questions that has ever faced mankind is why are we here?

00:53.300 --> 00:57.740
Ask people, and you will receive a surprising variety of answers, for the nihilist who believes

00:57.740 --> 01:00.900
that we're just here to f**king die, to the astrologist who believes the stars have

01:00.900 --> 01:02.140
all aligned in our favour.

01:02.140 --> 01:06.620
One of the most common explanations for why we're here is the notion of a higher celestial

01:06.620 --> 01:08.220
being, or a god.

01:08.220 --> 01:12.900
For many people, it makes sense, either through philosophical explanation or personal experience.

01:12.900 --> 01:17.060
The notion of a god can be very beneficial for many people, however it's not just an

01:17.060 --> 01:21.380
individual opinion, although everyone of course has their own perception, typically an individual's

01:21.380 --> 01:25.620
belief in a higher celestial power will be made sense through the lens of religion.

01:25.620 --> 01:29.380
Religion allows people to categorise their core perceptions a bit more clearly, and often

01:29.380 --> 01:34.020
provide elaboration as to what sort of behaviours may be desirable from the perspective of a

01:34.020 --> 01:35.020
god.

01:35.020 --> 01:39.140
This is typically content that will reach into our daily life, our diet, our relationships,

01:39.140 --> 01:40.140
our behaviour.

01:40.140 --> 01:44.300
How we define ourselves is very important, and having religion as a moral foundation

01:44.300 --> 01:48.980
for behaviour gives people much more clarity in what they believe, and in spite of its

01:48.980 --> 01:52.460
flaws, it does help many people define themselves.

01:52.460 --> 01:56.360
Many people who may be lacking purpose will find it in religion, and many may develop

01:56.360 --> 02:00.940
a keen enthusiasm for it, and will want people to see that they have seen it.

02:00.940 --> 02:04.460
They will want to spread the word, they will become missionaries of sorts.

02:04.460 --> 02:07.780
Now back in the days of old, missionaries travelled all over the world to spread the

02:07.780 --> 02:11.660
word of religion, and do their best to convert individuals who may be otherwise sceptical

02:11.660 --> 02:12.980
of what they preach.

02:12.980 --> 02:15.180
Some people still do that to this day.

02:15.180 --> 02:18.420
And speaking of nuts, I have a nut here, okay?

02:18.420 --> 02:20.100
And this is a bolt, okay?

02:20.100 --> 02:22.980
So listen, this is what a normal person does, alright?

02:22.980 --> 02:25.660
See I got the bolt right here, represent the male, right?

02:25.660 --> 02:28.340
We got the nut right here, represent the female, alright?

02:28.340 --> 02:30.660
This is what normal people do, okay?

02:30.660 --> 02:41.580
This is what, now let me show you what insanity says to do.

02:41.580 --> 02:45.820
With mixed results, but others have felt the need to modernise the medium of how they spread

02:45.820 --> 02:48.220
their knowledge, and this has led us to YouTube.

02:48.220 --> 02:52.900
YouTube is the medium for influence, there are so many people who use YouTube for multiple

02:52.900 --> 02:57.020
purposes from all over the world, and you don't have to leave your room to post content

02:57.020 --> 03:00.040
there, it truly is revolutionary for communication.

03:00.040 --> 03:03.660
YouTube's user base is also pretty young, and given that young people are least likely

03:03.660 --> 03:07.940
to belong to religion, this leads to a target audience that is primed for conversion to

03:07.940 --> 03:10.240
whatever religion they choose.

03:10.240 --> 03:14.760
Now at first it seemed that most religious content uploaded was just broadcasts of preachers

03:14.760 --> 03:18.040
providing their religious wisdom to their congregation.

03:18.040 --> 03:21.960
Because of the cultural variety within these preachers, this definitely led to some unique

03:21.960 --> 03:27.880
insight into what happens in certain churches.

03:28.780 --> 03:45.540
It

03:45.540 --> 03:49.220
is quite wondrous to be honest, but that's why we're here today, because eventually many

03:49.220 --> 03:54.260
creators popped up whose content wasn't just a broadcast, but an actual direct creation,

03:54.260 --> 03:58.400
with the purpose of talking directly to you, the viewer, to tell you about the joys of

03:58.400 --> 04:02.020
religion, and as mentioned there are many religions, but the one we will be focusing

04:02.020 --> 04:07.100
on today is one that I assume you guys are a bit more familiar with, Christianity.

04:07.100 --> 04:10.980
Christianity has been one of the culturally dominant religions in the western world over

04:10.980 --> 04:15.280
observable history, for better and for worse, and because of its cultural dominance, it

04:15.280 --> 04:19.680
feels natural that it would be one of the most commonly represented on a fairly westernised

04:19.680 --> 04:24.080
platform, though mind you, looking at T-Series, the internet is certainly expanding.

04:24.080 --> 04:28.000
For now, I assume most of the people who watch my channel are typically exposed to

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
the same brand of religious creator that I am, and that brings us to Girl Defined.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.520
Girl Defined, or Girl Defined Ministries if you're feeling extra godly, is the Christian

04:37.520 --> 04:40.260
channel owned by sisters Bethany and Kristen.

04:40.260 --> 04:45.500
They are what I would brand as internet missionaries, providing a modern update to the age old messages

04:45.500 --> 04:47.120
preached in the bible.

04:47.120 --> 04:51.200
Now they've been going for a good five years, and over that time they have put out a consistent

04:51.200 --> 04:55.340
stream of content which, although varying in their delivery, is still focusing on the

04:55.340 --> 05:00.240
core message, that we should act in the way that God has intended us to, and avoid sinful

05:00.240 --> 05:01.240
behaviour.

05:01.240 --> 05:04.540
They also have their own website where they publish various thoughts, they're selling

05:04.540 --> 05:08.760
their own books, and they're even going on tour apparently, so they must really have

05:08.760 --> 05:09.760
a following.

05:09.760 --> 05:13.360
This seems fairly unexceptional to an extent, there are plenty of people who do this, and

05:13.360 --> 05:17.240
arguably there are many people who do it in a much more provocative fashion.

05:17.280 --> 05:21.720
In fact, on first glance, two white bread girls talking about how to behave in a Christian

05:21.720 --> 05:25.080
way seems like one of the most regular concepts for a channel.

05:25.080 --> 05:29.440
However, over the years, and in particular since around 2018, they have been the centre

05:29.440 --> 05:33.900
of attention for multiple YouTubers, who have made videos mocking or critiquing their content

05:33.900 --> 05:36.140
and the narratives that they promote through this.

05:36.140 --> 05:41.120
One video by prominent YouTuber comedian Cody Ko, in which he reacts to various Girl Defined

05:41.120 --> 05:43.660
videos, has over 12 million views on it.

05:43.700 --> 05:48.100
That means 12 million people decide to tune in to watch someone react to this.

05:48.100 --> 05:52.820
My guy obsession didn't happen all at once, it was a slow, gradual process to where it

05:52.820 --> 05:56.380
was the first thought, then the second thought, then making an effort to be near him, then

05:56.380 --> 06:00.380
doing this, until eventually it became the most important thing in my life.

06:00.380 --> 06:02.940
I mean, it's not quite endgame, is it?

06:02.940 --> 06:07.460
Nonetheless, since then, it's been collateral for creators to pile and to clown on these

06:07.460 --> 06:08.460
lasses.

06:08.460 --> 06:12.380
It is a savage, never-ending cycle with more dunking than a Michael Jordan game.

06:12.380 --> 06:17.420
Girl Defined have become one of the few creators, alongside the likes of Amblin, Reed and Onision,

06:17.420 --> 06:21.060
where videos about them typically pull more views than their own videos.

06:21.060 --> 06:24.740
However, unlike these two, the reason is quite a different one, I believe.

06:24.740 --> 06:26.420
So what did they do?

06:26.420 --> 06:28.980
Well, that's what we're here to find out today.

06:28.980 --> 06:33.680
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, today my goal will be to analyse Girl Defined's content, work

06:33.680 --> 06:38.520
out their appeal, try to understand them in the cultural landscape, attempt to apprehend

06:38.520 --> 06:43.480
why they seem to occupy such a unique niche, and try to understand what the appeal is to

06:43.480 --> 06:46.360
comedians, commentators, and bullies alike.

06:46.360 --> 06:51.160
Jake Paul knows, to ascertain exactly how Girl Defined became one of YouTube's biggest

06:51.160 --> 06:52.160
targets.

06:52.160 --> 07:05.140
I suggest we get right in there.

07:05.140 --> 07:09.420
The first video up on Girl Defined's channel is a video in which they decide to ask various

07:09.420 --> 07:14.700
students of what appears to be a university campus of what a quote girl really is.

07:14.700 --> 07:18.180
The point that they were trying to prove through this video was that in the modern day, many

07:18.180 --> 07:21.780
people do not understand what really defines a girl.

07:21.780 --> 07:26.820
They're about to suggest that they are God-defined girls in a culture-defined world.

07:26.820 --> 07:31.660
God has the key to understanding what womanhood really is, and once you understand it too,

07:31.660 --> 07:33.480
you can be as complete as them.

07:33.480 --> 07:37.040
And as girls go, they seem pretty defined.

07:37.040 --> 07:41.160
I guess this video was to essentially set the premise of the sort of identity crisis

07:41.160 --> 07:43.900
that many of our younger generations appear to face.

07:43.900 --> 07:47.600
It's clear in the interviews that many people can't really answer the questions that Bethany

07:47.600 --> 07:49.880
and Kristen put forth so confidently.

07:49.880 --> 07:53.400
They clearly perceive this as a pressing issue that they want resolved.

07:53.400 --> 07:58.240
They are defined girls, not like these formless blobs out there, and they are here to spread

07:58.240 --> 07:59.880
that definition to you.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.440
So how are they going to do that?

08:01.880 --> 08:04.320
Well first, let's begin to work out solutions.

08:04.320 --> 08:07.860
You have to discern the source of this identity crisis that we perceive.

08:07.860 --> 08:12.760
This is central to a lot of Girl Defines videos, but for research purposes, I decide to watch

08:12.760 --> 08:13.760
them from the start.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.640
And the strangest thing happened.

08:15.640 --> 08:17.160
I started to agree with them.

08:17.160 --> 08:19.680
When people wanted me, I felt like I was worth something.

08:19.680 --> 08:23.640
When they didn't, I felt like my worth went down, and that is one of the biggest lies

08:23.640 --> 08:24.640
in the industry.

08:24.640 --> 08:25.640
That's true.

08:25.640 --> 08:29.560
Another thing I noticed is that behind the scenes, all those happy smiling faces, all

08:29.560 --> 08:33.600
these perfect lives that we see on TV and on the posters, really aren't there.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.680
So many of the girls I knew were really insecure.

08:36.680 --> 08:40.240
They were struggling with basing their worth and their identity on their looks as well.

08:40.240 --> 08:44.360
And in fact, we've read a quote from a famous supermodel who actually said that in the modeling

08:44.360 --> 08:48.960
industry, the famous models that she knew were some of the most insecure women.

08:48.960 --> 08:52.240
So the truth is, what we see on the posters, what we see on the magazines, what we see

08:52.240 --> 08:55.720
on the TV, isn't actually the true definition of womanhood.

08:55.720 --> 08:57.240
Yeah, I'm not going to deny that.

08:57.240 --> 08:58.240
It looks good.

08:58.240 --> 08:59.240
It smiles.

08:59.240 --> 09:02.040
It looks pretty, but it's actually counterfeit.

09:02.040 --> 09:06.200
For example, self-worth in the beauty industry is a very real problem, and the fact that

09:06.200 --> 09:10.600
there was almost an anecdotal opening made it a lot more accessible, made the problem

09:10.600 --> 09:12.760
seem a lot more resonant as well.

09:12.760 --> 09:15.080
As a side note, I read their writing prompts.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.080
Pretty good stuff.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.520
I might have to write a cheeky article for them one day.

09:18.520 --> 09:23.880
After three of our book Girl Defined, we actually dive into what we call three pillars of counterfeit

09:23.880 --> 09:24.880
femininity.

09:24.880 --> 09:25.880
Oh, cheeky plug.

09:25.880 --> 09:27.880
So anyhow, what is their solution?

09:27.920 --> 09:31.360
Hey guys, it's Kristen and Bethany here with Girl Defined Ministries, and this is video

09:31.360 --> 09:35.080
number two in our series, Four Secrets to Brave and Bold Womanhood.

09:35.080 --> 09:38.560
Video number two was called The Power of Embracing God-Defined Womanhood.

09:38.560 --> 09:39.560
Oh, right.

09:39.560 --> 09:40.560
Yeah, I forgot.

09:40.560 --> 09:41.560
It's a channel about God.

09:41.560 --> 09:45.040
The second truth that we came across is that Christ defines our worth.

09:45.040 --> 09:48.960
As women, just like we shared in the last video, we are always searching for, okay,

09:48.960 --> 09:49.960
what gives me worth?

09:49.960 --> 09:50.960
What gives me value?

09:50.960 --> 09:51.960
What gives me identity?

09:51.960 --> 09:55.760
And the verse that we discovered that has given us a lot of hope is Psalm 139, 13 through

09:55.760 --> 09:56.760
14.

09:56.760 --> 09:57.760
You may know it.

09:57.920 --> 09:59.060
You created it for God.

09:59.060 --> 10:00.560
You created my immoral parents.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.480
You knitted me together in my mother's womb.

10:02.480 --> 10:06.080
I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

10:06.080 --> 10:10.080
I mean, here you have these girls who are arguably outlined a very reverent problem

10:10.080 --> 10:13.600
within our society, and their solution is gods.

10:13.600 --> 10:17.560
On the surface, it doesn't really make much sense, but what they're actually trying to

10:17.560 --> 10:20.700
say, well, I think this one quote's quite interesting.

10:20.700 --> 10:24.080
We live in a culture like we talked about in the last video that is totally obsessed

10:24.080 --> 10:25.440
with outward appearances.

10:25.440 --> 10:30.240
So we have our culture that portrays models and beautiful women as the ideal woman, but

10:30.240 --> 10:34.420
God's version of a successful and beautiful woman is actually totally opposite, totally

10:34.420 --> 10:36.520
countercultural to what we see out in the world.

10:36.520 --> 10:40.360
Proverbs 31, 30 says, and you probably know this first, that charm is deceptive and beauty

10:40.360 --> 10:44.400
is fleeting, but a woman who fears the Lord, she is to be praised.

10:44.400 --> 10:48.260
And basically all that verse is saying is that it's not as important what's on the outside.

10:48.260 --> 10:50.540
The outward appearance is not the main thing.

10:50.540 --> 10:51.540
It's fleeting.

10:51.540 --> 10:52.540
Yeah, exactly.

10:52.540 --> 10:53.540
It's going to go away.

10:53.540 --> 10:55.500
Inside is what really matters.

10:55.500 --> 10:59.860
God's saying a woman who fears the Lord, a woman who looks to my word and strives to

10:59.860 --> 11:02.680
honor me and live according to my standards.

11:02.680 --> 11:06.720
That is the woman that should be praised, not the woman who has the outward beauty.

11:06.720 --> 11:11.260
Here I think they outline why religion is so meaningful to them, because in society,

11:11.260 --> 11:14.780
many people are fearful that their worth will be defined by the judgment of others.

11:14.780 --> 11:19.280
But basically, girl-defying creates almost a logical tautology in a way, by making the

11:19.280 --> 11:21.780
statement that only Christ can define their worth.

11:21.780 --> 11:26.020
They are handing over a level of security to the viewer to view themselves in the eyes

11:26.020 --> 11:27.020
of Christ.

11:27.020 --> 11:31.900
Now the thing is, in their eyes, Christ or God is presented as the divine being, and

11:31.900 --> 11:36.560
in this instance, well, all forgiving, and therefore it takes the responsibility of judgment

11:36.560 --> 11:41.540
away from society and those around you, and places it into the conception of a person

11:41.540 --> 11:46.420
who will judge you how you believe they will judge you, rather than being the subject to

11:46.420 --> 11:51.700
direct judgment that could obviously be problematic, because no one can judge as perfectly as

11:51.700 --> 11:52.700
God.

11:52.700 --> 11:53.700
He is our creator.

11:53.700 --> 11:55.120
He is the one who gives us worth.

11:55.120 --> 11:58.900
No one else can give us our worth, because he didn't create us, we have no authority

11:58.900 --> 11:59.900
to give us our worth.

11:59.900 --> 12:03.820
Christ gives us our worth, and understanding that truth has given us a lot of hope.

12:03.820 --> 12:07.700
Establishing the premise of God seems to be the basis of their content, which is also

12:07.700 --> 12:10.660
why they're so confident in the rhetoric they espouse.

12:10.660 --> 12:16.060
They see God as diametrically opposed to culture, and thus present the argument of his existence

12:16.060 --> 12:19.340
as the solution to the societal ills that they perceive.

12:19.340 --> 12:23.980
The issue is that other skeptics and atheists will reject the assertion that God exists,

12:23.980 --> 12:28.460
and this then creates a disparity of discourse when people who are not accepting of the concept

12:28.460 --> 12:30.620
of God encounter their content.

12:30.620 --> 12:35.060
What happens is that in some videos, Girl Defined explicitly present the notion of God

12:35.060 --> 12:36.940
existing as a premise.

12:36.940 --> 12:41.420
However in others, they mostly mention it in passing, which makes their cultural commentary

12:41.420 --> 12:43.700
the perfect balance for people to react to.

12:43.700 --> 13:08.300
Digestible, yet kind of bizarre.

13:08.300 --> 13:11.660
The problem is, ultimately many of us view religion as culture.

13:11.660 --> 13:15.780
Even if we are religious, we will likely accept that our perception is our perception.

13:15.780 --> 13:20.380
In the instance of Girl Defined, the rejection of religion as culture means that they often

13:20.380 --> 13:25.100
make arguments from the position of Christianity as truth, not as perception.

13:25.100 --> 13:29.260
Therefore this often leads to arguments being made from the position of certainty rather

13:29.260 --> 13:30.800
than conditionality.

13:30.800 --> 13:35.940
Now arguing that God exists is not inherently bad, but there is such a conviction to a lot

13:35.940 --> 13:40.580
of Girl Defined's social statements that so many people will find so inherently grey

13:40.580 --> 13:45.100
about how we should behave, and how you can define things like identity.

13:45.100 --> 13:50.020
Therefore Girl Defined's rhetoric often comes across as self-satisfied and conceited, and

13:50.020 --> 13:54.180
people love the feeling that they're talking back to a self-asserted authority.

13:54.180 --> 13:58.980
Now make no mistake, it's important that people do feel confident in their identity, but Girl

13:58.980 --> 14:04.800
Defined reduced the number of identities possible or acceptable down to a few very basic ideas

14:04.800 --> 14:09.060
of what in this instance a girl should be, and this leads to statements that when you

14:09.060 --> 14:13.200
remove the ideas of their basic philosophy become very easy to mock.

14:13.200 --> 14:17.660
But you see, I've only really explained why their logic becomes somewhat funny, a logic

14:17.660 --> 14:20.020
that, in all fairness, many people have.

14:20.020 --> 14:24.220
There are many more details which make Girl Defined a little different to the rest of

14:24.220 --> 14:35.820
the bunch.

14:35.820 --> 14:40.100
Now we've presented and assessed the underlying mindset of Girl Defined, and how that one

14:40.100 --> 14:44.300
principle would cause issues, we need to look at how they have really come to stand out

14:44.300 --> 14:45.300
from the crowd.

14:45.300 --> 14:47.680
Let's start with their presentation.

14:47.680 --> 14:52.380
Presentation is key to any creator who wants a long-term career on YouTube, and Girl Defined

14:52.380 --> 14:53.700
definitely have that.

14:53.700 --> 14:58.180
As said, generally presentation is clear and legible, the aesthetic is nice and clean,

14:58.180 --> 15:02.300
and their videos have a clear structure, they are done in a way that would be quite regular

15:02.300 --> 15:03.300
for a YouTuber.

15:03.300 --> 15:08.400
However, the problem is, as shown by other videos, that whole environment is very saccharine,

15:08.400 --> 15:12.160
and they use such a repetitive structure, it becomes very forced.

15:12.160 --> 15:16.860
Go back a few years, and there was that brand of ukulele music that everyone abhors now,

15:16.860 --> 15:18.140
and justifiably so.

15:18.140 --> 15:22.500
To describe it, if stock ukulele tracks were a Christian YouTube channel, they'd be Girl

15:22.500 --> 15:32.020
Defined.

15:32.020 --> 15:36.140
Many people have picked up on this, and have commented on how in a way the content seems

15:36.140 --> 15:37.420
catered to children.

15:37.420 --> 15:41.500
Now in my opinion, they're not actually trying to sell the content to children, they're selling

15:41.500 --> 15:45.200
what they believe is the ideal image of pure femininity.

15:45.200 --> 15:50.300
This is how they idealise womanhood, that sort of virginal purity, and for some reason

15:50.300 --> 15:56.180
a big proportion of internet comedy is cynically deconstructing that of which appears pure.

15:56.180 --> 16:00.700
Maybe it's just because of the contrast in tones, but Girl Defined's general tone tends

16:00.700 --> 16:13.620
to come across as lacking some self-awareness.

16:13.620 --> 16:17.380
And that's the thing, after watching enough of their videos, I wouldn't say they lack

16:17.380 --> 16:20.980
awareness, I'd say it's their agenda.

16:20.980 --> 16:25.440
Actually sounds worse to be honest, but given their ideas of purity, it is completely in

16:25.440 --> 16:27.780
line with how they present the content.

16:27.780 --> 16:53.340
This is the sort of stuff that they are repulsed by for example.

16:53.340 --> 16:58.320
It's easy to goof on because of the assumptions they make in this lovely wholesome environment.

16:58.320 --> 17:02.840
What is normal to many people is terrible to them, and their horror at the thought that

17:02.840 --> 17:07.040
plagues into comedic potential because when we think of terrible things we don't think

17:07.040 --> 17:08.040
of porn.

17:08.040 --> 17:12.500
They are extremely sensitive, and that is entertaining because it seems bizarre even

17:12.500 --> 17:15.480
if it makes complete sense to them because of their religion.

17:15.480 --> 17:19.580
As mentioned, if you want to guest post on their website, they drop clear and concise

17:19.580 --> 17:21.200
guidelines on how to.

17:21.200 --> 17:25.160
Unsurprisingly, these guest guidelines reflect how they present their videos.

17:25.160 --> 17:30.120
They really like telling stories, and on one hand, this makes their content easier to digest.

17:30.120 --> 17:33.200
They're not just throwing a barrage of bible quotes at you.

17:33.200 --> 17:37.200
However, because the stories are actually quite interesting, it's easier to provide

17:37.200 --> 17:42.100
good comedic material out of them, particularly in how they use them often to justify various

17:42.100 --> 17:45.680
doctrines that seem a bit separated from the stories they tell.

17:45.680 --> 17:49.700
It's the same reason that comedians love to tell stories, different material in this

17:49.700 --> 17:50.700
instance.

17:50.700 --> 17:54.780
Most of the videos on them present them as these people who are so deeply indoctrinated

17:54.780 --> 17:58.780
with what they believe, and I think that's the great contrast that arguably provides

17:58.780 --> 18:00.180
the best content.

18:00.180 --> 18:04.280
They hold such deeply conservative views in many aspects, yet present them in such an

18:04.280 --> 18:08.200
innocent and pure way, despite it making absolute sense.

18:08.200 --> 18:11.980
For example, you wouldn't see Cody Ko make a video on the Westboro Baptist Church because

18:11.980 --> 18:14.580
in many ways they're extremely aggressive and unlikable.

18:14.580 --> 18:18.920
However, when the same sorts of views are presented like a cute bunny with a bow tie,

18:18.920 --> 18:19.920
it's fair game.

18:19.920 --> 18:23.040
Now, God defined are not the Westboro Baptist Church.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.020
No, the point is aesthetics.

18:25.020 --> 18:29.280
These play into the contrast of the message, and how easy it is to make content on it.

18:29.280 --> 18:34.240
As culture changes, as time changes, the definition changes too, so how in the world do we know

18:34.240 --> 18:37.420
what is true, what is right, when it comes to marriage?

18:37.420 --> 18:42.120
We as Christians can look in God's word and see from the beginning, like we talked about,

18:42.120 --> 18:45.700
God's constant truth, God's good plan for marriage.

18:45.700 --> 18:47.720
So yeah, cultural progress, not allowed.

18:47.720 --> 18:53.080
Gotta do it like we did it 2,000 years ago, guys.

18:53.080 --> 18:57.080
This contrast can be witnessed in other videos that have received a bitter attention, such

18:57.080 --> 18:59.680
as this Christian girl's mourning routine.

18:59.680 --> 19:04.280
And that is so powerful, because the moment I step outside of my bedroom door, I'm going

19:04.280 --> 19:08.880
to be attacked with lies upon lies upon lies from the enemy, because we live in a world

19:08.880 --> 19:11.080
that is ruled by the father of lies.

19:11.080 --> 19:17.920
So it is crucial, and it is essential that I get my armour of God on, and I fill my heart

19:17.920 --> 19:19.400
with his truth.

19:19.400 --> 19:23.280
Now from what I've understood is that this girl is actually autistic, and absolutely

19:23.280 --> 19:24.280
lovely.

19:24.280 --> 19:27.640
Equally, she's not really someone who uploads content on a regular basis, or who's tried

19:27.640 --> 19:30.860
to actually create a brand, which is what Girl Defined have done.

19:30.860 --> 19:33.600
These points all represent something greater.

19:33.600 --> 19:38.320
Cultural accessibility, which is the real final nail in the coffin about how these girls

19:38.320 --> 19:40.680
become such easy targets.

19:40.680 --> 19:45.040
There are plenty of people who make fundamentalist statements, but most of them exist within

19:45.040 --> 19:48.860
environments that we do not fully understand, therefore we're hesitant to go after them

19:48.860 --> 19:53.280
because we don't want to be seen as punching down to a different culture in different contexts.

19:53.280 --> 19:57.240
With white-bred Christian girls in a seemingly privileged scenario, it seems that there's

19:57.240 --> 19:59.160
basically nothing to punch down to.

19:59.160 --> 20:02.600
In many ways, they are perceived to represent the religious establishment.

20:02.600 --> 20:06.960
Equally, this is what makes their statements so amusing at some points, the seeming perception

20:06.960 --> 20:08.880
that they are fighting the culture.

20:08.880 --> 20:12.080
So why do all these responses get so many views?

20:12.080 --> 20:16.700
Well, it seems that the reason that responses to Girl Defined's content is so popular

20:16.700 --> 20:21.380
is because the ideas they propose are so isolated from how people perceive them that people

20:21.380 --> 20:25.480
just can't get enough of videos telling them why they're wrong, or just taking the

20:25.480 --> 20:26.480
mick.

20:26.480 --> 20:29.560
They're kinda funny, kinda awkward, it's not the sort of content that most people want

20:29.560 --> 20:30.560
to watch unironically.

20:30.560 --> 20:35.220
But once you see someone reacting or responding, it adds so much more value.

20:35.220 --> 20:37.920
The people just love to see anything about them.

20:37.960 --> 20:40.880
It is the pinnacle of transformative content.

20:40.880 --> 20:43.240
Girl Defined aren't really that controversial.

20:43.240 --> 20:47.180
Their views are a bit iffy for me, obviously, gay marriage and all that, but having dodgy

20:47.180 --> 20:51.960
takes because you're extremely religious is not the same as Onision or Amberlynn who

20:51.960 --> 20:54.160
are just beyond saving in many ways.

20:54.160 --> 20:55.840
These girls seem pretty safe.

20:55.840 --> 20:58.120
Was it worth it to save sex for marriage?

20:58.120 --> 20:59.120
What do y'all think?

20:59.120 --> 21:01.120
I mean, absolutely.

21:01.120 --> 21:05.240
And when these little factors came together, what really set them off was the classic domino

21:05.240 --> 21:06.240
effect.

21:06.240 --> 21:10.240
It became clear that the videos on this topic were well performing, plenty of people wanted

21:10.240 --> 21:11.600
in on the clownery.

21:11.600 --> 21:15.160
Because there's no real risk in covering them for whatever audience you have.

21:15.160 --> 21:19.280
No one's really gonna come out in their droves to defend these two girls who, as nice and

21:19.280 --> 21:24.940
innocent as they seem, similarly love to present ideas that to many people are absolutely ridiculous,

21:24.940 --> 21:27.680
whether people genuinely think they deserve it or not.

21:27.680 --> 21:31.800
People can't really find a way to defend them because they neither say anything particularly

21:31.800 --> 21:35.240
insightful nor do they seem particularly aggrieved in any way.

21:35.240 --> 21:38.600
And that's generally what we look for when we try to defend people.

21:38.600 --> 21:40.400
Is this the logic we should be using?

21:40.400 --> 21:50.840
Well, let's discuss it a bit further.

21:50.840 --> 21:55.260
The ultimate irony of what makes their content so easy to mock is that they promote such

21:55.260 --> 22:00.720
pure sanitary behaviour which is given the green light through YouTube on the basis of

22:00.720 --> 22:02.120
social norms.

22:02.120 --> 22:06.240
Many of which have carried through from older social norms, the ones that often seem to

22:06.240 --> 22:11.900
present as radical and out there, unlike the regularly demonetised LGBT content which is

22:11.900 --> 22:14.560
presented by YouTubers so mainstream.

22:14.560 --> 22:19.160
It makes it easy to mock without the threat of demonetisation or restriction while simultaneously

22:19.160 --> 22:21.680
dealing out interesting cultural points of view.

22:21.680 --> 22:25.440
Girl Defined don't appear to monetise their videos, but it's quite clear that most of

22:25.440 --> 22:29.520
it would be fairly advertiser friendly, I mean, they arguably promote more conservative

22:29.520 --> 22:32.760
views than people who've been banned off Patreon and they're on Patreon.

22:32.760 --> 22:36.840
I don't mind, I think a lot more content should be fair game for monetisation, but

22:36.840 --> 22:41.000
it equally shows the weird cultural double standards that we may still adhere to.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.760
Through all of this, they ultimately become one of the easiest targets on YouTube, not

22:44.760 --> 22:46.960
just for comedy, but also for commentary.

22:46.960 --> 22:51.960
They're accessible, presentable, easy to watch, and in many ways the contrast between

22:51.960 --> 22:56.800
their very mainstream attitude to their sudden mentioning of God creates this sort of dystopian

22:56.800 --> 23:01.440
image of these friendly, happy girls talking to you about what God wants you to do.

23:01.440 --> 23:23.600
With the right music, I'm sure we can make that into something much more intense.

23:23.600 --> 23:29.000
The point is, it can be equally comedic and unsettling, giving it a lot of creative potential

23:29.000 --> 23:33.520
for multiple creators, but do they really deserve it, or are they just under attack

23:33.520 --> 23:36.360
from a culture that just can't include them anymore?

23:36.360 --> 23:38.800
Are they really fighting their fight?

23:38.800 --> 23:43.400
The thing is that, in a way, given the direction of general human culture right now in the

23:43.400 --> 23:47.560
western world, particularly that which is represented on YouTube, waiting to kiss before

23:47.560 --> 23:50.400
marriage could certainly be seen as different.

23:50.400 --> 23:54.440
I mean, it's certainly not something that a majority of us do nowadays, but they seem

23:54.440 --> 23:59.320
to be confusing things we're not doing as things we're told we shouldn't be doing.

23:59.320 --> 24:02.800
This is where the general counter-cultural argument comes into play.

24:02.800 --> 24:05.240
So, not the thing anymore.

24:05.240 --> 24:10.640
Teen girls and young women are no longer taught in mainstream to save sex for marriage.

24:10.640 --> 24:16.440
We're taught now to have safe sex, to be safe and cautious in the way we go about it, but

24:16.440 --> 24:22.320
purity truly has become a thing of the past, and we are told by our culture that having

24:22.320 --> 24:25.720
sex before marriage, that's a good thing, go for it, just be safe about it.

24:25.720 --> 24:29.720
But that is a lie, and something we need to recognise as Christian girls, that that is

24:29.720 --> 24:33.200
not God's best for us, that is not his perfect plan.

24:33.200 --> 24:35.960
Having sex before marriage is not a good thing.

24:35.960 --> 24:40.660
The reason that certain behaviours were considered, quote, punk back in the day was not because

24:40.660 --> 24:45.760
most people didn't do it, it was because society specifically told them that it's something

24:45.760 --> 24:47.000
they shouldn't do.

24:47.000 --> 24:52.200
So doing all these dirty, grimy activities was a defiant cry against society.

24:52.200 --> 24:56.560
No society, as we currently know it, is going to condemn you for waiting until marriage

24:56.560 --> 24:57.560
to kiss.

24:57.560 --> 25:01.120
If a person's friend told them that they were going to do that, I'm sure most people would

25:01.120 --> 25:06.840
say something along the lines of, okay, nice, and carry on with their day.

25:06.840 --> 25:11.820
Not exactly the same reaction as telling someone you were gay 40 years ago, or even today in

25:11.820 --> 25:13.080
some scenarios.

25:13.080 --> 25:15.520
Girl Defined are not radical.

25:15.520 --> 25:18.780
They may be different, but they're existing without persecution.

25:18.780 --> 25:23.040
But all right, if you went into a Girl Defined comment section, you could very easily say

25:23.040 --> 25:26.520
there is a bias against them speaking about these things.

25:26.520 --> 25:30.760
However, the whole idea of countercultural movements was that people shouldn't be telling

25:30.760 --> 25:35.360
others how to live, something that Girl Defined is basing their brand on.

25:35.360 --> 25:40.260
So it's debatable if on concept they can ever really frame their presentation of religion

25:40.260 --> 25:41.760
as countercultural.

25:41.760 --> 25:45.960
Now we all have moral discussions about what should be done, it's a core element to our

25:45.960 --> 25:46.960
platform.

25:46.960 --> 25:48.960
We can't all be miserable nihilists.

25:48.960 --> 25:54.080
But if I was to assert a moral position, I would also be completely opening myself up

25:54.080 --> 25:59.440
to criticism on that perspective too, especially if others did not feel it was moral either.

25:59.440 --> 26:04.000
Do I believe that Girl Defined should receive stick for talking about that sort of lifestyle?

26:04.000 --> 26:05.360
Well, it depends.

26:05.360 --> 26:09.720
On principle, these things are a person's choice, and if that choice is more conservative,

26:09.720 --> 26:10.720
then that is fine.

26:10.720 --> 26:14.340
And if they want to talk about how it's helped them, then it would seem mean-spirited to

26:14.340 --> 26:15.720
take them down for that.

26:15.720 --> 26:20.000
At the same time, the core philosophy that they promote is also one that is restrictive,

26:20.000 --> 26:24.800
and not one that is a solution for everyone, and based on ideas that many people justifiably

26:24.800 --> 26:27.520
don't agree with, and have called out.

26:27.520 --> 26:31.180
Interestingly enough, many of the critical comments that I saw people referring to was

26:31.180 --> 26:35.640
the potential harm this sort of philosophy could do to children, and in many ways I do

26:35.640 --> 26:37.020
completely see that.

26:37.020 --> 26:41.660
The rigidity of certain concepts is extremely hard on people who inherently don't fit

26:41.660 --> 26:46.740
into those molds, especially at a time when religion was very invested in the system,

26:46.740 --> 26:51.380
and that whole discourse should in a way be a discussion primarily for adults, and yet

26:51.380 --> 26:55.700
weirdly enough their content could very easily be seen as some of the most child-friendly

26:55.700 --> 26:57.980
content on YouTube at some points.

26:57.980 --> 27:01.540
That's because although we've modernised many points of view to be inclusive, we've

27:01.540 --> 27:05.860
also held onto some fairly traditional principles, for better and for worse.

27:05.860 --> 27:10.060
To get me wrong, sexual self-control is not a bad thing, as we've seen over the last

27:10.060 --> 27:11.060
few years.

27:11.060 --> 27:14.780
I mean, I never have sex, and it's definitely not because I'm alone and sad, I promise

27:14.780 --> 27:19.460
it's just because I have restraints, but when it leads into topics that probably should

27:19.460 --> 27:23.860
be talked about with a bit more ease, many people tend to get uptight about it, large

27:23.860 --> 27:25.060
corporations included.

27:25.060 --> 27:29.420
At the start of this video, I spoke about missionaries, and how they have constantly

27:29.420 --> 27:33.020
existed and called Girl Defined internet missionaries.

27:33.020 --> 27:36.900
After watching enough videos by Girl Defined, given how they often don't really try and

27:36.900 --> 27:40.980
justify God, I wouldn't say they're very traditional in their style.

27:40.980 --> 27:45.900
A lot of their content just comes across as catered primarily for Christians, even though

27:45.900 --> 27:48.660
they've said they want to reach out to other people.

27:48.660 --> 27:52.540
Proverbs 31 30 says, and you probably know this first, that charm is deceptive and beauty

27:52.540 --> 27:56.540
is fleeting, but a woman who fears the Lord, she is to be praised.

27:56.540 --> 28:01.020
However, because their content exists on a platform that can be accessed by anyone, and

28:01.020 --> 28:05.500
because they often try and talk about content from a social perspective, it can reach many

28:05.500 --> 28:10.300
people, it can be understood by many people, and it can be argued by many people, and for

28:10.300 --> 28:12.900
what it's worth, it is great arguing material.

28:12.900 --> 28:17.420
On surface value, the shock of the more basic points of view are great for comedy, and below

28:17.420 --> 28:20.860
the surface, their justifications for it are great for discussion.

28:20.860 --> 28:25.740
What they provide is still a relatively mainstream view in some communities, therefore people

28:25.740 --> 28:30.460
have no discomfort criticising it, yet on YouTube, because of the politics of the YouTube

28:30.460 --> 28:35.660
base tending to be rather anti-sex police, left wing or right wing, people also feel

28:35.660 --> 28:40.660
enjoyment of them being responded to without feeling that they're unfairly going after

28:40.660 --> 28:43.580
people, despite the fact that they're clearly outnumbered.

28:43.580 --> 28:47.660
Given the views are not completely off the table and do have moral implications, it is

28:47.660 --> 29:15.620
kinda justified if people want to respond.

29:15.620 --> 29:19.900
If you believe in God, it's fair enough, I'm not going to tell you what and what not

29:19.900 --> 29:24.820
to believe, but there is something so fascinating about the people so convinced of the belief

29:24.820 --> 29:30.460
they believe that you can dictate many people's behaviours, and it will just free their mind,

29:30.460 --> 29:33.100
even if they're seemingly rather inconsequential.

29:33.100 --> 29:38.580
The idea of a normal YouTuber who is also extremely Christian is embodied by the content

29:38.580 --> 29:43.500
of Girl Defined, which is what ultimately makes them so open to the ridicule and rebuttal

29:43.500 --> 29:47.780
that they often receive, we should all do our best to define ourselves, however it

29:47.780 --> 29:52.580
is inevitable that many people will not find that definition in religion, and this is something

29:52.580 --> 29:55.660
that Girl Defined don't seem to quite grasp.

29:55.660 --> 30:00.520
Although it's clear they've defined themselves, Girl Defined's content and responses to

30:00.520 --> 30:05.440
it may be overdone, but their ideas and videos are the sort of stuff we loved seeing people

30:05.440 --> 30:10.260
clap back to, and they've marked it in a way that makes it perfect for just that.

30:10.260 --> 30:15.220
So credit where credit's due, and hey, they even get free promotion, the Lord does indeed

30:15.220 --> 30:19.620
work in mysterious ways.

30:19.620 --> 30:24.100
So yeah, that's the video, I hope you guys enjoyed it, it felt good recording this one,

30:24.100 --> 30:28.960
