0	12720	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with
12720	17240	too much free time, and I have made a lot of videos in my time about sensitive topics.
17240	20520	In fact, I think it's important to discuss sensitive topics because often they are the
20520	24480	ones where they might be the most at stake, particularly situations that involve sensitive
24480	25480	individuals.
25480	29120	However, on the other hand, it is completely understandable why some people do not want
29120	32400	to talk about these things, because they may not feel comfortable enough to do the
32400	35840	topic justice, or you might just feel it would be inappropriate.
35840	39520	I'm not one of those people, I'm sure everyone has received that impression now, I think
39520	43140	as long as you're bringing some level of discourse to the subject, there is nothing that should
43140	44440	be holding you back.
44440	48360	However, today's subject I feel is something that is honestly bigger than anything I've
48360	52300	covered in the past, and there's no real way to get around that, so I will try to keep
52300	55800	my regular structure, but honestly, it's one of those things where I'm also going to have
55800	57600	to let the topic guide me.
57600	58960	Let's talk about Etika then.
58960	63280	Etika born Desmond Daniel Amifer was a YouTube slash streamer from New York.
63280	68880	He started YouTube in 2012 under the brand of Etika World Network, abbreviated to EW
68880	69880	Network.
69880	73920	Over the years, he gradually built up a mandate of content, covering various topics.
73920	77720	It was certainly a bit more gaming oriented, but there was a lot of variety in what he
77720	78880	chose to cover.
78880	83440	This was because he was such a personality, and clearly had a lot of passion for everything
83440	87940	he spoke about, and being consistently invested in what you're talking about is a quality
87940	89740	rarer than many assume.
89740	94500	Over the seven years on YouTube, he developed a following of around 800,000 subscribers,
94500	98740	with a significant amount of these coming throughout the 2017-18 period.
98740	102940	I can't really say too much about him myself because I wasn't too familiar with him, and
102940	107060	it would be disingenuous to pretend I was, however, just as a side note, it would be
107060	111760	really interesting to see someone do a more tribute style retrospective on him.
111760	114940	So what was it about this topic that appealed to me?
114940	119980	Towards the end of 2018, in the midst of a highly successful run, Etika's channel was
119980	120980	deleted.
120980	124620	However, this was not the typical YouTube termination where some untrained bot made
124620	128860	a decision because someone spoke about a sensitive topic, and it thought the video was flat earth
128860	129860	propaganda.
129860	134220	No, this was what appeared to be a fairly justified decision, as pornographic content
134220	137060	appeared to have been posted onto Etika's channel.
137060	140820	Following this, he then took to social media, where he posted multiple statements that seemed
140820	142180	to allude to suicide.
142180	146520	This is where I first heard about him, because when a large influencer with a lot of reputational
146520	150540	clout posts about suicide, it will rightfully cause concern within the community.
150540	155100	However, not too long after this, he responded to the concern, clarifying that he was okay,
155100	157820	and apologising for the panic that he may have caused.
157820	162220	Alright, so, situation over, we can all get back to our day jobs and sleep at night knowing
162220	164500	that Etika is absolutely fine.
164500	168500	Well, not quite, because Desmond wasn't as okay as he claimed to be.
168500	172380	However, these issues did not resurface until April 2019.
172380	175940	When the suicidal tendencies returned, he threatened to delete Twitter and had some
175940	179360	interesting comments for those who tried to confront him regarding this.
179360	182100	This then led to his arrest and hospitalisation.
182100	185620	Less than a couple weeks after this was followed by an unusual shift in which he appeared to
185620	189900	be under the impression that he was a god, yes, a celestial being that had transcended
189900	193340	humankind and was in complete control of their surroundings.
193340	197420	He posted an array of offensive content and subsequently blocked close friends who reached
197420	198420	out to him.
198420	202220	He was then detained by the police in which he informed everyone that the revolution would
202220	203700	not be televised.
203700	207560	He was released from hospital shortly after, at which point he posted the diagnosis which
207560	209380	included his full docs.
209380	213880	Another video then appeared showing him assaulting a police officer and being arrested again.
213880	217020	Throughout this, he had multiple back and forths with Drama Alert host and Internet
217020	218480	personality Keemstar.
218480	222900	This eventually led him to go on the show for an interview where it became pretty interesting.
222900	224740	Hey guys, what's going on?
224740	225740	It's me, the Antichrist.
225740	229320	I've come to purge the planet of all human life.
229320	233980	I will be dropping nuclear missiles very, very soon on every single human being.
233980	235060	Death means nothing.
235060	237440	Why are you all so scared of death for?
237440	240120	It means absolutely zero in the interim.
240120	241980	Why do you think I made Trump president?
241980	244180	We're about to get some fireworks real soon.
244180	245820	This is this is what I'm asking.
245820	248180	Was this a publicity stunt?
248180	250380	Oh, this is my world.
250380	252380	You are playing in my game.
252380	253840	This is all me.
253840	256440	Stop thinking so small, dreamy, creamy, creamy.
256440	257440	Shut up.
257440	258440	Wait, what kind of salad?
258440	261280	Do you have kale and spinach in that salad?
261280	262280	Mostly kale.
262280	263280	You have superfoods in that salad?
263280	264280	Mostly kale.
264280	265280	Oh, really?
265280	266280	I take a lot of vitamins.
266280	267280	You have to.
267280	269760	My mind has to be on top of its game.
269760	270760	Why are you fat?
270760	274800	The multiple changes in Etika's personality compared with other reasons that we'll discuss
274800	278880	relatively soon had really created a fork in the internet regarding the cause of the
278880	280880	mentality that he had adopted.
280880	285120	Some asserted that this was all a simulation, others believed some of his actions were very
285120	288440	real and that no man in his position would merely make this up.
288440	292480	However, although many people were justifiably concerned for his well-being, few could foresee
292480	294120	what was about to happen.
294120	299960	After some more escapades, on June the 19th, Etika posted a video titled I'm sorry to YouTube.
299960	304400	In the video, he lays out his thought process and how it has led him to his current predicament.
304400	308400	Even without the knowledge that this would ultimately be his last upload, it's a pretty
308400	309900	tough video to sit through.
309900	314040	He seems extremely remorseful and addresses a lot of his recent ventures with a level
314040	316060	of reflection not previously seen.
316060	319420	He states that he had been suffering from mental health issues, and his language implies
319420	321440	that he was planning on taking his own life.
321440	325580	He was reported missing on the 20th, and a bag with his belongings was found by the Manhattan
325580	326580	Bridge.
326580	328020	It was not looking too good.
328020	332220	People's worst fears were confirmed on the 24th of July when a body was recovered, and
332220	334900	by the 25th, it was confirmed to be Etika.
334900	338300	Even with the anticipation, the shock was immediate and felt by many.
338300	342480	It is clear that a large number of individuals saw themselves as having a very close relationship
342480	346580	with the streamer, even audiences who had merely casually viewed his content were visibly
346580	347580	shaken.
347580	351100	Etika isn't the first YouTuber to take his own life, but few had ever seen a person's
351100	353740	mental state unravel in front of their eyes.
353740	358300	This sparked a new discussion on how the online world and platforms treat mental health, with
358300	362860	many people pointing fingers at figures who had enabled his seemingly destructive actions.
362860	366360	In spite of the thoughts and prayers type mourning, there was an equal amount of visceral
366360	370780	passion in many people's feelings, feelings that were justified in many ways, but ultimately
370780	373880	overlooked a behaviour symptomatic of the culture.
373880	377480	One of the greatest issues was that people just didn't know how to react to someone like
377480	381400	Etika going off the rails, and others who didn't believe it was real at all.
381400	384520	Today, I intend to investigate and discuss that behaviour.
384520	387880	It's a hard one, I'm aware, and I do warn people in advance that we'll be dealing with
387880	389080	sensitive topics.
389080	393000	The main point I want to discuss is to what extent this was avoidable, and what can be
393000	395460	done in future scenarios to avoid this.
395460	406580	Let's begin this topic with a little history.
406580	410540	YouTube and international media has a complicated relationship with mental wellbeing.
410540	414300	On one hand, the increasing awareness for certain conditions has definitely aided people
414300	415500	in diagnoses.
415500	419820	In the past, and still in some places today, there has been a stigma around being mentally
419820	420820	ill.
420820	424240	Go back less than a hundred years ago, and even in many Western countries, the best way
424240	427920	to deal with someone who may be suffering from mental issues were straitjackets and
427920	428920	lobotomies.
428920	433700	However, many countries quickly realised, hey, this might not be such a grand idea,
433700	438520	and throughout the 20th century, many sweeping reforms took place that humanised and categorised
438520	440720	the conditions that many people suffered from.
440720	446340	In the UK, it wasn't until 1961 that all the asylums were closed by the then Health Minister
446340	450880	Enoch Powell, who might ring a bell for British viewers for slightly less positive reasons.
450880	454580	However, in the decades following, there were still a lot of issues regarding public
454580	459080	perception of mentally ill individuals, because as many people know, even if you change the
459080	463800	laws, many of the stereotypes around these individuals still remain, often perpetuated
463800	465720	by communities and the media.
465720	469680	It has certainly taken a long time for a lot of people to have their perceptions shifted,
469680	471200	but we are making progress.
471200	474200	However, when one problem goes away, another arises.
474200	479560	In fact, a plethora of them decide to materialise, all ingrained in modern culture, with the
479560	483760	increasing nuance surrounding mental disorders no longer was it perceived as this sort of
483760	485720	rabid person in a straight jacket.
485720	490080	We move towards trying to define the many shades, typically from a psychological perspective,
490080	494800	a mental disorder is something that impairs an individual from functioning in their personal
494800	497120	life, or causes significant distress.
497120	502100	Nowadays, instead of throwing people who may be mentally ill in an asylum, we try and account
502100	506160	for their personal illness in their behaviour, we try and treat it, we try and help them
506160	507320	improve.
507320	512280	People with mental illnesses are at a disadvantage, and we do like to help people, however at
512280	516380	the same time we only have limited energy and resources to help people, and we don't
516380	520640	like people exploiting mental illness, whether it's for money or for sympathy.
520640	525420	On top of this, a mental disorder does imply that an individual may not be fully responsible
525420	529820	for their actions, for example, it is regularly used as a defence in court, which might result
529820	532100	in a reduced sentence or a referral.
532100	536520	This has ultimately caused a lot of controversy, because actions and consequences would always
536520	541400	exist separate of the person conducting them, and many people have trouble finding justification
541400	543180	sometimes for people's actions.
543180	547320	On top of this, people know that a person's character isn't defined by their mental condition,
547320	551240	and to assume someone did something on the basis of mental illness alone might well be
551240	554660	a great disservice to other people going through the same thing.
554660	559160	There are a lot of blurred lines, if someone's a psychopath, they will receive a fairly harsh
559160	563680	sentence for a crime, many would argue rightfully so, but suffering from another disorder may
563680	565880	completely devolve responsibility.
565880	569120	Now there are many rational arguments for why this is, but equally, there are still
569120	573200	a lot of unknowns, and many of us don't quite know how to deal with this, however, because
573200	577180	people don't like blurred lines, and because people like to have opinions, this will lead
577180	580240	to people perhaps judging situations prematurely.
580240	583880	The discussion of mental illness has reared its head on multiple occasions relating to
583880	589080	popular YouTubers and even celebrities, sometimes it is done in a fairly poignant manner, however
589080	594340	on YouTube, a lot of the time, it is not so much, arguably one of the more recent situations
594340	598780	that had allegedly fairly deep ties to mental illness was FouseyTube's quite incredible
598780	602960	public display of what the hell is going on, with the failure that was FouseyCon, and all
602960	606180	subsequent demonstrations that we had the delight of observing.
606180	610820	At the time, there was an ambiguity regarding the role the mental health had played into
610820	615420	it, but there was a shared fixation on the failure that was FouseyCon, and the fact that
615420	619160	he had hyped up the appearance of multiple celebrities and brought people from all over
619160	623580	the country, and even the world, to attend to him basically standing on a car.
623580	628260	As a public figure, many people, myself included, placed a significant amount of responsibility
628260	632980	on him, and many others saw the idea of a mental problem as a scapegoat.
632980	637740	It's understandable, given Fousey's history of lies, deception, and manipulation, particularly
637740	638820	within his pranks.
638820	642620	The people's patience was worn relatively thin by then, equally though, regardless of
642620	646300	whether he was stimulating or not, at the time it received a lot of attention.
646300	650440	Ultimately, the whole stunt seemed to be done for one reason, attention, it felt like a
650440	654880	person going one step further to retain the feeling of attention that he once had.
654880	659280	It was a fairly sad situation, and regardless of the attention given to him in the moment,
659280	661940	these sorts of acts are much alike to crying wolf.
661940	666320	You may gain attention at first, but people will begin to ignore it towards the end, and
666320	669040	like that, Fousey faded into the background.
669040	672820	Now there are many creators who talk about these issues, but prior to Etika, Fousey's
672820	677880	incident was the most recent public demonstration that has sparked debate about mental health's
677880	679480	involvement in accountability.
679520	684160	Ultimately, the conclusion was clear, the sooner the spotlight was off him, the better.
684160	687760	If someone only lives for attention, then they cannot survive, because unless you're
687760	692240	the bloody queen, people can't invest themselves in every single celebrity.
692240	694820	Not everything you do will be interesting.
694820	698600	There are many reasons that people come down harder on public figures, but the main reason
698600	703840	is because many creators and YouTubers make videos for a purpose, attention, but attention
703840	706280	isn't typically given, it's earned.
706280	710440	YouTubers want creators to work hard for their engagement, people can fake being insane,
710440	714240	but many people don't, because they know how it would trivialise the genuine cases
714240	715240	of insanity.
715240	719900	However, this promotes a scarcity in these incidents, so that when they occur, they receive
719900	721620	unconditional attention.
721620	726600	The concept of a mental breakdown is attention in the worst way for many reasons, and therefore
726600	730440	if people think it's faked, then they might feel cheated, they've given their attention
730440	734080	to someone's suffering when they could have given it to someone else who deserved it,
734080	738920	or for the emotional impact that witnessing a person allegedly suffering might cause.
738920	743060	People don't want to be taken for fools, however scepticism can sometimes manifest
743060	745720	and be applied where it probably isn't needed.
745720	750000	Now many people would say that today's situation is one of those instances, after all it's
750000	752560	quite clear that those who doubted him were in the wrong.
752560	757200	However, as always, I want to take a deeper dive and explore what made people think that
757200	763880	way, and if we could try and turn it round in the future.
763880	766040	People exist on a spectrum of scepticism.
766040	769760	When there are claims, there will always be people who are more likely to believe an individual
769760	773880	making those claims, and likely those who will have a higher burden of proof.
773880	776240	Both of these positions are somewhat justifiable.
776240	779600	One of the biggest problems with the Etika situation was that many people seemed to have
779600	784080	presumed positions on the basis of previous incidents and their own opinions.
784080	788040	This has been the product of much of the internet culture that has arisen over the last few
788040	792420	years, the sort of desperation to prove your own side right, but not really stopping to
792420	794540	analyse the actual information.
794540	799060	Let this be clear, this is not against anyone who may have quietly speculated about Etika's
799060	800180	mental health.
800180	805180	People are 100% entitled to those opinions, even if they are proven dubious in the future.
805180	807820	We all have our doubts, and I'm not one to please those.
807820	811100	However, there were many people who pushed ideas that really shouldn't have been the
811100	815480	focus of the situation at the time, nonetheless, they still existed.
815480	816480	Why did they?
816480	821340	Well, let's dissect some of the basic concepts of why people tend to doubt these things.
821340	823340	The first is reputation.
823340	827180	Public figures arguably get one of the worst wraps for mental health, despite the fact
827180	829640	that many times, they are equally as vulnerable.
829640	833180	This is mainly due to the conception that mental health issues typically come from a
833180	838220	lack of material items, such as money or a house, and as mentioned earlier, given creators
838220	843340	and their drive for attention, we are typically hesitant to dish out sympathy in their direction.
843340	847780	When people do certain things that seem like an immediate hunt for attention, people become
847780	849180	immediately sceptical.
849180	853420	In this instance, Etika's provocative moment of posting porn, followed by the numerous
853420	857120	suicidal threats, felt like a moment to shock the audience.
857120	861860	Although in hindsight, given some of his behavioural tics, it may have been foreseeable, many people,
861860	866480	particularly outsiders, saw it as too sudden a turn for it to not have taken some level
866480	867480	of orchestration.
867480	872260	However, the problem is, by focusing on the spikes of attention seeking, people overlook
872260	877380	the other conditions that may not explicitly be stated, but have to be taken into account.
877380	882060	By losing his channel, Etika practically lost six years of accumulated work that he
882060	886140	wasn't going to be able to get back, and alright, some might argue that it was a bombastic
886140	890500	way to torpedo his channel to focus on his other works, but he would have had to have
890500	895060	had a level of certainty that he was never going to return, and I don't think a creator
895060	897100	can logically grasp that often.
897100	901540	On top of that, the swarm of people who suddenly became interested in the topic seemed to dilute
901540	905360	those who actually knew Etika, thus creating a lack of perspective.
905360	910280	The response to Etika's behaviour ultimately became a spike, much reflecting the incidents
910280	914660	themselves, thus not really allowing people to look at his behaviour in between.
914660	919060	To add, there wasn't really anyone that close to him providing an unbiased perspective on
919060	920840	the mental well-being of Etika.
920840	925040	The greatest voice appeared to be Etika's ex-girlfriend, Alice Pika, who Etika was in
925040	931000	a relationship with between 2011 and 2017, however even then this did not seem to be
931000	932000	enough.
932000	935140	As an ex, Pika can only put herself through so much as well.
935140	938780	Even all the emotional baggage from a six-year relationship existing.
938780	941220	That can't be pleasant, I understand that.
941220	944860	In the months following, Etika apologised for his behaviour and seemingly returned to
944860	949920	his normal self, thus giving many a false sense of security regarding his mental stability.
949920	953820	As many people will tell you, just because someone may appear to seem stable, this doesn't
953820	958220	mean that they are, and an initial episode can often just be foreshadowing for what might
958220	959220	come after.
959220	963260	Ultimately, the difference between Etika and Fusi's episode is that what Etika did directly
963260	964260	harmed himself.
964260	967300	I'd much more compare his behaviour to that of Marina Joyce.
967300	971440	The difference is that at the time of the incident, Marina Joyce seemed completely void
971440	975660	of any motive for intention, and therefore it made people much more inclined to focus
975660	976660	on the issue.
976660	980180	Now don't get me wrong, there were people who didn't believe her either, but the difference
980180	984820	was that after her episode, she didn't return to the public spotlight in a way that Etika
984820	985820	did.
985820	988260	This leads us to the next issue, repetition.
988260	992960	People don't like the same things happening again and again, it is a classic rule of life.
992960	997400	As mentioned earlier, the story of The Boy Who Cried Wolf is a classic tale, but it's
997400	1001840	not necessarily accurate in this instance, because we know now that the first time that
1001840	1006900	Etika cried wolf, the wolf was very much existent, but ultimately that tale shows that if people
1006900	1011040	cannot directly see the wolf, there is no guarantee that they will believe the word
1011040	1013280	of the individual who claims they saw it.
1013280	1017120	The worst thing about mental health is that many of the issues are completely invisible
1017120	1021860	for those who judge a situation, and therefore when they return again, people, although more
1021860	1026740	likely to doubt it, don't necessarily have any actual proof that they didn't exist, which
1026740	1029060	leads to a lot of speculation.
1029060	1032120	During his second breakdown, he was transported to hospital.
1032120	1036340	In a way, this should have provided verification to the fact that he was not well, however
1036340	1040740	he returned home surprisingly quickly and posted a printout of his medical report to
1040740	1041740	the internet.
1041740	1045480	Now the fact that he doxxed himself was once again rather concerning, but the experts in
1045480	1048680	this instance had concluded that he suffered from agitation.
1048680	1052780	The appeal to this authority with what appeared to be a rather mild diagnosis appeared to
1052780	1056120	add credence to the theory that this was just some elaborate ruse.
1056120	1060720	The only other authority at that time, Alice Pika, was blocked, and although understandably
1060720	1064800	upset and frustrated at how she had been treated by someone she was trying to help, clumsily
1064800	1067560	tweeted out that he would not hurt himself.
1067560	1071160	Probably not the best thing to say, although like many, I'm sure she didn't realise the
1071160	1072720	consequences at the time.
1072720	1077200	As the incidents escalated, many people began to realise a ruse this was not, particularly
1077200	1080560	when it reached the point that he attacked a police officer, however some of the doubts
1080560	1084700	still lingered, not assisted by the fact that Etika had made somewhat facetious comments
1084700	1089240	and set up an OnlyFans page on the back of one of his breakdowns, a paid subscription
1089240	1090240	service.
1090240	1094040	Even up to the day that he committed suicide, there were people who theorised that this
1094040	1097480	was not legitimate, but it was, and now we are here.
1097480	1102200	I think the problem is that people overlook that whatever Etika stood to vaguely gain
1102200	1106280	from these situations was not sustainable, physically or mentally.
1106280	1110040	He had already lost a lot, pushed away a lot of his friends, and taken himself to a
1110040	1114360	stage of public reputation that was so, so far from where he was.
1114360	1118400	The seemingly very mixed nature of public response made people highly hesitant to take
1118400	1122600	any action at all, the lack of people close to him speaking out or taking action meant
1122600	1126680	that he was left alone or vulnerable, and the failure of authority to take him in and
1126680	1131680	treat him at a time of vulnerability had left him exposed to the very mixed nature of the
1131680	1135760	internet, and although there were many people who took these things seriously, there were
1135760	1140100	numbers who prevented a consensus from being created on the right thing to do.
1140100	1143920	Maybe someone would have been able to intercept this if the outcry was loud enough, but it
1143920	1148160	never was, and when we were faced down with the implications of not being able to prevent
1148160	1152400	something that could have been apprehended, many people turned to point fingers at people
1152400	1154540	who had instigated this environment.
1154540	1157080	But how accountable are they?
1157080	1160640	Let's discuss.
1160640	1162300	People like to doubt.
1162300	1165580	It's a problem, and one that surfaced in this situation.
1165580	1169320	As mentioned at the start of the video, one of the sides of mental health that we have
1169320	1173820	a greater understanding of is that it can alter the way we might judge a person, particularly
1173820	1178260	on the basis of their actions, however, some people don't identify it this way.
1178260	1180700	One of those people was Keemstar.
1180700	1185240	In what I think is now a deleted video, which I wish I could find, Keemstar states that
1185240	1189860	he acknowledges that chemical imbalances exist, but doesn't believe that implies mental illness.
1189860	1193900	This is a statement that is echoed throughout many of his other tweets, though he has since
1193900	1195500	deleted a lot of them.
1195500	1200200	Now, many people did not understand this take at all, but I almost have a twisted sense
1200200	1203500	of comprehension of what he's saying here, albeit clumsily.
1203500	1207220	He understands that there are certain people with chemical imbalances in their head to
1207220	1213300	a greater degree, however, does not believe this premises the classification of a mental illness.
1213300	1216700	Let's go into deep philosophy, and I'll try not to lose you.
1216700	1220420	Essentially, what Keemstar is saying is that different people are different, and that these
1220420	1225260	differences, even ones that seem to make people a bit seemingly insane, are not differences
1225260	1229980	that necessarily provide them with illnesses that might devolve them of responsibility.
1229980	1233740	At the heart of this issue, every single person will be slightly different in the way that
1233740	1237180	they behave, and the biochemical roots that drive the behaviour.
1237180	1241740	No two people are completely the same, and we can't necessarily account for the disadvantages
1241740	1243620	that those differences may provoke.
1243620	1247580	At the end of the day, these differences will lead us down different paths, and no one will
1247580	1251300	ever be 100% compatible with the environment around them.
1251300	1256260	For many people, the question is when the line between personal accountability and accountability
1256260	1258420	to a mental illness may be drawn.
1258420	1259980	It's a difficult question.
1259980	1264420	Without the existence of mental illness, that line is discarded, thus leading to some more
1264420	1266300	rather interesting discussions.
1266300	1270600	As spoke about earlier regarding the definition of mental illness, we stated that it was something
1270600	1275060	that impairs an individual from functioning in their personal life, or causes significant
1275060	1276060	distress.
1276060	1279560	In the modern world, that is particularly hard to define, and we won't get it right
1279560	1280560	every time.
1280560	1285200	But ultimately, the sort of theory that Keemstar promotes only tends to work if mental wellbeing
1285200	1287620	existed on a fairly even playing field.
1287620	1291180	The problem is that ultimately, those who may be mentally suffering, or going through
1291180	1295880	hard times in their head, are typically deviations from an ideal norm.
1295880	1300040	Now, it's important to clarify what's being said here, because social norms do evolve
1300040	1304960	and change, and to suggest a deviation may immediately qualify it as a mental illness
1304960	1305960	is rather aggressive.
1305960	1310620	But the thing is that a lot of these deviations seem a lot more scientifically based than
1310620	1312700	socially brought forward on their own.
1332700	1333700	And that's the thing.
1333700	1339000	While there is great debate over where the line should be drawn, many of us accept the
1339000	1340000	extremes.
1340000	1343820	It is clear that Etika was on this extreme, and therefore shouldn't have been entertained
1343820	1347520	in the same way that we might entertain a FouseyTube character.
1347520	1351580	Many people alleged that Keemstar's promotion of this opinion ultimately weighted him with
1351580	1353940	some accountability of the situation.
1353940	1360200	He had invited Etika onto his show, which had led him to a rather volatile confrontation.
1360200	1364620	Many people saw the mentality Keemstar promoted as warring, because it would lead you to treat
1364620	1369440	a mentally ill person with the same level of tact that you would treat a mentally well
1369440	1373920	person, and when that treatment's coming from Keemstar, well, he's not known for his gentility.
1390200	1408900	Keemstar
1408900	1411240	also famously made this comment.
1420200	1443220	Many commentators cited this as a reason for why he should be held to a standard for this
1443220	1446920	instant, and to be frank, I completely understand why.
1446920	1451540	It was extremely distasteful, especially with the context we now understand, but it's
1451540	1455780	difficult to see that Keemstar was actively encouraging the behaviour, it was more over
1455780	1460500	an abrupt response that was very, very poorly thought out.
1460500	1465620	But still, if you have someone in a high up position in a public community, would you
1465620	1468900	not expect them to behave with a bit more tact?
1468900	1472160	Well, yes, but no.
1472160	1477140	The media's exploitation of mental health has long existed prior to Keemstar, in a way
1477140	1481600	he was terrible, but although many people have argued that he enabled Etika's arguably
1481600	1485600	very destructive behaviour, it's important to remember the people who enabled Keemstar's
1485600	1491480	behaviour to the sort of approach that people enjoy, this sensationalisation from this media
1491480	1492480	figure.
1492480	1496200	If no one wanted Keemstar's coverage, then he wouldn't have pulled as many views in.
1496200	1499880	There weren't enough people stepping in and stating that this was literally the worst
1499880	1504120	way to go about it, and in a way, it would have been hard for people to do that without
1504120	1505960	the foresight of what would happen.
1505960	1510620	Now you could argue that Keemstar should have had that foresight, I agree, but he didn't,
1510620	1515460	because the lingering doubt held by many people that this was not legitimate, and simply because
1515460	1520480	Keemstar is no better in many ways, there wasn't an acknowledgement that the consequences
1520480	1522200	could have turned out this way.
1522200	1526560	On top of this, you can't really definitively say that if Keemstar and others alike hadn't
1526560	1530360	publicly mishandled this, Etika would have been absolutely fine.
1530360	1534940	Keemstar's interview was insensitive and messy, but I highly doubt it would have altered
1534940	1535940	too much.
1535940	1540460	I mentioned the Marina Joyce situation earlier, and when that situation transpired she appeared
1540460	1544760	on an interview with DeFranco, a seemingly more professional news source for sure, but
1544760	1548400	still with the providence of coverage and traffic nonetheless.
1548400	1553360	Keemstar's interview, although bad, is much more a symptom rather than a cause.
1553360	1557040	Ultimately, the difference was that there was just a lack of intervention from many
1557040	1561120	people, and those who did attempt to intervene weren't close enough to break through.
1561120	1565240	And honestly, I think the medical authority have come away with a lot less criticism than
1565240	1569040	they could be receiving, because they should have stepped in themselves, but they just
1569040	1572880	sent him back home under the impression that it was just a bit of agitation.
1572880	1577540	To my knowledge, they did not monitor him, despite his continuous public displays towards
1577540	1578940	himself and others.
1578940	1583460	It worries me to think how someone who's not a public figure like Etika would be treated.
1583460	1588100	And listen, Etika did undergo therapy after his first incident, and was clearly having
1588100	1592420	some sort of help, but I really think more could have been done on the side of professionals
1592420	1596420	with his initial incident in mind, because regardless of the environment online that
1596420	1601980	it is incredibly toxic and deserving of its own criticism, online people are not expert
1601980	1602980	therapists.
1602980	1608180	A lot of people, at least, we could all do a bit better from being a tad more compassionate,
1608180	1612980	I do not know if I could honestly blame any online individual for the way this situation
1612980	1617220	has transpired, because the handling was just a reapplied template.
1617220	1621180	No one really went out of their way to approach it differently, it's just for the first time
1621180	1625620	the outcome was very different, and people couldn't begin to rationalise why, so the
1625620	1630220	fingers started being pointed, when really it was a collective problem that the presence
1630220	1633920	of some and the absence of others contributed to.
1633920	1635020	Let's talk about that.
1638180	1646740	In Etika's final video, he re-treads the experiences he went through from a rather
1646740	1648100	solemn perspective.
1648100	1656540	I'm sorry yo, I'm sorry I betrayed your trust, I'm sorry I pushed you all away, I'm sorry
1656540	1664220	I made a clown of myself, I apologise, I wish it didn't have to be this way.
1664220	1669420	When Etika posted indecent content on YouTube, and lost so much that he had worked for, it
1669420	1673220	was a strange scenario that could have been handled very differently.
1673220	1678740	It was the beginning of a long track to the end, and it brought up a very difficult topic.
1678740	1683820	YouTube removed Etika's final video altogether, and this provoked many people to criticise
1683820	1684820	YouTube.
1684820	1689060	Many people have additionally called on YouTube to restore Etika's original channel, and for
1689060	1691580	what it's worth, I'd like to echo those calls.
1691580	1695780	I don't know how practically viable it is, but I think it's important to remember people
1695780	1699500	for what they should be remembered for, and regardless of what has happened over the last
1699500	1703500	year to Etika, the content that he brought to the website should always outweigh his
1703500	1707660	untimely passing, and I think YouTube should pay tribute to that.
1707660	1711340	YouTube may terminate or place sanctions on a channel for a multitude of reasons, but
1711340	1715980	for this situation, it seemed protective to make sure that an incident like that doesn't
1715980	1716980	occur again.
1716980	1721220	Etika himself was not someone with predatory intent, and still owned other channels on
1721220	1722220	the website.
1722220	1726180	With the owner of the channel no longer with us, it is quite clear that the incumbent threat
1726180	1730900	has ceased to be, and therefore it would be appropriate to, in my opinion, return the
1730900	1733520	channel, for friends, family, and fans alike.
1733520	1737460	With that out of the way, should they have ever terminated at all, if he was just going
1737460	1740060	through a mentally vulnerable episode?
1740060	1742460	In his video, something he said struck me.
1771060	1773740	But I ultimately turned down help.
1773740	1777260	And you know what they say, you can't help somebody who doesn't want to help themselves.
1777260	1780220	I just didn't realize I needed help.
1780220	1783140	That's how deluded I was, man.
1783140	1784140	It's not y'all fault.
1784140	1785940	I don't want you to blame yourselves.
1785940	1789100	It's all my fault.
1789100	1791860	I'm the one that pushed y'all away.
1791860	1797620	Then I deluded myself into thinking that somehow I didn't destroy a big part of my life, that
1797620	1799380	somehow I was ahead of the curve.
1799380	1802580	It was like that heavy delusion that I couldn't pull myself out of.
1802580	1804780	I didn't even know I was in it.
1804780	1807240	I was saying and doing things that made no sense.
1807240	1811740	The way he framed the situation was interesting, because although he takes some responsibility
1811740	1816700	for what had occurred, it almost felt like he perceived himself as having no other option
1816700	1819460	given the response to the other instance.
1819460	1824180	That was what I found so sad while watching the video, the idea that he perceived himself
1824180	1825220	as in a corner.
1825220	1828100	The only other option was to take his own life.
1828100	1831520	Whatever had provoked that shouldn't have occurred, and although there will be some
1831520	1835940	people who you will never be able to talk out of, I feel that Etika wasn't one of those
1835940	1836940	people.
1836940	1840580	I think he would have taken an outstretched hand if he felt it was right for him, but
1840580	1845340	in his time of vulnerability, many judged him and the authorities punished him, when
1845340	1850420	really he maybe should have just got his channel back and been monitored a bit more closely.
1850420	1854780	YouTube makes exceptions for people all the time, where they otherwise shouldn't, and
1854780	1858980	although you don't want to open the floodgates for people abusing the conditions, I just
1858980	1863040	don't feel like it would have, even if I don't have a crystal ball.
1863040	1866900	The point that I stated in brief light of this is that ultimately, whether completely
1866900	1871740	real or completely fake, the solution doesn't differ too much from an outsider's perspective,
1871740	1875860	but what we need to do is focus on people getting help from offline sources.
1875860	1879660	If someone has been driven to the point that they simulate a mental illness, then they
1879660	1883420	probably need a break and they're still likely suffering from something else.
1883420	1886860	If they're real, then there should be no question about the course of action.
1886860	1890700	This isn't to say we shouldn't have a discussion about this stuff and the consequences that
1890700	1891700	they may yield.
1891700	1895300	There are people who do abuse mental illness as scapegoats sometimes.
1895300	1898280	I've spoken about individuals who may be mentally vulnerable.
1898280	1902220	It doesn't necessarily put a person above criticism, but it's equally important the
1902220	1906340	sort of criticism that you'll be dealing out, and the sort of mentality that you promote
1906340	1907780	towards a person.
1908660	1913940	Let my story be one that advises caution on too much of the social media shit, man.
1913940	1915980	It can fuck you up.
1915980	1922060	It can give you an image of what you want your life to be, and it can get blown completely
1922060	1924820	out of proportion, dog.
1924820	1933500	Unfortunately, it consumed me, and it made me forget about consequences to my actions.
1933500	1935660	It made me forget that we have to pay for the things that we say.
1935660	1940580	It made me forget that there is weight behind words.
1940580	1943860	I was so consumed with this great image that I had had that I thought I was invulnerable
1943860	1944860	to everything.
1944860	1949460	As an example, Edgar said a lot of highly inflammatory things during his second mental
1949460	1954240	breakdown, and many people took the opportunity to write him off, it seems, due to the rigidity
1954240	1956380	of some people's moral compasses.
1956380	1961260	This doesn't validate any of what he said as remotely true or appropriate, and as separate
1961260	1965460	actions they could well be criticised, but they did not warrant people suddenly judging
1965460	1969480	a character that was clearly not completely present to think through their actions.
1969480	1974360	We have to be very careful when we assign a rigid moral value to certain actions that
1974360	1979660	discount mental state, because you will marginalise people who are suffering and mentally vulnerable,
1979660	1983120	and I know some people don't want to do that because they don't want certain things
1983120	1987100	to be quote humanised, but they are human, and when they're coming out of someone who
1987100	1991600	is losing their mind, it's not going to be from the perception of glorification that
1991600	1993460	you might criticise others for.
1993460	1997840	Let me make it clear, there are many reasons for why people might be pissed off, dangerous
1997840	2002060	behaviour shouldn't just be ignored, and it definitely shouldn't be encouraged, but
2002060	2006660	it felt like a lot of people used the doubt of legitimacy to write off whatever he was
2006660	2011420	going through, and give license to rather harsh judgement that he clearly felt.
2011420	2015780	He felt that he couldn't come back from this, and we should never make someone feel
2015780	2016780	like that.
2016780	2020860	We should never make someone like him feel like they can't have a second chance, because
2020860	2022980	I do think Edgar deserved it.
2023020	2027700	On top of this, although the online culture did come across as disappointingly unsympathetic,
2027700	2029140	it wasn't the sole cause.
2029140	2033560	It's not just the mob alone that will fully drive someone to insanity, it often requires
2033560	2038220	a lack of support from all corners, and you've got the feeling that Edgar just seems so alone
2038220	2042380	when he probably needed support most, and pushed many people away.
2042380	2047400	This isn't to say that there isn't an obligation on anyone to do more, maybe that was how Edgar
2047400	2052140	set himself up, and most people just didn't anticipate it, but it should always serve
2052140	2056300	as a reminder that if you have someone in your life that you care about, that you do
2056300	2060140	genuinely value, make sure you let them know from time to time.
2060140	2065180	At the end of the day, what we witness publicly is only the tip of a very deep iceberg, and
2065180	2068940	to judge the person from the situation alone is to miss the point.
2068940	2073020	However, it was something that many people did, maybe even something that I did when
2073020	2077420	I took a passing glance, but I think the best thing we can do is try and be more mindful
2077420	2079460	in the future of what might happen.
2079460	2083860	There'll be no way to fully prevent these things, and internet trolls will always exist,
2083860	2088300	but if we can have at least a few people re-evaluate the sort of statements they make, then we
2088300	2089820	might do a bit better.
2089820	2093740	As said at the start, I think this was the first time a community suffered something
2093740	2099500	so intimate to many people, and you can see it all over the site, but we learn, we grow,
2099500	2102560	and I hope next time we can do a bit better.
2102560	2107020	When people act like they are mentally suffering, it puts them in a position that isn't inherently
2107020	2108020	desirable.
2108020	2111460	Although I can understand why some people may think that such behaviour is baiting for
2111460	2115220	attention or sympathy, and I can understand why people may want to see who's telling
2115220	2119220	the truth and who isn't, because we want to be putting the right energy into the right
2119220	2123660	people, we still have to do it with sensitivity, and with the knowledge that we might be wrong.
2123660	2127580	Also, regardless of whether you believe mental illness to be real or not, the result of this
2127580	2132500	situation was from a specific mindset that does deserve exception in its treatment.
2132500	2136180	Whether that's due to society or not is another question, but unless you're planning
2136180	2140820	on being the person to uproot society, then you should probably play the game with caution.
2140820	2145260	I don't think you can hold a single individual accountable for the death of Etika, I think
2145260	2149500	it was a collective failure due to a limited perspective, though really, I wish someone
2149500	2153440	had just stepped in at the right time, and that's a reminder, if you have the power
2153440	2158700	to step in, then don't shy away, you really don't know the difference it might make.
2158700	2162580	As always with this sort of video, I'll leave links below to suicide hotlines, this
2162580	2167020	video will not be monetised, because I feel it's a situation that is bigger than all
2167020	2171480	of us, some people did suggest I monetise it and give the ad sense to charity, but I
2171480	2176540	feel that would just cause confusion, and it'd likely be demonetised anyway, there'll
2176540	2180920	be some links to reputable suicide charities below if you want to donate.
2180920	2184780	Take care of yourself, people.
2184780	2189700	So yes, that's the video, I want to give a thanks to my editors once again for their
2189700	2194500	work, I know that this is probably a situation close to many of their hearts, and I'm gonna
2194500	2198500	leave their links in the pinned comment, go and check them out, send them some love, because
2198500	2200500	I'm sure this was not an easy one for them.
2200500	2205660	I'd also like to give a big thanks to my Patreons, thank you for supporting me so much, it makes
2205660	2209740	a hell of a lot of difference, particularly when dealing with these topics, some of those
