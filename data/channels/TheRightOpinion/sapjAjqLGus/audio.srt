00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,720
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

2
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,240
too much free time, and I have made a lot of videos in my time about sensitive topics.

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,520
In fact, I think it's important to discuss sensitive topics because often they are the

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,480
ones where they might be the most at stake, particularly situations that involve sensitive

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,480
individuals.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,120
However, on the other hand, it is completely understandable why some people do not want

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,400
to talk about these things, because they may not feel comfortable enough to do the

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,840
topic justice, or you might just feel it would be inappropriate.

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,520
I'm not one of those people, I'm sure everyone has received that impression now, I think

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,140
as long as you're bringing some level of discourse to the subject, there is nothing that should

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,440
be holding you back.

12
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,360
However, today's subject I feel is something that is honestly bigger than anything I've

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,300
covered in the past, and there's no real way to get around that, so I will try to keep

14
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,800
my regular structure, but honestly, it's one of those things where I'm also going to have

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,600
to let the topic guide me.

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,960
Let's talk about Etika then.

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,280
Etika born Desmond Daniel Amifer was a YouTube slash streamer from New York.

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,880
He started YouTube in 2012 under the brand of Etika World Network, abbreviated to EW

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,880
Network.

20
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,920
Over the years, he gradually built up a mandate of content, covering various topics.

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,720
It was certainly a bit more gaming oriented, but there was a lot of variety in what he

22
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,880
chose to cover.

23
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,440
This was because he was such a personality, and clearly had a lot of passion for everything

24
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,940
he spoke about, and being consistently invested in what you're talking about is a quality

25
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,740
rarer than many assume.

26
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,500
Over the seven years on YouTube, he developed a following of around 800,000 subscribers,

27
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,740
with a significant amount of these coming throughout the 2017-18 period.

28
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,940
I can't really say too much about him myself because I wasn't too familiar with him, and

29
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:47,060
it would be disingenuous to pretend I was, however, just as a side note, it would be

30
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,760
really interesting to see someone do a more tribute style retrospective on him.

31
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,940
So what was it about this topic that appealed to me?

32
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,980
Towards the end of 2018, in the midst of a highly successful run, Etika's channel was

33
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,980
deleted.

34
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,620
However, this was not the typical YouTube termination where some untrained bot made

35
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,860
a decision because someone spoke about a sensitive topic, and it thought the video was flat earth

36
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,860
propaganda.

37
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:14,220
No, this was what appeared to be a fairly justified decision, as pornographic content

38
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,060
appeared to have been posted onto Etika's channel.

39
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,820
Following this, he then took to social media, where he posted multiple statements that seemed

40
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,180
to allude to suicide.

41
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,520
This is where I first heard about him, because when a large influencer with a lot of reputational

42
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,540
clout posts about suicide, it will rightfully cause concern within the community.

43
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,100
However, not too long after this, he responded to the concern, clarifying that he was okay,

44
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,820
and apologising for the panic that he may have caused.

45
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,220
Alright, so, situation over, we can all get back to our day jobs and sleep at night knowing

46
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,500
that Etika is absolutely fine.

47
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,500
Well, not quite, because Desmond wasn't as okay as he claimed to be.

48
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,380
However, these issues did not resurface until April 2019.

49
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,940
When the suicidal tendencies returned, he threatened to delete Twitter and had some

50
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,360
interesting comments for those who tried to confront him regarding this.

51
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,100
This then led to his arrest and hospitalisation.

52
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,620
Less than a couple weeks after this was followed by an unusual shift in which he appeared to

53
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,900
be under the impression that he was a god, yes, a celestial being that had transcended

54
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,340
humankind and was in complete control of their surroundings.

55
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,420
He posted an array of offensive content and subsequently blocked close friends who reached

56
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,420
out to him.

57
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,220
He was then detained by the police in which he informed everyone that the revolution would

58
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,700
not be televised.

59
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,560
He was released from hospital shortly after, at which point he posted the diagnosis which

60
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,380
included his full docs.

61
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,880
Another video then appeared showing him assaulting a police officer and being arrested again.

62
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,020
Throughout this, he had multiple back and forths with Drama Alert host and Internet

63
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,480
personality Keemstar.

64
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,900
This eventually led him to go on the show for an interview where it became pretty interesting.

65
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,740
Hey guys, what's going on?

66
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,740
It's me, the Antichrist.

67
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,320
I've come to purge the planet of all human life.

68
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,980
I will be dropping nuclear missiles very, very soon on every single human being.

69
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,060
Death means nothing.

70
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,440
Why are you all so scared of death for?

71
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,120
It means absolutely zero in the interim.

72
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,980
Why do you think I made Trump president?

73
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,180
We're about to get some fireworks real soon.

74
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,820
This is this is what I'm asking.

75
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,180
Was this a publicity stunt?

76
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,380
Oh, this is my world.

77
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,380
You are playing in my game.

78
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,840
This is all me.

79
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,440
Stop thinking so small, dreamy, creamy, creamy.

80
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,440
Shut up.

81
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,440
Wait, what kind of salad?

82
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,280
Do you have kale and spinach in that salad?

83
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,280
Mostly kale.

84
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,280
You have superfoods in that salad?

85
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,280
Mostly kale.

86
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,280
Oh, really?

87
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,280
I take a lot of vitamins.

88
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,280
You have to.

89
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,760
My mind has to be on top of its game.

90
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,760
Why are you fat?

91
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,800
The multiple changes in Etika's personality compared with other reasons that we'll discuss

92
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,880
relatively soon had really created a fork in the internet regarding the cause of the

93
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,880
mentality that he had adopted.

94
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,120
Some asserted that this was all a simulation, others believed some of his actions were very

95
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,440
real and that no man in his position would merely make this up.

96
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,480
However, although many people were justifiably concerned for his well-being, few could foresee

97
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,120
what was about to happen.

98
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,960
After some more escapades, on June the 19th, Etika posted a video titled I'm sorry to YouTube.

99
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,400
In the video, he lays out his thought process and how it has led him to his current predicament.

100
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,400
Even without the knowledge that this would ultimately be his last upload, it's a pretty

101
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,900
tough video to sit through.

102
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,040
He seems extremely remorseful and addresses a lot of his recent ventures with a level

103
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,060
of reflection not previously seen.

104
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,420
He states that he had been suffering from mental health issues, and his language implies

105
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,440
that he was planning on taking his own life.

106
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,580
He was reported missing on the 20th, and a bag with his belongings was found by the Manhattan

107
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,580
Bridge.

108
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,020
It was not looking too good.

109
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,220
People's worst fears were confirmed on the 24th of July when a body was recovered, and

110
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,900
by the 25th, it was confirmed to be Etika.

111
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,300
Even with the anticipation, the shock was immediate and felt by many.

112
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,480
It is clear that a large number of individuals saw themselves as having a very close relationship

113
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,580
with the streamer, even audiences who had merely casually viewed his content were visibly

114
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,580
shaken.

115
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,100
Etika isn't the first YouTuber to take his own life, but few had ever seen a person's

116
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,740
mental state unravel in front of their eyes.

117
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,300
This sparked a new discussion on how the online world and platforms treat mental health, with

118
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,860
many people pointing fingers at figures who had enabled his seemingly destructive actions.

119
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,360
In spite of the thoughts and prayers type mourning, there was an equal amount of visceral

120
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,780
passion in many people's feelings, feelings that were justified in many ways, but ultimately

121
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,880
overlooked a behaviour symptomatic of the culture.

122
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,480
One of the greatest issues was that people just didn't know how to react to someone like

123
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,400
Etika going off the rails, and others who didn't believe it was real at all.

124
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,520
Today, I intend to investigate and discuss that behaviour.

125
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,880
It's a hard one, I'm aware, and I do warn people in advance that we'll be dealing with

126
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,080
sensitive topics.

127
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,000
The main point I want to discuss is to what extent this was avoidable, and what can be

128
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,460
done in future scenarios to avoid this.

129
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:46,580
Let's begin this topic with a little history.

130
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,540
YouTube and international media has a complicated relationship with mental wellbeing.

131
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,300
On one hand, the increasing awareness for certain conditions has definitely aided people

132
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,500
in diagnoses.

133
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,820
In the past, and still in some places today, there has been a stigma around being mentally

134
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,820
ill.

135
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,240
Go back less than a hundred years ago, and even in many Western countries, the best way

136
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,920
to deal with someone who may be suffering from mental issues were straitjackets and

137
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
lobotomies.

138
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,700
However, many countries quickly realised, hey, this might not be such a grand idea,

139
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,520
and throughout the 20th century, many sweeping reforms took place that humanised and categorised

140
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,720
the conditions that many people suffered from.

141
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,340
In the UK, it wasn't until 1961 that all the asylums were closed by the then Health Minister

142
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,880
Enoch Powell, who might ring a bell for British viewers for slightly less positive reasons.

143
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,580
However, in the decades following, there were still a lot of issues regarding public

144
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,080
perception of mentally ill individuals, because as many people know, even if you change the

145
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,800
laws, many of the stereotypes around these individuals still remain, often perpetuated

146
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,720
by communities and the media.

147
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,680
It has certainly taken a long time for a lot of people to have their perceptions shifted,

148
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,200
but we are making progress.

149
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,200
However, when one problem goes away, another arises.

150
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:59,560
In fact, a plethora of them decide to materialise, all ingrained in modern culture, with the

151
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,760
increasing nuance surrounding mental disorders no longer was it perceived as this sort of

152
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,720
rabid person in a straight jacket.

153
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,080
We move towards trying to define the many shades, typically from a psychological perspective,

154
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,800
a mental disorder is something that impairs an individual from functioning in their personal

155
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,120
life, or causes significant distress.

156
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,100
Nowadays, instead of throwing people who may be mentally ill in an asylum, we try and account

157
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,160
for their personal illness in their behaviour, we try and treat it, we try and help them

158
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,320
improve.

159
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:32,280
People with mental illnesses are at a disadvantage, and we do like to help people, however at

160
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,380
the same time we only have limited energy and resources to help people, and we don't

161
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,640
like people exploiting mental illness, whether it's for money or for sympathy.

162
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,420
On top of this, a mental disorder does imply that an individual may not be fully responsible

163
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,820
for their actions, for example, it is regularly used as a defence in court, which might result

164
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,100
in a reduced sentence or a referral.

165
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,520
This has ultimately caused a lot of controversy, because actions and consequences would always

166
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,400
exist separate of the person conducting them, and many people have trouble finding justification

167
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,180
sometimes for people's actions.

168
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,320
On top of this, people know that a person's character isn't defined by their mental condition,

169
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,240
and to assume someone did something on the basis of mental illness alone might well be

170
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,660
a great disservice to other people going through the same thing.

171
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:19,160
There are a lot of blurred lines, if someone's a psychopath, they will receive a fairly harsh

172
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,680
sentence for a crime, many would argue rightfully so, but suffering from another disorder may

173
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,880
completely devolve responsibility.

174
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,120
Now there are many rational arguments for why this is, but equally, there are still

175
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,200
a lot of unknowns, and many of us don't quite know how to deal with this, however, because

176
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,180
people don't like blurred lines, and because people like to have opinions, this will lead

177
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,240
to people perhaps judging situations prematurely.

178
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,880
The discussion of mental illness has reared its head on multiple occasions relating to

179
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:49,080
popular YouTubers and even celebrities, sometimes it is done in a fairly poignant manner, however

180
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,340
on YouTube, a lot of the time, it is not so much, arguably one of the more recent situations

181
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,780
that had allegedly fairly deep ties to mental illness was FouseyTube's quite incredible

182
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,960
public display of what the hell is going on, with the failure that was FouseyCon, and all

183
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,180
subsequent demonstrations that we had the delight of observing.

184
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,820
At the time, there was an ambiguity regarding the role the mental health had played into

185
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,420
it, but there was a shared fixation on the failure that was FouseyCon, and the fact that

186
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,160
he had hyped up the appearance of multiple celebrities and brought people from all over

187
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,580
the country, and even the world, to attend to him basically standing on a car.

188
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,260
As a public figure, many people, myself included, placed a significant amount of responsibility

189
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,980
on him, and many others saw the idea of a mental problem as a scapegoat.

190
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,740
It's understandable, given Fousey's history of lies, deception, and manipulation, particularly

191
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,820
within his pranks.

192
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,620
The people's patience was worn relatively thin by then, equally though, regardless of

193
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,300
whether he was stimulating or not, at the time it received a lot of attention.

194
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,440
Ultimately, the whole stunt seemed to be done for one reason, attention, it felt like a

195
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,880
person going one step further to retain the feeling of attention that he once had.

196
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,280
It was a fairly sad situation, and regardless of the attention given to him in the moment,

197
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,940
these sorts of acts are much alike to crying wolf.

198
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,320
You may gain attention at first, but people will begin to ignore it towards the end, and

199
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,040
like that, Fousey faded into the background.

200
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,820
Now there are many creators who talk about these issues, but prior to Etika, Fousey's

201
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:17,880
incident was the most recent public demonstration that has sparked debate about mental health's

202
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,480
involvement in accountability.

203
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,160
Ultimately, the conclusion was clear, the sooner the spotlight was off him, the better.

204
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,760
If someone only lives for attention, then they cannot survive, because unless you're

205
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,240
the bloody queen, people can't invest themselves in every single celebrity.

206
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,820
Not everything you do will be interesting.

207
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,600
There are many reasons that people come down harder on public figures, but the main reason

208
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,840
is because many creators and YouTubers make videos for a purpose, attention, but attention

209
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,280
isn't typically given, it's earned.

210
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,440
YouTubers want creators to work hard for their engagement, people can fake being insane,

211
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,240
but many people don't, because they know how it would trivialise the genuine cases

212
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,240
of insanity.

213
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,900
However, this promotes a scarcity in these incidents, so that when they occur, they receive

214
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,620
unconditional attention.

215
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,600
The concept of a mental breakdown is attention in the worst way for many reasons, and therefore

216
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,440
if people think it's faked, then they might feel cheated, they've given their attention

217
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,080
to someone's suffering when they could have given it to someone else who deserved it,

218
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,920
or for the emotional impact that witnessing a person allegedly suffering might cause.

219
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,060
People don't want to be taken for fools, however scepticism can sometimes manifest

220
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,720
and be applied where it probably isn't needed.

221
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,000
Now many people would say that today's situation is one of those instances, after all it's

222
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,560
quite clear that those who doubted him were in the wrong.

223
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,200
However, as always, I want to take a deeper dive and explore what made people think that

224
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,880
way, and if we could try and turn it round in the future.

225
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,040
People exist on a spectrum of scepticism.

226
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,760
When there are claims, there will always be people who are more likely to believe an individual

227
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,880
making those claims, and likely those who will have a higher burden of proof.

228
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,240
Both of these positions are somewhat justifiable.

229
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,600
One of the biggest problems with the Etika situation was that many people seemed to have

230
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,080
presumed positions on the basis of previous incidents and their own opinions.

231
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,040
This has been the product of much of the internet culture that has arisen over the last few

232
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,420
years, the sort of desperation to prove your own side right, but not really stopping to

233
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,540
analyse the actual information.

234
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:19,060
Let this be clear, this is not against anyone who may have quietly speculated about Etika's

235
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,180
mental health.

236
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:25,180
People are 100% entitled to those opinions, even if they are proven dubious in the future.

237
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,820
We all have our doubts, and I'm not one to please those.

238
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,100
However, there were many people who pushed ideas that really shouldn't have been the

239
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,480
focus of the situation at the time, nonetheless, they still existed.

240
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,480
Why did they?

241
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,340
Well, let's dissect some of the basic concepts of why people tend to doubt these things.

242
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,340
The first is reputation.

243
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,180
Public figures arguably get one of the worst wraps for mental health, despite the fact

244
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,640
that many times, they are equally as vulnerable.

245
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,180
This is mainly due to the conception that mental health issues typically come from a

246
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:58,220
lack of material items, such as money or a house, and as mentioned earlier, given creators

247
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:03,340
and their drive for attention, we are typically hesitant to dish out sympathy in their direction.

248
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,780
When people do certain things that seem like an immediate hunt for attention, people become

249
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,180
immediately sceptical.

250
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,420
In this instance, Etika's provocative moment of posting porn, followed by the numerous

251
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,120
suicidal threats, felt like a moment to shock the audience.

252
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,860
Although in hindsight, given some of his behavioural tics, it may have been foreseeable, many people,

253
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:26,480
particularly outsiders, saw it as too sudden a turn for it to not have taken some level

254
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,480
of orchestration.

255
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,260
However, the problem is, by focusing on the spikes of attention seeking, people overlook

256
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:37,380
the other conditions that may not explicitly be stated, but have to be taken into account.

257
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:42,060
By losing his channel, Etika practically lost six years of accumulated work that he

258
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,140
wasn't going to be able to get back, and alright, some might argue that it was a bombastic

259
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:50,500
way to torpedo his channel to focus on his other works, but he would have had to have

260
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,060
had a level of certainty that he was never going to return, and I don't think a creator

261
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,100
can logically grasp that often.

262
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,540
On top of that, the swarm of people who suddenly became interested in the topic seemed to dilute

263
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:05,360
those who actually knew Etika, thus creating a lack of perspective.

264
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,280
The response to Etika's behaviour ultimately became a spike, much reflecting the incidents

265
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,660
themselves, thus not really allowing people to look at his behaviour in between.

266
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,060
To add, there wasn't really anyone that close to him providing an unbiased perspective on

267
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,840
the mental well-being of Etika.

268
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,040
The greatest voice appeared to be Etika's ex-girlfriend, Alice Pika, who Etika was in

269
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,000
a relationship with between 2011 and 2017, however even then this did not seem to be

270
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
enough.

271
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,140
As an ex, Pika can only put herself through so much as well.

272
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,780
Even all the emotional baggage from a six-year relationship existing.

273
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,220
That can't be pleasant, I understand that.

274
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,860
In the months following, Etika apologised for his behaviour and seemingly returned to

275
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,920
his normal self, thus giving many a false sense of security regarding his mental stability.

276
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,820
As many people will tell you, just because someone may appear to seem stable, this doesn't

277
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,220
mean that they are, and an initial episode can often just be foreshadowing for what might

278
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,220
come after.

279
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,260
Ultimately, the difference between Etika and Fusi's episode is that what Etika did directly

280
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,260
harmed himself.

281
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,300
I'd much more compare his behaviour to that of Marina Joyce.

282
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,440
The difference is that at the time of the incident, Marina Joyce seemed completely void

283
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,660
of any motive for intention, and therefore it made people much more inclined to focus

284
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,660
on the issue.

285
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,180
Now don't get me wrong, there were people who didn't believe her either, but the difference

286
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,820
was that after her episode, she didn't return to the public spotlight in a way that Etika

287
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,820
did.

288
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,260
This leads us to the next issue, repetition.

289
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,960
People don't like the same things happening again and again, it is a classic rule of life.

290
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,400
As mentioned earlier, the story of The Boy Who Cried Wolf is a classic tale, but it's

291
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,840
not necessarily accurate in this instance, because we know now that the first time that

292
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,900
Etika cried wolf, the wolf was very much existent, but ultimately that tale shows that if people

293
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:51,040
cannot directly see the wolf, there is no guarantee that they will believe the word

294
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,280
of the individual who claims they saw it.

295
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,120
The worst thing about mental health is that many of the issues are completely invisible

296
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,860
for those who judge a situation, and therefore when they return again, people, although more

297
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,740
likely to doubt it, don't necessarily have any actual proof that they didn't exist, which

298
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,060
leads to a lot of speculation.

299
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,120
During his second breakdown, he was transported to hospital.

300
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,340
In a way, this should have provided verification to the fact that he was not well, however

301
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:20,740
he returned home surprisingly quickly and posted a printout of his medical report to

302
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,740
the internet.

303
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,480
Now the fact that he doxxed himself was once again rather concerning, but the experts in

304
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,680
this instance had concluded that he suffered from agitation.

305
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,780
The appeal to this authority with what appeared to be a rather mild diagnosis appeared to

306
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,120
add credence to the theory that this was just some elaborate ruse.

307
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,720
The only other authority at that time, Alice Pika, was blocked, and although understandably

308
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,800
upset and frustrated at how she had been treated by someone she was trying to help, clumsily

309
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,560
tweeted out that he would not hurt himself.

310
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,160
Probably not the best thing to say, although like many, I'm sure she didn't realise the

311
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,720
consequences at the time.

312
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,200
As the incidents escalated, many people began to realise a ruse this was not, particularly

313
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,560
when it reached the point that he attacked a police officer, however some of the doubts

314
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,700
still lingered, not assisted by the fact that Etika had made somewhat facetious comments

315
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,240
and set up an OnlyFans page on the back of one of his breakdowns, a paid subscription

316
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,240
service.

317
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,040
Even up to the day that he committed suicide, there were people who theorised that this

318
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,480
was not legitimate, but it was, and now we are here.

319
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,200
I think the problem is that people overlook that whatever Etika stood to vaguely gain

320
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,280
from these situations was not sustainable, physically or mentally.

321
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,040
He had already lost a lot, pushed away a lot of his friends, and taken himself to a

322
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,360
stage of public reputation that was so, so far from where he was.

323
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,400
The seemingly very mixed nature of public response made people highly hesitant to take

324
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,600
any action at all, the lack of people close to him speaking out or taking action meant

325
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,680
that he was left alone or vulnerable, and the failure of authority to take him in and

326
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,680
treat him at a time of vulnerability had left him exposed to the very mixed nature of the

327
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,760
internet, and although there were many people who took these things seriously, there were

328
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,100
numbers who prevented a consensus from being created on the right thing to do.

329
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,920
Maybe someone would have been able to intercept this if the outcry was loud enough, but it

330
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,160
never was, and when we were faced down with the implications of not being able to prevent

331
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,400
something that could have been apprehended, many people turned to point fingers at people

332
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,540
who had instigated this environment.

333
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,080
But how accountable are they?

334
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,640
Let's discuss.

335
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,300
People like to doubt.

336
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,580
It's a problem, and one that surfaced in this situation.

337
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:29,320
As mentioned at the start of the video, one of the sides of mental health that we have

338
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,820
a greater understanding of is that it can alter the way we might judge a person, particularly

339
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:38,260
on the basis of their actions, however, some people don't identify it this way.

340
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,700
One of those people was Keemstar.

341
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,240
In what I think is now a deleted video, which I wish I could find, Keemstar states that

342
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,860
he acknowledges that chemical imbalances exist, but doesn't believe that implies mental illness.

343
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,900
This is a statement that is echoed throughout many of his other tweets, though he has since

344
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,500
deleted a lot of them.

345
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,200
Now, many people did not understand this take at all, but I almost have a twisted sense

346
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,500
of comprehension of what he's saying here, albeit clumsily.

347
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,220
He understands that there are certain people with chemical imbalances in their head to

348
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:13,300
a greater degree, however, does not believe this premises the classification of a mental illness.

349
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,700
Let's go into deep philosophy, and I'll try not to lose you.

350
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,420
Essentially, what Keemstar is saying is that different people are different, and that these

351
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:25,260
differences, even ones that seem to make people a bit seemingly insane, are not differences

352
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:29,980
that necessarily provide them with illnesses that might devolve them of responsibility.

353
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,740
At the heart of this issue, every single person will be slightly different in the way that

354
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:37,180
they behave, and the biochemical roots that drive the behaviour.

355
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:41,740
No two people are completely the same, and we can't necessarily account for the disadvantages

356
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,620
that those differences may provoke.

357
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,580
At the end of the day, these differences will lead us down different paths, and no one will

358
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,300
ever be 100% compatible with the environment around them.

359
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:56,260
For many people, the question is when the line between personal accountability and accountability

360
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,420
to a mental illness may be drawn.

361
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,980
It's a difficult question.

362
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:04,420
Without the existence of mental illness, that line is discarded, thus leading to some more

363
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,300
rather interesting discussions.

364
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,600
As spoke about earlier regarding the definition of mental illness, we stated that it was something

365
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,060
that impairs an individual from functioning in their personal life, or causes significant

366
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,060
distress.

367
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,560
In the modern world, that is particularly hard to define, and we won't get it right

368
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,560
every time.

369
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:25,200
But ultimately, the sort of theory that Keemstar promotes only tends to work if mental wellbeing

370
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,620
existed on a fairly even playing field.

371
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,180
The problem is that ultimately, those who may be mentally suffering, or going through

372
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,880
hard times in their head, are typically deviations from an ideal norm.

373
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,040
Now, it's important to clarify what's being said here, because social norms do evolve

374
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,960
and change, and to suggest a deviation may immediately qualify it as a mental illness

375
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
is rather aggressive.

376
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,620
But the thing is that a lot of these deviations seem a lot more scientifically based than

377
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,700
socially brought forward on their own.

378
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,700
And that's the thing.

379
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:19,000
While there is great debate over where the line should be drawn, many of us accept the

380
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
extremes.

381
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,820
It is clear that Etika was on this extreme, and therefore shouldn't have been entertained

382
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,520
in the same way that we might entertain a FouseyTube character.

383
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,580
Many people alleged that Keemstar's promotion of this opinion ultimately weighted him with

384
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,940
some accountability of the situation.

385
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:40,200
He had invited Etika onto his show, which had led him to a rather volatile confrontation.

386
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,620
Many people saw the mentality Keemstar promoted as warring, because it would lead you to treat

387
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:49,440
a mentally ill person with the same level of tact that you would treat a mentally well

388
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,920
person, and when that treatment's coming from Keemstar, well, he's not known for his gentility.

389
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:28,900
Keemstar

390
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,240
also famously made this comment.

391
00:23:40,200 --> 00:24:03,220
Many commentators cited this as a reason for why he should be held to a standard for this

392
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,920
instant, and to be frank, I completely understand why.

393
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:11,540
It was extremely distasteful, especially with the context we now understand, but it's

394
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:15,780
difficult to see that Keemstar was actively encouraging the behaviour, it was more over

395
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:20,500
an abrupt response that was very, very poorly thought out.

396
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:25,620
But still, if you have someone in a high up position in a public community, would you

397
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,900
not expect them to behave with a bit more tact?

398
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,160
Well, yes, but no.

399
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:37,140
The media's exploitation of mental health has long existed prior to Keemstar, in a way

400
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,600
he was terrible, but although many people have argued that he enabled Etika's arguably

401
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,600
very destructive behaviour, it's important to remember the people who enabled Keemstar's

402
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,480
behaviour to the sort of approach that people enjoy, this sensationalisation from this media

403
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,480
figure.

404
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,200
If no one wanted Keemstar's coverage, then he wouldn't have pulled as many views in.

405
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,880
There weren't enough people stepping in and stating that this was literally the worst

406
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,120
way to go about it, and in a way, it would have been hard for people to do that without

407
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,960
the foresight of what would happen.

408
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,620
Now you could argue that Keemstar should have had that foresight, I agree, but he didn't,

409
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:15,460
because the lingering doubt held by many people that this was not legitimate, and simply because

410
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:20,480
Keemstar is no better in many ways, there wasn't an acknowledgement that the consequences

411
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,200
could have turned out this way.

412
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,560
On top of this, you can't really definitively say that if Keemstar and others alike hadn't

413
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,360
publicly mishandled this, Etika would have been absolutely fine.

414
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,940
Keemstar's interview was insensitive and messy, but I highly doubt it would have altered

415
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,940
too much.

416
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,460
I mentioned the Marina Joyce situation earlier, and when that situation transpired she appeared

417
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,760
on an interview with DeFranco, a seemingly more professional news source for sure, but

418
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,400
still with the providence of coverage and traffic nonetheless.

419
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,360
Keemstar's interview, although bad, is much more a symptom rather than a cause.

420
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,040
Ultimately, the difference was that there was just a lack of intervention from many

421
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,120
people, and those who did attempt to intervene weren't close enough to break through.

422
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,240
And honestly, I think the medical authority have come away with a lot less criticism than

423
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,040
they could be receiving, because they should have stepped in themselves, but they just

424
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,880
sent him back home under the impression that it was just a bit of agitation.

425
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,540
To my knowledge, they did not monitor him, despite his continuous public displays towards

426
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,940
himself and others.

427
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:23,460
It worries me to think how someone who's not a public figure like Etika would be treated.

428
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:28,100
And listen, Etika did undergo therapy after his first incident, and was clearly having

429
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:32,420
some sort of help, but I really think more could have been done on the side of professionals

430
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,420
with his initial incident in mind, because regardless of the environment online that

431
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:41,980
it is incredibly toxic and deserving of its own criticism, online people are not expert

432
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,980
therapists.

433
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:48,180
A lot of people, at least, we could all do a bit better from being a tad more compassionate,

434
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:52,980
I do not know if I could honestly blame any online individual for the way this situation

435
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:57,220
has transpired, because the handling was just a reapplied template.

436
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:01,180
No one really went out of their way to approach it differently, it's just for the first time

437
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:05,620
the outcome was very different, and people couldn't begin to rationalise why, so the

438
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:10,220
fingers started being pointed, when really it was a collective problem that the presence

439
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,920
of some and the absence of others contributed to.

440
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,020
Let's talk about that.

441
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:26,740
In Etika's final video, he re-treads the experiences he went through from a rather

442
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,100
solemn perspective.

443
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:36,540
I'm sorry yo, I'm sorry I betrayed your trust, I'm sorry I pushed you all away, I'm sorry

444
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:44,220
I made a clown of myself, I apologise, I wish it didn't have to be this way.

445
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:49,420
When Etika posted indecent content on YouTube, and lost so much that he had worked for, it

446
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:53,220
was a strange scenario that could have been handled very differently.

447
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:58,740
It was the beginning of a long track to the end, and it brought up a very difficult topic.

448
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:03,820
YouTube removed Etika's final video altogether, and this provoked many people to criticise

449
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,820
YouTube.

450
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:09,060
Many people have additionally called on YouTube to restore Etika's original channel, and for

451
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,580
what it's worth, I'd like to echo those calls.

452
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,780
I don't know how practically viable it is, but I think it's important to remember people

453
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:19,500
for what they should be remembered for, and regardless of what has happened over the last

454
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,500
year to Etika, the content that he brought to the website should always outweigh his

455
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,660
untimely passing, and I think YouTube should pay tribute to that.

456
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:31,340
YouTube may terminate or place sanctions on a channel for a multitude of reasons, but

457
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,980
for this situation, it seemed protective to make sure that an incident like that doesn't

458
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,980
occur again.

459
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:41,220
Etika himself was not someone with predatory intent, and still owned other channels on

460
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,220
the website.

461
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,180
With the owner of the channel no longer with us, it is quite clear that the incumbent threat

462
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:50,900
has ceased to be, and therefore it would be appropriate to, in my opinion, return the

463
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,520
channel, for friends, family, and fans alike.

464
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,460
With that out of the way, should they have ever terminated at all, if he was just going

465
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,060
through a mentally vulnerable episode?

466
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,460
In his video, something he said struck me.

467
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,740
But I ultimately turned down help.

468
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:37,260
And you know what they say, you can't help somebody who doesn't want to help themselves.

469
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,220
I just didn't realize I needed help.

470
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,140
That's how deluded I was, man.

471
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,140
It's not y'all fault.

472
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,940
I don't want you to blame yourselves.

473
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,100
It's all my fault.

474
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,860
I'm the one that pushed y'all away.

475
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:57,620
Then I deluded myself into thinking that somehow I didn't destroy a big part of my life, that

476
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,380
somehow I was ahead of the curve.

477
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,580
It was like that heavy delusion that I couldn't pull myself out of.

478
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,780
I didn't even know I was in it.

479
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,240
I was saying and doing things that made no sense.

480
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,740
The way he framed the situation was interesting, because although he takes some responsibility

481
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:16,700
for what had occurred, it almost felt like he perceived himself as having no other option

482
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,460
given the response to the other instance.

483
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:24,180
That was what I found so sad while watching the video, the idea that he perceived himself

484
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,220
as in a corner.

485
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:28,100
The only other option was to take his own life.

486
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,520
Whatever had provoked that shouldn't have occurred, and although there will be some

487
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,940
people who you will never be able to talk out of, I feel that Etika wasn't one of those

488
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,940
people.

489
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:40,580
I think he would have taken an outstretched hand if he felt it was right for him, but

490
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:45,340
in his time of vulnerability, many judged him and the authorities punished him, when

491
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:50,420
really he maybe should have just got his channel back and been monitored a bit more closely.

492
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:54,780
YouTube makes exceptions for people all the time, where they otherwise shouldn't, and

493
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,980
although you don't want to open the floodgates for people abusing the conditions, I just

494
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:03,040
don't feel like it would have, even if I don't have a crystal ball.

495
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,900
The point that I stated in brief light of this is that ultimately, whether completely

496
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:11,740
real or completely fake, the solution doesn't differ too much from an outsider's perspective,

497
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:15,860
but what we need to do is focus on people getting help from offline sources.

498
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:19,660
If someone has been driven to the point that they simulate a mental illness, then they

499
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:23,420
probably need a break and they're still likely suffering from something else.

500
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,860
If they're real, then there should be no question about the course of action.

501
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,700
This isn't to say we shouldn't have a discussion about this stuff and the consequences that

502
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,700
they may yield.

503
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,300
There are people who do abuse mental illness as scapegoats sometimes.

504
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,280
I've spoken about individuals who may be mentally vulnerable.

505
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:42,220
It doesn't necessarily put a person above criticism, but it's equally important the

506
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:46,340
sort of criticism that you'll be dealing out, and the sort of mentality that you promote

507
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,780
towards a person.

508
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:53,940
Let my story be one that advises caution on too much of the social media shit, man.

509
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,980
It can fuck you up.

510
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:02,060
It can give you an image of what you want your life to be, and it can get blown completely

511
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,820
out of proportion, dog.

512
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:13,500
Unfortunately, it consumed me, and it made me forget about consequences to my actions.

513
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,660
It made me forget that we have to pay for the things that we say.

514
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:20,580
It made me forget that there is weight behind words.

515
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,860
I was so consumed with this great image that I had had that I thought I was invulnerable

516
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,860
to everything.

517
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:29,460
As an example, Edgar said a lot of highly inflammatory things during his second mental

518
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:34,240
breakdown, and many people took the opportunity to write him off, it seems, due to the rigidity

519
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,380
of some people's moral compasses.

520
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:41,260
This doesn't validate any of what he said as remotely true or appropriate, and as separate

521
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:45,460
actions they could well be criticised, but they did not warrant people suddenly judging

522
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:49,480
a character that was clearly not completely present to think through their actions.

523
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,360
We have to be very careful when we assign a rigid moral value to certain actions that

524
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:59,660
discount mental state, because you will marginalise people who are suffering and mentally vulnerable,

525
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,120
and I know some people don't want to do that because they don't want certain things

526
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,100
to be quote humanised, but they are human, and when they're coming out of someone who

527
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:11,600
is losing their mind, it's not going to be from the perception of glorification that

528
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,460
you might criticise others for.

529
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:17,840
Let me make it clear, there are many reasons for why people might be pissed off, dangerous

530
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,060
behaviour shouldn't just be ignored, and it definitely shouldn't be encouraged, but

531
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:26,660
it felt like a lot of people used the doubt of legitimacy to write off whatever he was

532
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:31,420
going through, and give license to rather harsh judgement that he clearly felt.

533
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:35,780
He felt that he couldn't come back from this, and we should never make someone feel

534
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,780
like that.

535
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:40,860
We should never make someone like him feel like they can't have a second chance, because

536
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,980
I do think Edgar deserved it.

537
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:47,700
On top of this, although the online culture did come across as disappointingly unsympathetic,

538
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,140
it wasn't the sole cause.

539
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,560
It's not just the mob alone that will fully drive someone to insanity, it often requires

540
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:58,220
a lack of support from all corners, and you've got the feeling that Edgar just seems so alone

541
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:02,380
when he probably needed support most, and pushed many people away.

542
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:07,400
This isn't to say that there isn't an obligation on anyone to do more, maybe that was how Edgar

543
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:12,140
set himself up, and most people just didn't anticipate it, but it should always serve

544
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:16,300
as a reminder that if you have someone in your life that you care about, that you do

545
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:20,140
genuinely value, make sure you let them know from time to time.

546
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:25,180
At the end of the day, what we witness publicly is only the tip of a very deep iceberg, and

547
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:28,940
to judge the person from the situation alone is to miss the point.

548
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:33,020
However, it was something that many people did, maybe even something that I did when

549
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:37,420
I took a passing glance, but I think the best thing we can do is try and be more mindful

550
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,460
in the future of what might happen.

551
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:43,860
There'll be no way to fully prevent these things, and internet trolls will always exist,

552
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:48,300
but if we can have at least a few people re-evaluate the sort of statements they make, then we

553
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,820
might do a bit better.

554
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:53,740
As said at the start, I think this was the first time a community suffered something

555
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:59,500
so intimate to many people, and you can see it all over the site, but we learn, we grow,

556
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,560
and I hope next time we can do a bit better.

557
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,020
When people act like they are mentally suffering, it puts them in a position that isn't inherently

558
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,020
desirable.

559
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:11,460
Although I can understand why some people may think that such behaviour is baiting for

560
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,220
attention or sympathy, and I can understand why people may want to see who's telling

561
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:19,220
the truth and who isn't, because we want to be putting the right energy into the right

562
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:23,660
people, we still have to do it with sensitivity, and with the knowledge that we might be wrong.

563
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:27,580
Also, regardless of whether you believe mental illness to be real or not, the result of this

564
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:32,500
situation was from a specific mindset that does deserve exception in its treatment.

565
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,180
Whether that's due to society or not is another question, but unless you're planning

566
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:40,820
on being the person to uproot society, then you should probably play the game with caution.

567
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:45,260
I don't think you can hold a single individual accountable for the death of Etika, I think

568
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:49,500
it was a collective failure due to a limited perspective, though really, I wish someone

569
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,440
had just stepped in at the right time, and that's a reminder, if you have the power

570
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,700
to step in, then don't shy away, you really don't know the difference it might make.

571
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,580
As always with this sort of video, I'll leave links below to suicide hotlines, this

572
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:07,020
video will not be monetised, because I feel it's a situation that is bigger than all

573
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:11,480
of us, some people did suggest I monetise it and give the ad sense to charity, but I

574
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,540
feel that would just cause confusion, and it'd likely be demonetised anyway, there'll

575
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:20,920
be some links to reputable suicide charities below if you want to donate.

576
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,780
Take care of yourself, people.

577
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:29,700
So yes, that's the video, I want to give a thanks to my editors once again for their

578
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:34,500
work, I know that this is probably a situation close to many of their hearts, and I'm gonna

579
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,500
leave their links in the pinned comment, go and check them out, send them some love, because

580
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,500
I'm sure this was not an easy one for them.

581
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:45,660
I'd also like to give a big thanks to my Patreons, thank you for supporting me so much, it makes

582
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:49,740
a hell of a lot of difference, particularly when dealing with these topics, some of those

583
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:55,980
Patreons are up on screen right now, I'd like to give a big thanks to two specific Patreons,

584
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:03,140

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,660
else to add, but just take care guys, and I do love you, appreciate you a lot, I'm The
