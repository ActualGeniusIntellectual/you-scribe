00:00.000 --> 00:12.720
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with

00:12.720 --> 00:17.240
too much free time, and I have made a lot of videos in my time about sensitive topics.

00:17.240 --> 00:20.520
In fact, I think it's important to discuss sensitive topics because often they are the

00:20.520 --> 00:24.480
ones where they might be the most at stake, particularly situations that involve sensitive

00:24.480 --> 00:25.480
individuals.

00:25.480 --> 00:29.120
However, on the other hand, it is completely understandable why some people do not want

00:29.120 --> 00:32.400
to talk about these things, because they may not feel comfortable enough to do the

00:32.400 --> 00:35.840
topic justice, or you might just feel it would be inappropriate.

00:35.840 --> 00:39.520
I'm not one of those people, I'm sure everyone has received that impression now, I think

00:39.520 --> 00:43.140
as long as you're bringing some level of discourse to the subject, there is nothing that should

00:43.140 --> 00:44.440
be holding you back.

00:44.440 --> 00:48.360
However, today's subject I feel is something that is honestly bigger than anything I've

00:48.360 --> 00:52.300
covered in the past, and there's no real way to get around that, so I will try to keep

00:52.300 --> 00:55.800
my regular structure, but honestly, it's one of those things where I'm also going to have

00:55.800 --> 00:57.600
to let the topic guide me.

00:57.600 --> 00:58.960
Let's talk about Etika then.

00:58.960 --> 01:03.280
Etika born Desmond Daniel Amifer was a YouTube slash streamer from New York.

01:03.280 --> 01:08.880
He started YouTube in 2012 under the brand of Etika World Network, abbreviated to EW

01:08.880 --> 01:09.880
Network.

01:09.880 --> 01:13.920
Over the years, he gradually built up a mandate of content, covering various topics.

01:13.920 --> 01:17.720
It was certainly a bit more gaming oriented, but there was a lot of variety in what he

01:17.720 --> 01:18.880
chose to cover.

01:18.880 --> 01:23.440
This was because he was such a personality, and clearly had a lot of passion for everything

01:23.440 --> 01:27.940
he spoke about, and being consistently invested in what you're talking about is a quality

01:27.940 --> 01:29.740
rarer than many assume.

01:29.740 --> 01:34.500
Over the seven years on YouTube, he developed a following of around 800,000 subscribers,

01:34.500 --> 01:38.740
with a significant amount of these coming throughout the 2017-18 period.

01:38.740 --> 01:42.940
I can't really say too much about him myself because I wasn't too familiar with him, and

01:42.940 --> 01:47.060
it would be disingenuous to pretend I was, however, just as a side note, it would be

01:47.060 --> 01:51.760
really interesting to see someone do a more tribute style retrospective on him.

01:51.760 --> 01:54.940
So what was it about this topic that appealed to me?

01:54.940 --> 01:59.980
Towards the end of 2018, in the midst of a highly successful run, Etika's channel was

01:59.980 --> 02:00.980
deleted.

02:00.980 --> 02:04.620
However, this was not the typical YouTube termination where some untrained bot made

02:04.620 --> 02:08.860
a decision because someone spoke about a sensitive topic, and it thought the video was flat earth

02:08.860 --> 02:09.860
propaganda.

02:09.860 --> 02:14.220
No, this was what appeared to be a fairly justified decision, as pornographic content

02:14.220 --> 02:17.060
appeared to have been posted onto Etika's channel.

02:17.060 --> 02:20.820
Following this, he then took to social media, where he posted multiple statements that seemed

02:20.820 --> 02:22.180
to allude to suicide.

02:22.180 --> 02:26.520
This is where I first heard about him, because when a large influencer with a lot of reputational

02:26.520 --> 02:30.540
clout posts about suicide, it will rightfully cause concern within the community.

02:30.540 --> 02:35.100
However, not too long after this, he responded to the concern, clarifying that he was okay,

02:35.100 --> 02:37.820
and apologising for the panic that he may have caused.

02:37.820 --> 02:42.220
Alright, so, situation over, we can all get back to our day jobs and sleep at night knowing

02:42.220 --> 02:44.500
that Etika is absolutely fine.

02:44.500 --> 02:48.500
Well, not quite, because Desmond wasn't as okay as he claimed to be.

02:48.500 --> 02:52.380
However, these issues did not resurface until April 2019.

02:52.380 --> 02:55.940
When the suicidal tendencies returned, he threatened to delete Twitter and had some

02:55.940 --> 02:59.360
interesting comments for those who tried to confront him regarding this.

02:59.360 --> 03:02.100
This then led to his arrest and hospitalisation.

03:02.100 --> 03:05.620
Less than a couple weeks after this was followed by an unusual shift in which he appeared to

03:05.620 --> 03:09.900
be under the impression that he was a god, yes, a celestial being that had transcended

03:09.900 --> 03:13.340
humankind and was in complete control of their surroundings.

03:13.340 --> 03:17.420
He posted an array of offensive content and subsequently blocked close friends who reached

03:17.420 --> 03:18.420
out to him.

03:18.420 --> 03:22.220
He was then detained by the police in which he informed everyone that the revolution would

03:22.220 --> 03:23.700
not be televised.

03:23.700 --> 03:27.560
He was released from hospital shortly after, at which point he posted the diagnosis which

03:27.560 --> 03:29.380
included his full docs.

03:29.380 --> 03:33.880
Another video then appeared showing him assaulting a police officer and being arrested again.

03:33.880 --> 03:37.020
Throughout this, he had multiple back and forths with Drama Alert host and Internet

03:37.020 --> 03:38.480
personality Keemstar.

03:38.480 --> 03:42.900
This eventually led him to go on the show for an interview where it became pretty interesting.

03:42.900 --> 03:44.740
Hey guys, what's going on?

03:44.740 --> 03:45.740
It's me, the Antichrist.

03:45.740 --> 03:49.320
I've come to purge the planet of all human life.

03:49.320 --> 03:53.980
I will be dropping nuclear missiles very, very soon on every single human being.

03:53.980 --> 03:55.060
Death means nothing.

03:55.060 --> 03:57.440
Why are you all so scared of death for?

03:57.440 --> 04:00.120
It means absolutely zero in the interim.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.980
Why do you think I made Trump president?

04:01.980 --> 04:04.180
We're about to get some fireworks real soon.

04:04.180 --> 04:05.820
This is this is what I'm asking.

04:05.820 --> 04:08.180
Was this a publicity stunt?

04:08.180 --> 04:10.380
Oh, this is my world.

04:10.380 --> 04:12.380
You are playing in my game.

04:12.380 --> 04:13.840
This is all me.

04:13.840 --> 04:16.440
Stop thinking so small, dreamy, creamy, creamy.

04:16.440 --> 04:17.440
Shut up.

04:17.440 --> 04:18.440
Wait, what kind of salad?

04:18.440 --> 04:21.280
Do you have kale and spinach in that salad?

04:21.280 --> 04:22.280
Mostly kale.

04:22.280 --> 04:23.280
You have superfoods in that salad?

04:23.280 --> 04:24.280
Mostly kale.

04:24.280 --> 04:25.280
Oh, really?

04:25.280 --> 04:26.280
I take a lot of vitamins.

04:26.280 --> 04:27.280
You have to.

04:27.280 --> 04:29.760
My mind has to be on top of its game.

04:29.760 --> 04:30.760
Why are you fat?

04:30.760 --> 04:34.800
The multiple changes in Etika's personality compared with other reasons that we'll discuss

04:34.800 --> 04:38.880
relatively soon had really created a fork in the internet regarding the cause of the

04:38.880 --> 04:40.880
mentality that he had adopted.

04:40.880 --> 04:45.120
Some asserted that this was all a simulation, others believed some of his actions were very

04:45.120 --> 04:48.440
real and that no man in his position would merely make this up.

04:48.440 --> 04:52.480
However, although many people were justifiably concerned for his well-being, few could foresee

04:52.480 --> 04:54.120
what was about to happen.

04:54.120 --> 04:59.960
After some more escapades, on June the 19th, Etika posted a video titled I'm sorry to YouTube.

04:59.960 --> 05:04.400
In the video, he lays out his thought process and how it has led him to his current predicament.

05:04.400 --> 05:08.400
Even without the knowledge that this would ultimately be his last upload, it's a pretty

05:08.400 --> 05:09.900
tough video to sit through.

05:09.900 --> 05:14.040
He seems extremely remorseful and addresses a lot of his recent ventures with a level

05:14.040 --> 05:16.060
of reflection not previously seen.

05:16.060 --> 05:19.420
He states that he had been suffering from mental health issues, and his language implies

05:19.420 --> 05:21.440
that he was planning on taking his own life.

05:21.440 --> 05:25.580
He was reported missing on the 20th, and a bag with his belongings was found by the Manhattan

05:25.580 --> 05:26.580
Bridge.

05:26.580 --> 05:28.020
It was not looking too good.

05:28.020 --> 05:32.220
People's worst fears were confirmed on the 24th of July when a body was recovered, and

05:32.220 --> 05:34.900
by the 25th, it was confirmed to be Etika.

05:34.900 --> 05:38.300
Even with the anticipation, the shock was immediate and felt by many.

05:38.300 --> 05:42.480
It is clear that a large number of individuals saw themselves as having a very close relationship

05:42.480 --> 05:46.580
with the streamer, even audiences who had merely casually viewed his content were visibly

05:46.580 --> 05:47.580
shaken.

05:47.580 --> 05:51.100
Etika isn't the first YouTuber to take his own life, but few had ever seen a person's

05:51.100 --> 05:53.740
mental state unravel in front of their eyes.

05:53.740 --> 05:58.300
This sparked a new discussion on how the online world and platforms treat mental health, with

05:58.300 --> 06:02.860
many people pointing fingers at figures who had enabled his seemingly destructive actions.

06:02.860 --> 06:06.360
In spite of the thoughts and prayers type mourning, there was an equal amount of visceral

06:06.360 --> 06:10.780
passion in many people's feelings, feelings that were justified in many ways, but ultimately

06:10.780 --> 06:13.880
overlooked a behaviour symptomatic of the culture.

06:13.880 --> 06:17.480
One of the greatest issues was that people just didn't know how to react to someone like

06:17.480 --> 06:21.400
Etika going off the rails, and others who didn't believe it was real at all.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.520
Today, I intend to investigate and discuss that behaviour.

06:24.520 --> 06:27.880
It's a hard one, I'm aware, and I do warn people in advance that we'll be dealing with

06:27.880 --> 06:29.080
sensitive topics.

06:29.080 --> 06:33.000
The main point I want to discuss is to what extent this was avoidable, and what can be

06:33.000 --> 06:35.460
done in future scenarios to avoid this.

06:35.460 --> 06:46.580
Let's begin this topic with a little history.

06:46.580 --> 06:50.540
YouTube and international media has a complicated relationship with mental wellbeing.

06:50.540 --> 06:54.300
On one hand, the increasing awareness for certain conditions has definitely aided people

06:54.300 --> 06:55.500
in diagnoses.

06:55.500 --> 06:59.820
In the past, and still in some places today, there has been a stigma around being mentally

06:59.820 --> 07:00.820
ill.

07:00.820 --> 07:04.240
Go back less than a hundred years ago, and even in many Western countries, the best way

07:04.240 --> 07:07.920
to deal with someone who may be suffering from mental issues were straitjackets and

07:07.920 --> 07:08.920
lobotomies.

07:08.920 --> 07:13.700
However, many countries quickly realised, hey, this might not be such a grand idea,

07:13.700 --> 07:18.520
and throughout the 20th century, many sweeping reforms took place that humanised and categorised

07:18.520 --> 07:20.720
the conditions that many people suffered from.

07:20.720 --> 07:26.340
In the UK, it wasn't until 1961 that all the asylums were closed by the then Health Minister

07:26.340 --> 07:30.880
Enoch Powell, who might ring a bell for British viewers for slightly less positive reasons.

07:30.880 --> 07:34.580
However, in the decades following, there were still a lot of issues regarding public

07:34.580 --> 07:39.080
perception of mentally ill individuals, because as many people know, even if you change the

07:39.080 --> 07:43.800
laws, many of the stereotypes around these individuals still remain, often perpetuated

07:43.800 --> 07:45.720
by communities and the media.

07:45.720 --> 07:49.680
It has certainly taken a long time for a lot of people to have their perceptions shifted,

07:49.680 --> 07:51.200
but we are making progress.

07:51.200 --> 07:54.200
However, when one problem goes away, another arises.

07:54.200 --> 07:59.560
In fact, a plethora of them decide to materialise, all ingrained in modern culture, with the

07:59.560 --> 08:03.760
increasing nuance surrounding mental disorders no longer was it perceived as this sort of

08:03.760 --> 08:05.720
rabid person in a straight jacket.

08:05.720 --> 08:10.080
We move towards trying to define the many shades, typically from a psychological perspective,

08:10.080 --> 08:14.800
a mental disorder is something that impairs an individual from functioning in their personal

08:14.800 --> 08:17.120
life, or causes significant distress.

08:17.120 --> 08:22.100
Nowadays, instead of throwing people who may be mentally ill in an asylum, we try and account

08:22.100 --> 08:26.160
for their personal illness in their behaviour, we try and treat it, we try and help them

08:26.160 --> 08:27.320
improve.

08:27.320 --> 08:32.280
People with mental illnesses are at a disadvantage, and we do like to help people, however at

08:32.280 --> 08:36.380
the same time we only have limited energy and resources to help people, and we don't

08:36.380 --> 08:40.640
like people exploiting mental illness, whether it's for money or for sympathy.

08:40.640 --> 08:45.420
On top of this, a mental disorder does imply that an individual may not be fully responsible

08:45.420 --> 08:49.820
for their actions, for example, it is regularly used as a defence in court, which might result

08:49.820 --> 08:52.100
in a reduced sentence or a referral.

08:52.100 --> 08:56.520
This has ultimately caused a lot of controversy, because actions and consequences would always

08:56.520 --> 09:01.400
exist separate of the person conducting them, and many people have trouble finding justification

09:01.400 --> 09:03.180
sometimes for people's actions.

09:03.180 --> 09:07.320
On top of this, people know that a person's character isn't defined by their mental condition,

09:07.320 --> 09:11.240
and to assume someone did something on the basis of mental illness alone might well be

09:11.240 --> 09:14.660
a great disservice to other people going through the same thing.

09:14.660 --> 09:19.160
There are a lot of blurred lines, if someone's a psychopath, they will receive a fairly harsh

09:19.160 --> 09:23.680
sentence for a crime, many would argue rightfully so, but suffering from another disorder may

09:23.680 --> 09:25.880
completely devolve responsibility.

09:25.880 --> 09:29.120
Now there are many rational arguments for why this is, but equally, there are still

09:29.120 --> 09:33.200
a lot of unknowns, and many of us don't quite know how to deal with this, however, because

09:33.200 --> 09:37.180
people don't like blurred lines, and because people like to have opinions, this will lead

09:37.180 --> 09:40.240
to people perhaps judging situations prematurely.

09:40.240 --> 09:43.880
The discussion of mental illness has reared its head on multiple occasions relating to

09:43.880 --> 09:49.080
popular YouTubers and even celebrities, sometimes it is done in a fairly poignant manner, however

09:49.080 --> 09:54.340
on YouTube, a lot of the time, it is not so much, arguably one of the more recent situations

09:54.340 --> 09:58.780
that had allegedly fairly deep ties to mental illness was FouseyTube's quite incredible

09:58.780 --> 10:02.960
public display of what the hell is going on, with the failure that was FouseyCon, and all

10:02.960 --> 10:06.180
subsequent demonstrations that we had the delight of observing.

10:06.180 --> 10:10.820
At the time, there was an ambiguity regarding the role the mental health had played into

10:10.820 --> 10:15.420
it, but there was a shared fixation on the failure that was FouseyCon, and the fact that

10:15.420 --> 10:19.160
he had hyped up the appearance of multiple celebrities and brought people from all over

10:19.160 --> 10:23.580
the country, and even the world, to attend to him basically standing on a car.

10:23.580 --> 10:28.260
As a public figure, many people, myself included, placed a significant amount of responsibility

10:28.260 --> 10:32.980
on him, and many others saw the idea of a mental problem as a scapegoat.

10:32.980 --> 10:37.740
It's understandable, given Fousey's history of lies, deception, and manipulation, particularly

10:37.740 --> 10:38.820
within his pranks.

10:38.820 --> 10:42.620
The people's patience was worn relatively thin by then, equally though, regardless of

10:42.620 --> 10:46.300
whether he was stimulating or not, at the time it received a lot of attention.

10:46.300 --> 10:50.440
Ultimately, the whole stunt seemed to be done for one reason, attention, it felt like a

10:50.440 --> 10:54.880
person going one step further to retain the feeling of attention that he once had.

10:54.880 --> 10:59.280
It was a fairly sad situation, and regardless of the attention given to him in the moment,

10:59.280 --> 11:01.940
these sorts of acts are much alike to crying wolf.

11:01.940 --> 11:06.320
You may gain attention at first, but people will begin to ignore it towards the end, and

11:06.320 --> 11:09.040
like that, Fousey faded into the background.

11:09.040 --> 11:12.820
Now there are many creators who talk about these issues, but prior to Etika, Fousey's

11:12.820 --> 11:17.880
incident was the most recent public demonstration that has sparked debate about mental health's

11:17.880 --> 11:19.480
involvement in accountability.

11:19.520 --> 11:24.160
Ultimately, the conclusion was clear, the sooner the spotlight was off him, the better.

11:24.160 --> 11:27.760
If someone only lives for attention, then they cannot survive, because unless you're

11:27.760 --> 11:32.240
the bloody queen, people can't invest themselves in every single celebrity.

11:32.240 --> 11:34.820
Not everything you do will be interesting.

11:34.820 --> 11:38.600
There are many reasons that people come down harder on public figures, but the main reason

11:38.600 --> 11:43.840
is because many creators and YouTubers make videos for a purpose, attention, but attention

11:43.840 --> 11:46.280
isn't typically given, it's earned.

11:46.280 --> 11:50.440
YouTubers want creators to work hard for their engagement, people can fake being insane,

11:50.440 --> 11:54.240
but many people don't, because they know how it would trivialise the genuine cases

11:54.240 --> 11:55.240
of insanity.

11:55.240 --> 11:59.900
However, this promotes a scarcity in these incidents, so that when they occur, they receive

11:59.900 --> 12:01.620
unconditional attention.

12:01.620 --> 12:06.600
The concept of a mental breakdown is attention in the worst way for many reasons, and therefore

12:06.600 --> 12:10.440
if people think it's faked, then they might feel cheated, they've given their attention

12:10.440 --> 12:14.080
to someone's suffering when they could have given it to someone else who deserved it,

12:14.080 --> 12:18.920
or for the emotional impact that witnessing a person allegedly suffering might cause.

12:18.920 --> 12:23.060
People don't want to be taken for fools, however scepticism can sometimes manifest

12:23.060 --> 12:25.720
and be applied where it probably isn't needed.

12:25.720 --> 12:30.000
Now many people would say that today's situation is one of those instances, after all it's

12:30.000 --> 12:32.560
quite clear that those who doubted him were in the wrong.

12:32.560 --> 12:37.200
However, as always, I want to take a deeper dive and explore what made people think that

12:37.200 --> 12:43.880
way, and if we could try and turn it round in the future.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.040
People exist on a spectrum of scepticism.

12:46.040 --> 12:49.760
When there are claims, there will always be people who are more likely to believe an individual

12:49.760 --> 12:53.880
making those claims, and likely those who will have a higher burden of proof.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.240
Both of these positions are somewhat justifiable.

12:56.240 --> 12:59.600
One of the biggest problems with the Etika situation was that many people seemed to have

12:59.600 --> 13:04.080
presumed positions on the basis of previous incidents and their own opinions.

13:04.080 --> 13:08.040
This has been the product of much of the internet culture that has arisen over the last few

13:08.040 --> 13:12.420
years, the sort of desperation to prove your own side right, but not really stopping to

13:12.420 --> 13:14.540
analyse the actual information.

13:14.540 --> 13:19.060
Let this be clear, this is not against anyone who may have quietly speculated about Etika's

13:19.060 --> 13:20.180
mental health.

13:20.180 --> 13:25.180
People are 100% entitled to those opinions, even if they are proven dubious in the future.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.820
We all have our doubts, and I'm not one to please those.

13:27.820 --> 13:31.100
However, there were many people who pushed ideas that really shouldn't have been the

13:31.100 --> 13:35.480
focus of the situation at the time, nonetheless, they still existed.

13:35.480 --> 13:36.480
Why did they?

13:36.480 --> 13:41.340
Well, let's dissect some of the basic concepts of why people tend to doubt these things.

13:41.340 --> 13:43.340
The first is reputation.

13:43.340 --> 13:47.180
Public figures arguably get one of the worst wraps for mental health, despite the fact

13:47.180 --> 13:49.640
that many times, they are equally as vulnerable.

13:49.640 --> 13:53.180
This is mainly due to the conception that mental health issues typically come from a

13:53.180 --> 13:58.220
lack of material items, such as money or a house, and as mentioned earlier, given creators

13:58.220 --> 14:03.340
and their drive for attention, we are typically hesitant to dish out sympathy in their direction.

14:03.340 --> 14:07.780
When people do certain things that seem like an immediate hunt for attention, people become

14:07.780 --> 14:09.180
immediately sceptical.

14:09.180 --> 14:13.420
In this instance, Etika's provocative moment of posting porn, followed by the numerous

14:13.420 --> 14:17.120
suicidal threats, felt like a moment to shock the audience.

14:17.120 --> 14:21.860
Although in hindsight, given some of his behavioural tics, it may have been foreseeable, many people,

14:21.860 --> 14:26.480
particularly outsiders, saw it as too sudden a turn for it to not have taken some level

14:26.480 --> 14:27.480
of orchestration.

14:27.480 --> 14:32.260
However, the problem is, by focusing on the spikes of attention seeking, people overlook

14:32.260 --> 14:37.380
the other conditions that may not explicitly be stated, but have to be taken into account.

14:37.380 --> 14:42.060
By losing his channel, Etika practically lost six years of accumulated work that he

14:42.060 --> 14:46.140
wasn't going to be able to get back, and alright, some might argue that it was a bombastic

14:46.140 --> 14:50.500
way to torpedo his channel to focus on his other works, but he would have had to have

14:50.500 --> 14:55.060
had a level of certainty that he was never going to return, and I don't think a creator

14:55.060 --> 14:57.100
can logically grasp that often.

14:57.100 --> 15:01.540
On top of that, the swarm of people who suddenly became interested in the topic seemed to dilute

15:01.540 --> 15:05.360
those who actually knew Etika, thus creating a lack of perspective.

15:05.360 --> 15:10.280
The response to Etika's behaviour ultimately became a spike, much reflecting the incidents

15:10.280 --> 15:14.660
themselves, thus not really allowing people to look at his behaviour in between.

15:14.660 --> 15:19.060
To add, there wasn't really anyone that close to him providing an unbiased perspective on

15:19.060 --> 15:20.840
the mental well-being of Etika.

15:20.840 --> 15:25.040
The greatest voice appeared to be Etika's ex-girlfriend, Alice Pika, who Etika was in

15:25.040 --> 15:31.000
a relationship with between 2011 and 2017, however even then this did not seem to be

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
enough.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.140
As an ex, Pika can only put herself through so much as well.

15:35.140 --> 15:38.780
Even all the emotional baggage from a six-year relationship existing.

15:38.780 --> 15:41.220
That can't be pleasant, I understand that.

15:41.220 --> 15:44.860
In the months following, Etika apologised for his behaviour and seemingly returned to

15:44.860 --> 15:49.920
his normal self, thus giving many a false sense of security regarding his mental stability.

15:49.920 --> 15:53.820
As many people will tell you, just because someone may appear to seem stable, this doesn't

15:53.820 --> 15:58.220
mean that they are, and an initial episode can often just be foreshadowing for what might

15:58.220 --> 15:59.220
come after.

15:59.220 --> 16:03.260
Ultimately, the difference between Etika and Fusi's episode is that what Etika did directly

16:03.260 --> 16:04.260
harmed himself.

16:04.260 --> 16:07.300
I'd much more compare his behaviour to that of Marina Joyce.

16:07.300 --> 16:11.440
The difference is that at the time of the incident, Marina Joyce seemed completely void

16:11.440 --> 16:15.660
of any motive for intention, and therefore it made people much more inclined to focus

16:15.660 --> 16:16.660
on the issue.

16:16.660 --> 16:20.180
Now don't get me wrong, there were people who didn't believe her either, but the difference

16:20.180 --> 16:24.820
was that after her episode, she didn't return to the public spotlight in a way that Etika

16:24.820 --> 16:25.820
did.

16:25.820 --> 16:28.260
This leads us to the next issue, repetition.

16:28.260 --> 16:32.960
People don't like the same things happening again and again, it is a classic rule of life.

16:32.960 --> 16:37.400
As mentioned earlier, the story of The Boy Who Cried Wolf is a classic tale, but it's

16:37.400 --> 16:41.840
not necessarily accurate in this instance, because we know now that the first time that

16:41.840 --> 16:46.900
Etika cried wolf, the wolf was very much existent, but ultimately that tale shows that if people

16:46.900 --> 16:51.040
cannot directly see the wolf, there is no guarantee that they will believe the word

16:51.040 --> 16:53.280
of the individual who claims they saw it.

16:53.280 --> 16:57.120
The worst thing about mental health is that many of the issues are completely invisible

16:57.120 --> 17:01.860
for those who judge a situation, and therefore when they return again, people, although more

17:01.860 --> 17:06.740
likely to doubt it, don't necessarily have any actual proof that they didn't exist, which

17:06.740 --> 17:09.060
leads to a lot of speculation.

17:09.060 --> 17:12.120
During his second breakdown, he was transported to hospital.

17:12.120 --> 17:16.340
In a way, this should have provided verification to the fact that he was not well, however

17:16.340 --> 17:20.740
he returned home surprisingly quickly and posted a printout of his medical report to

17:20.740 --> 17:21.740
the internet.

17:21.740 --> 17:25.480
Now the fact that he doxxed himself was once again rather concerning, but the experts in

17:25.480 --> 17:28.680
this instance had concluded that he suffered from agitation.

17:28.680 --> 17:32.780
The appeal to this authority with what appeared to be a rather mild diagnosis appeared to

17:32.780 --> 17:36.120
add credence to the theory that this was just some elaborate ruse.

17:36.120 --> 17:40.720
The only other authority at that time, Alice Pika, was blocked, and although understandably

17:40.720 --> 17:44.800
upset and frustrated at how she had been treated by someone she was trying to help, clumsily

17:44.800 --> 17:47.560
tweeted out that he would not hurt himself.

17:47.560 --> 17:51.160
Probably not the best thing to say, although like many, I'm sure she didn't realise the

17:51.160 --> 17:52.720
consequences at the time.

17:52.720 --> 17:57.200
As the incidents escalated, many people began to realise a ruse this was not, particularly

17:57.200 --> 18:00.560
when it reached the point that he attacked a police officer, however some of the doubts

18:00.560 --> 18:04.700
still lingered, not assisted by the fact that Etika had made somewhat facetious comments

18:04.700 --> 18:09.240
and set up an OnlyFans page on the back of one of his breakdowns, a paid subscription

18:09.240 --> 18:10.240
service.

18:10.240 --> 18:14.040
Even up to the day that he committed suicide, there were people who theorised that this

18:14.040 --> 18:17.480
was not legitimate, but it was, and now we are here.

18:17.480 --> 18:22.200
I think the problem is that people overlook that whatever Etika stood to vaguely gain

18:22.200 --> 18:26.280
from these situations was not sustainable, physically or mentally.

18:26.280 --> 18:30.040
He had already lost a lot, pushed away a lot of his friends, and taken himself to a

18:30.040 --> 18:34.360
stage of public reputation that was so, so far from where he was.

18:34.360 --> 18:38.400
The seemingly very mixed nature of public response made people highly hesitant to take

18:38.400 --> 18:42.600
any action at all, the lack of people close to him speaking out or taking action meant

18:42.600 --> 18:46.680
that he was left alone or vulnerable, and the failure of authority to take him in and

18:46.680 --> 18:51.680
treat him at a time of vulnerability had left him exposed to the very mixed nature of the

18:51.680 --> 18:55.760
internet, and although there were many people who took these things seriously, there were

18:55.760 --> 19:00.100
numbers who prevented a consensus from being created on the right thing to do.

19:00.100 --> 19:03.920
Maybe someone would have been able to intercept this if the outcry was loud enough, but it

19:03.920 --> 19:08.160
never was, and when we were faced down with the implications of not being able to prevent

19:08.160 --> 19:12.400
something that could have been apprehended, many people turned to point fingers at people

19:12.400 --> 19:14.540
who had instigated this environment.

19:14.540 --> 19:17.080
But how accountable are they?

19:17.080 --> 19:20.640
Let's discuss.

19:20.640 --> 19:22.300
People like to doubt.

19:22.300 --> 19:25.580
It's a problem, and one that surfaced in this situation.

19:25.580 --> 19:29.320
As mentioned at the start of the video, one of the sides of mental health that we have

19:29.320 --> 19:33.820
a greater understanding of is that it can alter the way we might judge a person, particularly

19:33.820 --> 19:38.260
on the basis of their actions, however, some people don't identify it this way.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.700
One of those people was Keemstar.

19:40.700 --> 19:45.240
In what I think is now a deleted video, which I wish I could find, Keemstar states that

19:45.240 --> 19:49.860
he acknowledges that chemical imbalances exist, but doesn't believe that implies mental illness.

19:49.860 --> 19:53.900
This is a statement that is echoed throughout many of his other tweets, though he has since

19:53.900 --> 19:55.500
deleted a lot of them.

19:55.500 --> 20:00.200
Now, many people did not understand this take at all, but I almost have a twisted sense

20:00.200 --> 20:03.500
of comprehension of what he's saying here, albeit clumsily.

20:03.500 --> 20:07.220
He understands that there are certain people with chemical imbalances in their head to

20:07.220 --> 20:13.300
a greater degree, however, does not believe this premises the classification of a mental illness.

20:13.300 --> 20:16.700
Let's go into deep philosophy, and I'll try not to lose you.

20:16.700 --> 20:20.420
Essentially, what Keemstar is saying is that different people are different, and that these

20:20.420 --> 20:25.260
differences, even ones that seem to make people a bit seemingly insane, are not differences

20:25.260 --> 20:29.980
that necessarily provide them with illnesses that might devolve them of responsibility.

20:29.980 --> 20:33.740
At the heart of this issue, every single person will be slightly different in the way that

20:33.740 --> 20:37.180
they behave, and the biochemical roots that drive the behaviour.

20:37.180 --> 20:41.740
No two people are completely the same, and we can't necessarily account for the disadvantages

20:41.740 --> 20:43.620
that those differences may provoke.

20:43.620 --> 20:47.580
At the end of the day, these differences will lead us down different paths, and no one will

20:47.580 --> 20:51.300
ever be 100% compatible with the environment around them.

20:51.300 --> 20:56.260
For many people, the question is when the line between personal accountability and accountability

20:56.260 --> 20:58.420
to a mental illness may be drawn.

20:58.420 --> 20:59.980
It's a difficult question.

20:59.980 --> 21:04.420
Without the existence of mental illness, that line is discarded, thus leading to some more

21:04.420 --> 21:06.300
rather interesting discussions.

21:06.300 --> 21:10.600
As spoke about earlier regarding the definition of mental illness, we stated that it was something

21:10.600 --> 21:15.060
that impairs an individual from functioning in their personal life, or causes significant

21:15.060 --> 21:16.060
distress.

21:16.060 --> 21:19.560
In the modern world, that is particularly hard to define, and we won't get it right

21:19.560 --> 21:20.560
every time.

21:20.560 --> 21:25.200
But ultimately, the sort of theory that Keemstar promotes only tends to work if mental wellbeing

21:25.200 --> 21:27.620
existed on a fairly even playing field.

21:27.620 --> 21:31.180
The problem is that ultimately, those who may be mentally suffering, or going through

21:31.180 --> 21:35.880
hard times in their head, are typically deviations from an ideal norm.

21:35.880 --> 21:40.040
Now, it's important to clarify what's being said here, because social norms do evolve

21:40.040 --> 21:44.960
and change, and to suggest a deviation may immediately qualify it as a mental illness

21:44.960 --> 21:45.960
is rather aggressive.

21:45.960 --> 21:50.620
But the thing is that a lot of these deviations seem a lot more scientifically based than

21:50.620 --> 21:52.700
socially brought forward on their own.

22:12.700 --> 22:13.700
And that's the thing.

22:13.700 --> 22:19.000
While there is great debate over where the line should be drawn, many of us accept the

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
extremes.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.820
It is clear that Etika was on this extreme, and therefore shouldn't have been entertained

22:23.820 --> 22:27.520
in the same way that we might entertain a FouseyTube character.

22:27.520 --> 22:31.580
Many people alleged that Keemstar's promotion of this opinion ultimately weighted him with

22:31.580 --> 22:33.940
some accountability of the situation.

22:33.940 --> 22:40.200
He had invited Etika onto his show, which had led him to a rather volatile confrontation.

22:40.200 --> 22:44.620
Many people saw the mentality Keemstar promoted as warring, because it would lead you to treat

22:44.620 --> 22:49.440
a mentally ill person with the same level of tact that you would treat a mentally well

22:49.440 --> 22:53.920
person, and when that treatment's coming from Keemstar, well, he's not known for his gentility.

23:10.200 --> 23:28.900
Keemstar

23:28.900 --> 23:31.240
also famously made this comment.

23:40.200 --> 24:03.220
Many commentators cited this as a reason for why he should be held to a standard for this

24:03.220 --> 24:06.920
instant, and to be frank, I completely understand why.

24:06.920 --> 24:11.540
It was extremely distasteful, especially with the context we now understand, but it's

24:11.540 --> 24:15.780
difficult to see that Keemstar was actively encouraging the behaviour, it was more over

24:15.780 --> 24:20.500
an abrupt response that was very, very poorly thought out.

24:20.500 --> 24:25.620
But still, if you have someone in a high up position in a public community, would you

24:25.620 --> 24:28.900
not expect them to behave with a bit more tact?

24:28.900 --> 24:32.160
Well, yes, but no.

24:32.160 --> 24:37.140
The media's exploitation of mental health has long existed prior to Keemstar, in a way

24:37.140 --> 24:41.600
he was terrible, but although many people have argued that he enabled Etika's arguably

24:41.600 --> 24:45.600
very destructive behaviour, it's important to remember the people who enabled Keemstar's

24:45.600 --> 24:51.480
behaviour to the sort of approach that people enjoy, this sensationalisation from this media

24:51.480 --> 24:52.480
figure.

24:52.480 --> 24:56.200
If no one wanted Keemstar's coverage, then he wouldn't have pulled as many views in.

24:56.200 --> 24:59.880
There weren't enough people stepping in and stating that this was literally the worst

24:59.880 --> 25:04.120
way to go about it, and in a way, it would have been hard for people to do that without

25:04.120 --> 25:05.960
the foresight of what would happen.

25:05.960 --> 25:10.620
Now you could argue that Keemstar should have had that foresight, I agree, but he didn't,

25:10.620 --> 25:15.460
because the lingering doubt held by many people that this was not legitimate, and simply because

25:15.460 --> 25:20.480
Keemstar is no better in many ways, there wasn't an acknowledgement that the consequences

25:20.480 --> 25:22.200
could have turned out this way.

25:22.200 --> 25:26.560
On top of this, you can't really definitively say that if Keemstar and others alike hadn't

25:26.560 --> 25:30.360
publicly mishandled this, Etika would have been absolutely fine.

25:30.360 --> 25:34.940
Keemstar's interview was insensitive and messy, but I highly doubt it would have altered

25:34.940 --> 25:35.940
too much.

25:35.940 --> 25:40.460
I mentioned the Marina Joyce situation earlier, and when that situation transpired she appeared

25:40.460 --> 25:44.760
on an interview with DeFranco, a seemingly more professional news source for sure, but

25:44.760 --> 25:48.400
still with the providence of coverage and traffic nonetheless.

25:48.400 --> 25:53.360
Keemstar's interview, although bad, is much more a symptom rather than a cause.

25:53.360 --> 25:57.040
Ultimately, the difference was that there was just a lack of intervention from many

25:57.040 --> 26:01.120
people, and those who did attempt to intervene weren't close enough to break through.

26:01.120 --> 26:05.240
And honestly, I think the medical authority have come away with a lot less criticism than

26:05.240 --> 26:09.040
they could be receiving, because they should have stepped in themselves, but they just

26:09.040 --> 26:12.880
sent him back home under the impression that it was just a bit of agitation.

26:12.880 --> 26:17.540
To my knowledge, they did not monitor him, despite his continuous public displays towards

26:17.540 --> 26:18.940
himself and others.

26:18.940 --> 26:23.460
It worries me to think how someone who's not a public figure like Etika would be treated.

26:23.460 --> 26:28.100
And listen, Etika did undergo therapy after his first incident, and was clearly having

26:28.100 --> 26:32.420
some sort of help, but I really think more could have been done on the side of professionals

26:32.420 --> 26:36.420
with his initial incident in mind, because regardless of the environment online that

26:36.420 --> 26:41.980
it is incredibly toxic and deserving of its own criticism, online people are not expert

26:41.980 --> 26:42.980
therapists.

26:42.980 --> 26:48.180
A lot of people, at least, we could all do a bit better from being a tad more compassionate,

26:48.180 --> 26:52.980
I do not know if I could honestly blame any online individual for the way this situation

26:52.980 --> 26:57.220
has transpired, because the handling was just a reapplied template.

26:57.220 --> 27:01.180
No one really went out of their way to approach it differently, it's just for the first time

27:01.180 --> 27:05.620
the outcome was very different, and people couldn't begin to rationalise why, so the

27:05.620 --> 27:10.220
fingers started being pointed, when really it was a collective problem that the presence

27:10.220 --> 27:13.920
of some and the absence of others contributed to.

27:13.920 --> 27:15.020
Let's talk about that.

27:18.180 --> 27:26.740
In Etika's final video, he re-treads the experiences he went through from a rather

27:26.740 --> 27:28.100
solemn perspective.

27:28.100 --> 27:36.540
I'm sorry yo, I'm sorry I betrayed your trust, I'm sorry I pushed you all away, I'm sorry

27:36.540 --> 27:44.220
I made a clown of myself, I apologise, I wish it didn't have to be this way.

27:44.220 --> 27:49.420
When Etika posted indecent content on YouTube, and lost so much that he had worked for, it

27:49.420 --> 27:53.220
was a strange scenario that could have been handled very differently.

27:53.220 --> 27:58.740
It was the beginning of a long track to the end, and it brought up a very difficult topic.

27:58.740 --> 28:03.820
YouTube removed Etika's final video altogether, and this provoked many people to criticise

28:03.820 --> 28:04.820
YouTube.

28:04.820 --> 28:09.060
Many people have additionally called on YouTube to restore Etika's original channel, and for

28:09.060 --> 28:11.580
what it's worth, I'd like to echo those calls.

28:11.580 --> 28:15.780
I don't know how practically viable it is, but I think it's important to remember people

28:15.780 --> 28:19.500
for what they should be remembered for, and regardless of what has happened over the last

28:19.500 --> 28:23.500
year to Etika, the content that he brought to the website should always outweigh his

28:23.500 --> 28:27.660
untimely passing, and I think YouTube should pay tribute to that.

28:27.660 --> 28:31.340
YouTube may terminate or place sanctions on a channel for a multitude of reasons, but

28:31.340 --> 28:35.980
for this situation, it seemed protective to make sure that an incident like that doesn't

28:35.980 --> 28:36.980
occur again.

28:36.980 --> 28:41.220
Etika himself was not someone with predatory intent, and still owned other channels on

28:41.220 --> 28:42.220
the website.

28:42.220 --> 28:46.180
With the owner of the channel no longer with us, it is quite clear that the incumbent threat

28:46.180 --> 28:50.900
has ceased to be, and therefore it would be appropriate to, in my opinion, return the

28:50.900 --> 28:53.520
channel, for friends, family, and fans alike.

28:53.520 --> 28:57.460
With that out of the way, should they have ever terminated at all, if he was just going

28:57.460 --> 29:00.060
through a mentally vulnerable episode?

29:00.060 --> 29:02.460
In his video, something he said struck me.

29:31.060 --> 29:33.740
But I ultimately turned down help.

29:33.740 --> 29:37.260
And you know what they say, you can't help somebody who doesn't want to help themselves.

29:37.260 --> 29:40.220
I just didn't realize I needed help.

29:40.220 --> 29:43.140
That's how deluded I was, man.

29:43.140 --> 29:44.140
It's not y'all fault.

29:44.140 --> 29:45.940
I don't want you to blame yourselves.

29:45.940 --> 29:49.100
It's all my fault.

29:49.100 --> 29:51.860
I'm the one that pushed y'all away.

29:51.860 --> 29:57.620
Then I deluded myself into thinking that somehow I didn't destroy a big part of my life, that

29:57.620 --> 29:59.380
somehow I was ahead of the curve.

29:59.380 --> 30:02.580
It was like that heavy delusion that I couldn't pull myself out of.

30:02.580 --> 30:04.780
I didn't even know I was in it.

30:04.780 --> 30:07.240
I was saying and doing things that made no sense.

30:07.240 --> 30:11.740
The way he framed the situation was interesting, because although he takes some responsibility

30:11.740 --> 30:16.700
for what had occurred, it almost felt like he perceived himself as having no other option

30:16.700 --> 30:19.460
given the response to the other instance.

30:19.460 --> 30:24.180
That was what I found so sad while watching the video, the idea that he perceived himself

30:24.180 --> 30:25.220
as in a corner.

30:25.220 --> 30:28.100
The only other option was to take his own life.

30:28.100 --> 30:31.520
Whatever had provoked that shouldn't have occurred, and although there will be some

30:31.520 --> 30:35.940
people who you will never be able to talk out of, I feel that Etika wasn't one of those

30:35.940 --> 30:36.940
people.

30:36.940 --> 30:40.580
I think he would have taken an outstretched hand if he felt it was right for him, but

30:40.580 --> 30:45.340
in his time of vulnerability, many judged him and the authorities punished him, when

30:45.340 --> 30:50.420
really he maybe should have just got his channel back and been monitored a bit more closely.

30:50.420 --> 30:54.780
YouTube makes exceptions for people all the time, where they otherwise shouldn't, and

30:54.780 --> 30:58.980
although you don't want to open the floodgates for people abusing the conditions, I just

30:58.980 --> 31:03.040
don't feel like it would have, even if I don't have a crystal ball.

31:03.040 --> 31:06.900
The point that I stated in brief light of this is that ultimately, whether completely

31:06.900 --> 31:11.740
real or completely fake, the solution doesn't differ too much from an outsider's perspective,

31:11.740 --> 31:15.860
but what we need to do is focus on people getting help from offline sources.

31:15.860 --> 31:19.660
If someone has been driven to the point that they simulate a mental illness, then they

31:19.660 --> 31:23.420
probably need a break and they're still likely suffering from something else.

31:23.420 --> 31:26.860
If they're real, then there should be no question about the course of action.

31:26.860 --> 31:30.700
This isn't to say we shouldn't have a discussion about this stuff and the consequences that

31:30.700 --> 31:31.700
they may yield.

31:31.700 --> 31:35.300
There are people who do abuse mental illness as scapegoats sometimes.

31:35.300 --> 31:38.280
I've spoken about individuals who may be mentally vulnerable.

31:38.280 --> 31:42.220
It doesn't necessarily put a person above criticism, but it's equally important the

31:42.220 --> 31:46.340
sort of criticism that you'll be dealing out, and the sort of mentality that you promote

31:46.340 --> 31:47.780
towards a person.

31:48.660 --> 31:53.940
Let my story be one that advises caution on too much of the social media shit, man.

31:53.940 --> 31:55.980
It can fuck you up.

31:55.980 --> 32:02.060
It can give you an image of what you want your life to be, and it can get blown completely

32:02.060 --> 32:04.820
out of proportion, dog.

32:04.820 --> 32:13.500
Unfortunately, it consumed me, and it made me forget about consequences to my actions.

32:13.500 --> 32:15.660
It made me forget that we have to pay for the things that we say.

32:15.660 --> 32:20.580
It made me forget that there is weight behind words.

32:20.580 --> 32:23.860
I was so consumed with this great image that I had had that I thought I was invulnerable

32:23.860 --> 32:24.860
to everything.

32:24.860 --> 32:29.460
As an example, Edgar said a lot of highly inflammatory things during his second mental

32:29.460 --> 32:34.240
breakdown, and many people took the opportunity to write him off, it seems, due to the rigidity

32:34.240 --> 32:36.380
of some people's moral compasses.

32:36.380 --> 32:41.260
This doesn't validate any of what he said as remotely true or appropriate, and as separate

32:41.260 --> 32:45.460
actions they could well be criticised, but they did not warrant people suddenly judging

32:45.460 --> 32:49.480
a character that was clearly not completely present to think through their actions.

32:49.480 --> 32:54.360
We have to be very careful when we assign a rigid moral value to certain actions that

32:54.360 --> 32:59.660
discount mental state, because you will marginalise people who are suffering and mentally vulnerable,

32:59.660 --> 33:03.120
and I know some people don't want to do that because they don't want certain things

33:03.120 --> 33:07.100
to be quote humanised, but they are human, and when they're coming out of someone who

33:07.100 --> 33:11.600
is losing their mind, it's not going to be from the perception of glorification that

33:11.600 --> 33:13.460
you might criticise others for.

33:13.460 --> 33:17.840
Let me make it clear, there are many reasons for why people might be pissed off, dangerous

33:17.840 --> 33:22.060
behaviour shouldn't just be ignored, and it definitely shouldn't be encouraged, but

33:22.060 --> 33:26.660
it felt like a lot of people used the doubt of legitimacy to write off whatever he was

33:26.660 --> 33:31.420
going through, and give license to rather harsh judgement that he clearly felt.

33:31.420 --> 33:35.780
He felt that he couldn't come back from this, and we should never make someone feel

33:35.780 --> 33:36.780
like that.

33:36.780 --> 33:40.860
We should never make someone like him feel like they can't have a second chance, because

33:40.860 --> 33:42.980
I do think Edgar deserved it.

33:43.020 --> 33:47.700
On top of this, although the online culture did come across as disappointingly unsympathetic,

33:47.700 --> 33:49.140
it wasn't the sole cause.

33:49.140 --> 33:53.560
It's not just the mob alone that will fully drive someone to insanity, it often requires

33:53.560 --> 33:58.220
a lack of support from all corners, and you've got the feeling that Edgar just seems so alone

33:58.220 --> 34:02.380
when he probably needed support most, and pushed many people away.

34:02.380 --> 34:07.400
This isn't to say that there isn't an obligation on anyone to do more, maybe that was how Edgar

34:07.400 --> 34:12.140
set himself up, and most people just didn't anticipate it, but it should always serve

34:12.140 --> 34:16.300
as a reminder that if you have someone in your life that you care about, that you do

34:16.300 --> 34:20.140
genuinely value, make sure you let them know from time to time.

34:20.140 --> 34:25.180
At the end of the day, what we witness publicly is only the tip of a very deep iceberg, and

34:25.180 --> 34:28.940
to judge the person from the situation alone is to miss the point.

34:28.940 --> 34:33.020
However, it was something that many people did, maybe even something that I did when

34:33.020 --> 34:37.420
I took a passing glance, but I think the best thing we can do is try and be more mindful

34:37.420 --> 34:39.460
in the future of what might happen.

34:39.460 --> 34:43.860
There'll be no way to fully prevent these things, and internet trolls will always exist,

34:43.860 --> 34:48.300
but if we can have at least a few people re-evaluate the sort of statements they make, then we

34:48.300 --> 34:49.820
might do a bit better.

34:49.820 --> 34:53.740
As said at the start, I think this was the first time a community suffered something

34:53.740 --> 34:59.500
so intimate to many people, and you can see it all over the site, but we learn, we grow,

34:59.500 --> 35:02.560
and I hope next time we can do a bit better.

35:02.560 --> 35:07.020
When people act like they are mentally suffering, it puts them in a position that isn't inherently

35:07.020 --> 35:08.020
desirable.

35:08.020 --> 35:11.460
Although I can understand why some people may think that such behaviour is baiting for

35:11.460 --> 35:15.220
attention or sympathy, and I can understand why people may want to see who's telling

35:15.220 --> 35:19.220
the truth and who isn't, because we want to be putting the right energy into the right

35:19.220 --> 35:23.660
people, we still have to do it with sensitivity, and with the knowledge that we might be wrong.

35:23.660 --> 35:27.580
Also, regardless of whether you believe mental illness to be real or not, the result of this

35:27.580 --> 35:32.500
situation was from a specific mindset that does deserve exception in its treatment.

35:32.500 --> 35:36.180
Whether that's due to society or not is another question, but unless you're planning

35:36.180 --> 35:40.820
on being the person to uproot society, then you should probably play the game with caution.

35:40.820 --> 35:45.260
I don't think you can hold a single individual accountable for the death of Etika, I think

35:45.260 --> 35:49.500
it was a collective failure due to a limited perspective, though really, I wish someone

35:49.500 --> 35:53.440
had just stepped in at the right time, and that's a reminder, if you have the power

35:53.440 --> 35:58.700
to step in, then don't shy away, you really don't know the difference it might make.

35:58.700 --> 36:02.580
As always with this sort of video, I'll leave links below to suicide hotlines, this

36:02.580 --> 36:07.020
video will not be monetised, because I feel it's a situation that is bigger than all

36:07.020 --> 36:11.480
of us, some people did suggest I monetise it and give the ad sense to charity, but I

36:11.480 --> 36:16.540
feel that would just cause confusion, and it'd likely be demonetised anyway, there'll

36:16.540 --> 36:20.920
be some links to reputable suicide charities below if you want to donate.

36:20.920 --> 36:24.780
Take care of yourself, people.

36:24.780 --> 36:29.700
So yes, that's the video, I want to give a thanks to my editors once again for their

36:29.700 --> 36:34.500
work, I know that this is probably a situation close to many of their hearts, and I'm gonna

36:34.500 --> 36:38.500
leave their links in the pinned comment, go and check them out, send them some love, because

36:38.500 --> 36:40.500
I'm sure this was not an easy one for them.

36:40.500 --> 36:45.660
I'd also like to give a big thanks to my Patreons, thank you for supporting me so much, it makes

36:45.660 --> 36:49.740
a hell of a lot of difference, particularly when dealing with these topics, some of those

36:49.740 --> 36:55.980
Patreons are up on screen right now, I'd like to give a big thanks to two specific Patreons,

36:55.980 --> 37:03.140

else to add, but just take care guys, and I do love you, appreciate you a lot, I'm The
