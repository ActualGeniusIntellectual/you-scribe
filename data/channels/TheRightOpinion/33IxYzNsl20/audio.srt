1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
It's time to get to the truth.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,840
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,280
And my relationship with the media, not a very rosy one to say the least.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,160
And yes, over the coming few minutes, exactly why I have gripes with them will become fairly self-explanatory.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,880
I'm sure if you're familiar with my channel, you'll know where I stand.

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,240
And if you're new here, welcome, and I sincerely apologise for being acquainted under such unfortunate circumstances.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,080
Let's talk about those circumstances.

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,200
This good old gent is Post Malone.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,600
He's an interesting specimen, but all in all, he gets a pass from me just about.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,320
Maybe it wasn't the best that we met on the song called White Iverson, which I still don't really get to this day,

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,040
but I enjoy congratulations, and also rockstar.

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,960
He has a unique style, and there's a certain mood that some of his music suits me, so I get it at least.

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,360
Though it's understandable that a fair few people find him rather insufferable.

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,080
On the personal side, he seems alright.

15
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,880
He seems quite integrated in a community of fairly chill people.

16
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,800
He's very personal and seems like a down-to-earth guy.

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,400
It's more than fair to say that he has made some rather ridiculous remarks, particularly about hip-hop music,

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,480
and was justifiably criticised for them.

19
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,240
They were generalised and poorly thought out.

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,960
He addressed it, he lamented it, water under the bridge, life goes on.

21
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,560
I continue to slowly decompose in my chair.

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,560
But recently, Post Malone landed himself in more hot water.

23
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,360
After a few articles began publishing this one quote, I'm plasting it over Twitter, because that's what gets the clicks these days.

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,120
Now, these news outlets have latched on to the fact that 80% of Twitter don't really feel like reading articles,

25
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,960
for more illicit pleasure from being outraged at the face value quote.

26
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,600
So the hounds were inevitably waiting when, in an interview, he said there's a struggle being a white rapper.

27
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,520
This was perfect material for the gutter websites to once again plaster such a provocative quote all over Twitter,

28
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,080
and subsequently cause a whirlwind of outrage from people who saw the quote and assumed the worst.

29
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,360
What did they assume then?

30
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,800
Well, what they assumed is that it was some whiteboard crying about oppression.

31
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,000
And, of course, when you have a title like that, it's gonna happen.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,640
Now, I don't know if people took it directly out of context or read one of the insufficient articles attempting to somehow compress the situation into a rather simple take of privilege,

33
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,200
but I hope to explain why all this is rather out of proportion and quite detrimental to the whole discussion we're trying to have.

34
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,760
One of these painfully underwritten articles was on Wrap Up, a 21st century hip-hop magazine.

35
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:15,800
It just slathered the quote down, threw some people reacting in a rather upset manner, and spoke about other controversies and closed off the article.

36
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,480
This was also the first article that I had the pleasure of becoming acquainted to within this situation.

37
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,000
So being the curious chap that I am, I decided to look at the original article.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,720
I thought to myself, I know that Post Malone is no wordsmith, but I do not believe that he is under the impression that he is being fundamentally deprived of privileges that any other rapper would find accessible.

39
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,960
And lo and behold, surprise surprise, it was completely taken out of context.

40
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:45,120
The original interview was with GQ Magazine, who also chose a rather unflattering title that gives me flashbacks to a simpler time in internet history.

41
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,880
When I read the article, it is about a conversation between an astute interviewer and Post, with the former delving into the mind of a very interesting man.

42
00:02:51,880 --> 00:03:01,440
It is actually a great article written by someone who clearly wants to understand Post's point of view, but also wants to get Post to understand his, and that mutual empathy really drives a thoughtful piece.

43
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,880
So what about this white rapper question? Well, when pulled up in context, what he says is a lot better understood.

44
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,680
Firstly, acknowledging the question and the response after, it's clear that what he meant was that it was hard as a white rapper

45
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,440
because it's hard to utilize the genre while maintaining that you're not exploiting it, especially given the recent political context.

46
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:25,040
He's looking at his own position from one of scrutiny, that there is a level of sensitivity that is tough as a white rapper to approach the genre.

47
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:34,440
I think that's fairly well acknowledged truth within hip-hop, but the way everyone makes it seem is that he's some privileged white boy throwing his toys out the pram, which from every account is blatantly untrue.

48
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:42,440
Now that's not to say he's entirely right, although I'd say he's more of a warbler than a rapper, he does have to acknowledge that he's using elements of hip-hop, and he definitely leans more towards the genre.

49
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:48,280
Regardless of whether he does want to make just quote-unquote music, the lyrical composition and so on do reflect that sort of culture.

50
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,200
Once again, if that's my only gripe, then it's not a big deal, I find that we're conflating the idea of hip-hop and rap too closely.

51
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:01,160
Malone is definitely hip-hop, but I find his performance rather variant than a typical rapper, and although it's a grey area, both points of view are understandable.

52
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:08,160
So with that in mind, is this continued shallow witch-hunt really justified, or is it just another attempt to pick off someone who's upset a few individuals?

53
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,320
And now those people have made it their life goal to sink this harmless twat.

54
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,400
As the author said, it's clear that Post Malone isn't perfect, but he is willing to learn.

55
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:21,120
I don't know why all these articles on Post Malone in particular pissed me off, because I've always been aware of it, but it would push me over the edge eventually,

56
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,120
how much people on both sides are only paying attention to titles rather than actually what is written in them.

57
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:33,000
And the titles are understandable, it's clickbait, what isn't clickbait anymore, but it provokes this false outrage that perpetuates through social media sites,

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,720
and it leads to this unnecessary hatred of icons who could actually learn themselves.

59
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,440
These people who have a lot of vitriol want to go after this man, Post Malone.

60
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:48,640
He is no threat, he's just a guy with a careless tongue and naive mind, and I do think we should be somewhat mindful when reading such charged titles,

61
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,040
because they may not mean what they appear to.

62
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:58,560
And that's what matters, I do not mind clickbait, I do not mind quotes, I've done it myself, but you have to make sure that what they say is what they mean.

63
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,080
It is more down to the viewer rather than the publication at this point.

64
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,320
I don't like media, I'm never gonna like media, but they do what they do for a reason, and you have to understand that.

65
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,920
So rather than just having these expectations, you just look into it more.

66
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,880
Anyway, I'd love to hear your thoughts, I wanted to cover this because I think there is a greater point to be taken away,

67
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,400
maybe even for me to keep in mind in the future, I'm sure I've jumped the gun a few times,

68
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,600
but when someone's reputation seems to be the one under scrutiny, I find I take it a bit more seriously,

69
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,240
and this just appeared to be the right time to address it.

70
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,360
Maybe I'll do more in the future talking about this stuff, we'll see how this video performs.

71
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,760
Is Post Malone suffering from anti-white privilege in the evil rap genre, or should he be burned at the stake for his culture theft?

72
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,320
Let me know down below. Until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
