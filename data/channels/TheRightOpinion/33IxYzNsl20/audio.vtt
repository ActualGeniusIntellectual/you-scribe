00:00.000 --> 00:01.360
It's time to get to the truth.

00:06.360 --> 00:10.840
Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.

00:10.840 --> 00:14.280
And my relationship with the media, not a very rosy one to say the least.

00:14.280 --> 00:19.160
And yes, over the coming few minutes, exactly why I have gripes with them will become fairly self-explanatory.

00:19.160 --> 00:21.880
I'm sure if you're familiar with my channel, you'll know where I stand.

00:21.880 --> 00:27.240
And if you're new here, welcome, and I sincerely apologise for being acquainted under such unfortunate circumstances.

00:27.240 --> 00:29.080
Let's talk about those circumstances.

00:29.080 --> 00:31.200
This good old gent is Post Malone.

00:31.200 --> 00:35.600
He's an interesting specimen, but all in all, he gets a pass from me just about.

00:35.600 --> 00:40.320
Maybe it wasn't the best that we met on the song called White Iverson, which I still don't really get to this day,

00:40.320 --> 00:43.040
but I enjoy congratulations, and also rockstar.

00:43.040 --> 00:47.960
He has a unique style, and there's a certain mood that some of his music suits me, so I get it at least.

00:47.960 --> 00:51.360
Though it's understandable that a fair few people find him rather insufferable.

00:51.360 --> 00:53.080
On the personal side, he seems alright.

00:53.080 --> 00:55.880
He seems quite integrated in a community of fairly chill people.

00:55.880 --> 00:57.800
He's very personal and seems like a down-to-earth guy.

00:57.800 --> 01:02.400
It's more than fair to say that he has made some rather ridiculous remarks, particularly about hip-hop music,

01:02.400 --> 01:04.480
and was justifiably criticised for them.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.240
They were generalised and poorly thought out.

01:06.240 --> 01:09.960
He addressed it, he lamented it, water under the bridge, life goes on.

01:09.960 --> 01:12.560
I continue to slowly decompose in my chair.

01:12.560 --> 01:15.560
But recently, Post Malone landed himself in more hot water.

01:15.560 --> 01:21.360
After a few articles began publishing this one quote, I'm plasting it over Twitter, because that's what gets the clicks these days.

01:21.360 --> 01:26.120
Now, these news outlets have latched on to the fact that 80% of Twitter don't really feel like reading articles,

01:26.120 --> 01:28.960
for more illicit pleasure from being outraged at the face value quote.

01:28.960 --> 01:33.600
So the hounds were inevitably waiting when, in an interview, he said there's a struggle being a white rapper.

01:33.600 --> 01:38.520
This was perfect material for the gutter websites to once again plaster such a provocative quote all over Twitter,

01:38.520 --> 01:43.080
and subsequently cause a whirlwind of outrage from people who saw the quote and assumed the worst.

01:43.080 --> 01:44.360
What did they assume then?

01:44.360 --> 01:47.800
Well, what they assumed is that it was some whiteboard crying about oppression.

01:47.800 --> 01:51.000
And, of course, when you have a title like that, it's gonna happen.

01:51.000 --> 01:58.640
Now, I don't know if people took it directly out of context or read one of the insufficient articles attempting to somehow compress the situation into a rather simple take of privilege,

01:58.640 --> 02:04.200
but I hope to explain why all this is rather out of proportion and quite detrimental to the whole discussion we're trying to have.

02:04.200 --> 02:08.760
One of these painfully underwritten articles was on Wrap Up, a 21st century hip-hop magazine.

02:08.760 --> 02:15.800
It just slathered the quote down, threw some people reacting in a rather upset manner, and spoke about other controversies and closed off the article.

02:15.800 --> 02:20.480
This was also the first article that I had the pleasure of becoming acquainted to within this situation.

02:20.480 --> 02:24.000
So being the curious chap that I am, I decided to look at the original article.

02:24.000 --> 02:33.720
I thought to myself, I know that Post Malone is no wordsmith, but I do not believe that he is under the impression that he is being fundamentally deprived of privileges that any other rapper would find accessible.

02:33.720 --> 02:37.960
And lo and behold, surprise surprise, it was completely taken out of context.

02:37.960 --> 02:45.120
The original interview was with GQ Magazine, who also chose a rather unflattering title that gives me flashbacks to a simpler time in internet history.

02:45.120 --> 02:51.880
When I read the article, it is about a conversation between an astute interviewer and Post, with the former delving into the mind of a very interesting man.

02:51.880 --> 03:01.440
It is actually a great article written by someone who clearly wants to understand Post's point of view, but also wants to get Post to understand his, and that mutual empathy really drives a thoughtful piece.

03:01.440 --> 03:06.880
So what about this white rapper question? Well, when pulled up in context, what he says is a lot better understood.

03:06.880 --> 03:12.680
Firstly, acknowledging the question and the response after, it's clear that what he meant was that it was hard as a white rapper

03:12.680 --> 03:18.440
because it's hard to utilize the genre while maintaining that you're not exploiting it, especially given the recent political context.

03:18.440 --> 03:25.040
He's looking at his own position from one of scrutiny, that there is a level of sensitivity that is tough as a white rapper to approach the genre.

03:25.040 --> 03:34.440
I think that's fairly well acknowledged truth within hip-hop, but the way everyone makes it seem is that he's some privileged white boy throwing his toys out the pram, which from every account is blatantly untrue.

03:34.440 --> 03:42.440
Now that's not to say he's entirely right, although I'd say he's more of a warbler than a rapper, he does have to acknowledge that he's using elements of hip-hop, and he definitely leans more towards the genre.

03:42.440 --> 03:48.280
Regardless of whether he does want to make just quote-unquote music, the lyrical composition and so on do reflect that sort of culture.

03:48.280 --> 03:54.200
Once again, if that's my only gripe, then it's not a big deal, I find that we're conflating the idea of hip-hop and rap too closely.

03:54.200 --> 04:01.160
Malone is definitely hip-hop, but I find his performance rather variant than a typical rapper, and although it's a grey area, both points of view are understandable.

04:01.160 --> 04:08.160
So with that in mind, is this continued shallow witch-hunt really justified, or is it just another attempt to pick off someone who's upset a few individuals?

04:08.160 --> 04:11.320
And now those people have made it their life goal to sink this harmless twat.

04:11.320 --> 04:15.400
As the author said, it's clear that Post Malone isn't perfect, but he is willing to learn.

04:15.400 --> 04:21.120
I don't know why all these articles on Post Malone in particular pissed me off, because I've always been aware of it, but it would push me over the edge eventually,

04:21.120 --> 04:26.120
how much people on both sides are only paying attention to titles rather than actually what is written in them.

04:26.120 --> 04:33.000
And the titles are understandable, it's clickbait, what isn't clickbait anymore, but it provokes this false outrage that perpetuates through social media sites,

04:33.000 --> 04:36.720
and it leads to this unnecessary hatred of icons who could actually learn themselves.

04:36.720 --> 04:41.440
These people who have a lot of vitriol want to go after this man, Post Malone.

04:41.440 --> 04:48.640
He is no threat, he's just a guy with a careless tongue and naive mind, and I do think we should be somewhat mindful when reading such charged titles,

04:48.640 --> 04:51.040
because they may not mean what they appear to.

04:51.040 --> 04:58.560
And that's what matters, I do not mind clickbait, I do not mind quotes, I've done it myself, but you have to make sure that what they say is what they mean.

04:58.560 --> 05:02.080
It is more down to the viewer rather than the publication at this point.

05:02.080 --> 05:08.320
I don't like media, I'm never gonna like media, but they do what they do for a reason, and you have to understand that.

05:08.320 --> 05:11.920
So rather than just having these expectations, you just look into it more.

05:11.920 --> 05:16.880
Anyway, I'd love to hear your thoughts, I wanted to cover this because I think there is a greater point to be taken away,

05:16.880 --> 05:20.400
maybe even for me to keep in mind in the future, I'm sure I've jumped the gun a few times,

05:20.400 --> 05:24.600
but when someone's reputation seems to be the one under scrutiny, I find I take it a bit more seriously,

05:24.600 --> 05:27.240
and this just appeared to be the right time to address it.

05:27.240 --> 05:31.360
Maybe I'll do more in the future talking about this stuff, we'll see how this video performs.

05:31.360 --> 05:37.760
Is Post Malone suffering from anti-white privilege in the evil rap genre, or should he be burned at the stake for his culture theft?

05:37.760 --> 05:42.320
Let me know down below. Until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
