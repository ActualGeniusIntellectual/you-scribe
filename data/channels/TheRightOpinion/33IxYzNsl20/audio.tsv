0	1360	It's time to get to the truth.
6360	10840	Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time.
10840	14280	And my relationship with the media, not a very rosy one to say the least.
14280	19160	And yes, over the coming few minutes, exactly why I have gripes with them will become fairly self-explanatory.
19160	21880	I'm sure if you're familiar with my channel, you'll know where I stand.
21880	27240	And if you're new here, welcome, and I sincerely apologise for being acquainted under such unfortunate circumstances.
27240	29080	Let's talk about those circumstances.
29080	31200	This good old gent is Post Malone.
31200	35600	He's an interesting specimen, but all in all, he gets a pass from me just about.
35600	40320	Maybe it wasn't the best that we met on the song called White Iverson, which I still don't really get to this day,
40320	43040	but I enjoy congratulations, and also rockstar.
43040	47960	He has a unique style, and there's a certain mood that some of his music suits me, so I get it at least.
47960	51360	Though it's understandable that a fair few people find him rather insufferable.
51360	53080	On the personal side, he seems alright.
53080	55880	He seems quite integrated in a community of fairly chill people.
55880	57800	He's very personal and seems like a down-to-earth guy.
57800	62400	It's more than fair to say that he has made some rather ridiculous remarks, particularly about hip-hop music,
62400	64480	and was justifiably criticised for them.
64480	66240	They were generalised and poorly thought out.
66240	69960	He addressed it, he lamented it, water under the bridge, life goes on.
69960	72560	I continue to slowly decompose in my chair.
72560	75560	But recently, Post Malone landed himself in more hot water.
75560	81360	After a few articles began publishing this one quote, I'm plasting it over Twitter, because that's what gets the clicks these days.
81360	86120	Now, these news outlets have latched on to the fact that 80% of Twitter don't really feel like reading articles,
86120	88960	for more illicit pleasure from being outraged at the face value quote.
88960	93600	So the hounds were inevitably waiting when, in an interview, he said there's a struggle being a white rapper.
93600	98520	This was perfect material for the gutter websites to once again plaster such a provocative quote all over Twitter,
98520	103080	and subsequently cause a whirlwind of outrage from people who saw the quote and assumed the worst.
103080	104360	What did they assume then?
104360	107800	Well, what they assumed is that it was some whiteboard crying about oppression.
107800	111000	And, of course, when you have a title like that, it's gonna happen.
111000	118640	Now, I don't know if people took it directly out of context or read one of the insufficient articles attempting to somehow compress the situation into a rather simple take of privilege,
118640	124200	but I hope to explain why all this is rather out of proportion and quite detrimental to the whole discussion we're trying to have.
124200	128760	One of these painfully underwritten articles was on Wrap Up, a 21st century hip-hop magazine.
128760	135800	It just slathered the quote down, threw some people reacting in a rather upset manner, and spoke about other controversies and closed off the article.
135800	140480	This was also the first article that I had the pleasure of becoming acquainted to within this situation.
140480	144000	So being the curious chap that I am, I decided to look at the original article.
144000	153720	I thought to myself, I know that Post Malone is no wordsmith, but I do not believe that he is under the impression that he is being fundamentally deprived of privileges that any other rapper would find accessible.
153720	157960	And lo and behold, surprise surprise, it was completely taken out of context.
157960	165120	The original interview was with GQ Magazine, who also chose a rather unflattering title that gives me flashbacks to a simpler time in internet history.
165120	171880	When I read the article, it is about a conversation between an astute interviewer and Post, with the former delving into the mind of a very interesting man.
171880	181440	It is actually a great article written by someone who clearly wants to understand Post's point of view, but also wants to get Post to understand his, and that mutual empathy really drives a thoughtful piece.
181440	186880	So what about this white rapper question? Well, when pulled up in context, what he says is a lot better understood.
186880	192680	Firstly, acknowledging the question and the response after, it's clear that what he meant was that it was hard as a white rapper
192680	198440	because it's hard to utilize the genre while maintaining that you're not exploiting it, especially given the recent political context.
198440	205040	He's looking at his own position from one of scrutiny, that there is a level of sensitivity that is tough as a white rapper to approach the genre.
205040	214440	I think that's fairly well acknowledged truth within hip-hop, but the way everyone makes it seem is that he's some privileged white boy throwing his toys out the pram, which from every account is blatantly untrue.
214440	222440	Now that's not to say he's entirely right, although I'd say he's more of a warbler than a rapper, he does have to acknowledge that he's using elements of hip-hop, and he definitely leans more towards the genre.
222440	228280	Regardless of whether he does want to make just quote-unquote music, the lyrical composition and so on do reflect that sort of culture.
228280	234200	Once again, if that's my only gripe, then it's not a big deal, I find that we're conflating the idea of hip-hop and rap too closely.
234200	241160	Malone is definitely hip-hop, but I find his performance rather variant than a typical rapper, and although it's a grey area, both points of view are understandable.
241160	248160	So with that in mind, is this continued shallow witch-hunt really justified, or is it just another attempt to pick off someone who's upset a few individuals?
248160	251320	And now those people have made it their life goal to sink this harmless twat.
251320	255400	As the author said, it's clear that Post Malone isn't perfect, but he is willing to learn.
255400	261120	I don't know why all these articles on Post Malone in particular pissed me off, because I've always been aware of it, but it would push me over the edge eventually,
261120	266120	how much people on both sides are only paying attention to titles rather than actually what is written in them.
266120	273000	And the titles are understandable, it's clickbait, what isn't clickbait anymore, but it provokes this false outrage that perpetuates through social media sites,
273000	276720	and it leads to this unnecessary hatred of icons who could actually learn themselves.
276720	281440	These people who have a lot of vitriol want to go after this man, Post Malone.
281440	288640	He is no threat, he's just a guy with a careless tongue and naive mind, and I do think we should be somewhat mindful when reading such charged titles,
288640	291040	because they may not mean what they appear to.
291040	298560	And that's what matters, I do not mind clickbait, I do not mind quotes, I've done it myself, but you have to make sure that what they say is what they mean.
298560	302080	It is more down to the viewer rather than the publication at this point.
302080	308320	I don't like media, I'm never gonna like media, but they do what they do for a reason, and you have to understand that.
308320	311920	So rather than just having these expectations, you just look into it more.
311920	316880	Anyway, I'd love to hear your thoughts, I wanted to cover this because I think there is a greater point to be taken away,
316880	320400	maybe even for me to keep in mind in the future, I'm sure I've jumped the gun a few times,
320400	324600	but when someone's reputation seems to be the one under scrutiny, I find I take it a bit more seriously,
324600	327240	and this just appeared to be the right time to address it.
327240	331360	Maybe I'll do more in the future talking about this stuff, we'll see how this video performs.
331360	337760	Is Post Malone suffering from anti-white privilege in the evil rap genre, or should he be burned at the stake for his culture theft?
337760	342320	Let me know down below. Until then, I'm The Right Opinion, and I'll see you in the next one.
