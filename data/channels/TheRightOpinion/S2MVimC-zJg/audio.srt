1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,860
Summer, 2017. Who can forget.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,860
It's everyday bro.

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,860
Do you want to jump in?

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,860
Absolute mayhem.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,860
I'm out of fire right now? She just punched me.

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,340
Winter. An unrivalled nightmare.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,200
I'm literally stuck here. There's lines of cars starting with that giant truck.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,200
Careers were launched, reputations were established, and people were once again

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,200
falling head over heels for drama that seemed so inconsequential in many of our lives.

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,200
Summer 18 was around the corner, and many were anticipating the shenanigans

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,200
that all of these characters would be caught up in, or at least we thought we were.

12
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,060
Because as the holidays dawned, there was a distinct lack of interest.

13
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,060
In fact, fellow YouTuber NerdCity released a video in which he documented

14
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:05,060
all of Jake Paul's antics over the summer, antics that were arguably much worse

15
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,060
than anything originally documented in 2017.

16
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,060
And yet, if it hadn't been for some very ruthless marketing, in spite of its excellency,

17
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,060
it probably wouldn't have even reached its current view count.

18
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,060
700,000, not bad, but hardly the peaks of the drama over the previous year.

19
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,920
So, the only question on our lips is, where had all the views gone?

20
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,920
Here on my channel, I talk about beauty.

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,920
I want to talk to you guys in this video, it's been so long.

22
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,920
What's up everybody?

23
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,920
My name is Manny Amiwe for those of you who might not know who I am.

24
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,920
Well.

25
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,920
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion,

26
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,920
the home of a twat with too much free time,

27
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,780
and I think it's time for a story.

28
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,780
I think we've had enough of those sorts of story times for now.

29
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,780
Anyhow, I have a Twitter, and like most people with a Twitter, I follow people.

30
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,780
When people follow me, I typically check out their account to see what sort of individuals I'm appealing to,

31
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,780
and in some instances, they may be YouTubers for whom I'll check out their channel

32
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,780
and see if their Twitter's worth keeping up with.

33
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,780
And at some point at the start of the summer, a person by the name of T-Spill followed me.

34
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,780
I checked out their channel, around 15,000 subscribers, not a bad amount going on,

35
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,640
so I thought, you know what, I'll follow them back and see what happens with their channel.

36
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,640
They also had their subscriptions public,

37
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,640
and because I have a bit of a vanity project going on,

38
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,640
I often check my most popular subscribers,

39
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,640
see whose attention I have,

40
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,640
and I noticed they were subscribed to me,

41
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,640
but fairly low down on the pecking order.

42
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,640
However, with every passing week, I noticed them climbing,

43
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,640
gradually and then rapidly ascending,

44
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,640
and I thought to myself,

45
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,640
what on earth is going on?

46
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,640
The channel moved from 15k to 13k to 60k to 150k and so much more.

47
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
So this is when I found out all about these people.

48
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,500
And if we were going by T-Spill's thumbnails and titles,

49
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,500
this was a non-stop festival of pure drama.

50
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,500
And to be honest, they looked like people who loved a bit of spice.

51
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,500
So what of this new rise to the top of such individuals?

52
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Well, they're members of what is known as the beauty community.

53
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Now, when you're as good looking as me,

54
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
you don't really need any makeup to stay beautiful.

55
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,500
However, as implied, these are a set of creators

56
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,500
who are focused on the testing of commercial beauty products.

57
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,500
But this isn't any old beauty community,

58
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,360
we're not talking about Zoella here.

59
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,360
As interesting as that is, we're talking about a community

60
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,360
that has really popularized the nature of spilling tea

61
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,360
and embodied a culture like no other.

62
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,360
And you'll soon see what I mean.

63
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,360
This sort of content seems to have been performing

64
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,360
fairly successfully for a while.

65
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,360
There are a fair few prominent creators in this community,

66
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,360
one of them being Jeffree Star,

67
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,360
who has a fairly hefty 10 million subscribers.

68
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,360
Not the most,

69
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,360
but he's more well known for his outgoing personality.

70
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,360
As said, there are a load of other prominent figures

71
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,220
in this community, a load of people

72
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,220
who are very interested in that little sass.

73
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,220
With the rise of channels like Teaspill

74
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,220
and other content creators reporting

75
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,220
on the shenanigans of these creators,

76
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,220
it seems there must be a lot to discuss.

77
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,220
And really, the question that I want to answer

78
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,220
at the end of all this is why?

79
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,220
Why do people start caring about the drama

80
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,220
of a community that has been functioning

81
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,220
fairly competently for years prior,

82
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,220
and why should people care?

83
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,220
Or, should people care?

84
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,220
These are all questions that many of us here

85
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,080
ask for today, because honestly,

86
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,080
I'm just as confused as the rest of you.

87
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,080
Why did this

88
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,080
talk to you guys

89
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,080
in this video?

90
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,080
It's been so hard.

91
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,080
Why are you crying?

92
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,080
outdo this.

93
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,080
Tonight's the night!

94
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,080
Despite my grades, I knew I was smart.

95
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,080
Are you a Jake Pauler?

96
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,080
Kiss me with a mouth.

97
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,080
You're my mom.

98
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,080
I thought it was sexy, okay?

99
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,940
I just learned about

100
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,940
their most romantic moments.

101
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,940
I think we need to find out.

102
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,940
But first, as I assume many of you will be

103
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,940
unfamiliar with this, given my audience,

104
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,940
I think we should have a rundown of the drama

105
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,940
and see what everyone's freaking out about.

106
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,940
Courtesy of my field correspondent,

107
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,940
J. Aubrey, or Jorbrey, or whatever,

108
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,940
I never really asked him what his preferred

109
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,940
name was, so I'll just do both.

110
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,940
Fuck the system, take it away,

111
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,940
my good man.

112
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
If YouTube were a well-oiled machine,

113
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
then it would be fueled purely

114
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
by tea. So much so

115
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
that you now have entire channels

116
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
dedicated to the art form of

117
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
spilling tea, keeping you up to speed

118
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,800
on who said what today, who made an

119
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
apology this week, who dropped

120
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,800
the n-word five years ago, you know,

121
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
the usual. But for someone on the outside

122
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
looking in, it can understandably

123
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,800
get a bit messy.

124
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
I'm not sure if this is the best

125
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
way to explain it, but

126
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,660
it can understandably get a bit messy in some areas.

127
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,660
So let's you and me take a little journey

128
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,660
down the rabbit hole here, as we explore

129
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,660
all the succulent drama that has transpired

130
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,660
in the YouTube beauty community

131
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,660
as of late. If we want to get a clear

132
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,660
picture of this saga in its entirety,

133
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,660
then we need to revert back to the beginning.

134
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,660
The year is 2016, the beauty community

135
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,660
has been popping off for a very considerable

136
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,660
amount of time, with the makeup

137
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,660
guru Heavyweight spearheading the

138
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,660
genre. Manny MUA, Laura Lee,

139
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,660
and Jeffree Star were of the notable

140
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,660
characters involved during this

141
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,660
ethereal era of seemingly never-ending

142
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,660
amity and goodwill.

143
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,660
The three were inseparable, collaborating

144
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,660
and helping each other out without a hint

145
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,660
of hesitation that is until things

146
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,660
got a little bit...odd.

147
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,660
Over time, the trio began to grow

148
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,660
more distant, thus a cold blanket

149
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,660
of uncertainty was soon draped

150
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,660
over the community. These figureheads began

151
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,660
shading one another in the eye of the public,

152
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,660
Jeffree going so far as to take to Snapchat

153
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,660
where he would constantly drivel on about

154
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,660
fake friends and backstabbers,

155
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,660
causing more and more speculation

156
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,660
amongst viewers. What had happened

157
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,660
to this group of creators who were once

158
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,660
so close to one another?

159
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,660
Fast forward to August of 2018, and

160
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,660
Shane's docuseries on Jeffree Star

161
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,660
takes the internet by storm.

162
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,660
Being an incredibly extensive look into the

163
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,660
makeup mogul's lifestyle, it obviously

164
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,660
got a lot of people talking. Not just

165
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,660
audiences, but Star's past acquaintances

166
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,660
as well. Didn't take long

167
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,660
for Gabriel Zamora to post

168
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,660
this picture of him, Nikita

169
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,660
Dragon, Manny, and Laura

170
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,660
flipping the camera off with the especially

171
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,660
spicy caption,

172
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,660
This one tweet

173
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,660
ignited a firestorm overnight

174
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,660
with Gabriel then going on an entire

175
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,660
tangent about how racist Jeffree

176
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,660
happened to be. This led to some digging

177
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,660
into Gabriel's past, and imagine

178
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,660
my shock, Jeffree's fans were quick

179
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,660
to turn the tables. But the disconcerting

180
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,660
comments didn't stop at Gabriel Zamora.

181
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,660
In fact, it seemed like a few other

182
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,660
friends had some interesting opinions

183
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,660
on certain races too.

184
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,660
And soon enough, well, Twitter

185
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,660
did its thing.

186
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,660
Seeing as nearly everyone was exposed for being a massive

187
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,660
hypocrite, the outcry amongst fans began

188
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,660
and well, damage control can only

189
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,660
do so much. In fact, Laura Lee's apology

190
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,660
video was really the nail in her coffin

191
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,660
as her channel began bleeding subs

192
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,660
soon after. Laura Lee is now one of the most

193
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,660
unsubscribed to channels on the entire

194
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,660
website, causing a massive

195
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,660
downfall that forced herself and others

196
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,660
into an extended hiatus.

197
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,660
TLDR, no one really knows what happened

198
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,660
amongst the three, everyone has their own theories

199
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,660
of what could have happened, but it doesn't matter

200
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,660
now because everyone hates them regardless due to

201
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,660
their racist and hypocritical pasts.

202
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,660
Hope that sheds some sort of light onto things.

203
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,660
Now to throw it back to Tro before he slanders

204
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,660
my good name again by calling me

205
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,660
Jabri. I mean, come on man, is it that hard?

206
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,660
There's a space right there. It's right there, right

207
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,660
RIGHT FUCKING THERE!

208
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,660
Wow. One exhilarating

209
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,660
rundown. Now we know why people

210
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,660
care about this so much. I feel like

211
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,660
I've been electrified. The tea is

212
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,660
running through my veins. Please

213
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,660
go and check out my boy,

214
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,660
Jabri. He's a great friend of the channel and

215
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,660
an upcoming creator who's obviously

216
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,660
destined for great things.

217
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,660
So in the last few months, we all started using phrases

218
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,660
to do with tea. Honestly, I didn't

219
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,660
know originally where they were sourced.

220
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,660
I assumed they were from the sassy

221
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,660
talk show hosts because of their respective

222
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,660
gifts. However, I realise now

223
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,660
the beauty community has been using it

224
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,660
long before any of us plebs ever

225
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,660
acknowledged its existence.

226
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,660
I just wanna give you guys a quick little

227
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,660
tea that I

228
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,660
am in a hotel room, so the lighting and sound

229
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,660
is gonna be a little different.

230
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,660
This was 11 months ago, yet the cultural

231
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,660
phenomenon only blessed us recently.

232
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,660
Now of course, this series with

233
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,660
Shane and all the following hijinks

234
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,660
has really been the peak of the drama. However,

235
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,660
it's been building up a while before.

236
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,660
Why did people suddenly start caring?

237
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,660
That's what I want to answer first.

238
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,660
Well, let's first establish one

239
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,660
premise. Every community has drama.

240
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,660
There is no community above

241
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,660
this simple fact. When you have a collective people

242
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,660
sharing in the same genre, you will have conflict.

243
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,660
Even in cases where the community seems

244
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,660
benign, like the animation community,

245
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,660
it is unavoidable. However, drama in

246
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,660
most circumstances is trivial.

247
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,660
Even stuff that people make huge long

248
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,660
videos on won't have a huge impact

249
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,660
in our lives. So what really matters

250
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,660
in whether drama has significance

251
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,660
to people? Well, like everything

252
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,660
is the reaction. I think that's the first

253
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,660
important point to remember. Before

254
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,660
all of these charades, the beauty community

255
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,660
definitely demonstrated the potential for the

256
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,660
sort of quarrels that we've witnessed over the last

257
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,660
few months, and that's mainly because

258
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,660
they're melodramatic people. And this

259
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,660
should surprise no one, because it is a

260
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,660
stereotype, and although I'm not necessarily

261
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,660
fond of stereotypes, when it comes to topics

262
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,660
that are based more on human free will and decision,

263
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,660
it may attract a certain sort of

264
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,660
person, and create a group of people with at least

265
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,660
some overlap in traits.

266
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,660
The people today are very camp,

267
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,660
very expressive, and of course, as mentioned,

268
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,660
very dramatic. So when all of these situations

269
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,660
transpired, it was inevitable that no matter

270
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,660
how negligible these predicaments were,

271
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,660
it was going to cause huge ripples

272
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,660
amongst the community. This is all

273
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,660
worth remembering. The next point to remember

274
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,660
is that just because there was an

275
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,660
absence of reported transgressions,

276
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,660
doesn't mean there was an absence of

277
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,660
transgressions. I've said this all before, and I'll

278
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,660
say it again, without the existence of

279
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,660
commentary, many of these individuals would not

280
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,660
be held to account. And let me tell you,

281
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,660
people like Jeffree Star have been causing drama

282
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,660
for ages. It's just a long time

283
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,660
it had its own realms of existence,

284
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,660
and I highly doubt that before all of the

285
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,660
drama channels documenting it popped up,

286
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,660
that there was just this complete

287
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,660
absence of wrongdoings. In fact,

288
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,660
there are a couple channels who have been up for

289
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,660
a bit longer covering this. That would be

290
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,660
my guess anyway, given how quickly all

291
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,660
of these channels had a backlog of content

292
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,660
when they set up, seems like it was something fairly

293
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,660
endemic before. With all of this drama

294
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,660
suddenly erupting, you might think the beauty community

295
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,660
itself has just blown up in 2018,

296
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,660
and if you didn't watch their content,

297
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,660
you may not have even encountered their channels,

298
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,660
so the naivety is completely understandable.

299
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,660
But the truth of the matter is that many of the people

300
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,660
that we'll be talking about today, Jeffree Star

301
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,660
Laura Lee, have been extremely

302
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,660
successful for the last couple years at least,

303
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,660
and in the last Shane Dawson's little series,

304
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,660
which Star has definitely experienced a spike in stardom,

305
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,660
the drama videos didn't actually cause a huge

306
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,660
impact on the traffic these channels

307
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,660
received, within their own fanbases

308
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,660
at least. However, it has definitely led to

309
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,660
a level of accountability that many of these individuals

310
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,660
were not accustomed to. But if the beauty

311
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,660
community aren't exactly experiencing

312
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,660
exponential growth, why is there this influx

313
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,660
of reported drama? So there are a

314
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,660
few things that I believe are worth documenting

315
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,660
here. The beauty community, as I said,

316
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,660
has always had drama, that's important,

317
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,660
it was fairly run-the-mill TMZ-level

318
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,660
stuff, but it was almost an accessory to

319
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,660
the channels. A bit of tea here and there

320
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,660
was normal. This changed for a plethora

321
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,660
of reasons. As I said, the increase of

322
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,660
these drama channels definitely generated a

323
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,660
new level of scrutiny onto these creators.

324
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,660
But on top of this, why did the beauty channel

325
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,660
drama appear to take over from individuals

326
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,660
like Jake and Logan Paul? And I'm not

327
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,660
saying they didn't have any drama, they

328
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,660
had their boxing match, but no one seems to have the

329
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,660
ability to quote, expose them anymore.

330
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,660
Even the boxing match wasn't a particularly

331
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,660
profitable trending topic for many YouTubers.

332
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,660
Well, we have to go back to January to

333
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,660
understand that, back to an event which, as

334
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,660
mentioned earlier, was a defining moment

335
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,660
for many creators, which was Logan

336
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,660
Paul's little excursion. Now, the

337
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,660
whole situation was disastrous for him, yet

338
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,660
at the same time, in hindsight, although

339
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,660
he's not experiencing the views that he

340
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,660
was at the peak of his fame, Logan Paul

341
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,660
and his brother Jake are experiencing

342
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,660
considerable success, minus the criticism,

343
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,660
which is a pretty sound combination,

344
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,660
because although some may argue that any

345
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,660
press is good press, not having YouTube

346
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,660
at your throat is pretty great.

347
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,660
But why did people just lay off?

348
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,660
To understand this, we have to ask

349
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,660
ourselves, how are people being

350
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,660
exposed? Well, some may say, when

351
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,660
you do something bad.

352
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,660
But I disagree. Someone being

353
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,660
exposed is when they're shown as doing something

354
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,660
bad for their own standards, and because

355
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,660
Logan Paul set the bar so low

356
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,660
with his behaviour, he eventually fell out

357
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,660
of interest, because videos documenting

358
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,660
his questionable actions no longer became

359
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,660
questionable for him. The views

360
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,660
fell out, and even though the Paul brothers

361
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,660
are arguably just as egregious as

362
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,660
before, no one seems to care

363
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,660
anymore. Commentators who covered

364
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,660
these topics, realising the subject was

365
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,660
kinda dead, then moved in two different ways.

366
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,660
They either went to more nuanced

367
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,660
commentary, covering topics that were

368
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,660
more timeless, or they went into the whole

369
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,660
reaction commentary trend, which was just emerging

370
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,660
from a very obsessive Dr. Phil phase.

371
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,660
However, not all audiences were

372
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,660
interested in that. They're not the same

373
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,660
genres, after all. Some people still want

374
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,660
to see YouTubers being held to account for

375
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,660
misconduct. This meant there was almost a

376
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,660
leftover audience vying for some sort of

377
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,660
drama, and here they had huge potential

378
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,660
for it. And this is where this

379
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,660
little community of people was almost

380
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,660
roped into this culture, without their

381
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,660
consent, and it was almost custom-made.

382
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,660
Their naturally sassy personalities made

383
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,660
their reactions almost priceless. They had

384
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,660
an audience that was equally susceptible to

385
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,660
being engaged in drama, they had these personas

386
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,660
that were built on the foundations of being

387
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,660
friendly, smiley, to the audience,

388
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,660
and as an audience, your perception of

389
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,660
these people was very precious. They need

390
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,660
to trust these guys when they're going out

391
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,660
to buy their brands. Being a judge is

392
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,660
a role that is built on trust,

393
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,660
and moving away from just beauty products

394
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,660
gave greater potential for this situation.

395
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,660
In fact, I'd argue the relationship

396
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,660
that beauty gurus perpetuate

397
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,660
is even deeper than any genre discussed

398
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,660
on this channel before. They open up about

399
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,660
a lot, in very emotional ways,

400
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,660
which is great, but it also means there is a

401
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,660
level of consistency that they will be

402
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,660
held to account on, and with a

403
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,660
community, there will always be some people

404
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,660
who don't have genuine personas, and

405
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,660
exaggerate or fabricate to try and win over

406
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,660
audiences. So when the drama scene

407
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,660
burst through the door, dying to cover this,

408
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,660
it was going to be raucous, because the

409
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,660
community is a breeding ground for

410
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,660
factions and drama. You had

411
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,660
a load of volatile individuals who are

412
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,660
sassy as hell, and yet, at the same time,

413
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,660
love to share a unique relationship

414
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,660
with the audience. However, what we have

415
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,660
explained was how the market opened up

416
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,660
for these individuals, but why did everything

417
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,660
erupt as perfectly as it did?

418
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,660
So, I was doing my research, and I noticed

419
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,660
a trend. A lot of these drama

420
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,660
channels who were covering it were sourced

421
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,660
approximately a year ago, when some of them

422
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,660
were doing this thing where they would select a clip

423
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,660
and edit it in a way.

424
00:15:54,660 --> 00:16:02,660
In fact, many of them popped up in the window

425
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,660
over a couple months, which is very intriguing

426
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,660
in itself, as although it's natural

427
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,660
for people to create channels covering

428
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,660
something when it's doing relatively

429
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,660
well, there was no clear motive in this

430
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,660
instance that would exactly warrant it.

431
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,660
But whatever, I don't think anything shady

432
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,660
is going on, so who cares? Many of these

433
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,660
channels then diverged in different

434
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,660
directions, realising that there was clearly

435
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,660
a lot more to do, but all while enabling

436
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,660
these foundations, and as a lot of the other drama

437
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,660
became stale to audiences, there was

438
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,660
almost just a slight enough bridge from

439
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,660
what we've seen, like the Paul brothers,

440
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,660
to this community. Arguably,

441
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,660
that bridge was paved by creators such as

442
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,660
Tana Mongeau and Shane Dawson, who had

443
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,660
both roots in commentary and beauty,

444
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,660
although themselves being rather independent.

445
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,660
This probably lent some algorithmic

446
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,660
purpose to permit the sort of

447
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,660
sass that we've observed of recent. All of

448
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,660
these channels are also very well organised

449
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,660
with the sort of content they're creating, in fact

450
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,660
some of them seem pretty synchronised with

451
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,660
their narrative. For example, Teaspill and

452
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,660
HereForTheTea, at the time of writing this,

453
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,660
released trailers for their Jaclyn Hill collab,

454
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,660
and the trailers were identical. Now this

455
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,660
next part is conjecture, however I feel

456
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,660
it is fairly well grounded. A lot of these creators

457
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,660
in the past year have been branching out

458
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,660
their personas, they've been doing more personal

459
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,660
videos, I can't exactly say why,

460
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,660
but if I were to theorise, I'd say that due

461
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,660
to the influx of more scrutiny

462
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,660
from channels that are attempting to analyse

463
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,660
their appeal, they try and create a

464
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,660
third dimension, they try and introduce

465
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,660
another facet to their character that is

466
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,660
more than just makeup, after all, anyone

467
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,660
has access to makeup, anyone can

468
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,660
criticise it, anyone can criticise your

469
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,660
own brands, even. People can judge

470
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,660
it. What they can't necessarily contradict

471
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,660
is your character, and eventually this led

472
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,660
to everyone using deep stories to try and

473
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,660
elevate the perception their audience has

474
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,660
of them, and then when other people witnessed

475
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,660
this, they realised they had to compete in this

476
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,660
market as well, and eventually created

477
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,660
a new culture of deep opening up

478
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,660
emotional videos.

479
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,660
But equally this meant that their persona was

480
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,660
no longer a simple, sassy element of a channel

481
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,660
who could become involved in drama,

482
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,660
it became an issue of actual standards.

483
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,660
But the bigger they are, the harder they

484
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,660
fall, and when the whole situation surrounding

485
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,660
Jeffree Star, digging up the racist comments

486
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,660
from years ago because they didn't like what he was

487
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,660
doing now, it was a perfect example of

488
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,660
when someone's own perception of self

489
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,660
becomes over inflated, and they do

490
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,660
something fucking stupid, which it was,

491
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,660
and in a way, what many of these people

492
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,660
had said in the past years were not

493
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,660
any worse than what Jeffree Star said,

494
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,660
but what really got them were their own crafted

495
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,660
narratives. Firstly, they centred themselves

496
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,660
as this bastion, then they created

497
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,660
an implicit law which told their audience

498
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,660
if you've made racist tweets in the

499
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,660
past, then you should not be supported,

500
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,660
which is subjective, and

501
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,660
many people, justifiably, don't agree

502
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,660
to it, but it is subjective, and that's

503
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,660
important. However, another implicit

504
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,660
law that is pretty universally applied

505
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,660
that is almost assumed, is that you would

506
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,660
apply the standards that you apply to other

507
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,660
people onto yourself. So when it was

508
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,660
revealed that many of the individuals attempting

509
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,660
to bury poor old, or rich

510
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,660
old, or rich young Jeffree Star

511
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,660
over here, had also posted some

512
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,660
fairly questionable content, it essentially

513
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,660
completely backfired, and when their

514
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,660
authenticity was really put in question,

515
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,660
when they had to make everyone's favourite

516
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,660
sincere apology video, it all

517
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,660
fell down for a few of them. Many people

518
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,660
who've dealt with audiences and their judgement

519
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,660
know that they care much more for the

520
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,660
context of what it says about a character

521
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,660
than just barebones, heat of the moment

522
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,660
reactions.

523
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:40,660
None of these beauty gurus were really

524
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,660
perceptive enough to gauge that, their

525
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,660
engagement with these topics was elementary

526
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,660
and they paid the ultimate price,

527
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,660
and it hit them hard. We're talking

528
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,660
content cop level hard, their

529
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,660
subscribers punished them, because

530
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,660
there was this image, completely shattered,

531
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,660
which had only been made worse by the

532
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,660
fact that they'd attempted to embellish this

533
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,660
in the months prior, and that's what this all

534
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,660
represents, the perfect storm, this was

535
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,660
the perfect type of place for commentary

536
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,660
to settle for the summer, and for some

537
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,660
audiences too, because while Jake

538
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,660
and Logan were arguably behaving much

539
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,660
worse, people much more love to hear about the other

540
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,660
side of a person, that's where the whole

541
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,660
exposed term comes from,

542
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,660
and with the cultivation of all these drama channels

543
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,660
that really relished in the algorithmic

544
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,660
cycles to drive home this notion, it

545
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,660
all cultivated an environment for it to

546
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,660
take the place of the previous generation

547
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,660
of drama, drama is natural,

548
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,660
drama is organic, in many ways drama

549
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,660
is expected, because drama will yield from

550
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,660
conflict, and conflict happens when you interact

551
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,660
with other human beings, and honestly if there

552
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,660
wasn't any drama, you'd feel like it was a bit

553
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,660
insincere, at the same time

554
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,660
forcing drama will naturally make you

555
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,660
susceptible to being labelled as an

556
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,660
instigator, something equally unpopular

557
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,660
with an audience, but that's what these movements

558
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,660
represent, a change in position,

559
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,660
that's what drama does, if you don't

560
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,660
come out of drama at least thinking differently

561
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,660
of one of the people involved, then

562
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,660
chances are the tea was a tad cold,

563
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,660
for some reason, drama in the beauty

564
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,660
community, as seemingly obvious as it should

565
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,660
be, was ignored by many for the reasons

566
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,660
that I believe many perceived it as too

567
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,660
tabloid, drama was an accessory

568
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,660
as I said, however as the creators

569
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,660
in it sought to increase their social

570
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,660
standing and character depth, it gave those

571
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,660
on the outside more to chew on, and

572
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,660
more to judge, and through the facilitation

573
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,660
by other creators, the drama of the

574
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,660
beauty community quickly spread,

575
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,660
and we ended up here, with it arguably

576
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,660
being the most viewed drama of the

577
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,660
summer, and many of you, like me, probably

578
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,660
didn't even know about it. So

579
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,660
what for the future? I think it's difficult to

580
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,660
exactly say how long this will persist

581
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,660
as said drama is typically perpetuated

582
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,660
through the shifting perception between

583
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,660
viewer and creator, this is more possible

584
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,660
when there are more ways for a person's image

585
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,660
to be shifted, which is why a heavy

586
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,660
incident can equally kill potential for drama

587
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,660
as it may stimulate it, it appears

588
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,660
we may have had that huge drama,

589
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,660
though in the grand scheme of things

590
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,660
it's fairly inconsequential, so

591
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,660
there's definitely room for it to manifest,

592
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,660
the simple fact of the matter is that we

593
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,660
viewers like to think that we are holding people

594
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,660
to a moral standard, and we are to an extent,

595
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,660
but we have two sets of standards,

596
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,660
what is acceptable to

597
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,660
society, and what is acceptable

598
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,660
for a person or a community.

599
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,660
Now all of this drama is quite small in the grand

600
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,660
scheme of society, it doesn't change our

601
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,660
lives, Laura Lee hasn't gone out and

602
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,660
assaulted anyone, she's just been a bit of a

603
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,660
dick, but audiences haven't gravitated

604
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,660
to this group of people because

605
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,660
anything particularly egregious is going on,

606
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,660
it's just a new set of fresh

607
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,660
meat for us to get our kicks out of,

608
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,660
because they see themselves as

609
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,660
gurus, and we love to topple

610
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,660
people, when it comes to drama, it's

611
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,660
a fair weather morality, a set of dramatic

612
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,660
people with dramatic audiences

613
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,660
in dramatic situations, trying

614
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,660
to be moral dictators,

615
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,660
but once you become the dictator, the

616
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,660
only way is down, and

617
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,660
that's the tea my friends, that's

618
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,660
the fucking tea, see

619
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,660
I said it.

620
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,660
I want to thank two people

621
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,660
with regards to the creation of this video,

622
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,660
firstly, J Aubrey, J Aubrey,

623
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,660
whatever you wanna bloody call him,

624
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,660
for his absolutely barnstorming

625
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,660
part, he's a great creator, check him out

626
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,660
as I said, and secondly, T Spill herself

627
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,660
for checking my scripts with regards to

628
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,660
the topic and making sure the information

629
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,660
I was basing my judgements off was

630
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,660
accurate, I think that's one of the key

631
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,660
elements of a creator, I'd also like to give

632
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,660
a massive thanks to the editors, who once again,

633
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,660
fantastic work, great job,

634
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,660
definitely check them out, some of these guys

635
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,660
are really up there with the best,

636
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,660
and they will inevitably do

637
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,660
great things with their lives, so definitely go and

638
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,660
send them some love, because without them,

639
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,660
the channel would not be here. Anyhow, I don't think I have

640
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,660
too much else to say, I'd love to hear your thoughts

641
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,660
on the topic, even though I feel like

642
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,660
this is probably something slightly more

643
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,660
unfamiliar with my audiences, so if

644
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,660
this is your first encounter with it, then

645
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,660
honestly, I'd really like to hear your thoughts too actually,

646
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,660
because, you know, first impressions

647
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,660
mean a lot. If this is your first

648
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,660
impression with me, I hope it was a good one too,

649
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,660
if not, well, I'll try and work on that in the future.

650
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,660
Also, if you wanna reach me on Twitter,

651
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,660
at TheRightOpinion, as I said earlier,

652
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,660
Facebook, I use that too, though I haven't used it

653
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,660
as much recently, Discord, another thing

654
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,660
that I love to involve myself in.

655
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,660
All those mediums you can reach me on.

656
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,660
I'm an accessible man, even though I do

657
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,660
tend to be very busy, so

658
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,660
apologies if replies aren't immediate.

659
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,660
Anyhow, until the next one,

660
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,660
I'm TheRightOpinion, and I'll see you then.

661
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,660
Thanks for watching!
