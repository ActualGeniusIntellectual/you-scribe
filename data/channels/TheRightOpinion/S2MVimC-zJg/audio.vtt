00:00.000 --> 00:05.860
Summer, 2017. Who can forget.

00:05.860 --> 00:09.860
It's everyday bro.

00:09.860 --> 00:14.860
Do you want to jump in?

00:14.860 --> 00:15.860
Absolute mayhem.

00:15.860 --> 00:20.860
I'm out of fire right now? She just punched me.

00:20.860 --> 00:25.340
Winter. An unrivalled nightmare.

00:26.200 --> 00:30.200
I'm literally stuck here. There's lines of cars starting with that giant truck.

00:36.200 --> 00:41.200
Careers were launched, reputations were established, and people were once again

00:41.200 --> 00:45.200
falling head over heels for drama that seemed so inconsequential in many of our lives.

00:45.200 --> 00:49.200
Summer 18 was around the corner, and many were anticipating the shenanigans

00:49.200 --> 00:52.200
that all of these characters would be caught up in, or at least we thought we were.

00:53.060 --> 00:57.060
Because as the holidays dawned, there was a distinct lack of interest.

00:57.060 --> 01:01.060
In fact, fellow YouTuber NerdCity released a video in which he documented

01:01.060 --> 01:05.060
all of Jake Paul's antics over the summer, antics that were arguably much worse

01:05.060 --> 01:08.060
than anything originally documented in 2017.

01:08.060 --> 01:12.060
And yet, if it hadn't been for some very ruthless marketing, in spite of its excellency,

01:12.060 --> 01:15.060
it probably wouldn't have even reached its current view count.

01:15.060 --> 01:20.060
700,000, not bad, but hardly the peaks of the drama over the previous year.

01:20.920 --> 01:24.920
So, the only question on our lips is, where had all the views gone?

01:24.920 --> 01:26.920
Here on my channel, I talk about beauty.

01:26.920 --> 01:31.920
I want to talk to you guys in this video, it's been so long.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.920
What's up everybody?

01:33.920 --> 01:35.920
My name is Manny Amiwe for those of you who might not know who I am.

01:35.920 --> 01:37.920
Well.

01:43.920 --> 01:45.920
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion,

01:45.920 --> 01:47.920
the home of a twat with too much free time,

01:48.780 --> 01:50.780
and I think it's time for a story.

01:50.780 --> 01:52.780
I think we've had enough of those sorts of story times for now.

01:52.780 --> 01:57.780
Anyhow, I have a Twitter, and like most people with a Twitter, I follow people.

01:57.780 --> 02:02.780
When people follow me, I typically check out their account to see what sort of individuals I'm appealing to,

02:02.780 --> 02:05.780
and in some instances, they may be YouTubers for whom I'll check out their channel

02:05.780 --> 02:07.780
and see if their Twitter's worth keeping up with.

02:07.780 --> 02:11.780
And at some point at the start of the summer, a person by the name of T-Spill followed me.

02:11.780 --> 02:16.780
I checked out their channel, around 15,000 subscribers, not a bad amount going on,

02:17.640 --> 02:20.640
so I thought, you know what, I'll follow them back and see what happens with their channel.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.640
They also had their subscriptions public,

02:22.640 --> 02:24.640
and because I have a bit of a vanity project going on,

02:24.640 --> 02:26.640
I often check my most popular subscribers,

02:26.640 --> 02:28.640
see whose attention I have,

02:28.640 --> 02:30.640
and I noticed they were subscribed to me,

02:30.640 --> 02:32.640
but fairly low down on the pecking order.

02:32.640 --> 02:34.640
However, with every passing week, I noticed them climbing,

02:34.640 --> 02:36.640
gradually and then rapidly ascending,

02:36.640 --> 02:38.640
and I thought to myself,

02:38.640 --> 02:40.640
what on earth is going on?

02:40.640 --> 02:45.640
The channel moved from 15k to 13k to 60k to 150k and so much more.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.500
So this is when I found out all about these people.

02:48.500 --> 02:50.500
And if we were going by T-Spill's thumbnails and titles,

02:50.500 --> 02:54.500
this was a non-stop festival of pure drama.

02:54.500 --> 02:57.500
And to be honest, they looked like people who loved a bit of spice.

02:57.500 --> 03:00.500
So what of this new rise to the top of such individuals?

03:00.500 --> 03:02.500
Well, they're members of what is known as the beauty community.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.500
Now, when you're as good looking as me,

03:04.500 --> 03:06.500
you don't really need any makeup to stay beautiful.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.500
However, as implied, these are a set of creators

03:08.500 --> 03:11.500
who are focused on the testing of commercial beauty products.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.500
But this isn't any old beauty community,

03:14.360 --> 03:16.360
we're not talking about Zoella here.

03:16.360 --> 03:18.360
As interesting as that is, we're talking about a community

03:18.360 --> 03:20.360
that has really popularized the nature of spilling tea

03:20.360 --> 03:22.360
and embodied a culture like no other.

03:22.360 --> 03:24.360
And you'll soon see what I mean.

03:24.360 --> 03:26.360
This sort of content seems to have been performing

03:26.360 --> 03:28.360
fairly successfully for a while.

03:28.360 --> 03:30.360
There are a fair few prominent creators in this community,

03:30.360 --> 03:32.360
one of them being Jeffree Star,

03:32.360 --> 03:34.360
who has a fairly hefty 10 million subscribers.

03:34.360 --> 03:36.360
Not the most,

03:36.360 --> 03:40.360
but he's more well known for his outgoing personality.

03:40.360 --> 03:42.360
As said, there are a load of other prominent figures

03:43.220 --> 03:45.220
in this community, a load of people

03:45.220 --> 03:47.220
who are very interested in that little sass.

03:47.220 --> 03:49.220
With the rise of channels like Teaspill

03:49.220 --> 03:51.220
and other content creators reporting

03:51.220 --> 03:53.220
on the shenanigans of these creators,

03:53.220 --> 03:55.220
it seems there must be a lot to discuss.

03:55.220 --> 03:57.220
And really, the question that I want to answer

03:57.220 --> 03:59.220
at the end of all this is why?

03:59.220 --> 04:01.220
Why do people start caring about the drama

04:01.220 --> 04:03.220
of a community that has been functioning

04:03.220 --> 04:05.220
fairly competently for years prior,

04:05.220 --> 04:07.220
and why should people care?

04:07.220 --> 04:09.220
Or, should people care?

04:09.220 --> 04:11.220
These are all questions that many of us here

04:12.080 --> 04:14.080
ask for today, because honestly,

04:14.080 --> 04:16.080
I'm just as confused as the rest of you.

04:16.080 --> 04:18.080
Why did this

04:18.080 --> 04:20.080
talk to you guys

04:20.080 --> 04:22.080
in this video?

04:22.080 --> 04:24.080
It's been so hard.

04:24.080 --> 04:26.080
Why are you crying?

04:26.080 --> 04:28.080
outdo this.

04:28.080 --> 04:30.080
Tonight's the night!

04:30.080 --> 04:32.080
Despite my grades, I knew I was smart.

04:32.080 --> 04:34.080
Are you a Jake Pauler?

04:34.080 --> 04:36.080
Kiss me with a mouth.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.080
You're my mom.

04:38.080 --> 04:40.080
I thought it was sexy, okay?

04:40.940 --> 04:42.940
I just learned about

04:42.940 --> 04:44.940
their most romantic moments.

04:44.940 --> 04:46.940
I think we need to find out.

04:46.940 --> 04:48.940
But first, as I assume many of you will be

04:48.940 --> 04:50.940
unfamiliar with this, given my audience,

04:50.940 --> 04:52.940
I think we should have a rundown of the drama

04:52.940 --> 04:54.940
and see what everyone's freaking out about.

04:54.940 --> 04:56.940
Courtesy of my field correspondent,

04:56.940 --> 04:58.940
J. Aubrey, or Jorbrey, or whatever,

04:58.940 --> 05:00.940
I never really asked him what his preferred

05:00.940 --> 05:02.940
name was, so I'll just do both.

05:02.940 --> 05:04.940
Fuck the system, take it away,

05:04.940 --> 05:06.940
my good man.

05:07.800 --> 05:09.800
If YouTube were a well-oiled machine,

05:09.800 --> 05:11.800
then it would be fueled purely

05:11.800 --> 05:13.800
by tea. So much so

05:13.800 --> 05:15.800
that you now have entire channels

05:15.800 --> 05:17.800
dedicated to the art form of

05:17.800 --> 05:19.800
spilling tea, keeping you up to speed

05:19.800 --> 05:21.800
on who said what today, who made an

05:21.800 --> 05:23.800
apology this week, who dropped

05:23.800 --> 05:25.800
the n-word five years ago, you know,

05:25.800 --> 05:27.800
the usual. But for someone on the outside

05:27.800 --> 05:29.800
looking in, it can understandably

05:29.800 --> 05:31.800
get a bit messy.

05:31.800 --> 05:33.800
I'm not sure if this is the best

05:33.800 --> 05:35.800
way to explain it, but

05:36.660 --> 05:38.660
it can understandably get a bit messy in some areas.

05:38.660 --> 05:40.660
So let's you and me take a little journey

05:40.660 --> 05:42.660
down the rabbit hole here, as we explore

05:42.660 --> 05:44.660
all the succulent drama that has transpired

05:44.660 --> 05:46.660
in the YouTube beauty community

05:46.660 --> 05:48.660
as of late. If we want to get a clear

05:48.660 --> 05:50.660
picture of this saga in its entirety,

05:50.660 --> 05:52.660
then we need to revert back to the beginning.

05:52.660 --> 05:54.660
The year is 2016, the beauty community

05:54.660 --> 05:56.660
has been popping off for a very considerable

05:56.660 --> 05:58.660
amount of time, with the makeup

05:58.660 --> 06:00.660
guru Heavyweight spearheading the

06:00.660 --> 06:02.660
genre. Manny MUA, Laura Lee,

06:02.660 --> 06:04.660
and Jeffree Star were of the notable

06:04.660 --> 06:06.660
characters involved during this

06:06.660 --> 06:08.660
ethereal era of seemingly never-ending

06:08.660 --> 06:10.660
amity and goodwill.

06:10.660 --> 06:12.660
The three were inseparable, collaborating

06:12.660 --> 06:14.660
and helping each other out without a hint

06:14.660 --> 06:16.660
of hesitation that is until things

06:16.660 --> 06:18.660
got a little bit...odd.

06:18.660 --> 06:20.660
Over time, the trio began to grow

06:20.660 --> 06:22.660
more distant, thus a cold blanket

06:22.660 --> 06:24.660
of uncertainty was soon draped

06:24.660 --> 06:26.660
over the community. These figureheads began

06:26.660 --> 06:28.660
shading one another in the eye of the public,

06:28.660 --> 06:30.660
Jeffree going so far as to take to Snapchat

06:30.660 --> 06:32.660
where he would constantly drivel on about

06:32.660 --> 06:34.660
fake friends and backstabbers,

06:34.660 --> 06:36.660
causing more and more speculation

06:36.660 --> 06:38.660
amongst viewers. What had happened

06:38.660 --> 06:40.660
to this group of creators who were once

06:40.660 --> 06:42.660
so close to one another?

06:42.660 --> 06:44.660
Fast forward to August of 2018, and

06:44.660 --> 06:46.660
Shane's docuseries on Jeffree Star

06:46.660 --> 06:48.660
takes the internet by storm.

06:48.660 --> 06:50.660
Being an incredibly extensive look into the

06:50.660 --> 06:52.660
makeup mogul's lifestyle, it obviously

06:52.660 --> 06:54.660
got a lot of people talking. Not just

06:54.660 --> 06:56.660
audiences, but Star's past acquaintances

06:56.660 --> 06:58.660
as well. Didn't take long

06:58.660 --> 07:00.660
for Gabriel Zamora to post

07:00.660 --> 07:02.660
this picture of him, Nikita

07:02.660 --> 07:04.660
Dragon, Manny, and Laura

07:04.660 --> 07:06.660
flipping the camera off with the especially

07:06.660 --> 07:08.660
spicy caption,

07:08.660 --> 07:10.660
This one tweet

07:10.660 --> 07:12.660
ignited a firestorm overnight

07:12.660 --> 07:14.660
with Gabriel then going on an entire

07:14.660 --> 07:16.660
tangent about how racist Jeffree

07:16.660 --> 07:18.660
happened to be. This led to some digging

07:18.660 --> 07:20.660
into Gabriel's past, and imagine

07:20.660 --> 07:22.660
my shock, Jeffree's fans were quick

07:22.660 --> 07:24.660
to turn the tables. But the disconcerting

07:24.660 --> 07:26.660
comments didn't stop at Gabriel Zamora.

07:26.660 --> 07:28.660
In fact, it seemed like a few other

07:28.660 --> 07:30.660
friends had some interesting opinions

07:30.660 --> 07:32.660
on certain races too.

07:32.660 --> 07:34.660
And soon enough, well, Twitter

07:34.660 --> 07:36.660
did its thing.

07:46.660 --> 07:48.660
Seeing as nearly everyone was exposed for being a massive

07:48.660 --> 07:50.660
hypocrite, the outcry amongst fans began

07:50.660 --> 07:52.660
and well, damage control can only

07:52.660 --> 07:54.660
do so much. In fact, Laura Lee's apology

07:54.660 --> 07:56.660
video was really the nail in her coffin

07:56.660 --> 07:58.660
as her channel began bleeding subs

07:58.660 --> 08:00.660
soon after. Laura Lee is now one of the most

08:00.660 --> 08:02.660
unsubscribed to channels on the entire

08:02.660 --> 08:04.660
website, causing a massive

08:04.660 --> 08:06.660
downfall that forced herself and others

08:06.660 --> 08:08.660
into an extended hiatus.

08:08.660 --> 08:10.660
TLDR, no one really knows what happened

08:10.660 --> 08:12.660
amongst the three, everyone has their own theories

08:12.660 --> 08:14.660
of what could have happened, but it doesn't matter

08:14.660 --> 08:16.660
now because everyone hates them regardless due to

08:16.660 --> 08:18.660
their racist and hypocritical pasts.

08:18.660 --> 08:20.660
Hope that sheds some sort of light onto things.

08:20.660 --> 08:22.660
Now to throw it back to Tro before he slanders

08:22.660 --> 08:24.660
my good name again by calling me

08:24.660 --> 08:26.660
Jabri. I mean, come on man, is it that hard?

08:26.660 --> 08:28.660
There's a space right there. It's right there, right

08:28.660 --> 08:30.660
RIGHT FUCKING THERE!

08:30.660 --> 08:32.660
Wow. One exhilarating

08:32.660 --> 08:34.660
rundown. Now we know why people

08:34.660 --> 08:36.660
care about this so much. I feel like

08:36.660 --> 08:38.660
I've been electrified. The tea is

08:38.660 --> 08:40.660
running through my veins. Please

08:40.660 --> 08:42.660
go and check out my boy,

08:42.660 --> 08:44.660
Jabri. He's a great friend of the channel and

08:44.660 --> 08:46.660
an upcoming creator who's obviously

08:46.660 --> 08:48.660
destined for great things.

08:48.660 --> 08:50.660
So in the last few months, we all started using phrases

08:50.660 --> 08:52.660
to do with tea. Honestly, I didn't

08:52.660 --> 08:54.660
know originally where they were sourced.

08:54.660 --> 08:56.660
I assumed they were from the sassy

08:56.660 --> 08:58.660
talk show hosts because of their respective

08:58.660 --> 09:00.660
gifts. However, I realise now

09:00.660 --> 09:02.660
the beauty community has been using it

09:02.660 --> 09:04.660
long before any of us plebs ever

09:04.660 --> 09:06.660
acknowledged its existence.

09:06.660 --> 09:08.660
I just wanna give you guys a quick little

09:08.660 --> 09:10.660
tea that I

09:10.660 --> 09:12.660
am in a hotel room, so the lighting and sound

09:12.660 --> 09:14.660
is gonna be a little different.

09:14.660 --> 09:16.660
This was 11 months ago, yet the cultural

09:16.660 --> 09:18.660
phenomenon only blessed us recently.

09:18.660 --> 09:20.660
Now of course, this series with

09:20.660 --> 09:22.660
Shane and all the following hijinks

09:22.660 --> 09:24.660
has really been the peak of the drama. However,

09:24.660 --> 09:26.660
it's been building up a while before.

09:26.660 --> 09:28.660
Why did people suddenly start caring?

09:28.660 --> 09:30.660
That's what I want to answer first.

09:30.660 --> 09:32.660
Well, let's first establish one

09:32.660 --> 09:34.660
premise. Every community has drama.

09:34.660 --> 09:36.660
There is no community above

09:36.660 --> 09:38.660
this simple fact. When you have a collective people

09:38.660 --> 09:40.660
sharing in the same genre, you will have conflict.

09:40.660 --> 09:42.660
Even in cases where the community seems

09:42.660 --> 09:44.660
benign, like the animation community,

09:44.660 --> 09:46.660
it is unavoidable. However, drama in

09:46.660 --> 09:48.660
most circumstances is trivial.

09:48.660 --> 09:50.660
Even stuff that people make huge long

09:50.660 --> 09:52.660
videos on won't have a huge impact

09:52.660 --> 09:54.660
in our lives. So what really matters

09:54.660 --> 09:56.660
in whether drama has significance

09:56.660 --> 09:58.660
to people? Well, like everything

09:58.660 --> 10:00.660
is the reaction. I think that's the first

10:00.660 --> 10:02.660
important point to remember. Before

10:02.660 --> 10:04.660
all of these charades, the beauty community

10:04.660 --> 10:06.660
definitely demonstrated the potential for the

10:06.660 --> 10:08.660
sort of quarrels that we've witnessed over the last

10:08.660 --> 10:10.660
few months, and that's mainly because

10:10.660 --> 10:12.660
they're melodramatic people. And this

10:12.660 --> 10:14.660
should surprise no one, because it is a

10:14.660 --> 10:16.660
stereotype, and although I'm not necessarily

10:16.660 --> 10:18.660
fond of stereotypes, when it comes to topics

10:18.660 --> 10:20.660
that are based more on human free will and decision,

10:20.660 --> 10:22.660
it may attract a certain sort of

10:22.660 --> 10:24.660
person, and create a group of people with at least

10:24.660 --> 10:26.660
some overlap in traits.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.660
The people today are very camp,

10:28.660 --> 10:30.660
very expressive, and of course, as mentioned,

10:30.660 --> 10:32.660
very dramatic. So when all of these situations

10:32.660 --> 10:34.660
transpired, it was inevitable that no matter

10:34.660 --> 10:36.660
how negligible these predicaments were,

10:36.660 --> 10:38.660
it was going to cause huge ripples

10:38.660 --> 10:40.660
amongst the community. This is all

10:40.660 --> 10:42.660
worth remembering. The next point to remember

10:42.660 --> 10:44.660
is that just because there was an

10:44.660 --> 10:46.660
absence of reported transgressions,

10:46.660 --> 10:48.660
doesn't mean there was an absence of

10:48.660 --> 10:50.660
transgressions. I've said this all before, and I'll

10:50.660 --> 10:52.660
say it again, without the existence of

10:52.660 --> 10:54.660
commentary, many of these individuals would not

10:54.660 --> 10:56.660
be held to account. And let me tell you,

10:56.660 --> 10:58.660
people like Jeffree Star have been causing drama

10:58.660 --> 11:00.660
for ages. It's just a long time

11:00.660 --> 11:02.660
it had its own realms of existence,

11:02.660 --> 11:04.660
and I highly doubt that before all of the

11:04.660 --> 11:06.660
drama channels documenting it popped up,

11:06.660 --> 11:08.660
that there was just this complete

11:08.660 --> 11:10.660
absence of wrongdoings. In fact,

11:10.660 --> 11:12.660
there are a couple channels who have been up for

11:12.660 --> 11:14.660
a bit longer covering this. That would be

11:14.660 --> 11:16.660
my guess anyway, given how quickly all

11:16.660 --> 11:18.660
of these channels had a backlog of content

11:18.660 --> 11:20.660
when they set up, seems like it was something fairly

11:20.660 --> 11:22.660
endemic before. With all of this drama

11:22.660 --> 11:24.660
suddenly erupting, you might think the beauty community

11:24.660 --> 11:26.660
itself has just blown up in 2018,

11:26.660 --> 11:28.660
and if you didn't watch their content,

11:28.660 --> 11:30.660
you may not have even encountered their channels,

11:30.660 --> 11:32.660
so the naivety is completely understandable.

11:32.660 --> 11:34.660
But the truth of the matter is that many of the people

11:34.660 --> 11:36.660
that we'll be talking about today, Jeffree Star

11:36.660 --> 11:38.660
Laura Lee, have been extremely

11:38.660 --> 11:40.660
successful for the last couple years at least,

11:40.660 --> 11:42.660
and in the last Shane Dawson's little series,

11:42.660 --> 11:44.660
which Star has definitely experienced a spike in stardom,

11:44.660 --> 11:46.660
the drama videos didn't actually cause a huge

11:46.660 --> 11:48.660
impact on the traffic these channels

11:48.660 --> 11:50.660
received, within their own fanbases

11:50.660 --> 11:52.660
at least. However, it has definitely led to

11:52.660 --> 11:54.660
a level of accountability that many of these individuals

11:54.660 --> 11:56.660
were not accustomed to. But if the beauty

11:56.660 --> 11:58.660
community aren't exactly experiencing

11:58.660 --> 12:00.660
exponential growth, why is there this influx

12:00.660 --> 12:02.660
of reported drama? So there are a

12:02.660 --> 12:04.660
few things that I believe are worth documenting

12:04.660 --> 12:06.660
here. The beauty community, as I said,

12:06.660 --> 12:08.660
has always had drama, that's important,

12:08.660 --> 12:10.660
it was fairly run-the-mill TMZ-level

12:10.660 --> 12:12.660
stuff, but it was almost an accessory to

12:12.660 --> 12:14.660
the channels. A bit of tea here and there

12:14.660 --> 12:16.660
was normal. This changed for a plethora

12:16.660 --> 12:18.660
of reasons. As I said, the increase of

12:18.660 --> 12:20.660
these drama channels definitely generated a

12:20.660 --> 12:22.660
new level of scrutiny onto these creators.

12:22.660 --> 12:24.660
But on top of this, why did the beauty channel

12:24.660 --> 12:26.660
drama appear to take over from individuals

12:26.660 --> 12:28.660
like Jake and Logan Paul? And I'm not

12:28.660 --> 12:30.660
saying they didn't have any drama, they

12:30.660 --> 12:32.660
had their boxing match, but no one seems to have the

12:32.660 --> 12:34.660
ability to quote, expose them anymore.

12:34.660 --> 12:36.660
Even the boxing match wasn't a particularly

12:36.660 --> 12:38.660
profitable trending topic for many YouTubers.

12:38.660 --> 12:40.660
Well, we have to go back to January to

12:40.660 --> 12:42.660
understand that, back to an event which, as

12:42.660 --> 12:44.660
mentioned earlier, was a defining moment

12:44.660 --> 12:46.660
for many creators, which was Logan

12:46.660 --> 12:48.660
Paul's little excursion. Now, the

12:48.660 --> 12:50.660
whole situation was disastrous for him, yet

12:50.660 --> 12:52.660
at the same time, in hindsight, although

12:52.660 --> 12:54.660
he's not experiencing the views that he

12:54.660 --> 12:56.660
was at the peak of his fame, Logan Paul

12:56.660 --> 12:58.660
and his brother Jake are experiencing

12:58.660 --> 13:00.660
considerable success, minus the criticism,

13:00.660 --> 13:02.660
which is a pretty sound combination,

13:02.660 --> 13:04.660
because although some may argue that any

13:04.660 --> 13:06.660
press is good press, not having YouTube

13:06.660 --> 13:08.660
at your throat is pretty great.

13:08.660 --> 13:10.660
But why did people just lay off?

13:10.660 --> 13:12.660
To understand this, we have to ask

13:12.660 --> 13:14.660
ourselves, how are people being

13:14.660 --> 13:16.660
exposed? Well, some may say, when

13:16.660 --> 13:18.660
you do something bad.

13:18.660 --> 13:20.660
But I disagree. Someone being

13:20.660 --> 13:22.660
exposed is when they're shown as doing something

13:22.660 --> 13:24.660
bad for their own standards, and because

13:24.660 --> 13:26.660
Logan Paul set the bar so low

13:26.660 --> 13:28.660
with his behaviour, he eventually fell out

13:28.660 --> 13:30.660
of interest, because videos documenting

13:30.660 --> 13:32.660
his questionable actions no longer became

13:32.660 --> 13:34.660
questionable for him. The views

13:34.660 --> 13:36.660
fell out, and even though the Paul brothers

13:36.660 --> 13:38.660
are arguably just as egregious as

13:38.660 --> 13:40.660
before, no one seems to care

13:40.660 --> 13:42.660
anymore. Commentators who covered

13:42.660 --> 13:44.660
these topics, realising the subject was

13:44.660 --> 13:46.660
kinda dead, then moved in two different ways.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.660
They either went to more nuanced

13:48.660 --> 13:50.660
commentary, covering topics that were

13:50.660 --> 13:52.660
more timeless, or they went into the whole

13:52.660 --> 13:54.660
reaction commentary trend, which was just emerging

13:54.660 --> 13:56.660
from a very obsessive Dr. Phil phase.

13:56.660 --> 13:58.660
However, not all audiences were

13:58.660 --> 14:00.660
interested in that. They're not the same

14:00.660 --> 14:02.660
genres, after all. Some people still want

14:02.660 --> 14:04.660
to see YouTubers being held to account for

14:04.660 --> 14:06.660
misconduct. This meant there was almost a

14:06.660 --> 14:08.660
leftover audience vying for some sort of

14:08.660 --> 14:10.660
drama, and here they had huge potential

14:10.660 --> 14:12.660
for it. And this is where this

14:12.660 --> 14:14.660
little community of people was almost

14:14.660 --> 14:16.660
roped into this culture, without their

14:16.660 --> 14:18.660
consent, and it was almost custom-made.

14:18.660 --> 14:20.660
Their naturally sassy personalities made

14:20.660 --> 14:22.660
their reactions almost priceless. They had

14:22.660 --> 14:24.660
an audience that was equally susceptible to

14:24.660 --> 14:26.660
being engaged in drama, they had these personas

14:26.660 --> 14:28.660
that were built on the foundations of being

14:28.660 --> 14:30.660
friendly, smiley, to the audience,

14:30.660 --> 14:32.660
and as an audience, your perception of

14:32.660 --> 14:34.660
these people was very precious. They need

14:34.660 --> 14:36.660
to trust these guys when they're going out

14:36.660 --> 14:38.660
to buy their brands. Being a judge is

14:38.660 --> 14:40.660
a role that is built on trust,

14:40.660 --> 14:42.660
and moving away from just beauty products

14:42.660 --> 14:44.660
gave greater potential for this situation.

14:44.660 --> 14:46.660
In fact, I'd argue the relationship

14:46.660 --> 14:48.660
that beauty gurus perpetuate

14:48.660 --> 14:50.660
is even deeper than any genre discussed

14:50.660 --> 14:52.660
on this channel before. They open up about

14:52.660 --> 14:54.660
a lot, in very emotional ways,

14:54.660 --> 14:56.660
which is great, but it also means there is a

14:56.660 --> 14:58.660
level of consistency that they will be

14:58.660 --> 15:00.660
held to account on, and with a

15:00.660 --> 15:02.660
community, there will always be some people

15:02.660 --> 15:04.660
who don't have genuine personas, and

15:04.660 --> 15:06.660
exaggerate or fabricate to try and win over

15:06.660 --> 15:08.660
audiences. So when the drama scene

15:08.660 --> 15:10.660
burst through the door, dying to cover this,

15:10.660 --> 15:12.660
it was going to be raucous, because the

15:12.660 --> 15:14.660
community is a breeding ground for

15:14.660 --> 15:16.660
factions and drama. You had

15:16.660 --> 15:18.660
a load of volatile individuals who are

15:18.660 --> 15:20.660
sassy as hell, and yet, at the same time,

15:20.660 --> 15:22.660
love to share a unique relationship

15:22.660 --> 15:24.660
with the audience. However, what we have

15:24.660 --> 15:26.660
explained was how the market opened up

15:26.660 --> 15:28.660
for these individuals, but why did everything

15:28.660 --> 15:30.660
erupt as perfectly as it did?

15:40.660 --> 15:42.660
So, I was doing my research, and I noticed

15:42.660 --> 15:44.660
a trend. A lot of these drama

15:44.660 --> 15:46.660
channels who were covering it were sourced

15:46.660 --> 15:48.660
approximately a year ago, when some of them

15:48.660 --> 15:50.660
were doing this thing where they would select a clip

15:50.660 --> 15:52.660
and edit it in a way.

15:54.660 --> 16:02.660
In fact, many of them popped up in the window

16:02.660 --> 16:04.660
over a couple months, which is very intriguing

16:04.660 --> 16:06.660
in itself, as although it's natural

16:06.660 --> 16:08.660
for people to create channels covering

16:08.660 --> 16:10.660
something when it's doing relatively

16:10.660 --> 16:12.660
well, there was no clear motive in this

16:12.660 --> 16:14.660
instance that would exactly warrant it.

16:14.660 --> 16:16.660
But whatever, I don't think anything shady

16:16.660 --> 16:18.660
is going on, so who cares? Many of these

16:18.660 --> 16:20.660
channels then diverged in different

16:20.660 --> 16:22.660
directions, realising that there was clearly

16:22.660 --> 16:24.660
a lot more to do, but all while enabling

16:24.660 --> 16:26.660
these foundations, and as a lot of the other drama

16:26.660 --> 16:28.660
became stale to audiences, there was

16:28.660 --> 16:30.660
almost just a slight enough bridge from

16:30.660 --> 16:32.660
what we've seen, like the Paul brothers,

16:32.660 --> 16:34.660
to this community. Arguably,

16:34.660 --> 16:36.660
that bridge was paved by creators such as

16:36.660 --> 16:38.660
Tana Mongeau and Shane Dawson, who had

16:38.660 --> 16:40.660
both roots in commentary and beauty,

16:40.660 --> 16:42.660
although themselves being rather independent.

16:42.660 --> 16:44.660
This probably lent some algorithmic

16:44.660 --> 16:46.660
purpose to permit the sort of

16:46.660 --> 16:48.660
sass that we've observed of recent. All of

16:48.660 --> 16:50.660
these channels are also very well organised

16:50.660 --> 16:52.660
with the sort of content they're creating, in fact

16:52.660 --> 16:54.660
some of them seem pretty synchronised with

16:54.660 --> 16:56.660
their narrative. For example, Teaspill and

16:56.660 --> 16:58.660
HereForTheTea, at the time of writing this,

16:58.660 --> 17:00.660
released trailers for their Jaclyn Hill collab,

17:00.660 --> 17:02.660
and the trailers were identical. Now this

17:02.660 --> 17:04.660
next part is conjecture, however I feel

17:04.660 --> 17:06.660
it is fairly well grounded. A lot of these creators

17:06.660 --> 17:08.660
in the past year have been branching out

17:08.660 --> 17:10.660
their personas, they've been doing more personal

17:10.660 --> 17:12.660
videos, I can't exactly say why,

17:12.660 --> 17:14.660
but if I were to theorise, I'd say that due

17:14.660 --> 17:16.660
to the influx of more scrutiny

17:16.660 --> 17:18.660
from channels that are attempting to analyse

17:18.660 --> 17:20.660
their appeal, they try and create a

17:20.660 --> 17:22.660
third dimension, they try and introduce

17:22.660 --> 17:24.660
another facet to their character that is

17:24.660 --> 17:26.660
more than just makeup, after all, anyone

17:26.660 --> 17:28.660
has access to makeup, anyone can

17:28.660 --> 17:30.660
criticise it, anyone can criticise your

17:30.660 --> 17:32.660
own brands, even. People can judge

17:32.660 --> 17:34.660
it. What they can't necessarily contradict

17:34.660 --> 17:36.660
is your character, and eventually this led

17:36.660 --> 17:38.660
to everyone using deep stories to try and

17:38.660 --> 17:40.660
elevate the perception their audience has

17:40.660 --> 17:42.660
of them, and then when other people witnessed

17:42.660 --> 17:44.660
this, they realised they had to compete in this

17:44.660 --> 17:46.660
market as well, and eventually created

17:46.660 --> 17:48.660
a new culture of deep opening up

17:48.660 --> 17:50.660
emotional videos.

18:02.660 --> 18:04.660
But equally this meant that their persona was

18:04.660 --> 18:06.660
no longer a simple, sassy element of a channel

18:06.660 --> 18:08.660
who could become involved in drama,

18:08.660 --> 18:10.660
it became an issue of actual standards.

18:10.660 --> 18:12.660
But the bigger they are, the harder they

18:12.660 --> 18:14.660
fall, and when the whole situation surrounding

18:14.660 --> 18:16.660
Jeffree Star, digging up the racist comments

18:16.660 --> 18:18.660
from years ago because they didn't like what he was

18:18.660 --> 18:20.660
doing now, it was a perfect example of

18:20.660 --> 18:22.660
when someone's own perception of self

18:22.660 --> 18:24.660
becomes over inflated, and they do

18:24.660 --> 18:26.660
something fucking stupid, which it was,

18:26.660 --> 18:28.660
and in a way, what many of these people

18:28.660 --> 18:30.660
had said in the past years were not

18:30.660 --> 18:32.660
any worse than what Jeffree Star said,

18:32.660 --> 18:34.660
but what really got them were their own crafted

18:34.660 --> 18:36.660
narratives. Firstly, they centred themselves

18:36.660 --> 18:38.660
as this bastion, then they created

18:38.660 --> 18:40.660
an implicit law which told their audience

18:40.660 --> 18:42.660
if you've made racist tweets in the

18:42.660 --> 18:44.660
past, then you should not be supported,

18:44.660 --> 18:46.660
which is subjective, and

18:46.660 --> 18:48.660
many people, justifiably, don't agree

18:48.660 --> 18:50.660
to it, but it is subjective, and that's

18:50.660 --> 18:52.660
important. However, another implicit

18:52.660 --> 18:54.660
law that is pretty universally applied

18:54.660 --> 18:56.660
that is almost assumed, is that you would

18:56.660 --> 18:58.660
apply the standards that you apply to other

18:58.660 --> 19:00.660
people onto yourself. So when it was

19:00.660 --> 19:02.660
revealed that many of the individuals attempting

19:02.660 --> 19:04.660
to bury poor old, or rich

19:04.660 --> 19:06.660
old, or rich young Jeffree Star

19:06.660 --> 19:08.660
over here, had also posted some

19:08.660 --> 19:10.660
fairly questionable content, it essentially

19:10.660 --> 19:12.660
completely backfired, and when their

19:12.660 --> 19:14.660
authenticity was really put in question,

19:14.660 --> 19:16.660
when they had to make everyone's favourite

19:16.660 --> 19:18.660
sincere apology video, it all

19:18.660 --> 19:20.660
fell down for a few of them. Many people

19:20.660 --> 19:22.660
who've dealt with audiences and their judgement

19:22.660 --> 19:24.660
know that they care much more for the

19:24.660 --> 19:26.660
context of what it says about a character

19:26.660 --> 19:28.660
than just barebones, heat of the moment

19:28.660 --> 19:30.660
reactions.

19:30.660 --> 19:40.660
None of these beauty gurus were really

19:40.660 --> 19:42.660
perceptive enough to gauge that, their

19:42.660 --> 19:44.660
engagement with these topics was elementary

19:44.660 --> 19:46.660
and they paid the ultimate price,

19:46.660 --> 19:48.660
and it hit them hard. We're talking

19:48.660 --> 19:50.660
content cop level hard, their

19:50.660 --> 19:52.660
subscribers punished them, because

19:52.660 --> 19:54.660
there was this image, completely shattered,

19:54.660 --> 19:56.660
which had only been made worse by the

19:56.660 --> 19:58.660
fact that they'd attempted to embellish this

19:58.660 --> 20:00.660
in the months prior, and that's what this all

20:00.660 --> 20:02.660
represents, the perfect storm, this was

20:02.660 --> 20:04.660
the perfect type of place for commentary

20:04.660 --> 20:06.660
to settle for the summer, and for some

20:06.660 --> 20:08.660
audiences too, because while Jake

20:08.660 --> 20:10.660
and Logan were arguably behaving much

20:10.660 --> 20:12.660
worse, people much more love to hear about the other

20:12.660 --> 20:14.660
side of a person, that's where the whole

20:14.660 --> 20:16.660
exposed term comes from,

20:16.660 --> 20:18.660
and with the cultivation of all these drama channels

20:18.660 --> 20:20.660
that really relished in the algorithmic

20:20.660 --> 20:22.660
cycles to drive home this notion, it

20:22.660 --> 20:24.660
all cultivated an environment for it to

20:24.660 --> 20:26.660
take the place of the previous generation

20:26.660 --> 20:28.660
of drama, drama is natural,

20:28.660 --> 20:30.660
drama is organic, in many ways drama

20:30.660 --> 20:32.660
is expected, because drama will yield from

20:32.660 --> 20:34.660
conflict, and conflict happens when you interact

20:34.660 --> 20:36.660
with other human beings, and honestly if there

20:36.660 --> 20:38.660
wasn't any drama, you'd feel like it was a bit

20:38.660 --> 20:40.660
insincere, at the same time

20:40.660 --> 20:42.660
forcing drama will naturally make you

20:42.660 --> 20:44.660
susceptible to being labelled as an

20:44.660 --> 20:46.660
instigator, something equally unpopular

20:46.660 --> 20:48.660
with an audience, but that's what these movements

20:48.660 --> 20:50.660
represent, a change in position,

20:50.660 --> 20:52.660
that's what drama does, if you don't

20:52.660 --> 20:54.660
come out of drama at least thinking differently

20:54.660 --> 20:56.660
of one of the people involved, then

20:56.660 --> 20:58.660
chances are the tea was a tad cold,

20:58.660 --> 21:00.660
for some reason, drama in the beauty

21:00.660 --> 21:02.660
community, as seemingly obvious as it should

21:02.660 --> 21:04.660
be, was ignored by many for the reasons

21:04.660 --> 21:06.660
that I believe many perceived it as too

21:06.660 --> 21:08.660
tabloid, drama was an accessory

21:08.660 --> 21:10.660
as I said, however as the creators

21:10.660 --> 21:12.660
in it sought to increase their social

21:12.660 --> 21:14.660
standing and character depth, it gave those

21:14.660 --> 21:16.660
on the outside more to chew on, and

21:16.660 --> 21:18.660
more to judge, and through the facilitation

21:18.660 --> 21:20.660
by other creators, the drama of the

21:20.660 --> 21:22.660
beauty community quickly spread,

21:22.660 --> 21:24.660
and we ended up here, with it arguably

21:24.660 --> 21:26.660
being the most viewed drama of the

21:26.660 --> 21:28.660
summer, and many of you, like me, probably

21:28.660 --> 21:30.660
didn't even know about it. So

21:30.660 --> 21:32.660
what for the future? I think it's difficult to

21:32.660 --> 21:34.660
exactly say how long this will persist

21:34.660 --> 21:36.660
as said drama is typically perpetuated

21:36.660 --> 21:38.660
through the shifting perception between

21:38.660 --> 21:40.660
viewer and creator, this is more possible

21:40.660 --> 21:42.660
when there are more ways for a person's image

21:42.660 --> 21:44.660
to be shifted, which is why a heavy

21:44.660 --> 21:46.660
incident can equally kill potential for drama

21:46.660 --> 21:48.660
as it may stimulate it, it appears

21:48.660 --> 21:50.660
we may have had that huge drama,

21:50.660 --> 21:52.660
though in the grand scheme of things

21:52.660 --> 21:54.660
it's fairly inconsequential, so

21:54.660 --> 21:56.660
there's definitely room for it to manifest,

21:56.660 --> 21:58.660
the simple fact of the matter is that we

21:58.660 --> 22:00.660
viewers like to think that we are holding people

22:00.660 --> 22:02.660
to a moral standard, and we are to an extent,

22:02.660 --> 22:04.660
but we have two sets of standards,

22:04.660 --> 22:06.660
what is acceptable to

22:06.660 --> 22:08.660
society, and what is acceptable

22:08.660 --> 22:10.660
for a person or a community.

22:10.660 --> 22:12.660
Now all of this drama is quite small in the grand

22:12.660 --> 22:14.660
scheme of society, it doesn't change our

22:14.660 --> 22:16.660
lives, Laura Lee hasn't gone out and

22:16.660 --> 22:18.660
assaulted anyone, she's just been a bit of a

22:18.660 --> 22:20.660
dick, but audiences haven't gravitated

22:20.660 --> 22:22.660
to this group of people because

22:22.660 --> 22:24.660
anything particularly egregious is going on,

22:24.660 --> 22:26.660
it's just a new set of fresh

22:26.660 --> 22:28.660
meat for us to get our kicks out of,

22:28.660 --> 22:30.660
because they see themselves as

22:30.660 --> 22:32.660
gurus, and we love to topple

22:32.660 --> 22:34.660
people, when it comes to drama, it's

22:34.660 --> 22:36.660
a fair weather morality, a set of dramatic

22:36.660 --> 22:38.660
people with dramatic audiences

22:38.660 --> 22:40.660
in dramatic situations, trying

22:40.660 --> 22:42.660
to be moral dictators,

22:42.660 --> 22:44.660
but once you become the dictator, the

22:44.660 --> 22:46.660
only way is down, and

22:46.660 --> 22:48.660
that's the tea my friends, that's

22:48.660 --> 22:50.660
the fucking tea, see

22:50.660 --> 22:52.660
I said it.

23:02.660 --> 23:04.660
I want to thank two people

23:04.660 --> 23:06.660
with regards to the creation of this video,

23:06.660 --> 23:08.660
firstly, J Aubrey, J Aubrey,

23:08.660 --> 23:10.660
whatever you wanna bloody call him,

23:10.660 --> 23:12.660
for his absolutely barnstorming

23:12.660 --> 23:14.660
part, he's a great creator, check him out

23:14.660 --> 23:16.660
as I said, and secondly, T Spill herself

23:16.660 --> 23:18.660
for checking my scripts with regards to

23:18.660 --> 23:20.660
the topic and making sure the information

23:20.660 --> 23:22.660
I was basing my judgements off was

23:22.660 --> 23:24.660
accurate, I think that's one of the key

23:24.660 --> 23:26.660
elements of a creator, I'd also like to give

23:26.660 --> 23:28.660
a massive thanks to the editors, who once again,

23:28.660 --> 23:30.660
fantastic work, great job,

23:30.660 --> 23:32.660
definitely check them out, some of these guys

23:32.660 --> 23:34.660
are really up there with the best,

23:34.660 --> 23:36.660
and they will inevitably do

23:36.660 --> 23:38.660
great things with their lives, so definitely go and

23:38.660 --> 23:40.660
send them some love, because without them,

23:40.660 --> 23:42.660
the channel would not be here. Anyhow, I don't think I have

23:42.660 --> 23:44.660
too much else to say, I'd love to hear your thoughts

23:44.660 --> 23:46.660
on the topic, even though I feel like

23:46.660 --> 23:48.660
this is probably something slightly more

23:48.660 --> 23:50.660
unfamiliar with my audiences, so if

23:50.660 --> 23:52.660
this is your first encounter with it, then

23:52.660 --> 23:54.660
honestly, I'd really like to hear your thoughts too actually,

23:54.660 --> 23:56.660
because, you know, first impressions

23:56.660 --> 23:58.660
mean a lot. If this is your first

23:58.660 --> 24:00.660
impression with me, I hope it was a good one too,

24:00.660 --> 24:02.660
if not, well, I'll try and work on that in the future.

24:02.660 --> 24:04.660
Also, if you wanna reach me on Twitter,

24:04.660 --> 24:06.660
at TheRightOpinion, as I said earlier,

24:06.660 --> 24:08.660
Facebook, I use that too, though I haven't used it

24:08.660 --> 24:10.660
as much recently, Discord, another thing

24:10.660 --> 24:12.660
that I love to involve myself in.

24:12.660 --> 24:14.660
All those mediums you can reach me on.

24:14.660 --> 24:16.660
I'm an accessible man, even though I do

24:16.660 --> 24:18.660
tend to be very busy, so

24:18.660 --> 24:20.660
apologies if replies aren't immediate.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.660
Anyhow, until the next one,

24:22.660 --> 24:24.660
I'm TheRightOpinion, and I'll see you then.

24:40.660 --> 24:42.660
Thanks for watching!
