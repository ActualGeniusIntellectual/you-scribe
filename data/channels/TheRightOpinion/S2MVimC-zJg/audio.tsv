0	5860	Summer, 2017. Who can forget.
5860	9860	It's everyday bro.
9860	14860	Do you want to jump in?
14860	15860	Absolute mayhem.
15860	20860	I'm out of fire right now? She just punched me.
20860	25340	Winter. An unrivalled nightmare.
26200	30200	I'm literally stuck here. There's lines of cars starting with that giant truck.
36200	41200	Careers were launched, reputations were established, and people were once again
41200	45200	falling head over heels for drama that seemed so inconsequential in many of our lives.
45200	49200	Summer 18 was around the corner, and many were anticipating the shenanigans
49200	52200	that all of these characters would be caught up in, or at least we thought we were.
53060	57060	Because as the holidays dawned, there was a distinct lack of interest.
57060	61060	In fact, fellow YouTuber NerdCity released a video in which he documented
61060	65060	all of Jake Paul's antics over the summer, antics that were arguably much worse
65060	68060	than anything originally documented in 2017.
68060	72060	And yet, if it hadn't been for some very ruthless marketing, in spite of its excellency,
72060	75060	it probably wouldn't have even reached its current view count.
75060	80060	700,000, not bad, but hardly the peaks of the drama over the previous year.
80920	84920	So, the only question on our lips is, where had all the views gone?
84920	86920	Here on my channel, I talk about beauty.
86920	91920	I want to talk to you guys in this video, it's been so long.
91920	93920	What's up everybody?
93920	95920	My name is Manny Amiwe for those of you who might not know who I am.
95920	97920	Well.
103920	105920	Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Right Opinion,
105920	107920	the home of a twat with too much free time,
108780	110780	and I think it's time for a story.
110780	112780	I think we've had enough of those sorts of story times for now.
112780	117780	Anyhow, I have a Twitter, and like most people with a Twitter, I follow people.
117780	122780	When people follow me, I typically check out their account to see what sort of individuals I'm appealing to,
122780	125780	and in some instances, they may be YouTubers for whom I'll check out their channel
125780	127780	and see if their Twitter's worth keeping up with.
127780	131780	And at some point at the start of the summer, a person by the name of T-Spill followed me.
131780	136780	I checked out their channel, around 15,000 subscribers, not a bad amount going on,
137640	140640	so I thought, you know what, I'll follow them back and see what happens with their channel.
140640	142640	They also had their subscriptions public,
142640	144640	and because I have a bit of a vanity project going on,
144640	146640	I often check my most popular subscribers,
146640	148640	see whose attention I have,
148640	150640	and I noticed they were subscribed to me,
150640	152640	but fairly low down on the pecking order.
152640	154640	However, with every passing week, I noticed them climbing,
154640	156640	gradually and then rapidly ascending,
156640	158640	and I thought to myself,
158640	160640	what on earth is going on?
160640	165640	The channel moved from 15k to 13k to 60k to 150k and so much more.
166500	168500	So this is when I found out all about these people.
168500	170500	And if we were going by T-Spill's thumbnails and titles,
170500	174500	this was a non-stop festival of pure drama.
174500	177500	And to be honest, they looked like people who loved a bit of spice.
177500	180500	So what of this new rise to the top of such individuals?
180500	182500	Well, they're members of what is known as the beauty community.
182500	184500	Now, when you're as good looking as me,
184500	186500	you don't really need any makeup to stay beautiful.
186500	188500	However, as implied, these are a set of creators
188500	191500	who are focused on the testing of commercial beauty products.
191500	193500	But this isn't any old beauty community,
194360	196360	we're not talking about Zoella here.
196360	198360	As interesting as that is, we're talking about a community
198360	200360	that has really popularized the nature of spilling tea
200360	202360	and embodied a culture like no other.
202360	204360	And you'll soon see what I mean.
204360	206360	This sort of content seems to have been performing
206360	208360	fairly successfully for a while.
208360	210360	There are a fair few prominent creators in this community,
210360	212360	one of them being Jeffree Star,
212360	214360	who has a fairly hefty 10 million subscribers.
214360	216360	Not the most,
216360	220360	but he's more well known for his outgoing personality.
220360	222360	As said, there are a load of other prominent figures
223220	225220	in this community, a load of people
225220	227220	who are very interested in that little sass.
227220	229220	With the rise of channels like Teaspill
229220	231220	and other content creators reporting
231220	233220	on the shenanigans of these creators,
233220	235220	it seems there must be a lot to discuss.
235220	237220	And really, the question that I want to answer
237220	239220	at the end of all this is why?
239220	241220	Why do people start caring about the drama
241220	243220	of a community that has been functioning
243220	245220	fairly competently for years prior,
245220	247220	and why should people care?
247220	249220	Or, should people care?
249220	251220	These are all questions that many of us here
252080	254080	ask for today, because honestly,
254080	256080	I'm just as confused as the rest of you.
256080	258080	Why did this
258080	260080	talk to you guys
260080	262080	in this video?
262080	264080	It's been so hard.
264080	266080	Why are you crying?
266080	268080	outdo this.
268080	270080	Tonight's the night!
270080	272080	Despite my grades, I knew I was smart.
272080	274080	Are you a Jake Pauler?
274080	276080	Kiss me with a mouth.
276080	278080	You're my mom.
278080	280080	I thought it was sexy, okay?
280940	282940	I just learned about
282940	284940	their most romantic moments.
284940	286940	I think we need to find out.
286940	288940	But first, as I assume many of you will be
288940	290940	unfamiliar with this, given my audience,
290940	292940	I think we should have a rundown of the drama
292940	294940	and see what everyone's freaking out about.
294940	296940	Courtesy of my field correspondent,
296940	298940	J. Aubrey, or Jorbrey, or whatever,
298940	300940	I never really asked him what his preferred
300940	302940	name was, so I'll just do both.
302940	304940	Fuck the system, take it away,
304940	306940	my good man.
307800	309800	If YouTube were a well-oiled machine,
309800	311800	then it would be fueled purely
311800	313800	by tea. So much so
313800	315800	that you now have entire channels
315800	317800	dedicated to the art form of
317800	319800	spilling tea, keeping you up to speed
319800	321800	on who said what today, who made an
321800	323800	apology this week, who dropped
323800	325800	the n-word five years ago, you know,
325800	327800	the usual. But for someone on the outside
327800	329800	looking in, it can understandably
329800	331800	get a bit messy.
331800	333800	I'm not sure if this is the best
333800	335800	way to explain it, but
336660	338660	it can understandably get a bit messy in some areas.
338660	340660	So let's you and me take a little journey
340660	342660	down the rabbit hole here, as we explore
342660	344660	all the succulent drama that has transpired
344660	346660	in the YouTube beauty community
346660	348660	as of late. If we want to get a clear
348660	350660	picture of this saga in its entirety,
350660	352660	then we need to revert back to the beginning.
352660	354660	The year is 2016, the beauty community
354660	356660	has been popping off for a very considerable
356660	358660	amount of time, with the makeup
358660	360660	guru Heavyweight spearheading the
360660	362660	genre. Manny MUA, Laura Lee,
362660	364660	and Jeffree Star were of the notable
364660	366660	characters involved during this
366660	368660	ethereal era of seemingly never-ending
368660	370660	amity and goodwill.
370660	372660	The three were inseparable, collaborating
372660	374660	and helping each other out without a hint
374660	376660	of hesitation that is until things
376660	378660	got a little bit...odd.
378660	380660	Over time, the trio began to grow
380660	382660	more distant, thus a cold blanket
382660	384660	of uncertainty was soon draped
384660	386660	over the community. These figureheads began
386660	388660	shading one another in the eye of the public,
388660	390660	Jeffree going so far as to take to Snapchat
390660	392660	where he would constantly drivel on about
392660	394660	fake friends and backstabbers,
394660	396660	causing more and more speculation
396660	398660	amongst viewers. What had happened
398660	400660	to this group of creators who were once
400660	402660	so close to one another?
402660	404660	Fast forward to August of 2018, and
404660	406660	Shane's docuseries on Jeffree Star
406660	408660	takes the internet by storm.
408660	410660	Being an incredibly extensive look into the
410660	412660	makeup mogul's lifestyle, it obviously
412660	414660	got a lot of people talking. Not just
414660	416660	audiences, but Star's past acquaintances
416660	418660	as well. Didn't take long
418660	420660	for Gabriel Zamora to post
420660	422660	this picture of him, Nikita
422660	424660	Dragon, Manny, and Laura
424660	426660	flipping the camera off with the especially
426660	428660	spicy caption,
428660	430660	This one tweet
430660	432660	ignited a firestorm overnight
432660	434660	with Gabriel then going on an entire
434660	436660	tangent about how racist Jeffree
436660	438660	happened to be. This led to some digging
438660	440660	into Gabriel's past, and imagine
440660	442660	my shock, Jeffree's fans were quick
442660	444660	to turn the tables. But the disconcerting
444660	446660	comments didn't stop at Gabriel Zamora.
446660	448660	In fact, it seemed like a few other
448660	450660	friends had some interesting opinions
450660	452660	on certain races too.
452660	454660	And soon enough, well, Twitter
454660	456660	did its thing.
466660	468660	Seeing as nearly everyone was exposed for being a massive
468660	470660	hypocrite, the outcry amongst fans began
470660	472660	and well, damage control can only
472660	474660	do so much. In fact, Laura Lee's apology
474660	476660	video was really the nail in her coffin
476660	478660	as her channel began bleeding subs
478660	480660	soon after. Laura Lee is now one of the most
480660	482660	unsubscribed to channels on the entire
482660	484660	website, causing a massive
484660	486660	downfall that forced herself and others
486660	488660	into an extended hiatus.
488660	490660	TLDR, no one really knows what happened
490660	492660	amongst the three, everyone has their own theories
492660	494660	of what could have happened, but it doesn't matter
494660	496660	now because everyone hates them regardless due to
496660	498660	their racist and hypocritical pasts.
498660	500660	Hope that sheds some sort of light onto things.
500660	502660	Now to throw it back to Tro before he slanders
502660	504660	my good name again by calling me
504660	506660	Jabri. I mean, come on man, is it that hard?
506660	508660	There's a space right there. It's right there, right
508660	510660	RIGHT FUCKING THERE!
510660	512660	Wow. One exhilarating
512660	514660	rundown. Now we know why people
514660	516660	care about this so much. I feel like
516660	518660	I've been electrified. The tea is
518660	520660	running through my veins. Please
520660	522660	go and check out my boy,
522660	524660	Jabri. He's a great friend of the channel and
524660	526660	an upcoming creator who's obviously
526660	528660	destined for great things.
528660	530660	So in the last few months, we all started using phrases
530660	532660	to do with tea. Honestly, I didn't
532660	534660	know originally where they were sourced.
534660	536660	I assumed they were from the sassy
536660	538660	talk show hosts because of their respective
538660	540660	gifts. However, I realise now
540660	542660	the beauty community has been using it
542660	544660	long before any of us plebs ever
544660	546660	acknowledged its existence.
546660	548660	I just wanna give you guys a quick little
548660	550660	tea that I
550660	552660	am in a hotel room, so the lighting and sound
552660	554660	is gonna be a little different.
554660	556660	This was 11 months ago, yet the cultural
556660	558660	phenomenon only blessed us recently.
558660	560660	Now of course, this series with
560660	562660	Shane and all the following hijinks
562660	564660	has really been the peak of the drama. However,
564660	566660	it's been building up a while before.
566660	568660	Why did people suddenly start caring?
568660	570660	That's what I want to answer first.
570660	572660	Well, let's first establish one
572660	574660	premise. Every community has drama.
574660	576660	There is no community above
576660	578660	this simple fact. When you have a collective people
578660	580660	sharing in the same genre, you will have conflict.
580660	582660	Even in cases where the community seems
582660	584660	benign, like the animation community,
584660	586660	it is unavoidable. However, drama in
586660	588660	most circumstances is trivial.
588660	590660	Even stuff that people make huge long
590660	592660	videos on won't have a huge impact
592660	594660	in our lives. So what really matters
594660	596660	in whether drama has significance
596660	598660	to people? Well, like everything
598660	600660	is the reaction. I think that's the first
600660	602660	important point to remember. Before
602660	604660	all of these charades, the beauty community
604660	606660	definitely demonstrated the potential for the
606660	608660	sort of quarrels that we've witnessed over the last
608660	610660	few months, and that's mainly because
610660	612660	they're melodramatic people. And this
612660	614660	should surprise no one, because it is a
614660	616660	stereotype, and although I'm not necessarily
616660	618660	fond of stereotypes, when it comes to topics
618660	620660	that are based more on human free will and decision,
620660	622660	it may attract a certain sort of
622660	624660	person, and create a group of people with at least
624660	626660	some overlap in traits.
626660	628660	The people today are very camp,
628660	630660	very expressive, and of course, as mentioned,
630660	632660	very dramatic. So when all of these situations
632660	634660	transpired, it was inevitable that no matter
634660	636660	how negligible these predicaments were,
636660	638660	it was going to cause huge ripples
638660	640660	amongst the community. This is all
640660	642660	worth remembering. The next point to remember
642660	644660	is that just because there was an
644660	646660	absence of reported transgressions,
646660	648660	doesn't mean there was an absence of
648660	650660	transgressions. I've said this all before, and I'll
650660	652660	say it again, without the existence of
652660	654660	commentary, many of these individuals would not
654660	656660	be held to account. And let me tell you,
656660	658660	people like Jeffree Star have been causing drama
658660	660660	for ages. It's just a long time
660660	662660	it had its own realms of existence,
662660	664660	and I highly doubt that before all of the
664660	666660	drama channels documenting it popped up,
666660	668660	that there was just this complete
668660	670660	absence of wrongdoings. In fact,
670660	672660	there are a couple channels who have been up for
672660	674660	a bit longer covering this. That would be
674660	676660	my guess anyway, given how quickly all
676660	678660	of these channels had a backlog of content
678660	680660	when they set up, seems like it was something fairly
680660	682660	endemic before. With all of this drama
682660	684660	suddenly erupting, you might think the beauty community
684660	686660	itself has just blown up in 2018,
686660	688660	and if you didn't watch their content,
688660	690660	you may not have even encountered their channels,
690660	692660	so the naivety is completely understandable.
692660	694660	But the truth of the matter is that many of the people
694660	696660	that we'll be talking about today, Jeffree Star
696660	698660	Laura Lee, have been extremely
698660	700660	successful for the last couple years at least,
700660	702660	and in the last Shane Dawson's little series,
702660	704660	which Star has definitely experienced a spike in stardom,
704660	706660	the drama videos didn't actually cause a huge
706660	708660	impact on the traffic these channels
708660	710660	received, within their own fanbases
710660	712660	at least. However, it has definitely led to
712660	714660	a level of accountability that many of these individuals
714660	716660	were not accustomed to. But if the beauty
716660	718660	community aren't exactly experiencing
718660	720660	exponential growth, why is there this influx
720660	722660	of reported drama? So there are a
722660	724660	few things that I believe are worth documenting
724660	726660	here. The beauty community, as I said,
726660	728660	has always had drama, that's important,
728660	730660	it was fairly run-the-mill TMZ-level
730660	732660	stuff, but it was almost an accessory to
732660	734660	the channels. A bit of tea here and there
734660	736660	was normal. This changed for a plethora
736660	738660	of reasons. As I said, the increase of
738660	740660	these drama channels definitely generated a
740660	742660	new level of scrutiny onto these creators.
742660	744660	But on top of this, why did the beauty channel
744660	746660	drama appear to take over from individuals
746660	748660	like Jake and Logan Paul? And I'm not
748660	750660	saying they didn't have any drama, they
750660	752660	had their boxing match, but no one seems to have the
752660	754660	ability to quote, expose them anymore.
754660	756660	Even the boxing match wasn't a particularly
756660	758660	profitable trending topic for many YouTubers.
758660	760660	Well, we have to go back to January to
760660	762660	understand that, back to an event which, as
762660	764660	mentioned earlier, was a defining moment
764660	766660	for many creators, which was Logan
766660	768660	Paul's little excursion. Now, the
768660	770660	whole situation was disastrous for him, yet
770660	772660	at the same time, in hindsight, although
772660	774660	he's not experiencing the views that he
774660	776660	was at the peak of his fame, Logan Paul
776660	778660	and his brother Jake are experiencing
778660	780660	considerable success, minus the criticism,
780660	782660	which is a pretty sound combination,
782660	784660	because although some may argue that any
784660	786660	press is good press, not having YouTube
786660	788660	at your throat is pretty great.
788660	790660	But why did people just lay off?
790660	792660	To understand this, we have to ask
792660	794660	ourselves, how are people being
794660	796660	exposed? Well, some may say, when
796660	798660	you do something bad.
798660	800660	But I disagree. Someone being
800660	802660	exposed is when they're shown as doing something
802660	804660	bad for their own standards, and because
804660	806660	Logan Paul set the bar so low
806660	808660	with his behaviour, he eventually fell out
808660	810660	of interest, because videos documenting
810660	812660	his questionable actions no longer became
812660	814660	questionable for him. The views
814660	816660	fell out, and even though the Paul brothers
816660	818660	are arguably just as egregious as
818660	820660	before, no one seems to care
820660	822660	anymore. Commentators who covered
822660	824660	these topics, realising the subject was
824660	826660	kinda dead, then moved in two different ways.
826660	828660	They either went to more nuanced
828660	830660	commentary, covering topics that were
830660	832660	more timeless, or they went into the whole
832660	834660	reaction commentary trend, which was just emerging
834660	836660	from a very obsessive Dr. Phil phase.
836660	838660	However, not all audiences were
838660	840660	interested in that. They're not the same
840660	842660	genres, after all. Some people still want
842660	844660	to see YouTubers being held to account for
844660	846660	misconduct. This meant there was almost a
846660	848660	leftover audience vying for some sort of
848660	850660	drama, and here they had huge potential
850660	852660	for it. And this is where this
852660	854660	little community of people was almost
854660	856660	roped into this culture, without their
856660	858660	consent, and it was almost custom-made.
858660	860660	Their naturally sassy personalities made
860660	862660	their reactions almost priceless. They had
862660	864660	an audience that was equally susceptible to
864660	866660	being engaged in drama, they had these personas
866660	868660	that were built on the foundations of being
868660	870660	friendly, smiley, to the audience,
870660	872660	and as an audience, your perception of
872660	874660	these people was very precious. They need
874660	876660	to trust these guys when they're going out
876660	878660	to buy their brands. Being a judge is
878660	880660	a role that is built on trust,
880660	882660	and moving away from just beauty products
882660	884660	gave greater potential for this situation.
884660	886660	In fact, I'd argue the relationship
886660	888660	that beauty gurus perpetuate
888660	890660	is even deeper than any genre discussed
890660	892660	on this channel before. They open up about
892660	894660	a lot, in very emotional ways,
894660	896660	which is great, but it also means there is a
896660	898660	level of consistency that they will be
898660	900660	held to account on, and with a
900660	902660	community, there will always be some people
902660	904660	who don't have genuine personas, and
904660	906660	exaggerate or fabricate to try and win over
906660	908660	audiences. So when the drama scene
908660	910660	burst through the door, dying to cover this,
910660	912660	it was going to be raucous, because the
912660	914660	community is a breeding ground for
914660	916660	factions and drama. You had
916660	918660	a load of volatile individuals who are
918660	920660	sassy as hell, and yet, at the same time,
920660	922660	love to share a unique relationship
922660	924660	with the audience. However, what we have
924660	926660	explained was how the market opened up
926660	928660	for these individuals, but why did everything
928660	930660	erupt as perfectly as it did?
940660	942660	So, I was doing my research, and I noticed
942660	944660	a trend. A lot of these drama
944660	946660	channels who were covering it were sourced
946660	948660	approximately a year ago, when some of them
948660	950660	were doing this thing where they would select a clip
950660	952660	and edit it in a way.
954660	962660	In fact, many of them popped up in the window
962660	964660	over a couple months, which is very intriguing
964660	966660	in itself, as although it's natural
966660	968660	for people to create channels covering
968660	970660	something when it's doing relatively
970660	972660	well, there was no clear motive in this
972660	974660	instance that would exactly warrant it.
974660	976660	But whatever, I don't think anything shady
976660	978660	is going on, so who cares? Many of these
978660	980660	channels then diverged in different
980660	982660	directions, realising that there was clearly
982660	984660	a lot more to do, but all while enabling
984660	986660	these foundations, and as a lot of the other drama
986660	988660	became stale to audiences, there was
988660	990660	almost just a slight enough bridge from
990660	992660	what we've seen, like the Paul brothers,
992660	994660	to this community. Arguably,
994660	996660	that bridge was paved by creators such as
996660	998660	Tana Mongeau and Shane Dawson, who had
998660	1000660	both roots in commentary and beauty,
1000660	1002660	although themselves being rather independent.
1002660	1004660	This probably lent some algorithmic
1004660	1006660	purpose to permit the sort of
1006660	1008660	sass that we've observed of recent. All of
1008660	1010660	these channels are also very well organised
1010660	1012660	with the sort of content they're creating, in fact
1012660	1014660	some of them seem pretty synchronised with
1014660	1016660	their narrative. For example, Teaspill and
1016660	1018660	HereForTheTea, at the time of writing this,
1018660	1020660	released trailers for their Jaclyn Hill collab,
1020660	1022660	and the trailers were identical. Now this
1022660	1024660	next part is conjecture, however I feel
1024660	1026660	it is fairly well grounded. A lot of these creators
1026660	1028660	in the past year have been branching out
1028660	1030660	their personas, they've been doing more personal
1030660	1032660	videos, I can't exactly say why,
1032660	1034660	but if I were to theorise, I'd say that due
1034660	1036660	to the influx of more scrutiny
1036660	1038660	from channels that are attempting to analyse
1038660	1040660	their appeal, they try and create a
1040660	1042660	third dimension, they try and introduce
1042660	1044660	another facet to their character that is
1044660	1046660	more than just makeup, after all, anyone
1046660	1048660	has access to makeup, anyone can
1048660	1050660	criticise it, anyone can criticise your
1050660	1052660	own brands, even. People can judge
1052660	1054660	it. What they can't necessarily contradict
1054660	1056660	is your character, and eventually this led
1056660	1058660	to everyone using deep stories to try and
1058660	1060660	elevate the perception their audience has
1060660	1062660	of them, and then when other people witnessed
1062660	1064660	this, they realised they had to compete in this
1064660	1066660	market as well, and eventually created
1066660	1068660	a new culture of deep opening up
1068660	1070660	emotional videos.
1082660	1084660	But equally this meant that their persona was
1084660	1086660	no longer a simple, sassy element of a channel
1086660	1088660	who could become involved in drama,
1088660	1090660	it became an issue of actual standards.
1090660	1092660	But the bigger they are, the harder they
1092660	1094660	fall, and when the whole situation surrounding
1094660	1096660	Jeffree Star, digging up the racist comments
1096660	1098660	from years ago because they didn't like what he was
1098660	1100660	doing now, it was a perfect example of
1100660	1102660	when someone's own perception of self
1102660	1104660	becomes over inflated, and they do
1104660	1106660	something fucking stupid, which it was,
1106660	1108660	and in a way, what many of these people
1108660	1110660	had said in the past years were not
1110660	1112660	any worse than what Jeffree Star said,
1112660	1114660	but what really got them were their own crafted
1114660	1116660	narratives. Firstly, they centred themselves
1116660	1118660	as this bastion, then they created
1118660	1120660	an implicit law which told their audience
1120660	1122660	if you've made racist tweets in the
1122660	1124660	past, then you should not be supported,
1124660	1126660	which is subjective, and
1126660	1128660	many people, justifiably, don't agree
1128660	1130660	to it, but it is subjective, and that's
1130660	1132660	important. However, another implicit
1132660	1134660	law that is pretty universally applied
1134660	1136660	that is almost assumed, is that you would
1136660	1138660	apply the standards that you apply to other
1138660	1140660	people onto yourself. So when it was
1140660	1142660	revealed that many of the individuals attempting
1142660	1144660	to bury poor old, or rich
1144660	1146660	old, or rich young Jeffree Star
1146660	1148660	over here, had also posted some
1148660	1150660	fairly questionable content, it essentially
1150660	1152660	completely backfired, and when their
1152660	1154660	authenticity was really put in question,
1154660	1156660	when they had to make everyone's favourite
1156660	1158660	sincere apology video, it all
1158660	1160660	fell down for a few of them. Many people
1160660	1162660	who've dealt with audiences and their judgement
1162660	1164660	know that they care much more for the
1164660	1166660	context of what it says about a character
1166660	1168660	than just barebones, heat of the moment
1168660	1170660	reactions.
1170660	1180660	None of these beauty gurus were really
1180660	1182660	perceptive enough to gauge that, their
1182660	1184660	engagement with these topics was elementary
1184660	1186660	and they paid the ultimate price,
1186660	1188660	and it hit them hard. We're talking
1188660	1190660	content cop level hard, their
1190660	1192660	subscribers punished them, because
1192660	1194660	there was this image, completely shattered,
1194660	1196660	which had only been made worse by the
1196660	1198660	fact that they'd attempted to embellish this
1198660	1200660	in the months prior, and that's what this all
1200660	1202660	represents, the perfect storm, this was
1202660	1204660	the perfect type of place for commentary
1204660	1206660	to settle for the summer, and for some
1206660	1208660	audiences too, because while Jake
1208660	1210660	and Logan were arguably behaving much
1210660	1212660	worse, people much more love to hear about the other
1212660	1214660	side of a person, that's where the whole
1214660	1216660	exposed term comes from,
1216660	1218660	and with the cultivation of all these drama channels
1218660	1220660	that really relished in the algorithmic
1220660	1222660	cycles to drive home this notion, it
1222660	1224660	all cultivated an environment for it to
1224660	1226660	take the place of the previous generation
1226660	1228660	of drama, drama is natural,
1228660	1230660	drama is organic, in many ways drama
1230660	1232660	is expected, because drama will yield from
1232660	1234660	conflict, and conflict happens when you interact
1234660	1236660	with other human beings, and honestly if there
1236660	1238660	wasn't any drama, you'd feel like it was a bit
1238660	1240660	insincere, at the same time
1240660	1242660	forcing drama will naturally make you
1242660	1244660	susceptible to being labelled as an
1244660	1246660	instigator, something equally unpopular
1246660	1248660	with an audience, but that's what these movements
1248660	1250660	represent, a change in position,
1250660	1252660	that's what drama does, if you don't
1252660	1254660	come out of drama at least thinking differently
1254660	1256660	of one of the people involved, then
1256660	1258660	chances are the tea was a tad cold,
1258660	1260660	for some reason, drama in the beauty
1260660	1262660	community, as seemingly obvious as it should
1262660	1264660	be, was ignored by many for the reasons
1264660	1266660	that I believe many perceived it as too
1266660	1268660	tabloid, drama was an accessory
1268660	1270660	as I said, however as the creators
1270660	1272660	in it sought to increase their social
1272660	1274660	standing and character depth, it gave those
1274660	1276660	on the outside more to chew on, and
1276660	1278660	more to judge, and through the facilitation
1278660	1280660	by other creators, the drama of the
1280660	1282660	beauty community quickly spread,
1282660	1284660	and we ended up here, with it arguably
1284660	1286660	being the most viewed drama of the
1286660	1288660	summer, and many of you, like me, probably
1288660	1290660	didn't even know about it. So
1290660	1292660	what for the future? I think it's difficult to
1292660	1294660	exactly say how long this will persist
1294660	1296660	as said drama is typically perpetuated
1296660	1298660	through the shifting perception between
1298660	1300660	viewer and creator, this is more possible
1300660	1302660	when there are more ways for a person's image
1302660	1304660	to be shifted, which is why a heavy
1304660	1306660	incident can equally kill potential for drama
1306660	1308660	as it may stimulate it, it appears
1308660	1310660	we may have had that huge drama,
1310660	1312660	though in the grand scheme of things
1312660	1314660	it's fairly inconsequential, so
1314660	1316660	there's definitely room for it to manifest,
1316660	1318660	the simple fact of the matter is that we
1318660	1320660	viewers like to think that we are holding people
1320660	1322660	to a moral standard, and we are to an extent,
1322660	1324660	but we have two sets of standards,
1324660	1326660	what is acceptable to
1326660	1328660	society, and what is acceptable
1328660	1330660	for a person or a community.
1330660	1332660	Now all of this drama is quite small in the grand
1332660	1334660	scheme of society, it doesn't change our
1334660	1336660	lives, Laura Lee hasn't gone out and
1336660	1338660	assaulted anyone, she's just been a bit of a
1338660	1340660	dick, but audiences haven't gravitated
1340660	1342660	to this group of people because
1342660	1344660	anything particularly egregious is going on,
1344660	1346660	it's just a new set of fresh
1346660	1348660	meat for us to get our kicks out of,
1348660	1350660	because they see themselves as
1350660	1352660	gurus, and we love to topple
1352660	1354660	people, when it comes to drama, it's
1354660	1356660	a fair weather morality, a set of dramatic
1356660	1358660	people with dramatic audiences
1358660	1360660	in dramatic situations, trying
1360660	1362660	to be moral dictators,
1362660	1364660	but once you become the dictator, the
1364660	1366660	only way is down, and
1366660	1368660	that's the tea my friends, that's
1368660	1370660	the fucking tea, see
1370660	1372660	I said it.
1382660	1384660	I want to thank two people
1384660	1386660	with regards to the creation of this video,
1386660	1388660	firstly, J Aubrey, J Aubrey,
1388660	1390660	whatever you wanna bloody call him,
1390660	1392660	for his absolutely barnstorming
1392660	1394660	part, he's a great creator, check him out
1394660	1396660	as I said, and secondly, T Spill herself
1396660	1398660	for checking my scripts with regards to
1398660	1400660	the topic and making sure the information
1400660	1402660	I was basing my judgements off was
1402660	1404660	accurate, I think that's one of the key
1404660	1406660	elements of a creator, I'd also like to give
1406660	1408660	a massive thanks to the editors, who once again,
1408660	1410660	fantastic work, great job,
1410660	1412660	definitely check them out, some of these guys
1412660	1414660	are really up there with the best,
1414660	1416660	and they will inevitably do
1416660	1418660	great things with their lives, so definitely go and
1418660	1420660	send them some love, because without them,
1420660	1422660	the channel would not be here. Anyhow, I don't think I have
1422660	1424660	too much else to say, I'd love to hear your thoughts
1424660	1426660	on the topic, even though I feel like
1426660	1428660	this is probably something slightly more
1428660	1430660	unfamiliar with my audiences, so if
1430660	1432660	this is your first encounter with it, then
1432660	1434660	honestly, I'd really like to hear your thoughts too actually,
1434660	1436660	because, you know, first impressions
1436660	1438660	mean a lot. If this is your first
1438660	1440660	impression with me, I hope it was a good one too,
1440660	1442660	if not, well, I'll try and work on that in the future.
1442660	1444660	Also, if you wanna reach me on Twitter,
1444660	1446660	at TheRightOpinion, as I said earlier,
1446660	1448660	Facebook, I use that too, though I haven't used it
1448660	1450660	as much recently, Discord, another thing
1450660	1452660	that I love to involve myself in.
1452660	1454660	All those mediums you can reach me on.
1454660	1456660	I'm an accessible man, even though I do
1456660	1458660	tend to be very busy, so
1458660	1460660	apologies if replies aren't immediate.
1460660	1462660	Anyhow, until the next one,
1462660	1464660	I'm TheRightOpinion, and I'll see you then.
1480660	1482660	Thanks for watching!
