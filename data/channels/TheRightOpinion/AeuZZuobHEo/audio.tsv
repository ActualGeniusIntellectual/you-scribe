0	19960	Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,
19960	23280	and 2020, not the most enjoyable year to say the least.
23280	28280	I recall back to my Q&A in March, when the Nostradamus Opinion announced that the year seemed to be calming down,
28280	33000	which in hindsight was a slightly misguided forecast, in fact, I'd positively say it was a kiss of death,
33000	36280	as the world has careened towards its frankly well-deserved Armageddon.
36280	42200	I've honestly not handled it too well personally, to see so much going on makes me want to curl up in a ball and hibernate,
42200	45080	or estivate if you consider when all this was happening.
45080	51280	At the same time, there's always reason within the chaos, and I've always lived by the philosophy that I emerge from hardships of wiser man,
51280	55040	and a part of me hopes that would be similarly applicable on a macro level as well,
55040	60160	however, we'll never reach that if we can't have a proper, mature discussion to understand how such discord has arisen,
60160	64680	and at times when emotions can run high, we often need voices of reason to lead that discourse forward,
64680	67040	so that we can all learn from such adversities.
67040	71880	In the past few years in particular, I feel that YouTube has become increasingly integral to that conversation,
71880	77640	introducing a new generation to the many complex, and sometimes, not so complex matters facing down today's youth,
77640	82800	with online creators engaging audiences through fresh mediums, acquainting them with new ideas and perspectives.
82840	88280	Although the nature of my channel can be a little biographical, I hope that people have found value in the viewpoints I have to share,
88280	91280	and you know what, I'd say the feedback has been broadly positive.
91280	95600	One way that people recognise the work you do often is what some regard as year-end lists,
95600	101000	where individuals compile a selection of their favourite creators and post it to their preferred social media site.
101000	107120	At the end of 2019, I was once again honoured by being placed amongst YouTubers who put great effort into their respective hustle,
107120	111800	however, one name whose presence I was surprised to see was a commentator by the name of Blair White.
112040	120960	Oh hi, welcome back to my channel. So you guys are currently in bed with me, which not a lot of people can say because I am very innocent.
120960	127400	Blair White is a creator who has been on the platform for a good few years, and has spent her time mostly preoccupied with sociopolitical commentary.
127400	133400	She presents her perspective from quite a unique angle, espousing conservative leaning narratives which wouldn't be too exceptional on paper,
133400	137800	but is somewhat intriguing when you juxtapose this ideology with the fact that Blair is transgender.
137800	145320	A lot of the times on this channel and on my social media, I'm presenting a sort of side to the trans topic that not many people are used to seeing.
145320	149720	I don't talk about things in the way that every single other trans influencer in the world talks about.
149720	154840	I don't talk about things in the way that every other trans activist you've ever seen talks about them. I am different.
154840	160480	These two positions aren't entirely incompatible, but when considering that the doctrine of social conservatism in particular
160480	168000	has often been quite hostile to LGBT rights, it would seem that adopting this outlook would be counterintuitive for anyone of that demographic's denomination.
168000	175120	However, with young republicans and conservatives seeming to be more amenable to pro-LGBT policy, the setting of an online platform aimed at a younger,
175120	184000	more broad-minded audience could not be more alluring to those who may find themselves set apart from their stereotypes by their beliefs, identity, or in this instance even, both.
184000	190120	Since launching her channel in 2016, Blair has amassed over a million subscribers, garnering a dedicated fanbase eager to see her
190160	194160	tackle subjects which can often be highly consequential for the parties involved.
194160	201160	In many ways, her personal experience as a transgender individual allowed her to provide a new energy to previously archaic conservative narratives
201160	205640	that were often weighed down by their inherent lack of empathy for the individuals at the heart of the discussion,
205640	210320	while also correcting misconceptions that had previously been peddled about Blair and many of her peers.
210320	217640	To those who admired her, and perhaps to Blair herself, White was a bridge between previously estranged communities who on the surface had very little in common.
217680	224120	However, unlike some political commentators who have sprung up in the last few years, Blair was never exactly renowned for her diplomatic demeanour.
224120	229440	If you're trans, you don't have the right to share an opinion like this, for which I actually quote tweeted them and said,
229440	231440	I'm trans, idiot!
231440	239240	They criticised me for being a transmedicalist, which is me believing that being trans is a medical issue because that's exactly what it is.
239240	244360	And just really mad that I don't think non-binary people are the same thing as trans. Too bad, too sad. Whatever.
244360	251480	In fact, from my perspective, she had been a divisive figure from since I could remember, and therefore, when seeing her alongside a fair few marred-mannered creators,
251480	257280	I was surprised. Now, I don't follow too many commentators outside my sphere, but I stay in the loop with all the current affairs,
257280	261960	and it was intriguing that someone who I knew for being moderately contentious among communities, to put it mildly,
261960	266160	had won over the hearts of those who would typically steer clear of that brand of content.
266160	270080	However, I decided not to investigate further because it wasn't really of much concern to me.
270080	273920	If she was making content that went down with a wider spectrum of viewers, then good for her.
273920	278840	Nonetheless, there was this lingering expectation in the back of my head, this may not be the last that I hear from her,
278840	283920	given that she was still outspoken on many issues, some of which would put her into conflict with some of her audience.
283920	289280	Yet, she may well have evolved, and in her videos, she definitely seemed to purport herself as a reasonable medium.
289280	294120	No, there are normal trans people out there who don't believe all these radical things.
294120	298200	And why don't those trans people get a voice? You know, there's so many people who talk about how, like,
298200	303320	every trans story needs to be heard, and we have to listen to trans people, and blah, blah, blah, and like, cool, that's great,
303320	308040	but why is it only on your terms? Why is there one narrative? And if we don't follow it, then no,
308040	310720	everyone should be heard but Blair White. Like, what are we doing?
310720	315600	Moderation. It's an important facet in 2020, with the post-election landscape to dwell on,
315600	321600	a president-elect who pledged to take the US back to some normality, yet a residual skepticism of real change,
321600	326560	and polarized tension that seemed hard to palliate. Many of her fans would have argued that Blair's place could not have
326560	329960	been more essential in healing the wounds that so many had sustained that year.
329960	334880	Unfortunately, although some may have longed for her wisdom in this critical time, it was instead about to be the subject
334880	340440	of an investigation, which provoked by an avoidable incident, would drag much of her past back into light,
340440	346680	and bring into question that self-acclaimed reputation of a reasonable, rational, and logical voice amongst all the havoc,
346680	352120	with former fans and foes asking if actually she had been the instigator of this havoc all along.
352120	356920	I have thousands of people write to me every single day that they are so disgusted with the way that trans people are portrayed
356920	361960	in the media, all because this is how trans activists, and the more radical people on the end of the spectrum,
361960	363760	are dictating it be portrayed.
363760	368680	Well, to answer that curious query, I suppose it's about time we take a look for ourselves, and to do so,
368680	373320	I'd like to go right back to 2015, where the Blair White YouTube story all began.
373320	379400	So if you'd care to join me on this journey, you'd be most welcome. Without further ado, let us commence.
379400	387960	— 2015 YouTube. How does one characterise it?
401480	404680	— Saying Sean King is white when he's white is incendiary.
404680	408680	Christ menstruating with tits isn't incendiary.
408760	412120	— I'm here to ask questions, and it seems like you guys aren't very open to them.
412120	417160	— For many years, YouTube had been the platform dominated by creators who didn't appear to take themselves too seriously.
417160	422280	However, this had been gradually evolving, and by the end of 2015, this transformation was mostly complete.
422280	428440	Now, there were still entertainers galore, but a more prominent role had been occupied by a political clique known to some as the Skeptics,
428440	431800	the title acquired from their responses to eccentric religious zealots.
431800	437880	Some of the creators in the community were more lighthearted in their narratives, merely mocking their subjects and providing casual repulsive,
437880	443960	while others tended to attack the specific fabric of arguments quite aggressively, even being quite provocative themselves.
443960	453960	— If we come from monkeys, then why are there still monkeys? And who is giving them markers and pieces of paper to write on?
453960	459400	— In spite of this, by the present year, many YouTubers in this field were also referred to as anti-SJWs,
459400	464040	an acronym for Social Justice Warrior, because they had shifted their focus towards other targets,
464040	469480	many of whom were treated with absurdity or incredulity, either in their arguments or their attitudes.
469480	474600	Now, not all skeptics went on to be anti-SJWs, and some in fact became very critical of that movement.
474600	480520	However, this movement also seemed to broadly merge with creators who had not necessarily made anti-creationist content prior,
480520	487240	some of whom, gamers, others just casual creators turned commentators, mobilised by incidents such as the infamous gamer gate,
487240	490280	or just general antics that they felt were worth calling out.
490280	503460	— ...overprofessional goals, plus minimising their own
503460	507320	— Of many online, it was not hard to see why. They were generally not the most personable individuals,
507320	510920	often presenting their somewhat radical ideas in a rather disagreeable fashion,
510920	518120	and this subsequently made them quite easy prey for the enlightened commentator who'd regularly descend from the heavens to put the half-wits in their place.
518120	524040	I even dabbled in it here and there myself, though that year I must say I had more pressing matters to attend to.
524040	535720	— What I do understand is that Jeremy Hunt is not qualified to run the NHS. His approval rating lies at 17%. 17 fucking percent.
535720	540920	Fantastic Four has a better public rating. Fantastic fucking four.
540920	543720	— Damn, I really put those politicians in their place.
543720	549880	— Anyhow, turning back to this genre of creators, in reflection, it's very easy to look back at that social zeitgeist in a sneering fashion,
549880	554520	but there were many who were very invested from a variety of political factions, because at the time,
554520	560200	I feel that what a lot of these self-proclaimed advocates of social justice represented to these creators and audiences alike
560200	565720	was an attack on an internet culture quite sacred at the time, and one heavily exhibited in a variety of content,
565720	568280	the sort of edge without any real weight behind it.
568280	573480	— I will see how it goes after a week. Can we do next promotion? Hell yeah, yellow n***a.
573480	577880	At the same time, it's important not to undersell the level of political engagement in a lot of these videos.
577880	581880	There was a lot more at stake than just what happened online, and a lot more depth to the discourse,
581880	587000	particularly contained within a multitude of social issues which had seeped onto the platform as tensions in the real world
587000	593000	appeared to be rising with the impending plebiscites. It was an exciting time to be a creator in that genre,
593000	598040	and more people wanted to be involved, one of those being our fabled title character.
598040	603320	At this moment, Blair was a computer science student at the California State University Chico campus,
603320	607400	however, she was not having the most fun with her life, feeling a bit outcast by her identity,
607400	613640	a transgender, yet conservative leaning individual, a stark contrast to many of her liberal professors and fellow students.
613640	617640	Like many others in such a position, Miss White found more at home in the online sphere,
617640	622040	a place that she likely felt was more accommodating towards her beliefs and attitudes.
622040	626760	In many ways, the online world has provided a protective enclave for a variety of identities,
626760	631880	especially those that may face ostracism in real life. This was merely another branch of that outlet,
631880	635960	who knows exactly when she decided to become a YouTuber, but a turning point appeared to be when
635960	640280	she appeared on stream with Crayta, who we can assume to be Theron Meyer, based on the tweet,
640280	644760	and obviously based on the archive of the video. It seems that many people encouraged her to start
644760	648840	uploading her own content, and not too long after, her first video was published.
648840	653800	BLAIR Hello, my name is Blair, for those of you who don't know, and in this video, I'm going to be discussing
653800	657720	a few related topics, one being feminism, the next being the men's rights movement,
658680	665800	also the concepts of privilege, both male and female privilege, and just kind of my thoughts on all those things.
665800	670120	TRO Now, Theron, whose stream Blair had made the aforementioned appearance on, was a creator mostly
670120	674040	focused around advocating for men's rights at the time, and therefore, it made sense that Blair's
674040	678840	maiden video covers similar talking points. The upload in question is titled Female Privilege,
678840	683400	and as the title implies, it seeks to observe various deficits in society, where women actually
683400	688440	possess an advantage over their male counterparts, seemingly in contrast to many narratives disseminated
688440	690200	by accredited institutes.
690200	694680	BLAIR I've lived my life on both sides of the coin, per se, at different periods of my life.
695480	701080	I think I definitely am in a position to critique the concept of privilege, as it's perpetuated by
701080	705800	feminist ideology. So there was a shift that happened in the way that the world interacted with me,
705800	710920	as I went further into my transition, sort of the way that strangers interacted with me, the way I was
710920	717640	treated, it all changed. It manifested in ways such as doors being held open for me, seats on
717640	723240	public transportation being surrendered instantly, really. The term ladies first is definitely
723240	726360	something that's actually implemented, it's not just a phrase.
726360	731080	TRO However, Blair also uses the video to express her own personal investments, and experiences given
731080	735080	her a rather unique background in this dialogue. As a person who has transitioned, Blair sees
735080	739480	herself as someone who has encountered both sides of the gender coin, and thus also the privileges
739480	744040	and drawbacks of constructs often bestowed onto such identities, implying this provides her with
744040	749080	unique insight onto the topic, juxtaposing these differing experiences. She calls upon personal
749080	752680	observations, before sharing some hard-hitting statistics with her viewers.
752680	758680	BLAIR The truth is that men make up 80% of suicides, nearly half of all domestic violence victims,
758680	762520	more men in the US are raped, that is when you factor in prison statistics,
763240	769560	77% of homicide victims, 93% of workplace deaths, 88% of homeless individuals are male,
770200	775080	and they're constantly screwed over in child custody and alimony cases.
775080	779400	TRO This sort of content was hardly exceptional, mostly parroting core talking points made by a lot
779400	783800	of its proponents, however, as a cornerstone for what her content was to become, it seemed to lay
783800	788680	the framework quite nicely. Her tone, although stern, was not hostile, her sources, occasional
788680	792600	spelling error aside, are cited, and her production, although somewhat lacking, still
792600	797000	allowed for content to be digestible. To be frank, a lot of political content back then consisted of
797000	801160	an avatar that, if you were lucky, moved its arms up and down, so to have a fully expressive
801160	804440	individual talking about these topics may have been considered a blessing to many.
804440	808600	BLAIR These numbers definitely seem unfamiliar to most people, I know they definitely were to me
808600	813960	when I started researching all of these things, but the reason they seem so unfamiliar, and maybe
814040	818760	even not so believable, is because feminism does not even allow the conversation to be had.
818760	823080	TRO As an upload, Blair White's anti-feminist stance didn't tell us much about the world,
823080	826040	but it did tell us a bit about Blair, however, there was more to come,
826040	832360	and first impressions can only tell us so much. BLAIR So those are my thoughts on the topics at
832360	839160	hand, and I definitely want anyone who disagrees with me to comment, because I am open to people
839160	844680	disagreeing with me, I like having my views challenged, and I am willing to change my mind
844680	851800	if I'm proven wrong, so bye. TRO Blair's first upload was met with thoughts from many within
851800	855240	the community that she was appealing to, particularly given her mostly forthcoming
855240	859960	tone and open-minded outlook. Nonetheless, it was more than that, due to the previously expressed
859960	864200	contrast of Blair's gender identity with her political identity, and how she used it in
864200	879160	discourse. In a way, it dynamically flipped a narrative that had been traditionally associated
879160	883720	with fairly progressive circles, the reference to how one's experience and identity can often shape
883720	888120	their viewpoints, often being used as a stimulus to call for more diversity in certain intellectual
888120	892280	circles. Here we had someone who represented that diverse upbringing, but whose ideological
892280	896360	path diverged from that which would be expected of someone who was stereotypically associated
896360	901240	with her demographic. Many clearly welcomed this, though you may be justified in finding
901240	906280	some people's enthusiasm a little nauseating. At the same time, as she acknowledges herself,
906280	911240	she still passes as a cis woman in many spaces, so her perspective is somewhat different to that
911240	915240	of other trans people who may be subjected to stigma relating to their appearance.
916200	921240	But I am lucky enough that I can enter most public spaces, and the world does interact with me as a
921240	924920	woman, not as a trans person or as a man.
924920	928680	Now, there were many criticisms that could be levelled towards her narratives, particularly
928680	933720	given her tendency to conflate her specific experience as a woman with female experiences
933720	937560	in general, an issue that would rear its head in future escapades. However, she didn't seem
937560	941640	averse to criticism, and still pointed towards clear systemic inequalities that should be
941720	946680	addressed. As first videos go, it could be worse, and her next few videos followed a similar pattern.
947320	953880	He tells a story, and I don't remember exactly what his situation was, but basically, his situation
953880	958120	was worse than any girls in this class who talked about how their boyfriend used to verbally abuse
958120	965000	them, or used to hit them, or used to grab them, whatever. Everyone in the class started laughing.
965000	973880	Literally. I think the only person that didn't laugh was the f***ing me, and the instructor,
973880	979800	the professor. And the truth is, you know, more women in the US are affected by domestic violence
979800	989080	in terms of being victims, but it's something like over 40% are men, so it's not like it's 90-10
989080	995320	or 80-20, it's like 60-40, and I would venture to guess that it might even be closer to 50-50
995320	1000680	if you take into account the fact that men don't talk about it, and when they do, they get f***ing
1000680	1006280	laughed at. And it does intersperse with some factual information, often as a secondary feature.
1006280	1010680	This isn't to a detriment, and there are many perceptual benefits to this, such as a more intimate
1010680	1014760	relationship between the creator and their audience, but it also means there is a sense of trust
1014760	1018600	that needs to be invested in the creator. For some people, that degree of trust needs to be earned,
1018600	1022920	but if you're speaking to a believable experience that resonates with people, then the threshold is
1022920	1027400	often lowered, so certain stories of institutional intolerance may hit closer to home for some
1027400	1032200	individuals, particularly if it fits into their worldview. And back then, the idea of vicious,
1032200	1036360	college-dwelling feminists who added in for every cursed bloke who had ever set foot on Earth wasn't
1036360	1040120	one that seemed far-fetched at all, especially with the prevailing narratives in many of these
1040120	1043880	communities, substantiated by many, frankly, unflattering clips.
1043960	1049880	What? Humongous what? Humongous what? Humongous what? Humongous what?
1051000	1055480	This person just spoke to me in a sexually harassing way.
1055480	1056600	Yeah, he did.
1056600	1061240	Blair's early output was definitely built on a somewhat personal connection between herself and the audience.
1061240	1065640	This could also be reflected in the fact that her fourth video was a Q&A, surprisingly premature for
1065640	1069720	a channel's lifespan, but she portrayed herself as an open book who felt comfortable divulging
1069720	1073320	details about her life, which consequently commanded a lot of respect from her viewers.
1073320	1077160	However, at the same time, this personal journey granted her with a lot of flexibility in the
1077160	1081160	topics she could tackle, and with each subject she approached, we seemed to learn more about her,
1081160	1085640	and her curious opinions. Her videos were even structured in a way so that they would follow on
1085640	1090440	previous theses, though this may alienate people who don't necessarily agree with her presuppositions,
1090440	1095080	especially ones that kind of assumed that she was correct, which wouldn't necessarily be the case.
1095720	1100440	So now that we're all in agreeance that feminism is indeed cancer, let us take a look at the ways
1100440	1107080	in which feminism is, like a virus, able to spread its misinformation, half-truths, blatant lies,
1107080	1109320	and overall retardedness through the internet.
1109320	1113960	Oh, okay, I guess we established that then. The thing is that it's hard to go along with these
1113960	1117720	assumptions when a lot of Blair's points aren't the most ironclad, and to be brutally honest,
1117720	1122120	Blair's content didn't particularly stand out in the points that she made from a lot of other creators,
1122120	1124200	sometimes falling quite short.
1124200	1130120	And it's true that women do have a higher pressure to look youthful and to stay young because we do
1130120	1136520	value that in women within this culture, but that expectation is directly perpetuated by women.
1138120	1143800	The billion-dollar beauty industry, which is advertising anti-aging creams and
1145400	1152760	Botox and things like that, those are largely ran by women, made for women. So if this meme is
1152760	1157480	trying to imply that men are doing this to women, it's actually not true.
1157480	1161640	This is from a video titled Feminism is Pointless, though it was very charmingly titled
1161640	1166120	Feminism is Cancer at one point, where Blair reacts to a slew of memes that vary in their
1166120	1170520	logical soundness, but also expose some of Blair's internal biases, such as the one shown in that
1170520	1175000	curious clip. Now, even if Blair was correct in her assertion regarding industry leaders,
1175000	1178840	it wouldn't necessarily be a valid response because the meme was a critique of society,
1178840	1183400	rather than men specifically, and it never asserted that men presently were the sole cause of harsher
1183400	1188040	beauty standards that were often imposed onto women, an issue that Blair acknowledges as
1188040	1192920	existent right off the bat. Now, as noted, this is freshman content from our budding creators,
1192920	1197960	so we can't expect everything to fall into place perfectly. I'm sure I and many other creators were
1197960	1202840	hardly producing content of the highest order at this size, but it was symptomatic of that desire
1202840	1206520	to prove a point, even when there wasn't one to be proven exactly.
1206520	1211960	So this one's cute. It's a picture of a feminist father wearing a shirt explaining that when it
1211960	1217080	comes to dating his daughter, he doesn't make the rules, and her daughter's boyfriend does not make
1217080	1222200	the rules. So if you want to stick a blowtorch up his daughter's asshole and tell her to pretend to
1222200	1229000	be a Charmander, he's fine with that because it's her body. Uh, thank you for your contribution,
1229000	1233800	Blair. Yes, in spite of the personal tone and story shared, it feels like there is still a
1233800	1238360	default back to a generic narrative employed by a lot of creators around that time.
1238440	1243480	It's really frustrating to me that we live in a climate where there's all this discussion of gender
1243480	1248360	politics, and these conversations often include things like manspreading, and mansplaining,
1248360	1254360	and catcalling, and we have this huge elephant in the room, 80% of suicide victims being male,
1254360	1259480	and we're not talking about it. The hack need any way feminism bad, or strained what aboutisms.
1259480	1263400	Sure, the number of men who take their own lives is undoubtedly alarming, but I don't know why that
1263400	1267400	has to be compared to a discussion about catcalling, a behaviour which, I have to admit,
1267400	1272280	I personally find rather grotesque. This is an example of what was indeed a greater problem in
1272280	1276920	the community at the time, but also one found on the channel, being that it felt like Blair was
1276920	1280920	drawn towards conclusions that would serve a specific agenda. This may have been a case of
1280920	1284920	tunnel vision. When reviewing certain arguments, it becomes rather apparent.
1284920	1289640	You have to question the motive of a person who's willing to be abused, willing to stay in a bad
1289640	1294520	situation more than someone who's just a asshole who's gonna hurt someone regardless of who it is.
1295320	1300280	There had to be something more to Blair, something that would elevate herself above the rote anti-SJW
1300280	1305080	commentator. Well, there was. Her unique perspective and identity, right? Well,
1305080	1309320	going off the first few videos, it was hard to exactly see how this influenced her worldview,
1309320	1312040	but this was all about a change very soon.
1325480	1332120	You know, what are the ramifications of being called a hoe by 40 people?
1332120	1336680	It'll affect your social life, probably. It's embarrassing, probably.
1336680	1339960	But what are the ramifications of being accused of being a rapist?
1339960	1344440	You see, Blair's video responding to the feminist means was an interesting one in particular,
1344440	1348200	because it definitely showcased a capacity for her to be a bit more assertive. As stated,
1348200	1352440	there was a mixture of tones in which creators addressed the subjects of their videos. In earlier
1352440	1356040	uploads, whether you agreed with Blair's conclusions or not, she didn't seem outwardly
1356040	1360920	hostile, but this in particular seemed to be a pivot towards the combative content often tied to
1360920	1365320	some of the edgier creators in the genre. At the same time, though, they were memes, and you could
1365320	1370040	argue that she was at least mirroring the same energy that many of them emanated. It wasn't a
1370040	1375240	typical Blair White video, no, I think the video of interest comes a couple uploads later.
1375240	1381000	Hey guys, so one of the things people ask me about pretty often is my opinion on the sort of long list
1381000	1385080	of arbitrary, obscure gender identities that exist out in the world.
1385080	1390520	Which video could this be? Maybe it's the one titled Trans mentally challenged. I will expand
1390520	1394680	on why this is, though once again, mostly serving as casual grounds for our channel's hostess to
1394680	1399320	spew opinions on a hot topic is also a very relevant video, as for the first time, Blair's
1399320	1402920	opinion on many trans issues is coming to the forefront of her brand.
1402920	1406840	So yeah, I think all these identities are largely bullshit, I think they're super arbitrary,
1406840	1411800	I think they're super meaningless, I think people who take them on are usually extremely
1411800	1417880	boring and have nothing else for their personality other than I'm demi-queer, non-binary, gender
1418680	1424680	special snowflake kin, and if you pay attention to these people, you'll notice that very rarely
1424680	1430440	will you meet someone who identifies as one of these things who is not heavily involved in
1430440	1435400	political activism to some extent. In the video, she dismisses individuals who lie outside the
1435400	1439240	traditional gender binary, makes some pretty generalised, presumptive comments about their
1439240	1444120	status and motives for assuming such identities, and in general comes off as quite elitist.
1444120	1449240	These people are usually middle class, white, never had to struggle with anything in their life,
1449240	1455080	but they want to call themselves a suppressed sexual gender minority as a means to silence
1455080	1459400	any type of opposition they have in any type of political conversation, because in our current
1459400	1462760	political climate, oppression is a very valuable currency.
1462760	1465800	Now, I'm sure there are many responses one can formulate to her statements here,
1465800	1469400	and comments that you and I are itching to make, but now I would like to put a pin on it,
1469400	1473400	as I think we best keep an open mind and merely say that it serves as a good precedent for the
1473400	1477560	content that was to follow, that rather noticeable distaste that Blair seemed to possess for those
1477560	1482520	who fell outside the acceptability range of traditional gender norms. Yes, and as I noted
1482520	1486600	before, when approaching topics on previous Discourse, even topics pertaining to gender,
1486600	1490760	like the upload before, she seemed reasonable, but this was a turn, and this persisted in
1490760	1494920	uploads following as well, not just in her tone, but in her attitude towards others,
1494920	1496520	and I will elaborate here.
1499400	1504120	I avoided explicitly mentioning the title of this upload, as it's not a term I tend to indulge,
1504120	1507960	however, back then it was more than commonplace. In spite of this acknowledgement,
1507960	1512040	Blair still weaponised it in a rather derogatory manner, and her subsequent uploads,
1512040	1517400	although having more temperate titles, can often be found to have much more provocative captions
1517480	1522600	at the time, thanks to Blair's extremely professional thumbnails, and thanks to the archives.
1522600	1528520	For example, feminist thinks all men are rapists, or triggering trans... gender people.
1528520	1532120	Damn it Blair, you really love a good slur in the worst of contexts.
1532120	1535880	I'd like to say she rectified these outer remorse, but given the fact that she's left
1535880	1540760	offensive terms in other titles, I assume it was to try and stop YouTube from demonetising or age
1540760	1545320	restricting them, because in other places she's changed them when there really was no offensive
1545320	1549720	term, just a sensitive word, such as this one where I assume racist obviously set off the YouTube
1549720	1555080	alarm, so Blair, in a state of pure indolence, changed the title to just minorities,
1555080	1557640	but as amusing as that is, I will move on for now.
1560680	1564600	As said, this era was a curious one for sure, particularly for the political community online.
1564600	1568600	It was one where many felt free from the shackles that had bound them in real life environments,
1568600	1572760	and some clearly felt a catharsis in expressing themselves in a more unabashed manner.
1572760	1576280	Nonetheless, I think some of these creators listened to a bit too much Ice Cube and drew
1576280	1580760	the conclusion that a black person, exclaiming the N-word on a rap track, gave them license to start
1580760	1585640	directing their decently sized platforms towards other creators, and barraging them with a slew of
1585640	1591160	pretty relentless content, fortified by slurs that they felt more comfortable firing off due to their
1591160	1595400	identity. This wasn't exclusive to Blair, Theron, for example, was another person who engaged in
1595400	1600040	similar antics. However, the fact that many of these comments or insults were often used
1600040	1604680	in an exclusionary or alienating fashion against people who may have personal history with those
1604680	1606760	words didn't really justify it.
1606760	1612360	So Kat Blaque's a YouTuber who's about as balls deep in Tumblr's social justice as one could possibly get,
1612360	1614360	and balls deep is appropriate because she's a traitor.
1614360	1619800	100% comedy from Blair White over here, you can tell that she would have surely become a stand-up
1619800	1624120	if she had not pursued political commentary, but in a way where some may dismiss this as pointless
1624120	1628440	edginess, critics would often see it as part of a greater ruse, which would be observed in other
1628520	1633240	videos, with one garnering particular personal heat from myself. Yes, after making multiple response
1633240	1638120	videos to content that our queen had decreed as cringe, it seems that Miss White had her finger on
1638120	1640520	the pulse of so many of those around her.
1640520	1646120	So today I want to talk about why people don't like trans people. I've received thousands upon thousands of
1646120	1651080	emails, comments, messages from people saying that before finding my channel, they had absolutely
1651080	1655560	no understanding of trans people, and that they were shocked to find a trans person who was actually
1655640	1656120	sane.
1656120	1661000	In this lovely upload, once again amended to have a more restrained headline, she decides to discuss
1661000	1665400	exactly what the public's problems are with the transgender community, firstly mentioning about her
1665400	1670360	experiences with many people who previously weren't aware of the existence of sane transgender people,
1670360	1673480	until they encountered the wonders of Blair White.
1673480	1677800	Because let's just face it, the majority of the ideas and policies and things that come out of the
1677800	1683080	trans community and the activists that they prop up to speak for them in the public sphere are insane.
1683160	1688360	I mean, I personally sometimes feel like I'm just drowning in this huge crowd of people who are screaming
1688360	1694200	and crying about 97 genders, and I'm just in the back like... I'm not one of them.
1694200	1698440	The transgender community then becomes this buzzword, and Blair once more sets herself apart,
1698440	1703480	affirming her opposition to Bill C-16, for example, the controversial Canadian one that saw the rise of
1703480	1708360	Jordan Peterson, and in this she also calls out the transgender community on other incidents, such as
1708360	1713000	one where trans activists were allegedly pressuring the midwife community into using gender neutral
1713000	1717720	terminology, referencing an Infowars article, which could have used a little research in itself,
1717720	1722120	because most evidence appears to imply that there was little to no evidence of any pressure being
1722120	1727080	applied at all, but okay, that's one reference, we'll put that aside for now, her point is clear
1727080	1728040	enough regardless.
1728040	1733320	But I'm sorry, like I said, acceptance is a two-way street, and behaving like insufferable children who
1733320	1737800	place emotion-based arguments over fact-based arguments is not a way to get anything done.
1738600	1745320	There was a moment in time where Blair White just wanted to grill, but that was no longer an option,
1745320	1749800	and in taking a stand against these trans activists who were making all these unreasonable demands of
1749800	1754600	society, she was proving that transgender people weren't this monolith that many had previously
1754600	1759480	assumed them to be, but was anyone ever saying this, and was Blair's narrative really as
1759480	1761080	altruistic as it appeared to be?
1768360	1785240	Instead of arguing for the validity of transgenderism on a neurological or physiological level, you guys
1785240	1791320	instead give up and start screaming and crying about how there's 97 genders, it's like, calm down,
1791320	1792120	calm it down.
1792120	1796440	The examples covered in my previous part may have found Blair approaching the aspects of trans issues
1796440	1800360	from different angles, but they all seem to transport me back to the school playground in a way,
1800360	1801720	and I'll explain why in a moment.
1801720	1805720	The channel was always a very personal venture, and this upload was no exception, because although she
1805720	1810680	proclaims that she is attempting to decipher the issue from within the community, she mostly uses it
1810680	1815240	as a springboard to pat herself on the back, and tell people who aren't like her to calm down.
1815240	1821160	And need I remind you that America, and western civilization in general, is the pinnacle of safety and
1821160	1826120	freedom for trans people, and by the way, that statement is actually true for every group of people
1826120	1826920	under the sun.
1826920	1831560	As a trans person, you can't step foot in a single middle eastern country without fear of being
1831560	1835240	jailed or worse, and the same goes for pretty much every African country.
1835240	1840040	In America, you have access to transgender medical care, the ability to legally amend your gender,
1840040	1841960	I can't see a relative probation, Blair.
1841960	1843400	Basic bitch logic.
1843400	1843960	Come on.
1843960	1850520	Is that I think there's a lot more people out there who are opposed to the bat crazy ideas and policies
1850520	1855320	that come out of the trans community and their activists, rather than trans people themselves.
1855320	1859720	Because let's just face it, the majority of the ideas and policies and things that come out of the
1859720	1864920	trans community and the activists that they prop up to speak for them in the public sphere are insane.
1864920	1869400	I think it was tangible that at the time, people had received an impression of leftism, or at least
1869400	1873000	certain branches of leftism due to chronicled attitudes of certain activists.
1873000	1877320	However, to extend that logic to entire demographics and identity groups was ludicrous.
1877320	1881800	All in all, it felt part of a greater narrative, which aside from being rather egotistical, like
1881800	1885880	come on, you started your channel after appearing on stream with a transgender woman who espoused
1885880	1889720	similar talking points at the time, it felt like an attempt to cater to people to win over their
1889720	1892840	approval by being the quote, cool transgender person.
1892840	1898040	This may be impudent for me to say, but it felt like the goal of 2016 Blair was her own acceptance,
1898040	1900040	rather than acceptance of the greater community.
1900040	1904120	On Twitter and YouTube, she would present herself as the emissary, but I don't think the opposite
1904120	1906040	could have been more true in a way.
1906040	1910200	It felt like a playground where she was trying to fit in with a certain clique by ostracising
1910200	1913560	others, by proving that she was worthy, almost like initiation.
1913560	1918280	In response to this, you could say that okay, the mainstream was a lot of the time the intolerant
1918280	1923720	progressive lot, and maybe at her university it was, I'm happy to entertain that, but on YouTube
1923720	1928360	it was a very different story, and once you take advantage of the power that you have to belittle
1928360	1933000	others in your own domain, then you're no better than those you chastise so fervently.
1933000	1937160	This can be embodied more than it is in the title, and once again, Blair had initially,
1937160	1942040	and quite ironically, used a slur in presenting why some people just don't really like transgender
1942040	1946520	individuals. Now, some transgender individuals may be okay or comfortable with that, but many aren't,
1946520	1951880	and already addressing a group of people in such a way is going to breed division and provocation.
1951880	1955880	Really, you could make the argument that Blair was validating using slurs in such a manner,
1955880	1960520	that's only really going to win one side over and provoke the other, and when they are inevitably
1960520	1964600	provoked, Blair will just tell them to calm down again and high five all her edgy friends.
1965240	1969880	Having someone who set the bar so low for trans acceptance could make it easy for people to accept
1969880	1974440	her, and reject other trans people who in many ways weren't making unbelievably preposterous
1974440	1977800	demands from those around them, and you could make the argument that those people were never
1977800	1982280	going to accept other transgender individuals regardless, and that Blair was at least making
1982280	1987480	some level of acceptance somewhat accessible, maybe she provided a ramp into the transgender
1987480	1991960	community. I think this would be a somewhat valid response on the surface, and that in many ways,
1992040	1996440	Blair's position as a moderate could have been used to facilitate discourse between two separate
1996440	2000840	camps, but this never fully materialised because she only aligned herself with the ideas of one of
2000840	2005480	them, and Blair never really made an effort to facilitate acceptance of people, sometimes quite
2005480	2009880	the opposite, in fact, because her own bar of acceptance was high and sometimes rather uneven,
2009880	2014200	and would lead one to wonder what sort of environment her own principles would lead to.
2014200	2016440	Case in point, the following situation.
2016440	2018280	Would you date someone who's trans?
2019080	2019720	No.
2019720	2021000	Would you date someone who's black?
2021560	2022280	Maybe.
2022280	2023800	Would you date someone who's fat?
2024680	2025180	No.
2025800	2027960	Would you date someone who's disabled?
2027960	2028440	No.
2028440	2032120	One of the common recipients of Blair White's responses was a creator by the name of Riley
2032120	2036200	Dennis. She was known for her takes at the time, which many found contentious, particularly given
2036200	2040520	the era where she posted a preponderance of her political opinions in. I have to admit that I
2040520	2044520	disagreed with a lot of what she had to say at the time, and I still probably wouldn't align with
2044520	2048840	a fair proportion of what she said then today. However, disagreement is a healthy constituent
2048840	2052920	of academic discourse, and the online sphere should be fertile ground to nurture productive
2052920	2057400	discussion. However, Blair's demeanour towards Riley isn't what one would always characterise
2057400	2063000	as, well, healthy. The first video released on Blair's thoughts on trans special people
2063000	2067240	is a response to a now-deleted Riley Dennis video, which asserts that feminism isn't about
2067240	2072200	hating men, amongst many other things. At this point, Riley was identifying as a non-binary
2072200	2076600	trans woman. However, throughout the video, Blair refers to Riley as a he for reasons that
2076600	2080840	are not explicitly clarified, but one can assume are in line with those expressed in the upload
2080840	2086120	prior. I can't believe it's 2016 and we still have to talk about this. Okay, right off the bat,
2086120	2093160	he's using the current year as an argument. In another video where she contends Riley's
2093160	2097400	assertion that misgendering is violence, Blair generally avoids referring to Riley under any
2097400	2102040	pronouns whatsoever, an option she probably thought was decidedly smarter given the topic.
2102040	2105960	After concluding that misgendering is not violence but still a dick move, she takes the time to
2105960	2110280	express her feelings on the matter of Riley's gender. And Riley, you seem to be really upset
2110280	2114920	that people don't refer to you as she everywhere you go, but can you really blame them? Like,
2114920	2119320	honestly, you call yourself a woman and a trans woman, but you actively talk about how you won't
2119320	2124120	take hormones, and hormone therapy and surgery in some cases are what's actually going to give you
2124120	2128680	those secondary sex characteristics that allow people to visually perceive you as a woman,
2129560	2135000	Now, her statements on what Riley said are completely false, but we'll cross that bridge soon,
2135000	2139880	we have other antics to address first. In tweets around this time, Blair was still taking more than
2139880	2145000	enough liberties on labelling Riley under male pronouns, once more reaffirming her sentiments
2145000	2149720	on the transition, and proudly undermining any neutrality conveyed in that YouTube video,
2149720	2153800	and a couple months later, Blair returned back to using male pronouns in her upload.
2154280	2159480	In spite of this, Blair had also still used a heralded transgender slur in titles referring
2159480	2164120	to Riley's uploads, which I find surprising if you didn't actually believe Riley to be transgender,
2164120	2168520	really having your cake and eating it there. I have to say that I found what was flip-flopping
2168520	2172600	at best, and straight up self-contradiction at worst, and some other things as well,
2172600	2177560	rather confusing. Is this what bridging the gap looks like? Well, maybe that's not what it
2177560	2182440	appears, maybe over time Blair worked up this theory in her head regarding Riley, and in an
2182440	2187240	upload posted to YouTube on June the 18th 2017, her theories come to the forefront of the
2187240	2191320	commentary, with multiple backhanded comments about Blair's thoughts on the severity of Riley's
2191320	2193560	gender identity. What were these thoughts?
2193560	2198200	Riley, I know you're having trouble with this whole transition thing, mainly that you haven't
2198200	2203400	done it. You know, if you went on estrogen, your sex drive wouldn't be so high, and you wouldn't
2203400	2208040	be guilt tripping people into having sex with you. Just saying. But if anyone calls you a white
2208040	2212280	supremacist, you deny it. If anyone accuses you of guilt tripping lesbians into sucking your dick,
2212280	2213800	by saying you're trans, deny it.
2213800	2218760	Blair's suspicions were very clear. Riley's existence as a trans person was merely political
2218760	2222600	and self-serving, and that in time this would be revealed, as she wouldn't follow through on her
2222600	2228120	transitioning properly. Why won't Riley take the estrogen, and what would it tell us about her?
2228680	2230440	Ooh, well...
2230440	2235800	Hey everybody, so today, the day this video is going live, I'm going to be on my way to
2235800	2240440	San Francisco in preparation for my facial feminization surgery, or FFS for short.
2240440	2244200	Somebody was about to have their well-deliberated theory swiftly debunked,
2244200	2248120	leaving us to wonder if these playground hijinks were really worthwhile.
2248120	2269800	...
2269800	2276040	Several large YouTubers have been peddling the myth that I'm not really trans for well over a year
2276040	2281000	now. They say I'm not a true trans because they claim I'm not taking any steps to transition,
2281000	2283080	like not taking hormones and not having surgery.
2283080	2288680	On June the 26th, 2017, Riley Dennis would upload a video, basically expressing what I would say
2288680	2292520	to the theories advocated by Blair and others in the community around this time,
2292520	2296760	that it's none of their f***ing business, and that her status as a trans person shouldn't depend on
2296760	2298520	what procedures she's embarking on.
2299160	2304120	These people who vehemently hate me, and make videos misgendering me, and insulting me,
2304120	2308840	and making assumptions about my personal life, they feel entitled to information about my
2308840	2312040	personal life, but I don't owe them that. I don't owe anyone that.
2312040	2315800	What happens in my personal life is nobody's business but my own.
2315800	2320280	What medications I take, what surgeries I have, what steps I take to transition,
2320280	2323880	all of that is my business, and nobody else is entitled to that.
2323880	2326600	Especially not strangers on the internet.
2326600	2330920	I have every right to keep all of that information to myself.
2330920	2334360	Being trans is not defined by hormones or surgery.
2334360	2337320	Surgeries and hormones do not change your gender identity.
2337320	2340680	External things like that do not affect your internal sense of gender.
2340680	2342280	Which is what being trans is.
2342280	2346520	So I don't want this to come across as me trying to prove that I'm a good trans now.
2346520	2350200	I will be just as trans after FFS as I was before FFS.
2350200	2353720	And I refuse to throw other trans people under the bus just because they don't take
2353720	2355960	hormones or haven't had surgery or don't pass.
2355960	2360360	Because I think that's a really gross way of gatekeeping who's allowed in the trans community.
2360440	2364120	However, it doesn't stop there because Riley also reveals that she will be actively
2364120	2367240	undergoing facial feminization surgery in the next few weeks,
2367240	2371000	and had already been receiving hormone replacement therapy for almost a year,
2371000	2373640	leaving those like Blair who had been chastised and Riley
2373640	2377640	pretty ferociously in the public sphere, and all these theories out to dry.
2377640	2380440	I'll add that our progressive friend here didn't come unprepared,
2380440	2384520	dropping an ample sum of receipts to reinforce just how unsubstantiated
2384520	2387000	many of these claims made about her identity were.
2387000	2390680	All these claims by other YouTubers that I haven't been on hormones were just
2390680	2394200	completely fabricated lies not based on anything I've ever said.
2394200	2397160	In fact, a couple months ago, I got really worried about this.
2397160	2400120	I knew that I hadn't talked about hormones since I had started them,
2400120	2403080	but I thought maybe I had said something before that?
2403080	2407320	So I searched through my Twitter timeline for any mentions of hormones or HRT,
2407320	2411240	and I only found two tweets where I talked about hormones in relation to myself.
2411240	2415880	One was from over a year ago, and I said I was planning on starting hormones as soon
2415880	2419560	as I moved back to the US. The second one was also from over a year ago,
2419560	2422680	and it was me saying that I was planning to start HRT soon.
2422680	2427320	That's it. Those are the only times I've ever tweeted about hormones or HRT in relation to
2427320	2431480	myself, and I was literally saying that I was planning to take hormones.
2431480	2435320	Anybody who took half a second to search through my Twitter could have found this information.
2435320	2441240	So I think I'm going to be starting hormones. I don't know about surgeries or anything like that
2441240	2445400	yet. It's all kind of up in the air for me. But I have proof from YouTube and Twitter that
2445400	2449960	I'm right, and they're wrong. They've been maliciously and intentionally spreading lies about me.
2449960	2453320	Obviously, at approximately half an hour in total, there's a little more discussed than what I've
2453320	2457720	spoken about now, but as a scaling clap back to many of the conspiracists, the video served its
2457720	2462200	purpose, placing the ball quite squarely back into Blair's court. Now, as Riley had indicated,
2462200	2466520	Blair wasn't the sole proponent of this narrative. However, as a reasonably sized creator and a
2466520	2470920	transgender woman herself, it was pretty imperative that this little blunder be addressed.
2470920	2476600	So on June the 29th, three days after Riley's shocking revelations, Blair uploads,
2476600	2478040	I'm sorry.
2478040	2484680	Okay, so this is a video that I really did not expect to ever make, ever, but those are always the most
2484680	2485720	interesting ones, right?
2485720	2490120	In this video, Blair takes responsibility for advancing the narrative that Riley was what many at the
2490120	2495640	time regarded as a trans-trender, the political leeches. However, she also expands on the reasoning
2495640	2499720	for what led her to such a conclusion, which I personally find a little dubious.
2499720	2503880	One of the biggest things that I took issue with was that I assumed that Riley was taking on
2503880	2510440	a transgender identity and label for political purposes, a trans-trender. Now, I had a lot of
2510440	2515560	reasons to believe this. The first being statements from Riley about growing up and never questioning
2516200	2522040	their gender. As a trans person myself, that's very weird to hear, because growing up, my earliest
2522040	2527480	memories in life were that of questioning my gender and of questioning the gender role that I
2527480	2532920	was expected to fill. So, as a trans person, I couldn't get in the headspace of what? How did you
2532920	2538360	never question it? Another example is Riley's statements that trans people don't always want to
2538360	2543960	transition. And again, as a trans person who's known many trans people, I couldn't wrap my head
2543960	2550360	around that because, for me, the transition was incredibly paramount. It was the key to me living
2550360	2554520	the fulfilled life that I live now. I was also under the assumption, as hundreds of thousands
2554600	2560760	of other people were, that Riley had no desire to transition and that Riley was not transitioning,
2560760	2564920	that Riley was just taking on the label of trans with no real action behind it.
2564920	2569880	In retrospect, it's easy to say these justifications seem rather flimsy. Anyone may grow up without
2569880	2574280	questioning certain aspects of their identity, particularly in certain environments, and to doubt
2574280	2578840	the veracity of a person's gender because they have the courage to admit that seems extremely
2578840	2583320	cynical. And Blair's other reason basically being that she went along with the mass consensus is
2583320	2587960	barely a reason at all. Nonetheless, she had to explain her rationale whether it made sense or
2587960	2592040	not. If that was the impression she received, then so be it. And once that was out of the way,
2592040	2595800	she cut to the chase. And to be fair, her reflection is pretty strong and suitably
2595800	2602040	self-critical. But the incessant push to prove that Riley was not trans and just realizing
2602840	2606920	was probably really hurtful. And I'm aware that there's no way I would have known before the
2606920	2611960	video where Riley actually discloses this information, but I feel like I was still in
2611960	2616280	the wrong for trying to assume what was in someone's heart and mind when there was just
2616280	2621080	simply no way I could have known. And make no mistake, it should have been. In many ways,
2621080	2625640	it was starting to sink in that there was a toxicity in this online community that she was
2625640	2630040	contributing to. Beyond just the narratives of making assumptions about transgender individuals
2630040	2633400	deciding who is truly trans or not, there are other statements she had made. For example,
2633400	2639000	this one towards fellow trans woman Steph Sanjati in 2016. When Steph tagged another trans woman to
2639000	2643640	ask why Blair has to attack their appearance when she clearly has no clue what she's doing,
2643640	2647720	Blair decides to jump in on the statement to inform Steph that she looks like a linebacker,
2647720	2652840	is so extra and unnecessary. In this specific case, I think Blair misconstrued Steph's comment
2652840	2656920	as an attack on her appearance rather than just going out of her way to offend, but it was
2656920	2662360	indicative of how antagonistic she had become, how skeptical her own perception towards many of
2662360	2667000	those she shared experiences with was. A much worse situation included her making a rather
2667000	2671400	mean-spirited comment in response to a video by a person who was posting about her own experiences,
2671400	2674520	once again, going at her ability to pass as a woman.
2675400	2679320	So one thing has become pretty apparent since starting my YouTube channel, and that is that the
2679320	2684600	trans community hates me. Throughout her time on YouTube, she had made a deal about being the
2684600	2689480	public enemy of many of these trans women, how they hated her, how some couldn't be as good looking,
2689480	2693400	how they weren't as pretty, and beyond all the complex theories that could arise as to why she
2693400	2697960	did this, it was simply rather catty behavior. As her platform grew, having such demeanor that
2697960	2701720	could influence the actions of viewers, particularly towards the subjects of her videos,
2701720	2706440	some of whom transgender, this could easily cause unintended grief, and Blair wouldn't want that,
2706440	2710360	especially as someone who had experienced that personally. With reference to the video about
2710360	2714520	misgendering, she was at risk of becoming everything she had criticized in the past.
2714520	2719880	At the end of the day, personal ideology transcends identity, so singling transgender people out in the
2719880	2723480	way that Blair did on the basis of political disagreements alone wasn't really the most
2723480	2725000	salubrious for either party.
2725000	2730600	And I'm someone who's had my transition picked apart online. There have been Reddit threads
2730600	2735160	and 4chan threads with hundreds of comments on it of people trying to prove that I'm not trans
2735160	2740920	because I haven't done this or that, or, you know, digging up my old pictures, and, you know,
2743000	2747400	I'm a strong person, I'm a happy person, but to sit here and pretend like it doesn't affect me
2747400	2754520	at all would just be a lie. So the thought that this entire time I've done that exact same thing
2755160	2762280	to someone else, and pushed that off on someone else, f*** with me, and I'm f***ing sorry.
2762280	2765720	Now, I think there were some who probably doubted the sincerity of this apology.
2765720	2769560	At the end of the day, this was an narrative maintained over a year by an individual who,
2769560	2773160	given her own self-admitted personal experiences, should have known better,
2773160	2776840	have at the same time as a person who did have some authority within the community,
2776840	2780840	speaking out on the matter would at least cause some to listen to her who may not otherwise
2780840	2785960	relented. Maybe the growth and the community she was in had taken her on a bit of a power trip,
2785960	2788680	and this was the warranted yank back down to earth she needed.
2788680	2794840	You know, this whole thing has really taught me a lesson that I should really try to stick to ideas,
2794840	2802200	opinions, policy, rather than, like, trying to get in someone's head and, like, make judgments
2802200	2807080	about something that's so personal and so nuanced.
2807080	2811320	To many, this appeared to be a turning point in Blair's content, as she committed to making
2811320	2816120	her videos more focused on their political roots, and gravitating away from the petty remarks and
2816120	2820520	character judgments that had landed her in hot water this time. Whether Riley accepted it herself
2820520	2824360	we'll never know, though she did upload a video just over a month later discussing how to make
2824360	2828600	a good apology video. Although not mentioning Blair's video at any point, and using a different
2828600	2832920	example completely to illuminate her thesis, it was a bit coincidental for some, and seemingly
2832920	2837480	reignited the feud between the two creators, even causing the video to be temporarily taken down
2837480	2842520	in the process due to flagging. Fantastic. But deep breaths, Blair still had a new leaf to turn over,
2842520	2846920	we were going to talk about political content, and a bit of a Twitter spat between old nemeses
2846920	2851480	isn't substantial enough to say that she had returned to old habits, no. As the content went,
2851480	2856280	it looked like there was a new direction for Blair, and to be honest, maybe it was the fresh start
2856280	2856920	she needed.
2861560	2866520	I'm going to open this part by at least defending Blair White to a certain degree, I know, I even
2866520	2871400	surprise myself sometimes. As much as I have detailed aspects of her channel, and her behaviour
2871400	2875640	in a pretty critical light, it's important to recognise the zeitgeist, and how that may have
2875640	2880040	influenced her comportment. I know that to many people, even myself, that it may have seemed like
2880040	2884360	she was pandering to seek approval from the online crowd, but throughout that period, and even up to
2884360	2888680	this day, one of the prevalent narratives espoused by individuals from within this realm was that
2888680	2893960	these ideas were the counterculture. This was a pushback against the mainstream ideologies enforced
2893960	2899160	by oppressive neoterics who didn't even want to allow room for discussion. Blair had been there
2899160	2904200	herself, she'd set foot in the liberal university campuses, and encountered that environment first
2904200	2909560	hand. That edginess that some wanted to shut down was part of that movement, it was greater back
2909560	2914040	then. In her own mind, Blair may have felt she was the one fighting back by saying what she said,
2914040	2918120	she was joining the resistance, and this attitude that she adopted was part of that movement. That
2918120	2922920	she wasn't pandering, she was adapting, and many other people did the same. Channels from all genres
2922920	2926760	probably said stuff they would never be caught saying to date, many commentators being no
2926760	2931320	exception. Here, the idea lingered that maybe some of Blair's antics were in part a product of their
2931320	2935480	era, like some of the other creators who had also been in that position as well, and had since
2935480	2940120	reformed themselves. How this would only be answered by a content, and how it would develop in relation
2940120	2944600	to the evolving YouTube ecosystem. With the observed incident grounding her, this would definitely
2944600	2946600	be a chance to realign those values.
2946600	2951720	I'm not infallible, I've definitely, you know, over the course of doing political commentary for the
2951720	2956520	past almost two years, I know I've probably said things that are not true, thinking they were true,
2956520	2962680	I've definitely accidentally spread fake news, and I'm definitely not calling myself a fact machine.
2962680	2967800	2017 was an interesting time, in my opinion, it was when the pushback against presiding
2967800	2971320	anti-SJW narratives on YouTube began to gather momentum,
2971320	2977560	and the science says we're all on a spectrum, um, no, um,
2983000	2986760	this didn't necessarily quell the strength of certain commentators, but it definitely meant that
2986760	2990680	a lot of discourse appeared to grow more balanced, with certain perspectives no longer going
2990680	2995960	unchallenged. Alongside this, with certain US policy in particular skewing in concerning directions,
2995960	3000440	it became more difficult for some to argue that conservatism was this oppressed political
3000440	3005000	underdog. However, there was never an absence of content to tune online, for a creator of any
3005000	3010360	leading, and Blair was never starved for content. Blair never positioned herself as a disillusioned
3010360	3014440	liberal like some of her colleagues, she was a conservative, and rather proud of the fact.
3014440	3019240	Nonetheless, there were a few key issues that she liked to weigh in on, ones that didn't necessarily
3019240	3024200	fall too clearly on a liberal-conservative spectrum, more coming down to questions of common sense,
3024200	3028280	and in the months following her apology to Riley Dennis, she appeared to readjust her trajectory,
3028280	3031880	to present a more balanced perspective on political affairs that would reflect the current
3031880	3037480	landscape. According to police reports, and not sensationalized headlines, this occurred in a
3037480	3042440	private residence, in an apartment, and it just happened to have occurred in a bathroom, and the
3042440	3047720	person was a family friend. It was not stranger danger, it was not stranger trannies in the
3047720	3053720	bathroom gonna get you danger, it just wasn't. Ian Miles Chong claimed straight up that it happened
3053720	3058120	in a public bathroom. For example, this video corrects misinformation surrounding a transgender
3058120	3062280	individual convicted of sexual assault, and the factually incorrect claims made by someone on the
3062280	3066840	right that this had occurred in a public restroom. Or we could talk about the upload at the start of
3066840	3071000	2018, where she reacted to some of her older content that she no longer associates with,
3071000	3075320	and although still being somewhat mitigated in her self-criticism, still demonstrates awareness
3075320	3079320	of her errors. So there's been a bunch of pictures and videos that have come out that have led people
3079320	3084040	to believe that she has some sort of neurological disorder, or, you know, she's generally just
3084040	3087880	unfit to be president because she's ill. By the way, I still think Hillary Clinton is
3087880	3092760	actually the devil, but I regret doing this video. She may have very well been sick,
3092760	3099160	but the evidence I used in this video is reaching at best. It's so flimsy, it's so weak,
3099720	3104680	and I'm surprised more people didn't call me out on it, honestly. All of these examples show growth
3104680	3108840	from previous incidents, hopefully allowing her to move towards being a more recent and
3108840	3113080	independent voice within the community. Throughout this period, Blair also seemed to pivot back
3113080	3117320	towards more introspective videos that spoke about her personal life and development in her
3117320	3121480	transition. There was a fair bit that warranted praise, and I don't want to understate that.
3121480	3125240	At the same time, there were still signs that aspects of her content indulged perspectives
3125240	3130120	without being fully transparent in the delivery of that information, such as the Trump hat in
3130120	3131080	Hollywood video.
3131080	3135640	Hey guys, so today is a bit of a different kind of video. We're doing a social experiment video.
3135640	3141080	You guys know I've been doing on the street stuff, and Joey and I had this sick idea of walking
3141080	3147160	around West Hollywood, which is the gay area of Hollywood, and just, you know, wearing a little
3148120	3149960	hat that we think people would be really upset about.
3149960	3161560	Now, on the surface, this is a standard intolerant left video, and obviously, when witnessing violence
3161560	3165960	against someone, many would feel naturally shocked. In the description, a disclaimer sits informing
3165960	3170280	viewers that Blair and her partner did not act in any way that would have provoked the attacks,
3170280	3174520	implying the hats were the only variable of interest here. This caught the eye of many on
3174520	3179480	social media given its content, and led to some circulation and interest from those outside her
3179560	3184200	typical audience. Nonetheless, this also reached the fact checking website Snopeskin, who contacted
3184200	3187880	the Los Angeles Police Department, and were informed that Blair and her husband had crossed the
3187880	3193000	dividing line set up specifically to prevent any physical altercation. Now, does this justify the
3193000	3197800	behavior of those depicted in the video? No, but at the same time, it's hardly wearing a Trump hat
3197800	3202840	in Hollywood, moreover, wearing it to an anti-Trump protest. I'll add the caveat that she does have a
3202840	3206840	drink thrown in her face at the end of the video, which, although Snopes cast suspicion on comparing
3206840	3210840	her to Alex Jones, I don't really think it's completely fair, and could well have happened.
3210840	3214280	At the same time, given the framing, doubt is obviously going to be inevitable, and given how
3214280	3218840	heavily edited the video is, it's hard to arbitrate exactly what happened, but maybe that's just
3218840	3222840	clickbait for you. Nonetheless, certain concerns, however, go beyond a single video.
3223720	3230920	You know, these other beasts, let me not say beasts, but these other people who are pressuring
3230920	3235400	people to be with them, it's growth. Yes, I'd say there are still comments present that showcased
3235400	3240280	her rather flippant nature and desire to one-up those she viewed unfavorably, but these were asides
3240280	3245480	and a far cry from what she had perpetuated in the past. We can all be divas from time to time,
3245480	3246200	can't we?
3246200	3250600	I mean, let's be honest, most of the people who complain about this kind of thing are the worst
3250600	3255960	people, the most undateable, cringy, miserable individuals, just very tacky.
3255960	3260440	Well, I don't know, but as we move further into 2018, she seemed to distance herself more and more
3260440	3264200	from the political community that she had previously shared propriety with. Her content
3264200	3267800	gravitated towards topics that felt more vlog-oriented in a way, and this inevitably
3267800	3271960	yielded some questions from viewers who were familiar with her more outspoken self. Although
3271960	3276280	I think many were expecting a new direction, this certainly was a different flavour. Eventually,
3276280	3280440	she'd upload a video explaining exactly why she'd done this, and the reasons behind it,
3280440	3283560	and to be fair to her, many of them seemed quite justified and believable.
3284200	3288760	So the simplest answer as to why I've steered away from politics, at least recently, and at least for
3288760	3294760	now, maybe not forever, is that quite frankly, I guess just the best way to put it is politics,
3295400	3303240	and political commentary specifically, has effed up my life. The FBI incidents, the going out in
3303240	3308360	public and having people try to fight me, the doxing, the stalking, the people entering my
3308360	3315480	building, all that kind of stuff, my family being harassed, and you know, I am at such a place where
3315480	3322600	I feel like, has it been worth it? I moved to LA almost a year ago, and one thing about LA is
3322600	3328120	there's a lot of work here, so a lot of other political commentators, other people who you guys
3328120	3332040	know, I'm not talking about obscure people here, a lot of them either live in LA or they're
3332040	3338200	constantly in and out for work, filming something, doing whatever they do, so I've met almost all of
3338200	3342760	them. People have either been on their show, or on a show with them, or I went to a dinner with them,
3342760	3347160	an event with them, or I became close with some of them. The amount of them that I've met that
3347160	3353080	have told me either directly or in a roundabout way that's very clear, that they don't believe
3353080	3356600	everything that they say that they believe when they're on camera, a lot of them just flat out
3356600	3363000	don't believe, they're just actors. Grifters, threats, doctors, they're all plausible in such
3363000	3367640	a polarizing community with such potential, and if you can't handle that, then it's understandable
3367640	3371880	that you'd want to take a step back. It'd make anyone feel rather dirty once they've been exposed
3371880	3376360	to it long enough, and the video itself feels like Blair finally washing her hands of such
3376360	3382120	toxicity. This was the movement we needed. BLAIR It comes in such extremes, it's like something
3382120	3386520	really amazing will happen, and I'll get like the coolest opportunity ever, but then something
3386520	3392120	really effing terrible will happen, and it's these crazy highs and lows that I feel like are a lot
3392120	3397960	more extreme than if I just did other types of content that make me equally as happy, you know?
3398600	3411480	But were those hands as clean as they appeared?
3415480	3420360	BLAIR That venting session was so necessary. When I say it was so necessary, it was so
3421400	3427240	necessary. It felt amazing. The video about why Blair changed seemed pretty conclusive in the
3427240	3432040	moment, rather scaling towards many aspects of the community and even the media beyond that,
3432040	3436120	ending on a rather affirmative note that would cause many to assume that she was mostly finished
3436120	3449880	with political content, at least for a while. However, it seems the contrary appeared to be the
3449880	3454600	case. In fact, it looked as though Blair's open venting made her feel more reassured in returning
3454600	3458920	topics that she had distanced herself from, and after a month interval, she returned to a schedule
3458920	3463240	of more politically oriented content. I'm not entirely sure why, it's not like many of the
3463240	3468120	concerns that she had outlined in her video could subside. In fact, you could argue her shedding
3468120	3472200	light on them had only heightened the attention they could receive, but if that's how she felt,
3472200	3477080	then that's her prerogative. BLAIR Hi, so I know I said in the last video that I wasn't gonna talk
3477080	3483080	about politics anymore. That was a lie. I'm a liar, because women lie. Just kidding, that was
3483080	3488840	a joke, and probably not fitting for this video, but… Well, I appreciate the honesty, Blair. Her
3488840	3493080	first video back was a response to the slogan Believe All Women, a rather contentious phrase
3493080	3497720	which some advocates claim has been unfairly conflated with the similar, though not identical,
3497720	3502360	Believe Women. As you can probably assume, Blair's position on the slogan was unsurprisingly quite
3502360	3506360	critical, though not necessarily making the distinction mentioned prior. Nevertheless,
3506360	3510360	the video was well received, and she appeared to return to her routine schedule of content.
3510360	3514600	This may have spiked some unease amongst those still skeptical of her intentions, especially
3514600	3520040	considering some of the clickbait and chosen subjects, but hope may have been instilled as
3520040	3524200	she appeared to stand by her reformed demeanor and refrain from shabby character attacks,
3524200	3528440	even reconciling with one of the individuals she had previously been rather insensitive towards,
3528440	3533160	and recognising her responsibility. So all in all, we could say there was progress made, correct?
3533800	3539000	Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves, because again, as time elapsed, it felt like this was
3539000	3544360	waning. So today I have one of the cringiest videos I have seen in a long time on the
3544360	3549240	interweb. I mean, the content itself was still lightweight at best and a bit misleading at the
3549240	3553800	worst. I know it's kind of Blair's style to not create the most demanded content, but conversely,
3553800	3558040	I think there are videos which just end up failing rather in their portrayal of the source material,
3558040	3562280	and once again fall back onto this idea of catering to a perspective. Now, obviously,
3562280	3566520	anyone would be pleased that her content is less incendiary than it was before, but at the same
3566520	3570920	time, having many prominent flaws and just subtracting the evident offensiveness previously
3570920	3576120	present doesn't necessarily make it good. And make no mistake, there isn't a great divergence
3576120	3583080	from precursory output. This video where she responds to a notoriously unpopular Teen Vogue
3583080	3595080	upload. Now, there are certainly points in the original that could be disputed,
3595080	3598040	but a load of Blair's arguments are pretty lazy, too.
3598040	3604680	Blair- This idea that the body is either male or female is totally wrong, and I am living proof of
3604680	3611720	that. She literally just said that she's proof of that and didn't explain why. Like, it went on to
3611720	3617320	the next scene. Blair, she literally elaborates on this later on in the section. Blair- I identify
3617320	3623560	as an intersex woman. I have gone through surgeries that have really stuck with me through
3623640	3629960	my whole life and affected a lot of different parts of my life just so that I can fit into this box
3629960	3635240	of female. The video's over seven minutes long, and these segments are even shorter, so you'd need
3635240	3639960	to have a pretty short attention span to miss it. And as said, it's not an infallible upload,
3639960	3645000	but she skips over so much of it and responds to the parts where she can drop a sassy takedown
3645000	3649480	comment, some which doesn't even work in the greater context of the original video. Another
3649480	3653960	example would be the classic The Mob Tried To Cancel Me Again upload, where Blair is rather
3653960	3659240	angry that an event she was part of hosted by Walk Away, a prominent LGBT movement promoting
3659240	3663320	exodus of the Democratic Party, was moved last minute due to an open letter and accompanying
3663320	3667720	dossier published by online communities, documenting what they had deemed as behaviour
3667720	3672840	contrary to the values of the venue hosting the event. She initially scolded the LGBT Center for
3672840	3677160	their decision to refuse their guests, and all the fans they would inevitably put out of pocket with
3677160	3681160	the impending cancellation, a comment that some would deem slightly ironic given that she was
3681160	3685000	accused of doing the same one and a half years prior for a debate with their admirer and
3685000	3689720	contrapoints, another trans creator on the left of the spectrum whom she had debated previously.
3689720	3694120	However, that was a while back, and so was a lot of what she had been accused of in this dossier,
3694120	3696520	so she took to YouTube to defend herself.
3696520	3701640	Today I am going to be addressing the mob, but more specifically, what I wanted to address in
3701640	3707000	this video is the petition that was sent to the LGBT Center from activists online to have me
3707000	3712120	deplatformed. The petition and what they were saying was absolutely just riddled with
3712120	3718040	misrepresentations, lies, exaggerations, and just bullshit about me. So we're going to go over some
3718040	3722600	pictures right now that people love to bring up when they're trying to ruin something for me.
3722600	3727640	People are claiming that that photo is me holding up a white supremacist hand signal. So to address
3727640	3733080	that specifically, so stupid I have to, this is again an okay hand signal. This is not a white
3733080	3737720	supremacist hand signal. In the video, however, Blair picks out two isolated examples from the
3737720	3742280	document in question, and even then somehow manages to take one of them out of context.
3742280	3747400	So here's another photo people love digging up from 2016, a photo of me apparently in blackface.
3748440	3752520	This is all well and good, but she's omitted the caption, and this caption was present in the
3752520	3757240	document, so there's no real reason to do this otherwise unless you view it as strictly irrelevant
3757400	3761720	to the discourse, which I would find unlikely personally. Now, does this make the offense
3761720	3766440	terrible or even comparable to a lot of what is normally considered blackface? Not necessarily,
3766440	3770600	because if you donned it with the primary intent of being a beauty treatment, then that's important
3770600	3775000	information. However, it was still posted to social media as a reference to blackface,
3775000	3779240	and that is of interest, and Blair was aware of that. However, instead, we have to deal with the
3779240	3783800	incredulous tone and touch from the astounded commentator who puts all these bottom feeders
3783800	3795400	in their place. It's strange to me because it doesn't seem like a point that's impossible to
3795400	3800600	respond to in its full context, and yet it was still watered down. Even with this considered,
3800600	3804360	there's a lot of the document that Blair just doesn't respond to at all. Some of it I can
3804360	3808280	understand, she doesn't consider it a big deal. Other parts, well.
3813800	3832840	When videos are like this, I just wonder why they're even made at all, and maybe that's what
3832840	3837160	I get for making videos as long as I do. Yet, it seemed for every step Blair took forward,
3837160	3840840	they were offset by shortcomings that could have been alleviated if she'd been a bit more
3840840	3845000	meticulous or upfront in the material she presented, and that for someone who valued facts
3845000	3849640	and information so much, they could really be lacking sometimes, for the most pointless reasons
3849640	3854680	as well. It's hard to fully diagnose what was going on, because it never felt fully malicious,
3854680	3858440	just very lackluster, and I received the impression that maybe Blair was becoming
3858440	3863320	tired of her content, maybe she was on autopilot, maybe she needed a new calling.
3863320	3867160	Well, as we move deeper into 2019, it seems she may have found it.
3878200	3882120	So, I guess it's time to introduce a side character, this is an individual by the name of
3882120	3886520	Jessica Yaniv. She first hit the headlines in mid-2019 after filing multiple complaints with
3886520	3891000	the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal as she was refused Brazilian waxes by beauticians,
3891000	3894920	and seeking damages from each individual involved. She claimed this was discrimination
3894920	3899480	on the basis of her transgender identity, however, the defendants contested they were not comfortable
3899480	3903880	or experienced with her genitalia, which included a phallus. There's a lot that takes my interest
3903880	3907720	regarding this case that could be discussed in the future, but for now, all I'll say is that there
3907720	3912040	are many that understandably didn't sympathize with her plight, and questioned her intentions
3912040	3915880	in initiating these proceedings given certain details. Additionally, others following the
3915880	3920200	situation decided to dig further into her antics, discovering a consistent pattern of rather
3920200	3925240	inappropriate and predatory behaviour, provoking condemnation and backlash towards the controversial
3925240	3929720	figure. However, it appears there was another person with an eye on the debacle, Blair White.
3929720	3933480	Now, Blair had perhaps signaled her intent to pursue a new direction a week before,
3933480	3938120	although once again not in the most graceful form, after she had confused a Twitter user by the name
3938120	3942760	of Princess Steph with a TikTok predator by the name of Mama Steph, in full-fledged serving the
3942760	3947000	wrong Chris Hansen style. She had deleted these tweets shortly after realising her error, though
3947080	3952120	I'm not ever sure if amends were made. Nonetheless, a good few days later, she probably felt on more
3952120	3956840	sure-footing as she launched a pretty extensive attack on Yaniv, who she branded decisively in
3956840	3959000	her upload as the Trans-Predator.
3959000	3968440	This week, this is trans activist Jessica Yaniv. Now, this person is the walking, talking, living and breathing
3968440	3975560	embodiment of what people fear when it comes to trans people. I do not believe this is a trans woman.
3975560	3981160	I believe this is a predator posing as a trans woman. Now, make no mistake, none of these messages
3981160	3987400	are how women talk to each other or trans women talk to women or anyone. Yaniv clearly has an
3987400	3994040	obsession with, you know, feminine products and women and girls, and it's incredibly disturbing,
3994040	3995720	and this needs to be called out.
3995720	4000120	The video delineates the evidence accumulated against Jessica, while also discussing the greater
4000120	4004680	impact on the trans community, and how the general public may regard it, lambasting the activists
4004680	4006360	who haven't spoken out.
4006360	4012120	"-This. Why are you silent when this type of thing comes up? This should be part of your job.
4012120	4016840	It should be part of your job as an activist who wants to apparently put trans people in a better
4016840	4022600	light and better social standing. It is important for us to distance ourselves from this. I'm not
4022600	4027320	here to police what, you know, other trans public figures do with their social media and with their
4027320	4033080	platform, but they seem to complain about a lot of stuff, right? And I know they've seen this.
4033080	4039800	So maybe to those people, I would ask when you're writing, you know, your 17th tweet about how bad I
4039800	4044600	am, maybe use one tweet to be like, that's not us. This is horrible."
4044600	4048360	In many ways, these assertions don't feel out of place for a standard Blair White video,
4048360	4052360	but the narrative of exposing someone for such egregious behavior appeared to provide it with
4052360	4057240	greater moral foundations, attracting praise from a broad spectrum of viewers, and Craig galvanizing
4057240	4061560	her ratings and engagement like seldom before. And when a formula works, and you seem to be
4061560	4064520	enjoying it like Blair was, you pursue it a bit further.
4064520	4070440	I feel like this channel is becoming a predator hunter channel, and I'm actually 100% okay with it.
4070440	4074520	So a few more videos go up on the matter. A couple of these continue to follow the Yuneve saga,
4074520	4078760	including a blatant live stream in which both the participants clash heads pretty explosively.
4078760	4082520	They discuss a medley of subjects, with Blair occasionally just driving home the very
4082520	4086920	pertinent point of how much more attractive than Jessica she is, instead of merely calling Yuneve
4086920	4088200	out for her blatant bigotry.
4112760	4116520	Overall though, I think it does contain some interesting character indictments about Yuneve
4117000	4121000	so I won't complain too much on that front. However, some may begin to question this general
4121000	4125480	direction on the basis that Blair's content was portraying transgender individuals in a negative
4125480	4130040	light. After all, what does a person's identity have to do with how they behave? Well, in another
4130040	4134440	video about an individual who Blair believed to be enacting sexual roleplay disguised as transgender
4134440	4137000	activism, she appears to explain this justification.
4137000	4142680	But what we don't need is people who are not even trans, enacting this predatory behaviour under the
4142680	4148120	guise of being trans, under the blanket, the protection of being trans, really. People like
4148120	4154440	Jessica Yuneve and people like Stephanie actually use the trans label as a protective force field
4154440	4159240	to stop people from criticising their predatory behaviour. It's not who they are, it is their
4159240	4163640	scapegoat. Similar to her Jessica Yuneve video, it's clear that she feels there are certain people
4163720	4168280	who are masquerading their rather sick depravity under the veil of the transgender label, and as a
4168280	4172760	transgender person herself, Blair wants nothing to do with that, she wants to let people know that
4172760	4177160	such behaviour has no place in her community. I suppose it's an understandable sentiment when you
4177160	4181320	have an activist community who you want to set yourself apart from, but I think you also have to
4181320	4186120	be wary that you avoid perpetuating the conflation yourself, that you're not just pouring fuel onto
4186120	4190600	the fire to then try and put it out. Blair seemed pretty pleased with this direction, even dropping
4190600	4195320	an Onision video in the process, who isn't trans as far as I know, how there were still
4195320	4200040	a couple red flags that maybe she was a bit too emboldened by her newfound penchant for exposing
4200040	4204840	people. Blair and drag queens are brought into public libraries, elementary schools, preschools,
4204840	4210680	kindergartens, to read to children, and they come in drag, and it's supposed to be this thing that's
4210680	4219480	very mind-opening for children, it's just this super woke thing. So meet this man, Albert Garza,
4219480	4224920	drag queen performer, has performed numerous times at Drag Queen Story Hour to underage young
4224920	4231560	children, and what do you know, he's a convicted predator, but is somehow still allowed to read to
4231560	4236520	children as a drag queen. In this video, she decided to cover a predator who was participating
4236520	4240680	in the drag queen program, providing it with a title as endearing as ever. However, when
4240680	4244600	initially released, it had this thumbnail. What's the problem? Well, the problem is that this drag
4244600	4249080	queen in the thumbnail has nothing to do with any of the charges actually mentioned in the video.
4249080	4253320	In fact, the only acknowledgement of this person is at the start, where they're once again so
4253320	4257560	tastefully placed alongside the news report of the actual offender's conviction.
4257560	4263640	Bringing drag performers together with little kids is kind of a perfect relationship. I'm hoping what
4263640	4271960	the kids get out of coming to story time is an opportunity to see that things that are different
4271960	4276280	aren't scary. Relationships and gender identities and everything.
4276280	4280920	A revelation that a registered sex offender participated in a story time for children might
4280920	4285080	be surprising in and of itself. When called out for this, Blair did make the change relatively
4285080	4289240	quickly, but it does lead one to wonder how many times this can happen. I don't really like the
4289240	4293000	video much either. It felt like the reservoir for such content was already running dry,
4293000	4299080	especially given the fact that the video once again just sucks. And to make matters worse,
4300040	4306200	there's a library board in Wichita that can't seem to agree. They can't come to a clear consensus
4306680	4312600	on whether or not convicted child predators should be reading to their kids as drag queens.
4312600	4318440	I'm not joking. It's a thing. This article states board members were split between those who said
4318440	4323160	registered sex offenders should be automatically disqualified from ever giving a talk at the
4323160	4332120	library and those who said it should be allowable in some circumstances. What circumstances is it
4332200	4338680	okay for a predator to speak to kids? Blair, have you heard of scrolling down?
4338680	4343560	It's literally written there in the article. The exceptions that could be considered. You can
4343560	4349400	disagree or dispute them, but you can't act like they don't exist and get all hot and bothered when
4349400	4357960	they're right there. Talk about due diligence. Deep breaths. Focus. Focus. But what I am saying,
4357960	4363080	which is what something that LGBT advocates don't seem to ever get through their head,
4363080	4369320	is that sometimes you guys are so lax and so interested in being woke that you leave the
4369320	4376920	door open for this. Stop. Like I hate to constantly get all think of the children on you,
4376920	4381960	but think of the children. Okay. I have to admit that I'm feeling rather faint and
4381960	4385960	I need to sleep this frustration off.
4385960	4415560	Okay, let's regather myself. Where were we? Nobody likes predatory behavior. It can be pretty much
4415560	4419480	universally denounced, and Blair going after people who had acted in such a way was a gold
4419480	4424040	mine, whether always completely accurate in the assertions she made or not. However, it also
4424040	4428600	bestowed Blair with power that she'd previously not been accustomed with, this social gravitas,
4428600	4433400	a currency of credibility that extended beyond a political plea. This like complete change of heart,
4433400	4440040	if in person you weren't so fake. I continue seeing how fraudulent they are and how gross of a
4440040	4447000	community or genre of content that is. Um, it's starting to again affect my willingness to be
4447000	4451800	part of that community. And obviously all doesn't mean literally all. There's two or three good ones,
4451800	4458840	but the overwhelming majority and those people that you guys know are just liars.
4458840	4463080	Now, when she made the video about why she changed, it may not have served her channel
4463080	4467000	much purpose in the context of the political content that followed almost immediately after,
4467000	4471000	but it did begin to cement a distancing from certain highly polarizing figures that,
4471000	4475000	throughout much of the channel's early stages, she found herself rather congenial with. The
4475000	4480120	political community that was once rather tight knit in 2016 had definitely divided itself in the
4480120	4485480	years ensuing, to those who had become more amenable to leftism like Sean Head, for example,
4485480	4489800	and those who were still quite resistant to it. And this would only become more lucid as time
4489800	4495320	transpired. Both of them very much. I really do like both of them, but it's become obvious that
4495320	4501720	Sean Head is becoming radicalized towards communism. And in fact, I, with my burner
4501720	4505480	accounts on Twitter, tweeted at her, look, dude, by the end of the year at this rate,
4505480	4509960	you're going to be a communist. And she replied with never, and then deleted that tweet. And
4510520	4518600	all we see now is this radical cascade into what appears to be just full communism. And I'm just
4518600	4523400	staggered by it. Blair was no different in this sense, at least. 2016 Blair hung around with a
4523400	4527800	very different crew than her 2019 entourage. The strange detail in Blair's situation is that she
4527800	4531640	maintained a lot of her narratives that remain critical of communities that she'd always been
4531640	4535880	outspoken about. However, pairing them with topics that expose predators appeared to win over a
4535880	4539640	larger audience and push her more into the mainstream. Finishing this saga off on the
4539640	4544920	Onision video was a fitting end, especially given the apolitical nature of despising him. Hating
4544920	4549320	people who behave in such a manner transcends politics. And even if you don't agree with
4549320	4553560	Blair, a lot of people found it in themselves to look past their differences to support her
4553560	4558040	crusade. In a way, it's what finally made her mainstream, which is a pretty incredible feat,
4558040	4561960	considering less than a few months ago she was lamenting cancellation of the walk away event
4561960	4566920	due to the antics of her and her peers, and her continued involvement with that movement since.
4566920	4571320	However, as soon as she'd embraced her new direction, she once again shifted course back
4571320	4575960	to more political content. This was fair enough, I suppose. She likely would have received flack
4575960	4579560	for over stigmatising the community if she'd only spoken out the worst of the worst through
4579560	4584280	her archetypal lens. On the flip side, though, there wasn't any greater cause that could shield
4584280	4588840	her from criticism for shortcomings that may be present in her content, so it was more imperative
4588840	4593640	than ever that she be rigorous and balanced in her presentation. Was she, though? Well, I mean,
4593640	4597800	let's tackle the three most prevalent issues with Blair White throughout this video so far.
4597800	4603160	Poor research, reckless insensitivity, and I suppose what many would regard as invalidation.
4603160	4607080	The last one you'd hope would be a mostly outdated criticism, given the fact that she'd
4607080	4610840	obviously acknowledged how unfair she'd been in the past towards trans women who didn't pass
4610840	4616040	enough in her eyes, and how she wanted to move back to more serious, sensible content. However,
4616040	4621000	the upload after this exposing phase, she uploaded a video called The Truth About Contrapoints and
4621000	4624920	Non-Binary, covering an incident that transpired in the political community at that time,
4624920	4628680	where Contra would face some pretty hostile resistance after expressing her predilection
4628680	4632200	towards attitudes and environments with a more traditional approach to gender roles over the
4632840	4637320	hyper-woke spaces. Obviously, this is a person sharing their experiences and thoughts, and even
4637320	4641080	if you disagree or think it could have been worded more sensitively, some people definitely
4641080	4645800	overreacted. However, Blair had her own take. Well, maybe her opinion has reformed since then.
4646520	4650680	Speaking of transition, from what I can see, the overwhelming majority of non-binary people
4650680	4654360	do not transition. They don't get surgery, they don't get hormones, etc. Of course,
4654360	4657880	there are some, and there's gonna be someone in the comments, I know of someone, okay, well,
4657880	4662520	you know of someone. In terms of gender, I have about as much in common with a non-binary person
4662520	4669080	as I do my fiancé, who is not trans, just a guy, because he stayed at point A, just like
4669080	4673880	non-binary people do. No, not really. In fact, her video is packed with a large set of assumptions
4673880	4679000	about the non-binary community, not really backed up with any proof or evidence, appearing kind of
4679000	4680200	pissed off, to be honest.
4680200	4684760	So, non-binary is a topic that comes up on my channel in passing, but I've never really gone
4684760	4689240	in-depth about my feelings towards non-binary people, non-binary as a concept,
4689240	4693640	in terms of gender, obviously, and this person insisted that they were trans as well. They were
4693640	4698440	the same thing as me, right? This person was born male, presents as male, has not transitioned to
4698440	4704200	anything but male, doesn't mind going by male pronouns, but yet I'm supposed to accept that I'm
4704200	4708440	the same thing as this person. I'm sorry, but I'm not.
4708440	4712600	I also can't really endorse her assertion that this is the first proper time she's made her feeling
4712600	4717160	apparent on the matter. I think she's been pretty clear, even in the midst of her hiatus from the
4717160	4720920	political community, she uploaded a video where she reacts to a non-binary individual with her
4720920	4725160	friend and fellow creator, Eden the Doll, and makes some pretty disparaging remarks, while also
4725160	4727560	continuously failing to address them correctly.
4727560	4732760	When you're assigned male at birth, you have to fight like f*** how to be feminine.
4732760	4735880	You have to fight like f*** how to be feminine.
4738040	4743400	He had to fight? What was your fight, girl? Picking the right shade of lipstick?
4743400	4747880	He's talking about a fight to be feminine when it's like, oh, a fight like surgery? Oh no,
4747880	4751320	he's not done that. A fight like hormones? No, he hasn't done that. A fight like therapy? Oh,
4751320	4754440	he hasn't done that. A fight like changing your name legally? Oh, he hasn't done that.
4754440	4759560	So what's the fight? I feel like whenever people says like to refer to them as they and them,
4760280	4764600	they're like kind of saying that they have like multiple personalities, like split personalities,
4764600	4769080	like a million people. She also chose this practically unknown non-binary person as the
4769080	4774600	quote, worse SJW over numerous other public figures in another video between then and now.
4774600	4778680	So here's one where she claims there is no such thing as male and female brains. That's what's
4778680	4783880	really, really annoying is you have all these random, honestly cisgender people claiming to
4783880	4788120	be trans to look cool and spreading out things like there's no such thing as male and female
4788120	4792520	brains. And then we find ourselves over here where she keeps reiterating the fact that non-binary
4792520	4796600	people are not the same as her, which is all well and good. I'm happy for her, but it's a
4796600	4801640	misleading point. Take a look at this very short clip in which I tell the non-binary individual
4801640	4806840	that we are not the same. My name is Blair. I'm transgender and I'm a Republican. My name is Jamie.
4806840	4812360	I use they, them pronouns, identifies a queer non-binary trans femme. I also identify in the
4812520	4819400	spectrum of asexuality. I believe non-binary is under the trans umbrella. I completely reject how
4819400	4824680	non-binary people specifically have injected themselves into the trans label. I am a
4824680	4828840	transsexual. There's a medical basis for that. There's a scientific basis for that. And for
4828840	4833080	non-binary, it's really not the case. You don't know my life. You don't know my experiences with
4833080	4838360	gender dysphoria. I'm not saying that you're the one that said that I was erasing you as trans.
4838360	4844120	And I, I am like, you're not trans. Like there's a medical definition of being a trans. I'm going
4844120	4849160	to stop you. Jamie, how are you doing? I'm okay. You're okay? Yeah. Do you feel like talking? You
4849160	4854520	don't have to. Okay. Blair plays this clip like it's some huge gotcha, but it actually just shows
4854520	4858600	the disparity between the two points she's trying to make. Someone has asserted they fall under the
4858600	4862520	umbrella and Blair disputes that, which is her prerogative, but that's not equatable to saying
4862520	4866520	that another person was claiming you were the same. In fact, they seek to emphasize they believe
4866520	4870920	in a more inclusive label that Blair seems rather bothered by. You can only reclaim that these two
4870920	4874920	points are compatible if you solely derive your identity from your trans label, something that
4874920	4879800	I'm sure Blair would never advocate for. No, I am not trying to bash non-binary people. I'm not
4879800	4883800	trying to say that I'm better than them, above them, higher than them. We all put our pants on
4883800	4887560	one leg at a time. We are all equals here. What I am saying is that we are different.
4888200	4893000	Okay. It seems to me that the goal of non-binary people is to completely destroy and deconstruct
4893000	4899160	the binary, and the goal of trans people is to operate within the binary, as in moving from one
4899160	4904520	to the other. Listen, guys, I'm talking about peace, love, understanding. I love everyone. We're all equal,
4904520	4908840	especially the greengrocers. I'm sure some of them are great people, but I'm pretty sure the
4908840	4912920	greengrocers are kidnapping cats and claiming the reward money when missing posters are put up. I have
4912920	4917560	to save some of this, but the point being, if you didn't like Blair before, she didn't seem to be
4917560	4923400	more sensitive, and when it came to validation, this is someone who is not trans. This is someone
4923400	4928840	who's claiming to be trans by what? Putting on lipstick and then going in the media talking about
4928840	4934120	trans issues as if they know. Well, if there's moving the goal posts, Blair was moving the gate
4934120	4939960	posts, but at least she still had her research sorted, right? Well, let's talk about it.
4947560	4956440	Okay, here's the thing. The first two points that we've discussed, Blair may defend herself on.
4956440	4961400	She never promoted herself as a bastion of sensitivity. On the contrary, in fact, she knows she's the
4961400	4965560	problematic queen. If she has strong opinions, she's going to express them, regardless of who she
4965560	4969320	offends. If you were going to criticise her, you could say that this sort of attitude makes her more
4969320	4974200	sensitive videos, such as her apology video to Riley Dennis, somewhat disingenuous.
4974200	4979000	There have been Reddit threads and 4chan threads with hundreds of comments on it, of people trying
4979000	4984040	to prove that I'm not trans because I haven't done this or that, or, you know, digging up my old
4984040	4991080	pictures, and, you know, I'm a strong person, I'm a happy person, but to sit here and pretend like it
4991080	4997080	doesn't affect me at all would just be a lie. However, even with that said, she may respond to this,
4997080	5001240	claiming that these two situations are not equivalent. After all, her whole point was that
5001240	5006200	non-binary individuals were not the same as her, and this mostly staved off the criticism, even if it
5006200	5011000	did feel like an us versus them narrative sometimes, no matter how much Blair declared there was no ill
5011000	5012200	will in her rhetoric.
5012200	5016440	And honestly, I know I'm gonna get crucified for this video, but I really don't care. My intention is not to,
5016440	5022600	again, bash, or put down, or belittle non-binary people. I really don't care what every way you identify as.
5022600	5024280	How about it?
5024280	5028360	We'll put this on the back burner for now, though, and turn our attention back to the third issue,
5028360	5033320	one that we wouldn't necessarily expect to be present in a video like this, that being poor research.
5033320	5038200	This is the one aspect of content that Blair wouldn't really have any defence against, after all, you can't
5038200	5043640	really dismiss it and say, deal with it, liberals, I'm bad at fact-checking. Intellectual rigour is to be
5043640	5048280	aspired for, regardless of political affiliation. However, in the aforementioned upload, not to be
5048280	5053080	outdone, Blair manages to tick all three boxes with a rather bizarre citation.
5053080	5060440	Another thing is that there is a long historical basis for transsexuals, like, as early as surgery was a thing,
5060440	5066680	people were having the desire to change their sex. Gender dysphoria, previously known as gender identity
5066680	5071720	disorder, is something that has been around forever, whereas this new wave of non-binary is literally
5071720	5076200	something that's popped up maybe since 2014 and on. Google Trends shows it.
5076200	5082120	Ah yes, Google Trends, the bulwark for scientific grounding. Now I personally use it, and I have used it,
5082120	5087240	for illustrating public interest or awareness of a trend, but not for the existence of an entity,
5087240	5091800	and Blair's assertion can be quickly challenged with a bit of actual research. For a video titled
5091800	5097080	The Truth About Contrapoints and Non-Binary, there isn't really much contrapoints, and there's also a
5097080	5102040	distinct lack of truth, though I'll give up points for having no deficiency on the non-binary front.
5102040	5106760	Recently, Sam Smith came out as non-binary and wants the entire world to use they-them pronouns,
5106760	5110600	because it wasn't enough to be Russian famous, he also wants everyone around to bow down and,
5110600	5112440	you know, change their language for him.
5112440	5116840	The videos that followed were no less brash, with her attitudes seemingly becoming more and more
5116840	5121240	impersonant, but I don't really want to focus on that, and let me make it clear, I could. We could
5121240	5125400	talk about the thumbnails that continue to feature people who have nothing to do with the video topic
5125400	5130040	and merely serve to allow Blair to pull her grossed out face, despite the fact she was literally just
5130040	5134200	called out for that, or we could talk about her ridiculous and pointless flame war with a smaller
5134200	5139240	creator where she once again resorts to insulting the person's trans identity regardless of what
5139240	5145080	they said. Just grow up. The antics that persisted after this, with the photoshopping and all that
5145080	5149800	crap, I have nothing else to add, it is self-explanatory at this point.
5149800	5162760	So, with all that behind us, let's talk about the children, a topic that has always been very close
5162760	5167720	to Blair's heart, and one that has also been the centre of gender discourse for a long time.
5167720	5172280	Certain commentators in particular take an interest because it's a sensitive and controversial topic
5172280	5177240	that has led to some mishaps in the past, and obviously, in these instances, there can be ramifications
5177240	5182680	of great moral significance. At the same time, with such topics, given their sensitivity, it requires
5182680	5186680	attention to detail, and respect for those who may be affected by the consequences such
5186680	5191160	narratives may invoke. Blair, like she did with a fair few other subjects, held a pretty cautious
5191160	5195560	stance on the matter, but mostly tried to talk about the issue from a perspective of common sense,
5195560	5200280	a safe bet with the internet at least. However, her track record on the subject wasn't the cleanest,
5200280	5204600	she had previously generated some controversy a few years back in a now-deleted video titled
5204600	5209080	Child Transitioning Equals Child Abuse, the title being the least provocative component.
5209080	5213800	In the infamous upload, she claims that the mother is pimping out her child's identity for profit.
5214360	5220280	Hm, what are the odds that a transgender activist gives birth to a kid who ends up being transgender?
5220280	5225160	Shocking coincidence, right? So then the question becomes, was she an ideologue before or after her
5225160	5231000	kid became trans? Well, her pinned tweet is of her doing a public talk years ago in which she
5231000	5236600	explains how her child transitioned at four. Four. A really quick Google of the mother shows that
5236600	5241400	she's been doing press and interviews and talks for years about her kid, and I'm sorry, but this
5241400	5247160	just reeks of pimping out your kid. She also has her own organization called Transparenting, she
5247160	5252440	sells t-shirts. I mean, this is lucrative for her, and I'm sure that this cover of National Geographic
5252440	5257880	is just her big brain. This was not just debatable, but frankly preposterous, and research showed that
5257880	5262760	the mother, who was the prime recipient of these characterizations, was practically the antithesis
5262760	5267160	of everything that Blair alleged, leaving many to arraign the creator for inducing a tidal wave of
5267160	5272520	hatred against a person who was merely trying to support her daughter. But okay, that was 2016,
5272520	5277480	Blair. This was 2019, I'm not going to give a spiel about the fact that she had a wider audience now
5277480	5281720	because we know that doesn't play a large role in dictating her narrative, but allow me to give a
5281720	5286680	brief preamble about this situation. Essentially, just under a couple of years back, a child became
5286680	5291560	the center of a political tug of war after the divorced parents disputed their gender. The father
5291560	5295720	in this family claimed that the mother was forcefully transitioning one of their children against
5295720	5300440	their will, setting up a page and fundraiser to fight the custody battle after a jury ruled against
5300440	5304920	him. This caught wind in the media and online conservative circles, causing the issue to become
5304920	5309640	quickly politicized as well, with one allegedly highly incriminating clip making the rounds, in
5309640	5312760	which the child claims the mother told them that they were a girl.
5312760	5314760	You're a boy, right?
5314760	5317760	No, I'm a girl.
5317760	5319760	Who told you you were a girl?
5319760	5320760	Mommy.
5320760	5325400	Blair decides to weigh in on this matter, after all, her personal investments run deep, and she delivers
5325400	5327880	a decisive verdict on the clip in question.
5327880	5333560	So you guys, this video to me is... I don't even want to get emotional, it's so sad. I think first of all,
5333560	5338360	you know, children going through custody battles and, you know, being weaponized by either party or
5338360	5343400	both parties and just going through that is so sad, and adding in this transgender layer, but you
5343400	5350120	know, I have to be honest, the child saying, my mom told me I'm a girl, um, not cool. Now, I've been
5350120	5355320	looking into this story and many people are saying that this child has been coached and is being
5355320	5360920	forced into this, and just based on what I have seen, I have to agree with that. That is personally
5360920	5361960	my opinion.
5361960	5366120	She then moves on to the regular narratives about the transgender community and the discussion about
5366120	5371160	putting children on hormones at the age of seven, and the dangerous, dangerous consequences it can have.
5371160	5375880	The institutions who have supported this and pushed it through and caused a great, great threat to this
5375880	5379080	child who is far too young to make such a decision for themselves.
5379080	5385880	I don't know. Sometimes I seriously lose faith that trans people will ever be accepted into society and
5385880	5393720	integrated into society when just the insanity that comes out of the community is so constant.
5393720	5396840	I don't know. I just feel like we never have anything positive coming out of the community. I feel like it's
5396840	5401480	always, if you don't date me, you're transphobic. Yes, seven-year-olds can decide to transition.
5401480	5405320	Yes, male athletes who popped two estrogen pills should be able to compete against women and demolish
5405320	5413000	them. Like, when, like, when is the community going to step up and realize things are going too far
5413000	5417960	and regain some credibility here? Because it's not looking good. It really isn't. Honestly, the
5417960	5422280	biggest thing for me, this is a kind of different rant, the biggest thing for me is that the trans
5422280	5426600	community seems to have no self-awareness of how they're viewed by the outside world. They
5426600	5431240	literally have no clue. A lot of these people are so caught up in their own sort of discourse and
5431240	5437800	people who agree with them that they don't realize how insane it sounds that a seven-year-old is
5437800	5442600	having his gender changed legally, is going to appointments for puberty blockers, and they just
5442600	5449080	think it's so bewildering that anyone could possibly conceivably think, should we slow down
5449080	5455480	just a little bit? No, transphobe. Like, it's just disgusting. But here, Blair was engendering much
5455480	5460360	more trouble than any of the people that she seems so concerned about. I'll say this, you know, in the
5460360	5466360	off chance that the mother of James is viewing this video, I don't want to come across as I am
5466360	5472280	attacking you. In fact, I would like to publicly reach out via this video if you watch it and say,
5472280	5476840	let's have a conversation. I would love to talk to you. I am not some random internet troll,
5476840	5482040	I'm not some anonymous person on Twitter, I'm not some hater. I'm a trans woman myself, and if
5482040	5487000	anything, I've walked this path that your son and yourself may seem to think is the right path for
5487000	5491880	him, and I'm actually willing to talk to both of you. But it's okay, I guess. At least she's willing
5491880	5495640	to have a discussion. Well, Blair, let's talk about it.
5495640	5508760	You know, it's so sad, but I hope to God that James
5509720	5515400	lucks out in the sense that he grows up and truly is trans and also doesn't want a family,
5515400	5520200	because those are the only two circumstances that would validate the choices being made for him
5520200	5525000	right now, is if he both is really trans, to which he won't regret the medications,
5525560	5530440	and that he doesn't want kids, because it already seems to be decided up for him right now,
5531000	5536520	that that's the case. Before it was circulated by a load of conservative outlets, creators,
5536520	5540920	and even some on the liberal end of the spectrum, this whole story was pretty comprehensively
5540920	5545320	investigated by a creator called Timber on Toast, who quashes most of the narratives put forward by
5545320	5549160	those in favour of the father. You should go and watch that one after this, but he shows that the
5549160	5553880	dad in this instance is by no means a helpless passenger losing his son, but someone who
5553880	5558760	instigated a lot of trouble which was practically rebuked by every medical professional who supported
5558760	5563960	the contrary perspective. Dr. Johnson receives a letter from the child's father, in which he makes
5563960	5569800	allegations about the child's mother. This letter is ignored by Dr. Johnson, who sees the child
5569800	5575480	and diagnoses them with gender identity disorder. Following the diagnosis, the medical centre tries
5575480	5580280	to contact the father to keep him involved in the process. He delays scheduling an interview
5580280	5586200	with them, saying that he is gathering information he wants to present to the head doctor. The records
5586200	5591080	show that he never followed up on scheduling that interview. The therapist confirms the diagnosis of
5591080	5595720	gender dysphoria which was made by Dr. Johnson, and advises the mother that it would be better
5595720	5600600	for the child's psychological well-being to socially affirm them as Luna, which is a girl's
5600600	5606200	name that the child has chosen for themself. The therapist advises scheduling another appointment
5606200	5611800	when the child is eight or nine to discuss whether or not hormone blockers are an appropriate measure
5611800	5618040	to take. By this time, it transpires that the child's father has contacted Dr. Johnson,
5618040	5623960	Child Protective Services, Genesis Clinic and the follow-up psychologist, making allegations to all
5623960	5628760	of them that the mother is abusing the child. He states that he suspects the mother is suffering
5628760	5634200	from Munchausen by proxy, the very same mental illness proposed by Dr. Michelle Critella,
5634200	5639800	the lady quoted in all those articles I read about this case. None of the professionals who receive
5639800	5644760	the father's letters find his allegations to be credible. This information can also be found in
5644760	5648920	court documents published around that time if you're fun enough to read them, and I'm not saying
5648920	5653320	this necessarily makes the mother a saint or that this whole hubbub even has a bearing on the
5653320	5657480	child's identity, which has now probably been completely disrupted by political figures sticking
5657480	5661080	their nose in far too deep to a case they have no knowledge of, and interfering with a court
5661080	5665880	case which has been deliberated and heard out by a jury. However, once again, a preconceived narrative
5665880	5669880	was pushed as truth without question. I mean, hell, the governor of Texas basically complained
5669880	5672600	that his own judicial system wasn't working well enough.
5672600	5676840	I love you. Please leave a comment. I want to know everyone's thoughts. Please share this video as
5676840	5680920	well. I feel like this is extremely important. Blair was a part of that, and she, of course,
5680920	5684840	doesn't have the mainstream draw of any of the figures who took to Twitter to make known their
5684840	5689160	outrage, but it was once more wrapped in those points of view that tried to make her look like
5689160	5694120	this disillusioned observer and frustrated moderate that was becoming more and more tiresome
5694120	5697880	by the upload. And honestly, even wearing what they want, if I'm being completely honest, I don't
5697880	5701960	have an issue with that at all. But the mother has been going to consultations for puberty bloggers,
5701960	5706600	is quote, not ruling it out. And it seems like this boy's fate is already decided. You know,
5706600	5710920	I do believe seven year olds can experience gender dysphoria. I was one of them, but no
5710920	5716760	seven year old is prepared mentally, emotionally, anything to make the decision to go on puberty
5716760	5721160	blockers and then hormones and then live as a woman at seven. You also see in the court notes
5721160	5726840	that there is no concrete plan for the child to go on hormone blockers. The child is six years old.
5726840	5730920	It's stated that when they are eight or nine, they will have another consultation where they
5730920	5735480	will seek advice on whether or not hormone blockers are the correct course of action.
5735480	5738680	Back when she was edgier than this and controversial, you could at least say it
5738680	5742440	was pretty clear where she would stand. But here it just felt like a bit of a ruse.
5742440	5746200	Blair constructs a fair few of her videos like this, especially when they're short and quite
5746200	5750600	loosely formulated. She starts with a root situation and branches off with a variety of
5750600	5755240	observations and opinions. You can deal with a few of those branches being off, a few points that
5755240	5759480	don't quite hit. However, if the whole root discussion is off, then the video is basically
5759480	5763960	nullified. Most people, left or right wing, wouldn't advocate for young children undergoing
5763960	5768120	hormone therapy because, like Blair said, there can be serious consequences for a decision
5768120	5773240	undertaken at such a young age when one still has a very uncertain grasp of their identity.
5773240	5777960	However, because the mother wasn't actually advocating that, Blair's secondary points here
5777960	5782760	don't feel authentic. It often feels like Blair shapes the evidence to fit the narrative rather
5782760	5787640	than vice versa, which is risky business with such a high stakes case. And she wasn't the only person
5787640	5791560	who did it here. I will make that clear. But there's a point where if you use your identity
5791560	5795720	as a badge of credibility, you need to certify it by proving you're better than those who are
5795720	5800760	pushing identical points of view. Otherwise, that additional experience means very little.
5800760	5804760	Now I'm transgender and I have feelings of gender dysphoria at that age as well.
5804760	5810120	But one thing was that I felt like a girl at that age, but it wasn't because anyone was telling me.
5810840	5814440	It wasn't because anyone was putting anything on me. It was actually the opposite.
5814440	5818440	It was the entire world, including my parents telling me, you're a boy, you're a boy, you're a boy,
5819080	5824920	and me still feeling that way. So it was not based on what my parents were instructing me on.
5825000	5827960	So that's incredibly worrisome in my opinion.
5827960	5831960	I think the problem is perfectly embodied in a situation like this, when you have a common
5831960	5835640	sense position. Many viewers, regardless of political background, will be in unison that
5835640	5840360	a mother should not force a child to transition against their will. But Blair utilizes the case
5840360	5844920	and pushes the narrative of the dangers that transgender extremities within the ideology
5844920	5849080	will produce. Blair's assertions appeal to mainstream audiences because the positions
5849080	5853160	they're rooted in are moderate by nature. That's the catch. But she's validating this
5853160	5857640	stance through a manufactured scenario. Sometimes she picked up the narrative from secondary
5857640	5862280	sources such as the I'm a predator, but it's okay because I'm trans, where she once again echoes
5862280	5865960	many claims that this individual received early release from prison because of their gender
5865960	5870200	identity, which was later contested. I'm going to read this headline to you. Convicted Pedo
5870200	5874600	to be released from jail after becoming a woman, no longer deemed a threat.
5877400	5881400	We need to dissect this. So that person was sent to prison and is now being released.
5882120	5888200	Get this, because they are identifying and transitioning into a woman. Literally because,
5888200	5892600	and I thought that can't be the reason there has to be maybe like, I don't know, good behavior or
5892600	5898280	an exoneration. No, this person still did what they did, but is getting released because they're
5898280	5903400	on hormones and according to the judge, no longer deemed a threat. So apparently the recommendation
5903400	5909560	for Josie to be released was based on the fact that Josie is on hormones, estrogen, and apparently
5909560	5915400	now doesn't have a high sex drive, and so they think it's a low risk future offender and that
5915400	5919480	they're confident Josie is not going to offend in the future. Side note, I love how she states that
5919480	5924200	parole isn't about the risk of reoffending 30 seconds after lamenting that this individual
5924200	5929320	wasn't released for good behavior, which of course has nothing to do with the risk of reoffending.
5929320	5933800	It's the same routine, moderate position. No one's going to agree that a person's sentence should be
5933800	5938120	shortened just because of their gender identity, but on further investigation that appears to not
5938120	5943080	be the case. However, it's that P word again that seems to not make a lot of people think twice.
5943080	5947480	I'll defend Blair on the front that a lot of the facts were only easily accessible after she had
5947480	5952600	released the video. However, the same can't be said for exposing games to a transgender person video,
5952600	5956200	which includes her own interpretation of personally collated research.
5956360	5961800	Tiffany proclaimed on her social media that her child now, go figure, is trans, specifically
5961800	5968840	non-binary, refers to them as a gentle them, which is so, like, that makes me want to do something
5968840	5973320	very permanent to myself that I won't say because I'll get demonetized. There's photos of Tiffany
5973320	5977480	painting the nails of this small child, which on its face is not bad. I don't think anything is
5977480	5982360	wrong with pigment on someone's nails, boys or girls, but when you couple it with now trying to
5982360	5986680	convince your child that they are also trans, that's an issue for me. People also message me
5986680	5991480	with concerns over photos with Tiffany and Tiffany's boyfriend, someone out there for
5991480	5998120	everyone apparently, wearing fetish collars around the sun, posting really weird photos of the sun
5999080	6006760	laying in his crotch while he's wearing women's panties. Yeah, so all of that's really concerning
6006760	6013720	as well as a bunch of photos of Tiffany seemingly posing very seductively in bed with the kid and,
6014280	6019880	like, you don't want to attribute something, you know, nefarious that isn't necessarily there,
6019880	6025880	but when you couple it with all the other things and the fetish collar and the weird picture where
6025880	6030200	the kid is in between the lap and the women's panties, you know, it's just very suspect and
6030200	6033720	I'm not making any direct accusations here, but I think it's something worth looking at.
6033800	6038280	Now, there are many causes for concern when it comes to Tiffany's social media conduct and
6038280	6043240	parenting skills that I would raise, but none of these explicitly prove what's denoted in the title.
6043240	6047640	Hell, Blair's own video seems to state this, but once again, the video's presentation of the word
6047640	6053160	predator and ultimately inconclusive evidence of a person who I stress is with their child is a
6053160	6057640	massive stretch. The use of the word predator is no longer just being used to play towards that
6057640	6062600	mainstream audience. It's a word that provokes strong feelings and universal condemnation.
6062600	6066520	No one wants to defend a predator, but how low are you willing to set the bar?
6066520	6072840	And I hope to God that things are not as bad as they seem to be just based on social media,
6072840	6077240	but what we know about social media is that it's like the highlight reel of people's lives.
6077240	6082360	So a fair proportion of what Blair presents as moderate has been first distorted to appeal to
6082360	6086600	the moderate crowd, though a lot of the time it is unclear whether it has been distorted before
6086600	6091640	Blair has interpreted the content or not. Although Blair has her biases, she may just be a bit
6091640	6096040	susceptible to them. To say definitively that she's actively neglecting due diligence,
6096040	6100280	you'd need a bit more solidified evidence that she was misrepresenting the content that she
6100280	6104600	depicts on her channel, henceforth undermining so many of her precious narratives.
6104600	6107240	And that wasn't exactly there yet.
6107240	6111480	Blair- Still, one day left in 2019, and I feel like 2019 was no one's year.
6111480	6116040	I feel like no one is making it out alive this year without some sort of cancellation,
6116040	6118920	some sort of scandal, and I'm a little shocked.
6118920	6121400	But it seemed that we were about to receive it.
6131640	6135320	One of the points that many sympathetic to Blair would draw from a fair proportion of
6135320	6138840	her commentary is that even if you feel she's wrong time to time, that she was at least
6138840	6142760	consistent to her fault, and that most of these issues that we've observed are yielded in a
6142760	6147160	variety of political cliques due to a fairly basic application of confirmation bias.
6147240	6151640	Her greatest failing was parroting misinformation rather than looking it up for herself,
6151640	6156040	but this theory would be tested when a new situation arose, thanks to someone by the name of
6156040	6161240	J.K. Rowling. J.K. Rowling is a pretty famous novelist who shouldn't require much introduction,
6161240	6165480	but she is primarily known for her authorship of the Harry Potter book series, an international
6165480	6169960	best-selling saga of fantasy novels, which launched an equally successful set of films,
6169960	6174120	which has only manifested its fandom in the years following. On a more personal level,
6174120	6178200	many regard them as a pretty integral part of their childhood, and hold the works very close
6178200	6183000	to their heart. However, in recent times, some have found themselves alienated by Rowling's divisive
6183000	6187320	political nature. What sort of convictions were these? Well, you may be shocked to find
6187320	6192440	they were related to gender. Yes, despite having socially liberal views on many issues,
6192440	6197640	she began to attract disapproval from some online after expressing support for Maya Forstata,
6197640	6201880	an individual who had lost an employment tribunal after her relationship with the business was
6201880	6206680	discontinued due to statements the firm had deemed ill-suited for her position. At the time,
6206680	6210600	it was implied that she had been sacked with immediate effect, and some headlines also
6210600	6215480	understated the extent of Forstata's comments, but even with this information publicly available,
6215480	6220120	Rowling didn't back down. White was also someone who advocated for Forstata at the time,
6220120	6223800	and a few days later would make a video defending J.K. Rowling's comments.
6223800	6229000	J.K. Rowling is actually someone who has traditionally been referred to as very woke,
6229000	6233960	someone who is very much favourite by the type of people who go out and call everyone transphobic,
6233960	6239160	so I was really curious as to why everyone was saying this. And apparently, it's because of
6239160	6244680	this tweet. Stress however you please is the first line. Not seeing any issues so far,
6244680	6249560	I feel like that is very agreeable. Who disagrees with that? I don't really know.
6251560	6258040	Call yourself whatever you like. Okay. We're choosing our names out here. Love it.
6258040	6261800	Now, as noted, there wouldn't necessarily be a huge issue with Rowling's tweet if its
6261800	6265800	presupposition was correct. Most people took issue with the fact that she backed someone
6265800	6270200	who many found held unsavoury ideas that were unbefitting for a position, and the fact that
6270200	6274680	the inference followed that certain gender identities were merely about how one dresses.
6274680	6278760	Now, one thing that I will say is that there was a lot of misinformation on both sides that
6278760	6284120	muddied the waters unnecessarily. However, the hearing in question did not rule against Forstata
6284120	6288520	on the basis that she believed sex wasn't real, more on the fact that she was judged as believing
6288520	6293000	that trans women were not women, and pronouns aside, she would not refer to them as such,
6293000	6297640	even if they were recognised otherwise officially, and that her take on the matter was deemed
6297640	6302840	absolutist, henceforth possibly yielding behaviour that could be seen as hostile to the work
6302840	6306680	environment. Meyer's beliefs were repeated throughout the trial, even when explaining
6306680	6311160	her misgendering of a non-binary person continuing to misgender them, I'll add.
6311160	6316440	Something else which Blair harves on, in fact, managing to misgender this person as well.
6316440	6320520	BLAIR Now, it's going around that Maya actually was on Twitter and misgendered a trans woman,
6320520	6324600	and I'm going to put that trans woman up on the screen, and I want you guys to tell me
6324600	6328680	what pronoun you would probably naturally use for this individual. Right?
6331080	6335320	With all this said, you can still disagree with the ruling and think that she should be free to
6335320	6340520	express those opinions on her social media without fear of reprimand. The judge does acknowledge that
6340520	6344360	there are shades of grey in this case, and I think they can be observed when reading the court
6344360	6349720	document. In fairness to Blair, she recognises this, is critical towards Forstater, and expresses
6349720	6354200	her opinion of the information available to her. BLAIR But I also will say it's my opinion that
6354200	6359000	these are not beliefs that I think should warrant someone being fired for their job. I understand
6359000	6363160	it's a private company, and they can decide who has the values that align with themselves,
6363160	6368280	and that's totally fine. I respect that, right? I respect the companies, right? 100%. But two things
6368280	6373560	can be true at once. You can respect the company's right to hire and fire as they see fit, and also
6373560	6377640	think it's kind of a lame reason for firing her, in my opinion. I personally don't think the jury
6377640	6381160	is out on a lot of these issues that we're debating and talking about, and so I feel like
6381160	6384840	we should be allowed to have them without fear of risking of losing our jobs.
6384840	6389160	At this time, she also takes a moment to affirm her stance on JK Rowling.
6389160	6393880	I do not think JK Rowling is transphobic. I think she's probably someone who is paying attention to
6393880	6398760	this culture war happening on gender, and if we're just basing off of her tweet, I don't see
6398760	6403560	anything transphobic in her tweet. That was a big reason, her simply stating that biological sex is
6403560	6409960	real, and if we're getting to a point where we can't say that, girl.
6409960	6415000	And to be honest, maybe Rowling was misinformed, but that doesn't prove that she was outly transphobic,
6415000	6420760	so Blair concluding on this point was a safe bet, especially for her audience. However, as always,
6420840	6425720	Blair set a benchmark for her opinion, and that meant she was going to defend it pretty staunchly.
6425720	6430840	However, this would be tested as Rowling's fiascos escalated. Essays were published, tweets were
6430840	6435080	posted, heated interactions were shared, some of which certainly seemed questionable on the
6435080	6439480	writer's front. However, Blair maintained her stance, framing the author's outlook as mostly
6439480	6444360	misunderstood by those who want to simplify it to one that could easily be classified as bigoted,
6444360	6447240	without the nuance or respect it deserved.
6447240	6450600	Conservative and liberal, the world is definitely right now divided into people
6450600	6454760	who can have a meaningful nuanced conversation about sensitive issues,
6455400	6460520	and people who can't. That's it. That's the division I see these days. The conversation
6460520	6464920	gets very muddy because people who are on the outside looking in at this whole fiasco happening,
6464920	6469240	they really do think trans people are turning on JK Rowling and don't like JK Rowling anymore
6469240	6474200	because they think JK Rowling is transphobic. But I want you guys, the next time you hear someone
6474200	6479800	talking about how transphobic someone is, please pay attention to who is saying it. I think I know
6479800	6485080	what transphobia looks like, and try as I might, and as many people are in my ear trying to tell
6485080	6490120	me that JK Rowling was transphobic in these tweets, I'm not seeing it as a trans woman,
6490120	6494120	and that's my genuine opinion. However, Blair's commitment to this standpoint would be tried
6494120	6498360	once more when Rowling released a crime novel, directly spawning further allegations of
6498360	6502680	transphobia due to its portrayal of a character who doesn't conform to traditional gender roles
6502680	6508440	as a sadistic predator. This was the rallying cry for Blair to drop her hot take, so in typical form,
6508440	6513240	she uploaded a video declaring she'd read the book, and that people were once more overreacting
6513240	6517480	to a simple detail. How could we doubt such an informed observer?
6517480	6521800	This time, everyone is up in arms about her new book being released called Trouble to Blood, and
6521800	6528760	just a heads up, I read the book. The concept of being a transvestite makes a very quick, brief,
6528760	6535240	fleeting appearance in the book, and it's extremely unimportant. It comes in the form of one line in
6535240	6542200	the book, one page in a 900 page book, and it's where the killer is described in one of the
6542200	6548120	instances of him snatching a woman up as wearing a disguise of a wig and a woman's coat. That's it.
6548120	6554280	I'm not kidding, that's it. That is everything to do that you could even remotely, if you really
6554280	6559080	stretched your mind, sort of bring that to the idea of transgenderism.
6559800	6564360	Well, the first red flags come when you realise she is wrong. In fact, there are multiple pages that could
6564360	6569640	be deemed troublesome in their content. But okay, maybe Blair just missed other references. We all
6569640	6574200	know she's not the most meticulous sometimes. Well, this becomes even more concerning when you
6574200	6579480	realise that she was not even the first person to make this specific error. In fact, this incorrect
6579480	6584600	assertion had been published in a spectator article a few days prior, and also spoken about on
6584600	6585720	public interviews.
6585720	6590120	I want to read this excerpt from a review on the spectator that I completely agree with. Let me put
6590120	6595720	it like this. When you reach the last pages, the full absurdity of the statement that Rowling's
6595720	6599240	moral seems to be, never trust a man in a dress, will be revealed.
6599240	6604440	Just going back to the book itself, from what I understand, it's simply just one line, and it's
6604440	6609880	not even necessarily referring to the killer as a transvestite. I think it just mentions that the
6609880	6615560	killer at one point wore a wig and a woman's coat, so that there is no trans rhetoric coming out of
6615560	6621160	this book at all. Then you combine this with the fact that she claimed to have read a 900 page book
6621160	6626360	in the space of 12 hours, which although not impossible, seems even less likely to be the truth
6626360	6630520	with the additional information available. It's like when two people sitting next to each other
6630600	6634760	make the exact same mistake in a test, you kinda know that one of them is cheating.
6634760	6638520	Because coming from the perspective of someone who did read this book in the last 24 hours,
6639400	6645000	there's no honest, genuine way you can link the two. I mean honestly, anyone coming to the conclusion
6645000	6648840	that this somehow demonises transgender people is either lying or has not read the book,
6649960	6651720	or is really really nutty.
6651720	6655560	Some may have admired Blair's readiness to defend Rowling against the quote,
6655560	6660280	woke brigade, but if she was prepared to falsely claim she had conducted research that she actually
6660280	6664920	hadn't with the intent to bestow herself with extra credibility, how trustworthy
6664920	6669880	was she as a source and as a creator, and how many were beginning to take notice.
6674760	6678360	While I do believe that her book is extremely problematic, and before you can comment like,
6678360	6683160	did you even read it? Yes, I read the book. At least I read the first 10 chapters that were free.
6683160	6687160	I was not about to pay this woman for her book. And honestly, the first 10 chapters are all you
6687160	6692280	need to read to like, determine that one, Blair's a liar, and two, JK Rowling is a little like...
6692280	6696200	Most of the excerpts I've referenced in the previous part were derived from a video by
6696200	6700520	trans YouTuber Samantha Lux, who made a video responding to Blair, not just correcting the
6700520	6704680	misinformation in her video, but also responding to a lot of the ensuing arguments that Blair
6704680	6708680	had averted. Blair demanded in her video that she is not a cross trans woman, she's not a
6708680	6713720	transvestite, so to say that characters like Buffalo Bill, or to say characters like Dennis
6713720	6721480	Creed have any impact on her would be offensive. Girl. Girl. It is not only incorrect to say that,
6721480	6725960	but it's wildly irresponsible. I'm not claiming that these movies, or even JK Rowling's new book,
6725960	6729960	should be trashed, or that you can't watch them, or enjoy them. All I'm trying to say is that we
6729960	6735560	need to be aware of the ways that representation of identities in media affect our perception of
6735560	6740360	those identities. It's a pretty solid response, and it certainly brought some previously wandering
6740360	6744600	eyes firmly onto Miss White's questionable groundwork and retitude. There have been doubts
6744600	6748520	earlier on in the year related to her coverage of Darby Vanity, where she appeared to use the
6748520	6752440	source material of another creator known as Temimi, while contorting the perspective to
6752440	6754600	protect the infamous Jeffree Star.
6754600	6759640	TEMIMI Blair White, the person who has gained over 500,000 subscribers for doing this,
6759640	6764360	omitted information in her video, and then lied about it. Oh, right, that's because she used some
6764360	6768840	of my clips in her video, and I could tell this specifically from the music I've used,
6768840	6775080	and also from the pictures that I personally edited out, so that way my video wouldn't get
6775080	6781080	buried in the algorithm. But in the first, like, 60 seconds I want to say of my Darby Vanity video,
6781080	6788040	I put up screenshots where Jeffree Star says these tweets, and then I emphasize the date on it,
6788040	6792840	and then right after there's another clip of him talking about going on tours, and doing all this
6792840	6797080	stuff with Darby, and supporting him again, and making a song, and then boom there's a date on it
6797080	6802600	again. And Blair White had the audacity to omit that information, she clipped it out,
6802600	6807720	and made it seem like, wow, Jeffree Star is this hero for saying something about Darby Vanity,
6807720	6811480	and never mentioned the fact that he had retracted his statements.
6827160	6830440	You know, Jeffree worked with him, and then tweeted that, and then it was over.
6830440	6837240	What do you mean you didn't have all of the facts? They were right there, 20 seconds into the video
6837240	6842920	of mine that you downloaded for your video! That's a lie, Blair!
6842920	6847320	At the time, however, in spite of the pretty irrefutable evidence contributing to this pattern,
6847320	6852040	this didn't seem to affect her reputation too much, partly because the original video included this
6852040	6856920	as a chapter, rather than as a dedicated subject, and although a more popular video was also posted
6856920	6860840	on the subject, some people struggled to follow it without the background information.
6860840	6864600	Combine this with the fact that this was still a footnote in Blair's greater video, and she was
6864600	6869400	exposing someone rather reprehensible nonetheless, and most people appeared to let it slide.
6869400	6873960	She would also appear to go against Jeffree Star in a later video, though some found it slightly
6873960	6878920	convenient. It covers James Charles and another unnamed YouTuber, and it's a very uneasy upload,
6878920	6883800	to say the least, with Blair mostly rambling, once again feeling like she was attempting to find a
6883800	6889480	reason to publish a video with a snappy title, but ultimately culminating to very little.
6889480	6892920	BLAIR What? You know what I'm saying? Like, if this is my first interaction with you,
6892920	6897400	and you feel comfortable to tell me this, thinking that I'm just going to be in on this little game
6897400	6902760	and complicit, and hee hee hee, no! That's something serious! And yes, it did take me a
6902760	6907560	month to do this video, but that's because I have been scared! This is something serious!
6907560	6911960	And I want to be very clear, this is not my place to out this person, you know, the victim's name,
6911960	6917080	because this is clearly their story to tell, but you guys have to understand the position I'm in.
6917080	6923720	If I receive credible information that a very famous, very powerful YouTuber is a sexual
6923720	6932680	molecular or predator, but am I complicit with helping cover up for a predator by not saying
6932680	6937000	that at least that much is true? I have to say, I do find the tone of the video rather confusing,
6937000	6941320	because although I think it's fair to call Jeffree out for his pathetic behavior, I was confused as
6941320	6946280	to what trap Blair was breaking out of exactly by going public with this information after it was
6946280	6951960	already public, but I digress. What matters is that the JK Rowling video attracted attention towards
6951960	6956360	Blair's potential missteps, though once again, I think people were more focused on the present,
6956360	6961640	and it would likely phase out as it normally does, provided she didn't exacerbate the situation with
6961640	6966680	greater blunders, but Blair's errors were always pretty scattershot in their occurrence, so what
6966680	6971240	were the chances that would happen? Well, maybe she tempted fate one too many times.
6971240	6974920	And with that in mind, let's talk about trans athletes.
6974920	6979240	And there are plenty of female athletes that could absolutely wipe the floor with me.
6979240	6984200	Female athletes in the comments, just comment what sport you want to beat me in, because you can do it.
6984200	6985480	Any of them. Pick one.
6985480	6990760	Transgender athletes is another subject of interest on the Blair White Network, and it's not hard to see
6990760	6995880	why, as it, like many other channel favorites, it pertains to gender identity, and how it interacts
6995880	7000200	with other social variables. It has similarly been the center of heated debate for a few years,
7000200	7004920	given the often-gendered nature of sports, and questions surrounding the suitability of individuals
7004920	7009640	whose gender identity some feel could give them an unfair physical advantage against cisgender
7009640	7013320	athletes. With this in mind, you can probably take a guess where Blair stands.
7013320	7018600	Blair White's sports teams are segregated for biological reasons, therefore, even for trans people,
7018600	7023480	you have to take biology into account, and it should not just be based on identity, it should
7023480	7028040	be based on their bodies, and their puberty they went through, how early did they transition,
7028040	7030920	how late did they transition. I think all of that matters.
7030920	7036360	Well, little surprise there, but up until September of 2020, she hadn't really been caught up in too
7036360	7040760	much controversy, mostly holding her own within the discourse on the affair, partly accountable to
7040760	7045000	the fact that there is still some ambiguity within the public sphere, even on the more liberal side
7045000	7049160	of the political spectrum. Therefore, it must have seemed like a routine upload when she decided to
7049160	7055080	criticise a transgender powerlifter for competing against women, despite the visible bodily superiority.
7055080	7065160	The bigger point is, the idea, the concept of Janae competing against biological women is ludicrous,
7065160	7069800	it's almost intentionally ignorant, and anyone who thinks that that is some sort of level playing field
7070600	7079080	is a liar. I mean, the audacity of anyone to pretend or insist that there are no very obvious
7079320	7084840	benefits that Janae as someone who developed completely male well into her adulthood would enjoy
7084840	7089000	when competing against people who did not develop male is insanity.
7089000	7092920	She metaphorically tackles the person at the crux of this curious case,
7092920	7097640	Janae Marie Kroc, and moves on. However, there was one little hitch.
7097640	7102360	And something we don't often see is that Janae actually went back post-transition and competed
7102360	7109320	against men just because I guess like it was kind of like she's gone back and forth competing with
7109320	7115560	men and women based on I don't know what. I mean, that's just a move. No pun intended.
7119000	7124200	This was all fundamentally untrue. Yes, Kroc had long made the commitment to not compete against
7124200	7129400	women. But okay, Blair made a false assumption. This isn't new territory. Well, you see, the
7129400	7133720	information that Kroc would not be competing against women under any circumstances was
7133720	7138280	actually written in one of the posts that Blair references. In fact, it's in the post that Blair
7138280	7142680	uses to push her point Janae Marie Kroc is competing against women. Up until that point in
7142680	7146760	the video, although it had been implied, she'd mostly spoken about Kroc's involvement in women's
7146760	7151320	competitions, as if it was a hypothetical. With this post, she solidified that assumption,
7151320	7155640	when really, reading that post should have debunked it. Not soon after the upload, Kroc
7155640	7159560	posts a comment on the video and a separate Instagram statement expressing her dismay at
7159560	7164120	the misinformation being disseminated, and the consequences it could have. This was also picked
7164120	7168440	up pretty quickly by a fair few online, with creator Sam Collins uploading a response to Blair
7168440	7173800	around a week after, primarily covering this mishap alongside other prior incidents. In spite of this
7173800	7178200	criticism, though, Blair did not respond. This was not out of the ordinary for her, she was used to
7178200	7183160	being castigated by communities. This time, though, the outrage didn't subside. In fact, as she
7183160	7187400	appeared to provide people with radio silence, their annoyance only grew, demanding more
7187400	7192360	accountability from someone of her size. As the videos and comments piled up, it became clear that
7192360	7197080	this was something that had to be addressed, and in mid-October, two to three weeks after Janae's
7197080	7201720	initial comment, the video was finally removed. At this point, though, a mere attraction wouldn't
7201720	7206120	suffice for many viewers. She had already caused excessive harm, and that needed to be rectified,
7206120	7210760	not just for her sake, but for the sake of the affected party. At the same time, as some began
7210760	7214840	to take note of her other transgressions that had previously flown under the radar, the backlash
7214840	7220280	began to augment in new ways, and some began to wonder how much Blair had to apologise for.
7220280	7225560	Janae's Mom- So I want to be as clear and upfront in this video as I humanly can be, because I have
7225560	7229720	essentially disabled myself from being as clear and upfront as I need to be.
7229720	7231720	Well, we were about to find out.
7241720	7247000	Blair released two apologies, a text version and a video copy, the text version coming on the 15th
7247000	7251480	of October, and the upload coming approximately a fortnight later. I assume this was because some
7251480	7255320	had felt the Twitter format was not extensive enough in the audience that it would reach,
7255320	7259160	because as themes go, neither diverge too much from the counterpart's core message.
7259160	7263560	She made a mistake, a fundamental shortcoming in research, she never published it with the intent
7263560	7267880	of deceiving anyone, and that since she had become conscious to these failings, and now has been
7267880	7272120	taking the steps to resolve the situation with Janae, transferring the AdSense money she had made
7272120	7276680	from the video after it had been deleted. With that said, there are a couple curious observations
7276680	7281800	that one can make on closer analysis. I've always found the, unlike many trans athletes, a rather
7281800	7286120	strange comment. I'm not entirely sure what the intention of that interjection was, whether it was
7286120	7290840	to shoehorn in a political point, or to try and make sense of her misguided assumption. Regardless,
7290840	7295960	there's no way Blair would know how many trans athletes compete against cis-athletes, or if it's a
7295960	7301000	majority, but anyhow, the main issue is actually buying her response that she could have sincerely
7301000	7306520	missed this information when it was readily available to her, but she at least admitted it was sloppy.
7306520	7311080	In the text post, she announced the hiatus, which is formally concluded with her video, so she had
7311080	7315800	clearly taken a bit of time to refine her thoughts, and provide her viewers with a more lucid reflection
7315800	7317080	in certain aspects.
7345960	7350440	I actually want to as well, so I'm here to do that. Two weeks ago, I posted a public apology
7350440	7355400	to someone that I highlighted in a recent video of mine, which is now taken down. It was a video
7355400	7359880	on trans athletes. In this video, I highlighted a couple different trans athletes, and I talked
7359880	7365720	about upcoming legislature that's like relevant to the topic, but long story short, one of the
7365720	7373240	trans athletes named Janae, I really fumbled her story. I got her all wrong. It is for no other
7373240	7378440	reason than my own lack of due diligence and my own lack of sufficient research on her story
7378440	7383480	that I said that. I genuinely did think it did not come from a deceptive place. I was under the
7383480	7387640	misconception that she competes in both men and women's leagues. She corrected it and said,
7387640	7393560	actually, just men's leagues, and to be frank, there is just no excuse for that kind of
7393560	7399400	inaccuracy to be present in any of my videos, and I definitely never want it to happen again.
7399480	7404200	I took the video down, and I also, once I got paid from YouTube just a couple days ago, I actually
7404200	7409480	sent her the totality of the AdSense revenue that I accrued from that video.
7409480	7414280	She also explains her delayed response, yielding from her reputation as a bit of a renegade to
7414280	7419000	many who chastised her, and how it influenced her perception of the criticism that she was receiving.
7419000	7424280	Also, I know that some people are critical of the delayed response I had when I apologized to Janae,
7424280	7428840	and for that, I also have to say I'm sorry. I think the unfortunate thing is it took me
7428840	7433720	a lot longer than it should have to differentiate between valid criticism and hate, and it wasn't
7433720	7437080	the right thing to do, but I think that for a minute there, I had my blinders on because
7437080	7442040	I'm so used to sort of, you know, I do controversial topics on every video,
7442040	7446040	so there's always people mad, and I think to a certain extent, I was almost just in this rhythm
7446040	7449560	where, like, post a video, people are mad. Post a video, people are mad, but this time,
7450280	7455400	obviously, people were mad for a valid reason, and it was always valid, and I should have
7455400	7459640	recognized it. However, her reflection appeared to have obscured her memory on other fronts,
7459640	7463000	as her JK Rowling ebook had now become a physical copy.
7463000	7470200	Being a long, obnoxiously fake novel of JK Rowling's for research to doing such incredibly
7470200	7474600	subpar research on the second video, but I did, and it was dumb, and I am sorry.
7474600	7478360	It was slightly ironic that this statement followed after a persistent contention that
7478360	7482680	she would not lie intentionally, but I understand why she used this as an example to try and
7482680	7486600	emphasize that this was an exception rather than a chronic issue with her content.
7486600	7490920	But here's the problem, it does seem to be a chronic issue, and it couldn't be stressed
7490920	7492520	more than in this scenario.
7492520	7499320	It's just a learning opportunity to implement that in every area of my life, here and in my real life.
7499320	7503160	I'm not infallible, I'm most definitely susceptible to getting things wrong,
7503160	7508200	and it's really how you respond to it once you do get it wrong that makes all the difference,
7508200	7509480	and I totally get that.
7509480	7514120	In the context of the video it's presented in, it's a reasonable response, we've all made mistakes,
7514120	7518040	we've all made videos we regret in hindsight, content that we would have done differently,
7518040	7522040	and for anyone to act holier than thou in such a situation is hardly justified.
7522040	7526520	Unfortunately, with the information available on her previous actions that she had simply not addressed
7526520	7531400	in the past, it became increasingly hard to fully trust her account, especially with the JK Rowling gaffe
7531400	7535800	in mind. It would be easy to read this as her only choosing to respond when she actually faced
7536040	7540520	consequences for her inaccuracies. She had lost over 20,000 subscribers by this point,
7540520	7545400	and although such a sign may make you more conscious, many more cynical views felt like her hand had been
7545400	7550280	forced to save her skin. At the time though, many were simply not aware of this, and welcomed her apology
7550280	7556120	with open arms. She didn't necessarily need to make a video statement, so what she provided was a solid step up,
7556120	7561640	however not too long after the tides once more began to turn, as the content of those critical of her
7561640	7567160	work began to accumulate. However, the fatal blow could be attributed to someone by the name of D'Angelo Wallace.
7567160	7571320	The JK Rowling book? How did she say she got it?
7571320	7574760	Overnight shipping, a long, obnoxiously thick novel.
7574760	7578760	Overnight shipping? But I thought she said in her book review that...
7578760	7581800	I spent the last 12 hours reading it as an e-book.
7584920	7585960	So she didn't read it.
7585960	7590520	D'Angelo Wallace had been mostly known for making videos on subjects primarily involved in more tabloid
7590520	7595000	drama up to this point, pretty comprehensively, I'll add, though I'm not going to stroke his ego too much,
7595000	7598200	as he's probably watching this video right now, so he knows what he does.
7598200	7603080	His video on Blair White served in part as a documenting of this pattern of behaviour that we've discussed
7603080	7607480	throughout this episode, but also took the time to respond to her admission video, pointing out what a more
7607480	7612840	casual viewer may have missed, drawing unparalleled amounts of attention to an abundance of inconsistencies,
7612840	7617720	causing many to flood the comment section of the videos with these observations, and swing the like-dislike
7617720	7620440	ratio in a much more unfavourable direction.
7620440	7625160	Unfortunately, Blair's apology really needed to be flawless to avoid being picked apart by many of those
7625160	7630040	who had come out in force against her, and it just wasn't, it was made with a precision similar to the
7630040	7634280	videos she was being called out for in the first place, and as more turned their eye towards her,
7634280	7638280	Blair's impassioned pleas were gradually being weathered away. However, it didn't stop there,
7638280	7643080	because as D'Angelo Wallace's video came out very shortly after Blair's response, its timing meant it
7643080	7647960	served almost as a retort in itself, but Wallace nonetheless also took a great amount of time to
7647960	7650920	tell his own story. I used to be a huge Blair White fan.
7650920	7654840	I personally disagreed with her conservative opinions, but that was never what she really
7654840	7659400	centered her content around when it comes to YouTube anyway. I mean, she is a writer for this
7659400	7663640	conservative publication called The Post-Millennial, but as far as her videos go,
7663640	7668920	she mostly just provides a perspective on things that happen that's alternative to the ones people
7668920	7674280	typically run with, and I found that fascinating. What I'm trying to say here basically is I was
7674280	7679000	super transphobic when I was watching her content. I'm not saying, oh, I was raised this way or I
7679000	7685560	didn't know. I legitimately believed that trans people were irrational unless they were exactly
7685560	7691560	like Blair White, and that's insane. His upload spanning just over an hour addresses
7691560	7696040	his parasocial relationship with the creator in question and deconstructs her appeal as a
7696040	7700840	supposedly transgender spokesperson for the community, ravaging the fabric of many of her
7700840	7705400	principles and asserting that much of her content was built on belittling other trans people who
7705400	7711160	didn't match up to her standards. Or the one thing here, it's this entire pattern, and now when I
7711160	7716360	think about the fact that she's gone after somebody like Janai Marie Kroc, who absolutely
7716360	7722120	fits the description of being non-binary and says so, I'm nearly positive that Blair White has done
7722120	7727080	this on purpose, because it's what she's always done since 2016, is try to make these people look
7727080	7731240	bad so Blair can feel better. This not just shifted focus towards the inconsistencies in
7731240	7735400	Blair's content, but also towards what many found in her, particularly those who may have placed her
7735400	7740360	on a pedestal previously. Sure, she had always branded herself as problematic, but I think many
7740360	7744760	still held her in higher regard than the light that a lot of these negative videos cast her in,
7744760	7749400	even the ethos of her predator exposes were brought into contention. All of a sudden,
7749400	7753800	the significance of her apology video was dwarfed by something greater, the issue of whether her
7753800	7758280	content had been tainted by the same toxicity that had been illuminated in this debacle.
7758280	7763240	D'Angelo would argue so, but was that the entire story? Well, let's talk about it.
7779400	7797080	D'Angelo approached Blair White from the perspective of a former viewer,
7797080	7801240	and even supporter of Blair, and this created a case that was very compelling in itself.
7801240	7805880	In part two, I wanna look at Blair Wright's track record of mistakes, and what they say about the
7805880	7810440	kind of person that she is on YouTube, and I wanna do this from the perspective of a former fan.
7810440	7814360	His video walked us through the process of realization, many of which he had only come
7814360	7818840	to understand himself somewhat recently, being told with a harsh sense of self-reflection,
7818840	7823240	and consequently provoking the question for more conscientious audience members who may hold their
7823240	7827880	creators to high account. The fact that he doesn't pull any punches against his own past self means
7827880	7831880	that he does not need to compromise on his own presentation of Blair. I mentioned earlier that
7831880	7835880	I used to be a pretty big fan of Blair White, but when I stopped watching her, I didn't just
7835880	7842280	unsubscribe. I stopped and questioned myself, and had to evaluate why I was ever subscribed
7842280	7845880	in the first place. I could claim that it was just because I wanted to hear the opinions of
7845880	7850760	a trans person, but if anything has become clear by now, there are much better people on the
7850760	7854680	platform who can speak up for their trans experiences. This personal connection with
7854680	7858280	D'Angelo reached Blair White viewers who themselves were prone to disillusionment,
7858280	7862280	and as people began to experience this epiphany through the lens that Wallace presented,
7862280	7867080	some decided to make known their dissatisfaction by using the only physically tangible method they
7867080	7871320	have beyond likes and comments, taking up their qualms with the unsubscribe button.
7871320	7874840	In the comment section, beyond the many expressing shock at some of Blair's actions,
7874840	7879080	others wrote to confess that they themselves had been won over by her rhetoric without considering
7879080	7883960	it seriously. It seems that D'Angelo's message had effectively broken through, but why though?
7883960	7888120	After all, much of what she was being called out for was hardly surprising, and the catalyst
7888120	7892360	for all this hullabaloo was a research error that most would probably feel isn't worth crucifying
7892360	7895960	someone over. Hell, it wouldn't necessarily change their viewpoint as long as there were
7895960	7900920	grounds for it to still exist, which as noted, there was. And on her offensive content, well…
7901400	7906280	I know that casually saying the N-word with the hard R means you're definitely racist.
7924840	7929320	I didn't see her address those in the truth about my racist past video.
7929320	7933080	Go back a few years and you had one of the most prominent commentators on YouTube arguing that
7933080	7936760	slurs were completely acceptable, and whether you like that or not, the truth is that it's
7936760	7941320	not a deal breaker for a lot of audiences. So beyond this and D'Angelo's ability to relate
7941320	7945640	feelings and responsibility to those watching, how did this video show Blair up to the point
7945640	7948840	where she was hemorrhaging subscribers faster than she was before?
7948840	7954920	I really do feel as though this is sort of a very simple natural consequence of sort of
7954920	7959960	the entirety of the trans community, their activists and the Wokeys as we call them,
7959960	7964600	really plugging in their ears at every ounce of evidence that people are constantly trying to
7964600	7969240	give them that like, look, it's not about hating trans people. It's not about like having horrible
7969240	7975400	feelings towards them. It's literally just this isn't fair and it's obvious. Can you guys please
7975400	7979640	address this? And they just don't. Well, I think it comes back to the root theory, not just
7979640	7984280	regarding her videos, but herself as a whole. She bases a lot of her assertive persona on the
7984280	7988760	stances she takes and the fact that she has a grasp on them. She walked that balance of being
7988760	7993640	the outspoken person who isn't afraid to say it as she sees it. But if that's not how she actually
7993640	7998360	sees it, if her vision is that obfuscated, what grounds does she have to say it? How can you
7998360	8004040	justify all the jibes and snarky comments without the grounds? At that point, you risk reducing
8004040	8008280	yourself to an edgelord with no greater purpose than to stir the pot. People questioned how she
8008280	8013080	could sincerely hold the beliefs if she wouldn't properly evidence them. On a more serious note,
8013080	8016920	many felt with the misinformation that she purported, this could lead to false beliefs
8016920	8021240	being held about marginalized groups that may drive bigotry and discrimination. This also
8021240	8025320	compromises elements of her demeanor, because when you reverse the logic, you realize that
8025320	8029160	everyone she has characterized as being unreasonable activists who hated her because
8029160	8033640	she was spit in facts may have actually just been critics who were irked by the alleged mistruths
8033640	8039400	propagated in her content, and her status as this pariah becomes much more apt. The shoe is on the
8039400	8056520	other foot now. And what could Blair say to this? Well, to be honest, it was a very rough
8056520	8060680	predicament given she had already admitted to making a mistake. Creators were free to draw
8060680	8064840	their own conclusions from it if they were well evidenced. She could respond, but it would risk
8064840	8069320	prolonging the turmoil that she was already going through, and possibly inflicting more losses onto
8069320	8074120	herself. Unless she had some receipts to turn the situation on its head, it wasn't worth the hassle,
8074120	8079160	so she moved on to calling out a mossy who is completely deserving of being called out. Of course,
8079160	8083320	she had to make the point that no one else was talking about it, other than these people, of course,
8083320	8087640	but that's just the clickbait game. The video itself is fine, but with that shadow still over her,
8087640	8092680	it seemed that much of the momentum that she had was now against her, with a gross subscriber loss
8092680	8097800	of over 70,000. Some may ponder if that is truly fair on someone who hasn't done anything of the
8097800	8102440	scale and consequence of some that we have given air time on this channel before, but at that point
8102440	8107080	she had been charged with a crime of influence. In my opinion, Blair White is the most irrational
8107080	8112120	one out of them all, and it's not because she's transgender or for any reason other than the fact
8112120	8117400	that she is a liar who wants to manipulate the emotions of the whole world into becoming evidence
8117400	8121560	for something that she knows isn't true. I'm not saying she was being persecuted here for having
8121560	8126120	unbiased opinions, it was a greater point claiming that she was either being unbelievably reckless
8126120	8130680	with her platform, or that she was just an outwardly bad actor, and that convinced many
8130680	8134760	to withdraw their support. It was difficult to argue against it with the volume of evidence
8134760	8138680	available, and I think the most disheartening fact was the revelation that very little had changed
8138680	8143160	over the years which had passed, even if it was presented under a different guise. Blair had
8143160	8147800	gravitated from the outdated cliques of certain viewpoints of 2016, and the trouble they would
8147800	8151960	often instigate, which was great. However, this ultimately worked against Blair because whereas
8151960	8156440	in past situations, such as the Riley Dennis case, the behaviour could be chalked up to certain
8156440	8160840	communities and environmental factors causing her perception to be coloured, it became apparent to
8160840	8166040	many that these shenanigans transcended external variables. Even as she moved into the mainstream
8166040	8171160	eye, she perpetuated a lot of these issues. Even as some had warned her, and called her out,
8171160	8176600	she had time to fix this, and ultimately it was a Blair White problem, which is why she suffered
8176600	8182200	to the extent she did, and why videos like D'Angelo's hit as hard as they did. As a matter
8182200	8187400	of fact, many commentators had clearly cottoned onto this, because they were all choosing to come
8187400	8192600	up with their own hypotheses for what personal motives drove Blair to act in this way, latching
8192600	8197880	onto the examples of invalidation, to push another fairly common hypothesis we'd previously considered,
8197880	8200040	the good transgender person.
8200040	8204520	I cannot even tell you the thousands of emails, thousands of comments that I got from people
8204520	8209240	who had literally no understanding of trans people before that Jessica Yaneef story,
8209240	8213640	and when they saw my video calling it out, and they realized that I'm trans calling it out,
8213640	8219880	their perspective was changed 1000%. And suddenly they realized, I shouldn't have painted an entire
8219880	8224280	community with that brush, and this girl seems normal, this girl's cool, and that was what
8224280	8230120	happened. Like, no, there are normal trans people out there who don't believe all these radical things.
8231000	8235880	However, this only really addresses a personal philosophy that may drive certain aspects of her
8235880	8240760	beliefs, and risks overlooking the actual conduct that landed her in this jam in the first place.
8240760	8245640	It's a jump that ignores a few steps, and I'd like to take a moment to step over them myself,
8245640	8249960	as I do believe there was a bit of disparity in what people actually believed here.
8254280	8267960	Do not fear, we'll cross the bridge of what Blair's personal philosophy precipitates when we reach it.
8267960	8272360	Beyond the fact that it is of course just theory, whether well backed up or not, I'm sure there are a few
8272360	8277240	people who likely feel the way that Blair does, yet for some reason they haven't ended up in the public
8277240	8282520	quagmire for peddling misinformation on the internet. Blaming that solely on what Blair believes seems
8282520	8288440	somewhat insubstantial. Misinformation comes down to, more fundamentally, two explanations, negligence,
8288440	8293560	or malice, or both, maybe, who knows. Some would be inclined to say that this is a case of negligence,
8293560	8298360	that's what Blair herself said, as a matter of fact, she actually alludes to it in her video, making this
8298360	8299840	bold claim in her defence.
8304120	8309320	While I know some people think this was intentional deception on my part, I can guarantee you this is not the
8309320	8315960	case. Lying about something that the public can then go correct you on is only slightly more dumb than
8315960	8321160	not doing enough research and coming to a false conclusion, and it was a really dumb moment on my part,
8321160	8326760	and I'm not taking away from that, but I also would like it to be known that it was not malicious intent,
8326760	8329240	or something that was intentional.
8331240	8336120	Now, on paper, it's not like this doesn't hold water, it would be incredibly counterproductive for her to
8336200	8341160	intentionally spout falsified content when she was already under scrutiny. There were other examples that
8341160	8345480	would have been more appropriate, examples she had referenced in the past herself. To some, maybe Blair's
8345480	8350840	biases had finally conquered her, she went into the video with a perspective first, and didn't pay mind to any
8350840	8355320	information that would actually counter this, and could have easily prevented this faux-puck, it wouldn't have
8355320	8360760	been difficult to find a new subject and uphold her point of view, right? Well, I suppose it depends on what
8360760	8365480	point you believe she's trying to make. This is where we can reintroduce the point that many were articulating,
8365480	8369960	that she'd like to make an example out of those trans people who didn't look like her, and in many ways,
8369960	8372040	the upload in question was no exception.
8372040	8375800	Jenna- I'm not making fun of her appearance, I mean, I think that obviously her appearance is outlandish,
8375800	8381080	and I think that even she would admit that, because how could she not? But that's not the point, the bigger point is...
8381080	8385480	This was one of the comments that many harped on when criticising her, it felt like she was going after an
8385480	8390840	individual on the basis that a person did not appear as orthodox as she did, and this is what motivated her
8390840	8395400	to single out Jenna. Was this enough for her to discount information that would serve to the contrary?
8395400	8400440	Well, some would argue that as well, especially given only the video before, many believed that she had lied
8400440	8405240	about reading a book she never did, especially given it was a lie that she subsequently repeated in a video
8405240	8411000	where she expressed remorse. If lying was easy, then how could we trust her intent on any other front?
8411000	8416280	Well, the truth is that you can't, but does that definitively mean that it was an act of malice?
8416280	8421000	You see, her comments about JK Rowling's book was definitely one to bolster her credibility,
8421000	8426440	and likely views as well. It was daft, and would justifiably prompt one to question the integrity of future
8426440	8431480	comments about her tenacity. However, this is mostly a disposable comment, which although she shouldn't have
8431480	8436280	made, also wouldn't have had the greatest implications whether she had actually read the book or not.
8436280	8441400	In fact, if she had her facts straight, nobody would have any reason to disbelieve that she read the book,
8441400	8446680	even if she didn't. It's easy to make an aside comment to try and outperform fellow commentators
8446680	8450920	in the algorithm. That doesn't mean you're capable of knowingly twisting information about other people
8450920	8455880	that could, in reality, be borderline defamatory. However, you could also respond to this by saying
8455880	8460520	that Blair had been called out for this behaviour on a continuous basis. There are more than ample
8460520	8464920	warning signs that her research was not sufficient, and that she would regularly either dismiss this
8464920	8469720	criticism, or sweep it under the rug. Now, to be honest, I wouldn't necessarily expect her to address
8469720	8474840	every individual mistake, when she wasn't the only person who fell foul to fake news. However, the fact
8474840	8479480	that she clearly was aware of certain incidents and reacted to them, such as the drag queen one,
8479480	8484280	for example, should have been an indicator that she needed to tread more carefully, but it never felt
8484280	8489080	like she did, and that made it much harder to defend her. However, the question still begged,
8489080	8495000	what did Blair really have to gain from being so intentionally dishonest? Well, I guess the obvious
8495000	8499400	one would be clout from pandering to an audience's ideology. In the case of some creators, they'll
8499400	8504040	find a niche, realise they're somewhat limited in their scope, and begin twisting or stretching
8504040	8508680	stories to their audience tastes, even if that means not being completely transparent. There are
8508680	8513160	some cases where it feels like Blair did this, such as the Trump hat in Hollywood. However, by
8513160	8517800	2020, I wouldn't say that her audience had a collective credo, and she could have easily taken
8517800	8522360	a more moderate standpoint, and not been strung up. She'd done that before with the transgender
8522360	8527080	bathroom issue, and not been criticised, so it does point to something personal, and arguably
8527080	8531960	possibly the most malicious explanation. The idea that Blair was trying to indoctrinate her viewers,
8531960	8537000	using content calling out predators to advance her moral standing, and then capitalising on that with
8537000	8541560	dangerously slanted opinion pieces based off dubious sources that she knew wasn't the case.
8541560	8546360	This would indeed be a very ruinous portrait, and would certainly explain at least a fair majority
8546360	8551240	of what we've discussed. However, it is also based on assumptions whose verity we can't be certain
8551240	8556280	of. It goes on the pivotal assumption that Blair knew she was lying in each of the stories, which
8556280	8558920	although plausible, is not the sole explanation.
8564920	8569800	You can say a lot of things about me, and I know I'm messy. I'm a messy ass b****, this is nothing new,
8569800	8573560	everyone who knows me knows it, everyone who doesn't know me but hears about me knows it, it's true.
8574840	8579880	Many of Blair White's videos emanated the high school goss energy, and Blair's demeanour similarly
8579880	8584360	matched that. She never appeared to be openly vitriolic towards anyone, but she constantly
8584360	8589160	walked the line very precariously, blurring the boundaries between idle minded errors and
8589160	8594360	intentional manipulation. The failure to provide proper information and omit a lot of relevant facts
8594360	8599320	appeared to be a result of laziness of research, and the fact that she based a lot of her material
8599320	8604840	off other creators who were also heavily biased. She'd come in with her own preconceived narratives,
8604840	8609560	and not question the intent. Her controversies often showed her as being impulsive, petty,
8609560	8615080	and in a way self-interested, but not really in a particularly calculated manner. To paraphrase
8615080	8619400	Blair a bit more unflatteringly, one would expect a person to be a bit smarter if they
8619400	8623880	really wanted to take advantage of their audience in such a way. I'd say the greatest lie that Blair
8623880	8628440	has maintained is this idea that she is some high research creator who is working behind the scenes,
8628440	8633480	when really she's just a T-Youtube who talks politics. With that said, there were other situations
8633480	8637720	such as certain response videos where it became very hard to believe that she'd missed information,
8637720	8641720	or cases where it seemed she was presenting slanted points of view. The fact that she leaves
8641720	8646920	next to no references means that people can't fact check her as easily, and may make one question
8646920	8653000	why she does it. Maybe she knows her sources are a bit unreliable. More importantly though, this is
8653000	8657480	why Blair's biases have come to the forefront of her content in the first place. Otherwise,
8657480	8661880	no one would really be able to challenge her opinions too deeply, provided they felt like
8661880	8666200	they were properly derived from the actual observations that could be made. Too many times,
8666200	8670600	her opinions led the videos rather than the subjects themselves, and that was a detriment
8670600	8675000	to her and those that she spoke about. We know what these opinions are at this stage,
8675000	8679080	but what can be said beyond that? Well, let's go there now.
8683960	8688280	As said, I've never watched Blair White routinely, but I know a fair few people who have, and one of
8688280	8691880	the recurring comments that stopped them from watching her was the fact that her takes became
8691880	8695720	predictable. This is never a good trait to attribute to a creator, but I think it's worse
8695720	8699720	when you're dealing with information that is warped to suit your predictability. As the years
8699720	8704120	passed, and she became more mainstream, she may have changed, but not necessarily in a way that
8704120	8707960	rectified the previous issues that she'd been called out for. As a matter of fact,
8707960	8712760	you could harken back to one early video that clearly reflects her core views to this day.
8712760	8716840	So I think this meme pretty much sums up how I feel, but I will go into more detail.
8720440	8724440	So yeah, I think all these identities are largely bullshit. I think they're super arbitrary,
8724440	8729960	I think they're super meaningless, I think people who take them on are usually extremely boring,
8729960	8736280	and have nothing else for their personality other than I'm demi-queer, non-binary, genderfuck,
8736280	8742520	special snowflake kin. This mostly unsubstantiated idea that many of the people she railed against in
8742520	8747160	certain scenarios were concocting their gender identities for attention, and you know, on the
8747160	8752200	internet, sure, there are people who go to extreme measures in certain communities, but many of the
8752200	8756760	people she would go on to subsequently make an example of, were not people who she had any way
8756760	8761960	of backing up such a claim, other than her own prejudices. In her first ever upload, during her
8761960	8766600	brief anti-feminist phase, she talks about the differences between how men and women are treated
8766600	8771400	in society. She does reference some evidence-based arguments, but as we noted, talks about her
8771400	8772920	personal experience as well.
8773560	8778680	The term ladies first is definitely something that's actually implemented, it's not just a phrase,
8778920	8784920	and while these are sort of frivolous examples, I do think there's something worth noting about the
8784920	8791080	quality of life that women experience based on operating through a society that's just kinder to
8791080	8796920	them, that's just more polite to them, that's just more welcoming of them.
8796920	8802280	It's curious because those she has most vitriol towards, in many ways, are the people who are already
8802280	8806440	receiving a lot of stigma from the communities that surround them, and if you are to consider how
8806520	8811080	society treats you on a personal level as a form of privilege, then many of the people that blare her
8811080	8816120	ranks are some of the most alienated in society, whether that was the transgender women who struggled
8816120	8821080	to pass, or non-binary people who identify in a way that is contrary to traditional gender roles.
8821080	8826040	So to pose the question, why would these people act in ways that are attention seeking if there is so
8826040	8830920	little to prospectively gain, and who are we to say beyond a shadow of a doubt those are acting in
8830920	8835480	such a way regardless, unless there is serious evidence to prove it? The other point that Blair
8835480	8839320	would regularly advocate is the one that she doesn't want to be thrown under an umbrella with
8839320	8842920	certain individuals who may not have shared similar experiences that one would consider
8842920	8846600	inclusive of what she feels constitutes as transgender.
8846600	8851320	What really gets me about that is that there are so many different letters in the LGBT acronym at this point,
8851320	8855560	I think we all know it's basically the entire alphabet, plus some numbers, so there's all these
8855560	8860680	micro-distinctions, this is this type of person, this is this type of person, this is this type of person,
8860680	8864200	but yet for me saying, okay, I'm different than that is a problem.
8864200	8868680	She seems highly insecure about the fact that she may also have to share the spotlight with people who
8868680	8873480	haven't gone through medical procedures, which I'm sure are highly distressing experiences, and I would
8873480	8878200	never take that away from anyone. Nonetheless, anyone who's subjected to additional social stigma
8878200	8883000	for not conforming to binaries like Blair does is still another form of suffering, most people would
8883000	8887800	probably just like to live in peace away from that. When it comes to this issue, Blair says it pretty
8887800	8889160	succinctly herself.
8889320	8894760	And the goal of trans people is to operate within the binary, as in moving from one to the other.
8894760	8899720	She wants to exist within the gender binary, which is good, I'm happy for her. However, it feels like
8899720	8904600	she's driven by this slippery slope argument that the transgender community and society as a whole
8904600	8909560	will just evolve into this totalitarian civilization where everyone announces their pronouns before
8909560	8913400	they initiate a conversation, and those who don't conform will be thrown into the gulag.
8913400	8918120	An exaggeration, I'm aware, but she frames it as if many non-binary people are motivated
8918120	8923000	to deconstructing the gender binary as we know it, despite the fact that many non-binary people
8923000	8927720	also identify with traditional gender roles as well. This isn't just the case for non-binary
8927720	8931320	people though, this is the problem with Blair's rhetoric in general, and one that reared its head
8931320	8936200	again with the Janai Marie Kroc situation, that claim that some fabric of what we're used to is
8936200	8940600	going to be lost, and hey, trying to preserve tradition is in part what makes her conservative,
8940600	8945080	I understand that. However, it feels like Blair's reaching for bogeymen to raise one's level of
8945080	8949800	concern when a lot of the time, a situation is more nuanced than it appears, watering it down
8949800	8953960	with notions that she's long established but not necessarily thought to check if it's completely
8953960	8958200	relevant to the point that she's making in the first place. Hell, in a video a few uploads after
8958200	8962680	a big apology where she responds to a video with a person who identifies as a dog, she falls foul
8962680	8963840	to this once more.
8963840	8969400	The only thing I know about this before watching it is that this is a trans man who is also a trans dog.
8970120	8973400	If you think I'm saying this to make fun of this person, that is not the case, this is literally
8973400	8977480	how this person describes themselves, a trans man who also identifies as a dog.
8977480	8980040	2020, what's good? Bella, look, it's your cousin.
8982840	8987080	The issue is that this person never said they identify as a dog, and a quick watch of the full
8987080	8989640	video will show you that this is role play.
8989640	8997080	That plays anytime that a person takes on the role of an animal, and they emulate that animal,
8997080	8999640	either through their behavior or their actions.
8999640	9004200	However, it's put in the original video's title as a bit of clickbait, I suppose, and Blair just
9004200	9008840	runs with it without demonstrating any semblance of critical thinking, and playing into the biases
9008840	9011240	that she's been known to possess time and time again.
9011240	9016120	I identify as a dog thing. I identify as a man and also as a dog thing.
9016120	9020520	Like, it makes a mockery of actual trans people, and y'all don't need me to even tell you that.
9020520	9021560	Like, y'all know.
9021560	9028360	This perfectly feeds into the millions of people on social media just search up the terms I identify
9028360	9030440	as. It's like a big joke.
9030440	9031480	Like, it's a joke.
9031480	9032920	Like, I identify as a helicopter.
9032920	9035160	I identify as this phone.
9035160	9042360	I identify as this hairbrush, and it adds such an extra layer that the person is actually,
9042360	9045160	you know, a trans man, supposedly.
9045160	9047320	Like, why are you equating?
9047320	9049720	Like, why are you doing that?
9049720	9052520	You're blurring lines that I would prefer not to be blurred.
9052520	9056840	And here's the thing, with this in mind, I do think the mainstream media mishandles trans issues
9056840	9060200	in a way that may provoke some people to be defensive of their identity.
9060200	9064600	I've never liked the idea of singular spokespeople for a whole community of extremely diverse
9064600	9069000	individuals, and I do think a lot of them take advantage of the shock value that some may provoke,
9069000	9070600	but you have to see through that.
9070600	9074680	The greatest problem is that instead of merely calling out the coverage of a lot of this content
9074680	9078760	on these failings, Blair goes one step further, and in a way contradicts herself.
9078760	9082680	Now, she does call the mainstream media out sometimes, but then goes on to assume a lot of the
9082680	9087720	stories as prototypical, often using them to denigrate other trans identities, whether she
9087720	9089000	intends to or not.
9089000	9093240	However, I think once you establish the fact that a lot of the time, the media and third-party
9093240	9098200	sources can be highly unreliable narrators in representing your community, you have to consider
9098200	9102120	how they may have changed the perception of the story and where the truth actually lies.
9102120	9106360	Blair makes this argument that, to put it quaintly, feels like she's frustrated that the attention
9106360	9111000	on certain individuals begins to erase her own lived experience and warp this idea of what the
9111000	9115320	community is really like, but her response is to try and undermine these people's identities,
9115320	9119160	sometimes with the same points that are levied against her community in the first place.
9119160	9121240	It's cruel and counterproductive.
9121240	9124680	No community is going to represent identical experiences.
9124680	9128120	No group of people is even going to share all of them together.
9128120	9132840	We are different, and I don't think people in any community should need to compete for validation.
9132840	9134440	Does that mean they're the same?
9134440	9139400	Of course not, but does that mean that a person can't share a label that many believe to be
9139400	9140920	inclusive anyway?
9140920	9141480	Hell no.
9141480	9145080	I don't think Blair accomplishes anything by putting people down in such a way,
9145080	9149640	and the fact that her points aren't well grounded makes her own biases even more blatant.
9149640	9153880	Maybe there is more work to be done, but I don't think Blair ever presented a solution,
9153880	9155400	and I don't think she's changing.
9155400	9157240	But what changes should be made?
9157240	9161240	It's easy to sit here and point out the problems, but what's the solution?
9169400	9180440	At the start of the video, when I stated that I was at least surprised I found myself on this alongside Blair,
9180440	9184200	I guess the shock wasn't just because of what I knew her previously thought,
9184200	9189400	but how I recognised the best begrudged ambivalence many critics still held towards her,
9189400	9192520	how she was still disliked by a lot of people.
9192520	9196680	The issues were still prevalent, and I think it made her position more vulnerable
9196680	9200680	given the number of those who looked to her for reasons other than her politics.
9200680	9205080	I questioned a lot whether I should make this part in past or present tense,
9205080	9210440	given the fact that a lot of it is obviously retrospective, and she has definitely mitigated some of her rhetoric.
9210440	9214760	However, Blair has continued to slip up in delivering information, at the time writing,
9214760	9218120	most recently with a story about a person by the name of Barbie Kardashian,
9218120	9220280	who is worse than Jessica Yaniv.
9220280	9222520	Nice little throwback reference there.
9222600	9227320	The star of today's video is someone by the name of Barbie Kardashian.
9227320	9230520	Yes, this mugshot is real, this is not a creepypasta,
9230520	9239080	and this story is probably the most disgusting and disturbing instances of a trans person being put into a women's present,
9239080	9246760	and I say trans person in quotations, you will see why this person is basically Jessica Yaniv on steroids,
9246760	9249080	I would say on hormones, but that's not the case.
9249160	9252920	The video once again circulates information from very slanted websites,
9252920	9257640	and doesn't really address the actual situation, including this picture which lacks a source.
9257640	9261400	After some reading, I'd say the allegations against the women appear to be true,
9261400	9266040	though they're taken from a report which keeps the original individual anonymous, but it adds up.
9266040	9269720	The mugshot may be true because the Garda did release one to its officers,
9269720	9273720	however, one site just said they obtained it and no one questioned it.
9273720	9278120	However, Blair, once again bawling foul to the pseudo-common sense position,
9278120	9280680	implies that a take on this matter is the moderate one.
9280680	9286600	I think there are problems with both ends of the extreme, and so I'm gonna offer some solutions in this video that are outside of that.
9286600	9291960	I know a lot of people, maybe even that are watching this video, are more comfortable with keeping it simple in their minds,
9291960	9295720	which, you know, biological sex you're born as, that's what prison you go to,
9295720	9301000	and then other people are gonna be more on the extreme of, if this person says they're a woman, they're a woman,
9301960	9311400	but these sort of absolutist, extremist positions are what gets us into 99% of the messes we get into in all areas of when it comes to trans people.
9311400	9319400	For example, me b****, in their right mind, who would think that if, God forbid, y'all caught me flippin' and convicted me as some kind of crime,
9319400	9322440	that I would be best placed into a men's prison.
9322440	9329160	Of course, Blair, we should have an independent board which assesses when people are woman enough to be permitted to women's prisons.
9329320	9330040	Genius.
9330040	9335160	Here's the thing, and in my humble opinion, in part, a reason for why so many people in the past took to Blair,
9335160	9339720	I don't think our philosophy is one that is completely alien, particularly in 2016.
9339720	9344920	Born out of a frustration at certain institutions, individuals, and their somewhat obnoxious doctrines,
9344920	9347720	you see the antics, and it causes a gut reaction.
9347720	9353800	A lot of people felt it back then, and some still feel it today, especially when they feel like they're on the receiving end of it.
9353800	9357400	There definitely are people out there who make unreasonable demands of those around them,
9357400	9361240	some who are far too hostile and unpleasant in trying to pursue their causes,
9361240	9365480	and others who I think are too sensitive and far too overreaching in what they try to police.
9365480	9369720	Righteousness doesn't always make you right, and I'll be the first to say that.
9369720	9375800	I think the issue is that even to this day, a lot of us tend to base our beliefs as a reaction to the environments around us,
9375800	9377480	rather than the bigger picture.
9377480	9380120	Okay, good. Okay. Well, ask him.
9380120	9383320	Get him a check if we're shutting this big ground.
9383320	9390120	Now, if you do not listen to her, your event will be shut down right now.
9390120	9395160	Right now. Your decision. Make a decision now.
9395160	9400680	We will let, we won't, no, we are going to, we are going to let you on the mic.
9400680	9402680	Do not silence her.
9402760	9407480	Okay. All right. So we are trying to be reasonable.
9407480	9410920	We are trying to be reasonable. We are trying to be reasonable.
9413640	9417080	We're going to give you, we're going to let you on the mic.
9417080	9418520	We are going to give you the mic.
9419880	9426200	Well, after Senator Sanders, after Senator Sanders, after Senator Sanders.
9433400	9440200	In fact, then, given how someone documented to have been behaving, it made Blair's existence as a creator easier to justify,
9440200	9444600	and consequently normalized a lot of the actions that we now reflect on with distaste.
9444600	9449880	However, over the years, for a lot of people, it's been about understanding that actually, even if the previous criticisms
9449880	9455400	leveled towards certain individuals may be valid, it doesn't mandate complete opposition to them or their ideology.
9455400	9460280	In the case of Blair, this sense of closure seems to have been replaced with a greater and greater straw man
9460280	9465400	of what these people may collectively want and why it's wrong, despite the fact that there isn't necessarily
9465400	9469400	a clear consensus that could easily define their interest beyond acceptance.
9469400	9474840	This then leads to certain sweeping statements and comments which may as well be from those on the other side of the aisle.
9474840	9479960	I've been there before, trying to fight the middle ground because you see people who claim to speak for your interests
9479960	9485560	who don't even want to consider your own opinion as a member of that group, but at the same time arguing for the contrary
9485560	9488920	without the conscious recognition of that can be just as destructive.
9488920	9494040	I remember uploading a video myself towards the end of 2017 on Riley Dent's when I was in that genre,
9494040	9500440	which would be chronologically after Blair had apologized to Riley, and even though I expressed my many disagreements with her,
9500440	9504440	the most backlash I received was for actually addressing her as a woman.
9504440	9509960	For many in that genre, the damage had already been done, and I think there's a point where you have to recognize
9509960	9515400	that when you position yourself against people, you're just playing into the division that you seem so driven to resolve.
9515400	9521240	Blair appeared to have that realization herself, but then just regressed back to it, just for a different set of people.
9521240	9529560	In a way she hasn't changed, she just goes after people who are indisputably terrible, and uses it to indirectly demean their trans identity instead,
9529560	9532760	and sometimes she just doesn't even go after people who are terrible anyway.
9532760	9539000	In 2020, the year where I think everyone was just about tired of smoke and mirrors, the extremes we were being drew into,
9539000	9544360	Blair may have been looked towards as a saving grace, but I think it ultimately led to her position being unraveled
9544360	9550360	because people had enough. Those who didn't believe her position as the creator standing up for common sense was legitimate.
9550360	9556680	Common sense isn't built on one's sense of centrism or compromise, it's built on a philosophy that values information,
9556680	9561640	research, and rigorous discourse, whether that leads to positions that are left or right wing.
9561640	9567720	And that's the thing, anyone could go over Blair's videos, pick apart every time she's wrong, every time she's been reckless,
9567720	9573640	or irresponsible, reprimand her, but that wouldn't make you better than her, and it certainly doesn't make me better than her.
9573720	9579880	Everyone fucks up. The difference is that Blair's problem is one that fundamentally underlines her career on YouTube,
9579880	9586600	her own philosophy, which is continuously laid more and more bare every time she makes the exact same mistakes.
9586600	9595400	It's not a popular opinion, it's not a politically correct opinion, but I've never been one for political correctness, so yeah.
9595400	9599400	Back when she started, you could see the potential for the creator that she is today.
9599400	9605720	Her channel always felt like a very personal venture, with many videos discussing her experiences and stories.
9605720	9613720	However, there were also prevalent flaws which showed her nature to jump to conclusions, and points that felt strained to prove a greater thesis which wasn't always there.
9613720	9619160	At the same time, there were definitely reasons to think she could alleviate these, she used some references here and there,
9619160	9626360	seemed quite open to discussion, and was definitely part of a greater community which could be partially accountable for the atmosphere that bred certain behaviours.
9626360	9635480	Yet, that just hasn't happened. In a way, Blair White is the only YouTuber I've come across who uses less references in her videos now than when she started,
9635480	9639160	despite the fact that I'd argue it's more important than any time before.
9639160	9648040	Calling out people for heinous actions gives you a greater imperative to justify it, whether other people assume it to be true or not, whether it has been established.
9648120	9658440	Also, it's really not missed on me that in recent years, it seems like a really cheap, easy way to get a lot of media attention for celebrities to come out as they, them, and non-binary and trans and all that.
9658440	9663240	And of course, it's very convenient to come out as a they, them, because you don't have to actually commit to any sort of transition.
9663240	9672200	Courtney Stodden, Sam Smith, the guy from Queer Eye whose name I can't remember, the one who looks like Jesus, the actor we talked about earlier with Tree and Tree Self,
9672200	9681720	I'm literally just so many more I can't even think of, and I'm not saying every single one of them is disingenuine, but like, it's a little too convenient that it's just one after another, after another, after another,
9681720	9687560	when you know that if this was 2014 or 2013 before this was even a trend, they would not be coming out.
9687560	9693960	Given the fact that the only real influential variable that has remained consistent is that personal sentiment she appears to possess,
9693960	9700840	many people feel that she is attempting to separate herself in a way to obtain acceptance from those who may be more skeptical of certain identities.
9700920	9707560	If that's how she personally feels, then I can't take that away from her, but it's not how you run a channel that claims to be bridging the divide,
9707560	9710880	given how much her personal sentiments surface in those videos.
9710880	9716960	I don't think society is a negotiation table where you bargain who's going to be accepted to satisfy the most individuals.
9716960	9721040	In the grand scheme of things, that's not moderation to me, it's appeasement.
9721040	9725320	Moderation isn't only about what opinions you have, though it does influence it.
9725320	9730120	It is a state of mind, and on too many occasions, Blair failed to exercise it.
9730120	9735680	I wouldn't care if you were a conservative, liberal, or progressive, that stands independently to me.
9735680	9739960	That duty couldn't be more valuable, as Blair had soon warned herself into the mainstream.
9739960	9746480	People wanted that recognition of nuance, that attention to detail, the moral obligation, but they didn't find it,
9746480	9751800	because Blair's opinions often didn't extend in a way that went beyond counter-cultural conservatism.
9751800	9756880	That whole counter-culture position never felt like it had too many beliefs to stand on on its own merit,
9756880	9761320	and you can only be against so many people before those around you wonder what you're really for.
9761320	9767280	If you don't back up your positions, then what reason do people have to trust you over those you paint as the extremists,
9767280	9769960	some of whom hardly have the most extreme views?
9769960	9777520	If Blair wants to give us moderation, she has to represent the other side, rather than just her response to assumed absolutists.
9777720	9783400	There is a discussion about trans people, included or excluded from it, and what is the right way to navigate, right?
9783400	9788280	And my friend and I both agree that the trans community, as it stands now, will never achieve full acceptance,
9788280	9796880	and how we've almost noticed an uptick in, like, anti-trans people, and almost like a resurgence of people
9796880	9803000	who, like, straight up don't like trans people, don't get it, are very turned off by the community and by trans ideology,
9803000	9806040	and then actually lash out at us, like, in an anti-trans way.
9806080	9811800	As many other creators have already observed, there are other individuals who cover a variety of trans issues in a balanced
9811800	9818600	and detailed way, and in much more depth, some of whom have gone to lengths in the past to correct some of Blair's shortcomings.
9818600	9823560	I don't think this means that Blair's perhaps lightweight content should be banished from the platform,
9823560	9830120	but I think it also has to be done with perspective for what it represents, and at least with an active effort to distinguish
9830120	9835560	at what point should be drawn from such an upload. Otherwise, people give it too much consequence in what it could say
9835560	9841080	about communities, and she needs to be more mindful when dealing with the topics that do carry that substance.
9841080	9846600	Blair needs to be more sensitive on that front, whether she wants to pertain that nonchalant brazen attitude or not.
9846600	9850840	She's still a creator who takes themselves seriously enough to make videos about online scoundrels,
9850840	9855560	alongside some pretty strong words. These things have consequence.
9855560	9862280	But sometimes things just cross the line, and on several occasions, I cross the line, and I'm sorry.
9862280	9865880	We've all learned the hard way, but we own it, and we work out how to improve.
9865880	9871320	Yet, over the years, the changes to Blair's channel feel cosmetic, made to present the feeling of progression,
9871320	9877960	some apologies, some alleged reconciliation, but you strip away the makeup, and it's the same foundation that it was before.
9877960	9884120	And as the internet changed, those flaws became clear. Makeup is temporary, what's underneath is permanent.
9884120	9888200	And I'll make this clear, I think Blair is far from the worst political creator on YouTube,
9888200	9893800	but she suffered the most because she played the riskiest game, her audience held her in very high regard.
9893800	9897960	She appealed to those in the mainstream, some of whom very conscious of their ideas,
9897960	9903400	and still piled straw onto the beleaguered camel. A part of me believes that she does hold her beliefs close to her heart,
9903400	9908280	because as she said herself, much of her failure to present solid information isn't the best option,
9908280	9914040	but she continues to do it, yet a connection to a bygone era that may be worth letting go.
9914120	9919000	Through old friends, and new enemies, and the incessant drama, time may have passed,
9919000	9923720	but she remains ever present, and as she does, I hope she pays these thoughts some consideration.
9923720	9930440	The world is changing, and as we move towards 2022, it should be clear that moderation needs to be more than just a buzzword.
9930440	9936440	It needs to be backed up, you can't just play both teams, or expect your character will be defined off the back of who you call out alone.
9936440	9940120	Blair set a higher bar than she could obtain, and ultimately paid the price for it.
9940120	9944840	Whether she'll continue to do so will depend on how she goes forward, I just hope she doesn't go back.
9946520	9947240	Thank you.
9951240	9957160	So that was the video, and a big thank you as always, a very, very long one, but I hope you enjoyed it nonetheless.
9957160	9964040	I want to give big thanks to the editors who have done a fantastic job, I'll be putting all their links in the pinned comment,
9964040	9968920	so be sure to check them out if you liked what they did, big shout out to Logan as always, post editing,
9968920	9975160	titers have a great work, thanks to Linuski for the music, and Staffo for the thumbnail, just great work all round,
9975160	9980120	and I really appreciate everyone who helped out, who watched the video, who gave me their feedback before the release,
9980120	9985480	so thank you so much. I also want to give thanks to the artists, they'll be in the pinned comment as well,
9985480	9989560	and of course the lovely low patrons, the $10 patrons who will be shown on screen right now,
9989560	9997400	but also a special thanks to my $50 patrons, Hypercube, GothCreamPuff, CatEars.jpg, and Esther Padoya,
9997400	10005400	what a great set of names we have there, and also a very special thanks to my $100 patrons, Marlowe and Kiel Lomeland,
10005400	10012360	I'm not entirely sure how I pronounce that, but you can always message me and give me feedback on that one, Kiel.
10012480	10019800	Otherwise, my social medias, I don't really use them, but they're there, and of course the references will be at the bottom of the pinned comments as well,
10019800	10023880	in case you want to check out the links for yourself. Big thanks again to everyone who helped out,
10023880	10029960	much love to everyone who supported me, I know uploads have been a bit slow, but hopefully they can return to a decent pace soon,
10029960	10036760	though I doubt this will be the last slightly contentious topic that I'll be covering, so get ready for some vigorous debate at least.
10036800	10045880	I don't really have too much else to say, so I'll wrap it up there, thank you again all for your support on this monster of a video if you made it to this part where I just talk randomly,
10045880	10052040	thank you everyone, take care, take care, I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you in the next one.
10066760	10070760	Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
