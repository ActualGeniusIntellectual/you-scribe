00:00.000 --> 00:19.960
Hello ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Right Opinion, the home of a twat with too much free time,

00:19.960 --> 00:23.280
and 2020, not the most enjoyable year to say the least.

00:23.280 --> 00:28.280
I recall back to my Q&A in March, when the Nostradamus Opinion announced that the year seemed to be calming down,

00:28.280 --> 00:33.000
which in hindsight was a slightly misguided forecast, in fact, I'd positively say it was a kiss of death,

00:33.000 --> 00:36.280
as the world has careened towards its frankly well-deserved Armageddon.

00:36.280 --> 00:42.200
I've honestly not handled it too well personally, to see so much going on makes me want to curl up in a ball and hibernate,

00:42.200 --> 00:45.080
or estivate if you consider when all this was happening.

00:45.080 --> 00:51.280
At the same time, there's always reason within the chaos, and I've always lived by the philosophy that I emerge from hardships of wiser man,

00:51.280 --> 00:55.040
and a part of me hopes that would be similarly applicable on a macro level as well,

00:55.040 --> 01:00.160
however, we'll never reach that if we can't have a proper, mature discussion to understand how such discord has arisen,

01:00.160 --> 01:04.680
and at times when emotions can run high, we often need voices of reason to lead that discourse forward,

01:04.680 --> 01:07.040
so that we can all learn from such adversities.

01:07.040 --> 01:11.880
In the past few years in particular, I feel that YouTube has become increasingly integral to that conversation,

01:11.880 --> 01:17.640
introducing a new generation to the many complex, and sometimes, not so complex matters facing down today's youth,

01:17.640 --> 01:22.800
with online creators engaging audiences through fresh mediums, acquainting them with new ideas and perspectives.

01:22.840 --> 01:28.280
Although the nature of my channel can be a little biographical, I hope that people have found value in the viewpoints I have to share,

01:28.280 --> 01:31.280
and you know what, I'd say the feedback has been broadly positive.

01:31.280 --> 01:35.600
One way that people recognise the work you do often is what some regard as year-end lists,

01:35.600 --> 01:41.000
where individuals compile a selection of their favourite creators and post it to their preferred social media site.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.120
At the end of 2019, I was once again honoured by being placed amongst YouTubers who put great effort into their respective hustle,

01:47.120 --> 01:51.800
however, one name whose presence I was surprised to see was a commentator by the name of Blair White.

01:52.040 --> 02:00.960
Oh hi, welcome back to my channel. So you guys are currently in bed with me, which not a lot of people can say because I am very innocent.

02:00.960 --> 02:07.400
Blair White is a creator who has been on the platform for a good few years, and has spent her time mostly preoccupied with sociopolitical commentary.

02:07.400 --> 02:13.400
She presents her perspective from quite a unique angle, espousing conservative leaning narratives which wouldn't be too exceptional on paper,

02:13.400 --> 02:17.800
but is somewhat intriguing when you juxtapose this ideology with the fact that Blair is transgender.

02:17.800 --> 02:25.320
A lot of the times on this channel and on my social media, I'm presenting a sort of side to the trans topic that not many people are used to seeing.

02:25.320 --> 02:29.720
I don't talk about things in the way that every single other trans influencer in the world talks about.

02:29.720 --> 02:34.840
I don't talk about things in the way that every other trans activist you've ever seen talks about them. I am different.

02:34.840 --> 02:40.480
These two positions aren't entirely incompatible, but when considering that the doctrine of social conservatism in particular

02:40.480 --> 02:48.000
has often been quite hostile to LGBT rights, it would seem that adopting this outlook would be counterintuitive for anyone of that demographic's denomination.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.120
However, with young republicans and conservatives seeming to be more amenable to pro-LGBT policy, the setting of an online platform aimed at a younger,

02:55.120 --> 03:04.000
more broad-minded audience could not be more alluring to those who may find themselves set apart from their stereotypes by their beliefs, identity, or in this instance even, both.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.120
Since launching her channel in 2016, Blair has amassed over a million subscribers, garnering a dedicated fanbase eager to see her

03:10.160 --> 03:14.160
tackle subjects which can often be highly consequential for the parties involved.

03:14.160 --> 03:21.160
In many ways, her personal experience as a transgender individual allowed her to provide a new energy to previously archaic conservative narratives

03:21.160 --> 03:25.640
that were often weighed down by their inherent lack of empathy for the individuals at the heart of the discussion,

03:25.640 --> 03:30.320
while also correcting misconceptions that had previously been peddled about Blair and many of her peers.

03:30.320 --> 03:37.640
To those who admired her, and perhaps to Blair herself, White was a bridge between previously estranged communities who on the surface had very little in common.

03:37.680 --> 03:44.120
However, unlike some political commentators who have sprung up in the last few years, Blair was never exactly renowned for her diplomatic demeanour.

03:44.120 --> 03:49.440
If you're trans, you don't have the right to share an opinion like this, for which I actually quote tweeted them and said,

03:49.440 --> 03:51.440
I'm trans, idiot!

03:51.440 --> 03:59.240
They criticised me for being a transmedicalist, which is me believing that being trans is a medical issue because that's exactly what it is.

03:59.240 --> 04:04.360
And just really mad that I don't think non-binary people are the same thing as trans. Too bad, too sad. Whatever.

04:04.360 --> 04:11.480
In fact, from my perspective, she had been a divisive figure from since I could remember, and therefore, when seeing her alongside a fair few marred-mannered creators,

04:11.480 --> 04:17.280
I was surprised. Now, I don't follow too many commentators outside my sphere, but I stay in the loop with all the current affairs,

04:17.280 --> 04:21.960
and it was intriguing that someone who I knew for being moderately contentious among communities, to put it mildly,

04:21.960 --> 04:26.160
had won over the hearts of those who would typically steer clear of that brand of content.

04:26.160 --> 04:30.080
However, I decided not to investigate further because it wasn't really of much concern to me.

04:30.080 --> 04:33.920
If she was making content that went down with a wider spectrum of viewers, then good for her.

04:33.920 --> 04:38.840
Nonetheless, there was this lingering expectation in the back of my head, this may not be the last that I hear from her,

04:38.840 --> 04:43.920
given that she was still outspoken on many issues, some of which would put her into conflict with some of her audience.

04:43.920 --> 04:49.280
Yet, she may well have evolved, and in her videos, she definitely seemed to purport herself as a reasonable medium.

04:49.280 --> 04:54.120
No, there are normal trans people out there who don't believe all these radical things.

04:54.120 --> 04:58.200
And why don't those trans people get a voice? You know, there's so many people who talk about how, like,

04:58.200 --> 05:03.320
every trans story needs to be heard, and we have to listen to trans people, and blah, blah, blah, and like, cool, that's great,

05:03.320 --> 05:08.040
but why is it only on your terms? Why is there one narrative? And if we don't follow it, then no,

05:08.040 --> 05:10.720
everyone should be heard but Blair White. Like, what are we doing?

05:10.720 --> 05:15.600
Moderation. It's an important facet in 2020, with the post-election landscape to dwell on,

05:15.600 --> 05:21.600
a president-elect who pledged to take the US back to some normality, yet a residual skepticism of real change,

05:21.600 --> 05:26.560
and polarized tension that seemed hard to palliate. Many of her fans would have argued that Blair's place could not have

05:26.560 --> 05:29.960
been more essential in healing the wounds that so many had sustained that year.

05:29.960 --> 05:34.880
Unfortunately, although some may have longed for her wisdom in this critical time, it was instead about to be the subject

05:34.880 --> 05:40.440
of an investigation, which provoked by an avoidable incident, would drag much of her past back into light,

05:40.440 --> 05:46.680
and bring into question that self-acclaimed reputation of a reasonable, rational, and logical voice amongst all the havoc,

05:46.680 --> 05:52.120
with former fans and foes asking if actually she had been the instigator of this havoc all along.

05:52.120 --> 05:56.920
I have thousands of people write to me every single day that they are so disgusted with the way that trans people are portrayed

05:56.920 --> 06:01.960
in the media, all because this is how trans activists, and the more radical people on the end of the spectrum,

06:01.960 --> 06:03.760
are dictating it be portrayed.

06:03.760 --> 06:08.680
Well, to answer that curious query, I suppose it's about time we take a look for ourselves, and to do so,

06:08.680 --> 06:13.320
I'd like to go right back to 2015, where the Blair White YouTube story all began.

06:13.320 --> 06:19.400
So if you'd care to join me on this journey, you'd be most welcome. Without further ado, let us commence.

06:19.400 --> 06:27.960
— 2015 YouTube. How does one characterise it?

06:41.480 --> 06:44.680
— Saying Sean King is white when he's white is incendiary.

06:44.680 --> 06:48.680
Christ menstruating with tits isn't incendiary.

06:48.760 --> 06:52.120
— I'm here to ask questions, and it seems like you guys aren't very open to them.

06:52.120 --> 06:57.160
— For many years, YouTube had been the platform dominated by creators who didn't appear to take themselves too seriously.

06:57.160 --> 07:02.280
However, this had been gradually evolving, and by the end of 2015, this transformation was mostly complete.

07:02.280 --> 07:08.440
Now, there were still entertainers galore, but a more prominent role had been occupied by a political clique known to some as the Skeptics,

07:08.440 --> 07:11.800
the title acquired from their responses to eccentric religious zealots.

07:11.800 --> 07:17.880
Some of the creators in the community were more lighthearted in their narratives, merely mocking their subjects and providing casual repulsive,

07:17.880 --> 07:23.960
while others tended to attack the specific fabric of arguments quite aggressively, even being quite provocative themselves.

07:23.960 --> 07:33.960
— If we come from monkeys, then why are there still monkeys? And who is giving them markers and pieces of paper to write on?

07:33.960 --> 07:39.400
— In spite of this, by the present year, many YouTubers in this field were also referred to as anti-SJWs,

07:39.400 --> 07:44.040
an acronym for Social Justice Warrior, because they had shifted their focus towards other targets,

07:44.040 --> 07:49.480
many of whom were treated with absurdity or incredulity, either in their arguments or their attitudes.

07:49.480 --> 07:54.600
Now, not all skeptics went on to be anti-SJWs, and some in fact became very critical of that movement.

07:54.600 --> 08:00.520
However, this movement also seemed to broadly merge with creators who had not necessarily made anti-creationist content prior,

08:00.520 --> 08:07.240
some of whom, gamers, others just casual creators turned commentators, mobilised by incidents such as the infamous gamer gate,

08:07.240 --> 08:10.280
or just general antics that they felt were worth calling out.

08:10.280 --> 08:23.460
— ...overprofessional goals, plus minimising their own

08:23.460 --> 08:27.320
— Of many online, it was not hard to see why. They were generally not the most personable individuals,

08:27.320 --> 08:30.920
often presenting their somewhat radical ideas in a rather disagreeable fashion,

08:30.920 --> 08:38.120
and this subsequently made them quite easy prey for the enlightened commentator who'd regularly descend from the heavens to put the half-wits in their place.

08:38.120 --> 08:44.040
I even dabbled in it here and there myself, though that year I must say I had more pressing matters to attend to.

08:44.040 --> 08:55.720
— What I do understand is that Jeremy Hunt is not qualified to run the NHS. His approval rating lies at 17%. 17 fucking percent.

08:55.720 --> 09:00.920
Fantastic Four has a better public rating. Fantastic fucking four.

09:00.920 --> 09:03.720
— Damn, I really put those politicians in their place.

09:03.720 --> 09:09.880
— Anyhow, turning back to this genre of creators, in reflection, it's very easy to look back at that social zeitgeist in a sneering fashion,

09:09.880 --> 09:14.520
but there were many who were very invested from a variety of political factions, because at the time,

09:14.520 --> 09:20.200
I feel that what a lot of these self-proclaimed advocates of social justice represented to these creators and audiences alike

09:20.200 --> 09:25.720
was an attack on an internet culture quite sacred at the time, and one heavily exhibited in a variety of content,

09:25.720 --> 09:28.280
the sort of edge without any real weight behind it.

09:28.280 --> 09:33.480
— I will see how it goes after a week. Can we do next promotion? Hell yeah, yellow n***a.

09:33.480 --> 09:37.880
At the same time, it's important not to undersell the level of political engagement in a lot of these videos.

09:37.880 --> 09:41.880
There was a lot more at stake than just what happened online, and a lot more depth to the discourse,

09:41.880 --> 09:47.000
particularly contained within a multitude of social issues which had seeped onto the platform as tensions in the real world

09:47.000 --> 09:53.000
appeared to be rising with the impending plebiscites. It was an exciting time to be a creator in that genre,

09:53.000 --> 09:58.040
and more people wanted to be involved, one of those being our fabled title character.

09:58.040 --> 10:03.320
At this moment, Blair was a computer science student at the California State University Chico campus,

10:03.320 --> 10:07.400
however, she was not having the most fun with her life, feeling a bit outcast by her identity,

10:07.400 --> 10:13.640
a transgender, yet conservative leaning individual, a stark contrast to many of her liberal professors and fellow students.

10:13.640 --> 10:17.640
Like many others in such a position, Miss White found more at home in the online sphere,

10:17.640 --> 10:22.040
a place that she likely felt was more accommodating towards her beliefs and attitudes.

10:22.040 --> 10:26.760
In many ways, the online world has provided a protective enclave for a variety of identities,

10:26.760 --> 10:31.880
especially those that may face ostracism in real life. This was merely another branch of that outlet,

10:31.880 --> 10:35.960
who knows exactly when she decided to become a YouTuber, but a turning point appeared to be when

10:35.960 --> 10:40.280
she appeared on stream with Crayta, who we can assume to be Theron Meyer, based on the tweet,

10:40.280 --> 10:44.760
and obviously based on the archive of the video. It seems that many people encouraged her to start

10:44.760 --> 10:48.840
uploading her own content, and not too long after, her first video was published.

10:48.840 --> 10:53.800
BLAIR Hello, my name is Blair, for those of you who don't know, and in this video, I'm going to be discussing

10:53.800 --> 10:57.720
a few related topics, one being feminism, the next being the men's rights movement,

10:58.680 --> 11:05.800
also the concepts of privilege, both male and female privilege, and just kind of my thoughts on all those things.

11:05.800 --> 11:10.120
TRO Now, Theron, whose stream Blair had made the aforementioned appearance on, was a creator mostly

11:10.120 --> 11:14.040
focused around advocating for men's rights at the time, and therefore, it made sense that Blair's

11:14.040 --> 11:18.840
maiden video covers similar talking points. The upload in question is titled Female Privilege,

11:18.840 --> 11:23.400
and as the title implies, it seeks to observe various deficits in society, where women actually

11:23.400 --> 11:28.440
possess an advantage over their male counterparts, seemingly in contrast to many narratives disseminated

11:28.440 --> 11:30.200
by accredited institutes.

11:30.200 --> 11:34.680
BLAIR I've lived my life on both sides of the coin, per se, at different periods of my life.

11:35.480 --> 11:41.080
I think I definitely am in a position to critique the concept of privilege, as it's perpetuated by

11:41.080 --> 11:45.800
feminist ideology. So there was a shift that happened in the way that the world interacted with me,

11:45.800 --> 11:50.920
as I went further into my transition, sort of the way that strangers interacted with me, the way I was

11:50.920 --> 11:57.640
treated, it all changed. It manifested in ways such as doors being held open for me, seats on

11:57.640 --> 12:03.240
public transportation being surrendered instantly, really. The term ladies first is definitely

12:03.240 --> 12:06.360
something that's actually implemented, it's not just a phrase.

12:06.360 --> 12:11.080
TRO However, Blair also uses the video to express her own personal investments, and experiences given

12:11.080 --> 12:15.080
her a rather unique background in this dialogue. As a person who has transitioned, Blair sees

12:15.080 --> 12:19.480
herself as someone who has encountered both sides of the gender coin, and thus also the privileges

12:19.480 --> 12:24.040
and drawbacks of constructs often bestowed onto such identities, implying this provides her with

12:24.040 --> 12:29.080
unique insight onto the topic, juxtaposing these differing experiences. She calls upon personal

12:29.080 --> 12:32.680
observations, before sharing some hard-hitting statistics with her viewers.

12:32.680 --> 12:38.680
BLAIR The truth is that men make up 80% of suicides, nearly half of all domestic violence victims,

12:38.680 --> 12:42.520
more men in the US are raped, that is when you factor in prison statistics,

12:43.240 --> 12:49.560
77% of homicide victims, 93% of workplace deaths, 88% of homeless individuals are male,

12:50.200 --> 12:55.080
and they're constantly screwed over in child custody and alimony cases.

12:55.080 --> 12:59.400
TRO This sort of content was hardly exceptional, mostly parroting core talking points made by a lot

12:59.400 --> 13:03.800
of its proponents, however, as a cornerstone for what her content was to become, it seemed to lay

13:03.800 --> 13:08.680
the framework quite nicely. Her tone, although stern, was not hostile, her sources, occasional

13:08.680 --> 13:12.600
spelling error aside, are cited, and her production, although somewhat lacking, still

13:12.600 --> 13:17.000
allowed for content to be digestible. To be frank, a lot of political content back then consisted of

13:17.000 --> 13:21.160
an avatar that, if you were lucky, moved its arms up and down, so to have a fully expressive

13:21.160 --> 13:24.440
individual talking about these topics may have been considered a blessing to many.

13:24.440 --> 13:28.600
BLAIR These numbers definitely seem unfamiliar to most people, I know they definitely were to me

13:28.600 --> 13:33.960
when I started researching all of these things, but the reason they seem so unfamiliar, and maybe

13:34.040 --> 13:38.760
even not so believable, is because feminism does not even allow the conversation to be had.

13:38.760 --> 13:43.080
TRO As an upload, Blair White's anti-feminist stance didn't tell us much about the world,

13:43.080 --> 13:46.040
but it did tell us a bit about Blair, however, there was more to come,

13:46.040 --> 13:52.360
and first impressions can only tell us so much. BLAIR So those are my thoughts on the topics at

13:52.360 --> 13:59.160
hand, and I definitely want anyone who disagrees with me to comment, because I am open to people

13:59.160 --> 14:04.680
disagreeing with me, I like having my views challenged, and I am willing to change my mind

14:04.680 --> 14:11.800
if I'm proven wrong, so bye. TRO Blair's first upload was met with thoughts from many within

14:11.800 --> 14:15.240
the community that she was appealing to, particularly given her mostly forthcoming

14:15.240 --> 14:19.960
tone and open-minded outlook. Nonetheless, it was more than that, due to the previously expressed

14:19.960 --> 14:24.200
contrast of Blair's gender identity with her political identity, and how she used it in

14:24.200 --> 14:39.160
discourse. In a way, it dynamically flipped a narrative that had been traditionally associated

14:39.160 --> 14:43.720
with fairly progressive circles, the reference to how one's experience and identity can often shape

14:43.720 --> 14:48.120
their viewpoints, often being used as a stimulus to call for more diversity in certain intellectual

14:48.120 --> 14:52.280
circles. Here we had someone who represented that diverse upbringing, but whose ideological

14:52.280 --> 14:56.360
path diverged from that which would be expected of someone who was stereotypically associated

14:56.360 --> 15:01.240
with her demographic. Many clearly welcomed this, though you may be justified in finding

15:01.240 --> 15:06.280
some people's enthusiasm a little nauseating. At the same time, as she acknowledges herself,

15:06.280 --> 15:11.240
she still passes as a cis woman in many spaces, so her perspective is somewhat different to that

15:11.240 --> 15:15.240
of other trans people who may be subjected to stigma relating to their appearance.

15:16.200 --> 15:21.240
But I am lucky enough that I can enter most public spaces, and the world does interact with me as a

15:21.240 --> 15:24.920
woman, not as a trans person or as a man.

15:24.920 --> 15:28.680
Now, there were many criticisms that could be levelled towards her narratives, particularly

15:28.680 --> 15:33.720
given her tendency to conflate her specific experience as a woman with female experiences

15:33.720 --> 15:37.560
in general, an issue that would rear its head in future escapades. However, she didn't seem

15:37.560 --> 15:41.640
averse to criticism, and still pointed towards clear systemic inequalities that should be

15:41.720 --> 15:46.680
addressed. As first videos go, it could be worse, and her next few videos followed a similar pattern.

15:47.320 --> 15:53.880
He tells a story, and I don't remember exactly what his situation was, but basically, his situation

15:53.880 --> 15:58.120
was worse than any girls in this class who talked about how their boyfriend used to verbally abuse

15:58.120 --> 16:05.000
them, or used to hit them, or used to grab them, whatever. Everyone in the class started laughing.

16:05.000 --> 16:13.880
Literally. I think the only person that didn't laugh was the f***ing me, and the instructor,

16:13.880 --> 16:19.800
the professor. And the truth is, you know, more women in the US are affected by domestic violence

16:19.800 --> 16:29.080
in terms of being victims, but it's something like over 40% are men, so it's not like it's 90-10

16:29.080 --> 16:35.320
or 80-20, it's like 60-40, and I would venture to guess that it might even be closer to 50-50

16:35.320 --> 16:40.680
if you take into account the fact that men don't talk about it, and when they do, they get f***ing

16:40.680 --> 16:46.280
laughed at. And it does intersperse with some factual information, often as a secondary feature.

16:46.280 --> 16:50.680
This isn't to a detriment, and there are many perceptual benefits to this, such as a more intimate

16:50.680 --> 16:54.760
relationship between the creator and their audience, but it also means there is a sense of trust

16:54.760 --> 16:58.600
that needs to be invested in the creator. For some people, that degree of trust needs to be earned,

16:58.600 --> 17:02.920
but if you're speaking to a believable experience that resonates with people, then the threshold is

17:02.920 --> 17:07.400
often lowered, so certain stories of institutional intolerance may hit closer to home for some

17:07.400 --> 17:12.200
individuals, particularly if it fits into their worldview. And back then, the idea of vicious,

17:12.200 --> 17:16.360
college-dwelling feminists who added in for every cursed bloke who had ever set foot on Earth wasn't

17:16.360 --> 17:20.120
one that seemed far-fetched at all, especially with the prevailing narratives in many of these

17:20.120 --> 17:23.880
communities, substantiated by many, frankly, unflattering clips.

17:23.960 --> 17:29.880
What? Humongous what? Humongous what? Humongous what? Humongous what?

17:31.000 --> 17:35.480
This person just spoke to me in a sexually harassing way.

17:35.480 --> 17:36.600
Yeah, he did.

17:36.600 --> 17:41.240
Blair's early output was definitely built on a somewhat personal connection between herself and the audience.

17:41.240 --> 17:45.640
This could also be reflected in the fact that her fourth video was a Q&A, surprisingly premature for

17:45.640 --> 17:49.720
a channel's lifespan, but she portrayed herself as an open book who felt comfortable divulging

17:49.720 --> 17:53.320
details about her life, which consequently commanded a lot of respect from her viewers.

17:53.320 --> 17:57.160
However, at the same time, this personal journey granted her with a lot of flexibility in the

17:57.160 --> 18:01.160
topics she could tackle, and with each subject she approached, we seemed to learn more about her,

18:01.160 --> 18:05.640
and her curious opinions. Her videos were even structured in a way so that they would follow on

18:05.640 --> 18:10.440
previous theses, though this may alienate people who don't necessarily agree with her presuppositions,

18:10.440 --> 18:15.080
especially ones that kind of assumed that she was correct, which wouldn't necessarily be the case.

18:15.720 --> 18:20.440
So now that we're all in agreeance that feminism is indeed cancer, let us take a look at the ways

18:20.440 --> 18:27.080
in which feminism is, like a virus, able to spread its misinformation, half-truths, blatant lies,

18:27.080 --> 18:29.320
and overall retardedness through the internet.

18:29.320 --> 18:33.960
Oh, okay, I guess we established that then. The thing is that it's hard to go along with these

18:33.960 --> 18:37.720
assumptions when a lot of Blair's points aren't the most ironclad, and to be brutally honest,

18:37.720 --> 18:42.120
Blair's content didn't particularly stand out in the points that she made from a lot of other creators,

18:42.120 --> 18:44.200
sometimes falling quite short.

18:44.200 --> 18:50.120
And it's true that women do have a higher pressure to look youthful and to stay young because we do

18:50.120 --> 18:56.520
value that in women within this culture, but that expectation is directly perpetuated by women.

18:58.120 --> 19:03.800
The billion-dollar beauty industry, which is advertising anti-aging creams and

19:05.400 --> 19:12.760
Botox and things like that, those are largely ran by women, made for women. So if this meme is

19:12.760 --> 19:17.480
trying to imply that men are doing this to women, it's actually not true.

19:17.480 --> 19:21.640
This is from a video titled Feminism is Pointless, though it was very charmingly titled

19:21.640 --> 19:26.120
Feminism is Cancer at one point, where Blair reacts to a slew of memes that vary in their

19:26.120 --> 19:30.520
logical soundness, but also expose some of Blair's internal biases, such as the one shown in that

19:30.520 --> 19:35.000
curious clip. Now, even if Blair was correct in her assertion regarding industry leaders,

19:35.000 --> 19:38.840
it wouldn't necessarily be a valid response because the meme was a critique of society,

19:38.840 --> 19:43.400
rather than men specifically, and it never asserted that men presently were the sole cause of harsher

19:43.400 --> 19:48.040
beauty standards that were often imposed onto women, an issue that Blair acknowledges as

19:48.040 --> 19:52.920
existent right off the bat. Now, as noted, this is freshman content from our budding creators,

19:52.920 --> 19:57.960
so we can't expect everything to fall into place perfectly. I'm sure I and many other creators were

19:57.960 --> 20:02.840
hardly producing content of the highest order at this size, but it was symptomatic of that desire

20:02.840 --> 20:06.520
to prove a point, even when there wasn't one to be proven exactly.

20:06.520 --> 20:11.960
So this one's cute. It's a picture of a feminist father wearing a shirt explaining that when it

20:11.960 --> 20:17.080
comes to dating his daughter, he doesn't make the rules, and her daughter's boyfriend does not make

20:17.080 --> 20:22.200
the rules. So if you want to stick a blowtorch up his daughter's asshole and tell her to pretend to

20:22.200 --> 20:29.000
be a Charmander, he's fine with that because it's her body. Uh, thank you for your contribution,

20:29.000 --> 20:33.800
Blair. Yes, in spite of the personal tone and story shared, it feels like there is still a

20:33.800 --> 20:38.360
default back to a generic narrative employed by a lot of creators around that time.

20:38.440 --> 20:43.480
It's really frustrating to me that we live in a climate where there's all this discussion of gender

20:43.480 --> 20:48.360
politics, and these conversations often include things like manspreading, and mansplaining,

20:48.360 --> 20:54.360
and catcalling, and we have this huge elephant in the room, 80% of suicide victims being male,

20:54.360 --> 20:59.480
and we're not talking about it. The hack need any way feminism bad, or strained what aboutisms.

20:59.480 --> 21:03.400
Sure, the number of men who take their own lives is undoubtedly alarming, but I don't know why that

21:03.400 --> 21:07.400
has to be compared to a discussion about catcalling, a behaviour which, I have to admit,

21:07.400 --> 21:12.280
I personally find rather grotesque. This is an example of what was indeed a greater problem in

21:12.280 --> 21:16.920
the community at the time, but also one found on the channel, being that it felt like Blair was

21:16.920 --> 21:20.920
drawn towards conclusions that would serve a specific agenda. This may have been a case of

21:20.920 --> 21:24.920
tunnel vision. When reviewing certain arguments, it becomes rather apparent.

21:24.920 --> 21:29.640
You have to question the motive of a person who's willing to be abused, willing to stay in a bad

21:29.640 --> 21:34.520
situation more than someone who's just a asshole who's gonna hurt someone regardless of who it is.

21:35.320 --> 21:40.280
There had to be something more to Blair, something that would elevate herself above the rote anti-SJW

21:40.280 --> 21:45.080
commentator. Well, there was. Her unique perspective and identity, right? Well,

21:45.080 --> 21:49.320
going off the first few videos, it was hard to exactly see how this influenced her worldview,

21:49.320 --> 21:52.040
but this was all about a change very soon.

22:05.480 --> 22:12.120
You know, what are the ramifications of being called a hoe by 40 people?

22:12.120 --> 22:16.680
It'll affect your social life, probably. It's embarrassing, probably.

22:16.680 --> 22:19.960
But what are the ramifications of being accused of being a rapist?

22:19.960 --> 22:24.440
You see, Blair's video responding to the feminist means was an interesting one in particular,

22:24.440 --> 22:28.200
because it definitely showcased a capacity for her to be a bit more assertive. As stated,

22:28.200 --> 22:32.440
there was a mixture of tones in which creators addressed the subjects of their videos. In earlier

22:32.440 --> 22:36.040
uploads, whether you agreed with Blair's conclusions or not, she didn't seem outwardly

22:36.040 --> 22:40.920
hostile, but this in particular seemed to be a pivot towards the combative content often tied to

22:40.920 --> 22:45.320
some of the edgier creators in the genre. At the same time, though, they were memes, and you could

22:45.320 --> 22:50.040
argue that she was at least mirroring the same energy that many of them emanated. It wasn't a

22:50.040 --> 22:55.240
typical Blair White video, no, I think the video of interest comes a couple uploads later.

22:55.240 --> 23:01.000
Hey guys, so one of the things people ask me about pretty often is my opinion on the sort of long list

23:01.000 --> 23:05.080
of arbitrary, obscure gender identities that exist out in the world.

23:05.080 --> 23:10.520
Which video could this be? Maybe it's the one titled Trans mentally challenged. I will expand

23:10.520 --> 23:14.680
on why this is, though once again, mostly serving as casual grounds for our channel's hostess to

23:14.680 --> 23:19.320
spew opinions on a hot topic is also a very relevant video, as for the first time, Blair's

23:19.320 --> 23:22.920
opinion on many trans issues is coming to the forefront of her brand.

23:22.920 --> 23:26.840
So yeah, I think all these identities are largely bullshit, I think they're super arbitrary,

23:26.840 --> 23:31.800
I think they're super meaningless, I think people who take them on are usually extremely

23:31.800 --> 23:37.880
boring and have nothing else for their personality other than I'm demi-queer, non-binary, gender

23:38.680 --> 23:44.680
special snowflake kin, and if you pay attention to these people, you'll notice that very rarely

23:44.680 --> 23:50.440
will you meet someone who identifies as one of these things who is not heavily involved in

23:50.440 --> 23:55.400
political activism to some extent. In the video, she dismisses individuals who lie outside the

23:55.400 --> 23:59.240
traditional gender binary, makes some pretty generalised, presumptive comments about their

23:59.240 --> 24:04.120
status and motives for assuming such identities, and in general comes off as quite elitist.

24:04.120 --> 24:09.240
These people are usually middle class, white, never had to struggle with anything in their life,

24:09.240 --> 24:15.080
but they want to call themselves a suppressed sexual gender minority as a means to silence

24:15.080 --> 24:19.400
any type of opposition they have in any type of political conversation, because in our current

24:19.400 --> 24:22.760
political climate, oppression is a very valuable currency.

24:22.760 --> 24:25.800
Now, I'm sure there are many responses one can formulate to her statements here,

24:25.800 --> 24:29.400
and comments that you and I are itching to make, but now I would like to put a pin on it,

24:29.400 --> 24:33.400
as I think we best keep an open mind and merely say that it serves as a good precedent for the

24:33.400 --> 24:37.560
content that was to follow, that rather noticeable distaste that Blair seemed to possess for those

24:37.560 --> 24:42.520
who fell outside the acceptability range of traditional gender norms. Yes, and as I noted

24:42.520 --> 24:46.600
before, when approaching topics on previous Discourse, even topics pertaining to gender,

24:46.600 --> 24:50.760
like the upload before, she seemed reasonable, but this was a turn, and this persisted in

24:50.760 --> 24:54.920
uploads following as well, not just in her tone, but in her attitude towards others,

24:54.920 --> 24:56.520
and I will elaborate here.

24:59.400 --> 25:04.120
I avoided explicitly mentioning the title of this upload, as it's not a term I tend to indulge,

25:04.120 --> 25:07.960
however, back then it was more than commonplace. In spite of this acknowledgement,

25:07.960 --> 25:12.040
Blair still weaponised it in a rather derogatory manner, and her subsequent uploads,

25:12.040 --> 25:17.400
although having more temperate titles, can often be found to have much more provocative captions

25:17.480 --> 25:22.600
at the time, thanks to Blair's extremely professional thumbnails, and thanks to the archives.

25:22.600 --> 25:28.520
For example, feminist thinks all men are rapists, or triggering trans... gender people.

25:28.520 --> 25:32.120
Damn it Blair, you really love a good slur in the worst of contexts.

25:32.120 --> 25:35.880
I'd like to say she rectified these outer remorse, but given the fact that she's left

25:35.880 --> 25:40.760
offensive terms in other titles, I assume it was to try and stop YouTube from demonetising or age

25:40.760 --> 25:45.320
restricting them, because in other places she's changed them when there really was no offensive

25:45.320 --> 25:49.720
term, just a sensitive word, such as this one where I assume racist obviously set off the YouTube

25:49.720 --> 25:55.080
alarm, so Blair, in a state of pure indolence, changed the title to just minorities,

25:55.080 --> 25:57.640
but as amusing as that is, I will move on for now.

26:00.680 --> 26:04.600
As said, this era was a curious one for sure, particularly for the political community online.

26:04.600 --> 26:08.600
It was one where many felt free from the shackles that had bound them in real life environments,

26:08.600 --> 26:12.760
and some clearly felt a catharsis in expressing themselves in a more unabashed manner.

26:12.760 --> 26:16.280
Nonetheless, I think some of these creators listened to a bit too much Ice Cube and drew

26:16.280 --> 26:20.760
the conclusion that a black person, exclaiming the N-word on a rap track, gave them license to start

26:20.760 --> 26:25.640
directing their decently sized platforms towards other creators, and barraging them with a slew of

26:25.640 --> 26:31.160
pretty relentless content, fortified by slurs that they felt more comfortable firing off due to their

26:31.160 --> 26:35.400
identity. This wasn't exclusive to Blair, Theron, for example, was another person who engaged in

26:35.400 --> 26:40.040
similar antics. However, the fact that many of these comments or insults were often used

26:40.040 --> 26:44.680
in an exclusionary or alienating fashion against people who may have personal history with those

26:44.680 --> 26:46.760
words didn't really justify it.

26:46.760 --> 26:52.360
So Kat Blaque's a YouTuber who's about as balls deep in Tumblr's social justice as one could possibly get,

26:52.360 --> 26:54.360
and balls deep is appropriate because she's a traitor.

26:54.360 --> 26:59.800
100% comedy from Blair White over here, you can tell that she would have surely become a stand-up

26:59.800 --> 27:04.120
if she had not pursued political commentary, but in a way where some may dismiss this as pointless

27:04.120 --> 27:08.440
edginess, critics would often see it as part of a greater ruse, which would be observed in other

27:08.520 --> 27:13.240
videos, with one garnering particular personal heat from myself. Yes, after making multiple response

27:13.240 --> 27:18.120
videos to content that our queen had decreed as cringe, it seems that Miss White had her finger on

27:18.120 --> 27:20.520
the pulse of so many of those around her.

27:20.520 --> 27:26.120
So today I want to talk about why people don't like trans people. I've received thousands upon thousands of

27:26.120 --> 27:31.080
emails, comments, messages from people saying that before finding my channel, they had absolutely

27:31.080 --> 27:35.560
no understanding of trans people, and that they were shocked to find a trans person who was actually

27:35.640 --> 27:36.120
sane.

27:36.120 --> 27:41.000
In this lovely upload, once again amended to have a more restrained headline, she decides to discuss

27:41.000 --> 27:45.400
exactly what the public's problems are with the transgender community, firstly mentioning about her

27:45.400 --> 27:50.360
experiences with many people who previously weren't aware of the existence of sane transgender people,

27:50.360 --> 27:53.480
until they encountered the wonders of Blair White.

27:53.480 --> 27:57.800
Because let's just face it, the majority of the ideas and policies and things that come out of the

27:57.800 --> 28:03.080
trans community and the activists that they prop up to speak for them in the public sphere are insane.

28:03.160 --> 28:08.360
I mean, I personally sometimes feel like I'm just drowning in this huge crowd of people who are screaming

28:08.360 --> 28:14.200
and crying about 97 genders, and I'm just in the back like... I'm not one of them.

28:14.200 --> 28:18.440
The transgender community then becomes this buzzword, and Blair once more sets herself apart,

28:18.440 --> 28:23.480
affirming her opposition to Bill C-16, for example, the controversial Canadian one that saw the rise of

28:23.480 --> 28:28.360
Jordan Peterson, and in this she also calls out the transgender community on other incidents, such as

28:28.360 --> 28:33.000
one where trans activists were allegedly pressuring the midwife community into using gender neutral

28:33.000 --> 28:37.720
terminology, referencing an Infowars article, which could have used a little research in itself,

28:37.720 --> 28:42.120
because most evidence appears to imply that there was little to no evidence of any pressure being

28:42.120 --> 28:47.080
applied at all, but okay, that's one reference, we'll put that aside for now, her point is clear

28:47.080 --> 28:48.040
enough regardless.

28:48.040 --> 28:53.320
But I'm sorry, like I said, acceptance is a two-way street, and behaving like insufferable children who

28:53.320 --> 28:57.800
place emotion-based arguments over fact-based arguments is not a way to get anything done.

28:58.600 --> 29:05.320
There was a moment in time where Blair White just wanted to grill, but that was no longer an option,

29:05.320 --> 29:09.800
and in taking a stand against these trans activists who were making all these unreasonable demands of

29:09.800 --> 29:14.600
society, she was proving that transgender people weren't this monolith that many had previously

29:14.600 --> 29:19.480
assumed them to be, but was anyone ever saying this, and was Blair's narrative really as

29:19.480 --> 29:21.080
altruistic as it appeared to be?

29:28.360 --> 29:45.240
Instead of arguing for the validity of transgenderism on a neurological or physiological level, you guys

29:45.240 --> 29:51.320
instead give up and start screaming and crying about how there's 97 genders, it's like, calm down,

29:51.320 --> 29:52.120
calm it down.

29:52.120 --> 29:56.440
The examples covered in my previous part may have found Blair approaching the aspects of trans issues

29:56.440 --> 30:00.360
from different angles, but they all seem to transport me back to the school playground in a way,

30:00.360 --> 30:01.720
and I'll explain why in a moment.

30:01.720 --> 30:05.720
The channel was always a very personal venture, and this upload was no exception, because although she

30:05.720 --> 30:10.680
proclaims that she is attempting to decipher the issue from within the community, she mostly uses it

30:10.680 --> 30:15.240
as a springboard to pat herself on the back, and tell people who aren't like her to calm down.

30:15.240 --> 30:21.160
And need I remind you that America, and western civilization in general, is the pinnacle of safety and

30:21.160 --> 30:26.120
freedom for trans people, and by the way, that statement is actually true for every group of people

30:26.120 --> 30:26.920
under the sun.

30:26.920 --> 30:31.560
As a trans person, you can't step foot in a single middle eastern country without fear of being

30:31.560 --> 30:35.240
jailed or worse, and the same goes for pretty much every African country.

30:35.240 --> 30:40.040
In America, you have access to transgender medical care, the ability to legally amend your gender,

30:40.040 --> 30:41.960
I can't see a relative probation, Blair.

30:41.960 --> 30:43.400
Basic bitch logic.

30:43.400 --> 30:43.960
Come on.

30:43.960 --> 30:50.520
Is that I think there's a lot more people out there who are opposed to the bat crazy ideas and policies

30:50.520 --> 30:55.320
that come out of the trans community and their activists, rather than trans people themselves.

30:55.320 --> 30:59.720
Because let's just face it, the majority of the ideas and policies and things that come out of the

30:59.720 --> 31:04.920
trans community and the activists that they prop up to speak for them in the public sphere are insane.

31:04.920 --> 31:09.400
I think it was tangible that at the time, people had received an impression of leftism, or at least

31:09.400 --> 31:13.000
certain branches of leftism due to chronicled attitudes of certain activists.

31:13.000 --> 31:17.320
However, to extend that logic to entire demographics and identity groups was ludicrous.

31:17.320 --> 31:21.800
All in all, it felt part of a greater narrative, which aside from being rather egotistical, like

31:21.800 --> 31:25.880
come on, you started your channel after appearing on stream with a transgender woman who espoused

31:25.880 --> 31:29.720
similar talking points at the time, it felt like an attempt to cater to people to win over their

31:29.720 --> 31:32.840
approval by being the quote, cool transgender person.

31:32.840 --> 31:38.040
This may be impudent for me to say, but it felt like the goal of 2016 Blair was her own acceptance,

31:38.040 --> 31:40.040
rather than acceptance of the greater community.

31:40.040 --> 31:44.120
On Twitter and YouTube, she would present herself as the emissary, but I don't think the opposite

31:44.120 --> 31:46.040
could have been more true in a way.

31:46.040 --> 31:50.200
It felt like a playground where she was trying to fit in with a certain clique by ostracising

31:50.200 --> 31:53.560
others, by proving that she was worthy, almost like initiation.

31:53.560 --> 31:58.280
In response to this, you could say that okay, the mainstream was a lot of the time the intolerant

31:58.280 --> 32:03.720
progressive lot, and maybe at her university it was, I'm happy to entertain that, but on YouTube

32:03.720 --> 32:08.360
it was a very different story, and once you take advantage of the power that you have to belittle

32:08.360 --> 32:13.000
others in your own domain, then you're no better than those you chastise so fervently.

32:13.000 --> 32:17.160
This can be embodied more than it is in the title, and once again, Blair had initially,

32:17.160 --> 32:22.040
and quite ironically, used a slur in presenting why some people just don't really like transgender

32:22.040 --> 32:26.520
individuals. Now, some transgender individuals may be okay or comfortable with that, but many aren't,

32:26.520 --> 32:31.880
and already addressing a group of people in such a way is going to breed division and provocation.

32:31.880 --> 32:35.880
Really, you could make the argument that Blair was validating using slurs in such a manner,

32:35.880 --> 32:40.520
that's only really going to win one side over and provoke the other, and when they are inevitably

32:40.520 --> 32:44.600
provoked, Blair will just tell them to calm down again and high five all her edgy friends.

32:45.240 --> 32:49.880
Having someone who set the bar so low for trans acceptance could make it easy for people to accept

32:49.880 --> 32:54.440
her, and reject other trans people who in many ways weren't making unbelievably preposterous

32:54.440 --> 32:57.800
demands from those around them, and you could make the argument that those people were never

32:57.800 --> 33:02.280
going to accept other transgender individuals regardless, and that Blair was at least making

33:02.280 --> 33:07.480
some level of acceptance somewhat accessible, maybe she provided a ramp into the transgender

33:07.480 --> 33:11.960
community. I think this would be a somewhat valid response on the surface, and that in many ways,

33:12.040 --> 33:16.440
Blair's position as a moderate could have been used to facilitate discourse between two separate

33:16.440 --> 33:20.840
camps, but this never fully materialised because she only aligned herself with the ideas of one of

33:20.840 --> 33:25.480
them, and Blair never really made an effort to facilitate acceptance of people, sometimes quite

33:25.480 --> 33:29.880
the opposite, in fact, because her own bar of acceptance was high and sometimes rather uneven,

33:29.880 --> 33:34.200
and would lead one to wonder what sort of environment her own principles would lead to.

33:34.200 --> 33:36.440
Case in point, the following situation.

33:36.440 --> 33:38.280
Would you date someone who's trans?

33:39.080 --> 33:39.720
No.

33:39.720 --> 33:41.000
Would you date someone who's black?

33:41.560 --> 33:42.280
Maybe.

33:42.280 --> 33:43.800
Would you date someone who's fat?

33:44.680 --> 33:45.180
No.

33:45.800 --> 33:47.960
Would you date someone who's disabled?

33:47.960 --> 33:48.440
No.

33:48.440 --> 33:52.120
One of the common recipients of Blair White's responses was a creator by the name of Riley

33:52.120 --> 33:56.200
Dennis. She was known for her takes at the time, which many found contentious, particularly given

33:56.200 --> 34:00.520
the era where she posted a preponderance of her political opinions in. I have to admit that I

34:00.520 --> 34:04.520
disagreed with a lot of what she had to say at the time, and I still probably wouldn't align with

34:04.520 --> 34:08.840
a fair proportion of what she said then today. However, disagreement is a healthy constituent

34:08.840 --> 34:12.920
of academic discourse, and the online sphere should be fertile ground to nurture productive

34:12.920 --> 34:17.400
discussion. However, Blair's demeanour towards Riley isn't what one would always characterise

34:17.400 --> 34:23.000
as, well, healthy. The first video released on Blair's thoughts on trans special people

34:23.000 --> 34:27.240
is a response to a now-deleted Riley Dennis video, which asserts that feminism isn't about

34:27.240 --> 34:32.200
hating men, amongst many other things. At this point, Riley was identifying as a non-binary

34:32.200 --> 34:36.600
trans woman. However, throughout the video, Blair refers to Riley as a he for reasons that

34:36.600 --> 34:40.840
are not explicitly clarified, but one can assume are in line with those expressed in the upload

34:40.840 --> 34:46.120
prior. I can't believe it's 2016 and we still have to talk about this. Okay, right off the bat,

34:46.120 --> 34:53.160
he's using the current year as an argument. In another video where she contends Riley's

34:53.160 --> 34:57.400
assertion that misgendering is violence, Blair generally avoids referring to Riley under any

34:57.400 --> 35:02.040
pronouns whatsoever, an option she probably thought was decidedly smarter given the topic.

35:02.040 --> 35:05.960
After concluding that misgendering is not violence but still a dick move, she takes the time to

35:05.960 --> 35:10.280
express her feelings on the matter of Riley's gender. And Riley, you seem to be really upset

35:10.280 --> 35:14.920
that people don't refer to you as she everywhere you go, but can you really blame them? Like,

35:14.920 --> 35:19.320
honestly, you call yourself a woman and a trans woman, but you actively talk about how you won't

35:19.320 --> 35:24.120
take hormones, and hormone therapy and surgery in some cases are what's actually going to give you

35:24.120 --> 35:28.680
those secondary sex characteristics that allow people to visually perceive you as a woman,

35:29.560 --> 35:35.000
Now, her statements on what Riley said are completely false, but we'll cross that bridge soon,

35:35.000 --> 35:39.880
we have other antics to address first. In tweets around this time, Blair was still taking more than

35:39.880 --> 35:45.000
enough liberties on labelling Riley under male pronouns, once more reaffirming her sentiments

35:45.000 --> 35:49.720
on the transition, and proudly undermining any neutrality conveyed in that YouTube video,

35:49.720 --> 35:53.800
and a couple months later, Blair returned back to using male pronouns in her upload.

35:54.280 --> 35:59.480
In spite of this, Blair had also still used a heralded transgender slur in titles referring

35:59.480 --> 36:04.120
to Riley's uploads, which I find surprising if you didn't actually believe Riley to be transgender,

36:04.120 --> 36:08.520
really having your cake and eating it there. I have to say that I found what was flip-flopping

36:08.520 --> 36:12.600
at best, and straight up self-contradiction at worst, and some other things as well,

36:12.600 --> 36:17.560
rather confusing. Is this what bridging the gap looks like? Well, maybe that's not what it

36:17.560 --> 36:22.440
appears, maybe over time Blair worked up this theory in her head regarding Riley, and in an

36:22.440 --> 36:27.240
upload posted to YouTube on June the 18th 2017, her theories come to the forefront of the

36:27.240 --> 36:31.320
commentary, with multiple backhanded comments about Blair's thoughts on the severity of Riley's

36:31.320 --> 36:33.560
gender identity. What were these thoughts?

36:33.560 --> 36:38.200
Riley, I know you're having trouble with this whole transition thing, mainly that you haven't

36:38.200 --> 36:43.400
done it. You know, if you went on estrogen, your sex drive wouldn't be so high, and you wouldn't

36:43.400 --> 36:48.040
be guilt tripping people into having sex with you. Just saying. But if anyone calls you a white

36:48.040 --> 36:52.280
supremacist, you deny it. If anyone accuses you of guilt tripping lesbians into sucking your dick,

36:52.280 --> 36:53.800
by saying you're trans, deny it.

36:53.800 --> 36:58.760
Blair's suspicions were very clear. Riley's existence as a trans person was merely political

36:58.760 --> 37:02.600
and self-serving, and that in time this would be revealed, as she wouldn't follow through on her

37:02.600 --> 37:08.120
transitioning properly. Why won't Riley take the estrogen, and what would it tell us about her?

37:08.680 --> 37:10.440
Ooh, well...

37:10.440 --> 37:15.800
Hey everybody, so today, the day this video is going live, I'm going to be on my way to

37:15.800 --> 37:20.440
San Francisco in preparation for my facial feminization surgery, or FFS for short.

37:20.440 --> 37:24.200
Somebody was about to have their well-deliberated theory swiftly debunked,

37:24.200 --> 37:28.120
leaving us to wonder if these playground hijinks were really worthwhile.

37:28.120 --> 37:49.800
...

37:49.800 --> 37:56.040
Several large YouTubers have been peddling the myth that I'm not really trans for well over a year

37:56.040 --> 38:01.000
now. They say I'm not a true trans because they claim I'm not taking any steps to transition,

38:01.000 --> 38:03.080
like not taking hormones and not having surgery.

38:03.080 --> 38:08.680
On June the 26th, 2017, Riley Dennis would upload a video, basically expressing what I would say

38:08.680 --> 38:12.520
to the theories advocated by Blair and others in the community around this time,

38:12.520 --> 38:16.760
that it's none of their f***ing business, and that her status as a trans person shouldn't depend on

38:16.760 --> 38:18.520
what procedures she's embarking on.

38:19.160 --> 38:24.120
These people who vehemently hate me, and make videos misgendering me, and insulting me,

38:24.120 --> 38:28.840
and making assumptions about my personal life, they feel entitled to information about my

38:28.840 --> 38:32.040
personal life, but I don't owe them that. I don't owe anyone that.

38:32.040 --> 38:35.800
What happens in my personal life is nobody's business but my own.

38:35.800 --> 38:40.280
What medications I take, what surgeries I have, what steps I take to transition,

38:40.280 --> 38:43.880
all of that is my business, and nobody else is entitled to that.

38:43.880 --> 38:46.600
Especially not strangers on the internet.

38:46.600 --> 38:50.920
I have every right to keep all of that information to myself.

38:50.920 --> 38:54.360
Being trans is not defined by hormones or surgery.

38:54.360 --> 38:57.320
Surgeries and hormones do not change your gender identity.

38:57.320 --> 39:00.680
External things like that do not affect your internal sense of gender.

39:00.680 --> 39:02.280
Which is what being trans is.

39:02.280 --> 39:06.520
So I don't want this to come across as me trying to prove that I'm a good trans now.

39:06.520 --> 39:10.200
I will be just as trans after FFS as I was before FFS.

39:10.200 --> 39:13.720
And I refuse to throw other trans people under the bus just because they don't take

39:13.720 --> 39:15.960
hormones or haven't had surgery or don't pass.

39:15.960 --> 39:20.360
Because I think that's a really gross way of gatekeeping who's allowed in the trans community.

39:20.440 --> 39:24.120
However, it doesn't stop there because Riley also reveals that she will be actively

39:24.120 --> 39:27.240
undergoing facial feminization surgery in the next few weeks,

39:27.240 --> 39:31.000
and had already been receiving hormone replacement therapy for almost a year,

39:31.000 --> 39:33.640
leaving those like Blair who had been chastised and Riley

39:33.640 --> 39:37.640
pretty ferociously in the public sphere, and all these theories out to dry.

39:37.640 --> 39:40.440
I'll add that our progressive friend here didn't come unprepared,

39:40.440 --> 39:44.520
dropping an ample sum of receipts to reinforce just how unsubstantiated

39:44.520 --> 39:47.000
many of these claims made about her identity were.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.680
All these claims by other YouTubers that I haven't been on hormones were just

39:50.680 --> 39:54.200
completely fabricated lies not based on anything I've ever said.

39:54.200 --> 39:57.160
In fact, a couple months ago, I got really worried about this.

39:57.160 --> 40:00.120
I knew that I hadn't talked about hormones since I had started them,

40:00.120 --> 40:03.080
but I thought maybe I had said something before that?

40:03.080 --> 40:07.320
So I searched through my Twitter timeline for any mentions of hormones or HRT,

40:07.320 --> 40:11.240
and I only found two tweets where I talked about hormones in relation to myself.

40:11.240 --> 40:15.880
One was from over a year ago, and I said I was planning on starting hormones as soon

40:15.880 --> 40:19.560
as I moved back to the US. The second one was also from over a year ago,

40:19.560 --> 40:22.680
and it was me saying that I was planning to start HRT soon.

40:22.680 --> 40:27.320
That's it. Those are the only times I've ever tweeted about hormones or HRT in relation to

40:27.320 --> 40:31.480
myself, and I was literally saying that I was planning to take hormones.

40:31.480 --> 40:35.320
Anybody who took half a second to search through my Twitter could have found this information.

40:35.320 --> 40:41.240
So I think I'm going to be starting hormones. I don't know about surgeries or anything like that

40:41.240 --> 40:45.400
yet. It's all kind of up in the air for me. But I have proof from YouTube and Twitter that

40:45.400 --> 40:49.960
I'm right, and they're wrong. They've been maliciously and intentionally spreading lies about me.

40:49.960 --> 40:53.320
Obviously, at approximately half an hour in total, there's a little more discussed than what I've

40:53.320 --> 40:57.720
spoken about now, but as a scaling clap back to many of the conspiracists, the video served its

40:57.720 --> 41:02.200
purpose, placing the ball quite squarely back into Blair's court. Now, as Riley had indicated,

41:02.200 --> 41:06.520
Blair wasn't the sole proponent of this narrative. However, as a reasonably sized creator and a

41:06.520 --> 41:10.920
transgender woman herself, it was pretty imperative that this little blunder be addressed.

41:10.920 --> 41:16.600
So on June the 29th, three days after Riley's shocking revelations, Blair uploads,

41:16.600 --> 41:18.040
I'm sorry.

41:18.040 --> 41:24.680
Okay, so this is a video that I really did not expect to ever make, ever, but those are always the most

41:24.680 --> 41:25.720
interesting ones, right?

41:25.720 --> 41:30.120
In this video, Blair takes responsibility for advancing the narrative that Riley was what many at the

41:30.120 --> 41:35.640
time regarded as a trans-trender, the political leeches. However, she also expands on the reasoning

41:35.640 --> 41:39.720
for what led her to such a conclusion, which I personally find a little dubious.

41:39.720 --> 41:43.880
One of the biggest things that I took issue with was that I assumed that Riley was taking on

41:43.880 --> 41:50.440
a transgender identity and label for political purposes, a trans-trender. Now, I had a lot of

41:50.440 --> 41:55.560
reasons to believe this. The first being statements from Riley about growing up and never questioning

41:56.200 --> 42:02.040
their gender. As a trans person myself, that's very weird to hear, because growing up, my earliest

42:02.040 --> 42:07.480
memories in life were that of questioning my gender and of questioning the gender role that I

42:07.480 --> 42:12.920
was expected to fill. So, as a trans person, I couldn't get in the headspace of what? How did you

42:12.920 --> 42:18.360
never question it? Another example is Riley's statements that trans people don't always want to

42:18.360 --> 42:23.960
transition. And again, as a trans person who's known many trans people, I couldn't wrap my head

42:23.960 --> 42:30.360
around that because, for me, the transition was incredibly paramount. It was the key to me living

42:30.360 --> 42:34.520
the fulfilled life that I live now. I was also under the assumption, as hundreds of thousands

42:34.600 --> 42:40.760
of other people were, that Riley had no desire to transition and that Riley was not transitioning,

42:40.760 --> 42:44.920
that Riley was just taking on the label of trans with no real action behind it.

42:44.920 --> 42:49.880
In retrospect, it's easy to say these justifications seem rather flimsy. Anyone may grow up without

42:49.880 --> 42:54.280
questioning certain aspects of their identity, particularly in certain environments, and to doubt

42:54.280 --> 42:58.840
the veracity of a person's gender because they have the courage to admit that seems extremely

42:58.840 --> 43:03.320
cynical. And Blair's other reason basically being that she went along with the mass consensus is

43:03.320 --> 43:07.960
barely a reason at all. Nonetheless, she had to explain her rationale whether it made sense or

43:07.960 --> 43:12.040
not. If that was the impression she received, then so be it. And once that was out of the way,

43:12.040 --> 43:15.800
she cut to the chase. And to be fair, her reflection is pretty strong and suitably

43:15.800 --> 43:22.040
self-critical. But the incessant push to prove that Riley was not trans and just realizing

43:22.840 --> 43:26.920
was probably really hurtful. And I'm aware that there's no way I would have known before the

43:26.920 --> 43:31.960
video where Riley actually discloses this information, but I feel like I was still in

43:31.960 --> 43:36.280
the wrong for trying to assume what was in someone's heart and mind when there was just

43:36.280 --> 43:41.080
simply no way I could have known. And make no mistake, it should have been. In many ways,

43:41.080 --> 43:45.640
it was starting to sink in that there was a toxicity in this online community that she was

43:45.640 --> 43:50.040
contributing to. Beyond just the narratives of making assumptions about transgender individuals

43:50.040 --> 43:53.400
deciding who is truly trans or not, there are other statements she had made. For example,

43:53.400 --> 43:59.000
this one towards fellow trans woman Steph Sanjati in 2016. When Steph tagged another trans woman to

43:59.000 --> 44:03.640
ask why Blair has to attack their appearance when she clearly has no clue what she's doing,

44:03.640 --> 44:07.720
Blair decides to jump in on the statement to inform Steph that she looks like a linebacker,

44:07.720 --> 44:12.840
is so extra and unnecessary. In this specific case, I think Blair misconstrued Steph's comment

44:12.840 --> 44:16.920
as an attack on her appearance rather than just going out of her way to offend, but it was

44:16.920 --> 44:22.360
indicative of how antagonistic she had become, how skeptical her own perception towards many of

44:22.360 --> 44:27.000
those she shared experiences with was. A much worse situation included her making a rather

44:27.000 --> 44:31.400
mean-spirited comment in response to a video by a person who was posting about her own experiences,

44:31.400 --> 44:34.520
once again, going at her ability to pass as a woman.

44:35.400 --> 44:39.320
So one thing has become pretty apparent since starting my YouTube channel, and that is that the

44:39.320 --> 44:44.600
trans community hates me. Throughout her time on YouTube, she had made a deal about being the

44:44.600 --> 44:49.480
public enemy of many of these trans women, how they hated her, how some couldn't be as good looking,

44:49.480 --> 44:53.400
how they weren't as pretty, and beyond all the complex theories that could arise as to why she

44:53.400 --> 44:57.960
did this, it was simply rather catty behavior. As her platform grew, having such demeanor that

44:57.960 --> 45:01.720
could influence the actions of viewers, particularly towards the subjects of her videos,

45:01.720 --> 45:06.440
some of whom transgender, this could easily cause unintended grief, and Blair wouldn't want that,

45:06.440 --> 45:10.360
especially as someone who had experienced that personally. With reference to the video about

45:10.360 --> 45:14.520
misgendering, she was at risk of becoming everything she had criticized in the past.

45:14.520 --> 45:19.880
At the end of the day, personal ideology transcends identity, so singling transgender people out in the

45:19.880 --> 45:23.480
way that Blair did on the basis of political disagreements alone wasn't really the most

45:23.480 --> 45:25.000
salubrious for either party.

45:25.000 --> 45:30.600
And I'm someone who's had my transition picked apart online. There have been Reddit threads

45:30.600 --> 45:35.160
and 4chan threads with hundreds of comments on it of people trying to prove that I'm not trans

45:35.160 --> 45:40.920
because I haven't done this or that, or, you know, digging up my old pictures, and, you know,

45:43.000 --> 45:47.400
I'm a strong person, I'm a happy person, but to sit here and pretend like it doesn't affect me

45:47.400 --> 45:54.520
at all would just be a lie. So the thought that this entire time I've done that exact same thing

45:55.160 --> 46:02.280
to someone else, and pushed that off on someone else, f*** with me, and I'm f***ing sorry.

46:02.280 --> 46:05.720
Now, I think there were some who probably doubted the sincerity of this apology.

46:05.720 --> 46:09.560
At the end of the day, this was an narrative maintained over a year by an individual who,

46:09.560 --> 46:13.160
given her own self-admitted personal experiences, should have known better,

46:13.160 --> 46:16.840
have at the same time as a person who did have some authority within the community,

46:16.840 --> 46:20.840
speaking out on the matter would at least cause some to listen to her who may not otherwise

46:20.840 --> 46:25.960
relented. Maybe the growth and the community she was in had taken her on a bit of a power trip,

46:25.960 --> 46:28.680
and this was the warranted yank back down to earth she needed.

46:28.680 --> 46:34.840
You know, this whole thing has really taught me a lesson that I should really try to stick to ideas,

46:34.840 --> 46:42.200
opinions, policy, rather than, like, trying to get in someone's head and, like, make judgments

46:42.200 --> 46:47.080
about something that's so personal and so nuanced.

46:47.080 --> 46:51.320
To many, this appeared to be a turning point in Blair's content, as she committed to making

46:51.320 --> 46:56.120
her videos more focused on their political roots, and gravitating away from the petty remarks and

46:56.120 --> 47:00.520
character judgments that had landed her in hot water this time. Whether Riley accepted it herself

47:00.520 --> 47:04.360
we'll never know, though she did upload a video just over a month later discussing how to make

47:04.360 --> 47:08.600
a good apology video. Although not mentioning Blair's video at any point, and using a different

47:08.600 --> 47:12.920
example completely to illuminate her thesis, it was a bit coincidental for some, and seemingly

47:12.920 --> 47:17.480
reignited the feud between the two creators, even causing the video to be temporarily taken down

47:17.480 --> 47:22.520
in the process due to flagging. Fantastic. But deep breaths, Blair still had a new leaf to turn over,

47:22.520 --> 47:26.920
we were going to talk about political content, and a bit of a Twitter spat between old nemeses

47:26.920 --> 47:31.480
isn't substantial enough to say that she had returned to old habits, no. As the content went,

47:31.480 --> 47:36.280
it looked like there was a new direction for Blair, and to be honest, maybe it was the fresh start

47:36.280 --> 47:36.920
she needed.

47:41.560 --> 47:46.520
I'm going to open this part by at least defending Blair White to a certain degree, I know, I even

47:46.520 --> 47:51.400
surprise myself sometimes. As much as I have detailed aspects of her channel, and her behaviour

47:51.400 --> 47:55.640
in a pretty critical light, it's important to recognise the zeitgeist, and how that may have

47:55.640 --> 48:00.040
influenced her comportment. I know that to many people, even myself, that it may have seemed like

48:00.040 --> 48:04.360
she was pandering to seek approval from the online crowd, but throughout that period, and even up to

48:04.360 --> 48:08.680
this day, one of the prevalent narratives espoused by individuals from within this realm was that

48:08.680 --> 48:13.960
these ideas were the counterculture. This was a pushback against the mainstream ideologies enforced

48:13.960 --> 48:19.160
by oppressive neoterics who didn't even want to allow room for discussion. Blair had been there

48:19.160 --> 48:24.200
herself, she'd set foot in the liberal university campuses, and encountered that environment first

48:24.200 --> 48:29.560
hand. That edginess that some wanted to shut down was part of that movement, it was greater back

48:29.560 --> 48:34.040
then. In her own mind, Blair may have felt she was the one fighting back by saying what she said,

48:34.040 --> 48:38.120
she was joining the resistance, and this attitude that she adopted was part of that movement. That

48:38.120 --> 48:42.920
she wasn't pandering, she was adapting, and many other people did the same. Channels from all genres

48:42.920 --> 48:46.760
probably said stuff they would never be caught saying to date, many commentators being no

48:46.760 --> 48:51.320
exception. Here, the idea lingered that maybe some of Blair's antics were in part a product of their

48:51.320 --> 48:55.480
era, like some of the other creators who had also been in that position as well, and had since

48:55.480 --> 49:00.120
reformed themselves. How this would only be answered by a content, and how it would develop in relation

49:00.120 --> 49:04.600
to the evolving YouTube ecosystem. With the observed incident grounding her, this would definitely

49:04.600 --> 49:06.600
be a chance to realign those values.

49:06.600 --> 49:11.720
I'm not infallible, I've definitely, you know, over the course of doing political commentary for the

49:11.720 --> 49:16.520
past almost two years, I know I've probably said things that are not true, thinking they were true,

49:16.520 --> 49:22.680
I've definitely accidentally spread fake news, and I'm definitely not calling myself a fact machine.

49:22.680 --> 49:27.800
2017 was an interesting time, in my opinion, it was when the pushback against presiding

49:27.800 --> 49:31.320
anti-SJW narratives on YouTube began to gather momentum,

49:31.320 --> 49:37.560
and the science says we're all on a spectrum, um, no, um,

49:43.000 --> 49:46.760
this didn't necessarily quell the strength of certain commentators, but it definitely meant that

49:46.760 --> 49:50.680
a lot of discourse appeared to grow more balanced, with certain perspectives no longer going

49:50.680 --> 49:55.960
unchallenged. Alongside this, with certain US policy in particular skewing in concerning directions,

49:55.960 --> 50:00.440
it became more difficult for some to argue that conservatism was this oppressed political

50:00.440 --> 50:05.000
underdog. However, there was never an absence of content to tune online, for a creator of any

50:05.000 --> 50:10.360
leading, and Blair was never starved for content. Blair never positioned herself as a disillusioned

50:10.360 --> 50:14.440
liberal like some of her colleagues, she was a conservative, and rather proud of the fact.

50:14.440 --> 50:19.240
Nonetheless, there were a few key issues that she liked to weigh in on, ones that didn't necessarily

50:19.240 --> 50:24.200
fall too clearly on a liberal-conservative spectrum, more coming down to questions of common sense,

50:24.200 --> 50:28.280
and in the months following her apology to Riley Dennis, she appeared to readjust her trajectory,

50:28.280 --> 50:31.880
to present a more balanced perspective on political affairs that would reflect the current

50:31.880 --> 50:37.480
landscape. According to police reports, and not sensationalized headlines, this occurred in a

50:37.480 --> 50:42.440
private residence, in an apartment, and it just happened to have occurred in a bathroom, and the

50:42.440 --> 50:47.720
person was a family friend. It was not stranger danger, it was not stranger trannies in the

50:47.720 --> 50:53.720
bathroom gonna get you danger, it just wasn't. Ian Miles Chong claimed straight up that it happened

50:53.720 --> 50:58.120
in a public bathroom. For example, this video corrects misinformation surrounding a transgender

50:58.120 --> 51:02.280
individual convicted of sexual assault, and the factually incorrect claims made by someone on the

51:02.280 --> 51:06.840
right that this had occurred in a public restroom. Or we could talk about the upload at the start of

51:06.840 --> 51:11.000
2018, where she reacted to some of her older content that she no longer associates with,

51:11.000 --> 51:15.320
and although still being somewhat mitigated in her self-criticism, still demonstrates awareness

51:15.320 --> 51:19.320
of her errors. So there's been a bunch of pictures and videos that have come out that have led people

51:19.320 --> 51:24.040
to believe that she has some sort of neurological disorder, or, you know, she's generally just

51:24.040 --> 51:27.880
unfit to be president because she's ill. By the way, I still think Hillary Clinton is

51:27.880 --> 51:32.760
actually the devil, but I regret doing this video. She may have very well been sick,

51:32.760 --> 51:39.160
but the evidence I used in this video is reaching at best. It's so flimsy, it's so weak,

51:39.720 --> 51:44.680
and I'm surprised more people didn't call me out on it, honestly. All of these examples show growth

51:44.680 --> 51:48.840
from previous incidents, hopefully allowing her to move towards being a more recent and

51:48.840 --> 51:53.080
independent voice within the community. Throughout this period, Blair also seemed to pivot back

51:53.080 --> 51:57.320
towards more introspective videos that spoke about her personal life and development in her

51:57.320 --> 52:01.480
transition. There was a fair bit that warranted praise, and I don't want to understate that.

52:01.480 --> 52:05.240
At the same time, there were still signs that aspects of her content indulged perspectives

52:05.240 --> 52:10.120
without being fully transparent in the delivery of that information, such as the Trump hat in

52:10.120 --> 52:11.080
Hollywood video.

52:11.080 --> 52:15.640
Hey guys, so today is a bit of a different kind of video. We're doing a social experiment video.

52:15.640 --> 52:21.080
You guys know I've been doing on the street stuff, and Joey and I had this sick idea of walking

52:21.080 --> 52:27.160
around West Hollywood, which is the gay area of Hollywood, and just, you know, wearing a little

52:28.120 --> 52:29.960
hat that we think people would be really upset about.

52:29.960 --> 52:41.560
Now, on the surface, this is a standard intolerant left video, and obviously, when witnessing violence

52:41.560 --> 52:45.960
against someone, many would feel naturally shocked. In the description, a disclaimer sits informing

52:45.960 --> 52:50.280
viewers that Blair and her partner did not act in any way that would have provoked the attacks,

52:50.280 --> 52:54.520
implying the hats were the only variable of interest here. This caught the eye of many on

52:54.520 --> 52:59.480
social media given its content, and led to some circulation and interest from those outside her

52:59.560 --> 53:04.200
typical audience. Nonetheless, this also reached the fact checking website Snopeskin, who contacted

53:04.200 --> 53:07.880
the Los Angeles Police Department, and were informed that Blair and her husband had crossed the

53:07.880 --> 53:13.000
dividing line set up specifically to prevent any physical altercation. Now, does this justify the

53:13.000 --> 53:17.800
behavior of those depicted in the video? No, but at the same time, it's hardly wearing a Trump hat

53:17.800 --> 53:22.840
in Hollywood, moreover, wearing it to an anti-Trump protest. I'll add the caveat that she does have a

53:22.840 --> 53:26.840
drink thrown in her face at the end of the video, which, although Snopes cast suspicion on comparing

53:26.840 --> 53:30.840
her to Alex Jones, I don't really think it's completely fair, and could well have happened.

53:30.840 --> 53:34.280
At the same time, given the framing, doubt is obviously going to be inevitable, and given how

53:34.280 --> 53:38.840
heavily edited the video is, it's hard to arbitrate exactly what happened, but maybe that's just

53:38.840 --> 53:42.840
clickbait for you. Nonetheless, certain concerns, however, go beyond a single video.

53:43.720 --> 53:50.920
You know, these other beasts, let me not say beasts, but these other people who are pressuring

53:50.920 --> 53:55.400
people to be with them, it's growth. Yes, I'd say there are still comments present that showcased

53:55.400 --> 54:00.280
her rather flippant nature and desire to one-up those she viewed unfavorably, but these were asides

54:00.280 --> 54:05.480
and a far cry from what she had perpetuated in the past. We can all be divas from time to time,

54:05.480 --> 54:06.200
can't we?

54:06.200 --> 54:10.600
I mean, let's be honest, most of the people who complain about this kind of thing are the worst

54:10.600 --> 54:15.960
people, the most undateable, cringy, miserable individuals, just very tacky.

54:15.960 --> 54:20.440
Well, I don't know, but as we move further into 2018, she seemed to distance herself more and more

54:20.440 --> 54:24.200
from the political community that she had previously shared propriety with. Her content

54:24.200 --> 54:27.800
gravitated towards topics that felt more vlog-oriented in a way, and this inevitably

54:27.800 --> 54:31.960
yielded some questions from viewers who were familiar with her more outspoken self. Although

54:31.960 --> 54:36.280
I think many were expecting a new direction, this certainly was a different flavour. Eventually,

54:36.280 --> 54:40.440
she'd upload a video explaining exactly why she'd done this, and the reasons behind it,

54:40.440 --> 54:43.560
and to be fair to her, many of them seemed quite justified and believable.

54:44.200 --> 54:48.760
So the simplest answer as to why I've steered away from politics, at least recently, and at least for

54:48.760 --> 54:54.760
now, maybe not forever, is that quite frankly, I guess just the best way to put it is politics,

54:55.400 --> 55:03.240
and political commentary specifically, has effed up my life. The FBI incidents, the going out in

55:03.240 --> 55:08.360
public and having people try to fight me, the doxing, the stalking, the people entering my

55:08.360 --> 55:15.480
building, all that kind of stuff, my family being harassed, and you know, I am at such a place where

55:15.480 --> 55:22.600
I feel like, has it been worth it? I moved to LA almost a year ago, and one thing about LA is

55:22.600 --> 55:28.120
there's a lot of work here, so a lot of other political commentators, other people who you guys

55:28.120 --> 55:32.040
know, I'm not talking about obscure people here, a lot of them either live in LA or they're

55:32.040 --> 55:38.200
constantly in and out for work, filming something, doing whatever they do, so I've met almost all of

55:38.200 --> 55:42.760
them. People have either been on their show, or on a show with them, or I went to a dinner with them,

55:42.760 --> 55:47.160
an event with them, or I became close with some of them. The amount of them that I've met that

55:47.160 --> 55:53.080
have told me either directly or in a roundabout way that's very clear, that they don't believe

55:53.080 --> 55:56.600
everything that they say that they believe when they're on camera, a lot of them just flat out

55:56.600 --> 56:03.000
don't believe, they're just actors. Grifters, threats, doctors, they're all plausible in such

56:03.000 --> 56:07.640
a polarizing community with such potential, and if you can't handle that, then it's understandable

56:07.640 --> 56:11.880
that you'd want to take a step back. It'd make anyone feel rather dirty once they've been exposed

56:11.880 --> 56:16.360
to it long enough, and the video itself feels like Blair finally washing her hands of such

56:16.360 --> 56:22.120
toxicity. This was the movement we needed. BLAIR It comes in such extremes, it's like something

56:22.120 --> 56:26.520
really amazing will happen, and I'll get like the coolest opportunity ever, but then something

56:26.520 --> 56:32.120
really effing terrible will happen, and it's these crazy highs and lows that I feel like are a lot

56:32.120 --> 56:37.960
more extreme than if I just did other types of content that make me equally as happy, you know?

56:38.600 --> 56:51.480
But were those hands as clean as they appeared?

56:55.480 --> 57:00.360
BLAIR That venting session was so necessary. When I say it was so necessary, it was so

57:01.400 --> 57:07.240
necessary. It felt amazing. The video about why Blair changed seemed pretty conclusive in the

57:07.240 --> 57:12.040
moment, rather scaling towards many aspects of the community and even the media beyond that,

57:12.040 --> 57:16.120
ending on a rather affirmative note that would cause many to assume that she was mostly finished

57:16.120 --> 57:29.880
with political content, at least for a while. However, it seems the contrary appeared to be the

57:29.880 --> 57:34.600
case. In fact, it looked as though Blair's open venting made her feel more reassured in returning

57:34.600 --> 57:38.920
topics that she had distanced herself from, and after a month interval, she returned to a schedule

57:38.920 --> 57:43.240
of more politically oriented content. I'm not entirely sure why, it's not like many of the

57:43.240 --> 57:48.120
concerns that she had outlined in her video could subside. In fact, you could argue her shedding

57:48.120 --> 57:52.200
light on them had only heightened the attention they could receive, but if that's how she felt,

57:52.200 --> 57:57.080
then that's her prerogative. BLAIR Hi, so I know I said in the last video that I wasn't gonna talk

57:57.080 --> 58:03.080
about politics anymore. That was a lie. I'm a liar, because women lie. Just kidding, that was

58:03.080 --> 58:08.840
a joke, and probably not fitting for this video, but… Well, I appreciate the honesty, Blair. Her

58:08.840 --> 58:13.080
first video back was a response to the slogan Believe All Women, a rather contentious phrase

58:13.080 --> 58:17.720
which some advocates claim has been unfairly conflated with the similar, though not identical,

58:17.720 --> 58:22.360
Believe Women. As you can probably assume, Blair's position on the slogan was unsurprisingly quite

58:22.360 --> 58:26.360
critical, though not necessarily making the distinction mentioned prior. Nevertheless,

58:26.360 --> 58:30.360
the video was well received, and she appeared to return to her routine schedule of content.

58:30.360 --> 58:34.600
This may have spiked some unease amongst those still skeptical of her intentions, especially

58:34.600 --> 58:40.040
considering some of the clickbait and chosen subjects, but hope may have been instilled as

58:40.040 --> 58:44.200
she appeared to stand by her reformed demeanor and refrain from shabby character attacks,

58:44.200 --> 58:48.440
even reconciling with one of the individuals she had previously been rather insensitive towards,

58:48.440 --> 58:53.160
and recognising her responsibility. So all in all, we could say there was progress made, correct?

58:53.800 --> 58:59.000
Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves, because again, as time elapsed, it felt like this was

58:59.000 --> 59:04.360
waning. So today I have one of the cringiest videos I have seen in a long time on the

59:04.360 --> 59:09.240
interweb. I mean, the content itself was still lightweight at best and a bit misleading at the

59:09.240 --> 59:13.800
worst. I know it's kind of Blair's style to not create the most demanded content, but conversely,

59:13.800 --> 59:18.040
I think there are videos which just end up failing rather in their portrayal of the source material,

59:18.040 --> 59:22.280
and once again fall back onto this idea of catering to a perspective. Now, obviously,

59:22.280 --> 59:26.520
anyone would be pleased that her content is less incendiary than it was before, but at the same

59:26.520 --> 59:30.920
time, having many prominent flaws and just subtracting the evident offensiveness previously

59:30.920 --> 59:36.120
present doesn't necessarily make it good. And make no mistake, there isn't a great divergence

59:36.120 --> 59:43.080
from precursory output. This video where she responds to a notoriously unpopular Teen Vogue

59:43.080 --> 59:55.080
upload. Now, there are certainly points in the original that could be disputed,

59:55.080 --> 59:58.040
but a load of Blair's arguments are pretty lazy, too.

59:58.040 --> 01:00:04.680
Blair- This idea that the body is either male or female is totally wrong, and I am living proof of

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:11.720
that. She literally just said that she's proof of that and didn't explain why. Like, it went on to

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:17.320
the next scene. Blair, she literally elaborates on this later on in the section. Blair- I identify

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:23.560
as an intersex woman. I have gone through surgeries that have really stuck with me through

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:29.960
my whole life and affected a lot of different parts of my life just so that I can fit into this box

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:35.240
of female. The video's over seven minutes long, and these segments are even shorter, so you'd need

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:39.960
to have a pretty short attention span to miss it. And as said, it's not an infallible upload,

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:45.000
but she skips over so much of it and responds to the parts where she can drop a sassy takedown

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.480
comment, some which doesn't even work in the greater context of the original video. Another

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:53.960
example would be the classic The Mob Tried To Cancel Me Again upload, where Blair is rather

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:59.240
angry that an event she was part of hosted by Walk Away, a prominent LGBT movement promoting

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:03.320
exodus of the Democratic Party, was moved last minute due to an open letter and accompanying

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:07.720
dossier published by online communities, documenting what they had deemed as behaviour

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:12.840
contrary to the values of the venue hosting the event. She initially scolded the LGBT Center for

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:17.160
their decision to refuse their guests, and all the fans they would inevitably put out of pocket with

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:21.160
the impending cancellation, a comment that some would deem slightly ironic given that she was

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:25.000
accused of doing the same one and a half years prior for a debate with their admirer and

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.720
contrapoints, another trans creator on the left of the spectrum whom she had debated previously.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:34.120
However, that was a while back, and so was a lot of what she had been accused of in this dossier,

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.520
so she took to YouTube to defend herself.

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:41.640
Today I am going to be addressing the mob, but more specifically, what I wanted to address in

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:47.000
this video is the petition that was sent to the LGBT Center from activists online to have me

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.120
deplatformed. The petition and what they were saying was absolutely just riddled with

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:58.040
misrepresentations, lies, exaggerations, and just bullshit about me. So we're going to go over some

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:02.600
pictures right now that people love to bring up when they're trying to ruin something for me.

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:07.640
People are claiming that that photo is me holding up a white supremacist hand signal. So to address

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:13.080
that specifically, so stupid I have to, this is again an okay hand signal. This is not a white

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:17.720
supremacist hand signal. In the video, however, Blair picks out two isolated examples from the

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:22.280
document in question, and even then somehow manages to take one of them out of context.

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:27.400
So here's another photo people love digging up from 2016, a photo of me apparently in blackface.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:32.520
This is all well and good, but she's omitted the caption, and this caption was present in the

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:37.240
document, so there's no real reason to do this otherwise unless you view it as strictly irrelevant

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:41.720
to the discourse, which I would find unlikely personally. Now, does this make the offense

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:46.440
terrible or even comparable to a lot of what is normally considered blackface? Not necessarily,

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:50.600
because if you donned it with the primary intent of being a beauty treatment, then that's important

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:55.000
information. However, it was still posted to social media as a reference to blackface,

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.240
and that is of interest, and Blair was aware of that. However, instead, we have to deal with the

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:03.800
incredulous tone and touch from the astounded commentator who puts all these bottom feeders

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:15.400
in their place. It's strange to me because it doesn't seem like a point that's impossible to

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:20.600
respond to in its full context, and yet it was still watered down. Even with this considered,

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:24.360
there's a lot of the document that Blair just doesn't respond to at all. Some of it I can

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:28.280
understand, she doesn't consider it a big deal. Other parts, well.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:52.840
When videos are like this, I just wonder why they're even made at all, and maybe that's what

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:57.160
I get for making videos as long as I do. Yet, it seemed for every step Blair took forward,

01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:00.840
they were offset by shortcomings that could have been alleviated if she'd been a bit more

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:05.000
meticulous or upfront in the material she presented, and that for someone who valued facts

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.640
and information so much, they could really be lacking sometimes, for the most pointless reasons

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:14.680
as well. It's hard to fully diagnose what was going on, because it never felt fully malicious,

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:18.440
just very lackluster, and I received the impression that maybe Blair was becoming

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:23.320
tired of her content, maybe she was on autopilot, maybe she needed a new calling.

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:27.160
Well, as we move deeper into 2019, it seems she may have found it.

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:42.120
So, I guess it's time to introduce a side character, this is an individual by the name of

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:46.520
Jessica Yaniv. She first hit the headlines in mid-2019 after filing multiple complaints with

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:51.000
the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal as she was refused Brazilian waxes by beauticians,

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.920
and seeking damages from each individual involved. She claimed this was discrimination

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:59.480
on the basis of her transgender identity, however, the defendants contested they were not comfortable

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:03.880
or experienced with her genitalia, which included a phallus. There's a lot that takes my interest

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:07.720
regarding this case that could be discussed in the future, but for now, all I'll say is that there

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:12.040
are many that understandably didn't sympathize with her plight, and questioned her intentions

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:15.880
in initiating these proceedings given certain details. Additionally, others following the

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:20.200
situation decided to dig further into her antics, discovering a consistent pattern of rather

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:25.240
inappropriate and predatory behaviour, provoking condemnation and backlash towards the controversial

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:29.720
figure. However, it appears there was another person with an eye on the debacle, Blair White.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:33.480
Now, Blair had perhaps signaled her intent to pursue a new direction a week before,

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:38.120
although once again not in the most graceful form, after she had confused a Twitter user by the name

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:42.760
of Princess Steph with a TikTok predator by the name of Mama Steph, in full-fledged serving the

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:47.000
wrong Chris Hansen style. She had deleted these tweets shortly after realising her error, though

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:52.120
I'm not ever sure if amends were made. Nonetheless, a good few days later, she probably felt on more

01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:56.840
sure-footing as she launched a pretty extensive attack on Yaniv, who she branded decisively in

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:59.000
her upload as the Trans-Predator.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:08.440
This week, this is trans activist Jessica Yaniv. Now, this person is the walking, talking, living and breathing

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:15.560
embodiment of what people fear when it comes to trans people. I do not believe this is a trans woman.

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:21.160
I believe this is a predator posing as a trans woman. Now, make no mistake, none of these messages

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:27.400
are how women talk to each other or trans women talk to women or anyone. Yaniv clearly has an

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:34.040
obsession with, you know, feminine products and women and girls, and it's incredibly disturbing,

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.720
and this needs to be called out.

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:40.120
The video delineates the evidence accumulated against Jessica, while also discussing the greater

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:44.680
impact on the trans community, and how the general public may regard it, lambasting the activists

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.360
who haven't spoken out.

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:52.120
"-This. Why are you silent when this type of thing comes up? This should be part of your job.

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:56.840
It should be part of your job as an activist who wants to apparently put trans people in a better

01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:02.600
light and better social standing. It is important for us to distance ourselves from this. I'm not

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:07.320
here to police what, you know, other trans public figures do with their social media and with their

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:13.080
platform, but they seem to complain about a lot of stuff, right? And I know they've seen this.

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:19.800
So maybe to those people, I would ask when you're writing, you know, your 17th tweet about how bad I

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:24.600
am, maybe use one tweet to be like, that's not us. This is horrible."

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:28.360
In many ways, these assertions don't feel out of place for a standard Blair White video,

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:32.360
but the narrative of exposing someone for such egregious behavior appeared to provide it with

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:37.240
greater moral foundations, attracting praise from a broad spectrum of viewers, and Craig galvanizing

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:41.560
her ratings and engagement like seldom before. And when a formula works, and you seem to be

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:44.520
enjoying it like Blair was, you pursue it a bit further.

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:50.440
I feel like this channel is becoming a predator hunter channel, and I'm actually 100% okay with it.

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:54.520
So a few more videos go up on the matter. A couple of these continue to follow the Yuneve saga,

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:58.760
including a blatant live stream in which both the participants clash heads pretty explosively.

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:02.520
They discuss a medley of subjects, with Blair occasionally just driving home the very

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:06.920
pertinent point of how much more attractive than Jessica she is, instead of merely calling Yuneve

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:08.200
out for her blatant bigotry.

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:36.520
Overall though, I think it does contain some interesting character indictments about Yuneve

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.000
so I won't complain too much on that front. However, some may begin to question this general

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.480
direction on the basis that Blair's content was portraying transgender individuals in a negative

01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:50.040
light. After all, what does a person's identity have to do with how they behave? Well, in another

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:54.440
video about an individual who Blair believed to be enacting sexual roleplay disguised as transgender

01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:57.000
activism, she appears to explain this justification.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:02.680
But what we don't need is people who are not even trans, enacting this predatory behaviour under the

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:08.120
guise of being trans, under the blanket, the protection of being trans, really. People like

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:14.440
Jessica Yuneve and people like Stephanie actually use the trans label as a protective force field

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:19.240
to stop people from criticising their predatory behaviour. It's not who they are, it is their

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:23.640
scapegoat. Similar to her Jessica Yuneve video, it's clear that she feels there are certain people

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:28.280
who are masquerading their rather sick depravity under the veil of the transgender label, and as a

01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:32.760
transgender person herself, Blair wants nothing to do with that, she wants to let people know that

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:37.160
such behaviour has no place in her community. I suppose it's an understandable sentiment when you

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:41.320
have an activist community who you want to set yourself apart from, but I think you also have to

01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:46.120
be wary that you avoid perpetuating the conflation yourself, that you're not just pouring fuel onto

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:50.600
the fire to then try and put it out. Blair seemed pretty pleased with this direction, even dropping

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:55.320
an Onision video in the process, who isn't trans as far as I know, how there were still

01:09:55.320 --> 01:10:00.040
a couple red flags that maybe she was a bit too emboldened by her newfound penchant for exposing

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:04.840
people. Blair and drag queens are brought into public libraries, elementary schools, preschools,

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:10.680
kindergartens, to read to children, and they come in drag, and it's supposed to be this thing that's

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:19.480
very mind-opening for children, it's just this super woke thing. So meet this man, Albert Garza,

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:24.920
drag queen performer, has performed numerous times at Drag Queen Story Hour to underage young

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:31.560
children, and what do you know, he's a convicted predator, but is somehow still allowed to read to

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:36.520
children as a drag queen. In this video, she decided to cover a predator who was participating

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:40.680
in the drag queen program, providing it with a title as endearing as ever. However, when

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:44.600
initially released, it had this thumbnail. What's the problem? Well, the problem is that this drag

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:49.080
queen in the thumbnail has nothing to do with any of the charges actually mentioned in the video.

01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:53.320
In fact, the only acknowledgement of this person is at the start, where they're once again so

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:57.560
tastefully placed alongside the news report of the actual offender's conviction.

01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:03.640
Bringing drag performers together with little kids is kind of a perfect relationship. I'm hoping what

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:11.960
the kids get out of coming to story time is an opportunity to see that things that are different

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:16.280
aren't scary. Relationships and gender identities and everything.

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:20.920
A revelation that a registered sex offender participated in a story time for children might

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:25.080
be surprising in and of itself. When called out for this, Blair did make the change relatively

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:29.240
quickly, but it does lead one to wonder how many times this can happen. I don't really like the

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:33.000
video much either. It felt like the reservoir for such content was already running dry,

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:39.080
especially given the fact that the video once again just sucks. And to make matters worse,

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:46.200
there's a library board in Wichita that can't seem to agree. They can't come to a clear consensus

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:52.600
on whether or not convicted child predators should be reading to their kids as drag queens.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:58.440
I'm not joking. It's a thing. This article states board members were split between those who said

01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:03.160
registered sex offenders should be automatically disqualified from ever giving a talk at the

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:12.120
library and those who said it should be allowable in some circumstances. What circumstances is it

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:18.680
okay for a predator to speak to kids? Blair, have you heard of scrolling down?

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:23.560
It's literally written there in the article. The exceptions that could be considered. You can

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:29.400
disagree or dispute them, but you can't act like they don't exist and get all hot and bothered when

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:37.960
they're right there. Talk about due diligence. Deep breaths. Focus. Focus. But what I am saying,

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:43.080
which is what something that LGBT advocates don't seem to ever get through their head,

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:49.320
is that sometimes you guys are so lax and so interested in being woke that you leave the

01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:56.920
door open for this. Stop. Like I hate to constantly get all think of the children on you,

01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:01.960
but think of the children. Okay. I have to admit that I'm feeling rather faint and

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:05.960
I need to sleep this frustration off.

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:35.560
Okay, let's regather myself. Where were we? Nobody likes predatory behavior. It can be pretty much

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:39.480
universally denounced, and Blair going after people who had acted in such a way was a gold

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:44.040
mine, whether always completely accurate in the assertions she made or not. However, it also

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:48.600
bestowed Blair with power that she'd previously not been accustomed with, this social gravitas,

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:53.400
a currency of credibility that extended beyond a political plea. This like complete change of heart,

01:13:53.400 --> 01:14:00.040
if in person you weren't so fake. I continue seeing how fraudulent they are and how gross of a

01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:07.000
community or genre of content that is. Um, it's starting to again affect my willingness to be

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.800
part of that community. And obviously all doesn't mean literally all. There's two or three good ones,

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:18.840
but the overwhelming majority and those people that you guys know are just liars.

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:23.080
Now, when she made the video about why she changed, it may not have served her channel

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:27.000
much purpose in the context of the political content that followed almost immediately after,

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000
but it did begin to cement a distancing from certain highly polarizing figures that,

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000
throughout much of the channel's early stages, she found herself rather congenial with. The

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:40.120
political community that was once rather tight knit in 2016 had definitely divided itself in the

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:45.480
years ensuing, to those who had become more amenable to leftism like Sean Head, for example,

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:49.800
and those who were still quite resistant to it. And this would only become more lucid as time

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:55.320
transpired. Both of them very much. I really do like both of them, but it's become obvious that

01:14:55.320 --> 01:15:01.720
Sean Head is becoming radicalized towards communism. And in fact, I, with my burner

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:05.480
accounts on Twitter, tweeted at her, look, dude, by the end of the year at this rate,

01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:09.960
you're going to be a communist. And she replied with never, and then deleted that tweet. And

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:18.600
all we see now is this radical cascade into what appears to be just full communism. And I'm just

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:23.400
staggered by it. Blair was no different in this sense, at least. 2016 Blair hung around with a

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:27.800
very different crew than her 2019 entourage. The strange detail in Blair's situation is that she

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:31.640
maintained a lot of her narratives that remain critical of communities that she'd always been

01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:35.880
outspoken about. However, pairing them with topics that expose predators appeared to win over a

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:39.640
larger audience and push her more into the mainstream. Finishing this saga off on the

01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:44.920
Onision video was a fitting end, especially given the apolitical nature of despising him. Hating

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:49.320
people who behave in such a manner transcends politics. And even if you don't agree with

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:53.560
Blair, a lot of people found it in themselves to look past their differences to support her

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:58.040
crusade. In a way, it's what finally made her mainstream, which is a pretty incredible feat,

01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:01.960
considering less than a few months ago she was lamenting cancellation of the walk away event

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:06.920
due to the antics of her and her peers, and her continued involvement with that movement since.

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:11.320
However, as soon as she'd embraced her new direction, she once again shifted course back

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:15.960
to more political content. This was fair enough, I suppose. She likely would have received flack

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:19.560
for over stigmatising the community if she'd only spoken out the worst of the worst through

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:24.280
her archetypal lens. On the flip side, though, there wasn't any greater cause that could shield

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:28.840
her from criticism for shortcomings that may be present in her content, so it was more imperative

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:33.640
than ever that she be rigorous and balanced in her presentation. Was she, though? Well, I mean,

01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:37.800
let's tackle the three most prevalent issues with Blair White throughout this video so far.

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:43.160
Poor research, reckless insensitivity, and I suppose what many would regard as invalidation.

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:47.080
The last one you'd hope would be a mostly outdated criticism, given the fact that she'd

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:50.840
obviously acknowledged how unfair she'd been in the past towards trans women who didn't pass

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:56.040
enough in her eyes, and how she wanted to move back to more serious, sensible content. However,

01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:01.000
the upload after this exposing phase, she uploaded a video called The Truth About Contrapoints and

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.920
Non-Binary, covering an incident that transpired in the political community at that time,

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:08.680
where Contra would face some pretty hostile resistance after expressing her predilection

01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:12.200
towards attitudes and environments with a more traditional approach to gender roles over the

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:17.320
hyper-woke spaces. Obviously, this is a person sharing their experiences and thoughts, and even

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:21.080
if you disagree or think it could have been worded more sensitively, some people definitely

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:25.800
overreacted. However, Blair had her own take. Well, maybe her opinion has reformed since then.

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:30.680
Speaking of transition, from what I can see, the overwhelming majority of non-binary people

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:34.360
do not transition. They don't get surgery, they don't get hormones, etc. Of course,

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:37.880
there are some, and there's gonna be someone in the comments, I know of someone, okay, well,

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:42.520
you know of someone. In terms of gender, I have about as much in common with a non-binary person

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:49.080
as I do my fiancé, who is not trans, just a guy, because he stayed at point A, just like

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:53.880
non-binary people do. No, not really. In fact, her video is packed with a large set of assumptions

01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:59.000
about the non-binary community, not really backed up with any proof or evidence, appearing kind of

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.200
pissed off, to be honest.

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:04.760
So, non-binary is a topic that comes up on my channel in passing, but I've never really gone

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:09.240
in-depth about my feelings towards non-binary people, non-binary as a concept,

01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:13.640
in terms of gender, obviously, and this person insisted that they were trans as well. They were

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:18.440
the same thing as me, right? This person was born male, presents as male, has not transitioned to

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:24.200
anything but male, doesn't mind going by male pronouns, but yet I'm supposed to accept that I'm

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:28.440
the same thing as this person. I'm sorry, but I'm not.

01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:32.600
I also can't really endorse her assertion that this is the first proper time she's made her feeling

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:37.160
apparent on the matter. I think she's been pretty clear, even in the midst of her hiatus from the

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:40.920
political community, she uploaded a video where she reacts to a non-binary individual with her

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:45.160
friend and fellow creator, Eden the Doll, and makes some pretty disparaging remarks, while also

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:47.560
continuously failing to address them correctly.

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:52.760
When you're assigned male at birth, you have to fight like f*** how to be feminine.

01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:55.880
You have to fight like f*** how to be feminine.

01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:03.400
He had to fight? What was your fight, girl? Picking the right shade of lipstick?

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:07.880
He's talking about a fight to be feminine when it's like, oh, a fight like surgery? Oh no,

01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:11.320
he's not done that. A fight like hormones? No, he hasn't done that. A fight like therapy? Oh,

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:14.440
he hasn't done that. A fight like changing your name legally? Oh, he hasn't done that.

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:19.560
So what's the fight? I feel like whenever people says like to refer to them as they and them,

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:24.600
they're like kind of saying that they have like multiple personalities, like split personalities,

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:29.080
like a million people. She also chose this practically unknown non-binary person as the

01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:34.600
quote, worse SJW over numerous other public figures in another video between then and now.

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:38.680
So here's one where she claims there is no such thing as male and female brains. That's what's

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:43.880
really, really annoying is you have all these random, honestly cisgender people claiming to

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:48.120
be trans to look cool and spreading out things like there's no such thing as male and female

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:52.520
brains. And then we find ourselves over here where she keeps reiterating the fact that non-binary

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:56.600
people are not the same as her, which is all well and good. I'm happy for her, but it's a

01:19:56.600 --> 01:20:01.640
misleading point. Take a look at this very short clip in which I tell the non-binary individual

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:06.840
that we are not the same. My name is Blair. I'm transgender and I'm a Republican. My name is Jamie.

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:12.360
I use they, them pronouns, identifies a queer non-binary trans femme. I also identify in the

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:19.400
spectrum of asexuality. I believe non-binary is under the trans umbrella. I completely reject how

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:24.680
non-binary people specifically have injected themselves into the trans label. I am a

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:28.840
transsexual. There's a medical basis for that. There's a scientific basis for that. And for

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:33.080
non-binary, it's really not the case. You don't know my life. You don't know my experiences with

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:38.360
gender dysphoria. I'm not saying that you're the one that said that I was erasing you as trans.

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:44.120
And I, I am like, you're not trans. Like there's a medical definition of being a trans. I'm going

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:49.160
to stop you. Jamie, how are you doing? I'm okay. You're okay? Yeah. Do you feel like talking? You

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:54.520
don't have to. Okay. Blair plays this clip like it's some huge gotcha, but it actually just shows

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:58.600
the disparity between the two points she's trying to make. Someone has asserted they fall under the

01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:02.520
umbrella and Blair disputes that, which is her prerogative, but that's not equatable to saying

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:06.520
that another person was claiming you were the same. In fact, they seek to emphasize they believe

01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:10.920
in a more inclusive label that Blair seems rather bothered by. You can only reclaim that these two

01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:14.920
points are compatible if you solely derive your identity from your trans label, something that

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:19.800
I'm sure Blair would never advocate for. No, I am not trying to bash non-binary people. I'm not

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:23.800
trying to say that I'm better than them, above them, higher than them. We all put our pants on

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:27.560
one leg at a time. We are all equals here. What I am saying is that we are different.

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:33.000
Okay. It seems to me that the goal of non-binary people is to completely destroy and deconstruct

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:39.160
the binary, and the goal of trans people is to operate within the binary, as in moving from one

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:44.520
to the other. Listen, guys, I'm talking about peace, love, understanding. I love everyone. We're all equal,

01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:48.840
especially the greengrocers. I'm sure some of them are great people, but I'm pretty sure the

01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:52.920
greengrocers are kidnapping cats and claiming the reward money when missing posters are put up. I have

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:57.560
to save some of this, but the point being, if you didn't like Blair before, she didn't seem to be

01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:03.400
more sensitive, and when it came to validation, this is someone who is not trans. This is someone

01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:08.840
who's claiming to be trans by what? Putting on lipstick and then going in the media talking about

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:14.120
trans issues as if they know. Well, if there's moving the goal posts, Blair was moving the gate

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:19.960
posts, but at least she still had her research sorted, right? Well, let's talk about it.

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:36.440
Okay, here's the thing. The first two points that we've discussed, Blair may defend herself on.

01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:41.400
She never promoted herself as a bastion of sensitivity. On the contrary, in fact, she knows she's the

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:45.560
problematic queen. If she has strong opinions, she's going to express them, regardless of who she

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:49.320
offends. If you were going to criticise her, you could say that this sort of attitude makes her more

01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:54.200
sensitive videos, such as her apology video to Riley Dennis, somewhat disingenuous.

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:59.000
There have been Reddit threads and 4chan threads with hundreds of comments on it, of people trying

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:04.040
to prove that I'm not trans because I haven't done this or that, or, you know, digging up my old

01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:11.080
pictures, and, you know, I'm a strong person, I'm a happy person, but to sit here and pretend like it

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:17.080
doesn't affect me at all would just be a lie. However, even with that said, she may respond to this,

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:21.240
claiming that these two situations are not equivalent. After all, her whole point was that

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:26.200
non-binary individuals were not the same as her, and this mostly staved off the criticism, even if it

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:31.000
did feel like an us versus them narrative sometimes, no matter how much Blair declared there was no ill

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.200
will in her rhetoric.

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:36.440
And honestly, I know I'm gonna get crucified for this video, but I really don't care. My intention is not to,

01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:42.600
again, bash, or put down, or belittle non-binary people. I really don't care what every way you identify as.

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:44.280
How about it?

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:48.360
We'll put this on the back burner for now, though, and turn our attention back to the third issue,

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:53.320
one that we wouldn't necessarily expect to be present in a video like this, that being poor research.

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:58.200
This is the one aspect of content that Blair wouldn't really have any defence against, after all, you can't

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:03.640
really dismiss it and say, deal with it, liberals, I'm bad at fact-checking. Intellectual rigour is to be

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:08.280
aspired for, regardless of political affiliation. However, in the aforementioned upload, not to be

01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:13.080
outdone, Blair manages to tick all three boxes with a rather bizarre citation.

01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:20.440
Another thing is that there is a long historical basis for transsexuals, like, as early as surgery was a thing,

01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:26.680
people were having the desire to change their sex. Gender dysphoria, previously known as gender identity

01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:31.720
disorder, is something that has been around forever, whereas this new wave of non-binary is literally

01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:36.200
something that's popped up maybe since 2014 and on. Google Trends shows it.

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:42.120
Ah yes, Google Trends, the bulwark for scientific grounding. Now I personally use it, and I have used it,

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:47.240
for illustrating public interest or awareness of a trend, but not for the existence of an entity,

01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:51.800
and Blair's assertion can be quickly challenged with a bit of actual research. For a video titled

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:57.080
The Truth About Contrapoints and Non-Binary, there isn't really much contrapoints, and there's also a

01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:02.040
distinct lack of truth, though I'll give up points for having no deficiency on the non-binary front.

01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:06.760
Recently, Sam Smith came out as non-binary and wants the entire world to use they-them pronouns,

01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:10.600
because it wasn't enough to be Russian famous, he also wants everyone around to bow down and,

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:12.440
you know, change their language for him.

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:16.840
The videos that followed were no less brash, with her attitudes seemingly becoming more and more

01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:21.240
impersonant, but I don't really want to focus on that, and let me make it clear, I could. We could

01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:25.400
talk about the thumbnails that continue to feature people who have nothing to do with the video topic

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:30.040
and merely serve to allow Blair to pull her grossed out face, despite the fact she was literally just

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:34.200
called out for that, or we could talk about her ridiculous and pointless flame war with a smaller

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:39.240
creator where she once again resorts to insulting the person's trans identity regardless of what

01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:45.080
they said. Just grow up. The antics that persisted after this, with the photoshopping and all that

01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:49.800
crap, I have nothing else to add, it is self-explanatory at this point.

01:25:49.800 --> 01:26:02.760
So, with all that behind us, let's talk about the children, a topic that has always been very close

01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:07.720
to Blair's heart, and one that has also been the centre of gender discourse for a long time.

01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:12.280
Certain commentators in particular take an interest because it's a sensitive and controversial topic

01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:17.240
that has led to some mishaps in the past, and obviously, in these instances, there can be ramifications

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:22.680
of great moral significance. At the same time, with such topics, given their sensitivity, it requires

01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:26.680
attention to detail, and respect for those who may be affected by the consequences such

01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:31.160
narratives may invoke. Blair, like she did with a fair few other subjects, held a pretty cautious

01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:35.560
stance on the matter, but mostly tried to talk about the issue from a perspective of common sense,

01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:40.280
a safe bet with the internet at least. However, her track record on the subject wasn't the cleanest,

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:44.600
she had previously generated some controversy a few years back in a now-deleted video titled

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:49.080
Child Transitioning Equals Child Abuse, the title being the least provocative component.

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:53.800
In the infamous upload, she claims that the mother is pimping out her child's identity for profit.

01:26:54.360 --> 01:27:00.280
Hm, what are the odds that a transgender activist gives birth to a kid who ends up being transgender?

01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:05.160
Shocking coincidence, right? So then the question becomes, was she an ideologue before or after her

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:11.000
kid became trans? Well, her pinned tweet is of her doing a public talk years ago in which she

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:16.600
explains how her child transitioned at four. Four. A really quick Google of the mother shows that

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:21.400
she's been doing press and interviews and talks for years about her kid, and I'm sorry, but this

01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:27.160
just reeks of pimping out your kid. She also has her own organization called Transparenting, she

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:32.440
sells t-shirts. I mean, this is lucrative for her, and I'm sure that this cover of National Geographic

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:37.880
is just her big brain. This was not just debatable, but frankly preposterous, and research showed that

01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:42.760
the mother, who was the prime recipient of these characterizations, was practically the antithesis

01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:47.160
of everything that Blair alleged, leaving many to arraign the creator for inducing a tidal wave of

01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:52.520
hatred against a person who was merely trying to support her daughter. But okay, that was 2016,

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:57.480
Blair. This was 2019, I'm not going to give a spiel about the fact that she had a wider audience now

01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:01.720
because we know that doesn't play a large role in dictating her narrative, but allow me to give a

01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:06.680
brief preamble about this situation. Essentially, just under a couple of years back, a child became

01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:11.560
the center of a political tug of war after the divorced parents disputed their gender. The father

01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:15.720
in this family claimed that the mother was forcefully transitioning one of their children against

01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:20.440
their will, setting up a page and fundraiser to fight the custody battle after a jury ruled against

01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:24.920
him. This caught wind in the media and online conservative circles, causing the issue to become

01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:29.640
quickly politicized as well, with one allegedly highly incriminating clip making the rounds, in

01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:32.760
which the child claims the mother told them that they were a girl.

01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:34.760
You're a boy, right?

01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:37.760
No, I'm a girl.

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:39.760
Who told you you were a girl?

01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:40.760
Mommy.

01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:45.400
Blair decides to weigh in on this matter, after all, her personal investments run deep, and she delivers

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.880
a decisive verdict on the clip in question.

01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:53.560
So you guys, this video to me is... I don't even want to get emotional, it's so sad. I think first of all,

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:58.360
you know, children going through custody battles and, you know, being weaponized by either party or

01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:03.400
both parties and just going through that is so sad, and adding in this transgender layer, but you

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:10.120
know, I have to be honest, the child saying, my mom told me I'm a girl, um, not cool. Now, I've been

01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:15.320
looking into this story and many people are saying that this child has been coached and is being

01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:20.920
forced into this, and just based on what I have seen, I have to agree with that. That is personally

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:21.960
my opinion.

01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:26.120
She then moves on to the regular narratives about the transgender community and the discussion about

01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:31.160
putting children on hormones at the age of seven, and the dangerous, dangerous consequences it can have.

01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:35.880
The institutions who have supported this and pushed it through and caused a great, great threat to this

01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:39.080
child who is far too young to make such a decision for themselves.

01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:45.880
I don't know. Sometimes I seriously lose faith that trans people will ever be accepted into society and

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:53.720
integrated into society when just the insanity that comes out of the community is so constant.

01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:56.840
I don't know. I just feel like we never have anything positive coming out of the community. I feel like it's

01:29:56.840 --> 01:30:01.480
always, if you don't date me, you're transphobic. Yes, seven-year-olds can decide to transition.

01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:05.320
Yes, male athletes who popped two estrogen pills should be able to compete against women and demolish

01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:13.000
them. Like, when, like, when is the community going to step up and realize things are going too far

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.960
and regain some credibility here? Because it's not looking good. It really isn't. Honestly, the

01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:22.280
biggest thing for me, this is a kind of different rant, the biggest thing for me is that the trans

01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:26.600
community seems to have no self-awareness of how they're viewed by the outside world. They

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:31.240
literally have no clue. A lot of these people are so caught up in their own sort of discourse and

01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:37.800
people who agree with them that they don't realize how insane it sounds that a seven-year-old is

01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:42.600
having his gender changed legally, is going to appointments for puberty blockers, and they just

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:49.080
think it's so bewildering that anyone could possibly conceivably think, should we slow down

01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:55.480
just a little bit? No, transphobe. Like, it's just disgusting. But here, Blair was engendering much

01:30:55.480 --> 01:31:00.360
more trouble than any of the people that she seems so concerned about. I'll say this, you know, in the

01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:06.360
off chance that the mother of James is viewing this video, I don't want to come across as I am

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:12.280
attacking you. In fact, I would like to publicly reach out via this video if you watch it and say,

01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:16.840
let's have a conversation. I would love to talk to you. I am not some random internet troll,

01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:22.040
I'm not some anonymous person on Twitter, I'm not some hater. I'm a trans woman myself, and if

01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:27.000
anything, I've walked this path that your son and yourself may seem to think is the right path for

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:31.880
him, and I'm actually willing to talk to both of you. But it's okay, I guess. At least she's willing

01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:35.640
to have a discussion. Well, Blair, let's talk about it.

01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:48.760
You know, it's so sad, but I hope to God that James

01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:55.400
lucks out in the sense that he grows up and truly is trans and also doesn't want a family,

01:31:55.400 --> 01:32:00.200
because those are the only two circumstances that would validate the choices being made for him

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:05.000
right now, is if he both is really trans, to which he won't regret the medications,

01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:10.440
and that he doesn't want kids, because it already seems to be decided up for him right now,

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:16.520
that that's the case. Before it was circulated by a load of conservative outlets, creators,

01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:20.920
and even some on the liberal end of the spectrum, this whole story was pretty comprehensively

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:25.320
investigated by a creator called Timber on Toast, who quashes most of the narratives put forward by

01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:29.160
those in favour of the father. You should go and watch that one after this, but he shows that the

01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:33.880
dad in this instance is by no means a helpless passenger losing his son, but someone who

01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:38.760
instigated a lot of trouble which was practically rebuked by every medical professional who supported

01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:43.960
the contrary perspective. Dr. Johnson receives a letter from the child's father, in which he makes

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:49.800
allegations about the child's mother. This letter is ignored by Dr. Johnson, who sees the child

01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:55.480
and diagnoses them with gender identity disorder. Following the diagnosis, the medical centre tries

01:32:55.480 --> 01:33:00.280
to contact the father to keep him involved in the process. He delays scheduling an interview

01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:06.200
with them, saying that he is gathering information he wants to present to the head doctor. The records

01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:11.080
show that he never followed up on scheduling that interview. The therapist confirms the diagnosis of

01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:15.720
gender dysphoria which was made by Dr. Johnson, and advises the mother that it would be better

01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:20.600
for the child's psychological well-being to socially affirm them as Luna, which is a girl's

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:26.200
name that the child has chosen for themself. The therapist advises scheduling another appointment

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:31.800
when the child is eight or nine to discuss whether or not hormone blockers are an appropriate measure

01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:38.040
to take. By this time, it transpires that the child's father has contacted Dr. Johnson,

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:43.960
Child Protective Services, Genesis Clinic and the follow-up psychologist, making allegations to all

01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:48.760
of them that the mother is abusing the child. He states that he suspects the mother is suffering

01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:54.200
from Munchausen by proxy, the very same mental illness proposed by Dr. Michelle Critella,

01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:59.800
the lady quoted in all those articles I read about this case. None of the professionals who receive

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:04.760
the father's letters find his allegations to be credible. This information can also be found in

01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:08.920
court documents published around that time if you're fun enough to read them, and I'm not saying

01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:13.320
this necessarily makes the mother a saint or that this whole hubbub even has a bearing on the

01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:17.480
child's identity, which has now probably been completely disrupted by political figures sticking

01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:21.080
their nose in far too deep to a case they have no knowledge of, and interfering with a court

01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:25.880
case which has been deliberated and heard out by a jury. However, once again, a preconceived narrative

01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:29.880
was pushed as truth without question. I mean, hell, the governor of Texas basically complained

01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:32.600
that his own judicial system wasn't working well enough.

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:36.840
I love you. Please leave a comment. I want to know everyone's thoughts. Please share this video as

01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:40.920
well. I feel like this is extremely important. Blair was a part of that, and she, of course,

01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:44.840
doesn't have the mainstream draw of any of the figures who took to Twitter to make known their

01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:49.160
outrage, but it was once more wrapped in those points of view that tried to make her look like

01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:54.120
this disillusioned observer and frustrated moderate that was becoming more and more tiresome

01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:57.880
by the upload. And honestly, even wearing what they want, if I'm being completely honest, I don't

01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:01.960
have an issue with that at all. But the mother has been going to consultations for puberty bloggers,

01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:06.600
is quote, not ruling it out. And it seems like this boy's fate is already decided. You know,

01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:10.920
I do believe seven year olds can experience gender dysphoria. I was one of them, but no

01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:16.760
seven year old is prepared mentally, emotionally, anything to make the decision to go on puberty

01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:21.160
blockers and then hormones and then live as a woman at seven. You also see in the court notes

01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:26.840
that there is no concrete plan for the child to go on hormone blockers. The child is six years old.

01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:30.920
It's stated that when they are eight or nine, they will have another consultation where they

01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:35.480
will seek advice on whether or not hormone blockers are the correct course of action.

01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:38.680
Back when she was edgier than this and controversial, you could at least say it

01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:42.440
was pretty clear where she would stand. But here it just felt like a bit of a ruse.

01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:46.200
Blair constructs a fair few of her videos like this, especially when they're short and quite

01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:50.600
loosely formulated. She starts with a root situation and branches off with a variety of

01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:55.240
observations and opinions. You can deal with a few of those branches being off, a few points that

01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:59.480
don't quite hit. However, if the whole root discussion is off, then the video is basically

01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:03.960
nullified. Most people, left or right wing, wouldn't advocate for young children undergoing

01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:08.120
hormone therapy because, like Blair said, there can be serious consequences for a decision

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:13.240
undertaken at such a young age when one still has a very uncertain grasp of their identity.

01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:17.960
However, because the mother wasn't actually advocating that, Blair's secondary points here

01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:22.760
don't feel authentic. It often feels like Blair shapes the evidence to fit the narrative rather

01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:27.640
than vice versa, which is risky business with such a high stakes case. And she wasn't the only person

01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:31.560
who did it here. I will make that clear. But there's a point where if you use your identity

01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:35.720
as a badge of credibility, you need to certify it by proving you're better than those who are

01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:40.760
pushing identical points of view. Otherwise, that additional experience means very little.

01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:44.760
Now I'm transgender and I have feelings of gender dysphoria at that age as well.

01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:50.120
But one thing was that I felt like a girl at that age, but it wasn't because anyone was telling me.

01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:54.440
It wasn't because anyone was putting anything on me. It was actually the opposite.

01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:58.440
It was the entire world, including my parents telling me, you're a boy, you're a boy, you're a boy,

01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:04.920
and me still feeling that way. So it was not based on what my parents were instructing me on.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.960
So that's incredibly worrisome in my opinion.

01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:11.960
I think the problem is perfectly embodied in a situation like this, when you have a common

01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:15.640
sense position. Many viewers, regardless of political background, will be in unison that

01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:20.360
a mother should not force a child to transition against their will. But Blair utilizes the case

01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:24.920
and pushes the narrative of the dangers that transgender extremities within the ideology

01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:29.080
will produce. Blair's assertions appeal to mainstream audiences because the positions

01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:33.160
they're rooted in are moderate by nature. That's the catch. But she's validating this

01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:37.640
stance through a manufactured scenario. Sometimes she picked up the narrative from secondary

01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:42.280
sources such as the I'm a predator, but it's okay because I'm trans, where she once again echoes

01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:45.960
many claims that this individual received early release from prison because of their gender

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:50.200
identity, which was later contested. I'm going to read this headline to you. Convicted Pedo

01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:54.600
to be released from jail after becoming a woman, no longer deemed a threat.

01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:01.400
We need to dissect this. So that person was sent to prison and is now being released.

01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:08.200
Get this, because they are identifying and transitioning into a woman. Literally because,

01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:12.600
and I thought that can't be the reason there has to be maybe like, I don't know, good behavior or

01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:18.280
an exoneration. No, this person still did what they did, but is getting released because they're

01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:23.400
on hormones and according to the judge, no longer deemed a threat. So apparently the recommendation

01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:29.560
for Josie to be released was based on the fact that Josie is on hormones, estrogen, and apparently

01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:35.400
now doesn't have a high sex drive, and so they think it's a low risk future offender and that

01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:39.480
they're confident Josie is not going to offend in the future. Side note, I love how she states that

01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:44.200
parole isn't about the risk of reoffending 30 seconds after lamenting that this individual

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:49.320
wasn't released for good behavior, which of course has nothing to do with the risk of reoffending.

01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:53.800
It's the same routine, moderate position. No one's going to agree that a person's sentence should be

01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:58.120
shortened just because of their gender identity, but on further investigation that appears to not

01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:03.080
be the case. However, it's that P word again that seems to not make a lot of people think twice.

01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:07.480
I'll defend Blair on the front that a lot of the facts were only easily accessible after she had

01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:12.600
released the video. However, the same can't be said for exposing games to a transgender person video,

01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:16.200
which includes her own interpretation of personally collated research.

01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:21.800
Tiffany proclaimed on her social media that her child now, go figure, is trans, specifically

01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:28.840
non-binary, refers to them as a gentle them, which is so, like, that makes me want to do something

01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:33.320
very permanent to myself that I won't say because I'll get demonetized. There's photos of Tiffany

01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:37.480
painting the nails of this small child, which on its face is not bad. I don't think anything is

01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:42.360
wrong with pigment on someone's nails, boys or girls, but when you couple it with now trying to

01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:46.680
convince your child that they are also trans, that's an issue for me. People also message me

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:51.480
with concerns over photos with Tiffany and Tiffany's boyfriend, someone out there for

01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:58.120
everyone apparently, wearing fetish collars around the sun, posting really weird photos of the sun

01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:06.760
laying in his crotch while he's wearing women's panties. Yeah, so all of that's really concerning

01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:13.720
as well as a bunch of photos of Tiffany seemingly posing very seductively in bed with the kid and,

01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:19.880
like, you don't want to attribute something, you know, nefarious that isn't necessarily there,

01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:25.880
but when you couple it with all the other things and the fetish collar and the weird picture where

01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:30.200
the kid is in between the lap and the women's panties, you know, it's just very suspect and

01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:33.720
I'm not making any direct accusations here, but I think it's something worth looking at.

01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:38.280
Now, there are many causes for concern when it comes to Tiffany's social media conduct and

01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:43.240
parenting skills that I would raise, but none of these explicitly prove what's denoted in the title.

01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:47.640
Hell, Blair's own video seems to state this, but once again, the video's presentation of the word

01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:53.160
predator and ultimately inconclusive evidence of a person who I stress is with their child is a

01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:57.640
massive stretch. The use of the word predator is no longer just being used to play towards that

01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:02.600
mainstream audience. It's a word that provokes strong feelings and universal condemnation.

01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:06.520
No one wants to defend a predator, but how low are you willing to set the bar?

01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:12.840
And I hope to God that things are not as bad as they seem to be just based on social media,

01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:17.240
but what we know about social media is that it's like the highlight reel of people's lives.

01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:22.360
So a fair proportion of what Blair presents as moderate has been first distorted to appeal to

01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:26.600
the moderate crowd, though a lot of the time it is unclear whether it has been distorted before

01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:31.640
Blair has interpreted the content or not. Although Blair has her biases, she may just be a bit

01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:36.040
susceptible to them. To say definitively that she's actively neglecting due diligence,

01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:40.280
you'd need a bit more solidified evidence that she was misrepresenting the content that she

01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:44.600
depicts on her channel, henceforth undermining so many of her precious narratives.

01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:47.240
And that wasn't exactly there yet.

01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:51.480
Blair- Still, one day left in 2019, and I feel like 2019 was no one's year.

01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:56.040
I feel like no one is making it out alive this year without some sort of cancellation,

01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:58.920
some sort of scandal, and I'm a little shocked.

01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:01.400
But it seemed that we were about to receive it.

01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:15.320
One of the points that many sympathetic to Blair would draw from a fair proportion of

01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:18.840
her commentary is that even if you feel she's wrong time to time, that she was at least

01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:22.760
consistent to her fault, and that most of these issues that we've observed are yielded in a

01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:27.160
variety of political cliques due to a fairly basic application of confirmation bias.

01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:31.640
Her greatest failing was parroting misinformation rather than looking it up for herself,

01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:36.040
but this theory would be tested when a new situation arose, thanks to someone by the name of

01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:41.240
J.K. Rowling. J.K. Rowling is a pretty famous novelist who shouldn't require much introduction,

01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:45.480
but she is primarily known for her authorship of the Harry Potter book series, an international

01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:49.960
best-selling saga of fantasy novels, which launched an equally successful set of films,

01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:54.120
which has only manifested its fandom in the years following. On a more personal level,

01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:58.200
many regard them as a pretty integral part of their childhood, and hold the works very close

01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:03.000
to their heart. However, in recent times, some have found themselves alienated by Rowling's divisive

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:07.320
political nature. What sort of convictions were these? Well, you may be shocked to find

01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:12.440
they were related to gender. Yes, despite having socially liberal views on many issues,

01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:17.640
she began to attract disapproval from some online after expressing support for Maya Forstata,

01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:21.880
an individual who had lost an employment tribunal after her relationship with the business was

01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:26.680
discontinued due to statements the firm had deemed ill-suited for her position. At the time,

01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:30.600
it was implied that she had been sacked with immediate effect, and some headlines also

01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:35.480
understated the extent of Forstata's comments, but even with this information publicly available,

01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:40.120
Rowling didn't back down. White was also someone who advocated for Forstata at the time,

01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:43.800
and a few days later would make a video defending J.K. Rowling's comments.

01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:49.000
J.K. Rowling is actually someone who has traditionally been referred to as very woke,

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:53.960
someone who is very much favourite by the type of people who go out and call everyone transphobic,

01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:59.160
so I was really curious as to why everyone was saying this. And apparently, it's because of

01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:04.680
this tweet. Stress however you please is the first line. Not seeing any issues so far,

01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:09.560
I feel like that is very agreeable. Who disagrees with that? I don't really know.

01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:18.040
Call yourself whatever you like. Okay. We're choosing our names out here. Love it.

01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:21.800
Now, as noted, there wouldn't necessarily be a huge issue with Rowling's tweet if its

01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:25.800
presupposition was correct. Most people took issue with the fact that she backed someone

01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:30.200
who many found held unsavoury ideas that were unbefitting for a position, and the fact that

01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:34.680
the inference followed that certain gender identities were merely about how one dresses.

01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:38.760
Now, one thing that I will say is that there was a lot of misinformation on both sides that

01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:44.120
muddied the waters unnecessarily. However, the hearing in question did not rule against Forstata

01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:48.520
on the basis that she believed sex wasn't real, more on the fact that she was judged as believing

01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:53.000
that trans women were not women, and pronouns aside, she would not refer to them as such,

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:57.640
even if they were recognised otherwise officially, and that her take on the matter was deemed

01:44:57.640 --> 01:45:02.840
absolutist, henceforth possibly yielding behaviour that could be seen as hostile to the work

01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:06.680
environment. Meyer's beliefs were repeated throughout the trial, even when explaining

01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:11.160
her misgendering of a non-binary person continuing to misgender them, I'll add.

01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:16.440
Something else which Blair harves on, in fact, managing to misgender this person as well.

01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:20.520
BLAIR Now, it's going around that Maya actually was on Twitter and misgendered a trans woman,

01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:24.600
and I'm going to put that trans woman up on the screen, and I want you guys to tell me

01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:28.680
what pronoun you would probably naturally use for this individual. Right?

01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:35.320
With all this said, you can still disagree with the ruling and think that she should be free to

01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:40.520
express those opinions on her social media without fear of reprimand. The judge does acknowledge that

01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:44.360
there are shades of grey in this case, and I think they can be observed when reading the court

01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:49.720
document. In fairness to Blair, she recognises this, is critical towards Forstater, and expresses

01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:54.200
her opinion of the information available to her. BLAIR But I also will say it's my opinion that

01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:59.000
these are not beliefs that I think should warrant someone being fired for their job. I understand

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:03.160
it's a private company, and they can decide who has the values that align with themselves,

01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:08.280
and that's totally fine. I respect that, right? I respect the companies, right? 100%. But two things

01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:13.560
can be true at once. You can respect the company's right to hire and fire as they see fit, and also

01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:17.640
think it's kind of a lame reason for firing her, in my opinion. I personally don't think the jury

01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:21.160
is out on a lot of these issues that we're debating and talking about, and so I feel like

01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:24.840
we should be allowed to have them without fear of risking of losing our jobs.

01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:29.160
At this time, she also takes a moment to affirm her stance on JK Rowling.

01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:33.880
I do not think JK Rowling is transphobic. I think she's probably someone who is paying attention to

01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:38.760
this culture war happening on gender, and if we're just basing off of her tweet, I don't see

01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:43.560
anything transphobic in her tweet. That was a big reason, her simply stating that biological sex is

01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:49.960
real, and if we're getting to a point where we can't say that, girl.

01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:55.000
And to be honest, maybe Rowling was misinformed, but that doesn't prove that she was outly transphobic,

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:00.760
so Blair concluding on this point was a safe bet, especially for her audience. However, as always,

01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:05.720
Blair set a benchmark for her opinion, and that meant she was going to defend it pretty staunchly.

01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:10.840
However, this would be tested as Rowling's fiascos escalated. Essays were published, tweets were

01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:15.080
posted, heated interactions were shared, some of which certainly seemed questionable on the

01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:19.480
writer's front. However, Blair maintained her stance, framing the author's outlook as mostly

01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:24.360
misunderstood by those who want to simplify it to one that could easily be classified as bigoted,

01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:27.240
without the nuance or respect it deserved.

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:30.600
Conservative and liberal, the world is definitely right now divided into people

01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:34.760
who can have a meaningful nuanced conversation about sensitive issues,

01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:40.520
and people who can't. That's it. That's the division I see these days. The conversation

01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:44.920
gets very muddy because people who are on the outside looking in at this whole fiasco happening,

01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:49.240
they really do think trans people are turning on JK Rowling and don't like JK Rowling anymore

01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:54.200
because they think JK Rowling is transphobic. But I want you guys, the next time you hear someone

01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:59.800
talking about how transphobic someone is, please pay attention to who is saying it. I think I know

01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:05.080
what transphobia looks like, and try as I might, and as many people are in my ear trying to tell

01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:10.120
me that JK Rowling was transphobic in these tweets, I'm not seeing it as a trans woman,

01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:14.120
and that's my genuine opinion. However, Blair's commitment to this standpoint would be tried

01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:18.360
once more when Rowling released a crime novel, directly spawning further allegations of

01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:22.680
transphobia due to its portrayal of a character who doesn't conform to traditional gender roles

01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:28.440
as a sadistic predator. This was the rallying cry for Blair to drop her hot take, so in typical form,

01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:33.240
she uploaded a video declaring she'd read the book, and that people were once more overreacting

01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:37.480
to a simple detail. How could we doubt such an informed observer?

01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:41.800
This time, everyone is up in arms about her new book being released called Trouble to Blood, and

01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:48.760
just a heads up, I read the book. The concept of being a transvestite makes a very quick, brief,

01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:55.240
fleeting appearance in the book, and it's extremely unimportant. It comes in the form of one line in

01:48:55.240 --> 01:49:02.200
the book, one page in a 900 page book, and it's where the killer is described in one of the

01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:08.120
instances of him snatching a woman up as wearing a disguise of a wig and a woman's coat. That's it.

01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:14.280
I'm not kidding, that's it. That is everything to do that you could even remotely, if you really

01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:19.080
stretched your mind, sort of bring that to the idea of transgenderism.

01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:24.360
Well, the first red flags come when you realise she is wrong. In fact, there are multiple pages that could

01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:29.640
be deemed troublesome in their content. But okay, maybe Blair just missed other references. We all

01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:34.200
know she's not the most meticulous sometimes. Well, this becomes even more concerning when you

01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:39.480
realise that she was not even the first person to make this specific error. In fact, this incorrect

01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:44.600
assertion had been published in a spectator article a few days prior, and also spoken about on

01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:45.720
public interviews.

01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:50.120
I want to read this excerpt from a review on the spectator that I completely agree with. Let me put

01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:55.720
it like this. When you reach the last pages, the full absurdity of the statement that Rowling's

01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:59.240
moral seems to be, never trust a man in a dress, will be revealed.

01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:04.440
Just going back to the book itself, from what I understand, it's simply just one line, and it's

01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:09.880
not even necessarily referring to the killer as a transvestite. I think it just mentions that the

01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:15.560
killer at one point wore a wig and a woman's coat, so that there is no trans rhetoric coming out of

01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:21.160
this book at all. Then you combine this with the fact that she claimed to have read a 900 page book

01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:26.360
in the space of 12 hours, which although not impossible, seems even less likely to be the truth

01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:30.520
with the additional information available. It's like when two people sitting next to each other

01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:34.760
make the exact same mistake in a test, you kinda know that one of them is cheating.

01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:38.520
Because coming from the perspective of someone who did read this book in the last 24 hours,

01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:45.000
there's no honest, genuine way you can link the two. I mean honestly, anyone coming to the conclusion

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.840
that this somehow demonises transgender people is either lying or has not read the book,

01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:51.720
or is really really nutty.

01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:55.560
Some may have admired Blair's readiness to defend Rowling against the quote,

01:50:55.560 --> 01:51:00.280
woke brigade, but if she was prepared to falsely claim she had conducted research that she actually

01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:04.920
hadn't with the intent to bestow herself with extra credibility, how trustworthy

01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:09.880
was she as a source and as a creator, and how many were beginning to take notice.

01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:18.360
While I do believe that her book is extremely problematic, and before you can comment like,

01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:23.160
did you even read it? Yes, I read the book. At least I read the first 10 chapters that were free.

01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:27.160
I was not about to pay this woman for her book. And honestly, the first 10 chapters are all you

01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:32.280
need to read to like, determine that one, Blair's a liar, and two, JK Rowling is a little like...

01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:36.200
Most of the excerpts I've referenced in the previous part were derived from a video by

01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:40.520
trans YouTuber Samantha Lux, who made a video responding to Blair, not just correcting the

01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:44.680
misinformation in her video, but also responding to a lot of the ensuing arguments that Blair

01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:48.680
had averted. Blair demanded in her video that she is not a cross trans woman, she's not a

01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:53.720
transvestite, so to say that characters like Buffalo Bill, or to say characters like Dennis

01:51:53.720 --> 01:52:01.480
Creed have any impact on her would be offensive. Girl. Girl. It is not only incorrect to say that,

01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:05.960
but it's wildly irresponsible. I'm not claiming that these movies, or even JK Rowling's new book,

01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:09.960
should be trashed, or that you can't watch them, or enjoy them. All I'm trying to say is that we

01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:15.560
need to be aware of the ways that representation of identities in media affect our perception of

01:52:15.560 --> 01:52:20.360
those identities. It's a pretty solid response, and it certainly brought some previously wandering

01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:24.600
eyes firmly onto Miss White's questionable groundwork and retitude. There have been doubts

01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:28.520
earlier on in the year related to her coverage of Darby Vanity, where she appeared to use the

01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:32.440
source material of another creator known as Temimi, while contorting the perspective to

01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:34.600
protect the infamous Jeffree Star.

01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:39.640
TEMIMI Blair White, the person who has gained over 500,000 subscribers for doing this,

01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:44.360
omitted information in her video, and then lied about it. Oh, right, that's because she used some

01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:48.840
of my clips in her video, and I could tell this specifically from the music I've used,

01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:55.080
and also from the pictures that I personally edited out, so that way my video wouldn't get

01:52:55.080 --> 01:53:01.080
buried in the algorithm. But in the first, like, 60 seconds I want to say of my Darby Vanity video,

01:53:01.080 --> 01:53:08.040
I put up screenshots where Jeffree Star says these tweets, and then I emphasize the date on it,

01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:12.840
and then right after there's another clip of him talking about going on tours, and doing all this

01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:17.080
stuff with Darby, and supporting him again, and making a song, and then boom there's a date on it

01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:22.600
again. And Blair White had the audacity to omit that information, she clipped it out,

01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:27.720
and made it seem like, wow, Jeffree Star is this hero for saying something about Darby Vanity,

01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:31.480
and never mentioned the fact that he had retracted his statements.

01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:50.440
You know, Jeffree worked with him, and then tweeted that, and then it was over.

01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:57.240
What do you mean you didn't have all of the facts? They were right there, 20 seconds into the video

01:53:57.240 --> 01:54:02.920
of mine that you downloaded for your video! That's a lie, Blair!

01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:07.320
At the time, however, in spite of the pretty irrefutable evidence contributing to this pattern,

01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:12.040
this didn't seem to affect her reputation too much, partly because the original video included this

01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:16.920
as a chapter, rather than as a dedicated subject, and although a more popular video was also posted

01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:20.840
on the subject, some people struggled to follow it without the background information.

01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:24.600
Combine this with the fact that this was still a footnote in Blair's greater video, and she was

01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:29.400
exposing someone rather reprehensible nonetheless, and most people appeared to let it slide.

01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:33.960
She would also appear to go against Jeffree Star in a later video, though some found it slightly

01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:38.920
convenient. It covers James Charles and another unnamed YouTuber, and it's a very uneasy upload,

01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:43.800
to say the least, with Blair mostly rambling, once again feeling like she was attempting to find a

01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:49.480
reason to publish a video with a snappy title, but ultimately culminating to very little.

01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:52.920
BLAIR What? You know what I'm saying? Like, if this is my first interaction with you,

01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:57.400
and you feel comfortable to tell me this, thinking that I'm just going to be in on this little game

01:54:57.400 --> 01:55:02.760
and complicit, and hee hee hee, no! That's something serious! And yes, it did take me a

01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:07.560
month to do this video, but that's because I have been scared! This is something serious!

01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:11.960
And I want to be very clear, this is not my place to out this person, you know, the victim's name,

01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:17.080
because this is clearly their story to tell, but you guys have to understand the position I'm in.

01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:23.720
If I receive credible information that a very famous, very powerful YouTuber is a sexual

01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:32.680
molecular or predator, but am I complicit with helping cover up for a predator by not saying

01:55:32.680 --> 01:55:37.000
that at least that much is true? I have to say, I do find the tone of the video rather confusing,

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:41.320
because although I think it's fair to call Jeffree out for his pathetic behavior, I was confused as

01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:46.280
to what trap Blair was breaking out of exactly by going public with this information after it was

01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:51.960
already public, but I digress. What matters is that the JK Rowling video attracted attention towards

01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:56.360
Blair's potential missteps, though once again, I think people were more focused on the present,

01:55:56.360 --> 01:56:01.640
and it would likely phase out as it normally does, provided she didn't exacerbate the situation with

01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:06.680
greater blunders, but Blair's errors were always pretty scattershot in their occurrence, so what

01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:11.240
were the chances that would happen? Well, maybe she tempted fate one too many times.

01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:14.920
And with that in mind, let's talk about trans athletes.

01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:19.240
And there are plenty of female athletes that could absolutely wipe the floor with me.

01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:24.200
Female athletes in the comments, just comment what sport you want to beat me in, because you can do it.

01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:25.480
Any of them. Pick one.

01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:30.760
Transgender athletes is another subject of interest on the Blair White Network, and it's not hard to see

01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:35.880
why, as it, like many other channel favorites, it pertains to gender identity, and how it interacts

01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:40.200
with other social variables. It has similarly been the center of heated debate for a few years,

01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:44.920
given the often-gendered nature of sports, and questions surrounding the suitability of individuals

01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:49.640
whose gender identity some feel could give them an unfair physical advantage against cisgender

01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:53.320
athletes. With this in mind, you can probably take a guess where Blair stands.

01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:58.600
Blair White's sports teams are segregated for biological reasons, therefore, even for trans people,

01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:03.480
you have to take biology into account, and it should not just be based on identity, it should

01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:08.040
be based on their bodies, and their puberty they went through, how early did they transition,

01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:10.920
how late did they transition. I think all of that matters.

01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:16.360
Well, little surprise there, but up until September of 2020, she hadn't really been caught up in too

01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:20.760
much controversy, mostly holding her own within the discourse on the affair, partly accountable to

01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:25.000
the fact that there is still some ambiguity within the public sphere, even on the more liberal side

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:29.160
of the political spectrum. Therefore, it must have seemed like a routine upload when she decided to

01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:35.080
criticise a transgender powerlifter for competing against women, despite the visible bodily superiority.

01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:45.160
The bigger point is, the idea, the concept of Janae competing against biological women is ludicrous,

01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:49.800
it's almost intentionally ignorant, and anyone who thinks that that is some sort of level playing field

01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:59.080
is a liar. I mean, the audacity of anyone to pretend or insist that there are no very obvious

01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:04.840
benefits that Janae as someone who developed completely male well into her adulthood would enjoy

01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:09.000
when competing against people who did not develop male is insanity.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:12.920
She metaphorically tackles the person at the crux of this curious case,

01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:17.640
Janae Marie Kroc, and moves on. However, there was one little hitch.

01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:22.360
And something we don't often see is that Janae actually went back post-transition and competed

01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:29.320
against men just because I guess like it was kind of like she's gone back and forth competing with

01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:35.560
men and women based on I don't know what. I mean, that's just a move. No pun intended.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:44.200
This was all fundamentally untrue. Yes, Kroc had long made the commitment to not compete against

01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:49.400
women. But okay, Blair made a false assumption. This isn't new territory. Well, you see, the

01:58:49.400 --> 01:58:53.720
information that Kroc would not be competing against women under any circumstances was

01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:58.280
actually written in one of the posts that Blair references. In fact, it's in the post that Blair

01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:02.680
uses to push her point Janae Marie Kroc is competing against women. Up until that point in

01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:06.760
the video, although it had been implied, she'd mostly spoken about Kroc's involvement in women's

01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:11.320
competitions, as if it was a hypothetical. With this post, she solidified that assumption,

01:59:11.320 --> 01:59:15.640
when really, reading that post should have debunked it. Not soon after the upload, Kroc

01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:19.560
posts a comment on the video and a separate Instagram statement expressing her dismay at

01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:24.120
the misinformation being disseminated, and the consequences it could have. This was also picked

01:59:24.120 --> 01:59:28.440
up pretty quickly by a fair few online, with creator Sam Collins uploading a response to Blair

01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:33.800
around a week after, primarily covering this mishap alongside other prior incidents. In spite of this

01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:38.200
criticism, though, Blair did not respond. This was not out of the ordinary for her, she was used to

01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:43.160
being castigated by communities. This time, though, the outrage didn't subside. In fact, as she

01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:47.400
appeared to provide people with radio silence, their annoyance only grew, demanding more

01:59:47.400 --> 01:59:52.360
accountability from someone of her size. As the videos and comments piled up, it became clear that

01:59:52.360 --> 01:59:57.080
this was something that had to be addressed, and in mid-October, two to three weeks after Janae's

01:59:57.080 --> 02:00:01.720
initial comment, the video was finally removed. At this point, though, a mere attraction wouldn't

02:00:01.720 --> 02:00:06.120
suffice for many viewers. She had already caused excessive harm, and that needed to be rectified,

02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:10.760
not just for her sake, but for the sake of the affected party. At the same time, as some began

02:00:10.760 --> 02:00:14.840
to take note of her other transgressions that had previously flown under the radar, the backlash

02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:20.280
began to augment in new ways, and some began to wonder how much Blair had to apologise for.

02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:25.560
Janae's Mom- So I want to be as clear and upfront in this video as I humanly can be, because I have

02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:29.720
essentially disabled myself from being as clear and upfront as I need to be.

02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:31.720
Well, we were about to find out.

02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:47.000
Blair released two apologies, a text version and a video copy, the text version coming on the 15th

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:51.480
of October, and the upload coming approximately a fortnight later. I assume this was because some

02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:55.320
had felt the Twitter format was not extensive enough in the audience that it would reach,

02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:59.160
because as themes go, neither diverge too much from the counterpart's core message.

02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:03.560
She made a mistake, a fundamental shortcoming in research, she never published it with the intent

02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:07.880
of deceiving anyone, and that since she had become conscious to these failings, and now has been

02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:12.120
taking the steps to resolve the situation with Janae, transferring the AdSense money she had made

02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:16.680
from the video after it had been deleted. With that said, there are a couple curious observations

02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:21.800
that one can make on closer analysis. I've always found the, unlike many trans athletes, a rather

02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:26.120
strange comment. I'm not entirely sure what the intention of that interjection was, whether it was

02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:30.840
to shoehorn in a political point, or to try and make sense of her misguided assumption. Regardless,

02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:35.960
there's no way Blair would know how many trans athletes compete against cis-athletes, or if it's a

02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:41.000
majority, but anyhow, the main issue is actually buying her response that she could have sincerely

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:46.520
missed this information when it was readily available to her, but she at least admitted it was sloppy.

02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:51.080
In the text post, she announced the hiatus, which is formally concluded with her video, so she had

02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:55.800
clearly taken a bit of time to refine her thoughts, and provide her viewers with a more lucid reflection

02:01:55.800 --> 02:01:57.080
in certain aspects.

02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:30.440
I actually want to as well, so I'm here to do that. Two weeks ago, I posted a public apology

02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:35.400
to someone that I highlighted in a recent video of mine, which is now taken down. It was a video

02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:39.880
on trans athletes. In this video, I highlighted a couple different trans athletes, and I talked

02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:45.720
about upcoming legislature that's like relevant to the topic, but long story short, one of the

02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:53.240
trans athletes named Janae, I really fumbled her story. I got her all wrong. It is for no other

02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:58.440
reason than my own lack of due diligence and my own lack of sufficient research on her story

02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:03.480
that I said that. I genuinely did think it did not come from a deceptive place. I was under the

02:03:03.480 --> 02:03:07.640
misconception that she competes in both men and women's leagues. She corrected it and said,

02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:13.560
actually, just men's leagues, and to be frank, there is just no excuse for that kind of

02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:19.400
inaccuracy to be present in any of my videos, and I definitely never want it to happen again.

02:03:19.480 --> 02:03:24.200
I took the video down, and I also, once I got paid from YouTube just a couple days ago, I actually

02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:29.480
sent her the totality of the AdSense revenue that I accrued from that video.

02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:34.280
She also explains her delayed response, yielding from her reputation as a bit of a renegade to

02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:39.000
many who chastised her, and how it influenced her perception of the criticism that she was receiving.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:44.280
Also, I know that some people are critical of the delayed response I had when I apologized to Janae,

02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:48.840
and for that, I also have to say I'm sorry. I think the unfortunate thing is it took me

02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:53.720
a lot longer than it should have to differentiate between valid criticism and hate, and it wasn't

02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:57.080
the right thing to do, but I think that for a minute there, I had my blinders on because

02:03:57.080 --> 02:04:02.040
I'm so used to sort of, you know, I do controversial topics on every video,

02:04:02.040 --> 02:04:06.040
so there's always people mad, and I think to a certain extent, I was almost just in this rhythm

02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:09.560
where, like, post a video, people are mad. Post a video, people are mad, but this time,

02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:15.400
obviously, people were mad for a valid reason, and it was always valid, and I should have

02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:19.640
recognized it. However, her reflection appeared to have obscured her memory on other fronts,

02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:23.000
as her JK Rowling ebook had now become a physical copy.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:30.200
Being a long, obnoxiously fake novel of JK Rowling's for research to doing such incredibly

02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:34.600
subpar research on the second video, but I did, and it was dumb, and I am sorry.

02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:38.360
It was slightly ironic that this statement followed after a persistent contention that

02:04:38.360 --> 02:04:42.680
she would not lie intentionally, but I understand why she used this as an example to try and

02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:46.600
emphasize that this was an exception rather than a chronic issue with her content.

02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:50.920
But here's the problem, it does seem to be a chronic issue, and it couldn't be stressed

02:04:50.920 --> 02:04:52.520
more than in this scenario.

02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:59.320
It's just a learning opportunity to implement that in every area of my life, here and in my real life.

02:04:59.320 --> 02:05:03.160
I'm not infallible, I'm most definitely susceptible to getting things wrong,

02:05:03.160 --> 02:05:08.200
and it's really how you respond to it once you do get it wrong that makes all the difference,

02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:09.480
and I totally get that.

02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:14.120
In the context of the video it's presented in, it's a reasonable response, we've all made mistakes,

02:05:14.120 --> 02:05:18.040
we've all made videos we regret in hindsight, content that we would have done differently,

02:05:18.040 --> 02:05:22.040
and for anyone to act holier than thou in such a situation is hardly justified.

02:05:22.040 --> 02:05:26.520
Unfortunately, with the information available on her previous actions that she had simply not addressed

02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:31.400
in the past, it became increasingly hard to fully trust her account, especially with the JK Rowling gaffe

02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:35.800
in mind. It would be easy to read this as her only choosing to respond when she actually faced

02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:40.520
consequences for her inaccuracies. She had lost over 20,000 subscribers by this point,

02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:45.400
and although such a sign may make you more conscious, many more cynical views felt like her hand had been

02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:50.280
forced to save her skin. At the time though, many were simply not aware of this, and welcomed her apology

02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:56.120
with open arms. She didn't necessarily need to make a video statement, so what she provided was a solid step up,

02:05:56.120 --> 02:06:01.640
however not too long after the tides once more began to turn, as the content of those critical of her

02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:07.160
work began to accumulate. However, the fatal blow could be attributed to someone by the name of D'Angelo Wallace.

02:06:07.160 --> 02:06:11.320
The JK Rowling book? How did she say she got it?

02:06:11.320 --> 02:06:14.760
Overnight shipping, a long, obnoxiously thick novel.

02:06:14.760 --> 02:06:18.760
Overnight shipping? But I thought she said in her book review that...

02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:21.800
I spent the last 12 hours reading it as an e-book.

02:06:24.920 --> 02:06:25.960
So she didn't read it.

02:06:25.960 --> 02:06:30.520
D'Angelo Wallace had been mostly known for making videos on subjects primarily involved in more tabloid

02:06:30.520 --> 02:06:35.000
drama up to this point, pretty comprehensively, I'll add, though I'm not going to stroke his ego too much,

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:38.200
as he's probably watching this video right now, so he knows what he does.

02:06:38.200 --> 02:06:43.080
His video on Blair White served in part as a documenting of this pattern of behaviour that we've discussed

02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:47.480
throughout this episode, but also took the time to respond to her admission video, pointing out what a more

02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:52.840
casual viewer may have missed, drawing unparalleled amounts of attention to an abundance of inconsistencies,

02:06:52.840 --> 02:06:57.720
causing many to flood the comment section of the videos with these observations, and swing the like-dislike

02:06:57.720 --> 02:07:00.440
ratio in a much more unfavourable direction.

02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:05.160
Unfortunately, Blair's apology really needed to be flawless to avoid being picked apart by many of those

02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:10.040
who had come out in force against her, and it just wasn't, it was made with a precision similar to the

02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:14.280
videos she was being called out for in the first place, and as more turned their eye towards her,

02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:18.280
Blair's impassioned pleas were gradually being weathered away. However, it didn't stop there,

02:07:18.280 --> 02:07:23.080
because as D'Angelo Wallace's video came out very shortly after Blair's response, its timing meant it

02:07:23.080 --> 02:07:27.960
served almost as a retort in itself, but Wallace nonetheless also took a great amount of time to

02:07:27.960 --> 02:07:30.920
tell his own story. I used to be a huge Blair White fan.

02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:34.840
I personally disagreed with her conservative opinions, but that was never what she really

02:07:34.840 --> 02:07:39.400
centered her content around when it comes to YouTube anyway. I mean, she is a writer for this

02:07:39.400 --> 02:07:43.640
conservative publication called The Post-Millennial, but as far as her videos go,

02:07:43.640 --> 02:07:48.920
she mostly just provides a perspective on things that happen that's alternative to the ones people

02:07:48.920 --> 02:07:54.280
typically run with, and I found that fascinating. What I'm trying to say here basically is I was

02:07:54.280 --> 02:07:59.000
super transphobic when I was watching her content. I'm not saying, oh, I was raised this way or I

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:05.560
didn't know. I legitimately believed that trans people were irrational unless they were exactly

02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:11.560
like Blair White, and that's insane. His upload spanning just over an hour addresses

02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:16.040
his parasocial relationship with the creator in question and deconstructs her appeal as a

02:08:16.040 --> 02:08:20.840
supposedly transgender spokesperson for the community, ravaging the fabric of many of her

02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:25.400
principles and asserting that much of her content was built on belittling other trans people who

02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:31.160
didn't match up to her standards. Or the one thing here, it's this entire pattern, and now when I

02:08:31.160 --> 02:08:36.360
think about the fact that she's gone after somebody like Janai Marie Kroc, who absolutely

02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:42.120
fits the description of being non-binary and says so, I'm nearly positive that Blair White has done

02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:47.080
this on purpose, because it's what she's always done since 2016, is try to make these people look

02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:51.240
bad so Blair can feel better. This not just shifted focus towards the inconsistencies in

02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:55.400
Blair's content, but also towards what many found in her, particularly those who may have placed her

02:08:55.400 --> 02:09:00.360
on a pedestal previously. Sure, she had always branded herself as problematic, but I think many

02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:04.760
still held her in higher regard than the light that a lot of these negative videos cast her in,

02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:09.400
even the ethos of her predator exposes were brought into contention. All of a sudden,

02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:13.800
the significance of her apology video was dwarfed by something greater, the issue of whether her

02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:18.280
content had been tainted by the same toxicity that had been illuminated in this debacle.

02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:23.240
D'Angelo would argue so, but was that the entire story? Well, let's talk about it.

02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:57.080
D'Angelo approached Blair White from the perspective of a former viewer,

02:09:57.080 --> 02:10:01.240
and even supporter of Blair, and this created a case that was very compelling in itself.

02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:05.880
In part two, I wanna look at Blair Wright's track record of mistakes, and what they say about the

02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:10.440
kind of person that she is on YouTube, and I wanna do this from the perspective of a former fan.

02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:14.360
His video walked us through the process of realization, many of which he had only come

02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:18.840
to understand himself somewhat recently, being told with a harsh sense of self-reflection,

02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:23.240
and consequently provoking the question for more conscientious audience members who may hold their

02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:27.880
creators to high account. The fact that he doesn't pull any punches against his own past self means

02:10:27.880 --> 02:10:31.880
that he does not need to compromise on his own presentation of Blair. I mentioned earlier that

02:10:31.880 --> 02:10:35.880
I used to be a pretty big fan of Blair White, but when I stopped watching her, I didn't just

02:10:35.880 --> 02:10:42.280
unsubscribe. I stopped and questioned myself, and had to evaluate why I was ever subscribed

02:10:42.280 --> 02:10:45.880
in the first place. I could claim that it was just because I wanted to hear the opinions of

02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:50.760
a trans person, but if anything has become clear by now, there are much better people on the

02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:54.680
platform who can speak up for their trans experiences. This personal connection with

02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:58.280
D'Angelo reached Blair White viewers who themselves were prone to disillusionment,

02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:02.280
and as people began to experience this epiphany through the lens that Wallace presented,

02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:07.080
some decided to make known their dissatisfaction by using the only physically tangible method they

02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:11.320
have beyond likes and comments, taking up their qualms with the unsubscribe button.

02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:14.840
In the comment section, beyond the many expressing shock at some of Blair's actions,

02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:19.080
others wrote to confess that they themselves had been won over by her rhetoric without considering

02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:23.960
it seriously. It seems that D'Angelo's message had effectively broken through, but why though?

02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:28.120
After all, much of what she was being called out for was hardly surprising, and the catalyst

02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:32.360
for all this hullabaloo was a research error that most would probably feel isn't worth crucifying

02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:35.960
someone over. Hell, it wouldn't necessarily change their viewpoint as long as there were

02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:40.920
grounds for it to still exist, which as noted, there was. And on her offensive content, well…

02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:46.280
I know that casually saying the N-word with the hard R means you're definitely racist.

02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:09.320
I didn't see her address those in the truth about my racist past video.

02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:13.080
Go back a few years and you had one of the most prominent commentators on YouTube arguing that

02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:16.760
slurs were completely acceptable, and whether you like that or not, the truth is that it's

02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:21.320
not a deal breaker for a lot of audiences. So beyond this and D'Angelo's ability to relate

02:12:21.320 --> 02:12:25.640
feelings and responsibility to those watching, how did this video show Blair up to the point

02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:28.840
where she was hemorrhaging subscribers faster than she was before?

02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:34.920
I really do feel as though this is sort of a very simple natural consequence of sort of

02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:39.960
the entirety of the trans community, their activists and the Wokeys as we call them,

02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:44.600
really plugging in their ears at every ounce of evidence that people are constantly trying to

02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:49.240
give them that like, look, it's not about hating trans people. It's not about like having horrible

02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:55.400
feelings towards them. It's literally just this isn't fair and it's obvious. Can you guys please

02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:59.640
address this? And they just don't. Well, I think it comes back to the root theory, not just

02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:04.280
regarding her videos, but herself as a whole. She bases a lot of her assertive persona on the

02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:08.760
stances she takes and the fact that she has a grasp on them. She walked that balance of being

02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:13.640
the outspoken person who isn't afraid to say it as she sees it. But if that's not how she actually

02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:18.360
sees it, if her vision is that obfuscated, what grounds does she have to say it? How can you

02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:24.040
justify all the jibes and snarky comments without the grounds? At that point, you risk reducing

02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:28.280
yourself to an edgelord with no greater purpose than to stir the pot. People questioned how she

02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:33.080
could sincerely hold the beliefs if she wouldn't properly evidence them. On a more serious note,

02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:36.920
many felt with the misinformation that she purported, this could lead to false beliefs

02:13:36.920 --> 02:13:41.240
being held about marginalized groups that may drive bigotry and discrimination. This also

02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:45.320
compromises elements of her demeanor, because when you reverse the logic, you realize that

02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:49.160
everyone she has characterized as being unreasonable activists who hated her because

02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:53.640
she was spit in facts may have actually just been critics who were irked by the alleged mistruths

02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:59.400
propagated in her content, and her status as this pariah becomes much more apt. The shoe is on the

02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:16.520
other foot now. And what could Blair say to this? Well, to be honest, it was a very rough

02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:20.680
predicament given she had already admitted to making a mistake. Creators were free to draw

02:14:20.680 --> 02:14:24.840
their own conclusions from it if they were well evidenced. She could respond, but it would risk

02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:29.320
prolonging the turmoil that she was already going through, and possibly inflicting more losses onto

02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:34.120
herself. Unless she had some receipts to turn the situation on its head, it wasn't worth the hassle,

02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:39.160
so she moved on to calling out a mossy who is completely deserving of being called out. Of course,

02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:43.320
she had to make the point that no one else was talking about it, other than these people, of course,

02:14:43.320 --> 02:14:47.640
but that's just the clickbait game. The video itself is fine, but with that shadow still over her,

02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:52.680
it seemed that much of the momentum that she had was now against her, with a gross subscriber loss

02:14:52.680 --> 02:14:57.800
of over 70,000. Some may ponder if that is truly fair on someone who hasn't done anything of the

02:14:57.800 --> 02:15:02.440
scale and consequence of some that we have given air time on this channel before, but at that point

02:15:02.440 --> 02:15:07.080
she had been charged with a crime of influence. In my opinion, Blair White is the most irrational

02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:12.120
one out of them all, and it's not because she's transgender or for any reason other than the fact

02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:17.400
that she is a liar who wants to manipulate the emotions of the whole world into becoming evidence

02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:21.560
for something that she knows isn't true. I'm not saying she was being persecuted here for having

02:15:21.560 --> 02:15:26.120
unbiased opinions, it was a greater point claiming that she was either being unbelievably reckless

02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:30.680
with her platform, or that she was just an outwardly bad actor, and that convinced many

02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:34.760
to withdraw their support. It was difficult to argue against it with the volume of evidence

02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:38.680
available, and I think the most disheartening fact was the revelation that very little had changed

02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:43.160
over the years which had passed, even if it was presented under a different guise. Blair had

02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:47.800
gravitated from the outdated cliques of certain viewpoints of 2016, and the trouble they would

02:15:47.800 --> 02:15:51.960
often instigate, which was great. However, this ultimately worked against Blair because whereas

02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:56.440
in past situations, such as the Riley Dennis case, the behaviour could be chalked up to certain

02:15:56.440 --> 02:16:00.840
communities and environmental factors causing her perception to be coloured, it became apparent to

02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:06.040
many that these shenanigans transcended external variables. Even as she moved into the mainstream

02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:11.160
eye, she perpetuated a lot of these issues. Even as some had warned her, and called her out,

02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:16.600
she had time to fix this, and ultimately it was a Blair White problem, which is why she suffered

02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:22.200
to the extent she did, and why videos like D'Angelo's hit as hard as they did. As a matter

02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:27.400
of fact, many commentators had clearly cottoned onto this, because they were all choosing to come

02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:32.600
up with their own hypotheses for what personal motives drove Blair to act in this way, latching

02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:37.880
onto the examples of invalidation, to push another fairly common hypothesis we'd previously considered,

02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:40.040
the good transgender person.

02:16:40.040 --> 02:16:44.520
I cannot even tell you the thousands of emails, thousands of comments that I got from people

02:16:44.520 --> 02:16:49.240
who had literally no understanding of trans people before that Jessica Yaneef story,

02:16:49.240 --> 02:16:53.640
and when they saw my video calling it out, and they realized that I'm trans calling it out,

02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:59.880
their perspective was changed 1000%. And suddenly they realized, I shouldn't have painted an entire

02:16:59.880 --> 02:17:04.280
community with that brush, and this girl seems normal, this girl's cool, and that was what

02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:10.120
happened. Like, no, there are normal trans people out there who don't believe all these radical things.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:15.880
However, this only really addresses a personal philosophy that may drive certain aspects of her

02:17:15.880 --> 02:17:20.760
beliefs, and risks overlooking the actual conduct that landed her in this jam in the first place.

02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:25.640
It's a jump that ignores a few steps, and I'd like to take a moment to step over them myself,

02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:29.960
as I do believe there was a bit of disparity in what people actually believed here.

02:17:34.280 --> 02:17:47.960
Do not fear, we'll cross the bridge of what Blair's personal philosophy precipitates when we reach it.

02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:52.360
Beyond the fact that it is of course just theory, whether well backed up or not, I'm sure there are a few

02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:57.240
people who likely feel the way that Blair does, yet for some reason they haven't ended up in the public

02:17:57.240 --> 02:18:02.520
quagmire for peddling misinformation on the internet. Blaming that solely on what Blair believes seems

02:18:02.520 --> 02:18:08.440
somewhat insubstantial. Misinformation comes down to, more fundamentally, two explanations, negligence,

02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:13.560
or malice, or both, maybe, who knows. Some would be inclined to say that this is a case of negligence,

02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:18.360
that's what Blair herself said, as a matter of fact, she actually alludes to it in her video, making this

02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:19.840
bold claim in her defence.

02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:29.320
While I know some people think this was intentional deception on my part, I can guarantee you this is not the

02:18:29.320 --> 02:18:35.960
case. Lying about something that the public can then go correct you on is only slightly more dumb than

02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:41.160
not doing enough research and coming to a false conclusion, and it was a really dumb moment on my part,

02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:46.760
and I'm not taking away from that, but I also would like it to be known that it was not malicious intent,

02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:49.240
or something that was intentional.

02:18:51.240 --> 02:18:56.120
Now, on paper, it's not like this doesn't hold water, it would be incredibly counterproductive for her to

02:18:56.200 --> 02:19:01.160
intentionally spout falsified content when she was already under scrutiny. There were other examples that

02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:05.480
would have been more appropriate, examples she had referenced in the past herself. To some, maybe Blair's

02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:10.840
biases had finally conquered her, she went into the video with a perspective first, and didn't pay mind to any

02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:15.320
information that would actually counter this, and could have easily prevented this faux-puck, it wouldn't have

02:19:15.320 --> 02:19:20.760
been difficult to find a new subject and uphold her point of view, right? Well, I suppose it depends on what

02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:25.480
point you believe she's trying to make. This is where we can reintroduce the point that many were articulating,

02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:29.960
that she'd like to make an example out of those trans people who didn't look like her, and in many ways,

02:19:29.960 --> 02:19:32.040
the upload in question was no exception.

02:19:32.040 --> 02:19:35.800
Jenna- I'm not making fun of her appearance, I mean, I think that obviously her appearance is outlandish,

02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:41.080
and I think that even she would admit that, because how could she not? But that's not the point, the bigger point is...

02:19:41.080 --> 02:19:45.480
This was one of the comments that many harped on when criticising her, it felt like she was going after an

02:19:45.480 --> 02:19:50.840
individual on the basis that a person did not appear as orthodox as she did, and this is what motivated her

02:19:50.840 --> 02:19:55.400
to single out Jenna. Was this enough for her to discount information that would serve to the contrary?

02:19:55.400 --> 02:20:00.440
Well, some would argue that as well, especially given only the video before, many believed that she had lied

02:20:00.440 --> 02:20:05.240
about reading a book she never did, especially given it was a lie that she subsequently repeated in a video

02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:11.000
where she expressed remorse. If lying was easy, then how could we trust her intent on any other front?

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:16.280
Well, the truth is that you can't, but does that definitively mean that it was an act of malice?

02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:21.000
You see, her comments about JK Rowling's book was definitely one to bolster her credibility,

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:26.440
and likely views as well. It was daft, and would justifiably prompt one to question the integrity of future

02:20:26.440 --> 02:20:31.480
comments about her tenacity. However, this is mostly a disposable comment, which although she shouldn't have

02:20:31.480 --> 02:20:36.280
made, also wouldn't have had the greatest implications whether she had actually read the book or not.

02:20:36.280 --> 02:20:41.400
In fact, if she had her facts straight, nobody would have any reason to disbelieve that she read the book,

02:20:41.400 --> 02:20:46.680
even if she didn't. It's easy to make an aside comment to try and outperform fellow commentators

02:20:46.680 --> 02:20:50.920
in the algorithm. That doesn't mean you're capable of knowingly twisting information about other people

02:20:50.920 --> 02:20:55.880
that could, in reality, be borderline defamatory. However, you could also respond to this by saying

02:20:55.880 --> 02:21:00.520
that Blair had been called out for this behaviour on a continuous basis. There are more than ample

02:21:00.520 --> 02:21:04.920
warning signs that her research was not sufficient, and that she would regularly either dismiss this

02:21:04.920 --> 02:21:09.720
criticism, or sweep it under the rug. Now, to be honest, I wouldn't necessarily expect her to address

02:21:09.720 --> 02:21:14.840
every individual mistake, when she wasn't the only person who fell foul to fake news. However, the fact

02:21:14.840 --> 02:21:19.480
that she clearly was aware of certain incidents and reacted to them, such as the drag queen one,

02:21:19.480 --> 02:21:24.280
for example, should have been an indicator that she needed to tread more carefully, but it never felt

02:21:24.280 --> 02:21:29.080
like she did, and that made it much harder to defend her. However, the question still begged,

02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:35.000
what did Blair really have to gain from being so intentionally dishonest? Well, I guess the obvious

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:39.400
one would be clout from pandering to an audience's ideology. In the case of some creators, they'll

02:21:39.400 --> 02:21:44.040
find a niche, realise they're somewhat limited in their scope, and begin twisting or stretching

02:21:44.040 --> 02:21:48.680
stories to their audience tastes, even if that means not being completely transparent. There are

02:21:48.680 --> 02:21:53.160
some cases where it feels like Blair did this, such as the Trump hat in Hollywood. However, by

02:21:53.160 --> 02:21:57.800
2020, I wouldn't say that her audience had a collective credo, and she could have easily taken

02:21:57.800 --> 02:22:02.360
a more moderate standpoint, and not been strung up. She'd done that before with the transgender

02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:07.080
bathroom issue, and not been criticised, so it does point to something personal, and arguably

02:22:07.080 --> 02:22:11.960
possibly the most malicious explanation. The idea that Blair was trying to indoctrinate her viewers,

02:22:11.960 --> 02:22:17.000
using content calling out predators to advance her moral standing, and then capitalising on that with

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:21.560
dangerously slanted opinion pieces based off dubious sources that she knew wasn't the case.

02:22:21.560 --> 02:22:26.360
This would indeed be a very ruinous portrait, and would certainly explain at least a fair majority

02:22:26.360 --> 02:22:31.240
of what we've discussed. However, it is also based on assumptions whose verity we can't be certain

02:22:31.240 --> 02:22:36.280
of. It goes on the pivotal assumption that Blair knew she was lying in each of the stories, which

02:22:36.280 --> 02:22:38.920
although plausible, is not the sole explanation.

02:22:44.920 --> 02:22:49.800
You can say a lot of things about me, and I know I'm messy. I'm a messy ass b****, this is nothing new,

02:22:49.800 --> 02:22:53.560
everyone who knows me knows it, everyone who doesn't know me but hears about me knows it, it's true.

02:22:54.840 --> 02:22:59.880
Many of Blair White's videos emanated the high school goss energy, and Blair's demeanour similarly

02:22:59.880 --> 02:23:04.360
matched that. She never appeared to be openly vitriolic towards anyone, but she constantly

02:23:04.360 --> 02:23:09.160
walked the line very precariously, blurring the boundaries between idle minded errors and

02:23:09.160 --> 02:23:14.360
intentional manipulation. The failure to provide proper information and omit a lot of relevant facts

02:23:14.360 --> 02:23:19.320
appeared to be a result of laziness of research, and the fact that she based a lot of her material

02:23:19.320 --> 02:23:24.840
off other creators who were also heavily biased. She'd come in with her own preconceived narratives,

02:23:24.840 --> 02:23:29.560
and not question the intent. Her controversies often showed her as being impulsive, petty,

02:23:29.560 --> 02:23:35.080
and in a way self-interested, but not really in a particularly calculated manner. To paraphrase

02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:39.400
Blair a bit more unflatteringly, one would expect a person to be a bit smarter if they

02:23:39.400 --> 02:23:43.880
really wanted to take advantage of their audience in such a way. I'd say the greatest lie that Blair

02:23:43.880 --> 02:23:48.440
has maintained is this idea that she is some high research creator who is working behind the scenes,

02:23:48.440 --> 02:23:53.480
when really she's just a T-Youtube who talks politics. With that said, there were other situations

02:23:53.480 --> 02:23:57.720
such as certain response videos where it became very hard to believe that she'd missed information,

02:23:57.720 --> 02:24:01.720
or cases where it seemed she was presenting slanted points of view. The fact that she leaves

02:24:01.720 --> 02:24:06.920
next to no references means that people can't fact check her as easily, and may make one question

02:24:06.920 --> 02:24:13.000
why she does it. Maybe she knows her sources are a bit unreliable. More importantly though, this is

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:17.480
why Blair's biases have come to the forefront of her content in the first place. Otherwise,

02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:21.880
no one would really be able to challenge her opinions too deeply, provided they felt like

02:24:21.880 --> 02:24:26.200
they were properly derived from the actual observations that could be made. Too many times,

02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:30.600
her opinions led the videos rather than the subjects themselves, and that was a detriment

02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:35.000
to her and those that she spoke about. We know what these opinions are at this stage,

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:39.080
but what can be said beyond that? Well, let's go there now.

02:24:43.960 --> 02:24:48.280
As said, I've never watched Blair White routinely, but I know a fair few people who have, and one of

02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:51.880
the recurring comments that stopped them from watching her was the fact that her takes became

02:24:51.880 --> 02:24:55.720
predictable. This is never a good trait to attribute to a creator, but I think it's worse

02:24:55.720 --> 02:24:59.720
when you're dealing with information that is warped to suit your predictability. As the years

02:24:59.720 --> 02:25:04.120
passed, and she became more mainstream, she may have changed, but not necessarily in a way that

02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:07.960
rectified the previous issues that she'd been called out for. As a matter of fact,

02:25:07.960 --> 02:25:12.760
you could harken back to one early video that clearly reflects her core views to this day.

02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:16.840
So I think this meme pretty much sums up how I feel, but I will go into more detail.

02:25:20.440 --> 02:25:24.440
So yeah, I think all these identities are largely bullshit. I think they're super arbitrary,

02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:29.960
I think they're super meaningless, I think people who take them on are usually extremely boring,

02:25:29.960 --> 02:25:36.280
and have nothing else for their personality other than I'm demi-queer, non-binary, genderfuck,

02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:42.520
special snowflake kin. This mostly unsubstantiated idea that many of the people she railed against in

02:25:42.520 --> 02:25:47.160
certain scenarios were concocting their gender identities for attention, and you know, on the

02:25:47.160 --> 02:25:52.200
internet, sure, there are people who go to extreme measures in certain communities, but many of the

02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:56.760
people she would go on to subsequently make an example of, were not people who she had any way

02:25:56.760 --> 02:26:01.960
of backing up such a claim, other than her own prejudices. In her first ever upload, during her

02:26:01.960 --> 02:26:06.600
brief anti-feminist phase, she talks about the differences between how men and women are treated

02:26:06.600 --> 02:26:11.400
in society. She does reference some evidence-based arguments, but as we noted, talks about her

02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:12.920
personal experience as well.

02:26:13.560 --> 02:26:18.680
The term ladies first is definitely something that's actually implemented, it's not just a phrase,

02:26:18.920 --> 02:26:24.920
and while these are sort of frivolous examples, I do think there's something worth noting about the

02:26:24.920 --> 02:26:31.080
quality of life that women experience based on operating through a society that's just kinder to

02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:36.920
them, that's just more polite to them, that's just more welcoming of them.

02:26:36.920 --> 02:26:42.280
It's curious because those she has most vitriol towards, in many ways, are the people who are already

02:26:42.280 --> 02:26:46.440
receiving a lot of stigma from the communities that surround them, and if you are to consider how

02:26:46.520 --> 02:26:51.080
society treats you on a personal level as a form of privilege, then many of the people that blare her

02:26:51.080 --> 02:26:56.120
ranks are some of the most alienated in society, whether that was the transgender women who struggled

02:26:56.120 --> 02:27:01.080
to pass, or non-binary people who identify in a way that is contrary to traditional gender roles.

02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:06.040
So to pose the question, why would these people act in ways that are attention seeking if there is so

02:27:06.040 --> 02:27:10.920
little to prospectively gain, and who are we to say beyond a shadow of a doubt those are acting in

02:27:10.920 --> 02:27:15.480
such a way regardless, unless there is serious evidence to prove it? The other point that Blair

02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:19.320
would regularly advocate is the one that she doesn't want to be thrown under an umbrella with

02:27:19.320 --> 02:27:22.920
certain individuals who may not have shared similar experiences that one would consider

02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:26.600
inclusive of what she feels constitutes as transgender.

02:27:26.600 --> 02:27:31.320
What really gets me about that is that there are so many different letters in the LGBT acronym at this point,

02:27:31.320 --> 02:27:35.560
I think we all know it's basically the entire alphabet, plus some numbers, so there's all these

02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:40.680
micro-distinctions, this is this type of person, this is this type of person, this is this type of person,

02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:44.200
but yet for me saying, okay, I'm different than that is a problem.

02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:48.680
She seems highly insecure about the fact that she may also have to share the spotlight with people who

02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:53.480
haven't gone through medical procedures, which I'm sure are highly distressing experiences, and I would

02:27:53.480 --> 02:27:58.200
never take that away from anyone. Nonetheless, anyone who's subjected to additional social stigma

02:27:58.200 --> 02:28:03.000
for not conforming to binaries like Blair does is still another form of suffering, most people would

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:07.800
probably just like to live in peace away from that. When it comes to this issue, Blair says it pretty

02:28:07.800 --> 02:28:09.160
succinctly herself.

02:28:09.320 --> 02:28:14.760
And the goal of trans people is to operate within the binary, as in moving from one to the other.

02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:19.720
She wants to exist within the gender binary, which is good, I'm happy for her. However, it feels like

02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:24.600
she's driven by this slippery slope argument that the transgender community and society as a whole

02:28:24.600 --> 02:28:29.560
will just evolve into this totalitarian civilization where everyone announces their pronouns before

02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:33.400
they initiate a conversation, and those who don't conform will be thrown into the gulag.

02:28:33.400 --> 02:28:38.120
An exaggeration, I'm aware, but she frames it as if many non-binary people are motivated

02:28:38.120 --> 02:28:43.000
to deconstructing the gender binary as we know it, despite the fact that many non-binary people

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:47.720
also identify with traditional gender roles as well. This isn't just the case for non-binary

02:28:47.720 --> 02:28:51.320
people though, this is the problem with Blair's rhetoric in general, and one that reared its head

02:28:51.320 --> 02:28:56.200
again with the Janai Marie Kroc situation, that claim that some fabric of what we're used to is

02:28:56.200 --> 02:29:00.600
going to be lost, and hey, trying to preserve tradition is in part what makes her conservative,

02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:05.080
I understand that. However, it feels like Blair's reaching for bogeymen to raise one's level of

02:29:05.080 --> 02:29:09.800
concern when a lot of the time, a situation is more nuanced than it appears, watering it down

02:29:09.800 --> 02:29:13.960
with notions that she's long established but not necessarily thought to check if it's completely

02:29:13.960 --> 02:29:18.200
relevant to the point that she's making in the first place. Hell, in a video a few uploads after

02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:22.680
a big apology where she responds to a video with a person who identifies as a dog, she falls foul

02:29:22.680 --> 02:29:23.840
to this once more.

02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:29.400
The only thing I know about this before watching it is that this is a trans man who is also a trans dog.

02:29:30.120 --> 02:29:33.400
If you think I'm saying this to make fun of this person, that is not the case, this is literally

02:29:33.400 --> 02:29:37.480
how this person describes themselves, a trans man who also identifies as a dog.

02:29:37.480 --> 02:29:40.040
2020, what's good? Bella, look, it's your cousin.

02:29:42.840 --> 02:29:47.080
The issue is that this person never said they identify as a dog, and a quick watch of the full

02:29:47.080 --> 02:29:49.640
video will show you that this is role play.

02:29:49.640 --> 02:29:57.080
That plays anytime that a person takes on the role of an animal, and they emulate that animal,

02:29:57.080 --> 02:29:59.640
either through their behavior or their actions.

02:29:59.640 --> 02:30:04.200
However, it's put in the original video's title as a bit of clickbait, I suppose, and Blair just

02:30:04.200 --> 02:30:08.840
runs with it without demonstrating any semblance of critical thinking, and playing into the biases

02:30:08.840 --> 02:30:11.240
that she's been known to possess time and time again.

02:30:11.240 --> 02:30:16.120
I identify as a dog thing. I identify as a man and also as a dog thing.

02:30:16.120 --> 02:30:20.520
Like, it makes a mockery of actual trans people, and y'all don't need me to even tell you that.

02:30:20.520 --> 02:30:21.560
Like, y'all know.

02:30:21.560 --> 02:30:28.360
This perfectly feeds into the millions of people on social media just search up the terms I identify

02:30:28.360 --> 02:30:30.440
as. It's like a big joke.

02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:31.480
Like, it's a joke.

02:30:31.480 --> 02:30:32.920
Like, I identify as a helicopter.

02:30:32.920 --> 02:30:35.160
I identify as this phone.

02:30:35.160 --> 02:30:42.360
I identify as this hairbrush, and it adds such an extra layer that the person is actually,

02:30:42.360 --> 02:30:45.160
you know, a trans man, supposedly.

02:30:45.160 --> 02:30:47.320
Like, why are you equating?

02:30:47.320 --> 02:30:49.720
Like, why are you doing that?

02:30:49.720 --> 02:30:52.520
You're blurring lines that I would prefer not to be blurred.

02:30:52.520 --> 02:30:56.840
And here's the thing, with this in mind, I do think the mainstream media mishandles trans issues

02:30:56.840 --> 02:31:00.200
in a way that may provoke some people to be defensive of their identity.

02:31:00.200 --> 02:31:04.600
I've never liked the idea of singular spokespeople for a whole community of extremely diverse

02:31:04.600 --> 02:31:09.000
individuals, and I do think a lot of them take advantage of the shock value that some may provoke,

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:10.600
but you have to see through that.

02:31:10.600 --> 02:31:14.680
The greatest problem is that instead of merely calling out the coverage of a lot of this content

02:31:14.680 --> 02:31:18.760
on these failings, Blair goes one step further, and in a way contradicts herself.

02:31:18.760 --> 02:31:22.680
Now, she does call the mainstream media out sometimes, but then goes on to assume a lot of the

02:31:22.680 --> 02:31:27.720
stories as prototypical, often using them to denigrate other trans identities, whether she

02:31:27.720 --> 02:31:29.000
intends to or not.

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:33.240
However, I think once you establish the fact that a lot of the time, the media and third-party

02:31:33.240 --> 02:31:38.200
sources can be highly unreliable narrators in representing your community, you have to consider

02:31:38.200 --> 02:31:42.120
how they may have changed the perception of the story and where the truth actually lies.

02:31:42.120 --> 02:31:46.360
Blair makes this argument that, to put it quaintly, feels like she's frustrated that the attention

02:31:46.360 --> 02:31:51.000
on certain individuals begins to erase her own lived experience and warp this idea of what the

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:55.320
community is really like, but her response is to try and undermine these people's identities,

02:31:55.320 --> 02:31:59.160
sometimes with the same points that are levied against her community in the first place.

02:31:59.160 --> 02:32:01.240
It's cruel and counterproductive.

02:32:01.240 --> 02:32:04.680
No community is going to represent identical experiences.

02:32:04.680 --> 02:32:08.120
No group of people is even going to share all of them together.

02:32:08.120 --> 02:32:12.840
We are different, and I don't think people in any community should need to compete for validation.

02:32:12.840 --> 02:32:14.440
Does that mean they're the same?

02:32:14.440 --> 02:32:19.400
Of course not, but does that mean that a person can't share a label that many believe to be

02:32:19.400 --> 02:32:20.920
inclusive anyway?

02:32:20.920 --> 02:32:21.480
Hell no.

02:32:21.480 --> 02:32:25.080
I don't think Blair accomplishes anything by putting people down in such a way,

02:32:25.080 --> 02:32:29.640
and the fact that her points aren't well grounded makes her own biases even more blatant.

02:32:29.640 --> 02:32:33.880
Maybe there is more work to be done, but I don't think Blair ever presented a solution,

02:32:33.880 --> 02:32:35.400
and I don't think she's changing.

02:32:35.400 --> 02:32:37.240
But what changes should be made?

02:32:37.240 --> 02:32:41.240
It's easy to sit here and point out the problems, but what's the solution?

02:32:49.400 --> 02:33:00.440
At the start of the video, when I stated that I was at least surprised I found myself on this alongside Blair,

02:33:00.440 --> 02:33:04.200
I guess the shock wasn't just because of what I knew her previously thought,

02:33:04.200 --> 02:33:09.400
but how I recognised the best begrudged ambivalence many critics still held towards her,

02:33:09.400 --> 02:33:12.520
how she was still disliked by a lot of people.

02:33:12.520 --> 02:33:16.680
The issues were still prevalent, and I think it made her position more vulnerable

02:33:16.680 --> 02:33:20.680
given the number of those who looked to her for reasons other than her politics.

02:33:20.680 --> 02:33:25.080
I questioned a lot whether I should make this part in past or present tense,

02:33:25.080 --> 02:33:30.440
given the fact that a lot of it is obviously retrospective, and she has definitely mitigated some of her rhetoric.

02:33:30.440 --> 02:33:34.760
However, Blair has continued to slip up in delivering information, at the time writing,

02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:38.120
most recently with a story about a person by the name of Barbie Kardashian,

02:33:38.120 --> 02:33:40.280
who is worse than Jessica Yaniv.

02:33:40.280 --> 02:33:42.520
Nice little throwback reference there.

02:33:42.600 --> 02:33:47.320
The star of today's video is someone by the name of Barbie Kardashian.

02:33:47.320 --> 02:33:50.520
Yes, this mugshot is real, this is not a creepypasta,

02:33:50.520 --> 02:33:59.080
and this story is probably the most disgusting and disturbing instances of a trans person being put into a women's present,

02:33:59.080 --> 02:34:06.760
and I say trans person in quotations, you will see why this person is basically Jessica Yaniv on steroids,

02:34:06.760 --> 02:34:09.080
I would say on hormones, but that's not the case.

02:34:09.160 --> 02:34:12.920
The video once again circulates information from very slanted websites,

02:34:12.920 --> 02:34:17.640
and doesn't really address the actual situation, including this picture which lacks a source.

02:34:17.640 --> 02:34:21.400
After some reading, I'd say the allegations against the women appear to be true,

02:34:21.400 --> 02:34:26.040
though they're taken from a report which keeps the original individual anonymous, but it adds up.

02:34:26.040 --> 02:34:29.720
The mugshot may be true because the Garda did release one to its officers,

02:34:29.720 --> 02:34:33.720
however, one site just said they obtained it and no one questioned it.

02:34:33.720 --> 02:34:38.120
However, Blair, once again bawling foul to the pseudo-common sense position,

02:34:38.120 --> 02:34:40.680
implies that a take on this matter is the moderate one.

02:34:40.680 --> 02:34:46.600
I think there are problems with both ends of the extreme, and so I'm gonna offer some solutions in this video that are outside of that.

02:34:46.600 --> 02:34:51.960
I know a lot of people, maybe even that are watching this video, are more comfortable with keeping it simple in their minds,

02:34:51.960 --> 02:34:55.720
which, you know, biological sex you're born as, that's what prison you go to,

02:34:55.720 --> 02:35:01.000
and then other people are gonna be more on the extreme of, if this person says they're a woman, they're a woman,

02:35:01.960 --> 02:35:11.400
but these sort of absolutist, extremist positions are what gets us into 99% of the messes we get into in all areas of when it comes to trans people.

02:35:11.400 --> 02:35:19.400
For example, me b****, in their right mind, who would think that if, God forbid, y'all caught me flippin' and convicted me as some kind of crime,

02:35:19.400 --> 02:35:22.440
that I would be best placed into a men's prison.

02:35:22.440 --> 02:35:29.160
Of course, Blair, we should have an independent board which assesses when people are woman enough to be permitted to women's prisons.

02:35:29.320 --> 02:35:30.040
Genius.

02:35:30.040 --> 02:35:35.160
Here's the thing, and in my humble opinion, in part, a reason for why so many people in the past took to Blair,

02:35:35.160 --> 02:35:39.720
I don't think our philosophy is one that is completely alien, particularly in 2016.

02:35:39.720 --> 02:35:44.920
Born out of a frustration at certain institutions, individuals, and their somewhat obnoxious doctrines,

02:35:44.920 --> 02:35:47.720
you see the antics, and it causes a gut reaction.

02:35:47.720 --> 02:35:53.800
A lot of people felt it back then, and some still feel it today, especially when they feel like they're on the receiving end of it.

02:35:53.800 --> 02:35:57.400
There definitely are people out there who make unreasonable demands of those around them,

02:35:57.400 --> 02:36:01.240
some who are far too hostile and unpleasant in trying to pursue their causes,

02:36:01.240 --> 02:36:05.480
and others who I think are too sensitive and far too overreaching in what they try to police.

02:36:05.480 --> 02:36:09.720
Righteousness doesn't always make you right, and I'll be the first to say that.

02:36:09.720 --> 02:36:15.800
I think the issue is that even to this day, a lot of us tend to base our beliefs as a reaction to the environments around us,

02:36:15.800 --> 02:36:17.480
rather than the bigger picture.

02:36:17.480 --> 02:36:20.120
Okay, good. Okay. Well, ask him.

02:36:20.120 --> 02:36:23.320
Get him a check if we're shutting this big ground.

02:36:23.320 --> 02:36:30.120
Now, if you do not listen to her, your event will be shut down right now.

02:36:30.120 --> 02:36:35.160
Right now. Your decision. Make a decision now.

02:36:35.160 --> 02:36:40.680
We will let, we won't, no, we are going to, we are going to let you on the mic.

02:36:40.680 --> 02:36:42.680
Do not silence her.

02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:47.480
Okay. All right. So we are trying to be reasonable.

02:36:47.480 --> 02:36:50.920
We are trying to be reasonable. We are trying to be reasonable.

02:36:53.640 --> 02:36:57.080
We're going to give you, we're going to let you on the mic.

02:36:57.080 --> 02:36:58.520
We are going to give you the mic.

02:36:59.880 --> 02:37:06.200
Well, after Senator Sanders, after Senator Sanders, after Senator Sanders.

02:37:13.400 --> 02:37:20.200
In fact, then, given how someone documented to have been behaving, it made Blair's existence as a creator easier to justify,

02:37:20.200 --> 02:37:24.600
and consequently normalized a lot of the actions that we now reflect on with distaste.

02:37:24.600 --> 02:37:29.880
However, over the years, for a lot of people, it's been about understanding that actually, even if the previous criticisms

02:37:29.880 --> 02:37:35.400
leveled towards certain individuals may be valid, it doesn't mandate complete opposition to them or their ideology.

02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:40.280
In the case of Blair, this sense of closure seems to have been replaced with a greater and greater straw man

02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:45.400
of what these people may collectively want and why it's wrong, despite the fact that there isn't necessarily

02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:49.400
a clear consensus that could easily define their interest beyond acceptance.

02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:54.840
This then leads to certain sweeping statements and comments which may as well be from those on the other side of the aisle.

02:37:54.840 --> 02:37:59.960
I've been there before, trying to fight the middle ground because you see people who claim to speak for your interests

02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:05.560
who don't even want to consider your own opinion as a member of that group, but at the same time arguing for the contrary

02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:08.920
without the conscious recognition of that can be just as destructive.

02:38:08.920 --> 02:38:14.040
I remember uploading a video myself towards the end of 2017 on Riley Dent's when I was in that genre,

02:38:14.040 --> 02:38:20.440
which would be chronologically after Blair had apologized to Riley, and even though I expressed my many disagreements with her,

02:38:20.440 --> 02:38:24.440
the most backlash I received was for actually addressing her as a woman.

02:38:24.440 --> 02:38:29.960
For many in that genre, the damage had already been done, and I think there's a point where you have to recognize

02:38:29.960 --> 02:38:35.400
that when you position yourself against people, you're just playing into the division that you seem so driven to resolve.

02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:41.240
Blair appeared to have that realization herself, but then just regressed back to it, just for a different set of people.

02:38:41.240 --> 02:38:49.560
In a way she hasn't changed, she just goes after people who are indisputably terrible, and uses it to indirectly demean their trans identity instead,

02:38:49.560 --> 02:38:52.760
and sometimes she just doesn't even go after people who are terrible anyway.

02:38:52.760 --> 02:38:59.000
In 2020, the year where I think everyone was just about tired of smoke and mirrors, the extremes we were being drew into,

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:04.360
Blair may have been looked towards as a saving grace, but I think it ultimately led to her position being unraveled

02:39:04.360 --> 02:39:10.360
because people had enough. Those who didn't believe her position as the creator standing up for common sense was legitimate.

02:39:10.360 --> 02:39:16.680
Common sense isn't built on one's sense of centrism or compromise, it's built on a philosophy that values information,

02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:21.640
research, and rigorous discourse, whether that leads to positions that are left or right wing.

02:39:21.640 --> 02:39:27.720
And that's the thing, anyone could go over Blair's videos, pick apart every time she's wrong, every time she's been reckless,

02:39:27.720 --> 02:39:33.640
or irresponsible, reprimand her, but that wouldn't make you better than her, and it certainly doesn't make me better than her.

02:39:33.720 --> 02:39:39.880
Everyone fucks up. The difference is that Blair's problem is one that fundamentally underlines her career on YouTube,

02:39:39.880 --> 02:39:46.600
her own philosophy, which is continuously laid more and more bare every time she makes the exact same mistakes.

02:39:46.600 --> 02:39:55.400
It's not a popular opinion, it's not a politically correct opinion, but I've never been one for political correctness, so yeah.

02:39:55.400 --> 02:39:59.400
Back when she started, you could see the potential for the creator that she is today.

02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:05.720
Her channel always felt like a very personal venture, with many videos discussing her experiences and stories.

02:40:05.720 --> 02:40:13.720
However, there were also prevalent flaws which showed her nature to jump to conclusions, and points that felt strained to prove a greater thesis which wasn't always there.

02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:19.160
At the same time, there were definitely reasons to think she could alleviate these, she used some references here and there,

02:40:19.160 --> 02:40:26.360
seemed quite open to discussion, and was definitely part of a greater community which could be partially accountable for the atmosphere that bred certain behaviours.

02:40:26.360 --> 02:40:35.480
Yet, that just hasn't happened. In a way, Blair White is the only YouTuber I've come across who uses less references in her videos now than when she started,

02:40:35.480 --> 02:40:39.160
despite the fact that I'd argue it's more important than any time before.

02:40:39.160 --> 02:40:48.040
Calling out people for heinous actions gives you a greater imperative to justify it, whether other people assume it to be true or not, whether it has been established.

02:40:48.120 --> 02:40:58.440
Also, it's really not missed on me that in recent years, it seems like a really cheap, easy way to get a lot of media attention for celebrities to come out as they, them, and non-binary and trans and all that.

02:40:58.440 --> 02:41:03.240
And of course, it's very convenient to come out as a they, them, because you don't have to actually commit to any sort of transition.

02:41:03.240 --> 02:41:12.200
Courtney Stodden, Sam Smith, the guy from Queer Eye whose name I can't remember, the one who looks like Jesus, the actor we talked about earlier with Tree and Tree Self,

02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:21.720
I'm literally just so many more I can't even think of, and I'm not saying every single one of them is disingenuine, but like, it's a little too convenient that it's just one after another, after another, after another,

02:41:21.720 --> 02:41:27.560
when you know that if this was 2014 or 2013 before this was even a trend, they would not be coming out.

02:41:27.560 --> 02:41:33.960
Given the fact that the only real influential variable that has remained consistent is that personal sentiment she appears to possess,

02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:40.840
many people feel that she is attempting to separate herself in a way to obtain acceptance from those who may be more skeptical of certain identities.

02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:47.560
If that's how she personally feels, then I can't take that away from her, but it's not how you run a channel that claims to be bridging the divide,

02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:50.880
given how much her personal sentiments surface in those videos.

02:41:50.880 --> 02:41:56.960
I don't think society is a negotiation table where you bargain who's going to be accepted to satisfy the most individuals.

02:41:56.960 --> 02:42:01.040
In the grand scheme of things, that's not moderation to me, it's appeasement.

02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:05.320
Moderation isn't only about what opinions you have, though it does influence it.

02:42:05.320 --> 02:42:10.120
It is a state of mind, and on too many occasions, Blair failed to exercise it.

02:42:10.120 --> 02:42:15.680
I wouldn't care if you were a conservative, liberal, or progressive, that stands independently to me.

02:42:15.680 --> 02:42:19.960
That duty couldn't be more valuable, as Blair had soon warned herself into the mainstream.

02:42:19.960 --> 02:42:26.480
People wanted that recognition of nuance, that attention to detail, the moral obligation, but they didn't find it,

02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:31.800
because Blair's opinions often didn't extend in a way that went beyond counter-cultural conservatism.

02:42:31.800 --> 02:42:36.880
That whole counter-culture position never felt like it had too many beliefs to stand on on its own merit,

02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:41.320
and you can only be against so many people before those around you wonder what you're really for.

02:42:41.320 --> 02:42:47.280
If you don't back up your positions, then what reason do people have to trust you over those you paint as the extremists,

02:42:47.280 --> 02:42:49.960
some of whom hardly have the most extreme views?

02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:57.520
If Blair wants to give us moderation, she has to represent the other side, rather than just her response to assumed absolutists.

02:42:57.720 --> 02:43:03.400
There is a discussion about trans people, included or excluded from it, and what is the right way to navigate, right?

02:43:03.400 --> 02:43:08.280
And my friend and I both agree that the trans community, as it stands now, will never achieve full acceptance,

02:43:08.280 --> 02:43:16.880
and how we've almost noticed an uptick in, like, anti-trans people, and almost like a resurgence of people

02:43:16.880 --> 02:43:23.000
who, like, straight up don't like trans people, don't get it, are very turned off by the community and by trans ideology,

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:26.040
and then actually lash out at us, like, in an anti-trans way.

02:43:26.080 --> 02:43:31.800
As many other creators have already observed, there are other individuals who cover a variety of trans issues in a balanced

02:43:31.800 --> 02:43:38.600
and detailed way, and in much more depth, some of whom have gone to lengths in the past to correct some of Blair's shortcomings.

02:43:38.600 --> 02:43:43.560
I don't think this means that Blair's perhaps lightweight content should be banished from the platform,

02:43:43.560 --> 02:43:50.120
but I think it also has to be done with perspective for what it represents, and at least with an active effort to distinguish

02:43:50.120 --> 02:43:55.560
at what point should be drawn from such an upload. Otherwise, people give it too much consequence in what it could say

02:43:55.560 --> 02:44:01.080
about communities, and she needs to be more mindful when dealing with the topics that do carry that substance.

02:44:01.080 --> 02:44:06.600
Blair needs to be more sensitive on that front, whether she wants to pertain that nonchalant brazen attitude or not.

02:44:06.600 --> 02:44:10.840
She's still a creator who takes themselves seriously enough to make videos about online scoundrels,

02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:15.560
alongside some pretty strong words. These things have consequence.

02:44:15.560 --> 02:44:22.280
But sometimes things just cross the line, and on several occasions, I cross the line, and I'm sorry.

02:44:22.280 --> 02:44:25.880
We've all learned the hard way, but we own it, and we work out how to improve.

02:44:25.880 --> 02:44:31.320
Yet, over the years, the changes to Blair's channel feel cosmetic, made to present the feeling of progression,

02:44:31.320 --> 02:44:37.960
some apologies, some alleged reconciliation, but you strip away the makeup, and it's the same foundation that it was before.

02:44:37.960 --> 02:44:44.120
And as the internet changed, those flaws became clear. Makeup is temporary, what's underneath is permanent.

02:44:44.120 --> 02:44:48.200
And I'll make this clear, I think Blair is far from the worst political creator on YouTube,

02:44:48.200 --> 02:44:53.800
but she suffered the most because she played the riskiest game, her audience held her in very high regard.

02:44:53.800 --> 02:44:57.960
She appealed to those in the mainstream, some of whom very conscious of their ideas,

02:44:57.960 --> 02:45:03.400
and still piled straw onto the beleaguered camel. A part of me believes that she does hold her beliefs close to her heart,

02:45:03.400 --> 02:45:08.280
because as she said herself, much of her failure to present solid information isn't the best option,

02:45:08.280 --> 02:45:14.040
but she continues to do it, yet a connection to a bygone era that may be worth letting go.

02:45:14.120 --> 02:45:19.000
Through old friends, and new enemies, and the incessant drama, time may have passed,

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:23.720
but she remains ever present, and as she does, I hope she pays these thoughts some consideration.

02:45:23.720 --> 02:45:30.440
The world is changing, and as we move towards 2022, it should be clear that moderation needs to be more than just a buzzword.

02:45:30.440 --> 02:45:36.440
It needs to be backed up, you can't just play both teams, or expect your character will be defined off the back of who you call out alone.

02:45:36.440 --> 02:45:40.120
Blair set a higher bar than she could obtain, and ultimately paid the price for it.

02:45:40.120 --> 02:45:44.840
Whether she'll continue to do so will depend on how she goes forward, I just hope she doesn't go back.

02:45:46.520 --> 02:45:47.240
Thank you.

02:45:51.240 --> 02:45:57.160
So that was the video, and a big thank you as always, a very, very long one, but I hope you enjoyed it nonetheless.

02:45:57.160 --> 02:46:04.040
I want to give big thanks to the editors who have done a fantastic job, I'll be putting all their links in the pinned comment,

02:46:04.040 --> 02:46:08.920
so be sure to check them out if you liked what they did, big shout out to Logan as always, post editing,

02:46:08.920 --> 02:46:15.160
titers have a great work, thanks to Linuski for the music, and Staffo for the thumbnail, just great work all round,

02:46:15.160 --> 02:46:20.120
and I really appreciate everyone who helped out, who watched the video, who gave me their feedback before the release,

02:46:20.120 --> 02:46:25.480
so thank you so much. I also want to give thanks to the artists, they'll be in the pinned comment as well,

02:46:25.480 --> 02:46:29.560
and of course the lovely low patrons, the $10 patrons who will be shown on screen right now,

02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:37.400
but also a special thanks to my $50 patrons, Hypercube, GothCreamPuff, CatEars.jpg, and Esther Padoya,

02:46:37.400 --> 02:46:45.400
what a great set of names we have there, and also a very special thanks to my $100 patrons, Marlowe and Kiel Lomeland,

02:46:45.400 --> 02:46:52.360
I'm not entirely sure how I pronounce that, but you can always message me and give me feedback on that one, Kiel.

02:46:52.480 --> 02:46:59.800
Otherwise, my social medias, I don't really use them, but they're there, and of course the references will be at the bottom of the pinned comments as well,

02:46:59.800 --> 02:47:03.880
in case you want to check out the links for yourself. Big thanks again to everyone who helped out,

02:47:03.880 --> 02:47:09.960
much love to everyone who supported me, I know uploads have been a bit slow, but hopefully they can return to a decent pace soon,

02:47:09.960 --> 02:47:16.760
though I doubt this will be the last slightly contentious topic that I'll be covering, so get ready for some vigorous debate at least.

02:47:16.800 --> 02:47:25.880
I don't really have too much else to say, so I'll wrap it up there, thank you again all for your support on this monster of a video if you made it to this part where I just talk randomly,

02:47:25.880 --> 02:47:32.040
thank you everyone, take care, take care, I'm The Right Opinion, and I will see you in the next one.

02:47:46.760 --> 02:47:50.760
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
