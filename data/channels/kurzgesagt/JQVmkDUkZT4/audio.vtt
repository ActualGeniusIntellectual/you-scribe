00:00.000 --> 00:08.800
Are you your body? Well, kind of, right? But is there a line where this stops being true?

00:08.800 --> 00:13.380
How much of yourself can you remove before you stop being you?

00:13.380 --> 00:26.320
And does the question even make sense?

00:26.320 --> 00:31.640
Your physical existence is cells, trillions of them, at least ten times more than there

00:31.640 --> 00:38.800
are stars in the Milky Way. A cell is a living being, a machine made of up to 50,000 different

00:38.800 --> 00:46.040
proteins. It has no consciousness, no will, no purpose, it just is. But it is still an

00:46.040 --> 00:52.600
individual. Together, your cells form huge structures for jobs like preparing food, gathering

00:52.600 --> 00:59.020
resources, transporting stuff around, scanning the environment, and so on. If you extract

00:59.020 --> 01:03.580
cells from your body and put them in the right environment, they will continue to stay alive

01:03.580 --> 01:11.260
for a while. So, your cells can exist without you. But you can't exist without them. If

01:11.260 --> 01:17.520
we take all the cells away, there is no you anymore. Is there a line where a pile of your

01:17.520 --> 01:23.500
cells stops being you? For example, if you donate an organ, billions of your cells will

01:23.500 --> 01:28.720
continue to live on inside someone else. Does this mean that a part of you became a part

01:28.720 --> 01:35.940
of another person? Or, is this other body keeping a part of you alive? Or let us imagine

01:35.940 --> 01:42.120
an experiment. You and a random person from the street exchange cells. One at a time,

01:42.120 --> 01:46.940
your body gets one of their cells, their body gets one of your cells, at which point would

01:46.940 --> 01:53.200
they become you? Would they ever? Or is this just a very slow and gross way to teleport

01:53.200 --> 02:00.320
you? Let's make this more complicated. The image of ourselves as a static thing is untenable.

02:00.320 --> 02:06.420
Almost all of your cells have to die during your lifetime. 250 million have died since

02:06.420 --> 02:13.280
the beginning of this video alone. Between one and three million per second. In a seven

02:13.280 --> 02:19.840
year period, most of your cells are replaced at least once. Every time your cell set up

02:19.840 --> 02:26.420
changes, you are slightly different than before. So a part of you is dying constantly. If you

02:26.420 --> 02:32.760
are lucky enough to become old, you will have cycled through roughly a million billion cells.

02:32.760 --> 02:39.400
So what you consider yourself is really just a snapshot. But sometimes cells are broken

02:39.400 --> 02:44.260
and don't want to die, questioning the very nature of the unity of our bodies. We call

02:44.260 --> 02:51.680
them cancer. They cancel the biological social contract and become basically immortal. Cancer

02:51.680 --> 02:57.140
is not an outside invader. It's a part of you that puts its own survival over yours.

02:57.140 --> 03:01.440
But you could also argue that a cancer cell becomes another entity inside us. Another

03:01.440 --> 03:07.200
being that just wants to thrive and survive. Can we blame it for that? A chilling cell

03:07.200 --> 03:13.440
story is that of Henrietta Lacks, a young cancer patient who died in 1951. Usually,

03:13.440 --> 03:18.920
cells only survived for a few days in the lab, making research very hard. Henrietta's

03:18.920 --> 03:23.800
cancer cells were immortal. Over the decades, they were multiplied over and over again and

03:23.800 --> 03:29.640
used for countless research projects, saving countless lives. Henrietta's cells are still

03:29.640 --> 03:35.560
alive and overall have been grown to at least 20 tons of biomass. So there are living parts

03:35.560 --> 03:40.980
around the world from someone who has been considered dead for decades. How much of Henrietta

03:40.980 --> 03:48.560
is in these cells? What makes one of your cells you anyway? Maybe the information contained

03:48.560 --> 03:54.320
in it, your DNA. Until recently, it was believed that all the cells in your body had basically

03:54.320 --> 04:01.680
the same genetic code. But it turns out this is wrong. Your genome is mobile, changing

04:01.680 --> 04:06.640
over time through mutations and environmental influences. This is especially the case in

04:06.640 --> 04:12.000
your brain. According to recent discoveries, a single neuron in an adult brain has more

04:12.000 --> 04:17.380
than 1000 mutations in its genetic code that are not present in the cells surrounding it.

04:17.380 --> 04:23.920
But how much you is your DNA really? About 8% of the human genome is made up of viruses

04:23.920 --> 04:29.560
that once infected our ancestors and merged with us. Mitochondria, power plants of the

04:29.560 --> 04:34.880
cell, once were bacteria that merged with the ancestors of your cells. They still have

04:34.880 --> 04:40.640
their own DNA. An average cell has hundreds of them, hundreds of little things that are

04:40.640 --> 04:48.400
not really human, but they still kind of are. It is confusing. Let's backtrack a bit. We

04:48.400 --> 04:53.240
know that you're made up of trillions of little things made from more little things that are

04:53.240 --> 04:58.640
constantly changing. Together, all those little things are not static, but dynamic. Their

04:58.640 --> 05:05.120
composition and condition is changing constantly. So we might just be a self-sustaining pattern

05:05.120 --> 05:10.680
without clear borders that gained self-awareness at some point, and now has the ability to think

05:10.680 --> 05:17.840
about itself through time and space, but really only exists in this exact very moment. Where did

05:17.840 --> 05:24.160
this pattern start? With your conception? When the first human arose? When life first began

05:24.160 --> 05:29.280
conquering our small planet? Or when the elements that make up your body were forged in a star?

05:29.280 --> 05:36.400
Our human brains evolved to deal with absolutes. The fuzzy borders that make up reality are hard

05:36.400 --> 05:44.960
to grasp. Maybe ideas like beginning and end, life and death, you and me, are really not absolutes,

05:44.960 --> 05:51.760
but ideas belonging to a fluent pattern, a pattern that is lost in this strange and beautiful

05:52.080 --> 05:59.880
universe. The problem of who we are isn't just a question of our cells, but it's also a question

05:59.880 --> 06:06.360
of our minds. Just as our cells can be divided and separated from us, so can our very brains be

06:06.360 --> 06:12.160
divided and separated from us, while still in the skull. Click here to go to my channel and watch

06:12.160 --> 06:19.440
the next part. Okay, so now go watch CGP Grey's video. If you're not yet subscribed to his channel,

06:19.440 --> 06:21.120
you should really change that now.
