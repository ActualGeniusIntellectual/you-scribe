1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,800
Are you your body? Well, kind of, right? But is there a line where this stops being true?

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,380
How much of yourself can you remove before you stop being you?

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:26,320
And does the question even make sense?

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,640
Your physical existence is cells, trillions of them, at least ten times more than there

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:38,800
are stars in the Milky Way. A cell is a living being, a machine made of up to 50,000 different

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:46,040
proteins. It has no consciousness, no will, no purpose, it just is. But it is still an

7
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:52,600
individual. Together, your cells form huge structures for jobs like preparing food, gathering

8
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,020
resources, transporting stuff around, scanning the environment, and so on. If you extract

9
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,580
cells from your body and put them in the right environment, they will continue to stay alive

10
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:11,260
for a while. So, your cells can exist without you. But you can't exist without them. If

11
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:17,520
we take all the cells away, there is no you anymore. Is there a line where a pile of your

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,500
cells stops being you? For example, if you donate an organ, billions of your cells will

13
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,720
continue to live on inside someone else. Does this mean that a part of you became a part

14
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,940
of another person? Or, is this other body keeping a part of you alive? Or let us imagine

15
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:42,120
an experiment. You and a random person from the street exchange cells. One at a time,

16
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,940
your body gets one of their cells, their body gets one of your cells, at which point would

17
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:53,200
they become you? Would they ever? Or is this just a very slow and gross way to teleport

18
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:00,320
you? Let's make this more complicated. The image of ourselves as a static thing is untenable.

19
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,420
Almost all of your cells have to die during your lifetime. 250 million have died since

20
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:13,280
the beginning of this video alone. Between one and three million per second. In a seven

21
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,840
year period, most of your cells are replaced at least once. Every time your cell set up

22
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,420
changes, you are slightly different than before. So a part of you is dying constantly. If you

23
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:32,760
are lucky enough to become old, you will have cycled through roughly a million billion cells.

24
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,400
So what you consider yourself is really just a snapshot. But sometimes cells are broken

25
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,260
and don't want to die, questioning the very nature of the unity of our bodies. We call

26
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:51,680
them cancer. They cancel the biological social contract and become basically immortal. Cancer

27
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,140
is not an outside invader. It's a part of you that puts its own survival over yours.

28
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,440
But you could also argue that a cancer cell becomes another entity inside us. Another

29
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,200
being that just wants to thrive and survive. Can we blame it for that? A chilling cell

30
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,440
story is that of Henrietta Lacks, a young cancer patient who died in 1951. Usually,

31
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,920
cells only survived for a few days in the lab, making research very hard. Henrietta's

32
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,800
cancer cells were immortal. Over the decades, they were multiplied over and over again and

33
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,640
used for countless research projects, saving countless lives. Henrietta's cells are still

34
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,560
alive and overall have been grown to at least 20 tons of biomass. So there are living parts

35
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,980
around the world from someone who has been considered dead for decades. How much of Henrietta

36
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:48,560
is in these cells? What makes one of your cells you anyway? Maybe the information contained

37
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,320
in it, your DNA. Until recently, it was believed that all the cells in your body had basically

38
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:01,680
the same genetic code. But it turns out this is wrong. Your genome is mobile, changing

39
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,640
over time through mutations and environmental influences. This is especially the case in

40
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,000
your brain. According to recent discoveries, a single neuron in an adult brain has more

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,380
than 1000 mutations in its genetic code that are not present in the cells surrounding it.

42
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:23,920
But how much you is your DNA really? About 8% of the human genome is made up of viruses

43
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,560
that once infected our ancestors and merged with us. Mitochondria, power plants of the

44
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,880
cell, once were bacteria that merged with the ancestors of your cells. They still have

45
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,640
their own DNA. An average cell has hundreds of them, hundreds of little things that are

46
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:48,400
not really human, but they still kind of are. It is confusing. Let's backtrack a bit. We

47
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,240
know that you're made up of trillions of little things made from more little things that are

48
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,640
constantly changing. Together, all those little things are not static, but dynamic. Their

49
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:05,120
composition and condition is changing constantly. So we might just be a self-sustaining pattern

50
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,680
without clear borders that gained self-awareness at some point, and now has the ability to think

51
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:17,840
about itself through time and space, but really only exists in this exact very moment. Where did

52
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:24,160
this pattern start? With your conception? When the first human arose? When life first began

53
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,280
conquering our small planet? Or when the elements that make up your body were forged in a star?

54
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:36,400
Our human brains evolved to deal with absolutes. The fuzzy borders that make up reality are hard

55
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:44,960
to grasp. Maybe ideas like beginning and end, life and death, you and me, are really not absolutes,

56
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,760
but ideas belonging to a fluent pattern, a pattern that is lost in this strange and beautiful

57
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:59,880
universe. The problem of who we are isn't just a question of our cells, but it's also a question

58
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:06,360
of our minds. Just as our cells can be divided and separated from us, so can our very brains be

59
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,160
divided and separated from us, while still in the skull. Click here to go to my channel and watch

the next part. Okay, so now go watch CGP Grey's video. If you're not yet subscribed to his channel,

61
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,120
you should really change that now.
