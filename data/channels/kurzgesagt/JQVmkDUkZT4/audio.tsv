0	8800	Are you your body? Well, kind of, right? But is there a line where this stops being true?
8800	13380	How much of yourself can you remove before you stop being you?
13380	26320	And does the question even make sense?
26320	31640	Your physical existence is cells, trillions of them, at least ten times more than there
31640	38800	are stars in the Milky Way. A cell is a living being, a machine made of up to 50,000 different
38800	46040	proteins. It has no consciousness, no will, no purpose, it just is. But it is still an
46040	52600	individual. Together, your cells form huge structures for jobs like preparing food, gathering
52600	59020	resources, transporting stuff around, scanning the environment, and so on. If you extract
59020	63580	cells from your body and put them in the right environment, they will continue to stay alive
63580	71260	for a while. So, your cells can exist without you. But you can't exist without them. If
71260	77520	we take all the cells away, there is no you anymore. Is there a line where a pile of your
77520	83500	cells stops being you? For example, if you donate an organ, billions of your cells will
83500	88720	continue to live on inside someone else. Does this mean that a part of you became a part
88720	95940	of another person? Or, is this other body keeping a part of you alive? Or let us imagine
95940	102120	an experiment. You and a random person from the street exchange cells. One at a time,
102120	106940	your body gets one of their cells, their body gets one of your cells, at which point would
106940	113200	they become you? Would they ever? Or is this just a very slow and gross way to teleport
113200	120320	you? Let's make this more complicated. The image of ourselves as a static thing is untenable.
120320	126420	Almost all of your cells have to die during your lifetime. 250 million have died since
126420	133280	the beginning of this video alone. Between one and three million per second. In a seven
133280	139840	year period, most of your cells are replaced at least once. Every time your cell set up
139840	146420	changes, you are slightly different than before. So a part of you is dying constantly. If you
146420	152760	are lucky enough to become old, you will have cycled through roughly a million billion cells.
152760	159400	So what you consider yourself is really just a snapshot. But sometimes cells are broken
159400	164260	and don't want to die, questioning the very nature of the unity of our bodies. We call
164260	171680	them cancer. They cancel the biological social contract and become basically immortal. Cancer
171680	177140	is not an outside invader. It's a part of you that puts its own survival over yours.
177140	181440	But you could also argue that a cancer cell becomes another entity inside us. Another
181440	187200	being that just wants to thrive and survive. Can we blame it for that? A chilling cell
187200	193440	story is that of Henrietta Lacks, a young cancer patient who died in 1951. Usually,
193440	198920	cells only survived for a few days in the lab, making research very hard. Henrietta's
198920	203800	cancer cells were immortal. Over the decades, they were multiplied over and over again and
203800	209640	used for countless research projects, saving countless lives. Henrietta's cells are still
209640	215560	alive and overall have been grown to at least 20 tons of biomass. So there are living parts
215560	220980	around the world from someone who has been considered dead for decades. How much of Henrietta
220980	228560	is in these cells? What makes one of your cells you anyway? Maybe the information contained
228560	234320	in it, your DNA. Until recently, it was believed that all the cells in your body had basically
234320	241680	the same genetic code. But it turns out this is wrong. Your genome is mobile, changing
241680	246640	over time through mutations and environmental influences. This is especially the case in
246640	252000	your brain. According to recent discoveries, a single neuron in an adult brain has more
252000	257380	than 1000 mutations in its genetic code that are not present in the cells surrounding it.
257380	263920	But how much you is your DNA really? About 8% of the human genome is made up of viruses
263920	269560	that once infected our ancestors and merged with us. Mitochondria, power plants of the
269560	274880	cell, once were bacteria that merged with the ancestors of your cells. They still have
274880	280640	their own DNA. An average cell has hundreds of them, hundreds of little things that are
280640	288400	not really human, but they still kind of are. It is confusing. Let's backtrack a bit. We
288400	293240	know that you're made up of trillions of little things made from more little things that are
293240	298640	constantly changing. Together, all those little things are not static, but dynamic. Their
298640	305120	composition and condition is changing constantly. So we might just be a self-sustaining pattern
305120	310680	without clear borders that gained self-awareness at some point, and now has the ability to think
310680	317840	about itself through time and space, but really only exists in this exact very moment. Where did
317840	324160	this pattern start? With your conception? When the first human arose? When life first began
324160	329280	conquering our small planet? Or when the elements that make up your body were forged in a star?
329280	336400	Our human brains evolved to deal with absolutes. The fuzzy borders that make up reality are hard
336400	344960	to grasp. Maybe ideas like beginning and end, life and death, you and me, are really not absolutes,
344960	351760	but ideas belonging to a fluent pattern, a pattern that is lost in this strange and beautiful
352080	359880	universe. The problem of who we are isn't just a question of our cells, but it's also a question
359880	366360	of our minds. Just as our cells can be divided and separated from us, so can our very brains be
366360	372160	divided and separated from us, while still in the skull. Click here to go to my channel and watch
372160	379440	the next part. Okay, so now go watch CGP Grey's video. If you're not yet subscribed to his channel,
379440	381120	you should really change that now.
