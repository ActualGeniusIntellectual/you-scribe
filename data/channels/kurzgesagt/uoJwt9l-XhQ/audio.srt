1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:07,360
An undead city under siege. Soldiers and police ruthlessly shooting down waves of zombies that

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:14,320
flood from infected streets, trying to escape and infect more cities. This is what happens when your

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:27,840
body fights cancer, more exciting than any movie. How does this battle for survival unfold?

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,960
1. The elimination phase. It all begins with a single corrupted cell. It's no longer able

5
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,960
to repair its genetic code, it can't kill itself anymore, and it's beginning to multiply rapidly.

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,640
At this point, things are not great, not terrible. This cell is not yet dangerous,

7
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,760
but if nothing happens, it soon will be. Over a few weeks, the corrupted cell keeps

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,640
making copies of itself. One cell turns into dozens, hundreds, thousands. Because the original

9
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,120
was broken, its copies are breaking and mutating even more. They turn into different genetic

10
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:13,200
lineages, clans that are working together and competing. Some mutate in a way that makes them

11
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,960
weaker, others mutations don't change anything, while a few become fitter and better at survival.

12
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,520
Together, they now form a tiny, tiny tumor. Not cancer yet, but getting there.

13
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,440
The growing tumor needs a lot of resources. If the cells don't get food and oxygen,

14
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:37,440
they'll die and the problem just solves itself. Unfortunately, a few corrupted cells unlock a new

15
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:43,760
mutation that saves them. The ability to order the growth of new blood vessels. And so your body

16
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:49,360
provides the supply they need to survive. But as the tumor continues to grow, it starts causing

17
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,920
damage. Neighboring healthy cells begin to starve and die, which attracts attention. In a sense,

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,840
this tiny tumor is like a rogue town. Imagine a group of rebels in Brooklyn decide that they're

19
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,800
no longer part of New York and start a new settlement called Tumor Town, which happens

20
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,880
to occupy the same space. The new city wants to grow, so it orders tons of steel beams, cement,

21
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:19,360
and drywall. New buildings follow no logic, are badly planned, ugly, and dangerously crooked.

22
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,480
They're built right in the middle of streets, on top of playgrounds, and on existing infrastructure.

23
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,200
The old neighborhood is torn down or overbuilt to make room for new stuff. Many of the former

24
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,160
residents are trapped in the middle of it and begin to starve. This goes on for a while until

25
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,680
the smell of death finally attracts attention. Building inspectors and police show up. In your

26
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,360
body, attracted by the stench of dead cells, your immune system is activated. First responder

27
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,280
immune cells invade the tumor. Macrophages and natural killer cells, police forces that go right

28
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,880
to work, killing and eating tumor cells. They release chemical signals that let the whole

29
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,160
immune system know that there is cancer to be eradicated. Dendritic cells, the intelligence

30
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,360
officers of your immune system, collect samples of dead tumor cells and begin activating your heavy

31
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:14,000
weapons, helper and killer T cells. We explained these specialized super weapons in another video,

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,720
but all you really need to know is that they have a library listing every bad thing that could come

33
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,280
into your body. While each cancer is unique, there are genetic corruptions that they can't hide,

34
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,720
and your T cells know what to look for. They are the deadliest cancer killers you have.

35
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,360
By the time they arrive, the tumor has grown to hundreds of thousands of cells,

36
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,440
but this is about to change. T cells block the growth of new blood vessels, which starves

37
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,800
thousands of tumor cells and puts an end to their growth. Imagine the building inspectors

38
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,320
switching off electricity and water and putting up roadblocks to cancer town so no more food or

39
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:58,000
materials can be delivered. With no way to hide from the carnage unfolding, the tumor collapses

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,120
as hundreds of thousands of tumor cells are massacred. Their carcasses are cleaned up and

41
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,680
consumed by macrophages that then order healthy tissue to regenerate. Your body has crushed the

42
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,040
illegal tumor town without mercy. You'll never know about this fight or how many times this

43
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,080
has happened inside your body, except in this case, something didn't go as planned.

44
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:28,560
Two, the equilibrium phase. Unfortunately, natural selection spores your victory.

45
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,280
By doing its best to destroy the tumor, your immune system accidentally selects the fittest

46
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,400
tumor cells. Remember, the tumor consists of different lineages that keep growing and keep

47
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:45,520
mutating. Most of these are eradicated, but just a few are more resilient. Once cell survives,

48
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,840
it comes from the fittest tumor lineage and was just a bit better at surviving the massacre than

49
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:57,120
anyone else. It decides to do it all over again, but better this time. This tumor cell is much

50
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,000
stronger than any of the thousands that were killed. Maybe it's better at hiding or fighting

51
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,520
back. Maybe it grows faster or is better at stealing resources. Maybe it can survive with

52
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,880
much less oxygen, and so it all begins again. It's like the surviving rebels that started

53
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,920
tumor town have learned their lessons. Now they know the law better and how to break it,

54
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:23,360
what permits help them, and how to avoid the police. And so the surviving tumor cell makes

55
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,120
thousands of copies that mutate and form new lineages until once again, a tumor has grown

56
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,640
made up of more resilient cells. The immune system doesn't care though, and this time it even has

57
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,560
experience. Instead of starting with police, SWAT teams go right in to tear tumor town down,

58
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,400
killing its inhabitants without mercy. But once again, they don't get everyone. One of them

59
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,320
survives, a fitter tumor cell from an already fitter lineage. This time it gets a cheap suit

60
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,400
and studies the building code, pretending to be a lawyer to start tumor town all over again.

61
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,080
This struggle now repeats a few times. Each time the rebels learn a bit more about how to avoid

62
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,600
the law. If at any point the immune system gets ordered the tumor cells, the story ends,

63
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:14,160
but in this case it doesn't. Finally, a tumor cell changes in a way that makes it properly

64
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:21,520
dangerous cancer. The type that kills people. How? Immune cells have an off switch that

65
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,640
deactivates them before they can attack, which in principle is a good idea. The immune system

66
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,760
is extremely dangerous and in many cases it needs to be shut down, like around your central nervous

67
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,600
system. But this off switch can be exploited. The mutated tumor cell finds a way to switch

68
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,360
the immune system off by targeting inhibitor receptors on anti-cancer cells. Inhibitor

69
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,920
receptors stop immune cells from, well, killing. This cell is now the powerful founder of a new

70
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,800
lineage of cancer cells and mass produces thousands of new copies that once again

71
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:02,080
change and mutate further, building yet another tumor town. Three, the escape phase.

72
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,760
The new cancer cells have become immune to the immune system and everything is different this

73
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:14,080
time. Tumor town has been rebuilt even uglier and stranger than before, but now the cancer city

74
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,680
council has forged all sorts of permits. As building inspectors come to shut down construction,

75
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,440
they get confused. Stunned, they wander off, unable to order the destruction of the sprawling

76
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,600
buildings. Police try to enter the illegal city to arrest the builders and execute inhabitants,

77
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,320
but this time Tumor town has erected its own roadblocks that keep the law from entering.

78
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:43,040
Confused officers stand around helplessly. As Tumor town slowly envelops the former Brooklyn

79
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,840
and more and more civilians die, T cell SWAT teams arrive to end this travesty,

80
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,440
but things get worse. New lineages of Tumor town officials have started to forge court documents

81
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,560
that order police to shoot with the SWAT teams. What the cancer cells are doing at this point

82
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,720
is actively shutting down immune defenses by sending corrupt signals. The now malignant tumor

83
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,560
is no longer a pushover and has begun creating the cancer microenvironment, a sort of borderland

84
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,160
that's hard to cross. All avenues of attack have been shut down and uncontrollable growth

85
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,560
is the consequence. This is a dangerous tumor. Cells that are strong and able to fight push your

86
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,720
immune system back and expand further. If more mutations happen, then some of the cancer cells

87
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,200
will begin to explore the world and expand into other tissues to build new towns. And this is

88
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,040
exactly what makes cancer so harmful. It's taking up space and stealing so many nutrients that your

89
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:47,440
true self has no room to function anymore. If this goes on for too long, organs will shut down.

90
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,800
But this tactic is a dead end. The more successful cancer gets, the more damage it does to its world.

91
00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:01,280
When the body dies, the cancer dies too. It truly is a game without winners. Except humanity is

92
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,800
planning to win this game. At this very moment, hundreds of thousands of scientists are working

93
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,480
on new and better ways of getting cancer to destroy and burn down tumor towns for good.

94
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,400
In recent years, immunotherapy has made enormous progress. It's a relatively new therapy in which

95
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:24,160
your own immune cells are modified to kill cancer better than any medicine can do. It's like giving

96
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,760
your building inspectors machine guns and flamethrowers. But this is a story for another time.

97
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,960
For now, cancer is a battleground. But if human ingenuity is to be trusted, then one day,

98
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,160
maybe in the not-too-distant future, we will eradicate it once and for all.
