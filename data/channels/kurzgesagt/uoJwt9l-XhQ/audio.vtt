00:00.640 --> 00:07.360
An undead city under siege. Soldiers and police ruthlessly shooting down waves of zombies that

00:07.360 --> 00:14.320
flood from infected streets, trying to escape and infect more cities. This is what happens when your

00:14.320 --> 00:27.840
body fights cancer, more exciting than any movie. How does this battle for survival unfold?

00:30.000 --> 00:36.960
1. The elimination phase. It all begins with a single corrupted cell. It's no longer able

00:36.960 --> 00:42.960
to repair its genetic code, it can't kill itself anymore, and it's beginning to multiply rapidly.

00:42.960 --> 00:48.640
At this point, things are not great, not terrible. This cell is not yet dangerous,

00:48.640 --> 00:53.760
but if nothing happens, it soon will be. Over a few weeks, the corrupted cell keeps

00:53.760 --> 01:00.640
making copies of itself. One cell turns into dozens, hundreds, thousands. Because the original

01:00.640 --> 01:07.120
was broken, its copies are breaking and mutating even more. They turn into different genetic

01:07.120 --> 01:13.200
lineages, clans that are working together and competing. Some mutate in a way that makes them

01:13.200 --> 01:18.960
weaker, others mutations don't change anything, while a few become fitter and better at survival.

01:19.760 --> 01:25.520
Together, they now form a tiny, tiny tumor. Not cancer yet, but getting there.

01:26.640 --> 01:31.440
The growing tumor needs a lot of resources. If the cells don't get food and oxygen,

01:31.440 --> 01:37.440
they'll die and the problem just solves itself. Unfortunately, a few corrupted cells unlock a new

01:37.440 --> 01:43.760
mutation that saves them. The ability to order the growth of new blood vessels. And so your body

01:43.760 --> 01:49.360
provides the supply they need to survive. But as the tumor continues to grow, it starts causing

01:49.360 --> 01:55.920
damage. Neighboring healthy cells begin to starve and die, which attracts attention. In a sense,

01:55.920 --> 02:01.840
this tiny tumor is like a rogue town. Imagine a group of rebels in Brooklyn decide that they're

02:01.840 --> 02:06.800
no longer part of New York and start a new settlement called Tumor Town, which happens

02:06.800 --> 02:12.880
to occupy the same space. The new city wants to grow, so it orders tons of steel beams, cement,

02:12.880 --> 02:19.360
and drywall. New buildings follow no logic, are badly planned, ugly, and dangerously crooked.

02:19.360 --> 02:24.480
They're built right in the middle of streets, on top of playgrounds, and on existing infrastructure.

02:24.480 --> 02:29.200
The old neighborhood is torn down or overbuilt to make room for new stuff. Many of the former

02:29.200 --> 02:34.160
residents are trapped in the middle of it and begin to starve. This goes on for a while until

02:34.160 --> 02:39.680
the smell of death finally attracts attention. Building inspectors and police show up. In your

02:39.680 --> 02:45.360
body, attracted by the stench of dead cells, your immune system is activated. First responder

02:45.360 --> 02:51.280
immune cells invade the tumor. Macrophages and natural killer cells, police forces that go right

02:51.280 --> 02:56.880
to work, killing and eating tumor cells. They release chemical signals that let the whole

02:56.880 --> 03:02.160
immune system know that there is cancer to be eradicated. Dendritic cells, the intelligence

03:02.160 --> 03:07.360
officers of your immune system, collect samples of dead tumor cells and begin activating your heavy

03:07.360 --> 03:14.000
weapons, helper and killer T cells. We explained these specialized super weapons in another video,

03:14.000 --> 03:18.720
but all you really need to know is that they have a library listing every bad thing that could come

03:18.720 --> 03:25.280
into your body. While each cancer is unique, there are genetic corruptions that they can't hide,

03:25.280 --> 03:30.720
and your T cells know what to look for. They are the deadliest cancer killers you have.

03:31.280 --> 03:35.360
By the time they arrive, the tumor has grown to hundreds of thousands of cells,

03:35.360 --> 03:41.440
but this is about to change. T cells block the growth of new blood vessels, which starves

03:41.440 --> 03:46.800
thousands of tumor cells and puts an end to their growth. Imagine the building inspectors

03:46.800 --> 03:52.320
switching off electricity and water and putting up roadblocks to cancer town so no more food or

03:52.320 --> 03:58.000
materials can be delivered. With no way to hide from the carnage unfolding, the tumor collapses

03:58.000 --> 04:03.120
as hundreds of thousands of tumor cells are massacred. Their carcasses are cleaned up and

04:03.120 --> 04:09.680
consumed by macrophages that then order healthy tissue to regenerate. Your body has crushed the

04:09.680 --> 04:15.040
illegal tumor town without mercy. You'll never know about this fight or how many times this

04:15.040 --> 04:20.080
has happened inside your body, except in this case, something didn't go as planned.

04:21.920 --> 04:28.560
Two, the equilibrium phase. Unfortunately, natural selection spores your victory.

04:28.560 --> 04:33.280
By doing its best to destroy the tumor, your immune system accidentally selects the fittest

04:33.280 --> 04:38.400
tumor cells. Remember, the tumor consists of different lineages that keep growing and keep

04:38.400 --> 04:45.520
mutating. Most of these are eradicated, but just a few are more resilient. Once cell survives,

04:45.520 --> 04:49.840
it comes from the fittest tumor lineage and was just a bit better at surviving the massacre than

04:49.840 --> 04:57.120
anyone else. It decides to do it all over again, but better this time. This tumor cell is much

04:57.120 --> 05:02.000
stronger than any of the thousands that were killed. Maybe it's better at hiding or fighting

05:02.000 --> 05:07.520
back. Maybe it grows faster or is better at stealing resources. Maybe it can survive with

05:07.520 --> 05:12.880
much less oxygen, and so it all begins again. It's like the surviving rebels that started

05:12.880 --> 05:17.920
tumor town have learned their lessons. Now they know the law better and how to break it,

05:17.920 --> 05:23.360
what permits help them, and how to avoid the police. And so the surviving tumor cell makes

05:23.360 --> 05:29.120
thousands of copies that mutate and form new lineages until once again, a tumor has grown

05:29.120 --> 05:34.640
made up of more resilient cells. The immune system doesn't care though, and this time it even has

05:34.640 --> 05:40.560
experience. Instead of starting with police, SWAT teams go right in to tear tumor town down,

05:40.560 --> 05:46.400
killing its inhabitants without mercy. But once again, they don't get everyone. One of them

05:46.400 --> 05:52.320
survives, a fitter tumor cell from an already fitter lineage. This time it gets a cheap suit

05:52.320 --> 05:56.400
and studies the building code, pretending to be a lawyer to start tumor town all over again.

05:57.040 --> 06:02.080
This struggle now repeats a few times. Each time the rebels learn a bit more about how to avoid

06:02.080 --> 06:07.600
the law. If at any point the immune system gets ordered the tumor cells, the story ends,

06:07.600 --> 06:14.160
but in this case it doesn't. Finally, a tumor cell changes in a way that makes it properly

06:14.160 --> 06:21.520
dangerous cancer. The type that kills people. How? Immune cells have an off switch that

06:21.520 --> 06:26.640
deactivates them before they can attack, which in principle is a good idea. The immune system

06:26.640 --> 06:31.760
is extremely dangerous and in many cases it needs to be shut down, like around your central nervous

06:31.760 --> 06:37.600
system. But this off switch can be exploited. The mutated tumor cell finds a way to switch

06:37.600 --> 06:43.360
the immune system off by targeting inhibitor receptors on anti-cancer cells. Inhibitor

06:43.360 --> 06:49.920
receptors stop immune cells from, well, killing. This cell is now the powerful founder of a new

06:49.920 --> 06:54.800
lineage of cancer cells and mass produces thousands of new copies that once again

06:54.800 --> 07:02.080
change and mutate further, building yet another tumor town. Three, the escape phase.

07:02.880 --> 07:07.760
The new cancer cells have become immune to the immune system and everything is different this

07:07.760 --> 07:14.080
time. Tumor town has been rebuilt even uglier and stranger than before, but now the cancer city

07:14.080 --> 07:19.680
council has forged all sorts of permits. As building inspectors come to shut down construction,

07:19.680 --> 07:25.440
they get confused. Stunned, they wander off, unable to order the destruction of the sprawling

07:25.440 --> 07:31.600
buildings. Police try to enter the illegal city to arrest the builders and execute inhabitants,

07:31.600 --> 07:36.320
but this time Tumor town has erected its own roadblocks that keep the law from entering.

07:36.880 --> 07:43.040
Confused officers stand around helplessly. As Tumor town slowly envelops the former Brooklyn

07:43.040 --> 07:47.840
and more and more civilians die, T cell SWAT teams arrive to end this travesty,

07:47.840 --> 07:53.440
but things get worse. New lineages of Tumor town officials have started to forge court documents

07:53.440 --> 07:58.560
that order police to shoot with the SWAT teams. What the cancer cells are doing at this point

07:58.560 --> 08:04.720
is actively shutting down immune defenses by sending corrupt signals. The now malignant tumor

08:04.720 --> 08:10.560
is no longer a pushover and has begun creating the cancer microenvironment, a sort of borderland

08:10.560 --> 08:16.160
that's hard to cross. All avenues of attack have been shut down and uncontrollable growth

08:16.160 --> 08:22.560
is the consequence. This is a dangerous tumor. Cells that are strong and able to fight push your

08:22.560 --> 08:28.720
immune system back and expand further. If more mutations happen, then some of the cancer cells

08:28.720 --> 08:35.200
will begin to explore the world and expand into other tissues to build new towns. And this is

08:35.200 --> 08:41.040
exactly what makes cancer so harmful. It's taking up space and stealing so many nutrients that your

08:41.040 --> 08:47.440
true self has no room to function anymore. If this goes on for too long, organs will shut down.

08:47.440 --> 08:52.800
But this tactic is a dead end. The more successful cancer gets, the more damage it does to its world.

08:53.360 --> 09:01.280
When the body dies, the cancer dies too. It truly is a game without winners. Except humanity is

09:01.280 --> 09:06.800
planning to win this game. At this very moment, hundreds of thousands of scientists are working

09:06.800 --> 09:12.480
on new and better ways of getting cancer to destroy and burn down tumor towns for good.

09:12.480 --> 09:18.400
In recent years, immunotherapy has made enormous progress. It's a relatively new therapy in which

09:18.400 --> 09:24.160
your own immune cells are modified to kill cancer better than any medicine can do. It's like giving

09:24.160 --> 09:29.760
your building inspectors machine guns and flamethrowers. But this is a story for another time.

09:30.720 --> 09:36.960
For now, cancer is a battleground. But if human ingenuity is to be trusted, then one day,

09:36.960 --> 09:42.160
maybe in the not-too-distant future, we will eradicate it once and for all.
