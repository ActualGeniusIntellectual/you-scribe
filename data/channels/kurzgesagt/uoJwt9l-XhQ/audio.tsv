640	7360	An undead city under siege. Soldiers and police ruthlessly shooting down waves of zombies that
7360	14320	flood from infected streets, trying to escape and infect more cities. This is what happens when your
14320	27840	body fights cancer, more exciting than any movie. How does this battle for survival unfold?
30000	36960	1. The elimination phase. It all begins with a single corrupted cell. It's no longer able
36960	42960	to repair its genetic code, it can't kill itself anymore, and it's beginning to multiply rapidly.
42960	48640	At this point, things are not great, not terrible. This cell is not yet dangerous,
48640	53760	but if nothing happens, it soon will be. Over a few weeks, the corrupted cell keeps
53760	60640	making copies of itself. One cell turns into dozens, hundreds, thousands. Because the original
60640	67120	was broken, its copies are breaking and mutating even more. They turn into different genetic
67120	73200	lineages, clans that are working together and competing. Some mutate in a way that makes them
73200	78960	weaker, others mutations don't change anything, while a few become fitter and better at survival.
79760	85520	Together, they now form a tiny, tiny tumor. Not cancer yet, but getting there.
86640	91440	The growing tumor needs a lot of resources. If the cells don't get food and oxygen,
91440	97440	they'll die and the problem just solves itself. Unfortunately, a few corrupted cells unlock a new
97440	103760	mutation that saves them. The ability to order the growth of new blood vessels. And so your body
103760	109360	provides the supply they need to survive. But as the tumor continues to grow, it starts causing
109360	115920	damage. Neighboring healthy cells begin to starve and die, which attracts attention. In a sense,
115920	121840	this tiny tumor is like a rogue town. Imagine a group of rebels in Brooklyn decide that they're
121840	126800	no longer part of New York and start a new settlement called Tumor Town, which happens
126800	132880	to occupy the same space. The new city wants to grow, so it orders tons of steel beams, cement,
132880	139360	and drywall. New buildings follow no logic, are badly planned, ugly, and dangerously crooked.
139360	144480	They're built right in the middle of streets, on top of playgrounds, and on existing infrastructure.
144480	149200	The old neighborhood is torn down or overbuilt to make room for new stuff. Many of the former
149200	154160	residents are trapped in the middle of it and begin to starve. This goes on for a while until
154160	159680	the smell of death finally attracts attention. Building inspectors and police show up. In your
159680	165360	body, attracted by the stench of dead cells, your immune system is activated. First responder
165360	171280	immune cells invade the tumor. Macrophages and natural killer cells, police forces that go right
171280	176880	to work, killing and eating tumor cells. They release chemical signals that let the whole
176880	182160	immune system know that there is cancer to be eradicated. Dendritic cells, the intelligence
182160	187360	officers of your immune system, collect samples of dead tumor cells and begin activating your heavy
187360	194000	weapons, helper and killer T cells. We explained these specialized super weapons in another video,
194000	198720	but all you really need to know is that they have a library listing every bad thing that could come
198720	205280	into your body. While each cancer is unique, there are genetic corruptions that they can't hide,
205280	210720	and your T cells know what to look for. They are the deadliest cancer killers you have.
211280	215360	By the time they arrive, the tumor has grown to hundreds of thousands of cells,
215360	221440	but this is about to change. T cells block the growth of new blood vessels, which starves
221440	226800	thousands of tumor cells and puts an end to their growth. Imagine the building inspectors
226800	232320	switching off electricity and water and putting up roadblocks to cancer town so no more food or
232320	238000	materials can be delivered. With no way to hide from the carnage unfolding, the tumor collapses
238000	243120	as hundreds of thousands of tumor cells are massacred. Their carcasses are cleaned up and
243120	249680	consumed by macrophages that then order healthy tissue to regenerate. Your body has crushed the
249680	255040	illegal tumor town without mercy. You'll never know about this fight or how many times this
255040	260080	has happened inside your body, except in this case, something didn't go as planned.
261920	268560	Two, the equilibrium phase. Unfortunately, natural selection spores your victory.
268560	273280	By doing its best to destroy the tumor, your immune system accidentally selects the fittest
273280	278400	tumor cells. Remember, the tumor consists of different lineages that keep growing and keep
278400	285520	mutating. Most of these are eradicated, but just a few are more resilient. Once cell survives,
285520	289840	it comes from the fittest tumor lineage and was just a bit better at surviving the massacre than
289840	297120	anyone else. It decides to do it all over again, but better this time. This tumor cell is much
297120	302000	stronger than any of the thousands that were killed. Maybe it's better at hiding or fighting
302000	307520	back. Maybe it grows faster or is better at stealing resources. Maybe it can survive with
307520	312880	much less oxygen, and so it all begins again. It's like the surviving rebels that started
312880	317920	tumor town have learned their lessons. Now they know the law better and how to break it,
317920	323360	what permits help them, and how to avoid the police. And so the surviving tumor cell makes
323360	329120	thousands of copies that mutate and form new lineages until once again, a tumor has grown
329120	334640	made up of more resilient cells. The immune system doesn't care though, and this time it even has
334640	340560	experience. Instead of starting with police, SWAT teams go right in to tear tumor town down,
340560	346400	killing its inhabitants without mercy. But once again, they don't get everyone. One of them
346400	352320	survives, a fitter tumor cell from an already fitter lineage. This time it gets a cheap suit
352320	356400	and studies the building code, pretending to be a lawyer to start tumor town all over again.
357040	362080	This struggle now repeats a few times. Each time the rebels learn a bit more about how to avoid
362080	367600	the law. If at any point the immune system gets ordered the tumor cells, the story ends,
367600	374160	but in this case it doesn't. Finally, a tumor cell changes in a way that makes it properly
374160	381520	dangerous cancer. The type that kills people. How? Immune cells have an off switch that
381520	386640	deactivates them before they can attack, which in principle is a good idea. The immune system
386640	391760	is extremely dangerous and in many cases it needs to be shut down, like around your central nervous
391760	397600	system. But this off switch can be exploited. The mutated tumor cell finds a way to switch
397600	403360	the immune system off by targeting inhibitor receptors on anti-cancer cells. Inhibitor
403360	409920	receptors stop immune cells from, well, killing. This cell is now the powerful founder of a new
409920	414800	lineage of cancer cells and mass produces thousands of new copies that once again
414800	422080	change and mutate further, building yet another tumor town. Three, the escape phase.
422880	427760	The new cancer cells have become immune to the immune system and everything is different this
427760	434080	time. Tumor town has been rebuilt even uglier and stranger than before, but now the cancer city
434080	439680	council has forged all sorts of permits. As building inspectors come to shut down construction,
439680	445440	they get confused. Stunned, they wander off, unable to order the destruction of the sprawling
445440	451600	buildings. Police try to enter the illegal city to arrest the builders and execute inhabitants,
451600	456320	but this time Tumor town has erected its own roadblocks that keep the law from entering.
456880	463040	Confused officers stand around helplessly. As Tumor town slowly envelops the former Brooklyn
463040	467840	and more and more civilians die, T cell SWAT teams arrive to end this travesty,
467840	473440	but things get worse. New lineages of Tumor town officials have started to forge court documents
473440	478560	that order police to shoot with the SWAT teams. What the cancer cells are doing at this point
478560	484720	is actively shutting down immune defenses by sending corrupt signals. The now malignant tumor
484720	490560	is no longer a pushover and has begun creating the cancer microenvironment, a sort of borderland
490560	496160	that's hard to cross. All avenues of attack have been shut down and uncontrollable growth
496160	502560	is the consequence. This is a dangerous tumor. Cells that are strong and able to fight push your
502560	508720	immune system back and expand further. If more mutations happen, then some of the cancer cells
508720	515200	will begin to explore the world and expand into other tissues to build new towns. And this is
515200	521040	exactly what makes cancer so harmful. It's taking up space and stealing so many nutrients that your
521040	527440	true self has no room to function anymore. If this goes on for too long, organs will shut down.
527440	532800	But this tactic is a dead end. The more successful cancer gets, the more damage it does to its world.
533360	541280	When the body dies, the cancer dies too. It truly is a game without winners. Except humanity is
541280	546800	planning to win this game. At this very moment, hundreds of thousands of scientists are working
546800	552480	on new and better ways of getting cancer to destroy and burn down tumor towns for good.
552480	558400	In recent years, immunotherapy has made enormous progress. It's a relatively new therapy in which
558400	564160	your own immune cells are modified to kill cancer better than any medicine can do. It's like giving
564160	569760	your building inspectors machine guns and flamethrowers. But this is a story for another time.
570720	576960	For now, cancer is a battleground. But if human ingenuity is to be trusted, then one day,
576960	582160	maybe in the not-too-distant future, we will eradicate it once and for all.
