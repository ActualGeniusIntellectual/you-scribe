0	6940	Earth is 4.5 billion years old, impossible for your brain to truly grasp.
6940	9000	So here's an experiment.
9000	12760	Every second, around 1.5 million years will pass.
12760	18040	You're on a musical train ride, looking out the window, passing all of Earth's history
18040	19740	in an hour.
19740	25400	Watch the aeons pass and experience how long a billion years really is.
25400	30240	You can have this in the background, study with it, or just enjoy the ride.
30240	33240	From time to time, I'll say a few words.
33240	41440	4.5 billion years ago, right after it was born, Earth was a hell of lava.
41440	47920	Pretty early in its history, Earth collides with a Mars-sized object called Theia, which
47920	53840	forms the moon that you now see in the sky.
53840	59240	But now, it looks huge in the night sky, and will slowly shrink over hundreds of millions
59240	63680	of years as it orbits further away.
63680	73720	4.5 billion years ago, we are in the first aeon of our planet, the Hadean, named after
73720	76680	the Greek god of the underworld.
83840	99080	At this point, the atmosphere is mostly CO2, and the floor is lava.
99080	125960	This area of Earth's history is mostly invisible to us, because almost none of it is left.
125960	128640	Ninety million years have passed.
128640	132080	We are still in the lava hell phase.
158640	173040	Although you wouldn't think it, we found minerals called zircons that indicate there
173040	198440	may have been some water around at this time.
198440	226840	3.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
226840	255240	4.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
255240	284640	5.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
284640	314040	4.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
314040	343440	5.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
343440	372840	6.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
372840	402240	7.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
402240	418640	8.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
432640	438640	At this point in time, our sun is 30% less bright than it is today.
438640	444640	But there are so many greenhouse gases that it's still much hot and comfy.
462240	486640	7.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
486640	501040	Around this time, we think life begins to enter the stage.
501040	506040	Only a few hundred million years after the beginning of everything,
506040	517440	the first cells begin spreading over our still very deadly planet.
517440	524440	Earth continues to cool and it probably rains for millions of years as our oceans begin to form,
524440	532840	covering the still young planet with water.
554440	574840	7.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
574840	599240	8.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
599240	623640	7.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
623640	648040	8.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
648040	672440	9.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
672440	696840	10.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
696840	721240	11.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
721240	745640	12.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
745640	774040	13.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
774040	798440	14.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
798440	824840	15.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
824840	827240	You've witnessed a billion years so far.
854840	881240	16.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
881240	907640	17.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
907640	934040	18.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
934040	960440	19.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
960440	986840	20.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
986840	1013240	21.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
1013240	1039640	22.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
1039640	1066040	23.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
1066040	1075080	From this time in history, we still have stromatolites, sedimentary rocks built by
1075080	1083040	microorganisms, among our first real evidence of life on Earth. Also, life is starting to eat the
1083040	1098040	sun. Photosynthesis might have started as early as around here.
1114040	1123960	3.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins. Tectonic plates begin
1123960	1129440	to crush into each other, pulling and pushing some deep into the Earth, where they dissolve.
1129440	1139160	The basis for our continents today. The oceans are as hot as a hot tub, over 40 degrees Celsius,
1139200	1146600	and microbes are expanding everywhere. We don't have plants yet to consume greenhouse gases,
1146600	1154760	so it is really, really hot. You would basically die immediately in this atmosphere. Also,
1154760	1157440	there's no oxygen in the atmosphere yet.
1169160	1181160	4.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
1199160	1209160	5.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
1229160	1240160	5.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
1259160	1270160	4.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
1289160	1299160	5.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
1319160	1330160	5.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
1349160	1360160	5.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
1379160	1389160	5.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
1409160	1435160	2.8 billion years ago, the Neoarchaean begins.
1435160	1442160	Earth is still a terribly hostile place, but because we finally have proper plate tectonics,
1442160	1448160	more chemicals are mixed in from inside the Earth, and life can use them to make new things.
1465160	1480160	Sometime around here, prokaryotes like bacteria begin colonizing the planet.
1480160	1490160	Life diversifies more and more. But still, after so much time, we only have single cells.
1495160	1510160	5.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
1510160	1525160	5.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
1540160	1555160	6.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

1630160	1645160	9.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
1645160	1674160	2.5 billion years ago in the Ciderian, a massive event is about to begin that will change the planet forever.
1674160	1686160	The great oxidation event. Oxygen, burped out by cyanobacteria, reaches the atmosphere in large quantities, paving the way for more complex life.
1704160	1719160	5.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
1734160	1753160	6.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
1753160	1778160	7.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
1778160	1787160	All the new oxygen in the air reacts with methane and forms CO2 and water, which rapidly cools the planet down.
1808160	1824160	Probably for the first time ever, the planet freezes over and a period of multiple ice ages begins, lasting millions of years.
1824160	1831160	2.3 billion years ago, the Rhaetian begins.
1854160	1864160	3.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
1864160	1874160	4.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
1874160	1880160	Lots of volcanoes heat up Earth and Earth unfreezes slowly again.
1880160	1890160	Melting ice flushes toxic elements into the oceans, but life quietly puts up resistance and keeps evolving.
1904160	1918160	5.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
1934160	1954160	6.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
1964160	1980160	7.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
1994160	2010160	7.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
2024160	2040160	Sometime 2.05 billion years ago in the Orasirian, a large asteroid hits Earth and creates the largest verified impact structure on Earth.
2054160	2070160	7.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
2070160	2084160	8.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
2084160	2094160	7.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

2164160	2188160	7.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
2188160	2212160	8.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
2212160	2227160	1.8 billion years ago in the Stotherian, the supercontinent Columbia has formed.
2227160	2247160	8.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
2247160	2271160	7.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
2271160	2295160	8.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
2295160	2319160	9.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
2319160	2343160	10.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
2343160	2367160	11.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
2367160	2383360	1.6 billion years ago around the edge of Calimian, plus or minus a few hundred million
2383360	2390680	years or so, the first eukaryotic cells, cells with a nucleus, merge from two other cells.
2390680	2394680	One of the most important moments in the history of life.
2395200	2398680	But yes, kind of looks not that impressive.
2398680	2401680	Still, life is only cells.
2424680	2439680	9.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
2454680	2474680	10.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
2474680	2495680	11.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
2495680	2501680	Earth's crust thickens and heavy continents form, the oceans become shallower.
2501680	2508680	Also, the first fungi-like organisms extend their tubular arms and do fungi things.
2531680	2543680	Sometime in the Ektasian, 1.4 billion years ago, Earth's inner core is forming.
2543680	2547680	Weird rice feels like it should be older.
2547680	2554680	But around here, it begins to solidify into an iron crystal surrounded by hot liquid metal.
2554680	2557680	It will only grow from now on.
2584680	2594680	10.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
2614680	2624680	10.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
2644680	2654680	10.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.
2674680	2699680	1.2 billion years ago in the Stenaean, not that much is going on.
2699680	2709680	Except the algae banjo morphopubescence might have invented sex, a big reproductive improvement for many different reasons.
2759680	2775680	2.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.
2775680	2785680	3.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.
2805680	2815680	4.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.
2835680	2853680	5.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.
2853680	2861680	1 billion years ago, the Tonian begins, another age where Earth is rocks and puddles and oceans.
2861680	2869680	Life is still invisible to the naked eye. It does feel different to witness it like that, right?
2891680	2901680	4.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.
2921680	2931680	5.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.
2951680	2961680	6.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.
2981680	2991680	7.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.
2991680	3001680	8.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.
3001680	3011680	Not everybody is having a great time here.
3011680	3017680	We have evidence of the first unicellular predators emerging around that time.
3017680	3023680	The dominance of bacteria ends and big boy eukaryotes plant their flags in the oceans.
3023680	3029680	An arms race between microbes begins that again creates huge diversity.
3029680	3033680	Even invent tiny armor.
3059680	3079680	7.2 million years ago in the Cryogenian, Earth freezes over again.
3079680	3087680	Sure, why not? How did life survive? We are not sure.
3109680	3119680	6.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.
3139680	3149680	635 million years ago, the supercontinent Gondwana forms. A lot of it is still left today.
3169680	3179680	7.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.
3179680	3189680	7.2 billion years ago in the Cryogenian, Earth freezes over again.
3189680	3199680	7.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.
3199680	3205680	In a hot second, multicellular organisms become widespread. It's all strange aliens still.
3205680	3215680	But can you imagine that it took that long for this to happen?
3215680	3223680	539 million years ago, the Cambrian explosion begins. We see life bursting with variety.
3223680	3231680	Ancestors of almost all of today's major animal groups appear here, while the plants start to discover the land.
3231680	3241680	Life is finally exciting. But of course, a big mass extinction happens right after, killing most species in the ocean.
3253680	3263680	6.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.
3263680	3273680	7.2 billion years ago in the Cryogenian, Earth freezes over again.
3273680	3283680	7.2 billion years ago in the Cryogenian, not that much is going on.
3283680	3293680	7.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.
3293680	3309680	Plants spread over the planet and create the soil on the ground and change the atmosphere by eating CO2.
3323680	3345680	Things escalate. Flora and fauna adapt better and better to life on land.
3345680	3355680	Trees and forests. Fish and the first vertebrate decide this land thing is something they need to try out.
3355680	3365680	359 million years ago in the Carboniferous, forests and lush marshlands are at their peak.
3365680	3371680	They will turn into the coal humanity burns today to keep ourselves warm.
3371680	3379680	It's all so fast now. Life changes so quickly in geological timeframes.
3402680	3409680	Some 299 million years ago in the Permian, Pangaea, the last supercontinent, has formed.
3409680	3418680	And after a few tens of million years, the largest mass extinction in history happens, killing the majority of all species.
3418680	3420680	Thanks, volcanoes.
3431680	3447680	252 million years ago, the Triassic begins.
3447680	3463680	Oh, hey, a dinosaur.
3477680	3487680	We are now truly in the age of reptiles. Dinosaurs are everywhere.
3487680	3492680	The ancestors of the birds do bird things.
3492680	3496680	Life finds a way.
3552680	3577680	Earth gets more and more familiar.
3577680	3582680	Such a paradise. Life is thriving.
3582680	3589680	Nothing can go wrong. Wait, what's that?
3589680	3596680	And an asteroid killed the dinosaurs and most species on Earth. Such a bummer.
3596680	3605680	66 million years ago in the Paneogene, the continents look roughly the same as today, and mammals take over.
3605680	3612680	It is our time now. We are almost home.
3635680	3644680	Don't blink or you might miss all of human history.
3644680	3652680	And that was it. Earth is ancient. We are new. So new.
3652680	3660680	This was a project born of passion. We've worked on this video on and off since 2019, and as you can imagine, it took forever to make.
3660680	3669680	But we did finish it in time for our 10th anniversary. If you want to support experimental videos like this one, please like, share, and subscribe, and press the bell.
