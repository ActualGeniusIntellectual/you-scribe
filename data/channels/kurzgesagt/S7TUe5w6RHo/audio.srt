1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,940
Earth is 4.5 billion years old, impossible for your brain to truly grasp.

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,000
So here's an experiment.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,760
Every second, around 1.5 million years will pass.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:18,040
You're on a musical train ride, looking out the window, passing all of Earth's history

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,740
in an hour.

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,400
Watch the aeons pass and experience how long a billion years really is.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,240
You can have this in the background, study with it, or just enjoy the ride.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,240
From time to time, I'll say a few words.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:41,440
4.5 billion years ago, right after it was born, Earth was a hell of lava.

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,920
Pretty early in its history, Earth collides with a Mars-sized object called Theia, which

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,840
forms the moon that you now see in the sky.

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,240
But now, it looks huge in the night sky, and will slowly shrink over hundreds of millions

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,680
of years as it orbits further away.

14
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:13,720
4.5 billion years ago, we are in the first aeon of our planet, the Hadean, named after

15
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,680
the Greek god of the underworld.

16
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:39,080
At this point, the atmosphere is mostly CO2, and the floor is lava.

17
00:01:39,080 --> 00:02:05,960
This area of Earth's history is mostly invisible to us, because almost none of it is left.

18
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,640
Ninety million years have passed.

19
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,080
We are still in the lava hell phase.

20
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:53,040
Although you wouldn't think it, we found minerals called zircons that indicate there

21
00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:18,440
may have been some water around at this time.

22
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:46,840
3.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

23
00:03:46,840 --> 00:04:15,240
4.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

24
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:44,640
5.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

25
00:04:44,640 --> 00:05:14,040
4.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

26
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:43,440
5.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

27
00:05:43,440 --> 00:06:12,840
6.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

28
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:42,240
7.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

29
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:58,640
8.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

30
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:18,640
At this point in time, our sun is 30% less bright than it is today.

31
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:24,640
But there are so many greenhouse gases that it's still much hot and comfy.

32
00:07:42,240 --> 00:08:06,640
7.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

33
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:21,040
Around this time, we think life begins to enter the stage.

34
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:26,040
Only a few hundred million years after the beginning of everything,

35
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:37,440
the first cells begin spreading over our still very deadly planet.

36
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:44,440
Earth continues to cool and it probably rains for millions of years as our oceans begin to form,

37
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:52,840
covering the still young planet with water.

38
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:34,840
7.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

39
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:59,240
8.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

40
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:23,640
7.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

41
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:48,040
8.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

42
00:10:48,040 --> 00:11:12,440
9.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

43
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:36,840
10.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

44
00:11:36,840 --> 00:12:01,240
11.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

45
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:25,640
12.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

46
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:54,040
13.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

47
00:12:54,040 --> 00:13:18,440
14.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

48
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:44,840
15.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

49
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,240
You've witnessed a billion years so far.

50
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:41,240
16.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

51
00:14:41,240 --> 00:15:07,640
17.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

52
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:34,040
18.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

53
00:15:34,040 --> 00:16:00,440
19.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

54
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:26,840
20.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

55
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:53,240
21.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

56
00:16:53,240 --> 00:17:19,640
22.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

57
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:46,040
23.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

58
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:55,080
From this time in history, we still have stromatolites, sedimentary rocks built by

59
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:03,040
microorganisms, among our first real evidence of life on Earth. Also, life is starting to eat the

60
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:18,040
sun. Photosynthesis might have started as early as around here.

61
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:43,960
3.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins. Tectonic plates begin

62
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,440
to crush into each other, pulling and pushing some deep into the Earth, where they dissolve.

63
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:59,160
The basis for our continents today. The oceans are as hot as a hot tub, over 40 degrees Celsius,

64
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:06,600
and microbes are expanding everywhere. We don't have plants yet to consume greenhouse gases,

65
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:14,760
so it is really, really hot. You would basically die immediately in this atmosphere. Also,

66
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,440
there's no oxygen in the atmosphere yet.

67
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:41,160
4.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

68
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:09,160
5.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

69
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:40,160
5.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

70
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:10,160
4.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

71
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:39,160
5.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

72
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:10,160
5.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

73
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:40,160
5.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

74
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:09,160
5.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

75
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:55,160
2.8 billion years ago, the Neoarchaean begins.

76
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:02,160
Earth is still a terribly hostile place, but because we finally have proper plate tectonics,

77
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:08,160
more chemicals are mixed in from inside the Earth, and life can use them to make new things.

78
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:40,160
Sometime around here, prokaryotes like bacteria begin colonizing the planet.

79
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:50,160
Life diversifies more and more. But still, after so much time, we only have single cells.

80
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:10,160
5.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

81
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:25,160
5.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

82
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:55,160
6.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

83
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:25,160
7.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

84
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:55,160
8.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

85
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:25,160
9.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

86
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:54,160
2.5 billion years ago in the Ciderian, a massive event is about to begin that will change the planet forever.

87
00:27:54,160 --> 00:28:06,160
The great oxidation event. Oxygen, burped out by cyanobacteria, reaches the atmosphere in large quantities, paving the way for more complex life.

88
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:39,160
5.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

89
00:28:54,160 --> 00:29:13,160
6.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

90
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:38,160
7.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

91
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:47,160
All the new oxygen in the air reacts with methane and forms CO2 and water, which rapidly cools the planet down.

92
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:24,160
Probably for the first time ever, the planet freezes over and a period of multiple ice ages begins, lasting millions of years.

93
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:31,160
2.3 billion years ago, the Rhaetian begins.

94
00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:04,160
3.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

95
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:14,160
4.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

96
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:20,160
Lots of volcanoes heat up Earth and Earth unfreezes slowly again.

97
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:30,160
Melting ice flushes toxic elements into the oceans, but life quietly puts up resistance and keeps evolving.

98
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:58,160
5.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

99
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:34,160
6.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

100
00:32:44,160 --> 00:33:00,160
7.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

101
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:30,160
7.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

102
00:33:44,160 --> 00:34:00,160
Sometime 2.05 billion years ago in the Orasirian, a large asteroid hits Earth and creates the largest verified impact structure on Earth.

103
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:30,160
7.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

104
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:44,160
8.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

105
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:54,160
7.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

106
00:34:54,160 --> 00:35:08,160
8.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

107
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:44,160
7.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

108
00:35:44,160 --> 00:36:04,160
8.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

109
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:28,160
7.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

110
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:52,160
8.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

111
00:36:52,160 --> 00:37:07,160
1.8 billion years ago in the Stotherian, the supercontinent Columbia has formed.

112
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:27,160
8.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

113
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:51,160
7.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

114
00:37:51,160 --> 00:38:15,160
8.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

115
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:39,160
9.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

116
00:38:39,160 --> 00:39:03,160
10.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

117
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:27,160
11.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

118
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:43,360
1.6 billion years ago around the edge of Calimian, plus or minus a few hundred million

119
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:50,680
years or so, the first eukaryotic cells, cells with a nucleus, merge from two other cells.

120
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,680
One of the most important moments in the history of life.

121
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,680
But yes, kind of looks not that impressive.

122
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,680
Still, life is only cells.

123
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:39,680
9.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

124
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:14,680
10.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

125
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:35,680
11.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

126
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:41,680
Earth's crust thickens and heavy continents form, the oceans become shallower.

127
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:48,680
Also, the first fungi-like organisms extend their tubular arms and do fungi things.

128
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:23,680
Sometime in the Ektasian, 1.4 billion years ago, Earth's inner core is forming.

129
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,680
Weird rice feels like it should be older.

130
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:34,680
But around here, it begins to solidify into an iron crystal surrounded by hot liquid metal.

131
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,680
It will only grow from now on.

132
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:14,680
10.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

133
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:44,680
10.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

134
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:14,680
10.5 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins.

135
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:59,680
1.2 billion years ago in the Stenaean, not that much is going on.

136
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:09,680
Except the algae banjo morphopubescence might have invented sex, a big reproductive improvement for many different reasons.

137
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:15,680
2.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.

138
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:25,680
3.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.

139
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:55,680
4.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.

140
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:33,680
5.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.

141
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:41,680
1 billion years ago, the Tonian begins, another age where Earth is rocks and puddles and oceans.

142
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:49,680
Life is still invisible to the naked eye. It does feel different to witness it like that, right?

143
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:21,680
4.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.

144
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:51,680
5.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.

145
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:21,680
6.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.

146
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:51,680
7.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.

147
00:49:51,680 --> 00:50:01,680
8.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.

148
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:11,680
Not everybody is having a great time here.

149
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:17,680
We have evidence of the first unicellular predators emerging around that time.

150
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:23,680
The dominance of bacteria ends and big boy eukaryotes plant their flags in the oceans.

151
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:29,680
An arms race between microbes begins that again creates huge diversity.

152
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,680
Even invent tiny armor.

153
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:19,680
7.2 million years ago in the Cryogenian, Earth freezes over again.

154
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:27,680
Sure, why not? How did life survive? We are not sure.

155
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:59,680
6.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.

156
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:29,680
635 million years ago, the supercontinent Gondwana forms. A lot of it is still left today.

157
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:59,680
7.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.

158
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:09,680
7.2 billion years ago in the Cryogenian, Earth freezes over again.

159
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:19,680
7.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.

160
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:25,680
In a hot second, multicellular organisms become widespread. It's all strange aliens still.

161
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:35,680
But can you imagine that it took that long for this to happen?

162
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:43,680
539 million years ago, the Cambrian explosion begins. We see life bursting with variety.

163
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:51,680
Ancestors of almost all of today's major animal groups appear here, while the plants start to discover the land.

164
00:53:51,680 --> 00:54:01,680
Life is finally exciting. But of course, a big mass extinction happens right after, killing most species in the ocean.

165
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:23,680
6.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.

166
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:33,680
7.2 billion years ago in the Cryogenian, Earth freezes over again.

167
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:43,680
7.2 billion years ago in the Cryogenian, not that much is going on.

168
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:53,680
7.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, not that much is going on.

169
00:54:53,680 --> 00:55:09,680
Plants spread over the planet and create the soil on the ground and change the atmosphere by eating CO2.

170
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:45,680
Things escalate. Flora and fauna adapt better and better to life on land.

171
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:55,680
Trees and forests. Fish and the first vertebrate decide this land thing is something they need to try out.

172
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:05,680
359 million years ago in the Carboniferous, forests and lush marshlands are at their peak.

173
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:11,680
They will turn into the coal humanity burns today to keep ourselves warm.

174
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:19,680
It's all so fast now. Life changes so quickly in geological timeframes.

175
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:49,680
Some 299 million years ago in the Permian, Pangaea, the last supercontinent, has formed.

176
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:58,680
And after a few tens of million years, the largest mass extinction in history happens, killing the majority of all species.

177
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,680
Thanks, volcanoes.

178
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:27,680
252 million years ago, the Triassic begins.

179
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:43,680
Oh, hey, a dinosaur.

180
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:07,680
We are now truly in the age of reptiles. Dinosaurs are everywhere.

181
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:12,680
The ancestors of the birds do bird things.

182
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:16,680
Life finds a way.

183
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:37,680
Earth gets more and more familiar.

184
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:42,680
Such a paradise. Life is thriving.

185
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:49,680
Nothing can go wrong. Wait, what's that?

186
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:56,680
And an asteroid killed the dinosaurs and most species on Earth. Such a bummer.

187
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:05,680
66 million years ago in the Paneogene, the continents look roughly the same as today, and mammals take over.

188
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:12,680
It is our time now. We are almost home.

189
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:44,680
Don't blink or you might miss all of human history.

190
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:52,680
And that was it. Earth is ancient. We are new. So new.

191
01:00:52,680 --> 01:01:00,680
This was a project born of passion. We've worked on this video on and off since 2019, and as you can imagine, it took forever to make.

192
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:09,680
But we did finish it in time for our 10th anniversary. If you want to support experimental videos like this one, please like, share, and subscribe, and press the bell.

Discover how long it took for the first cellular blobs to evolve into fish, then into dinosaurs, and finally into mammals, and encounter amazing creatures you've never heard of along the way.

195
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:32,680
This poster is part of our Education Edition, a poster series that brings complex topics to life through extensive research and elaborate illustrations.
