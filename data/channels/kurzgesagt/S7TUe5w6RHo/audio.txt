Earth is 4.5 billion years old, impossible for your brain to truly grasp.
So here's an experiment.
Every second, around 1.5 million years will pass.
You're on a musical train ride, looking out the window, passing all of Earth's history
in an hour.
Watch the aeons pass and experience how long a billion years really is.
You can have this in the background, study with it, or just enjoy the ride.
From time to time, I'll say a few words.
4.5 billion years ago, right after it was born, Earth was a hell of lava.
Pretty early in its history, Earth collides with a Mars-sized object called Theia, which
forms the moon that you now see in the sky.
But now, it looks huge in the night sky, and will slowly shrink over hundreds of millions
of years as it orbits further away.
4.5 billion years ago, we are in the first aeon of our planet, the Hadean, named after
the Greek god of the underworld.
At this point, the atmosphere is mostly CO2, and the floor is lava.
This area of Earth's history is mostly invisible to us, because almost none of it is left.
Ninety million years have passed.
We are still in the lava hell phase.
Although you wouldn't think it, we found minerals called zircons that indicate there
may have been some water around at this time.
3.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.

At this point in time, our sun is 30% less bright than it is today.
But there are so many greenhouse gases that it's still much hot and comfy.
7.5 billion years ago, Earth was a hell of a lot longer than it was in the night sky.
Around this time, we think life begins to enter the stage.
Only a few hundred million years after the beginning of everything,
the first cells begin spreading over our still very deadly planet.
Earth continues to cool and it probably rains for millions of years as our oceans begin to form,
covering the still young planet with water.

From this time in history, we still have stromatolites, sedimentary rocks built by
microorganisms, among our first real evidence of life on Earth. Also, life is starting to eat the
sun. Photosynthesis might have started as early as around here.
3.2 billion years ago in the Mesoarchaean, the era of continents begins. Tectonic plates begin
to crush into each other, pulling and pushing some deep into the Earth, where they dissolve.
The basis for our continents today. The oceans are as hot as a hot tub, over 40 degrees Celsius,
and microbes are expanding everywhere. We don't have plants yet to consume greenhouse gases,
so it is really, really hot. You would basically die immediately in this atmosphere. Also,
there's no oxygen in the atmosphere yet.

Earth is still a terribly hostile place, but because we finally have proper plate tectonics,
more chemicals are mixed in from inside the Earth, and life can use them to make new things.
Sometime around here, prokaryotes like bacteria begin colonizing the planet.
Life diversifies more and more. But still, after so much time, we only have single cells.

years or so, the first eukaryotic cells, cells with a nucleus, merge from two other cells.
One of the most important moments in the history of life.
But yes, kind of looks not that impressive.
Still, life is only cells.

Also, the first fungi-like organisms extend their tubular arms and do fungi things.
Sometime in the Ektasian, 1.4 billion years ago, Earth's inner core is forming.
Weird rice feels like it should be older.
But around here, it begins to solidify into an iron crystal surrounded by hot liquid metal.
It will only grow from now on.

The dominance of bacteria ends and big boy eukaryotes plant their flags in the oceans.
An arms race between microbes begins that again creates huge diversity.
Even invent tiny armor.

In a hot second, multicellular organisms become widespread. It's all strange aliens still.
But can you imagine that it took that long for this to happen?
539 million years ago, the Cambrian explosion begins. We see life bursting with variety.
Ancestors of almost all of today's major animal groups appear here, while the plants start to discover the land.
Life is finally exciting. But of course, a big mass extinction happens right after, killing most species in the ocean.

Oh, hey, a dinosaur.
We are now truly in the age of reptiles. Dinosaurs are everywhere.
The ancestors of the birds do bird things.
Life finds a way.
Earth gets more and more familiar.
Such a paradise. Life is thriving.
Nothing can go wrong. Wait, what's that?
And an asteroid killed the dinosaurs and most species on Earth. Such a bummer.
66 million years ago in the Paneogene, the continents look roughly the same as today, and mammals take over.
It is our time now. We are almost home.
Don't blink or you might miss all of human history.
And that was it. Earth is ancient. We are new. So new.
This was a project born of passion. We've worked on this video on and off since 2019, and as you can imagine, it took forever to make.
But we did finish it in time for our 10th anniversary. If you want to support experimental videos like this one, please like, share, and subscribe, and press the bell.
