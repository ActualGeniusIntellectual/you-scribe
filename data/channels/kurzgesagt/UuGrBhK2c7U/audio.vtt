00:00.000 --> 00:13.540
The Ocean Conveyor Belt and the Gulf Stream

00:13.540 --> 00:16.980
Ocean currents have a direct influence on our lives.

00:16.980 --> 00:21.620
They determine our weather, our climate and much more.

00:21.620 --> 00:27.440
The ocean currents and wind systems transport heat from the equator to the poles and operate

00:27.440 --> 00:30.660
like a large engine for the global climate.

00:30.660 --> 00:33.760
In the oceans, there are numerous currents.

00:33.760 --> 00:38.620
The so-called ocean conveyor belt is very important for our climate.

00:38.620 --> 00:43.100
This term describes a combination of currents that result in four of the five global oceans

00:43.100 --> 00:45.520
exchanging water with each other.

00:45.520 --> 00:49.520
They form a worldwide circulation system.

00:49.520 --> 00:54.440
The conveyor belt is also called the thermohaline circulation, with thermo referring to the

00:54.440 --> 00:59.320
temperature and haline to the salt content of the water.

00:59.320 --> 01:02.560
Both determine the density of the water.

01:02.560 --> 01:07.200
While the masses of water may be moved in part by wind, primarily the different densities

01:07.200 --> 01:11.000
of the global oceans are responsible for their movement.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.640
Warm water has a lower density and rises, while cold water sinks.

01:16.640 --> 01:20.960
The water's density also increases with a higher salt content.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.720
At the equator, the heat from the sun is especially strong, resulting in a lot of evaporation

01:25.720 --> 01:29.800
and thus a rise in the water's salt content.

01:29.800 --> 01:32.600
That is where the Gulf Stream begins.

01:32.600 --> 01:37.400
The Gulf Stream is very important for the European climate.

01:37.400 --> 01:41.800
Its length of 10,000 kilometres makes it one of the largest and fastest ocean currents

01:41.800 --> 01:44.680
on Earth, and it is very warm.

01:44.680 --> 01:50.160
At roughly 2 metres a second, it brings up to 100 million cubic metres of water per second

01:50.160 --> 01:53.520
towards Europe.

01:53.520 --> 01:58.960
A constantly blowing wind, the southeast trade wind, drives warm surface water to the northwest

01:58.960 --> 02:04.760
into the Gulf of Mexico, where it heats up to 30 degrees Celsius.

02:04.760 --> 02:09.080
The turning of the Earth and the west winds then direct the Gulf Stream towards Europe

02:09.080 --> 02:11.040
and split it up.

02:11.040 --> 02:17.280
One part flows south, another east to the Canary Current, and a third part flows north,

02:17.280 --> 02:22.960
where it releases a lot of heat into the atmosphere as the North Atlantic Current.

02:22.960 --> 02:25.120
The water becomes colder there.

02:25.120 --> 02:30.080
Its salt content and density rise on account of evaporation, and it drops down between

02:30.080 --> 02:33.640
Greenland, Norway, and Iceland.

02:33.640 --> 02:39.880
There we also find the largest waterfall on Earth, the so-called chimneys, roughly 15

02:39.880 --> 02:44.600
kilometre wide pillars with water falling up to 4,000 metres.

02:44.600 --> 02:50.240
17 million cubic metres of water per second, or roughly 15 times more water than is carried

02:50.240 --> 02:53.480
by all the rivers in the world.

02:53.480 --> 02:58.280
This creates a strong maelstrom which constantly pulls in new water, and is the reason that

02:58.280 --> 03:00.760
the Gulf Stream moves towards Europe.

03:00.760 --> 03:04.560
Countless species use the Gulf Stream as a means of transport on their trips from the

03:04.560 --> 03:07.280
Caribbean to northern areas.

03:07.280 --> 03:08.800
But it doesn't just bring us animals.

03:08.800 --> 03:13.680
An enormous quantity of warm air also comes with it, in order to produce the same heat

03:13.760 --> 03:18.960
which it brings to the shores of Europe, we would need 1 million nuclear power plants.

03:18.960 --> 03:22.080
That's why we also call the Gulf Stream a heat pump.

03:22.080 --> 03:26.920
Without it, the temperature would be significantly colder here, at least 5 to 10 degrees.

03:26.920 --> 03:30.600
Instead of lush fields, we would have long winters and sparse ice-covered landscapes

03:30.600 --> 03:32.360
in Europe.

03:32.360 --> 03:36.860
In the last few years, scientists and pundits in the media have repeatedly expressed the

03:36.860 --> 03:42.160
fear that the Gulf Stream could come to a standstill due to climate change.

03:42.160 --> 03:46.040
Because if the polar caps actually melt, the salt content in the water off Greenland

03:46.040 --> 03:49.180
would fall, as would its density.

03:49.180 --> 03:53.440
The North Atlantic Current would no longer be heavy enough, and so it wouldn't sink

03:53.440 --> 03:55.840
as usual.

03:55.840 --> 04:01.880
In the worst case, that would bring the Gulf Stream, our heat pump, to a stop.

04:01.880 --> 04:07.860
Some climate experts also assume that climate change could compensate for this effect.

04:07.860 --> 04:11.880
We know that it can be normal for the climate to change by looking at the development of

04:11.880 --> 04:15.080
the Earth over the last few million years.

04:15.080 --> 04:18.520
There are ice ages and warm periods.

04:18.520 --> 04:23.640
In the last ice age, a gigantic flood of melting water crippled the heat-bringing North Atlantic

04:23.640 --> 04:28.800
Current, covering the northern hemisphere in ice.

04:28.800 --> 04:32.600
Scientists have different views on the impact that climate change will have on the global

04:32.600 --> 04:34.400
ocean conveyor belt.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.360
But one thing is clear.

04:36.360 --> 04:40.680
When the climate changes, then the complex system of ocean currents and winds, which

04:40.680 --> 04:45.240
has remained fairly stable since the last ice age, will change in ways that we don't

04:45.240 --> 04:46.320
yet understand.
