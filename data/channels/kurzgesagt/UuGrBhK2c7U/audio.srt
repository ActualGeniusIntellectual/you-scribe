00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,540
The Ocean Conveyor Belt and the Gulf Stream

2
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,980
Ocean currents have a direct influence on our lives.

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,620
They determine our weather, our climate and much more.

4
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:27,440
The ocean currents and wind systems transport heat from the equator to the poles and operate

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,660
like a large engine for the global climate.

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,760
In the oceans, there are numerous currents.

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,620
The so-called ocean conveyor belt is very important for our climate.

8
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,100
This term describes a combination of currents that result in four of the five global oceans

9
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,520
exchanging water with each other.

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,520
They form a worldwide circulation system.

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,440
The conveyor belt is also called the thermohaline circulation, with thermo referring to the

12
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,320
temperature and haline to the salt content of the water.

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,560
Both determine the density of the water.

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,200
While the masses of water may be moved in part by wind, primarily the different densities

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,000
of the global oceans are responsible for their movement.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,640
Warm water has a lower density and rises, while cold water sinks.

17
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,960
The water's density also increases with a higher salt content.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,720
At the equator, the heat from the sun is especially strong, resulting in a lot of evaporation

19
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,800
and thus a rise in the water's salt content.

20
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,600
That is where the Gulf Stream begins.

21
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,400
The Gulf Stream is very important for the European climate.

22
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,800
Its length of 10,000 kilometres makes it one of the largest and fastest ocean currents

23
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,680
on Earth, and it is very warm.

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,160
At roughly 2 metres a second, it brings up to 100 million cubic metres of water per second

25
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,520
towards Europe.

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,960
A constantly blowing wind, the southeast trade wind, drives warm surface water to the northwest

27
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,760
into the Gulf of Mexico, where it heats up to 30 degrees Celsius.

28
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,080
The turning of the Earth and the west winds then direct the Gulf Stream towards Europe

29
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,040
and split it up.

30
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:17,280
One part flows south, another east to the Canary Current, and a third part flows north,

31
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,960
where it releases a lot of heat into the atmosphere as the North Atlantic Current.

32
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,120
The water becomes colder there.

33
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,080
Its salt content and density rise on account of evaporation, and it drops down between

34
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,640
Greenland, Norway, and Iceland.

35
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,880
There we also find the largest waterfall on Earth, the so-called chimneys, roughly 15

36
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,600
kilometre wide pillars with water falling up to 4,000 metres.

37
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:50,240
17 million cubic metres of water per second, or roughly 15 times more water than is carried

38
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,480
by all the rivers in the world.

39
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,280
This creates a strong maelstrom which constantly pulls in new water, and is the reason that

40
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,760
the Gulf Stream moves towards Europe.

41
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,560
Countless species use the Gulf Stream as a means of transport on their trips from the

42
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,280
Caribbean to northern areas.

43
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,800
But it doesn't just bring us animals.

44
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,680
An enormous quantity of warm air also comes with it, in order to produce the same heat

45
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,960
which it brings to the shores of Europe, we would need 1 million nuclear power plants.

46
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,080
That's why we also call the Gulf Stream a heat pump.

47
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,920
Without it, the temperature would be significantly colder here, at least 5 to 10 degrees.

48
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,600
Instead of lush fields, we would have long winters and sparse ice-covered landscapes

49
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,360
in Europe.

50
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,860
In the last few years, scientists and pundits in the media have repeatedly expressed the

51
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:42,160
fear that the Gulf Stream could come to a standstill due to climate change.

52
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,040
Because if the polar caps actually melt, the salt content in the water off Greenland

53
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,180
would fall, as would its density.

54
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,440
The North Atlantic Current would no longer be heavy enough, and so it wouldn't sink

55
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,840
as usual.

56
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,880
In the worst case, that would bring the Gulf Stream, our heat pump, to a stop.

57
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:07,860
Some climate experts also assume that climate change could compensate for this effect.

58
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,880
We know that it can be normal for the climate to change by looking at the development of

59
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,080
the Earth over the last few million years.

60
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,520
There are ice ages and warm periods.

61
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,640
In the last ice age, a gigantic flood of melting water crippled the heat-bringing North Atlantic

62
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,800
Current, covering the northern hemisphere in ice.

63
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,600
Scientists have different views on the impact that climate change will have on the global

64
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,400
ocean conveyor belt.

65
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,360
But one thing is clear.

66
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,680
When the climate changes, then the complex system of ocean currents and winds, which

67
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,240
has remained fairly stable since the last ice age, will change in ways that we don't

68
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,320
yet understand.
