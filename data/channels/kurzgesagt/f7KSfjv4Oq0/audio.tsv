0	6560	Let's start this video by throwing a mouse, a dog, and an elephant from a skyscraper onto something soft.
6560	8560	Let's say, a stack of mattresses.
8560	14240	The mouse lands and is stunned for a moment before it shakes itself off and walks away pretty annoyed,
14240	16240	because that's a very rude thing to do.
16240	20160	The dog breaks all of its bones and dies in an unspectacular way,
20160	26080	and the elephant explodes into a red puddle of bones and insides and has no chance to be annoyed.
26320	30080	Why does the mouse survive, but the elephant and dog don't?
30080	32640	The answer is size.
32640	36640	Size is the most underappreciated regulator of living things.
36640	43440	Size determines everything about our biology, how we're built, how we experience the world, how we live and die.
43440	48160	It does so because the physical laws are different for different-sized animals.
48560	59360	Life spans seven orders of magnitude, from invisible bacteria to mites, ants, mice, dogs, humans, elephants, and blue whales.
59360	67120	Every size lives in its own unique universe right next to each other, each with its own rules, upsides, and downsides.
67120	71040	We'll explore these different worlds in a series of videos.
71040	73280	Let's get back to the initial question.
73280	76960	Why did our mouse survive the fall?
76960	83120	Because of how scaling size changes everything, a principle that we'll meet over and over again.
83120	87280	Very small things, for example, are practically immune to falling from great heights,
87280	92080	because the smaller you are, the less you care about the effect of gravity.
92080	95920	Imagine a theoretical spherical animal the size of a marble.
95920	101520	It has three features, its length, its surface area, which is covered in skin, and its volume,
101520	106480	or all the stuff inside it like organs, muscles, hopes, and dreams.
106480	113360	If we make it ten times longer, say the size of a basketball, the rest of its features don't just grow ten times.
113360	120560	Its skin will grow one hundred times, and its insides, or its volume, grows by one thousand times.
120560	125440	The volume determines the weight, or more accurately, mass of the animal.
125440	131680	The more mass you have, the higher your kinetic energy before you hit the ground, and the stronger the impact shock.
131760	135200	The more surface area in relation to your volume or mass you have,
135200	141520	the more the impact gets distributed and softened, and also the more air resistance will slow you down.
141520	146320	An elephant is so big that it has extremely little surface area in ratio to its volume,
146320	152000	so a lot of kinetic energy gets distributed over a small space, and the air doesn't slow it down much at all.
152000	158000	That's why it's completely destroyed in an impressive explosion of goo when it hits the ground.
158000	162880	The other extreme, insects, have a huge surface area in relation to their tiny mass,
162880	167840	so you can literally throw an ant from an airplane, and it will not be seriously harmed.
167840	172640	But while falling is irrelevant in the small world, there are other forces that are harmless for us,
172640	175600	but extremely dangerous for small beings.
175600	181040	Like surface tension, which turns water into a potentially deadly substance for insects.
181040	185200	How does it work? Water has the tendency to stick to itself.
185200	188880	Its molecules are attracted to each other through a force called cohesion,
188880	194240	which creates a tension on its surface that you can imagine as a sort of invisible skin.
194240	198080	For us, this skin is so weak that we don't even notice it normally.
198080	203920	If you get wet, about 800 grams of water or about 1% of your body weight sticks to you.
203920	210160	A wet mouse has about 3 grams of water sticking to it, which is more than 10% of its body weight.
210160	214720	Imagine having eight full water bottles sticking to you when you leave the shower.
214720	218320	But for an insect, the force of water's surface tension is so strong
218320	221840	that getting wet is a question of life and death.
221840	224960	If we were to shrink you to the size of an ant, and you touch water,
224960	227520	it would be like you were reaching into glue.
227520	233040	It would quickly engulf you, its surface tension too hard for you to break, and you'd drown.
233040	236400	So insects evolved to be water repellent.
236400	241440	For one, their exoskeleton is covered with a thin layer of wax, just like a car.
241440	247040	This makes their surface at least partly water repellent because it can't stick to it very well.
247040	251440	Many insects are also covered with tiny hairs that serve as a barrier.
251440	256400	They vastly increase their surface area and prevent the droplets from touching their exoskeleton
256400	259360	and make it easier to get rid of droplets.
259360	265600	To make use of surface tension, evolution cracked nanotechnology billions of years before us.
265600	268480	Some insects have evolved a surface covered by a short
268480	271840	and extremely dense coat of water-repelling hair.
271840	275520	Some have more than a million hairs per square millimeter.
275520	280880	When the insect dives underwater, air stays inside their fur and forms a coat of air.
280880	284960	Water can't enter because the hairs are too tiny to break its surface tension.
284960	286560	But it gets even better.
286560	289040	As the oxygen of the air bubble runs out,
289040	292000	new oxygen diffuses into the bubble from the water around it,
292000	295840	while the carbon dioxide diffuses outwards into the water.
295840	298960	And so the insect carries its own outside lung around
298960	302640	and can basically breathe underwater thanks to surface tension.
302640	306960	This is the same principle that enables pond skaters to walk on water, by the way.
306960	309680	Tiny anti-water hairs.
309680	312640	The smaller you get, the weirder the environment becomes.
312640	316400	At some point, even air becomes more and more solid.
316400	319120	Let's now zoom down to the smallest insects known,
319120	324080	about half the size of a grain of salt, only 0.15 millimeters long.
324080	324960	The fairy fly.
325840	328800	They live in a world even weirder than other insects.
328800	331600	For them, air itself is like thin jello,
331600	333920	a syrup-like mass surrounding them at all times.
334800	336400	Movement through it is not easy.
336960	339920	Flying on this level is not like elegant gliding.
339920	342000	They have to kind of grab and hold onto air.
342720	346800	So their wings look like big hairy arms rather than proper insect wings.
347680	351680	They literally swim through the air like a tiny gross alien through syrup.
352400	354560	Things only become stranger from here on
354560	357280	as we explore more universes of different sizes.
357920	360720	The physical rules are so different for each size
360720	363840	that evolution had to engineer around them over and over
363840	366320	as life grew in size in the last billion years.
367120	369760	So why are there no ants the size of horses?
370640	372560	Why no elephants the size of amoeba?
373440	374400	Why?
374400	376080	We'll discuss this in the next part.
