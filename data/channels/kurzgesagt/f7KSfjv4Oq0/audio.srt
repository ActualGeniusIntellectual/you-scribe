00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
Let's start this video by throwing a mouse, a dog, and an elephant from a skyscraper onto something soft.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,560
Let's say, a stack of mattresses.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:14,240
The mouse lands and is stunned for a moment before it shakes itself off and walks away pretty annoyed,

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,240
because that's a very rude thing to do.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,160
The dog breaks all of its bones and dies in an unspectacular way,

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,080
and the elephant explodes into a red puddle of bones and insides and has no chance to be annoyed.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,080
Why does the mouse survive, but the elephant and dog don't?

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,640
The answer is size.

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,640
Size is the most underappreciated regulator of living things.

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:43,440
Size determines everything about our biology, how we're built, how we experience the world, how we live and die.

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,160
It does so because the physical laws are different for different-sized animals.

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:59,360
Life spans seven orders of magnitude, from invisible bacteria to mites, ants, mice, dogs, humans, elephants, and blue whales.

13
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:07,120
Every size lives in its own unique universe right next to each other, each with its own rules, upsides, and downsides.

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,040
We'll explore these different worlds in a series of videos.

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,280
Let's get back to the initial question.

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,960
Why did our mouse survive the fall?

17
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,120
Because of how scaling size changes everything, a principle that we'll meet over and over again.

18
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,280
Very small things, for example, are practically immune to falling from great heights,

19
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,080
because the smaller you are, the less you care about the effect of gravity.

20
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,920
Imagine a theoretical spherical animal the size of a marble.

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,520
It has three features, its length, its surface area, which is covered in skin, and its volume,

22
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,480
or all the stuff inside it like organs, muscles, hopes, and dreams.

23
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:53,360
If we make it ten times longer, say the size of a basketball, the rest of its features don't just grow ten times.

24
00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:00,560
Its skin will grow one hundred times, and its insides, or its volume, grows by one thousand times.

25
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,440
The volume determines the weight, or more accurately, mass of the animal.

26
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:11,680
The more mass you have, the higher your kinetic energy before you hit the ground, and the stronger the impact shock.

27
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,200
The more surface area in relation to your volume or mass you have,

28
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,520
the more the impact gets distributed and softened, and also the more air resistance will slow you down.

29
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,320
An elephant is so big that it has extremely little surface area in ratio to its volume,

30
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:32,000
so a lot of kinetic energy gets distributed over a small space, and the air doesn't slow it down much at all.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That's why it's completely destroyed in an impressive explosion of goo when it hits the ground.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,880
The other extreme, insects, have a huge surface area in relation to their tiny mass,

33
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,840
so you can literally throw an ant from an airplane, and it will not be seriously harmed.

34
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,640
But while falling is irrelevant in the small world, there are other forces that are harmless for us,

35
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,600
but extremely dangerous for small beings.

36
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:01,040
Like surface tension, which turns water into a potentially deadly substance for insects.

37
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,200
How does it work? Water has the tendency to stick to itself.

38
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,880
Its molecules are attracted to each other through a force called cohesion,

39
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,240
which creates a tension on its surface that you can imagine as a sort of invisible skin.

40
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,080
For us, this skin is so weak that we don't even notice it normally.

41
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,920
If you get wet, about 800 grams of water or about 1% of your body weight sticks to you.

42
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:30,160
A wet mouse has about 3 grams of water sticking to it, which is more than 10% of its body weight.

43
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,720
Imagine having eight full water bottles sticking to you when you leave the shower.

44
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,320
But for an insect, the force of water's surface tension is so strong

45
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,840
that getting wet is a question of life and death.

46
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,960
If we were to shrink you to the size of an ant, and you touch water,

47
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,520
it would be like you were reaching into glue.

48
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:53,040
It would quickly engulf you, its surface tension too hard for you to break, and you'd drown.

49
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,400
So insects evolved to be water repellent.

50
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,440
For one, their exoskeleton is covered with a thin layer of wax, just like a car.

51
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,040
This makes their surface at least partly water repellent because it can't stick to it very well.

52
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,440
Many insects are also covered with tiny hairs that serve as a barrier.

53
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,400
They vastly increase their surface area and prevent the droplets from touching their exoskeleton

54
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,360
and make it easier to get rid of droplets.

55
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:25,600
To make use of surface tension, evolution cracked nanotechnology billions of years before us.

56
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,480
Some insects have evolved a surface covered by a short

57
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,840
and extremely dense coat of water-repelling hair.

58
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,520
Some have more than a million hairs per square millimeter.

59
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,880
When the insect dives underwater, air stays inside their fur and forms a coat of air.

60
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,960
Water can't enter because the hairs are too tiny to break its surface tension.

61
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,560
But it gets even better.

62
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,040
As the oxygen of the air bubble runs out,

63
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,000
new oxygen diffuses into the bubble from the water around it,

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,840
while the carbon dioxide diffuses outwards into the water.

65
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,960
And so the insect carries its own outside lung around

66
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,640
and can basically breathe underwater thanks to surface tension.

67
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,960
This is the same principle that enables pond skaters to walk on water, by the way.

68
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,680
Tiny anti-water hairs.

69
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,640
The smaller you get, the weirder the environment becomes.

70
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,400
At some point, even air becomes more and more solid.

71
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,120
Let's now zoom down to the smallest insects known,

72
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,080
about half the size of a grain of salt, only 0.15 millimeters long.

73
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,960
The fairy fly.

74
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,800
They live in a world even weirder than other insects.

75
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,600
For them, air itself is like thin jello,

76
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,920
a syrup-like mass surrounding them at all times.

77
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,400
Movement through it is not easy.

78
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,920
Flying on this level is not like elegant gliding.

79
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,000
They have to kind of grab and hold onto air.

80
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,800
So their wings look like big hairy arms rather than proper insect wings.

81
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,680
They literally swim through the air like a tiny gross alien through syrup.

82
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,560
Things only become stranger from here on

83
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,280
as we explore more universes of different sizes.

84
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,720
The physical rules are so different for each size

85
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,840
that evolution had to engineer around them over and over

86
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,320
as life grew in size in the last billion years.

87
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,760
So why are there no ants the size of horses?

88
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,560
Why no elephants the size of amoeba?

89
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,400
Why?

90
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,080
We'll discuss this in the next part.

91
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,840
