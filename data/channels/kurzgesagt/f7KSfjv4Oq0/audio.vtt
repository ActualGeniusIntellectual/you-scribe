00:00.000 --> 00:06.560
Let's start this video by throwing a mouse, a dog, and an elephant from a skyscraper onto something soft.

00:06.560 --> 00:08.560
Let's say, a stack of mattresses.

00:08.560 --> 00:14.240
The mouse lands and is stunned for a moment before it shakes itself off and walks away pretty annoyed,

00:14.240 --> 00:16.240
because that's a very rude thing to do.

00:16.240 --> 00:20.160
The dog breaks all of its bones and dies in an unspectacular way,

00:20.160 --> 00:26.080
and the elephant explodes into a red puddle of bones and insides and has no chance to be annoyed.

00:26.320 --> 00:30.080
Why does the mouse survive, but the elephant and dog don't?

00:30.080 --> 00:32.640
The answer is size.

00:32.640 --> 00:36.640
Size is the most underappreciated regulator of living things.

00:36.640 --> 00:43.440
Size determines everything about our biology, how we're built, how we experience the world, how we live and die.

00:43.440 --> 00:48.160
It does so because the physical laws are different for different-sized animals.

00:48.560 --> 00:59.360
Life spans seven orders of magnitude, from invisible bacteria to mites, ants, mice, dogs, humans, elephants, and blue whales.

00:59.360 --> 01:07.120
Every size lives in its own unique universe right next to each other, each with its own rules, upsides, and downsides.

01:07.120 --> 01:11.040
We'll explore these different worlds in a series of videos.

01:11.040 --> 01:13.280
Let's get back to the initial question.

01:13.280 --> 01:16.960
Why did our mouse survive the fall?

01:16.960 --> 01:23.120
Because of how scaling size changes everything, a principle that we'll meet over and over again.

01:23.120 --> 01:27.280
Very small things, for example, are practically immune to falling from great heights,

01:27.280 --> 01:32.080
because the smaller you are, the less you care about the effect of gravity.

01:32.080 --> 01:35.920
Imagine a theoretical spherical animal the size of a marble.

01:35.920 --> 01:41.520
It has three features, its length, its surface area, which is covered in skin, and its volume,

01:41.520 --> 01:46.480
or all the stuff inside it like organs, muscles, hopes, and dreams.

01:46.480 --> 01:53.360
If we make it ten times longer, say the size of a basketball, the rest of its features don't just grow ten times.

01:53.360 --> 02:00.560
Its skin will grow one hundred times, and its insides, or its volume, grows by one thousand times.

02:00.560 --> 02:05.440
The volume determines the weight, or more accurately, mass of the animal.

02:05.440 --> 02:11.680
The more mass you have, the higher your kinetic energy before you hit the ground, and the stronger the impact shock.

02:11.760 --> 02:15.200
The more surface area in relation to your volume or mass you have,

02:15.200 --> 02:21.520
the more the impact gets distributed and softened, and also the more air resistance will slow you down.

02:21.520 --> 02:26.320
An elephant is so big that it has extremely little surface area in ratio to its volume,

02:26.320 --> 02:32.000
so a lot of kinetic energy gets distributed over a small space, and the air doesn't slow it down much at all.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
That's why it's completely destroyed in an impressive explosion of goo when it hits the ground.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.880
The other extreme, insects, have a huge surface area in relation to their tiny mass,

02:42.880 --> 02:47.840
so you can literally throw an ant from an airplane, and it will not be seriously harmed.

02:47.840 --> 02:52.640
But while falling is irrelevant in the small world, there are other forces that are harmless for us,

02:52.640 --> 02:55.600
but extremely dangerous for small beings.

02:55.600 --> 03:01.040
Like surface tension, which turns water into a potentially deadly substance for insects.

03:01.040 --> 03:05.200
How does it work? Water has the tendency to stick to itself.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.880
Its molecules are attracted to each other through a force called cohesion,

03:08.880 --> 03:14.240
which creates a tension on its surface that you can imagine as a sort of invisible skin.

03:14.240 --> 03:18.080
For us, this skin is so weak that we don't even notice it normally.

03:18.080 --> 03:23.920
If you get wet, about 800 grams of water or about 1% of your body weight sticks to you.

03:23.920 --> 03:30.160
A wet mouse has about 3 grams of water sticking to it, which is more than 10% of its body weight.

03:30.160 --> 03:34.720
Imagine having eight full water bottles sticking to you when you leave the shower.

03:34.720 --> 03:38.320
But for an insect, the force of water's surface tension is so strong

03:38.320 --> 03:41.840
that getting wet is a question of life and death.

03:41.840 --> 03:44.960
If we were to shrink you to the size of an ant, and you touch water,

03:44.960 --> 03:47.520
it would be like you were reaching into glue.

03:47.520 --> 03:53.040
It would quickly engulf you, its surface tension too hard for you to break, and you'd drown.

03:53.040 --> 03:56.400
So insects evolved to be water repellent.

03:56.400 --> 04:01.440
For one, their exoskeleton is covered with a thin layer of wax, just like a car.

04:01.440 --> 04:07.040
This makes their surface at least partly water repellent because it can't stick to it very well.

04:07.040 --> 04:11.440
Many insects are also covered with tiny hairs that serve as a barrier.

04:11.440 --> 04:16.400
They vastly increase their surface area and prevent the droplets from touching their exoskeleton

04:16.400 --> 04:19.360
and make it easier to get rid of droplets.

04:19.360 --> 04:25.600
To make use of surface tension, evolution cracked nanotechnology billions of years before us.

04:25.600 --> 04:28.480
Some insects have evolved a surface covered by a short

04:28.480 --> 04:31.840
and extremely dense coat of water-repelling hair.

04:31.840 --> 04:35.520
Some have more than a million hairs per square millimeter.

04:35.520 --> 04:40.880
When the insect dives underwater, air stays inside their fur and forms a coat of air.

04:40.880 --> 04:44.960
Water can't enter because the hairs are too tiny to break its surface tension.

04:44.960 --> 04:46.560
But it gets even better.

04:46.560 --> 04:49.040
As the oxygen of the air bubble runs out,

04:49.040 --> 04:52.000
new oxygen diffuses into the bubble from the water around it,

04:52.000 --> 04:55.840
while the carbon dioxide diffuses outwards into the water.

04:55.840 --> 04:58.960
And so the insect carries its own outside lung around

04:58.960 --> 05:02.640
and can basically breathe underwater thanks to surface tension.

05:02.640 --> 05:06.960
This is the same principle that enables pond skaters to walk on water, by the way.

05:06.960 --> 05:09.680
Tiny anti-water hairs.

05:09.680 --> 05:12.640
The smaller you get, the weirder the environment becomes.

05:12.640 --> 05:16.400
At some point, even air becomes more and more solid.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.120
Let's now zoom down to the smallest insects known,

05:19.120 --> 05:24.080
about half the size of a grain of salt, only 0.15 millimeters long.

05:24.080 --> 05:24.960
The fairy fly.

05:25.840 --> 05:28.800
They live in a world even weirder than other insects.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.600
For them, air itself is like thin jello,

05:31.600 --> 05:33.920
a syrup-like mass surrounding them at all times.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.400
Movement through it is not easy.

05:36.960 --> 05:39.920
Flying on this level is not like elegant gliding.

05:39.920 --> 05:42.000
They have to kind of grab and hold onto air.

05:42.720 --> 05:46.800
So their wings look like big hairy arms rather than proper insect wings.

05:47.680 --> 05:51.680
They literally swim through the air like a tiny gross alien through syrup.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.560
Things only become stranger from here on

05:54.560 --> 05:57.280
as we explore more universes of different sizes.

05:57.920 --> 06:00.720
The physical rules are so different for each size

06:00.720 --> 06:03.840
that evolution had to engineer around them over and over

06:03.840 --> 06:06.320
as life grew in size in the last billion years.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.760
So why are there no ants the size of horses?

06:10.640 --> 06:12.560
Why no elephants the size of amoeba?

06:13.440 --> 06:14.400
Why?

06:14.400 --> 06:16.080
We'll discuss this in the next part.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.840
