0	1400	How lasers work.
1400	5200	Laser beams are high-energy light beams that can be focused very tightly.
5200	9900	But what's cool is that all photons in a laser beam have the exact same frequency, or tone,
9900	11500	much like a choir of light.
11500	12800	But who are the singers?
12800	14900	Atoms can have different levels of energy.
14900	18300	In their lowest energy state, they can absorb energy to get excited.
18300	21100	If a photon with the right frequency bumps into an excited atom,
21100	24800	the atom will release a perfect copy of the first photon before relaxing again,
24800	27600	like a singer that sings along to the tune of the photon.
27700	31700	Now, to create a choir of cloned photons, we only need three things.
31700	33700	One, a box of excited atoms.
33700	34900	Two, mirrors.
34900	37200	Three, and one photon to begin with.
37200	39600	The photon enters the box, gets cloned,
39600	42200	the mirrors send them back at the atoms over and over again.
42200	46900	The original photon gets multiplied that way until the beam is released through a hole in the box.
46900	50800	When the first light choir, sorry, laser, was built in 1960,
50800	54100	it was jokingly coined a solution in search of a problem.
54100	56400	But nowadays, lasers are used everywhere.
56400	58500	A choir that sings with light.
58500	59700	That's basically.
