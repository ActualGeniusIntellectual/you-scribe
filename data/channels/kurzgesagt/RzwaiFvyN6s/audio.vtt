00:00.000 --> 00:01.400
How lasers work.

00:01.400 --> 00:05.200
Laser beams are high-energy light beams that can be focused very tightly.

00:05.200 --> 00:09.900
But what's cool is that all photons in a laser beam have the exact same frequency, or tone,

00:09.900 --> 00:11.500
much like a choir of light.

00:11.500 --> 00:12.800
But who are the singers?

00:12.800 --> 00:14.900
Atoms can have different levels of energy.

00:14.900 --> 00:18.300
In their lowest energy state, they can absorb energy to get excited.

00:18.300 --> 00:21.100
If a photon with the right frequency bumps into an excited atom,

00:21.100 --> 00:24.800
the atom will release a perfect copy of the first photon before relaxing again,

00:24.800 --> 00:27.600
like a singer that sings along to the tune of the photon.

00:27.700 --> 00:31.700
Now, to create a choir of cloned photons, we only need three things.

00:31.700 --> 00:33.700
One, a box of excited atoms.

00:33.700 --> 00:34.900
Two, mirrors.

00:34.900 --> 00:37.200
Three, and one photon to begin with.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.600
The photon enters the box, gets cloned,

00:39.600 --> 00:42.200
the mirrors send them back at the atoms over and over again.

00:42.200 --> 00:46.900
The original photon gets multiplied that way until the beam is released through a hole in the box.

00:46.900 --> 00:50.800
When the first light choir, sorry, laser, was built in 1960,

00:50.800 --> 00:54.100
it was jokingly coined a solution in search of a problem.

00:54.100 --> 00:56.400
But nowadays, lasers are used everywhere.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.500
A choir that sings with light.

00:58.500 --> 00:59.700
That's basically.
