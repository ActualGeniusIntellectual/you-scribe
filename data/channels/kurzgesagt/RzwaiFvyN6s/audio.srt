00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
How lasers work.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:05,200
Laser beams are high-energy light beams that can be focused very tightly.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,900
But what's cool is that all photons in a laser beam have the exact same frequency, or tone,

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,500
much like a choir of light.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,800
But who are the singers?

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,900
Atoms can have different levels of energy.

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,300
In their lowest energy state, they can absorb energy to get excited.

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,100
If a photon with the right frequency bumps into an excited atom,

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,800
the atom will release a perfect copy of the first photon before relaxing again,

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,600
like a singer that sings along to the tune of the photon.

11
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,700
Now, to create a choir of cloned photons, we only need three things.

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,700
One, a box of excited atoms.

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,900
Two, mirrors.

14
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,200
Three, and one photon to begin with.

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,600
The photon enters the box, gets cloned,

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,200
the mirrors send them back at the atoms over and over again.

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,900
The original photon gets multiplied that way until the beam is released through a hole in the box.

18
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,800
When the first light choir, sorry, laser, was built in 1960,

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,100
it was jokingly coined a solution in search of a problem.

20
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,400
But nowadays, lasers are used everywhere.

21
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,500
A choir that sings with light.

22
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,700
That's basically.
