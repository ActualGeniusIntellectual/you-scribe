0	2880	Bleurgh, you swallowed a tapeworm by accident.
2880	3760	What now?
3760	7520	Maybe you ate infected raw meat or perhaps you drank contaminated water.
7520	9120	Well, that's less important now.
9120	10320	They're in your body.
10320	13680	How bad it might get depends on whether it's a larva or an egg.
13680	15280	Option one, larvae.
15280	18480	Once in your intestine, the larva bites into your intestinal wall,
18480	22000	where it could spend the next 25 years growing up to 8 meters long,
22000	24240	eating what you eat and laying eggs.
24240	26480	Unless you notice the egg sacs in the toilet,
26480	29040	you probably wouldn't even know you had a parasite.
29040	32480	You and your new friend, Jogen, will peacefully coexist now.
32480	34080	Option two, egg.
34080	37600	The eggs need to feast on something, so they don't stay in your gut.
37600	39280	Instead, they get into your bloodstream,
39280	42560	then force their way into muscles, developing into the larvae.
42560	45520	Except, sometimes the eggs get into your brain,
45520	49040	where they can cause all sorts of problems by chewing it up.
49040	52480	This makes them a leading cause of epilepsy worldwide.
52480	57280	Fortunately, the treatment for both options is literally a single pill, taken just once.
57280	59600	The real cure is better sanitation.
