1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Bleurgh, you swallowed a tapeworm by accident.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,760
What now?

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,520
Maybe you ate infected raw meat or perhaps you drank contaminated water.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,120
Well, that's less important now.

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,320
They're in your body.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,680
How bad it might get depends on whether it's a larva or an egg.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,280
Option one, larvae.

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,480
Once in your intestine, the larva bites into your intestinal wall,

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,000
where it could spend the next 25 years growing up to 8 meters long,

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,240
eating what you eat and laying eggs.

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,480
Unless you notice the egg sacs in the toilet,

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,040
you probably wouldn't even know you had a parasite.

13
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,480
You and your new friend, Jogen, will peacefully coexist now.

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,080
Option two, egg.

15
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,600
The eggs need to feast on something, so they don't stay in your gut.

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,280
Instead, they get into your bloodstream,

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,560
then force their way into muscles, developing into the larvae.

18
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,520
Except, sometimes the eggs get into your brain,

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,040
where they can cause all sorts of problems by chewing it up.

20
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,480
This makes them a leading cause of epilepsy worldwide.

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,280
Fortunately, the treatment for both options is literally a single pill, taken just once.

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,600
The real cure is better sanitation.
