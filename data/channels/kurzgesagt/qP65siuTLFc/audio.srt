Cooking a chicken with a particle accelerator? How would that work?

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,480
First, we need a raw chicken. That's easy. Then, we need a particle accelerator.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,040
So, let's put a chicken in it. To avoid collisions between air molecules and beam particles,

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,640
we have to pump out all the air in the beam pipe before we even turn it on.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,560
As the air pressure drops to near vacuum, moisture and other molecules vaporize,

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,200
leaving the outer layer of the chicken dried and brittle.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,960
Then, as we cool down the magnet, any water remaining freezes.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,640
When the beam is turned on, magnetic fields focus it to the width of a hair,

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,320
so it only collides with a narrow strand of chicken, but it completely obliterates

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,480
every atom in its way. The tremendous energy of the collisions burns the meat around it,

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,320
or it would, if there were any oxygen for it to burn, and the space around this hole

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,520
doesn't stay raw. Rather, it becomes radioactive. When we finally pull our chicken out of the

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,400
accelerator, it's not exactly raw, but it's certainly not cooked. You can take a bite

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,960
once it thaws. But we're not fans of food poisoning or radiation poisoning, so we can't recommend.
