0	3600	Cooking a chicken with a particle accelerator? How would that work?
3600	8480	First, we need a raw chicken. That's easy. Then, we need a particle accelerator.
8480	13040	So, let's put a chicken in it. To avoid collisions between air molecules and beam particles,
13040	16640	we have to pump out all the air in the beam pipe before we even turn it on.
16640	20560	As the air pressure drops to near vacuum, moisture and other molecules vaporize,
20560	23200	leaving the outer layer of the chicken dried and brittle.
23200	26960	Then, as we cool down the magnet, any water remaining freezes.
26960	30640	When the beam is turned on, magnetic fields focus it to the width of a hair,
30640	34320	so it only collides with a narrow strand of chicken, but it completely obliterates
34320	38480	every atom in its way. The tremendous energy of the collisions burns the meat around it,
38480	42320	or it would, if there were any oxygen for it to burn, and the space around this hole
42320	47520	doesn't stay raw. Rather, it becomes radioactive. When we finally pull our chicken out of the
47520	52400	accelerator, it's not exactly raw, but it's certainly not cooked. You can take a bite
52400	58960	once it thaws. But we're not fans of food poisoning or radiation poisoning, so we can't recommend.
