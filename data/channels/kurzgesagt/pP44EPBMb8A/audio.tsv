0	4000	Human history is told by the energy we use.
4000	9000	At first we had to use our muscles, then we learned to control fire.
9000	16000	We industrialized the world using coal and oil and entered the atomic age when we learned how to split a nucleus.
16000	23000	At each step we increased our energy harvest to a scale never seen before and advanced as a species.
23000	31000	Currently, we're slowly transitioning to renewables and if we're lucky, fusion energy will become viable in the future.
31000	40000	As humanity progresses further, if we don't destroy ourselves or our habitat, we will likely gain complete control of our planet's resources.
40000	46000	At that stage, we'll probably begin to look outwards for new places to expand into.
46000	54000	But space is hard and establishing a serious human presence in the solar system will require ungodly amounts of energy.
54000	57000	Luckily, we know where to find it.
57000	60000	The Sun, the ultimate source of energy.
60000	66000	A furnace 100 quintillion times more powerful than our most efficient nuclear reactor.
66000	71000	It shines with the energy of a trillion nuclear bombs per second.
71000	76000	So how do we get this energy? Not some of it, all of it.
85000	92000	If we want to collect the most energy physically possible, we'll have to build the largest, most ambitious structure in the universe.
92000	99000	The Dyson Sphere, a megastructure that encompasses a whole star to capture its power output.
99000	106000	For an intelligent species, building a Dyson Sphere is a technological leap on a par with the discovery of fire for our ancestors.
106000	111000	The transition from a planetary species to an interstellar species.
111000	117000	It would usher in an age of exploration and expansion on a scale we can barely imagine.
117000	119000	So, what would it look like?
119000	123000	A solid shell enveloping the Sun is probably not the way to go.
123000	128000	A large rigid body like that would be vulnerable to impacts, possibly shattering.
128000	132000	It would be liable to drift and could crash straight into the Sun.
132000	142000	A more viable design for a Dyson Sphere might be a Dyson Swarm, an enormous set of orbiting panels that collect the Sun's power and beam it elsewhere.
142000	146000	Such a swarm would give humanity basically unlimited energy.
146000	149000	But building it won't be easy.
149000	153000	The Sun is very big, so we need a lot of satellites.
153000	159000	If each satellite is a square kilometer, we'd need around 30 quadrillion to surround the Sun.
159000	165000	Even if they're built as lightly as possible, we need about 100 quintillion tons of material.
165000	172000	And then we need the energy to actually put the parts together and deliver them to their positions around the Sun.
172000	178000	On top of all that, we need to have a permanent infrastructure set up in space to start building.
178000	185000	Let's assume for the purposes of this video that our descendants will take care of that and want to create the megastructure.
185000	188000	We can sort the challenges into three main categories.
188000	191000	Materials, design, and energy.
191000	199000	To get the vast amounts of raw materials required for our Dyson Swarm, we'll have to largely disassemble a whole planet.
199000	202000	Of the planets available, Mercury is the best candidate.
202000	206000	It's the closest to the Sun and very metal-rich.
206000	209000	Close to the Sun also means less moving stuff around.
209000	218000	And Mercury has no atmosphere and only about a third of the surface gravity of Earth, making it comparatively easy to launch material into space.
218000	221000	Next, we should consider the design of our Swarm.
221000	223000	Simpler is better.
223000	227000	Conventional solar panels are far too intricate and short-lived.
227000	235000	Our satellites need to operate without repairs or intervention for astronomically long times, and they need to be cheap to produce.
235000	244000	They're most likely going to be enormous mirrors, which refocus sunlight to central collecting stations, like in concentrated solar power on Earth.
244000	252000	To build and launch them efficiently, they must be incredibly light, made of little more than polished metal foil bound to some supports.
252000	256000	And last, we need the energy to build and launch the Swarm itself.
256000	262000	Taking apart a planet and launching things into space requires an enormous amount of energy.
262000	272000	For example, if we used all the fossil fuels and uranium on Earth, and we were perfectly efficient, we could only launch as much mass as Mount Everest into space.
272000	276000	A rather meager accomplishment compared to planetary disassembly.
276000	283000	To get the energy needed to build a Dyson Sphere, it's almost as if you're going to need the power output of a Dyson Sphere.
283000	288000	But that's okay. There's plenty of sunlight to be had on Mercury, so let's get to work.
288000	296000	Humans are expensive to keep alive and are very sensitive to the environment, so we'd want to automate as much as possible.
296000	303000	Ideally, we'd have a small crew of controllers who oversee an army of autonomous machines doing the actual work.
303000	311000	There are four major pieces of technology required. Solar collectors, miners, refiners, and launch equipment.
311000	316000	The solar collectors are going to give us the energy we need to disassemble the planet.
316000	323000	To start, maybe we deploy something like one square kilometer of them, either as mirrors or as traditional solar panels.
323000	333000	They'll provide the energy to run our miners, which strip-mine the surface of the planet, and our refiners, which extract valuable elements and fabricate them into our Swarm satellites.
333000	338000	To get them into space, we need a creative and efficient solution.
338000	342000	Rockets are too expensive and difficult to de-orbit and reuse.
342000	350000	Instead, we'll want to use a sort of railgun, a long, electromagnetic track which launches our satellites at high speeds.
350000	357000	Our Swarm satellites would be packed tight for launch, unfurling like an enormous origami once in orbit.
357000	368000	From this point, we can take advantage of exponential growth, using the energy of the existing parts of the Swarm to build more infrastructure on Mercury and launch new panels faster and faster.
368000	377000	Each panel provides the energy to build another. Those two work together to build the next two. Four become eight, eight become sixteen, and so on.
377000	383000	Within just about 60 doubling times, the Sun would be completely surrounded by solar panels.
383000	390000	And this can happen quickly. If a square kilometer of solar collectors takes a month to build, we could be done in a decade.
390000	395000	If only our infrastructure on the planet's surface can keep up with the quickly growing budget of energy.
395000	402000	Even collecting 1% of the Sun's energy is an unbelievable change in our species' energy budget.
402000	409000	We could create the infrastructure to beam basically unlimited amounts of energy around the solar system for all sorts of projects.
409000	417000	Colonies on other worlds, terraforming planets, constructing more megastructures, or even traveling to other stars.
417000	426000	It could be the start of an interstellar civilization. Based on physics alone, this is not just possible, but easy.
426000	437000	It's such a simple process and such a necessary step for any species to expand beyond their home planet that many astronomers think there are probably Dyson spheres already out there in the Milky Way.
437000	441000	We haven't spotted any yet, but they could be there.
441000	445000	It's far from certain that humanity will ever get to this point.
445000	451000	Our attention is too often focused on short-term political gains and conflicts that will not matter in the long run.
451000	461000	But if we survive the challenges we've set ourselves, we could potentially become the first species in the universe to create a structure with the scope of a star.
461000	466000	If we do it, the only limitation left will be our own imagination.
466000	473000	We've just hit you with a lot of pretty wild claims and crazy concepts.
473000	482000	If you're like us and enjoy using the power of science to determine absurd ways to destroy stuff, you might want to hear how you can come up with something like that yourself.
