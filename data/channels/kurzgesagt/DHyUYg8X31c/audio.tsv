0	6420	Imagine a future where your toaster anticipates what kind of toast you want.
6420	10940	During the day, it scans the internet for new and exciting types of toast.
10940	16540	Maybe it asks you about your day and wants to chat about new achievements in toast technology.
16540	22260	At what level would it become a person? At which point will you ask yourself if your
22260	28500	toaster has feelings? If it did, would unplugging it be murder? And would you still own it?
29460	32580	Will we someday be forced to give our machines rights?
43140	48340	AI is already all around you. It makes sure discounters are stocked with enough snacks,
48340	52900	it serves you up just the right internet ad, and you may have even read a news story written
52900	59140	entirely by a machine. Right now, we look at chatbots like Siri and laugh at their primitive
59140	64740	simulated emotions, but it's likely that we will have to deal with beings that make it hard to draw
64740	71380	the line between real and simulated humanity. Are there any machines in existence that deserve
71380	79540	rights? Most likely not yet. But if they come, we are not prepared for it. Much of the philosophy
79540	84980	of rights is ill-equipped to deal with the case of artificial intelligence. Most claims for rights,
84980	90660	whether human or animal, are centered around the question of consciousness. Unfortunately,
90660	95940	nobody knows what consciousness is. Some think that it's immaterial, others say it's a state
95940	102820	of matter like gas or liquid. Regardless of the precise definition, we have an intuitive knowledge
102820	108740	of consciousness because we experience it. We're aware of ourselves and our surroundings and know
108740	115460	what unconsciousness feels like. Some neuroscientists believe that any sufficiently advanced system
115460	121060	can generate consciousness. So if your toaster's hardware was powerful enough, it may become
121060	129620	self-aware. If it does, would it deserve rights? Well, not so fast. Would what we define as rights
129620	135940	make sense to it? Consciousness entitles beings to have rights because it gives a being the ability
135940	143700	to suffer. It means the ability to not only feel pain but to be aware of it. Robots don't suffer
143700	150260	and they probably won't unless we program them to. Without pain or pleasure, there's no preference
150260	156420	and rights are meaningless. Our human rights are deeply tied to our own programming.
157140	162900	For example, we dislike pain because our brains evolved to keep us alive, to stop us from touching
162900	169060	a hot fire or to make us run away from predators. So we came up with rights that protect us from
169060	174660	infringements that cause us pain. Even more abstract rights like freedom are rooted in the
174660	182420	way our brains are wired to detect what is fair and unfair. Would a toaster that is unable to move
182420	187940	mind being locked in a cage? Would it mind being dismantled if it had no fear of death?
188900	192500	Would it mind being insulted if it had no need for self-esteem?
193780	199780	But what if we programmed a robot to feel pain and emotions? To prefer justice over injustice,
199780	204260	pleasure over pain, and be aware of it. Would that make them sufficiently human?
205220	210740	Many technologists believe that an explosion in technology will occur when artificial intelligence
210740	215620	can learn and create their own artificial intelligences even smarter than themselves.
216420	221060	At this point, the question of how robots are programmed will be largely out of our control.
222260	227060	What if an artificial intelligence found it necessary to program the ability to feel pain
227060	233220	just as evolutionary biology found it necessary in most living creatures? Do robots deserve those
233220	239220	rights? But maybe we should be less worried about the risk that super intelligent robots pose to us
239220	244900	and more worried about the danger we pose to them. Our whole human identity is based on the
245300	251300	idea of human exceptionalism, that we are special, unique snowflakes entitled to dominate the natural
251300	257060	world. Humans have a history of denying that other beings are capable of suffering as they do.
257700	263060	In the midst of the scientific revolution, many Descartes argued that animals were mere automata,
263060	268980	robots if you will. As such, injuring a rabbit was about as morally repugnant as punching a
268980	274420	stuffed animal. And many of the greatest crimes against humanity were justified by their
274420	280580	perpetrators on the grounds that the victims were more animal than civilized human. Even more
280580	286580	problematic is that we have an economic interest in denying robot rights. If we can coerce a
286580	292180	sentient AI possibly through programmed torture into doing as we please, the economic potential
292180	298580	is unlimited. We've done it before, after all. Violence has been used to force our fellow humans
298580	303380	into working, and we've never had trouble coming up with ideological justifications.
304820	310260	Slave owners argued that slavery benefited the slaves. It put a roof over their head and taught
310260	316020	them Christianity. Men who were against women voting argued that it was in women's own interest
316020	322340	to leave the hard decisions to men. Farmers argued that looking after animals and feeding them
322340	325300	justifies their early death for our dietary preferences.
327620	332180	If robots become sentient, there will be no shortage of arguments for those who say that
332180	336260	they should remain without rights, especially from those who stand to profit from it.
337700	341940	Artificial intelligence raises serious questions about philosophical boundaries.
342660	346740	While we may ask if sentient robots are conscious or deserving of rights,
346740	352900	it forces us to pose basic questions like what makes us human? What makes us deserving of rights?
354740	358820	Regardless of what we think, the question might need to be resolved in the near future.
359620	363060	What are we going to do if robots start demanding their own rights?
367220	371940	What can robots demanding rights teach us about ourselves? Our friends at Wisecrack
371940	375940	made a video exploring this very question using the philosophy of Westworld.
