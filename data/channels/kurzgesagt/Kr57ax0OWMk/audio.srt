1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,600
Few of the monsters that evolution created have been so successful at hurting us

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,640
as the variola virus, responsible for smallpox.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,560
The carnage it caused was so terrible and merciless

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,640
that it compelled humankind, for the first time, to act truly globally.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,360
It was one of the greatest wins of our species over the ancient powers of nature,

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,600
all made possible by cows.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,040
Variola is a virus, a tiny machine that only seeks to reproduce itself.

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,080
Evidence of it has been found in Egyptian mummies

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,120
and in writing for India and China as old as 3,000 years.

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,240
1,300 years ago, smallpox killed up to a third of Japan's population.

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,120
By the 1600s, it was one of the major causes of death worldwide.

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,400
In late 18th century Europe, it killed 400,000 a year.

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,240
Every third person who went blind did so because of this virus.

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,160
Even in the 20th century, a hot second ago in history,

15
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,400
it still killed at least 300 million people.

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,680
Smallpox is an abusive monster that returns over and over and over again,

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,880
killing, maiming and disrupting societies.

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,960
How could variola be so incredibly deadly for so long

19
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,520
and how could we have forgotten its horror so quickly?

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,120
In 2023, there are only two laboratories left

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,920
where the living virus is officially stored for research

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,360
in Kosovo, Russia and Atlanta, USA.

23
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,800
Which is certainly a good idea because what could possibly go wrong?

24
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,480
Let's say that through an unfortunate series of events,

25
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,120
the virus got out and you got infected.

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,080
What would happen to you?

27
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,640
How smallpox kills.

28
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,400
Variola is highly infectious and catches a ride in small droplets you breathe in.

29
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,440
Immediately, it begins to infect the cells that line your throat

30
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,280
and starts killing them to cause chaos.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,500
Why?

32
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,600
To trick your body into giving it a lift.

33
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,800
Whenever cells in your body die a violent death,

34
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,720
your immune cells immediately stream to the site of infection to help out.

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,760
In this case, that backfires horribly.

36
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,720
As immune cells begin cleaning up dead cells, eating viruses and killing infected cells,

37
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,920
variola infects a crucial cell of your immune system,

38
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,160
your dendritic cells, intelligence cells that gather information

39
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,920
and leave the battlefield to get help.

40
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,880
They enter your lymphatic system, a highway network that spans your entire body

41
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,960
and connects hundreds of immune bases.

42
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,480
In these bases, your heavy defenses are activated

43
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,440
and should be the last place an enemy would want to invade,

44
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,440
but variola wants to get here.

45
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,560
For about 12 days, the virus quietly infects civilian and immune cells,

46
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,520
jumping from cell to cell, infecting more and more of them.

47
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,200
At some point, a critical threshold is reached and variola starts its attack for real.

48
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,240
Millions of viruses use the lymphatic highway to spill into your blood and organs,

49
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,680
infecting your whole body.

50
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,200
Suddenly, variola is everywhere.

51
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,560
But despite this global attack, your adaptive immune system is struggling to wake up.

52
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,640
Your immune cells look for and use critical transmitters called interferons

53
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,560
to mobilize the body against viruses.

54
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,880
Interferons, as the name suggests, interfere, significantly slowing down virus infections,

55
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,840
but also quickly activating millions of antivirus weapons.

56
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,080
But variola is able to deactivate interferons,

57
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,880
which stuns the antivirus side of your defense system.

58
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,640
Other systems would usually help, like the complement system,

59
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,760
a sort of mobile minefield that can destroy viruses.

60
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,240
But variola manages to shut this down too.

61
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,400
And so, with little resistance, variola spreads everywhere.

62
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,440
And infects billions of your cells all over your body.

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,080
Among the infected are your capillaries,

64
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,360
the smallest blood vessels in your body, which die in great numbers.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,760
All this death activates an immune cell that you really don't need right now,

66
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,320
but that's attracted by death, the neutrophil.

67
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,680
Normally, an efficient killer of invaders great and small,

68
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,160
it's not very effective against smallpox.

69
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,160
And even worse, neutrophils fight by vomiting deadly chemicals,

70
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,000
which kills even more of your cells.

71
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,200
On top of that, they order inflammation,

72
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,320
fluids streaming from your blood vessels into your tissue.

73
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,240
All over your body, as first millions then billions of your cells die,

74
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,480
you get a rash that only gets worse and worse.

75
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,840
Pus and cellular junk fills it up as your body swells up with hundreds of lesions

76
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,360
all over your skin and inside, even on your organs,

77
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,240
all filled with billions of variola viruses.

78
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,280
Now, the critical phase begins.

79
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,480
As you fight for survival, you burn up in a high fever.

80
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,880
Thousands of battlegrounds drain your blood of fluid

81
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,800
that streams into your tissue and organs.

82
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,280
Blood clotting appears all over your body,

83
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,280
while floods of toxins from dead cells build up and can cause organs to fail.

84
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,120
Your lungs fill up with fluid, making it harder and harder to breathe.

85
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,440
One of two things happens now.

86
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,080
Either your immune system wrestles back control,

87
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,960
heavy weapons have been dispatched, killing infected cells,

88
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,520
cleaning up the thousands of infections one by one,

89
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,680
killing variola wherever it can be found, so you can slowly begin to recover.

90
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,840
The immune system will forever remember variola, making you immune forever.

91
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,560
Or you die, overwhelmed by the infection,

92
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,760
and your immune system's panicked reaction to the body-wide infection.

93
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,680
About a third of people who contract smallpox don't survive.

94
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,640
And if you survive, you're very likely branded by scars

95
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,800
and may even lose your eyesight or hearing.

96
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,800
For thousands of years, this terrible disease ravaged the world,

97
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,880
leaving death and destruction traumatized and maimed survivors.

98
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,040
Until one day, humanity said,

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,360
Smallpox is one of the worst diseases humanity has ever known.

100
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,560
A murderous, family-destroying, life-ruining monster.

101
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,280
There was nothing you could do for the infected,

102
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,160
but people noticed that if you survived, you were immune.

103
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,360
So out of desperation, they came up with the dangerous practice of variolation.

104
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,280
Take scabs from an infected person that had a mild case of smallpox,

105
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,240
let them dry out, and grind them to a fine powder.

106
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,880
Then blow the powder up the nostril of a patient or scratch their skin with it.

107
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,080
If things went well, they only got a mild version of smallpox

108
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,920
and gained immunity against the disease.

109
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,480
Variolation probably worked because it introduced variola in a part of the body

110
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,920
the virus wasn't prepared for, disabling most of its nasty tricks.

111
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,960
And because the inoculation was left to dry out,

112
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,480
that damaged the virus so it couldn't cause the full disease.

113
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,280
Unfortunately, two to three percent of all patients still died

114
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,800
because they got the smallpox or suffered other diseases as a result of treatment.

115
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,680
Still, smallpox was such a horrible and to some degree unavoidable disease

116
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,320
that people took the risk for themselves and their children.

117
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,360
Variolation spread around the globe, while variola continued to kill millions.

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,280
A victory over the virus only became a real possibility

119
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,160
when scientists realized that it wasn't necessary to variolate with the real smallpox disease,

120
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,520
but much safer to use material from cowpox, a variant that affected, surprise, cows.

121
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,760
A truly revolutionary step, and only a few years later,

122
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,600
this led to one of humankind's most outstanding achievements, vaccinations.

123
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,440
The innovation was simple.

124
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,200
Instead of using the real virus to train the immune system,

125
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,680
use a related virus, cowpox, that was only mild but also gave you immunity.

126
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,360
Still, it would take another 200 years, countless individuals fighting the monster where they could,

127
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,240
delivering vaccines to the most remote places on earth,

128
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,920
all the while the disease ravaged on, killing over 300 million people in the 20th century alone.

129
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,640
In 1966, the World Health Organization

130
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,080
decided that humanity had to come together in a final major effort.

131
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,760
A global smallpox news network based on residents in hotspots was created,

132
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,680
tackling local outbreaks of the virus.

133
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,240
Cases were encircled, vaccines given, preventing further spread.

134
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,160
Smallpox only infects humans, so if we stopped the human transmission chain,

135
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,520
we would starve the virus.

136
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,600
The last naturally occurring infection was in 1977,

137
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,680
and in 1980, just shy of 200 years since the first vaccine was used,

138
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,240
smallpox was declared eradicated.

139
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,440
Variola, the scourge of humanity, was dead.

140
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,880
No more children would be killed by it, no more mothers or brothers or uncles or cousins.

141
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,880
It's hard to convey to people around today what an incredible win this was.

142
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,480
One of the cruelest, most dangerous monsters that has hunted us

143
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:37,360
for literally millennia was slain by us, apes with pointy needles.

144
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,200
Today, we live in a time of enlightenment.

145
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,160
None of us alive today are haunted by the specter of smallpox.

146
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,560
This light is not natural.

147
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,080
It was set in the sky by the sheer will of humankind,

148
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,400
wanting to be safe from the monsters haunting us.

149
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,240
But because we live without them, we forget that they ever existed and that they are real.

150
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,120
That the diseases might reawaken, or new ones might be brewing in jungles,

151
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,880
wet markets or laboratories, ready to strike us once more.

152
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,120
We forget what an incredible gift vaccines are, and how hard we had to battle to get them.

153
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,840
We are still protected by the light, but it's cooling each and every day,

154
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,080
and we owe it to those who will come after us to make sure it doesn't go out.

155
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,520
We killed one monster. We can do it again.

156
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,600
This video was supported by Open Philanthropy.

157
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,920
Do you want to continue learning about the fascinating world of biology?

158
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,120
We've got you.

159
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,520
Let's take a real close look at the human body.

160
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,160
This is an arm, and this is a human cell.

161
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,720
The microscopic stage where everything happens.

162
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,840
Where all the important battles are fought and where you are constantly built over and over again.

163
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,080
Even though it's the smallest unit of life, the cell is extremely complex.

164
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,920
But don't worry, we managed to fit everything you need to know on a single poster.

165
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,440
And in true Kurzgesagt fashion, it's easy to understand and even easier on the eyes.

166
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,360
Grasping a complex topic is much easier when it's presented in exciting ways.

167
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,000
The poster was researched and designed in collaboration with molecular biologist James Gurney,
