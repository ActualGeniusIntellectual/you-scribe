880	5600	Few of the monsters that evolution created have been so successful at hurting us
5600	8640	as the variola virus, responsible for smallpox.
9280	12560	The carnage it caused was so terrible and merciless
12560	16640	that it compelled humankind, for the first time, to act truly globally.
17280	21360	It was one of the greatest wins of our species over the ancient powers of nature,
21360	23600	all made possible by cows.
30960	37040	Variola is a virus, a tiny machine that only seeks to reproduce itself.
37680	40080	Evidence of it has been found in Egyptian mummies
40080	43120	and in writing for India and China as old as 3,000 years.
43840	48240	1,300 years ago, smallpox killed up to a third of Japan's population.
48800	53120	By the 1600s, it was one of the major causes of death worldwide.
53120	56400	In late 18th century Europe, it killed 400,000 a year.
57040	60240	Every third person who went blind did so because of this virus.
60880	64160	Even in the 20th century, a hot second ago in history,
64160	66400	it still killed at least 300 million people.
66960	71680	Smallpox is an abusive monster that returns over and over and over again,
71680	74880	killing, maiming and disrupting societies.
75680	78960	How could variola be so incredibly deadly for so long
78960	81520	and how could we have forgotten its horror so quickly?
82240	85120	In 2023, there are only two laboratories left
85120	87920	where the living virus is officially stored for research
87920	91360	in Kosovo, Russia and Atlanta, USA.
91360	94800	Which is certainly a good idea because what could possibly go wrong?
95520	98480	Let's say that through an unfortunate series of events,
98480	101120	the virus got out and you got infected.
101120	102080	What would happen to you?
103200	104640	How smallpox kills.
106080	110400	Variola is highly infectious and catches a ride in small droplets you breathe in.
110400	113440	Immediately, it begins to infect the cells that line your throat
113440	115280	and starts killing them to cause chaos.
116000	116500	Why?
117360	119600	To trick your body into giving it a lift.
120480	122800	Whenever cells in your body die a violent death,
122800	126720	your immune cells immediately stream to the site of infection to help out.
126720	129760	In this case, that backfires horribly.
129760	134720	As immune cells begin cleaning up dead cells, eating viruses and killing infected cells,
134720	137920	variola infects a crucial cell of your immune system,
137920	142160	your dendritic cells, intelligence cells that gather information
142160	143920	and leave the battlefield to get help.
144560	148880	They enter your lymphatic system, a highway network that spans your entire body
148880	150960	and connects hundreds of immune bases.
151600	154480	In these bases, your heavy defenses are activated
154480	157440	and should be the last place an enemy would want to invade,
157440	159440	but variola wants to get here.
160240	164560	For about 12 days, the virus quietly infects civilian and immune cells,
164560	167520	jumping from cell to cell, infecting more and more of them.
167920	173200	At some point, a critical threshold is reached and variola starts its attack for real.
173840	178240	Millions of viruses use the lymphatic highway to spill into your blood and organs,
178240	179680	infecting your whole body.
180560	183200	Suddenly, variola is everywhere.
184080	188560	But despite this global attack, your adaptive immune system is struggling to wake up.
188560	192640	Your immune cells look for and use critical transmitters called interferons
192640	194560	to mobilize the body against viruses.
195200	200880	Interferons, as the name suggests, interfere, significantly slowing down virus infections,
200880	203840	but also quickly activating millions of antivirus weapons.
204720	208080	But variola is able to deactivate interferons,
208080	210880	which stuns the antivirus side of your defense system.
211520	214640	Other systems would usually help, like the complement system,
214640	217760	a sort of mobile minefield that can destroy viruses.
217760	220240	But variola manages to shut this down too.
220880	224400	And so, with little resistance, variola spreads everywhere.
224560	227440	And infects billions of your cells all over your body.
228000	230080	Among the infected are your capillaries,
230080	233360	the smallest blood vessels in your body, which die in great numbers.
234000	237760	All this death activates an immune cell that you really don't need right now,
237760	240320	but that's attracted by death, the neutrophil.
240960	243680	Normally, an efficient killer of invaders great and small,
243680	246160	it's not very effective against smallpox.
246160	250160	And even worse, neutrophils fight by vomiting deadly chemicals,
250160	252000	which kills even more of your cells.
252960	255200	On top of that, they order inflammation,
255200	258320	fluids streaming from your blood vessels into your tissue.
258320	262240	All over your body, as first millions then billions of your cells die,
262240	264480	you get a rash that only gets worse and worse.
265280	269840	Pus and cellular junk fills it up as your body swells up with hundreds of lesions
269840	273360	all over your skin and inside, even on your organs,
273360	276240	all filled with billions of variola viruses.
277040	279280	Now, the critical phase begins.
279360	282480	As you fight for survival, you burn up in a high fever.
282480	284880	Thousands of battlegrounds drain your blood of fluid
284880	286800	that streams into your tissue and organs.
287360	289280	Blood clotting appears all over your body,
289280	293280	while floods of toxins from dead cells build up and can cause organs to fail.
293840	297120	Your lungs fill up with fluid, making it harder and harder to breathe.
297760	299440	One of two things happens now.
299440	302080	Either your immune system wrestles back control,
302080	304960	heavy weapons have been dispatched, killing infected cells,
304960	307520	cleaning up the thousands of infections one by one,
307520	311680	killing variola wherever it can be found, so you can slowly begin to recover.
311680	315840	The immune system will forever remember variola, making you immune forever.
315840	318560	Or you die, overwhelmed by the infection,
318560	321760	and your immune system's panicked reaction to the body-wide infection.
322480	325680	About a third of people who contract smallpox don't survive.
325680	328640	And if you survive, you're very likely branded by scars
328640	330800	and may even lose your eyesight or hearing.
331600	334800	For thousands of years, this terrible disease ravaged the world,
334880	338880	leaving death and destruction traumatized and maimed survivors.
338880	341040	Until one day, humanity said,
346000	349360	Smallpox is one of the worst diseases humanity has ever known.
349360	352560	A murderous, family-destroying, life-ruining monster.
353200	355280	There was nothing you could do for the infected,
355280	358160	but people noticed that if you survived, you were immune.
358960	363360	So out of desperation, they came up with the dangerous practice of variolation.
363920	367280	Take scabs from an infected person that had a mild case of smallpox,
367280	370240	let them dry out, and grind them to a fine powder.
370800	374880	Then blow the powder up the nostril of a patient or scratch their skin with it.
374880	378080	If things went well, they only got a mild version of smallpox
378080	379920	and gained immunity against the disease.
380480	384480	Variolation probably worked because it introduced variola in a part of the body
384480	387920	the virus wasn't prepared for, disabling most of its nasty tricks.
388480	390960	And because the inoculation was left to dry out,
390960	394480	that damaged the virus so it couldn't cause the full disease.
394480	397280	Unfortunately, two to three percent of all patients still died
397280	400800	because they got the smallpox or suffered other diseases as a result of treatment.
401520	405680	Still, smallpox was such a horrible and to some degree unavoidable disease
405680	408320	that people took the risk for themselves and their children.
409040	413360	Variolation spread around the globe, while variola continued to kill millions.
414000	417280	A victory over the virus only became a real possibility
417280	422160	when scientists realized that it wasn't necessary to variolate with the real smallpox disease,
422160	427520	but much safer to use material from cowpox, a variant that affected, surprise, cows.
428480	431760	A truly revolutionary step, and only a few years later,
431760	435600	this led to one of humankind's most outstanding achievements, vaccinations.
436160	437440	The innovation was simple.
438160	441200	Instead of using the real virus to train the immune system,
441200	445680	use a related virus, cowpox, that was only mild but also gave you immunity.
446480	451360	Still, it would take another 200 years, countless individuals fighting the monster where they could,
451360	454240	delivering vaccines to the most remote places on earth,
454240	459920	all the while the disease ravaged on, killing over 300 million people in the 20th century alone.
459920	462640	In 1966, the World Health Organization
462640	466080	decided that humanity had to come together in a final major effort.
466720	471760	A global smallpox news network based on residents in hotspots was created,
471760	473680	tackling local outbreaks of the virus.
474400	478240	Cases were encircled, vaccines given, preventing further spread.
479600	484160	Smallpox only infects humans, so if we stopped the human transmission chain,
484160	485520	we would starve the virus.
486160	489600	The last naturally occurring infection was in 1977,
489600	493680	and in 1980, just shy of 200 years since the first vaccine was used,
493680	496240	smallpox was declared eradicated.
496240	499440	Variola, the scourge of humanity, was dead.
500080	504880	No more children would be killed by it, no more mothers or brothers or uncles or cousins.
504880	508880	It's hard to convey to people around today what an incredible win this was.
508880	512480	One of the cruelest, most dangerous monsters that has hunted us
512480	517360	for literally millennia was slain by us, apes with pointy needles.
518640	521200	Today, we live in a time of enlightenment.
521200	524160	None of us alive today are haunted by the specter of smallpox.
524800	526560	This light is not natural.
527200	530080	It was set in the sky by the sheer will of humankind,
530080	532400	wanting to be safe from the monsters haunting us.
533840	538240	But because we live without them, we forget that they ever existed and that they are real.
540160	545120	That the diseases might reawaken, or new ones might be brewing in jungles,
545120	548880	wet markets or laboratories, ready to strike us once more.
549680	555120	We forget what an incredible gift vaccines are, and how hard we had to battle to get them.
555840	559840	We are still protected by the light, but it's cooling each and every day,
559840	564080	and we owe it to those who will come after us to make sure it doesn't go out.
564720	567520	We killed one monster. We can do it again.
