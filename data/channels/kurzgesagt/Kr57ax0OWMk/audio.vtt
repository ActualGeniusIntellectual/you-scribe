00:00.880 --> 00:05.600
Few of the monsters that evolution created have been so successful at hurting us

00:05.600 --> 00:08.640
as the variola virus, responsible for smallpox.

00:09.280 --> 00:12.560
The carnage it caused was so terrible and merciless

00:12.560 --> 00:16.640
that it compelled humankind, for the first time, to act truly globally.

00:17.280 --> 00:21.360
It was one of the greatest wins of our species over the ancient powers of nature,

00:21.360 --> 00:23.600
all made possible by cows.

00:30.960 --> 00:37.040
Variola is a virus, a tiny machine that only seeks to reproduce itself.

00:37.680 --> 00:40.080
Evidence of it has been found in Egyptian mummies

00:40.080 --> 00:43.120
and in writing for India and China as old as 3,000 years.

00:43.840 --> 00:48.240
1,300 years ago, smallpox killed up to a third of Japan's population.

00:48.800 --> 00:53.120
By the 1600s, it was one of the major causes of death worldwide.

00:53.120 --> 00:56.400
In late 18th century Europe, it killed 400,000 a year.

00:57.040 --> 01:00.240
Every third person who went blind did so because of this virus.

01:00.880 --> 01:04.160
Even in the 20th century, a hot second ago in history,

01:04.160 --> 01:06.400
it still killed at least 300 million people.

01:06.960 --> 01:11.680
Smallpox is an abusive monster that returns over and over and over again,

01:11.680 --> 01:14.880
killing, maiming and disrupting societies.

01:15.680 --> 01:18.960
How could variola be so incredibly deadly for so long

01:18.960 --> 01:21.520
and how could we have forgotten its horror so quickly?

01:22.240 --> 01:25.120
In 2023, there are only two laboratories left

01:25.120 --> 01:27.920
where the living virus is officially stored for research

01:27.920 --> 01:31.360
in Kosovo, Russia and Atlanta, USA.

01:31.360 --> 01:34.800
Which is certainly a good idea because what could possibly go wrong?

01:35.520 --> 01:38.480
Let's say that through an unfortunate series of events,

01:38.480 --> 01:41.120
the virus got out and you got infected.

01:41.120 --> 01:42.080
What would happen to you?

01:43.200 --> 01:44.640
How smallpox kills.

01:46.080 --> 01:50.400
Variola is highly infectious and catches a ride in small droplets you breathe in.

01:50.400 --> 01:53.440
Immediately, it begins to infect the cells that line your throat

01:53.440 --> 01:55.280
and starts killing them to cause chaos.

01:56.000 --> 01:56.500
Why?

01:57.360 --> 01:59.600
To trick your body into giving it a lift.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.800
Whenever cells in your body die a violent death,

02:02.800 --> 02:06.720
your immune cells immediately stream to the site of infection to help out.

02:06.720 --> 02:09.760
In this case, that backfires horribly.

02:09.760 --> 02:14.720
As immune cells begin cleaning up dead cells, eating viruses and killing infected cells,

02:14.720 --> 02:17.920
variola infects a crucial cell of your immune system,

02:17.920 --> 02:22.160
your dendritic cells, intelligence cells that gather information

02:22.160 --> 02:23.920
and leave the battlefield to get help.

02:24.560 --> 02:28.880
They enter your lymphatic system, a highway network that spans your entire body

02:28.880 --> 02:30.960
and connects hundreds of immune bases.

02:31.600 --> 02:34.480
In these bases, your heavy defenses are activated

02:34.480 --> 02:37.440
and should be the last place an enemy would want to invade,

02:37.440 --> 02:39.440
but variola wants to get here.

02:40.240 --> 02:44.560
For about 12 days, the virus quietly infects civilian and immune cells,

02:44.560 --> 02:47.520
jumping from cell to cell, infecting more and more of them.

02:47.920 --> 02:53.200
At some point, a critical threshold is reached and variola starts its attack for real.

02:53.840 --> 02:58.240
Millions of viruses use the lymphatic highway to spill into your blood and organs,

02:58.240 --> 02:59.680
infecting your whole body.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.200
Suddenly, variola is everywhere.

03:04.080 --> 03:08.560
But despite this global attack, your adaptive immune system is struggling to wake up.

03:08.560 --> 03:12.640
Your immune cells look for and use critical transmitters called interferons

03:12.640 --> 03:14.560
to mobilize the body against viruses.

03:15.200 --> 03:20.880
Interferons, as the name suggests, interfere, significantly slowing down virus infections,

03:20.880 --> 03:23.840
but also quickly activating millions of antivirus weapons.

03:24.720 --> 03:28.080
But variola is able to deactivate interferons,

03:28.080 --> 03:30.880
which stuns the antivirus side of your defense system.

03:31.520 --> 03:34.640
Other systems would usually help, like the complement system,

03:34.640 --> 03:37.760
a sort of mobile minefield that can destroy viruses.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.240
But variola manages to shut this down too.

03:40.880 --> 03:44.400
And so, with little resistance, variola spreads everywhere.

03:44.560 --> 03:47.440
And infects billions of your cells all over your body.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.080
Among the infected are your capillaries,

03:50.080 --> 03:53.360
the smallest blood vessels in your body, which die in great numbers.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.760
All this death activates an immune cell that you really don't need right now,

03:57.760 --> 04:00.320
but that's attracted by death, the neutrophil.

04:00.960 --> 04:03.680
Normally, an efficient killer of invaders great and small,

04:03.680 --> 04:06.160
it's not very effective against smallpox.

04:06.160 --> 04:10.160
And even worse, neutrophils fight by vomiting deadly chemicals,

04:10.160 --> 04:12.000
which kills even more of your cells.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.200
On top of that, they order inflammation,

04:15.200 --> 04:18.320
fluids streaming from your blood vessels into your tissue.

04:18.320 --> 04:22.240
All over your body, as first millions then billions of your cells die,

04:22.240 --> 04:24.480
you get a rash that only gets worse and worse.

04:25.280 --> 04:29.840
Pus and cellular junk fills it up as your body swells up with hundreds of lesions

04:29.840 --> 04:33.360
all over your skin and inside, even on your organs,

04:33.360 --> 04:36.240
all filled with billions of variola viruses.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.280
Now, the critical phase begins.

04:39.360 --> 04:42.480
As you fight for survival, you burn up in a high fever.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.880
Thousands of battlegrounds drain your blood of fluid

04:44.880 --> 04:46.800
that streams into your tissue and organs.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.280
Blood clotting appears all over your body,

04:49.280 --> 04:53.280
while floods of toxins from dead cells build up and can cause organs to fail.

04:53.840 --> 04:57.120
Your lungs fill up with fluid, making it harder and harder to breathe.

04:57.760 --> 04:59.440
One of two things happens now.

04:59.440 --> 05:02.080
Either your immune system wrestles back control,

05:02.080 --> 05:04.960
heavy weapons have been dispatched, killing infected cells,

05:04.960 --> 05:07.520
cleaning up the thousands of infections one by one,

05:07.520 --> 05:11.680
killing variola wherever it can be found, so you can slowly begin to recover.

05:11.680 --> 05:15.840
The immune system will forever remember variola, making you immune forever.

05:15.840 --> 05:18.560
Or you die, overwhelmed by the infection,

05:18.560 --> 05:21.760
and your immune system's panicked reaction to the body-wide infection.

05:22.480 --> 05:25.680
About a third of people who contract smallpox don't survive.

05:25.680 --> 05:28.640
And if you survive, you're very likely branded by scars

05:28.640 --> 05:30.800
and may even lose your eyesight or hearing.

05:31.600 --> 05:34.800
For thousands of years, this terrible disease ravaged the world,

05:34.880 --> 05:38.880
leaving death and destruction traumatized and maimed survivors.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.040
Until one day, humanity said,

05:46.000 --> 05:49.360
Smallpox is one of the worst diseases humanity has ever known.

05:49.360 --> 05:52.560
A murderous, family-destroying, life-ruining monster.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.280
There was nothing you could do for the infected,

05:55.280 --> 05:58.160
but people noticed that if you survived, you were immune.

05:58.960 --> 06:03.360
So out of desperation, they came up with the dangerous practice of variolation.

06:03.920 --> 06:07.280
Take scabs from an infected person that had a mild case of smallpox,

06:07.280 --> 06:10.240
let them dry out, and grind them to a fine powder.

06:10.800 --> 06:14.880
Then blow the powder up the nostril of a patient or scratch their skin with it.

06:14.880 --> 06:18.080
If things went well, they only got a mild version of smallpox

06:18.080 --> 06:19.920
and gained immunity against the disease.

06:20.480 --> 06:24.480
Variolation probably worked because it introduced variola in a part of the body

06:24.480 --> 06:27.920
the virus wasn't prepared for, disabling most of its nasty tricks.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.960
And because the inoculation was left to dry out,

06:30.960 --> 06:34.480
that damaged the virus so it couldn't cause the full disease.

06:34.480 --> 06:37.280
Unfortunately, two to three percent of all patients still died

06:37.280 --> 06:40.800
because they got the smallpox or suffered other diseases as a result of treatment.

06:41.520 --> 06:45.680
Still, smallpox was such a horrible and to some degree unavoidable disease

06:45.680 --> 06:48.320
that people took the risk for themselves and their children.

06:49.040 --> 06:53.360
Variolation spread around the globe, while variola continued to kill millions.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.280
A victory over the virus only became a real possibility

06:57.280 --> 07:02.160
when scientists realized that it wasn't necessary to variolate with the real smallpox disease,

07:02.160 --> 07:07.520
but much safer to use material from cowpox, a variant that affected, surprise, cows.

07:08.480 --> 07:11.760
A truly revolutionary step, and only a few years later,

07:11.760 --> 07:15.600
this led to one of humankind's most outstanding achievements, vaccinations.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.440
The innovation was simple.

07:18.160 --> 07:21.200
Instead of using the real virus to train the immune system,

07:21.200 --> 07:25.680
use a related virus, cowpox, that was only mild but also gave you immunity.

07:26.480 --> 07:31.360
Still, it would take another 200 years, countless individuals fighting the monster where they could,

07:31.360 --> 07:34.240
delivering vaccines to the most remote places on earth,

07:34.240 --> 07:39.920
all the while the disease ravaged on, killing over 300 million people in the 20th century alone.

07:39.920 --> 07:42.640
In 1966, the World Health Organization

07:42.640 --> 07:46.080
decided that humanity had to come together in a final major effort.

07:46.720 --> 07:51.760
A global smallpox news network based on residents in hotspots was created,

07:51.760 --> 07:53.680
tackling local outbreaks of the virus.

07:54.400 --> 07:58.240
Cases were encircled, vaccines given, preventing further spread.

07:59.600 --> 08:04.160
Smallpox only infects humans, so if we stopped the human transmission chain,

08:04.160 --> 08:05.520
we would starve the virus.

08:06.160 --> 08:09.600
The last naturally occurring infection was in 1977,

08:09.600 --> 08:13.680
and in 1980, just shy of 200 years since the first vaccine was used,

08:13.680 --> 08:16.240
smallpox was declared eradicated.

08:16.240 --> 08:19.440
Variola, the scourge of humanity, was dead.

08:20.080 --> 08:24.880
No more children would be killed by it, no more mothers or brothers or uncles or cousins.

08:24.880 --> 08:28.880
It's hard to convey to people around today what an incredible win this was.

08:28.880 --> 08:32.480
One of the cruelest, most dangerous monsters that has hunted us

08:32.480 --> 08:37.360
for literally millennia was slain by us, apes with pointy needles.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.200
Today, we live in a time of enlightenment.

08:41.200 --> 08:44.160
None of us alive today are haunted by the specter of smallpox.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.560
This light is not natural.

08:47.200 --> 08:50.080
It was set in the sky by the sheer will of humankind,

08:50.080 --> 08:52.400
wanting to be safe from the monsters haunting us.

08:53.840 --> 08:58.240
But because we live without them, we forget that they ever existed and that they are real.

09:00.160 --> 09:05.120
That the diseases might reawaken, or new ones might be brewing in jungles,

09:05.120 --> 09:08.880
wet markets or laboratories, ready to strike us once more.

09:09.680 --> 09:15.120
We forget what an incredible gift vaccines are, and how hard we had to battle to get them.

09:15.840 --> 09:19.840
We are still protected by the light, but it's cooling each and every day,

09:19.840 --> 09:24.080
and we owe it to those who will come after us to make sure it doesn't go out.

09:24.720 --> 09:27.520
We killed one monster. We can do it again.

09:29.280 --> 09:31.600
This video was supported by Open Philanthropy.

09:32.400 --> 09:35.920
Do you want to continue learning about the fascinating world of biology?

09:35.920 --> 09:37.120
We've got you.

09:37.120 --> 09:39.520
Let's take a real close look at the human body.

09:39.520 --> 09:42.160
This is an arm, and this is a human cell.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.720
The microscopic stage where everything happens.

09:44.800 --> 09:49.840
Where all the important battles are fought and where you are constantly built over and over again.

09:50.480 --> 09:54.080
Even though it's the smallest unit of life, the cell is extremely complex.

09:54.080 --> 09:57.920
But don't worry, we managed to fit everything you need to know on a single poster.

09:57.920 --> 10:03.440
And in true Kurzgesagt fashion, it's easy to understand and even easier on the eyes.

10:04.320 --> 10:09.360
Grasping a complex topic is much easier when it's presented in exciting ways.

10:09.360 --> 10:14.000
The poster was researched and designed in collaboration with molecular biologist James Gurney,

10:14.000 --> 10:19.040
so it's expert approved and contains all the latest cutting edge science about organelles,

10:19.040 --> 10:22.080
their function, and their place in the cellular world.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.280
We love bringing science into your home with our videos,

10:25.280 --> 10:27.840
and we're so excited whenever we get to do it literally.

10:28.400 --> 10:31.760
That's why we take hundreds of hours to create our science posters,

10:31.760 --> 10:35.920
all researched with care and crafted with love by us here at Kurzgesagt.

10:35.920 --> 10:39.680
