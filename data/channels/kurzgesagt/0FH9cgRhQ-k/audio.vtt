00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
The largest things in the universe are black holes. In contrast to things like

00:05.440 --> 00:10.040
planets or stars, they have no physical size limit and can literally grow

00:10.040 --> 00:14.040
endlessly. Although in reality, specific things need to happen to create

00:14.040 --> 00:18.560
different kinds of black holes, from really tiny ones to the largest single

00:18.560 --> 00:25.040
things in the universe. So how do black holes grow? And how large is the largest

00:25.040 --> 00:27.480
of them all?

00:30.000 --> 00:38.840
This video will not discuss how black holes work or how they form, since we've

00:38.840 --> 00:42.880
looked at that in detail in our black hole and neutron star series. You can

00:42.880 --> 00:47.040
check them out afterwards. For now, we're interested in finding the largest thing

00:47.040 --> 00:54.200
in the universe. Let's start really, really small. Primordial black holes. The

00:54.200 --> 00:59.080
smallest kind of black holes may or may not exist. If they do, they're probably

00:59.120 --> 01:04.240
the oldest objects in the universe, older even than atoms. They would have formed

01:04.240 --> 01:08.520
just after the Big Bang, when the universe was so dense with violent energy

01:08.520 --> 01:12.120
that any tiny pocket that was just slightly more dense than its neighbors

01:12.120 --> 01:16.880
could produce a black hole. The smallest primordial black hole that could still

01:16.880 --> 01:22.240
be around would be a trillion kilograms or so, the mass of a big mountain. And yet

01:22.240 --> 01:26.960
they would be no bigger than a proton. A primordial black hole with the mass of

01:26.960 --> 01:31.240
Earth would barely be larger than a coin. This makes them very hard to find,

01:31.240 --> 01:36.520
so we haven't actually observed any yet. If they exist, they may even be the

01:36.520 --> 01:41.680
mysterious dark matter that holds galaxies together. Let's move on to the

01:41.680 --> 01:48.120
kinds of black holes that we know for sure are out there. Stellar black holes.

01:48.120 --> 01:52.960
To make a black hole, we need to compress enough matter so that it collapses into

01:53.080 --> 01:58.800
itself. After that, the more mass we throw at it, the larger it becomes. In today's

01:58.800 --> 02:02.620
universe, only the most violent cosmic events can create the necessary

02:02.620 --> 02:06.720
conditions, such as the merger of neutron stars or when the core of a very massive

02:06.720 --> 02:11.680
star collapses in a supernova. To have a unit to work with here, we'll use the

02:11.680 --> 02:17.800
mass of our Sun, about 2 million trillion trillion kilograms. The smallest known

02:17.800 --> 02:22.320
black hole has 2.7 times the mass of the Sun, which works out as a sphere

02:22.320 --> 02:27.480
around 16 kilometers in diameter, large enough to cover Paris. Another

02:27.480 --> 02:33.760
lightweight black hole is the companion to the V723 Mon red giant star. This star

02:33.760 --> 02:39.080
is 24 times larger than our Sun, 30 million kilometers in diameter, and yet

02:39.080 --> 02:45.320
it's thrown around by a tiny black hole just 17.2 kilometers wide. This tiny

02:45.320 --> 02:49.600
thing bullying the star is so much smaller that we can barely even show

02:49.600 --> 02:56.160
them in comparison. One of the largest known stellar black holes is M33 X7. It

02:56.160 --> 03:02.040
currently spends its time eating a 70 solar mass blue giant bit by bit. As all

03:02.040 --> 03:06.080
that stolen matter circles towards the black hole, like water going down a drain,

03:06.080 --> 03:10.480
friction heats it up to temperatures high enough to shine 500,000 times

03:10.480 --> 03:18.160
brighter than our Sun. And yet, X7 is only 15.65 solar masses and 92

03:18.160 --> 03:24.160
kilometers wide, just big enough to cast a shadow on Corsica. To grow much larger,

03:24.160 --> 03:28.640
black holes have to either devour a lot of stars, or better, merge with one

03:28.640 --> 03:32.920
another. The instruments that make it possible to detect these mergers are

03:32.920 --> 03:37.940
very new, so we're currently discovering a lot of exciting things, like two

03:37.940 --> 03:42.600
massive black holes that we detected in a galaxy 17 billion light-years away. As

03:42.600 --> 03:47.160
they spun around each other violently, they released more energy in the form of

03:47.160 --> 03:51.120
gravitational waves than the combined light from all the stars in the Milky

03:51.120 --> 03:57.640
Way in 4,400 years. The new black hole they formed is about the size of Germany

03:57.640 --> 04:05.720
and is 142 solar masses. And here, we hit a curious gap in scale. There are lots of

04:05.720 --> 04:11.080
black holes up to 150 solar masses, and then there's nothing for a long time,

04:11.080 --> 04:16.840
until we suddenly hit black holes that are millions of times more massive, which

04:16.840 --> 04:21.160
is a bit confusing, because we had this idea that black holes are consistently

04:21.160 --> 04:26.040
growing and growing. But for the most massive black holes, this process is not

04:26.040 --> 04:30.600
fast enough to explain their existence today. The universe is simply not old

04:30.600 --> 04:34.240
enough for these supermassive black holes to have formed by eating stars and

04:34.240 --> 04:38.960
merging with each other. Something else must have happened. To explain how we got

04:38.960 --> 04:43.160
the largest black holes in the universe, we might need the largest stars that

04:43.160 --> 04:48.520
ever existed, quasi-stars. To get a sense of scale, we can compare them to the

04:48.520 --> 04:54.920
largest stars that exist today. Our Sun is like a grain of sand next to them. We

04:54.920 --> 04:58.880
don't know if quasi-stars actually existed, but they're an interesting

04:58.880 --> 05:03.440
concept when it comes to supercharging black hole development. The idea is that

05:03.440 --> 05:07.640
the matter in the early universe was so dense that quasi-stars could grow to

05:07.640 --> 05:12.300
thousands of times the mass of our Sun. The cause of these stars might have been

05:12.300 --> 05:16.780
crushed by their own weight so much to actually collapse into black holes while

05:16.780 --> 05:21.100
the star was still forming. In contrast to stars today that would destroy

05:21.100 --> 05:25.220
themselves in the process, inside quasi-stars a deadly balance could

05:25.220 --> 05:29.900
emerge. Gravity pressed the supermassive star together, feeding the black hole and

05:29.900 --> 05:33.980
heating the material falling in to such a degree that the radiation pressure kept

05:33.980 --> 05:38.380
the star stable. And so these quickly growing black holes might have been able

05:38.460 --> 05:42.780
to consume the quasi-star for millions of years and grow far bigger than any

05:42.780 --> 05:47.740
modern stellar black hole. Black holes several thousand times the mass of the

05:47.740 --> 05:52.900
Sun and wider than the entire Earth. These black holes might have become the

05:52.900 --> 05:59.180
seeds for supermassive black holes. So now we arrive at the kings of our

05:59.180 --> 06:04.900
universe, the largest single bodies in existence. The centers of most galaxies

06:04.900 --> 06:10.540
contain a supermassive black hole and they are monstrous. In the Milky Way we

06:10.540 --> 06:15.500
have Sagittarius A*, a supermassive black hole with about 4 million solar

06:15.500 --> 06:20.500
masses that is calm and collected and just does its thing. We know it sits

06:20.500 --> 06:24.260
there because we can see a number of stars being thrown around by a seemingly

06:24.260 --> 06:30.700
empty spot. And despite its incredible mass its radius is still only 17 times

06:30.780 --> 06:37.140
our Sun. Smaller than most giant stars but millions of times more massive.

06:37.140 --> 06:41.940
Because supermassive black holes are so massive and located at the center of

06:41.940 --> 06:45.500
galaxies many people imagine them as being a bit like the Sun in the solar

06:45.500 --> 06:50.020
system. An anchor that glues everything else together and forces it into an

06:50.020 --> 06:56.820
orbit. But this is a misconception. While the Sun makes up 99.86% of all the mass

06:56.820 --> 07:03.460
in the solar system supermassive black holes usually only have 0.001% of the

07:03.460 --> 07:08.620
mass of their galaxy. The billions of stars in galaxies are not gravitationally

07:08.620 --> 07:12.420
bound to them instead it's the gravitational effect of dark matter

07:12.420 --> 07:17.300
which holds them together. Many supermassive black holes aren't gentle

07:17.300 --> 07:21.180
giants especially when they're feeding on the clouds of mass in their galaxy.

07:21.180 --> 07:26.180
The one at the center of the BL Lacerte galaxy is devouring so much material

07:26.180 --> 07:29.900
that it produces jets of plasma accelerated to nearly the speed of light.

07:29.900 --> 07:36.380
If Earth were orbiting this huge body it would seem 115 times larger than our Sun

07:36.380 --> 07:40.960
in the sky and we'd be burnt to a crisp in seconds by its glowing hot accretion

07:40.960 --> 07:46.820
disk. At this point black holes become so large that stars seem ridiculously tiny

07:46.820 --> 07:52.900
compared to them. The galaxy Cygnus A has a supermassive black hole with 2.5

07:52.940 --> 07:58.420
billion solar masses and 14.7 billion kilometers wide which would mean that if

07:58.420 --> 08:02.100
it took the place of our Sun it would swallow all the planets and stretch

08:02.100 --> 08:07.940
halfway to the edge of our solar system. It's devouring so much mass and material

08:07.940 --> 08:13.040
that it turns its disk into a kind of magnetic funnel spewing gas out making

08:13.040 --> 08:17.700
tremendous radio lobes towering over the galaxy half a million light-years in

08:17.700 --> 08:23.820
diameter. That's two and a half Milky ways wide. Another pretty large

08:23.820 --> 08:29.860
supermassive black hole sits in the galaxy Messier 87. It has 6.5 billion

08:29.860 --> 08:34.740
solar masses and was the first black hole we got an actual photo of or rather

08:34.740 --> 08:41.140
of the glowing gas around the edge of a menacing shadow. This sphere of darkness

08:41.140 --> 08:47.220
is so large that it covers our entire solar system and yet there is a scale

08:47.220 --> 08:54.140
even above these kinds of objects. Ultramassive black holes.

08:54.700 --> 08:59.980
Now we reach the most massive black holes perhaps the largest single bodies

08:59.980 --> 09:04.780
that will ever exist. These black holes have eaten so much that they've grown to

09:04.780 --> 09:09.500
tens of billions of solar masses their gravity the engine for a quasar an

09:09.500 --> 09:14.340
accretion disk shining brighter than thousands of galaxies full of stars. So

09:14.340 --> 09:19.940
massive that they deserve a title of their own. Ultramassive black holes. The

09:19.940 --> 09:25.900
ultramassive black hole at the center of galaxy oj 287 is 18 billion solar

09:25.900 --> 09:31.140
masses. It's so big that it has a supermassive black hole nearly 40 times

09:31.140 --> 09:36.940
larger than Sagittarius a star orbiting it. This thing defies imagination and is

09:36.940 --> 09:41.780
really hard to compare to anything. It can comfortably fit three solar systems

09:41.780 --> 09:47.780
side-by-side inside of it. Let's end this insane competition and get to the

09:47.780 --> 09:53.620
king of kings. Ton 618 a black hole that we can observe consuming galaxies worth

09:53.620 --> 09:58.580
of matter is shining with the brightness of a hundred trillion stars visible from

09:58.580 --> 10:04.860
18 billion light-years away. It has an incredible 66 billion solar masses. A

10:04.860 --> 10:09.180
black hole so large that it would take light a week to reach the singularity

10:09.420 --> 10:14.380
after crossing the event horizon. About 11 solar systems could sit inside of it

10:14.380 --> 10:20.100
side-by-side. It may very well be the largest single body in the universe but

10:20.100 --> 10:26.520
in reality it's probably even larger. Since ton 618 is so far away we only see

10:26.520 --> 10:32.500
what it looked like 10 billion years ago. In any case black holes are scary and

10:32.500 --> 10:38.940
mysterious and gigantic. They'll be here after everything else dies and growing

10:38.940 --> 10:45.660
larger and larger. Okay now let's do the trip again. From the smallest possible

10:45.660 --> 10:50.060
black hole all the way up to the largest.

11:08.940 --> 11:30.380
Let's try something new today. We can call it behind the lies. A short

11:30.380 --> 11:34.060
behind-the-scenes bit about the necessary inaccuracies in this video

11:34.060 --> 11:38.020
because it's not really actually possible to rank black holes like

11:38.100 --> 11:43.900
trading cards. How so? Well while we've catalogued millions of stars we really

11:43.900 --> 11:48.420
only have good data on a couple of dozen black holes. That's because black hole

11:48.420 --> 11:52.420
gazing wasn't really a thing until 50 years ago and technically still isn't

11:52.420 --> 11:56.260
because we can't see black holes. We can only derive their properties from

11:56.260 --> 11:59.780
studying their gravitational effects on the matter around them like the orbit of

11:59.780 --> 12:03.940
stars that come close to them. This effect depends on the mass of the black

12:03.940 --> 12:08.500
hole which we can approximate at the most basic level with Kepler's laws. But

12:08.500 --> 12:13.460
this comes with huge uncertainties and error bars. Then we have to convert mass

12:13.460 --> 12:18.020
to size next which brings new uncertainties. For example we calculated

12:18.020 --> 12:21.220
the radius from the mass using the Schwarzschild equation which for the

12:21.220 --> 12:25.900
sake of simplicity assumes black holes are perfectly round and don't spin. A

12:25.900 --> 12:30.500
kind of black hole that doesn't really exist. The reality is that physics on

12:30.580 --> 12:35.620
these scales is a bit fuzzy. So some of the black holes we talked about here may

12:35.620 --> 12:40.180
be way smaller or way bigger. We just don't know for sure. We shimmed around

12:40.180 --> 12:44.100
this problem by comparing different sources with different kinds of values

12:44.100 --> 12:48.460
and using different mass calculations to arrive at a standardized list that

12:48.460 --> 12:52.420
allowed us to be as accurate as humanly possible. You can look at all of this in

12:52.420 --> 12:57.060
our source doc. As a result this script was written with the tears of experts we

12:57.060 --> 13:02.060
drove crazy with our obsession for the best values they could live with. In this

13:02.060 --> 13:06.860
process tons of stuff got cut and didn't make it into the final video. But luckily

13:06.860 --> 13:12.060
we found a way to not waste all of it. We've created a lot of black hole merch

13:12.060 --> 13:16.980
spanning the whole range from somewhat bonkers to more serious. This way we get

13:16.980 --> 13:21.020
to explore a topic from different angles and you get to continue having fun with

13:21.020 --> 13:23.540
black holes after this video ends.
