0	2000	What's the smallest possible black hole?
2000	6200	Well, anything can be turned into a black hole if you squeeze hard enough, even dark.
6200	10900	All matter has some gravity, and that gravity depends on the mass of the object and how far away it is.
10900	12200	The further, the weaker.
12200	16700	For example, when you feel Earth's gravity, you're already feeling the gravity of all the planet's atoms.
16700	20800	The ones close to you under your feet, and the ones far away on the other side of the planet.
20800	24600	But if you squeezed Earth, making it smaller, all those atoms would be closer together,
24600	28500	meaning they're closer to you, so you'd feel stronger gravity on Earth's surface.
28600	32200	So the trick to making a black hole is getting a lot of mass close enough together.
32200	35400	When duck is regular-sized, you don't notice its gravity.
35400	41100	But if you squeeze it to the size of one micron, a bacteria standing on it experiences gravity comparable to Earth's.
41100	45100	Keep squeezing until duck is a trillion times smaller than a proton.
45100	49800	Its gravity will become so strong, not even light can escape, collapsing duck into a black hole.
49800	54000	So black holes can be any size, but good luck squeezing hard enough to make one.
