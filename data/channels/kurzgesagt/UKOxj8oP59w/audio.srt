00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What's the smallest possible black hole?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,200
Well, anything can be turned into a black hole if you squeeze hard enough, even dark.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,900
All matter has some gravity, and that gravity depends on the mass of the object and how far away it is.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,200
The further, the weaker.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,700
For example, when you feel Earth's gravity, you're already feeling the gravity of all the planet's atoms.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,800
The ones close to you under your feet, and the ones far away on the other side of the planet.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,600
But if you squeezed Earth, making it smaller, all those atoms would be closer together,

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,500
meaning they're closer to you, so you'd feel stronger gravity on Earth's surface.

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,200
So the trick to making a black hole is getting a lot of mass close enough together.

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,400
When duck is regular-sized, you don't notice its gravity.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:41,100
But if you squeeze it to the size of one micron, a bacteria standing on it experiences gravity comparable to Earth's.

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,100
Keep squeezing until duck is a trillion times smaller than a proton.

13
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,800
Its gravity will become so strong, not even light can escape, collapsing duck into a black hole.

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,000
So black holes can be any size, but good luck squeezing hard enough to make one.
