00:00.000 --> 00:06.720
The universe looks like a vast, empty ocean sprinkled with rare islands of galaxies.

00:06.720 --> 00:09.240
But this is an illusion.

00:09.240 --> 00:12.440
Just a small fraction of all atoms are found in galaxies,

00:12.440 --> 00:17.520
while the rest is thought to be drifting in between, in the intergalactic medium.

00:17.520 --> 00:19.840
Like the roots of some massive tree,

00:19.840 --> 00:26.720
gas spreads out from each galaxy, gravity funneling fresh mass into this dense cosmic forest.

00:26.960 --> 00:31.360
Here in the intergalactic medium are the raw materials of creation.

00:31.360 --> 00:36.640
Hydrogen and helium, woven into sheets and filaments that flow into galaxies,

00:36.640 --> 00:39.600
where they eventually create stars.

00:39.600 --> 00:43.440
But if we look closely, we see who's actually in charge.

00:43.440 --> 00:48.080
Quasars, the single most powerful objects in existence.

00:48.080 --> 00:51.280
As small as a grain of sand compared to the Amazon River,

00:51.280 --> 00:56.320
they reside in the centers of some galaxies, shining with the power of a trillion stars,

00:56.320 --> 01:01.600
blasting out huge jets of matter, completely reshaping the cosmos around them.

01:01.600 --> 01:05.280
They're so powerful that they can kill a galaxy.

01:05.280 --> 01:10.160
What are they, and how do they mold the structure of the universe at their whim?

01:18.320 --> 01:22.560
Everywhere you look, weird things in the sky.

01:22.560 --> 01:29.200
In the 1950s, astronomers noticed mysterious loud radio waves coming from spots all over the sky.

01:29.200 --> 01:35.760
They were named quasi-stellar radio sources, or quasars, because they were dots like stars,

01:35.760 --> 01:39.840
but were seen in radio waves rather than visible light.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.400
Everything about them was strange.

01:42.400 --> 01:47.520
Some flickered, others emitted high-energy X-rays in addition to radio waves,

01:47.520 --> 01:49.920
but all seemed to be tiny.

01:49.920 --> 01:55.040
They all moved extremely fast, as much as over 30% the speed of light.

01:55.040 --> 01:58.320
The only explanation was that they must have been so distant

01:58.320 --> 02:03.200
that their apparent speed was actually the expansion of the universe, moving them away from us.

02:03.200 --> 02:08.000
But these enormous distances meant that quasars couldn't just be stars,

02:08.000 --> 02:12.560
but the active cores of galaxies billions of light-years away.

02:12.560 --> 02:14.320
And it gets crazier.

02:14.320 --> 02:18.560
To appear so bright and loud, given these vast distances,

02:18.560 --> 02:22.720
they are thousands of times brighter than the entire Milky Way.

02:22.720 --> 02:29.600
Monsters exploding and screaming into the void with a violence not thought possible before.

02:29.600 --> 02:33.680
As we mapped the sky, we discovered over a million quasars.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.320
And they all seemed to be very far away.

02:36.320 --> 02:43.120
Looking into space far away means very long ago, because light takes so long to reach us.

02:43.120 --> 02:47.440
Quasars were common in the early universe, having peaked in number 10 billion years ago

02:47.440 --> 02:52.000
when galaxies, and the universe itself, were still very young.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.920
Let's go back in time, just 3 billion years after the Big Bang,

02:55.920 --> 02:57.600
and see what was going on back then.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.960
The incredible power of quasars.

03:02.480 --> 03:07.360
How could an early baby galaxy be so incredibly bright and violent?

03:07.360 --> 03:11.520
All that light and radiation couldn't be stars, as there weren't nearly enough of them.

03:12.240 --> 03:15.760
And since galaxies tend to grow with time by merging,

03:15.760 --> 03:20.560
the starlight from small galaxies shouldn't be far brighter than any galaxy today.

03:21.200 --> 03:25.280
There's only one way to generate the vast amounts of energy a quasar shines with.

03:25.920 --> 03:27.920
Feeding supermassive black holes.

03:28.480 --> 03:30.880
We still don't know how exactly they formed,

03:30.880 --> 03:33.760
but it seems that every galaxy has one in their center.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.680
But how can the brightest things in the universe be black holes,

03:37.680 --> 03:40.960
which trap anything and everything that crosses their event horizon?

03:41.520 --> 03:45.840
Well, the light of a quasar is not coming from inside these black holes.

03:45.840 --> 03:48.400
Rather, it comes from the space around them,

03:48.400 --> 03:51.920
a massive orbiting disk of gas called an accretion disk.

03:52.800 --> 03:56.080
Quasars use the same fuel as stars to shine.

03:56.080 --> 03:56.480
Matter.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.760
It's just that black holes are the most efficient engines

03:59.760 --> 04:02.080
for converting matter into energy in the universe.

04:02.880 --> 04:05.600
The energy released by matter falling into a black hole

04:05.600 --> 04:10.080
can be 60 times greater than that released by nuclear fusion in the core of a star,

04:10.080 --> 04:15.120
because the energy released by a black hole comes from gravity, not from nuclear reactions.

04:15.920 --> 04:19.360
Matter falling into a black hole speeds up to almost the speed of light

04:19.360 --> 04:23.680
before it crosses the event horizon, buzzing with an incredible amount of kinetic energy.

04:24.560 --> 04:28.640
Of course, once inside the black hole, it takes that energy with it.

04:29.520 --> 04:34.400
You only get to witness this energy if you drop your matter in the right way.

04:34.400 --> 04:37.920
Fall straight down and the outside universe gets nothing.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.520
But when you have a lot of matter,

04:39.520 --> 04:44.000
it spirals in incredibly fast towards the event horizon, forming a disk.

04:44.720 --> 04:49.200
Collisions between particles and friction heated up to hundreds of thousands of degrees.

04:50.080 --> 04:52.640
In a space not much bigger than our solar system,

04:52.640 --> 04:57.200
the core of a galaxy can release many times more energy than all its stars combined.

04:58.160 --> 05:00.000
This is what a quasar is.

05:00.720 --> 05:03.600
A supermassive black hole having a feast.

05:04.240 --> 05:06.800
And these black holes eat a lot.

05:06.800 --> 05:10.720
Typical quasars consume one to a hundred earth masses of gas per minute.

05:11.600 --> 05:15.520
Ten billion years ago, the universe was about a third of its current size.

05:15.520 --> 05:18.560
So the intergalactic medium was much less spread out,

05:18.560 --> 05:22.480
meaning the filaments of gas around quasars could feed them a banquet,

05:22.480 --> 05:25.440
making them vomit insane amounts of light and radiation.

05:26.240 --> 05:28.720
The brightest quasars power jets,

05:28.720 --> 05:32.160
tangling the magnetic field of the matter around them into a narrow cone.

05:32.960 --> 05:36.960
Like a particle accelerator, they launch enormous beams of matter out,

05:36.960 --> 05:39.120
plowing through the circumgalactic medium,

05:39.120 --> 05:43.120
forming plumes of matter that grow to hundreds of thousands of light years in size.

05:43.680 --> 05:46.080
It's almost unfathomable in scale.

05:46.640 --> 05:50.640
A tiny spot in a galaxy carving out patches of the universe

05:50.640 --> 05:52.640
hundreds of thousands of light years long.

05:53.360 --> 05:56.720
But quasars can't eat for long, maybe a few million years,

05:56.720 --> 05:59.520
because their feast ultimately kills their galaxy.

05:59.520 --> 06:02.640
How quasars kill galaxies.

06:03.600 --> 06:06.640
Okay, maybe killing is a bit of an exaggeration.

06:06.640 --> 06:09.920
A galaxy is still there after its quasar turns off,

06:09.920 --> 06:11.440
but it will never be the same again.

06:12.160 --> 06:15.680
Quasars, being among the hottest and brightest things in the universe,

06:15.680 --> 06:19.840
break their galaxies by heating them up too much and stopping star formation.

06:20.400 --> 06:23.680
Stars are gas that collapsed in on itself and then got really hot.

06:24.240 --> 06:28.080
But in a cloud of gas that's already hot, atoms are moving quickly.

06:28.080 --> 06:32.800
When they collide, they hit hard, exerting pressure that resists gravity's squeeze.

06:33.520 --> 06:36.080
So hot gas cannot form stars.

06:36.960 --> 06:40.880
Instead, the best gas for forming stars is already cold

06:40.880 --> 06:43.680
and won't put up a fight when it's time to collapse into a star.

06:44.560 --> 06:47.840
On top of that, quasars push gas out of their galaxies.

06:48.400 --> 06:53.440
Not only does this starve the quasar, but its galaxy loses the raw materials for new stars.

06:54.240 --> 06:57.360
As sad as this sounds, it might be a good thing for life.

06:58.080 --> 07:01.600
The alternative can be far more dangerous. Too many stars.

07:02.400 --> 07:07.440
New stars forming is usually followed by massive stars exploding in supernovae,

07:07.440 --> 07:09.360
so planets would be burned sterile.

07:10.240 --> 07:12.160
But of course, it's more complicated.

07:13.120 --> 07:15.840
Like the intricacies of our own planet's biosphere,

07:15.840 --> 07:18.080
every piece of the galaxy is depended on

07:18.080 --> 07:21.280
and influencing every other part of the galactic environment.

07:21.840 --> 07:26.400
While hot things like quasars and supernovae tend to push gas out of the galaxy,

07:26.400 --> 07:31.680
shockwaves and quasar jets can also compress gas, making new stars at least for a short time.

07:32.240 --> 07:35.760
But in general, we can say that without things becoming a bit more chill,

07:35.760 --> 07:37.520
we would not exist today.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.520
Which brings us to our final question.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.480
Did the Milky Way have a quasar in the past?

07:43.200 --> 07:46.400
It's unclear if every galaxy went through a quasar phase,

07:46.400 --> 07:50.560
but understanding distant quasars may provide clues to the history of the Milky Way.

07:51.280 --> 07:54.400
Galaxies don't do a good job of preserving their history.

07:54.400 --> 07:58.880
Like sand on a beach, the endless churning mixes away the clues to their past.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.560
It's possible the Milky Way was once a quasar,

08:02.560 --> 08:06.320
which may have allowed our supermassive black hole Sagittarius A star

08:06.320 --> 08:08.960
to have grown to four million times the mass of the Sun.

08:09.600 --> 08:14.880
And as dormant as it is now, Sagittarius A star could turn into a quasar in the future.

08:15.520 --> 08:19.040
In a few billion years, the Milky Way will merge with Andromeda.

08:19.600 --> 08:23.600
We've seen over a hundred double quasars in galaxies smashing together,

08:23.600 --> 08:26.400
where fresh gas is provided for the central black holes.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.320
But it won't last for long.

08:28.880 --> 08:32.400
When galaxies merge, so do their supermassive black holes,

08:32.400 --> 08:37.200
sinking into the center of their new galaxy, kicking up dust and stars in every direction.

08:37.840 --> 08:42.880
We don't know whether this will happen, but it would truly be an incredible sight.

08:42.880 --> 08:48.960
Maybe some beings in the far future are going to witness it, and be in awe of what they see.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.640
But you don't have to wait that long.

08:52.640 --> 08:55.840
There are already plenty of fascinating things to explore,

08:55.840 --> 09:00.560
