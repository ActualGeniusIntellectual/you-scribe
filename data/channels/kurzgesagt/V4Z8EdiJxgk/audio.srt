1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
The universe looks like a vast, empty ocean sprinkled with rare islands of galaxies.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,240
But this is an illusion.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,440
Just a small fraction of all atoms are found in galaxies,

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,520
while the rest is thought to be drifting in between, in the intergalactic medium.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,840
Like the roots of some massive tree,

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,720
gas spreads out from each galaxy, gravity funneling fresh mass into this dense cosmic forest.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,360
Here in the intergalactic medium are the raw materials of creation.

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,640
Hydrogen and helium, woven into sheets and filaments that flow into galaxies,

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,600
where they eventually create stars.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,440
But if we look closely, we see who's actually in charge.

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,080
Quasars, the single most powerful objects in existence.

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,280
As small as a grain of sand compared to the Amazon River,

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,320
they reside in the centers of some galaxies, shining with the power of a trillion stars,

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,600
blasting out huge jets of matter, completely reshaping the cosmos around them.

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,280
They're so powerful that they can kill a galaxy.

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,160
What are they, and how do they mold the structure of the universe at their whim?

17
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,560
Everywhere you look, weird things in the sky.

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,200
In the 1950s, astronomers noticed mysterious loud radio waves coming from spots all over the sky.

19
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,760
They were named quasi-stellar radio sources, or quasars, because they were dots like stars,

20
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,840
but were seen in radio waves rather than visible light.

21
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,400
Everything about them was strange.

22
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,520
Some flickered, others emitted high-energy X-rays in addition to radio waves,

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,920
but all seemed to be tiny.

24
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,040
They all moved extremely fast, as much as over 30% the speed of light.

25
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,320
The only explanation was that they must have been so distant

26
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,200
that their apparent speed was actually the expansion of the universe, moving them away from us.

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,000
But these enormous distances meant that quasars couldn't just be stars,

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,560
but the active cores of galaxies billions of light-years away.

29
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,320
And it gets crazier.

30
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,560
To appear so bright and loud, given these vast distances,

31
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,720
they are thousands of times brighter than the entire Milky Way.

32
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,600
Monsters exploding and screaming into the void with a violence not thought possible before.

33
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,680
As we mapped the sky, we discovered over a million quasars.

34
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,320
And they all seemed to be very far away.

35
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:43,120
Looking into space far away means very long ago, because light takes so long to reach us.

36
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,440
Quasars were common in the early universe, having peaked in number 10 billion years ago

37
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,000
when galaxies, and the universe itself, were still very young.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,920
Let's go back in time, just 3 billion years after the Big Bang,

39
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,600
and see what was going on back then.

40
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,960
The incredible power of quasars.

41
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,360
How could an early baby galaxy be so incredibly bright and violent?

42
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,520
All that light and radiation couldn't be stars, as there weren't nearly enough of them.

43
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,760
And since galaxies tend to grow with time by merging,

44
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,560
the starlight from small galaxies shouldn't be far brighter than any galaxy today.

45
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,280
There's only one way to generate the vast amounts of energy a quasar shines with.

46
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
Feeding supermassive black holes.

47
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,880
We still don't know how exactly they formed,

48
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,760
but it seems that every galaxy has one in their center.

49
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,680
But how can the brightest things in the universe be black holes,

50
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,960
which trap anything and everything that crosses their event horizon?

51
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,840
Well, the light of a quasar is not coming from inside these black holes.

52
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,400
Rather, it comes from the space around them,

53
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,920
a massive orbiting disk of gas called an accretion disk.

54
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,080
Quasars use the same fuel as stars to shine.

55
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,480
Matter.

56
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,760
It's just that black holes are the most efficient engines

57
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,080
for converting matter into energy in the universe.

58
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,600
The energy released by matter falling into a black hole

59
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,080
can be 60 times greater than that released by nuclear fusion in the core of a star,

60
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,120
because the energy released by a black hole comes from gravity, not from nuclear reactions.

61
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,360
Matter falling into a black hole speeds up to almost the speed of light

62
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,680
before it crosses the event horizon, buzzing with an incredible amount of kinetic energy.

63
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,640
Of course, once inside the black hole, it takes that energy with it.

64
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,400
You only get to witness this energy if you drop your matter in the right way.

65
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,920
Fall straight down and the outside universe gets nothing.

66
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,520
But when you have a lot of matter,

67
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,000
it spirals in incredibly fast towards the event horizon, forming a disk.

68
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,200
Collisions between particles and friction heated up to hundreds of thousands of degrees.

69
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,640
In a space not much bigger than our solar system,

70
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,200
the core of a galaxy can release many times more energy than all its stars combined.

71
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,000
This is what a quasar is.

72
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,600
A supermassive black hole having a feast.

73
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,800
And these black holes eat a lot.

74
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,720
Typical quasars consume one to a hundred earth masses of gas per minute.

75
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,520
Ten billion years ago, the universe was about a third of its current size.

76
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,560
So the intergalactic medium was much less spread out,

77
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,480
meaning the filaments of gas around quasars could feed them a banquet,

78
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,440
making them vomit insane amounts of light and radiation.

79
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,720
The brightest quasars power jets,

80
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,160
tangling the magnetic field of the matter around them into a narrow cone.

81
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,960
Like a particle accelerator, they launch enormous beams of matter out,

82
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,120
plowing through the circumgalactic medium,

83
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,120
forming plumes of matter that grow to hundreds of thousands of light years in size.

84
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,080
It's almost unfathomable in scale.

85
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,640
A tiny spot in a galaxy carving out patches of the universe

86
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,640
hundreds of thousands of light years long.

87
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,720
But quasars can't eat for long, maybe a few million years,

88
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,520
because their feast ultimately kills their galaxy.

89
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,640
How quasars kill galaxies.

90
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,640
Okay, maybe killing is a bit of an exaggeration.

91
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,920
A galaxy is still there after its quasar turns off,

92
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,440
but it will never be the same again.

93
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,680
Quasars, being among the hottest and brightest things in the universe,

94
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,840
break their galaxies by heating them up too much and stopping star formation.

95
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,680
Stars are gas that collapsed in on itself and then got really hot.

96
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,080
But in a cloud of gas that's already hot, atoms are moving quickly.

97
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,800
When they collide, they hit hard, exerting pressure that resists gravity's squeeze.

98
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,080
So hot gas cannot form stars.

99
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,880
Instead, the best gas for forming stars is already cold

100
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,680
and won't put up a fight when it's time to collapse into a star.

101
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,840
On top of that, quasars push gas out of their galaxies.

102
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,440
Not only does this starve the quasar, but its galaxy loses the raw materials for new stars.

103
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,360
As sad as this sounds, it might be a good thing for life.

104
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,600
The alternative can be far more dangerous. Too many stars.

105
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,440
New stars forming is usually followed by massive stars exploding in supernovae,

106
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,360
so planets would be burned sterile.

107
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,160
But of course, it's more complicated.

108
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,840
Like the intricacies of our own planet's biosphere,

109
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,080
every piece of the galaxy is depended on

110
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,280
and influencing every other part of the galactic environment.

111
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,400
While hot things like quasars and supernovae tend to push gas out of the galaxy,

112
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,680
shockwaves and quasar jets can also compress gas, making new stars at least for a short time.

113
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,760
But in general, we can say that without things becoming a bit more chill,

114
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,520
we would not exist today.

115
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
Which brings us to our final question.

116
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,480
Did the Milky Way have a quasar in the past?

117
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,400
It's unclear if every galaxy went through a quasar phase,

118
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,560
but understanding distant quasars may provide clues to the history of the Milky Way.

119
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,400
Galaxies don't do a good job of preserving their history.

120
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,880
Like sand on a beach, the endless churning mixes away the clues to their past.

121
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,560
It's possible the Milky Way was once a quasar,

122
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,320
which may have allowed our supermassive black hole Sagittarius A star

123
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,960
to have grown to four million times the mass of the Sun.

124
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,880
And as dormant as it is now, Sagittarius A star could turn into a quasar in the future.

125
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,040
In a few billion years, the Milky Way will merge with Andromeda.

126
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,600
We've seen over a hundred double quasars in galaxies smashing together,

127
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,400
where fresh gas is provided for the central black holes.

128
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,320
But it won't last for long.

129
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,400
When galaxies merge, so do their supermassive black holes,

130
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,200
sinking into the center of their new galaxy, kicking up dust and stars in every direction.

131
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,880
We don't know whether this will happen, but it would truly be an incredible sight.

132
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,960
Maybe some beings in the far future are going to witness it, and be in awe of what they see.

133
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,640
But you don't have to wait that long.

134
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,840
There are already plenty of fascinating things to explore,

135
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,560
right here on this planet, right now, if you have the knowledge to understand them.

136
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,200
