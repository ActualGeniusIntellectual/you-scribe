0	6720	The universe looks like a vast, empty ocean sprinkled with rare islands of galaxies.
6720	9240	But this is an illusion.
9240	12440	Just a small fraction of all atoms are found in galaxies,
12440	17520	while the rest is thought to be drifting in between, in the intergalactic medium.
17520	19840	Like the roots of some massive tree,
19840	26720	gas spreads out from each galaxy, gravity funneling fresh mass into this dense cosmic forest.
26960	31360	Here in the intergalactic medium are the raw materials of creation.
31360	36640	Hydrogen and helium, woven into sheets and filaments that flow into galaxies,
36640	39600	where they eventually create stars.
39600	43440	But if we look closely, we see who's actually in charge.
43440	48080	Quasars, the single most powerful objects in existence.
48080	51280	As small as a grain of sand compared to the Amazon River,
51280	56320	they reside in the centers of some galaxies, shining with the power of a trillion stars,
56320	61600	blasting out huge jets of matter, completely reshaping the cosmos around them.
61600	65280	They're so powerful that they can kill a galaxy.
65280	70160	What are they, and how do they mold the structure of the universe at their whim?
78320	82560	Everywhere you look, weird things in the sky.
82560	89200	In the 1950s, astronomers noticed mysterious loud radio waves coming from spots all over the sky.
89200	95760	They were named quasi-stellar radio sources, or quasars, because they were dots like stars,
95760	99840	but were seen in radio waves rather than visible light.
99840	102400	Everything about them was strange.
102400	107520	Some flickered, others emitted high-energy X-rays in addition to radio waves,
107520	109920	but all seemed to be tiny.
109920	115040	They all moved extremely fast, as much as over 30% the speed of light.
115040	118320	The only explanation was that they must have been so distant
118320	123200	that their apparent speed was actually the expansion of the universe, moving them away from us.
123200	128000	But these enormous distances meant that quasars couldn't just be stars,
128000	132560	but the active cores of galaxies billions of light-years away.
132560	134320	And it gets crazier.
134320	138560	To appear so bright and loud, given these vast distances,
138560	142720	they are thousands of times brighter than the entire Milky Way.
142720	149600	Monsters exploding and screaming into the void with a violence not thought possible before.
149600	153680	As we mapped the sky, we discovered over a million quasars.
153680	156320	And they all seemed to be very far away.
156320	163120	Looking into space far away means very long ago, because light takes so long to reach us.
163120	167440	Quasars were common in the early universe, having peaked in number 10 billion years ago
167440	172000	when galaxies, and the universe itself, were still very young.
172000	175920	Let's go back in time, just 3 billion years after the Big Bang,
175920	177600	and see what was going on back then.
178720	180960	The incredible power of quasars.
182480	187360	How could an early baby galaxy be so incredibly bright and violent?
187360	191520	All that light and radiation couldn't be stars, as there weren't nearly enough of them.
192240	195760	And since galaxies tend to grow with time by merging,
195760	200560	the starlight from small galaxies shouldn't be far brighter than any galaxy today.
201200	205280	There's only one way to generate the vast amounts of energy a quasar shines with.
205920	207920	Feeding supermassive black holes.
208480	210880	We still don't know how exactly they formed,
210880	213760	but it seems that every galaxy has one in their center.
214400	217680	But how can the brightest things in the universe be black holes,
217680	220960	which trap anything and everything that crosses their event horizon?
221520	225840	Well, the light of a quasar is not coming from inside these black holes.
225840	228400	Rather, it comes from the space around them,
228400	231920	a massive orbiting disk of gas called an accretion disk.
232800	236080	Quasars use the same fuel as stars to shine.
236080	236480	Matter.
237120	239760	It's just that black holes are the most efficient engines
239760	242080	for converting matter into energy in the universe.
242880	245600	The energy released by matter falling into a black hole
245600	250080	can be 60 times greater than that released by nuclear fusion in the core of a star,
250080	255120	because the energy released by a black hole comes from gravity, not from nuclear reactions.
255920	259360	Matter falling into a black hole speeds up to almost the speed of light
259360	263680	before it crosses the event horizon, buzzing with an incredible amount of kinetic energy.
264560	268640	Of course, once inside the black hole, it takes that energy with it.
269520	274400	You only get to witness this energy if you drop your matter in the right way.
274400	277920	Fall straight down and the outside universe gets nothing.
277920	279520	But when you have a lot of matter,
279520	284000	it spirals in incredibly fast towards the event horizon, forming a disk.
284720	289200	Collisions between particles and friction heated up to hundreds of thousands of degrees.
290080	292640	In a space not much bigger than our solar system,
292640	297200	the core of a galaxy can release many times more energy than all its stars combined.
298160	300000	This is what a quasar is.
300720	303600	A supermassive black hole having a feast.
304240	306800	And these black holes eat a lot.
306800	310720	Typical quasars consume one to a hundred earth masses of gas per minute.
311600	315520	Ten billion years ago, the universe was about a third of its current size.
315520	318560	So the intergalactic medium was much less spread out,
318560	322480	meaning the filaments of gas around quasars could feed them a banquet,
322480	325440	making them vomit insane amounts of light and radiation.
326240	328720	The brightest quasars power jets,
328720	332160	tangling the magnetic field of the matter around them into a narrow cone.
332960	336960	Like a particle accelerator, they launch enormous beams of matter out,
336960	339120	plowing through the circumgalactic medium,
339120	343120	forming plumes of matter that grow to hundreds of thousands of light years in size.
343680	346080	It's almost unfathomable in scale.
346640	350640	A tiny spot in a galaxy carving out patches of the universe
350640	352640	hundreds of thousands of light years long.
353360	356720	But quasars can't eat for long, maybe a few million years,
356720	359520	because their feast ultimately kills their galaxy.
359520	362640	How quasars kill galaxies.
363600	366640	Okay, maybe killing is a bit of an exaggeration.
366640	369920	A galaxy is still there after its quasar turns off,
369920	371440	but it will never be the same again.
372160	375680	Quasars, being among the hottest and brightest things in the universe,
375680	379840	break their galaxies by heating them up too much and stopping star formation.
380400	383680	Stars are gas that collapsed in on itself and then got really hot.
384240	388080	But in a cloud of gas that's already hot, atoms are moving quickly.
388080	392800	When they collide, they hit hard, exerting pressure that resists gravity's squeeze.
393520	396080	So hot gas cannot form stars.
396960	400880	Instead, the best gas for forming stars is already cold
400880	403680	and won't put up a fight when it's time to collapse into a star.
404560	407840	On top of that, quasars push gas out of their galaxies.
408400	413440	Not only does this starve the quasar, but its galaxy loses the raw materials for new stars.
414240	417360	As sad as this sounds, it might be a good thing for life.
418080	421600	The alternative can be far more dangerous. Too many stars.
422400	427440	New stars forming is usually followed by massive stars exploding in supernovae,
427440	429360	so planets would be burned sterile.
430240	432160	But of course, it's more complicated.
433120	435840	Like the intricacies of our own planet's biosphere,
435840	438080	every piece of the galaxy is depended on
438080	441280	and influencing every other part of the galactic environment.
441840	446400	While hot things like quasars and supernovae tend to push gas out of the galaxy,
446400	451680	shockwaves and quasar jets can also compress gas, making new stars at least for a short time.
452240	455760	But in general, we can say that without things becoming a bit more chill,
455760	457520	we would not exist today.
457520	459520	Which brings us to our final question.
460160	462480	Did the Milky Way have a quasar in the past?
463200	466400	It's unclear if every galaxy went through a quasar phase,
466400	470560	but understanding distant quasars may provide clues to the history of the Milky Way.
471280	474400	Galaxies don't do a good job of preserving their history.
474400	478880	Like sand on a beach, the endless churning mixes away the clues to their past.
479680	482560	It's possible the Milky Way was once a quasar,
482560	486320	which may have allowed our supermassive black hole Sagittarius A star
486320	488960	to have grown to four million times the mass of the Sun.
489600	494880	And as dormant as it is now, Sagittarius A star could turn into a quasar in the future.
495520	499040	In a few billion years, the Milky Way will merge with Andromeda.
499600	503600	We've seen over a hundred double quasars in galaxies smashing together,
503600	506400	where fresh gas is provided for the central black holes.
507040	508320	But it won't last for long.
508880	512400	When galaxies merge, so do their supermassive black holes,
512400	517200	sinking into the center of their new galaxy, kicking up dust and stars in every direction.
517840	522880	We don't know whether this will happen, but it would truly be an incredible sight.
522880	528960	Maybe some beings in the far future are going to witness it, and be in awe of what they see.
530560	532640	But you don't have to wait that long.
