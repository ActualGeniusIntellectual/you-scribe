1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Size matters. Let's make Earth twice as large.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,640
It now has a diameter of roughly 25,500 kilometers and is eight times as heavy.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,200
It now rotates 32 times slower, meaning one day lasts more than a month.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,880
The force of gravity is twice as strong and since weight is determined by gravity,

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,120
all objects on Earth would be twice as heavy.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,280
Your life expectancy would decline as your heart would

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,160
now have to pump twice as hard to circulate blood in your body.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,880
The weight of trees and plants would cause them to fall over.

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,360
This also concerns the plants we depend on for food,

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,000
leading to massive food shortages and starvation.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,080
For animals, the situation is similar.

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,720
Hunting becomes more difficult, especially for larger animals,

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,040
as they are slowed down by increased gravity.

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,560
Over the course of many generations,

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,360
nature would find a way to deal with these changing conditions.

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,480
The bones of humans and animals will become thicker and stronger.

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,880
At the same time, our bodies are getting smaller, adapting to the increased force of gravity.

18
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,520
Also, the overall height of vegetation would decrease

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,160
to ensure a sufficient supply of water and nutrients.

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,760
Overall, we would live in a very different world, showing that Earth's...
