0	3040	Size matters. Let's make Earth twice as large.
3040	8640	It now has a diameter of roughly 25,500 kilometers and is eight times as heavy.
8640	13200	It now rotates 32 times slower, meaning one day lasts more than a month.
13200	16880	The force of gravity is twice as strong and since weight is determined by gravity,
16880	19120	all objects on Earth would be twice as heavy.
19120	21280	Your life expectancy would decline as your heart would
21280	24160	now have to pump twice as hard to circulate blood in your body.
24160	26880	The weight of trees and plants would cause them to fall over.
26880	29360	This also concerns the plants we depend on for food,
29360	32000	leading to massive food shortages and starvation.
32000	34080	For animals, the situation is similar.
34080	36720	Hunting becomes more difficult, especially for larger animals,
36720	39040	as they are slowed down by increased gravity.
39040	40560	Over the course of many generations,
40560	43360	nature would find a way to deal with these changing conditions.
43360	46480	The bones of humans and animals will become thicker and stronger.
46480	50880	At the same time, our bodies are getting smaller, adapting to the increased force of gravity.
50880	53520	Also, the overall height of vegetation would decrease
53520	56160	to ensure a sufficient supply of water and nutrients.
56160	59760	Overall, we would live in a very different world, showing that Earth's...
