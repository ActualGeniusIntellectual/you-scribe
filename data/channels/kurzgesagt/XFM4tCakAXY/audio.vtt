00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
Size matters. Let's make Earth twice as large.

00:03.040 --> 00:08.640
It now has a diameter of roughly 25,500 kilometers and is eight times as heavy.

00:08.640 --> 00:13.200
It now rotates 32 times slower, meaning one day lasts more than a month.

00:13.200 --> 00:16.880
The force of gravity is twice as strong and since weight is determined by gravity,

00:16.880 --> 00:19.120
all objects on Earth would be twice as heavy.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.280
Your life expectancy would decline as your heart would

00:21.280 --> 00:24.160
now have to pump twice as hard to circulate blood in your body.

00:24.160 --> 00:26.880
The weight of trees and plants would cause them to fall over.

00:26.880 --> 00:29.360
This also concerns the plants we depend on for food,

00:29.360 --> 00:32.000
leading to massive food shortages and starvation.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.080
For animals, the situation is similar.

00:34.080 --> 00:36.720
Hunting becomes more difficult, especially for larger animals,

00:36.720 --> 00:39.040
as they are slowed down by increased gravity.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.560
Over the course of many generations,

00:40.560 --> 00:43.360
nature would find a way to deal with these changing conditions.

00:43.360 --> 00:46.480
The bones of humans and animals will become thicker and stronger.

00:46.480 --> 00:50.880
At the same time, our bodies are getting smaller, adapting to the increased force of gravity.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.520
Also, the overall height of vegetation would decrease

00:53.520 --> 00:56.160
to ensure a sufficient supply of water and nutrients.

00:56.160 --> 00:59.760
Overall, we would live in a very different world, showing that Earth's...
