1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
Why does humanity exist at this time in the universe?

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,080
The universe is already 13.8 billion years old,

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,520
but it's unlikely that many other technological civilizations had a chance to appear before us.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,800
Because in the earlier universe, life would have had a pretty hard time to emerge,

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,080
let alone thrive, because it was such a hostile environment.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,120
Early stars constantly blew up, galaxies crashed into each other,

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,200
and supermassive black holes vomited massive amounts of radiation,

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,720
enough to sterilize galaxies over and over again.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,280
Our sun was born right at the end of this cosmic death show.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,280
The universe has never been more welcoming to life than it is now,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,840
so humanity has arrived at a very convenient spot in time,

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,200
maybe the earliest reasonably possible for life to thrive.
