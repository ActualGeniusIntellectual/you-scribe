0	3280	Why does humanity exist at this time in the universe?
4720	8080	The universe is already 13.8 billion years old,
8080	13520	but it's unlikely that many other technological civilizations had a chance to appear before us.
14480	18800	Because in the earlier universe, life would have had a pretty hard time to emerge,
18800	22080	let alone thrive, because it was such a hostile environment.
23040	27120	Early stars constantly blew up, galaxies crashed into each other,
27120	31200	and supermassive black holes vomited massive amounts of radiation,
31840	34720	enough to sterilize galaxies over and over again.
35600	39280	Our sun was born right at the end of this cosmic death show.
40000	43280	The universe has never been more welcoming to life than it is now,
44000	47840	so humanity has arrived at a very convenient spot in time,
47840	51200	maybe the earliest reasonably possible for life to thrive.
