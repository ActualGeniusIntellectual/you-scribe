00:00.000 --> 00:03.280
Why does humanity exist at this time in the universe?

00:04.720 --> 00:08.080
The universe is already 13.8 billion years old,

00:08.080 --> 00:13.520
but it's unlikely that many other technological civilizations had a chance to appear before us.

00:14.480 --> 00:18.800
Because in the earlier universe, life would have had a pretty hard time to emerge,

00:18.800 --> 00:22.080
let alone thrive, because it was such a hostile environment.

00:23.040 --> 00:27.120
Early stars constantly blew up, galaxies crashed into each other,

00:27.120 --> 00:31.200
and supermassive black holes vomited massive amounts of radiation,

00:31.840 --> 00:34.720
enough to sterilize galaxies over and over again.

00:35.600 --> 00:39.280
Our sun was born right at the end of this cosmic death show.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.280
The universe has never been more welcoming to life than it is now,

00:44.000 --> 00:47.840
so humanity has arrived at a very convenient spot in time,

00:47.840 --> 00:51.200
maybe the earliest reasonably possible for life to thrive.
