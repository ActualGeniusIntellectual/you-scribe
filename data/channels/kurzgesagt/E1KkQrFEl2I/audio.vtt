00:00.000 --> 00:11.640
In and out. In and out. Staying alive is about doing things. This very second, your cells are

00:11.640 --> 00:18.180
combusting glucose molecules with oxygen to make energy available, which keeps you alive for another

00:18.180 --> 00:25.800
precious moment. To get the oxygen to your cells, you're breathing. Breathing is an answer to a very

00:25.880 --> 00:32.440
hard problem. How do you get the resources that your cells need to survive from the outside to

00:32.440 --> 00:38.240
the inside of your cells? Every living thing has to solve this problem, and the solution is

00:38.240 --> 00:45.960
surprisingly different depending on one of the most important regulators of life, size. As we've

00:45.960 --> 00:50.960
discussed in other videos, at different scales, the physical laws of the universe have different

00:50.960 --> 00:57.080
consequences for its inhabitants. Simple things like temperature, microgravity, or surface tension

00:57.080 --> 01:03.400
might not matter to you or be a deadly danger, depending on how big you are. Living things need

01:03.400 --> 01:08.400
a lot of different materials to keep themselves going, and they somehow need to transport them

01:08.400 --> 01:14.440
from the outside to the inside. This was a huge problem for the first things on the verge of being

01:14.440 --> 01:20.560
alive, because doing anything in our universe requires energy, and the first living beings on

01:20.660 --> 01:26.240
Earth did not have the abundance of tools and techniques available that life has today after

01:26.240 --> 01:32.920
billions of years of evolution. So at the very beginning, life needed to find a way to get good

01:32.920 --> 01:39.440
stuff inside and bad stuff outside of itself without using energy. Luckily, the very first

01:39.440 --> 01:46.240
forms of life were very, very small. And because they were so small, they were able to use a free

01:46.280 --> 01:53.240
form of transport that was based on a physical law called diffusion. Diffusion is the rule of

01:53.240 --> 01:59.680
the universe that molecules, especially in liquids or gases, are constantly moving around in all

01:59.680 --> 02:05.920
directions. And because they move around and bump into each other and other molecules, they tend to

02:05.920 --> 02:12.280
spread. For example, if you drop a sugar cube into water, then there is a lot of sugar in one place,

02:12.320 --> 02:18.760
and in another place, there's none. As sugar molecules dissolve in the water, they will start

02:18.760 --> 02:24.880
randomly bumping against the water molecules and other sugar molecules. Slowly, all the sugar

02:24.880 --> 02:31.680
molecules will spread out and form multiple phases of different concentrations. These random movements

02:31.680 --> 02:38.480
continue endlessly until at some point, the sugar will be spread evenly in the water. The great thing

02:38.480 --> 02:45.800
about diffusion is that life can use it for free. It doesn't require energy. And life loves free

02:45.800 --> 02:53.520
things. So all life on Earth relies on diffusion. Let's look at the smallest living being on Earth,

02:53.520 --> 03:01.600
a bacterium, specifically its surfaces. Cell membranes allow for diffusion of certain molecules.

03:01.640 --> 03:09.040
This specific bacterium consumes oxygen to live while carbon dioxide is produced inside as a waste

03:09.040 --> 03:16.920
product. So inside the bacterium, there isn't a lot of oxygen, but a lot of carbon dioxide. Because

03:16.920 --> 03:22.540
of diffusion, these molecules will eventually spread evenly, so the carbon dioxide diffuses

03:22.540 --> 03:29.840
out while oxygen is constantly replenished from the outside. But this kind of breathing only works

03:29.960 --> 03:37.800
for the very small world, for bacteria, amoeba or your cells, and a few very small animals. Insects,

03:37.800 --> 03:42.920
for example, have a fine network of trachea, tunnels with a pressure gradient where air very

03:42.920 --> 03:49.640
slowly can diffuse in and exchange gases with the insect cells. But even insects seem to be able to

03:49.640 --> 03:54.840
contract their trachea, and at least some even have specialized breathing organs like spiracles

03:54.880 --> 04:03.680
and air sacs. At certain scales, diffusion is just too slow to keep cells alive. The fundamental

04:03.680 --> 04:09.360
problem is that the exchange with the environment can only happen at the surface, and diffusion of

04:09.360 --> 04:17.760
materials can only sustain a certain amount of inside. Tiny living things have only a little bit

04:17.760 --> 04:25.520
of inside or volume, and a lot of outside or surface area. But what if we wanted to create

04:25.520 --> 04:33.240
a bacteria the size of a blue whale and had a very convenient enlargement machine? We would sadly be

04:33.240 --> 04:38.680
messed up by the square cube law. In a nutshell, it means that if you make something 10 times

04:38.680 --> 04:47.560
larger, its outside or surface would grow by 100, but its insides or volume grows by 1000 times.

04:47.560 --> 04:54.920
If we compare the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a blue whale, we see that the bacterium has

04:54.920 --> 05:01.880
10 million times more surface in relation to its volume than the whale. The bacterium has a lot of

05:01.880 --> 05:07.840
outsides, while the whale has a lot of insides. If we make a bacterium the size of a whale,

05:07.840 --> 05:14.440
our giant bacteria now has too much insides, and most of its inside is now very far from its

05:14.440 --> 05:20.640
surface. The oxygen our bacterium needs would never reach the inside before it would run out

05:20.640 --> 05:29.840
of oxygen. Our giant bacterium would just die. Still, being bigger has many upsides. From making

05:29.840 --> 05:36.680
it harder to be eaten to making it easier to eat others. But the size of cells is limited by the

05:36.680 --> 05:42.040
distance oxygen and nutrients can effectively diffuse to provide the inside with enough

05:42.040 --> 05:48.160
resources. So life avoided this problem by forming a multi-cellular structures,

05:48.160 --> 05:55.720
beings composed of many cells instead of one, because diffusion works better if you have many

05:55.720 --> 06:02.760
small units instead of one much bigger one. Over time, the cell buddies began to share work and

06:02.760 --> 06:10.440
specialize. Some cells concentrated on sensing the environment, others on digestion, others on

06:10.440 --> 06:16.760
movement. But that still wasn't enough. The problem of diffusion and surface and energy

06:16.760 --> 06:22.880
production remained limiting the size these first multi-cellular forms of life could attain. So,

06:22.880 --> 06:29.480
in order to become even bigger, life solved the diffusion problem by having holes and caves and

06:29.480 --> 06:35.120
tunnels and by folding in on itself. So diffusion could happen easily in each one of the cells.

06:35.120 --> 06:42.960
Take yourself. What you consider your outside, your skin, has a surface area of about 2 square

06:42.960 --> 06:49.800
meters. But your lungs have a surface area of about 70 square meters. They aren't like balloons,

06:49.800 --> 06:55.040
they're more like sponges filled with many tightly packed tiny balloons surrounded by

06:55.040 --> 07:02.120
blood vessels. When you breathe in, all these tiny balloons fill up with fresh air. Blood filled up

07:02.120 --> 07:10.640
with CO2 is pumped around the balloons and then the magic of diffusion happens. The oxygen diffuses

07:10.640 --> 07:16.520
into the blood where it's picked up by red blood cells and the CO2 diffuses out of the blood and

07:16.520 --> 07:23.840
into your lungs where it can be breathed out again. Your blood then carries oxygen-rich blood into the

07:23.840 --> 07:30.680
furthest corners of your body and picks up the CO2 waste. Diffusion in the body is effective at

07:30.720 --> 07:38.240
about 1 millimeter, so every cell in your body is at most 1 millimeter away from a blood vessel. So

07:38.240 --> 07:45.040
medium-sized animals like you need a lot of blood vessels to reach every cell in the body. Your body

07:45.040 --> 07:50.840
has around 100,000 kilometers of capillaries alone, the tiniest of your blood vessels,

07:50.840 --> 07:57.960
with a surface area of around 1,000 square meters. This is true for all parts of you that want to

07:57.960 --> 08:03.640
exchange something with the outside world. Your body needs surfaces to take in nutrients from your

08:03.640 --> 08:10.500
food, so your gut has the surface area of half a badminton court, roughly 40 square meters. The

08:10.500 --> 08:17.040
larger you are, the more hidden surfaces you need. Take a tree. Its way to stay alive is to create

08:17.040 --> 08:23.680
sugar out of thin air and sunlight, so it needs as much surface area as possible. An orange tree

08:23.720 --> 08:31.000
with 2,000 leaves has a leaf surface area of 200 square meters, but the surface inside the leaves,

08:31.000 --> 08:38.320
where diffusion actually occurs, is 6,000 square meters. The same with roots, where water diffuses

08:38.320 --> 08:44.440
from the soil into countless tiny hairs that maximize the surface area. The roots of 1 square

08:44.440 --> 08:51.600
meter of grass add up to around 350 square meters of surface. If we look at the breathtaking

08:52.000 --> 08:59.840
diversity of life on this planet, it seems like everything is pretty different, and it is. But

08:59.840 --> 09:06.600
some basic principles are the same for everybody and have not changed significantly for billions

09:06.600 --> 09:14.080
of years. If we look at the very, very small or the very, very big, waste goes out and fresh fuel

09:14.080 --> 09:22.680
comes in. Big animals just need a lot of complex plumbing to make it possible. Fresh fuel is

09:22.680 --> 09:27.920
something we can all use from time to time, especially for our creativity. All it really

09:27.920 --> 09:33.520
takes is to try something new, and we have the perfect opportunity to get you started. We

09:33.520 --> 09:37.760
