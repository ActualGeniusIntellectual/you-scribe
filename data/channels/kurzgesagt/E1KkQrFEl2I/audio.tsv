0	11640	In and out. In and out. Staying alive is about doing things. This very second, your cells are
11640	18180	combusting glucose molecules with oxygen to make energy available, which keeps you alive for another
18180	25800	precious moment. To get the oxygen to your cells, you're breathing. Breathing is an answer to a very
25880	32440	hard problem. How do you get the resources that your cells need to survive from the outside to
32440	38240	the inside of your cells? Every living thing has to solve this problem, and the solution is
38240	45960	surprisingly different depending on one of the most important regulators of life, size. As we've
45960	50960	discussed in other videos, at different scales, the physical laws of the universe have different
50960	57080	consequences for its inhabitants. Simple things like temperature, microgravity, or surface tension
57080	63400	might not matter to you or be a deadly danger, depending on how big you are. Living things need
63400	68400	a lot of different materials to keep themselves going, and they somehow need to transport them
68400	74440	from the outside to the inside. This was a huge problem for the first things on the verge of being
74440	80560	alive, because doing anything in our universe requires energy, and the first living beings on
80660	86240	Earth did not have the abundance of tools and techniques available that life has today after
86240	92920	billions of years of evolution. So at the very beginning, life needed to find a way to get good
92920	99440	stuff inside and bad stuff outside of itself without using energy. Luckily, the very first
99440	106240	forms of life were very, very small. And because they were so small, they were able to use a free
106280	113240	form of transport that was based on a physical law called diffusion. Diffusion is the rule of
113240	119680	the universe that molecules, especially in liquids or gases, are constantly moving around in all
119680	125920	directions. And because they move around and bump into each other and other molecules, they tend to
125920	132280	spread. For example, if you drop a sugar cube into water, then there is a lot of sugar in one place,
132320	138760	and in another place, there's none. As sugar molecules dissolve in the water, they will start
138760	144880	randomly bumping against the water molecules and other sugar molecules. Slowly, all the sugar
144880	151680	molecules will spread out and form multiple phases of different concentrations. These random movements
151680	158480	continue endlessly until at some point, the sugar will be spread evenly in the water. The great thing
158480	165800	about diffusion is that life can use it for free. It doesn't require energy. And life loves free
165800	173520	things. So all life on Earth relies on diffusion. Let's look at the smallest living being on Earth,
173520	181600	a bacterium, specifically its surfaces. Cell membranes allow for diffusion of certain molecules.
181640	189040	This specific bacterium consumes oxygen to live while carbon dioxide is produced inside as a waste
189040	196920	product. So inside the bacterium, there isn't a lot of oxygen, but a lot of carbon dioxide. Because
196920	202540	of diffusion, these molecules will eventually spread evenly, so the carbon dioxide diffuses
202540	209840	out while oxygen is constantly replenished from the outside. But this kind of breathing only works
209960	217800	for the very small world, for bacteria, amoeba or your cells, and a few very small animals. Insects,
217800	222920	for example, have a fine network of trachea, tunnels with a pressure gradient where air very
222920	229640	slowly can diffuse in and exchange gases with the insect cells. But even insects seem to be able to
229640	234840	contract their trachea, and at least some even have specialized breathing organs like spiracles
234880	243680	and air sacs. At certain scales, diffusion is just too slow to keep cells alive. The fundamental
243680	249360	problem is that the exchange with the environment can only happen at the surface, and diffusion of
249360	257760	materials can only sustain a certain amount of inside. Tiny living things have only a little bit
257760	265520	of inside or volume, and a lot of outside or surface area. But what if we wanted to create
265520	273240	a bacteria the size of a blue whale and had a very convenient enlargement machine? We would sadly be
273240	278680	messed up by the square cube law. In a nutshell, it means that if you make something 10 times
278680	287560	larger, its outside or surface would grow by 100, but its insides or volume grows by 1000 times.
287560	294920	If we compare the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a blue whale, we see that the bacterium has
294920	301880	10 million times more surface in relation to its volume than the whale. The bacterium has a lot of
301880	307840	outsides, while the whale has a lot of insides. If we make a bacterium the size of a whale,
307840	314440	our giant bacteria now has too much insides, and most of its inside is now very far from its
314440	320640	surface. The oxygen our bacterium needs would never reach the inside before it would run out
320640	329840	of oxygen. Our giant bacterium would just die. Still, being bigger has many upsides. From making
329840	336680	it harder to be eaten to making it easier to eat others. But the size of cells is limited by the
336680	342040	distance oxygen and nutrients can effectively diffuse to provide the inside with enough
342040	348160	resources. So life avoided this problem by forming a multi-cellular structures,
348160	355720	beings composed of many cells instead of one, because diffusion works better if you have many
355720	362760	small units instead of one much bigger one. Over time, the cell buddies began to share work and
362760	370440	specialize. Some cells concentrated on sensing the environment, others on digestion, others on
370440	376760	movement. But that still wasn't enough. The problem of diffusion and surface and energy
376760	382880	production remained limiting the size these first multi-cellular forms of life could attain. So,
382880	389480	in order to become even bigger, life solved the diffusion problem by having holes and caves and
389480	395120	tunnels and by folding in on itself. So diffusion could happen easily in each one of the cells.
395120	402960	Take yourself. What you consider your outside, your skin, has a surface area of about 2 square
402960	409800	meters. But your lungs have a surface area of about 70 square meters. They aren't like balloons,
409800	415040	they're more like sponges filled with many tightly packed tiny balloons surrounded by
415040	422120	blood vessels. When you breathe in, all these tiny balloons fill up with fresh air. Blood filled up
422120	430640	with CO2 is pumped around the balloons and then the magic of diffusion happens. The oxygen diffuses
430640	436520	into the blood where it's picked up by red blood cells and the CO2 diffuses out of the blood and
436520	443840	into your lungs where it can be breathed out again. Your blood then carries oxygen-rich blood into the
443840	450680	furthest corners of your body and picks up the CO2 waste. Diffusion in the body is effective at
450720	458240	about 1 millimeter, so every cell in your body is at most 1 millimeter away from a blood vessel. So
458240	465040	medium-sized animals like you need a lot of blood vessels to reach every cell in the body. Your body
465040	470840	has around 100,000 kilometers of capillaries alone, the tiniest of your blood vessels,
470840	477960	with a surface area of around 1,000 square meters. This is true for all parts of you that want to
477960	483640	exchange something with the outside world. Your body needs surfaces to take in nutrients from your
483640	490500	food, so your gut has the surface area of half a badminton court, roughly 40 square meters. The
490500	497040	larger you are, the more hidden surfaces you need. Take a tree. Its way to stay alive is to create
497040	503680	sugar out of thin air and sunlight, so it needs as much surface area as possible. An orange tree
503720	511000	with 2,000 leaves has a leaf surface area of 200 square meters, but the surface inside the leaves,
511000	518320	where diffusion actually occurs, is 6,000 square meters. The same with roots, where water diffuses
518320	524440	from the soil into countless tiny hairs that maximize the surface area. The roots of 1 square
524440	531600	meter of grass add up to around 350 square meters of surface. If we look at the breathtaking
532000	539840	diversity of life on this planet, it seems like everything is pretty different, and it is. But
539840	546600	some basic principles are the same for everybody and have not changed significantly for billions
546600	554080	of years. If we look at the very, very small or the very, very big, waste goes out and fresh fuel
554080	562680	comes in. Big animals just need a lot of complex plumbing to make it possible. Fresh fuel is
562680	567920	something we can all use from time to time, especially for our creativity. All it really
567920	573520	takes is to try something new, and we have the perfect opportunity to get you started. We
573520	577760	partnered with Skillshare, an online learning community that offers courses on almost any
