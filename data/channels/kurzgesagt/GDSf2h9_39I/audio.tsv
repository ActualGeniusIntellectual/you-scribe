0	6160	The universe is magnificent and vast, hundreds of billions of galaxies, trillions of stars,
6160	12160	and even more planets. If even the tiniest fraction are habitable, then the universe
12160	18640	should be teeming with life, and yet we see nothing, only vast emptiness. Where is everyone
18640	26560	else? The answer to this riddle could be as exciting as it is creepy. We are early,
26560	34720	born before almost all other life. But very soon, this may change. Not only might aliens appear,
34720	40640	they could quickly surround us. An irreversible competition for the universe might be about to
40640	55600	begin. While this video is based on scientific papers, we're presenting interesting ideas based
55600	62320	on little data and lots of extrapolation, so take them with a grain of salt. Okay, we need to look
62320	69360	at three essential questions to understand the galactic competition. One, how fast can bacteria
69360	74640	build spaceships? To become a star-faring civilization, life as we know it needs to
74640	80880	master a number of very hard steps. It starts with dead stuff turning into the building blocks of
80880	87680	life. Then it needs to organize into self-contained cells. Those cells have to learn to work together
87680	94400	to form multicellular organisms. This keeps going until complex creatures with big brains learn to
94400	100560	use tools and language. Civilization has to be formed from cultures that value progress
100560	106160	and technological development, and then they need to actually venture out beyond their home planet.
106160	113360	On Earth, life appeared basically as soon as the oceans formed. But then it took two billion years
113360	119440	to make the step from single cells to multicellular organisms and two billion more for us to appear.
119440	127280	Culture, civilization, and space travel developed super quickly though. Do things always take that
127280	134080	long, or was this actually exceptionally fast? Also, passing one step does not mean the next one is
134080	141040	guaranteed. Multicellularity evolved over 25 times independently on Earth, but there's only one
141040	147280	species that builds spaceships. We don't know how many steps life needs to pass and how long they
147280	152880	take to give rise to a technological civilization, but there are probably many, and it's likely that
152880	159600	on trillions of planets, life has been trying for billions of years. Since we don't see any other
159600	165040	technological civilizations out there, it might well be that we are a rare exception. We might be
165040	172080	among the first, or even the first technological civilization in the Milky Way. But this is just
172080	177200	one piece of the puzzle. On top of that, we may have just hit the perfect time window.
178000	187200	Why does humanity exist now? The universe is already 13.8 billion years old, but it's unlikely
187200	193280	that many other technological civilizations had a chance to appear before us. Because in the earlier
193280	198720	universe, life would have had a pretty hard time to emerge, let alone thrive, because it was such
198720	205360	a hostile environment. Early stars constantly blew up, galaxies crashed into each other, and
205360	211760	supermassive black holes vomited massive amounts of radiation. Enough to sterilize galaxies over
211760	218800	and over again. Our sun was born right at the end of this cosmic death show. The universe has never
218800	224960	been more welcoming to life than it is now. So humanity has arrived at a very convenient spot in
224960	231840	time, maybe the earliest reasonably possible for life to thrive. What about the future? The sun
231840	238400	burns brighter than 90% of the stars in our galaxy, and will keep getting brighter. In about a billion
238400	243040	years, it will boil all of Earth's oceans and then become a giant that swallows it whole.
243840	251280	So in the galactic context, the sun is very short lived. Most stars are red dwarfs that can sustain
251280	258000	habitable planets for tens of trillions of years. Life on these planets has an incredibly long time
258000	264800	window to appear and pass the hard steps. Even knowing nothing about how rare or common life is,
264800	270400	this makes it way more likely for technological civilizations to appear sometime in the future
270400	276400	than in the past. Because if civilizations appear at random in the Milky Way within a time window
276400	283760	of a trillion years, then very few, if any, would appear before today. Then a couple more arrive in
283760	288960	this period of a billion years that we're in, before all starfaring civilizations that could
288960	295760	ever exist emerge altogether. This weird tsunami like distribution is the result of both the hard
295760	302320	steps model and something else. A sort of deadline for any spacefaring civilization.
302960	309520	Any civilization coming after will find it hard to have room to survive. So all potential life
309520	316400	has to cram in before it. Humanity exists now, because otherwise, we might have missed this
316400	324320	deadline. What or who creates this deadline? Why aren't aliens already on Earth?
326160	332320	Humans are curious, expansionist, and hungry for energy. We've spread over the world and made it
332320	338880	our own. Our technology has been improving over time, first slowly, then breathtakingly fast.
339680	344400	If these things don't change drastically, and our descendants want to prosper,
344400	351040	they will expand into space. We could construct a Dyson swarm for endless energy and transform
351040	357200	planets into new homes. We could cross interstellar distances, allowing us to reach for planets around
357200	364480	distant stars. If we have the motivation, we can become a galactic civilization. A civilization
364480	369600	that does this sort of stuff can be called loud, because its activity creates noise,
370320	376480	signs that can be detected from far away. Imagine someone in a forest, cutting down trees,
376480	382960	starting fires, and laying down roads. The more intense their work, the easier they are to notice.
382960	388400	An expanding technological civilization would probably be hard to miss. Our telescopes would
388400	393600	pick up all that energy, and we would clearly identify artificial interference with stars and
393600	399200	planets. Another consequence of this business is that it's very disruptive to the environment.
400000	405920	Clearing a forest means the end of its wildlife. Human activity has left no chance for a squirrel
405920	411200	civilization to appear. Not because we hated squirrels, it's simply that the thought that
411200	417120	they might want to do that at some point never crossed our minds, and we needed word. Similarly,
417120	422080	if loud civilizations were running around the galaxy in the past, terraforming planets or
422080	427600	harvesting the energy of stars, they may have prevented our existence. Had aliens started
427600	431920	colonizing Earth while we were still sludge in the oceans, that sludge would never have
431920	438640	turned into humans. This is how loud aliens create a deadline for new civilizations appearing.
439360	444400	The galaxy may have trillions of years to create life, but there may only be a short window for it
444400	450640	to spread and thrive. Even if a loud civilization respects planets with naturally occurring life
450640	454560	and expands around them, like humans do with wildlife reserves,
454560	461360	any civilization on such a planet would not be able to expand ever, trapped forever on a tiny
461360	468560	island. But here we are, so loud aliens were probably never here. What about aliens that
468560	475520	don't expand? They would be quiet aliens. They're probably limited to one star system and don't have
475520	481440	a noticeable impact on their cosmic surroundings. Humanity is like this right now. We wouldn't be
481440	486400	able to detect ourselves from the other side of the Milky Way. If they stay quiet forever,
486400	490880	maybe because of their culture or abilities, then they are not really a concern for us.
491840	498080	We only have one sample to draw from, humanity, and right now, we are on the path to becoming
498080	504480	loud. If we're not special and succeed anyway, then any other civilization with the motivation
504480	508480	and resources to would eventually expand beyond its planet of origin.
509280	512960	Okay, what are the consequences of all these assumptions and ideas?
514400	520880	Grave consequences. Race to the stars. If we are really early, then eventually,
520880	526800	others will catch up with us. Civilizations will emerge all over the place, and these new aliens
526800	532400	will look at space, see no signs of life, and come to the same conclusion. They exist because
532400	537920	loud civilizations have not yet taken over everything, but it only takes one loud civilization
537920	545280	to crowd them out of the entire galaxy. They, like us, will face an important decision. Do they stay
545280	551280	quiet, take it easy, and tend to their planet for as long as possible, or do they start expanding
551280	558160	to take a chunk of the galaxy before someone else arrives? Mating others does not necessarily mean
558160	563920	war or conflict, but it means that new borders will arise, limits that may persist forever.
564560	569840	In the worst case, a civilization could be completely enveloped by the empires of others,
569840	574800	eternally doomed to be a galactic backwater, without control over their fate.
575600	582160	So if we want a seat at the galactic adults table, we best get to work. If we really are early,
582160	587920	we have an incredible opportunity. To mold thousands or even millions of planets
587920	594320	according to our vision and dreams. And one day, when we meet others, we can greet them
594320	600640	and meet them as equals. Wouldn't that be nice? If you want to explore the vast universe from the
