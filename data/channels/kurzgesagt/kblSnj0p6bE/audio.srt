1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
What happens if the Earth suddenly stops rotating?

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,300
Anything that isn't attached to its surface remains at its initial speed.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,000
Not just cars, buildings, and people, but also water and our atmosphere,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
causing giant tsunami waves and global windstorms.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,800
Areas near the equator where the Earth's rotational speed was the fastest would be affected the strongest.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,500
There, everything would continue to move forward at 1,600 kmph.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,100
Don't forget the long-term effects.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,100
Over billions of years, centripetal forces have made Earth a bit wider at the equator.

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,400
Without rotation, these forces would vanish.

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,100
Oceans would migrate to the poles, which are closer to the center of the Earth and have stronger gravity.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,400
So we're left with dry land around the equator.

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,300
Also, our usual day-night cycle would cease to exist.

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,800
Without rotation, one day lasts one year, with six months each of daylight and darkness.

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,600
And Earth's magnetic field, which is partly generated by the rotation of our planet,

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,000
might be altered once the Earth stops rotating.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,500
As a result, we might face higher exposure to deadly solar radiation.

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,100
Quite dramatic changes, in case you've ever wondered.
