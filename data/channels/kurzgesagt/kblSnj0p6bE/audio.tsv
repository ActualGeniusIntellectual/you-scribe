0	2800	What happens if the Earth suddenly stops rotating?
2800	6300	Anything that isn't attached to its surface remains at its initial speed.
6300	10000	Not just cars, buildings, and people, but also water and our atmosphere,
10000	13000	causing giant tsunami waves and global windstorms.
13000	17800	Areas near the equator where the Earth's rotational speed was the fastest would be affected the strongest.
17800	22500	There, everything would continue to move forward at 1,600 kmph.
22500	24100	Don't forget the long-term effects.
24100	28100	Over billions of years, centripetal forces have made Earth a bit wider at the equator.
28100	30400	Without rotation, these forces would vanish.
30400	35100	Oceans would migrate to the poles, which are closer to the center of the Earth and have stronger gravity.
35100	37400	So we're left with dry land around the equator.
37400	40300	Also, our usual day-night cycle would cease to exist.
40300	44800	Without rotation, one day lasts one year, with six months each of daylight and darkness.
44800	48600	And Earth's magnetic field, which is partly generated by the rotation of our planet,
48600	51000	might be altered once the Earth stops rotating.
51000	54500	As a result, we might face higher exposure to deadly solar radiation.
54500	57100	Quite dramatic changes, in case you've ever wondered.
