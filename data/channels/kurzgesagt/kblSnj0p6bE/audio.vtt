00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
What happens if the Earth suddenly stops rotating?

00:02.800 --> 00:06.300
Anything that isn't attached to its surface remains at its initial speed.

00:06.300 --> 00:10.000
Not just cars, buildings, and people, but also water and our atmosphere,

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
causing giant tsunami waves and global windstorms.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.800
Areas near the equator where the Earth's rotational speed was the fastest would be affected the strongest.

00:17.800 --> 00:22.500
There, everything would continue to move forward at 1,600 kmph.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.100
Don't forget the long-term effects.

00:24.100 --> 00:28.100
Over billions of years, centripetal forces have made Earth a bit wider at the equator.

00:28.100 --> 00:30.400
Without rotation, these forces would vanish.

00:30.400 --> 00:35.100
Oceans would migrate to the poles, which are closer to the center of the Earth and have stronger gravity.

00:35.100 --> 00:37.400
So we're left with dry land around the equator.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.300
Also, our usual day-night cycle would cease to exist.

00:40.300 --> 00:44.800
Without rotation, one day lasts one year, with six months each of daylight and darkness.

00:44.800 --> 00:48.600
And Earth's magnetic field, which is partly generated by the rotation of our planet,

00:48.600 --> 00:51.000
might be altered once the Earth stops rotating.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.500
As a result, we might face higher exposure to deadly solar radiation.

00:54.500 --> 00:57.100
Quite dramatic changes, in case you've ever wondered.
