00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Somewhere in your body, your immune system just quietly killed one of your own cells, stopping it from becoming cancer and saving your life.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
It does that all the time.

00:12.000 --> 00:21.000
The vast majority of cancer cells you develop will be killed without you ever noticing, which is an incredibly hard job because of what cancer cells are.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
Parts of yourself that start to behave as individuals, even if it hurts you.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
What is cancer and how does your body kill it all the time?

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Cancer is when corrupted cells multiply uncontrollably.

00:42.000 --> 00:49.000
It can emerge from basically every type of cell in your body, so there's not just a single type of cancer, but hundreds.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
Some grow slowly, others are aggressive, some can be treated effectively, others are deadly.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
In a sense, a cell that becomes cancer turns into something ancient and something new.

01:00.000 --> 01:08.000
Over billions of years, evolution has molded cells to survive and thrive in a hostile environment, fighting for space and resources.

01:08.000 --> 01:18.000
Until a new and exciting way of life emerged, cooperation, a division of labor that allowed cells to specialize and become more successful together.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
But cooperation requires sacrifices.

01:21.000 --> 01:29.000
For a multicellular being to stay healthy, the well-being of the collective has to matter more than the survival of the individual cell.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
Cancer cells stop being part of the collective and become individuals again.

01:34.000 --> 01:41.000
Your body can handle a few rogue cells, but some cancer cells divide again and again, becoming a sort of new organism within you,

01:41.000 --> 01:49.000
taking resources you need to survive, competing for the space you inhabit, destroying the organs they were part of in the process.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
Despite the harm they cause, cancer cells are not evil. They don't want to hurt you, they don't want anything.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
Cells are protein robots that just follow their programming, which unfortunately has been corrupted.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
The soul of the cell.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
In a nutshell, your cells have a nucleus filled with DNA.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
It consists of genes, instructions for how to build proteins and when to make each one.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.000
These building instructions are copied and transferred to ribosomes, where they're used to make proteins.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
What kind of proteins your cells make determine what they can do.

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
The important thing here is that a corrupt gene means you get a corrupt protein, which will get important later.

02:28.000 --> 02:35.000
Your DNA gets a tiny bit corrupted. It mutates tens of thousands of times each day.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Most of the time without any special cause, just by being alive.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
Almost all of these mutations are fixed very quickly or are not problematic.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
Still, over time as your cells make copies of themselves, damage is accumulating.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
Imagine having to make copies from copies from copies for decades.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Maybe one day a hair got on the scanner or a corner got frayed.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
Each new mistake becomes part of the new copies and all the copies that follow.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
You can increase DNA damage by doing things like smoking, drinking alcohol, by being obese,

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
breathing in asbestos, by not using sunscreen or contracting a virus like HPV.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
But the simplest way to damage DNA and get cancer is to be alive long enough.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
For many cancer cases, there is no cause other than bad luck.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
The damage that leads to cancer.

03:27.000 --> 03:34.000
We are simplifying, but roughly there are three categories of genes that need to be corrupted so cancer can arise.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.000
The first key mutation is in the appropriately named tumor suppressor genes or TSGs.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
These genes are a bunch of things.

03:42.000 --> 03:49.000
For one, they produce control mechanisms that continuously scan your DNA for mistakes and copying errors and fix them right away.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
And then they keep normal cells from multiplying recklessly.

03:52.000 --> 03:59.000
If TSGs become damaged, your cells basically forget how to repair themselves and can reproduce unchecked.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
The second crucial mutation can happen in your oncogenes.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
When oncogenes are turned on, the cell is told to multiply rapidly.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
They were super active when you were inside your mother's womb.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
To turn a single original cell into trillions in months, it needs to divide and grow rapidly.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
These rapid growth genes are turned off when there is enough of you.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
When your oncogenes get corrupted, they basically turn on again.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
The third crucial mutation is in your cell's suicide switch.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
Most cells are constantly recycled and refreshed.

04:32.000 --> 04:40.000
When cells amass too much damage, they usually notice and special genes trigger a controlled suicide called apoptosis.

04:40.000 --> 04:47.000
If the genes that control this process get damaged, cells are free to live on despite being dangerously corrupted.

04:47.000 --> 04:54.000
So if a cell becomes unable to fix the mistakes in its genetic code, loses the ability to destroy itself when it notices the damage,

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
and begins to grow rapidly without restraint, it turns into a young cancer cell.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
These cells have to be killed as quickly as possible.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
While they are bad at this stage, they are still pretty weak and easy to kill.

05:07.000 --> 05:14.000
But if they continue to mutate and increase in number, they can learn to avoid your defenses and become a real threat.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
At any moment of your life, your immune system is hunting these cells.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
But how do you identify and kill corrupted cells that seem indistinguishable from healthy ones?

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
How to find cancer?

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
Well, here we come back to the proteins your cells produce and the story they tell.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
So if, for example, your oncogenes switch back on, they make oncogene proteins.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
Your immune system knows that they should not be present if you're an adult.

05:39.000 --> 05:46.000
So to know which cells are corrupt and which are healthy, your immune system needs to know what proteins they're making inside.

05:46.000 --> 05:53.000
To solve this, evolution came up with MHC class 1 molecules, a sort of display window that makes cells transparent.

05:53.000 --> 06:01.000
Cells constantly take little samples of the proteins they make and put them into thousands of these MHC molecules to showcase what they're doing.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
The selection is constantly refreshed, always giving an up-to-date picture.

06:05.000 --> 06:13.000
There's a whole library of proteins that are highly dangerous and should not be made by healthy cells, and your immune system has them all on file.

06:13.000 --> 06:19.000
It has billions of specialized cells called T cells made to recognize specific proteins.

06:19.000 --> 06:28.000
If a T cell sees a forbidden protein in an MHC display window, it knows that the cell is corrupted and kills it immediately.

06:28.000 --> 06:34.000
But there's a flaw in this system. What if a cancer cell mutates and finds a way to circumvent this process?

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
All it needs to do is to stop making MHC class 1 molecules and boom, it's invisible.

06:40.000 --> 06:46.000
Without display windows, the immune system is blind and can't identify cancer anymore.

06:46.000 --> 06:55.000
Fortunately, evolution found an ingenious solution. The natural killer cell. A judge, jury, and executioner.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
The killer.

06:56.000 --> 07:06.000
At this very second, hundreds of millions of natural killer cells are patrolling your body looking for cells that have already turned into cancer or are corrupted by a virus.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
Natural killer cells go from cell to cell to check for one thing.

07:10.000 --> 07:19.000
Does a cell have MHC class 1 molecules? Does it have a display window, and is it doing its duty of showing off what's going on inside itself?

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
This is so amazing because it covers all of your bases.

07:22.000 --> 07:32.000
While T cells look for the presence of the unexpected, something that should not be here, natural killer cells look for the absence of the expected, the absence of something that should be here.

07:32.000 --> 07:40.000
The logic is, if a cell does not have display windows, it wants to hide something, and a cell that hides something must be killed.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
What makes the natural killer cell even more metal is that it's always in murder mode.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
It patrols your body, checking cell after cell with the intention of killing it.

07:49.000 --> 07:57.000
Your healthy cells have to convince it that they should not die today, and a way to do that is to have MHC class 1 molecules.

07:58.000 --> 08:04.000
So, in summary, almost all young cancer cells you will ever develop in your life will be killed by your immune system.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
Okay, but if your body is this prepared, why do we still get cancer?

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
Well, sometimes cancer cells mutate more and get much better at fighting back.

08:13.000 --> 08:20.000
Cancer is a story of an arms race, an arms race that we will win eventually, maybe with the help of natural killer cells.

08:20.000 --> 08:29.000
Right now, a number of therapies are beginning to show amazing promise, from cancer-fighting vaccines, to engineered T cells, and even natural killer cells.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
We'll look at these therapies in future videos.

08:32.000 --> 08:42.000
So the war is not won yet, but we are on to cancer, and eventually, it will be eliminated once and for all, maybe sooner than we think.

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
