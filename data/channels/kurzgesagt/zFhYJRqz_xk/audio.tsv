0	10000	Somewhere in your body, your immune system just quietly killed one of your own cells, stopping it from becoming cancer and saving your life.
10000	12000	It does that all the time.
12000	21000	The vast majority of cancer cells you develop will be killed without you ever noticing, which is an incredibly hard job because of what cancer cells are.
21000	26000	Parts of yourself that start to behave as individuals, even if it hurts you.
26000	30000	What is cancer and how does your body kill it all the time?
38000	42000	Cancer is when corrupted cells multiply uncontrollably.
42000	49000	It can emerge from basically every type of cell in your body, so there's not just a single type of cancer, but hundreds.
49000	55000	Some grow slowly, others are aggressive, some can be treated effectively, others are deadly.
55000	60000	In a sense, a cell that becomes cancer turns into something ancient and something new.
60000	68000	Over billions of years, evolution has molded cells to survive and thrive in a hostile environment, fighting for space and resources.
68000	78000	Until a new and exciting way of life emerged, cooperation, a division of labor that allowed cells to specialize and become more successful together.
78000	81000	But cooperation requires sacrifices.
81000	89000	For a multicellular being to stay healthy, the well-being of the collective has to matter more than the survival of the individual cell.
89000	94000	Cancer cells stop being part of the collective and become individuals again.
94000	101000	Your body can handle a few rogue cells, but some cancer cells divide again and again, becoming a sort of new organism within you,
101000	109000	taking resources you need to survive, competing for the space you inhabit, destroying the organs they were part of in the process.
109000	115000	Despite the harm they cause, cancer cells are not evil. They don't want to hurt you, they don't want anything.
115000	121000	Cells are protein robots that just follow their programming, which unfortunately has been corrupted.
121000	123000	The soul of the cell.
123000	127000	In a nutshell, your cells have a nucleus filled with DNA.
127000	132000	It consists of genes, instructions for how to build proteins and when to make each one.
132000	138000	These building instructions are copied and transferred to ribosomes, where they're used to make proteins.
138000	142000	What kind of proteins your cells make determine what they can do.
142000	148000	The important thing here is that a corrupt gene means you get a corrupt protein, which will get important later.
148000	155000	Your DNA gets a tiny bit corrupted. It mutates tens of thousands of times each day.
155000	159000	Most of the time without any special cause, just by being alive.
159000	164000	Almost all of these mutations are fixed very quickly or are not problematic.
164000	169000	Still, over time as your cells make copies of themselves, damage is accumulating.
169000	174000	Imagine having to make copies from copies from copies for decades.
174000	178000	Maybe one day a hair got on the scanner or a corner got frayed.
178000	183000	Each new mistake becomes part of the new copies and all the copies that follow.
183000	189000	You can increase DNA damage by doing things like smoking, drinking alcohol, by being obese,
189000	194000	breathing in asbestos, by not using sunscreen or contracting a virus like HPV.
194000	199000	But the simplest way to damage DNA and get cancer is to be alive long enough.
199000	204000	For many cancer cases, there is no cause other than bad luck.
204000	207000	The damage that leads to cancer.
207000	214000	We are simplifying, but roughly there are three categories of genes that need to be corrupted so cancer can arise.
214000	220000	The first key mutation is in the appropriately named tumor suppressor genes or TSGs.
220000	222000	These genes are a bunch of things.
222000	229000	For one, they produce control mechanisms that continuously scan your DNA for mistakes and copying errors and fix them right away.
229000	232000	And then they keep normal cells from multiplying recklessly.
232000	239000	If TSGs become damaged, your cells basically forget how to repair themselves and can reproduce unchecked.
239000	243000	The second crucial mutation can happen in your oncogenes.
243000	247000	When oncogenes are turned on, the cell is told to multiply rapidly.
247000	250000	They were super active when you were inside your mother's womb.
250000	256000	To turn a single original cell into trillions in months, it needs to divide and grow rapidly.
256000	260000	These rapid growth genes are turned off when there is enough of you.
260000	264000	When your oncogenes get corrupted, they basically turn on again.
264000	268000	The third crucial mutation is in your cell's suicide switch.
268000	272000	Most cells are constantly recycled and refreshed.
272000	280000	When cells amass too much damage, they usually notice and special genes trigger a controlled suicide called apoptosis.
280000	287000	If the genes that control this process get damaged, cells are free to live on despite being dangerously corrupted.
287000	294000	So if a cell becomes unable to fix the mistakes in its genetic code, loses the ability to destroy itself when it notices the damage,
294000	299000	and begins to grow rapidly without restraint, it turns into a young cancer cell.
299000	302000	These cells have to be killed as quickly as possible.
302000	307000	While they are bad at this stage, they are still pretty weak and easy to kill.
307000	314000	But if they continue to mutate and increase in number, they can learn to avoid your defenses and become a real threat.
314000	318000	At any moment of your life, your immune system is hunting these cells.
318000	324000	But how do you identify and kill corrupted cells that seem indistinguishable from healthy ones?
325000	327000	How to find cancer?
327000	331000	Well, here we come back to the proteins your cells produce and the story they tell.
331000	336000	So if, for example, your oncogenes switch back on, they make oncogene proteins.
336000	339000	Your immune system knows that they should not be present if you're an adult.
339000	346000	So to know which cells are corrupt and which are healthy, your immune system needs to know what proteins they're making inside.
346000	353000	To solve this, evolution came up with MHC class 1 molecules, a sort of display window that makes cells transparent.
353000	361000	Cells constantly take little samples of the proteins they make and put them into thousands of these MHC molecules to showcase what they're doing.
361000	365000	The selection is constantly refreshed, always giving an up-to-date picture.
365000	373000	There's a whole library of proteins that are highly dangerous and should not be made by healthy cells, and your immune system has them all on file.
373000	379000	It has billions of specialized cells called T cells made to recognize specific proteins.
379000	388000	If a T cell sees a forbidden protein in an MHC display window, it knows that the cell is corrupted and kills it immediately.
388000	394000	But there's a flaw in this system. What if a cancer cell mutates and finds a way to circumvent this process?
394000	400000	All it needs to do is to stop making MHC class 1 molecules and boom, it's invisible.
400000	406000	Without display windows, the immune system is blind and can't identify cancer anymore.
406000	415000	Fortunately, evolution found an ingenious solution. The natural killer cell. A judge, jury, and executioner.
415000	416000	The killer.
416000	426000	At this very second, hundreds of millions of natural killer cells are patrolling your body looking for cells that have already turned into cancer or are corrupted by a virus.
426000	430000	Natural killer cells go from cell to cell to check for one thing.
430000	439000	Does a cell have MHC class 1 molecules? Does it have a display window, and is it doing its duty of showing off what's going on inside itself?
439000	442000	This is so amazing because it covers all of your bases.
442000	452000	While T cells look for the presence of the unexpected, something that should not be here, natural killer cells look for the absence of the expected, the absence of something that should be here.
452000	460000	The logic is, if a cell does not have display windows, it wants to hide something, and a cell that hides something must be killed.
460000	465000	What makes the natural killer cell even more metal is that it's always in murder mode.
465000	469000	It patrols your body, checking cell after cell with the intention of killing it.
469000	477000	Your healthy cells have to convince it that they should not die today, and a way to do that is to have MHC class 1 molecules.
478000	484000	So, in summary, almost all young cancer cells you will ever develop in your life will be killed by your immune system.
484000	488000	Okay, but if your body is this prepared, why do we still get cancer?
488000	493000	Well, sometimes cancer cells mutate more and get much better at fighting back.
493000	500000	Cancer is a story of an arms race, an arms race that we will win eventually, maybe with the help of natural killer cells.
500000	509000	Right now, a number of therapies are beginning to show amazing promise, from cancer-fighting vaccines, to engineered T cells, and even natural killer cells.
509000	512000	We'll look at these therapies in future videos.
512000	522000	So the war is not won yet, but we are on to cancer, and eventually, it will be eliminated once and for all, maybe sooner than we think.
